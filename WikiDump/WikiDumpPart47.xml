      <text xml:space="preserve">==Brood Parasitism==
Common cuckoos (''Cuculus canorus'') in Europe, and brown-headed cowbirds (''Molothrus ater'') in North America lay their eggs in the nests of other species and leave them to the care of their respective host. A Cuckoo female searches for an unguarded nest of another species and then replaces an egg in it with one of her own. The mother then abandons her egg leaving it to be raised by the nest's natural owners. Clearly, lacking a distinct ability to identify and remove foreign eggs from among its clutch appears maladaptive.

As an example of an evolutionary arms race, cukoos have adapted their kleptoparasitic strategies to the host behavior. Upon return, hosts may reject the foreign egg if it is a poor match, added at the wrong time of day, or the cukoo's presence has been witnessed. Different cuckoo strains exhibit distinct preferences for a specific host species which provide a close visual match to their own eggs. Likewise, hosts have adapted to selection from cuckoos where species suffering high amounts of parasitism are much better at identifying and removing cuckoo eggs than those who suffer little. When parents remove an egg from their nest they do risk removing one of their own or breaking some of the others in the process. Whether taking such risks will be worth it depends on the overall rate of parasitism and the ability to discriminate foreign from own eggs.

In contrast to cuckoos, brownheaded cowbirds exhibit little preference for nests of a specific song bird species. Moreover, their eggs fail to show close mimicry to those of their hosts. Removal of parasitic eggs is much more variable, high in some species and rare in others. Although cowbird fledglings do not evict their nest mates, up to 50% of the nests may be parasitized in some areas.

The lack of co-evolution in brood parasitism of cowbirds compared to that of cuckoos is puzzling. Do these two cases represent different stages of the arms race? Are cowbirds in the early parts of the game while cuckoos have had a chance to adapt for a much longer time? Has the recent change in North America landscape from forest to agricultural lands brought cowbirds into contact with a much greater number of new hosts? Alternatively, both species may be at an evolutionary equilibrium with stabilizing selection. Differing degrees of rejection may well depend on their respective costs of rejecting vs. accepting any given egg.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two components to a camping latrine: the &quot;commode&quot;, and an enclosure.  

;Enclosure: The purpose of the enclosure is to provide privacy.  It can be as simple as hanging tarps from rope stretched between trees and well-secured.  You can also make a teepee from tarps and poles, or build a more elaborate structure from poles using lashings, and covering that with tarps.  Another possibility is to use an old tent with its floor removed.  

;Commode: There are many ways to build the commode portion of a latrine.  One common approach is to mount a toilet seat on some sort of structure, such as a small log cabin-like structure built using 3-inch (8 cm) diameter logs.  It is also possible to build a structure from lumber fastened together with hinges so that it can be collapsed at will (but remain uncollapsed otherwise!) for transport.  Another way to build the commode is by lashing poles together to make a couple of horizontal rails - one for sitting on, and another as a back rest.  However the commode is built, it is almost always situated over a hole dug in the ground to hold the waste.  The depth of this hole depends on how much usage the latrine is expected to accommodate.  Leave the dirt pile and a shovel inside the enclosure so that the waste may be gradually buried as it is created.  This will hold down the smell.  Be sure to completely bury the hole when breaking camp.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Coevolution and Evolutionary Arms Races==
Coevolution describes the relationship between species where each exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. It includes the evolution of a host species and its parasites, predator-prey scenarios, or examples of mutualism evolving through time. As in any complex scenario, explanatory attempts will tempt us to consider ''ad-hoc'' explanations that are intuitively appealing but in many instances spectacularly wrong. There is no alternative to using such explanations as functional hypotheses and to subject them to rigorous experimental examination. Moreover, we need to look beyond the current status and consider the likely paths such a system of co-evolution may have undergone in the past. Our final consideration needs to go to the end points of this arms races. Has it ended in a stalemate rather than with the demise of one of the protagonists?

===The Rough-skinned Newt and the Common Garter Snake===
Newts are generally slow-moving animals with few defenses. Forming a major component in the diet of Garter Snakes a system of co-evolutionary adaptations appears to have given rise to a spectacular case of an evolutionary arms race &lt;ref&gt;Brodie et al. 2004. Parallel Arms Races between Garter Snakes and Newts Involving Tetrodotoxin as the Phenotypic Interface of Coevolution. J Chem Ecol 31(2): 343-356&lt;/ref&gt;. Rough-skinned Newts, common on the western coast of North America, produce extremely high amounts of Tetrodotoxin, a potent blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve cell membranes. With levels of toxin far exceeding what is needed to kill any other conceivable predator, it is only ingested by garter snakes with a high degree of immunity to the toxin throughout much of the newt's range. In the early stages of this interaction, some newts with an ability to excrete tedrodotoxin may have gained a relative advantage over their conspecifics. With predation pressure selecting for higher levels of poison in newts, snakes with some level of resistance to the poison were deriving a relative advantage. Such resistance emerged through a mutation in sodium channel structure, which retain much of its functionality yet made it less susceptible to a block by tedrodotoxin. Continuing to select for higher levels of toxin on one hand and increased tolerance to it in snakes, the present system may have emerged. The system's progression has, however, entered a stable end point when further increases in immunity to the toxin could only be achieved with a concurrent decrease in neuronal functioning. 

At present, newts appear to have won the upper hand. Individual snakes with the highest levels of resistance to the toxin are also characterized by a reduction in motor abilities. Although able to handle even the most toxic newts, this ability is hard-won as it renders them at much greater risks of predation themselves.

In some areas snakes may have prevailed in the evolutionary arms race between predator and prey. Surprisingly, snakes in several geographic locations have developed such extreme resistance to TTX that newt production of the toxin cannot keep up &lt;ref&gt;Hanifin CT, Brodie ED Jr., Brodie ED III. 2008. Phenotypic Mismatches Reveal Escape from Arms-Race Coevolution, PLoS Biol 6(3): e60. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0060060&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal Domestication===

Domestication is the process in which a relationship between humans and animals shapes the population of both. For years, humans have domesticated animals as a source of food and clothing, companionship, and for travel &lt;ref&gt;McGrath J. 2008. How Animal Domestication works. Dog. Domestication, Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;. Humans pick a particular trait that they like in an animal, find it in a male and female, and then encourage the two to breed. This process is known as artificial selection. It is important to distinguish between animal domestication and taming. Taming refers to the relationship between a single animal and a single person.


	 Dogs are believed to be the first domesticated animal, but time and location of the beginning, is disputed. Although paleolithic hunters and gatherers domesticated dogs to assist them in hunting, domestication may have started even before then in Southwest Asia (evidence based off of a 14,000 year old dog grave) &lt;ref&gt;McGrath J. 2008. How Animal Domestication works. Dog. Domestication, Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;. This was followed by the domestication of sheep and goats (Southwest Asia, 10,000 years ago), cats (Cyprus 10,000 years ago), pigs (Central Asia, 10,000 years ago, and cattle (Northwest Asia, 5,000 years ago).
In addition to changes in behavior, most domesticated animals have smaller brains and senses that are less keen &lt;ref&gt; Diamond J. 2002. Evolution, consequences of plant and animal domestication, Nature 418 (701) &lt;/ref&gt;. This is believed to be due to a release from the need to survive in the wild.
	Domestication is largely a selection for Neotenic characteristics, where individuals retain juvenile forms and behaviors into adulthood &lt;ref&gt; Yong, E. 2009. Genetic Neoteny, how delayed genes separate human brains from chimps, scienceblogs &lt;/ref&gt;.

	Human biology has changed from this as well. Before the domestication of cattle, the human digestive system would become lactose intolerant once they the period of breast feeding had passed. Consumption of cow milk in adults selected for digestive systems that were able  handle it &lt;ref&gt;McGrath J. 2008. How Animal Domestication works. Dog. Domestication, Encyclopedia Britanicna&lt;/ref&gt;.
Not all animals are equally suited to domestication. In fact, only about 14 species have undergone successful domestication by humans. A number of key factors aid in domestication, including an easily sustainable diet, reduced levels of aggression, a strong group structure, a capacity to cede the dominant position, and a lack of specific mating conditions

''If you like kraut, you will like this one.''

''See also: [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]]''

==Ingredients==

* 5 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]
* 10 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==

# Clean old leaves off cabbage heads.
# Quarter heads and slice off cores.
# Shred cabbage.
# Put 5 pounds cabbage and salt in large pan and mix with hands.
# Pack into crock with [[Cookbook:Potato Masher|potato masher]]. Pack gently.
# When crock is nearly full, cover with cloth, plate, and weight.
# Check daily and remove scum.
# When kraut is sour enough, you can leave it in crock, and seal it with parafin wax; or kraut can be sealed in sterilized glass jars, adding enough brine to fill the jar. Process for 15 minutes below boiling point.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* It takes six to eight days to ferment in summer weather.
* If it's cooler, it might take up to twelve days.

==Uses==

* Is there anything better on a fat sausage or even just a hot dog?

RAM is an acronym that stands for Random Access Memory.  &quot;Random access&quot; means that the contents of the memory can be accessed in any random order.  The term was originally coined to differentiate it from serial memory (such as data stored on a magnetic tape).  The contents of a serial memory could only be accessed sequentially.  RAM is a volatile memory, which means that when the power is turned off, the information stored there is lost.

RAM can be accessed very quickly by the computer.  Its contents can be both read and written.  Most programs on a computer are loaded into and executed from RAM.  RAM is also used as &quot;scratch space&quot; where the computer stores the results of calculations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A hard drive is a nonvolatile data storage device.  It works by the same principals as a floppy disc, except that it is much faster, has much greater storage capacity, and is usually not removable from the computer.  Most hard drives consist of several aluminum platters stacked on a spindle.  The platters (or disks) are coated with a material whose magnetic properties are easily detected (for reading) and changed (for writing).  The computer's operating system is usually stored on the hard drive as are most of the other programs the computer runs.  Data stored on a hard drive will not be destroyed if the computer is turned off.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A computer keyboard is a peripheral modelled after the typewriter keyboard. Keyboards are designed for the input of text and characters, and also to control the operation of the computer. Physically, computer keyboards are an arrangement of rectangular or near-rectangular buttons, or &quot;keys&quot;. Keyboards typically have characters engraved or printed on the keys; in most cases, each press of a key corresponds to a single written symbol. However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously, or in sequence; other keys do not produce any symbol, but instead affect the operation of the computer, or the keyboard itself. 

[[Image:QWERTY.png|A 102-key US English keyboard]]

:Roughly 50% of all keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or signs (characters). Other keys can produce actions when pressed, and other actions are available by simultaneously pressing more than one action key.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A document that tells the bank to transfer funds from an enterprise bank account to the person or organization to whom the check is payable.  A check often consists of two parts: the negotiable part and the remittance advice.  The negotiable part is presented to the bank to start the funds transfer.  The remittance advice lists the invoices that are being paid and how much is being paid on each.  It is kept by the person or organization that received the check.  In the case of a payroll check, the remittance advice summarizes the pay and deductions as well as giving YTD totals for various pay and deduction amounts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Part ownership of a corporation. Often, there are millions of shares and tens of thousands of shareholders. Shares pay dividends and are divided into two classes: preferred and common. Preferred shares are guaranteed a dividend but generally don't have the right to vote. Stock splits can be declared when the share price has grown too large. Each old share is replaced by two, three, or more new shares of lesser value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Some enterprises own machinery that must be serviced to ensure maximum life and uptime.  Preventive Maintenance collects the hours that machines have been operated and schedules service. Contrast this with Service Management.  Not every ERP package has a Preventative Maintenance module although all the large ones do.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]
== Tables ==
The first table is the Unit table which contains one record for every machine requiring preventative maintenance and the second table is the Maintenance table which contains one record for every maintenance performed.  There is at least one maintenance record for every unit and there can be many.
==Data Exchange==
Preventative Maintenance does not send or receive transactions to/from other modules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most current inkjets work by having a print cartridge with a series of tiny electrically-heated chambers. To produce an image, the printer runs a pulse of current through the heating elements. A steam explosion in the chamber forms a bubble, which propels a droplet of ink onto the paper (hence Canon's tradename for its inkjets, Bubblejet). When the bubble condenses, surplus ink is sucked back up from the printing surface. The ink's surface tension pumps another charge of ink into the chamber through a narrow channel attached to an ink reservoir. 

Compared to earlier consumer-oriented printers, ink jets have a number of advantages. They are quieter in operation than impact dot matrix or daisywheel printers. They can print finer, smoother details through higher printhead resolution, and many ink jets with photorealistic-quality color printing are widely available.

The disadvantages of inkjets include flimsy print heads (prone to clogging) and expensive ink cartridges (sometimes costing US$30 – $40 or more). This typically leads value-minded consumers to consider laser printers for medium-to-high volume printer applications.

A common business model for inkjet printers involves selling the actual printer at or even below production cost, while dramatically marking up the price of the (proprietary) ink cartridges.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A laser printer is a common type of computer printer that produces high quality printing, and is able to produce both text and graphics.

An electric charge is first projected onto a revolving drum. The drum has a surface of a special plastic or garnet. Electronics drive a system that writes light onto the drum with a laser. The light causes the electrostatic charge to leak from the exposed parts of the drum. The surface of the drum passes through a bath of very fine particles of dry plastic powder, or toner. The charged parts of the drum electrostatically attract the particles of powder. The drum then deposits the powder on a piece of paper. The paper passes through a fuser, which, with heat and pressure, bonds the plastic powder to the paper.

Laser printers are the workhorse printer of the business world.  They are capable of producing very high quality prints very cheaply.  Although most laser printers only work in black and white, some models can also produce color prints.  Because of their speed and economy, laser printers have largely replaced all other types of printers except ink jet and thermal printers.

'''Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL; CD30+)'''

==Overview==
*T-cell or null-cell lymphoma, defined by membrane expression of CD30+
*First identified in 1985, added to REAL classification in 1994
*Represents ~5% of NHL in adults and ~15% of NHL in children
*Clinical subtypes (see below)
**Systemic
**Primary cutaneous


==Systemic ALCL Overview==
*Pathologic subtypes of systemic ALCL
**ALK+
***Predominately in young male patients
***Aggressive presentation (75% systemic symptoms, 60% extranodal, 30% BM+)
***Better prognosis (5-year OS 70-80%)
**ALK-
***Predominately in older patients
***Less aggressive presentation
***Worse prognosis (5-year OS 30-40%)
*No specific RT information available as yet
*Typically managed as [[Radiation_Oncology/NHL/Treatment_high_grade|Aggressive Lymphomas]]:
**CHOP is first line of treatment, CHOP-R if CD20+
**RT as per institutional preference
*Overall better prognosis than other Aggressive Lymphomas


==Cuteneous ALCL Overview==
*Accounts for 25-30% of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas
*Spectrum of diseases including lymphomatoid papulosis and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma
*Lymphomatoid papulosis 
**Indolent lymphoproliferative disorder
**Typically multifocal
**Frequently recurrent, but resolves spontaneously without treatment over weeks to months
*Cutaneous CD30+ ALCL
**Indolent lymphoma
**Typically solitary or localized group of nodules and/or satellite papules. Localized is considered by the Dutch (see below) to be 1 anatomic area not exceeding 15 x 15 cm
**Spontaneous regression sometimes occurs, but frequently relapse
**Typically ALK- (unlike the systemic manifestation)
**Favorable prognosis, with 10-year DFS &gt;90%
**Treatment is usually localized RT or surgical excision, but evidence is lacking


*'''Yale; 2008''' (2001-2006) PMID 18037577 -- &quot;Treatment of primary cutaneous CD30+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma with radiation therapy.&quot; (Yu JB, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Apr 1;70(5):1542-5. Epub 2007 Nov 26.)
**Retrospective. 8 patients. Localized C-ALCL, no other history, N0, treatment with RT alone. Median age 67, M=F. RT 40/20 (34 - 44 Gy), using 6-9 MeV with 0.5-2cm bolus. Median F/U 12 months
**Outcome: 100% CR
**Toxicity: Grade 1-2 dermatitis
**Conclusion: RT alone for localized C-ALCL is well tolerated and clinical response is excellent. Longer follow-up necessary

*'''Stanford; 2003''' PMID 14639383 -- &quot;CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders: the Stanford experience in lymphomatoid papulosis and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma.&quot; (Liu HL, J Am Acad Dermatol. 2003 Dec;49(6):1049-58.)
**Retrospective. 56 patients with CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (LyP n=31, PC-ALCL n=25). Treatment for PC-ALCL excision, RT, chemotherapy or combination. RT dose not specified
**Outcome: 10-year DFS LyP 92%, PC-ALCL 85%; 5-year DFS localized PC-ALCL 91% vs generalized 50% (NS). Highly responsive to treatment, but relapse rate 42%. Progression to extracutaneous 3 patients
**Conclusion: Overall excellent prognosis, but cases with poor outcome exist

*'''Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma Group; 2000''' PMID 10845893 -- &quot;Primary and secondary cutaneous CD30(+) lymphoproliferative disorders: a report from the Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma Group on the long-term follow-up data of 219 patients and guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.&quot; (Bekkenk MW, Blood. 2000 Jun 15;95(12):3653-61.)
**Retrospective. 219 patients, primary or secondary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders. Lymphomatoid papulosis (Group 1, n=118); primary C-ALCL (Group 2, n=79); C-ALCL with regional LN+ (Group 3, n=11); secondary (extensive cutaneous and extracutaneous) C-ALCL (Group 4, n=11). RT dose not specified
**Treatment: LyP often no treatment. Skin limited Group 1-2 treated with RT or excision, and if treated with chemo, all had relapse. 
**Outcome: 10-year risk for systemic disease Group 1 4%, Group 2 16%, Group 3 20%. 5-year DFS 100%, 96%, 91%, 24%
**Conclusion: Favorable prognosis. Chemotherapy only for developing/existing extracutaneous disease

*'''EORTC; 1995''' PMID 7751878 -- &quot;CD30/Ki-1-positive lymphoproliferative disorders of the skin--clinicopathologic correlation and statistical analysis of 86 cases: a multicentric study from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Cutaneous Lymphoma Project Group.&quot; (Paulli M, J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jun;13(6):1343-54.)
**Retrospective. 92 cases reviewed by expert panel. 
**Prognosis: favorable - age &lt;60, spontaneous regression; unfavorable - age &gt;60, extracutaneous disease
**Conclusion: CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders are a spectrum of closely related skin lesions

*'''European Multicenter; 1993''' PMID 8382999 -- &quot;Primary cutaneous CD30-positive large cell lymphoma: definition of a new type of cutaneous lymphoma with a favorable prognosis. A European Multicenter Study of 47 patients.&quot; (Beljaards RC, Cancer. 1993 Mar 15;71(6):2097-104.)
**Consensus report for definition. 47 patients from 5 center analyzed. 
**Features: solitary or localized skin lesions, partial/complete spontaneous remission of skin lesions (~25%), frequent cutaneous relapse (~30%). Extracutaneous disease developed in 25%
**Outcome: favorable prognosis. DFS 77%, death from disease 9%

name=Densaugeo|
type=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic#Spells|Spell]] (Jinx)|
features=Causes extreme growth|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]|}}

== Overview ==

'''''Densaugeo''''' apparently causes the teeth of whomever it hits to grow rapidly.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] uses it first in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 18|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]; he had goaded [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] into dueling with him. The spell hit Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Furnunculus|Furnunculus]] jinx and ricocheted, hitting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] in the mouth. As a result of this, Hermione's front teeth grew to a length of over a foot long.

== Analysis ==

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]], we learn that combining jinxes can have unexpected effects. We can't be certain that the extreme growth of teeth was the intended effect; the spell may well have been modified by hitting the Furnunculus spell. Additionally, as this spell does not seem to be used elsewhere, it is hard to know what its normal effect would be. We can't even really tell whether the spell would cause growth of whatever it hit, or is specific to teeth; the word used seems to be related to teeth (&quot;dens&quot; from the French &quot;dents&quot;, &quot;augeo&quot; from the same root as &quot;augment&quot;), but without another example of the spell in action, this must be purest speculation.

Given the apparent effect of this spell, it is hard to imagine what Draco's intent would be in casting it; the effect would seem more likely to enrage the victim, rather than incapacitate him, although one supposes that the lisp resulting from having teeth overlapping one's chin could render verbal spell-casting ineffective.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

While the spell and its use here seem almost pointlessly trivial, this is a demonstration of the fact that spells, like physical projectiles, will be reflected by other spells. This proves to be a useful point at the climactic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|battle in the cemetery]] at the end of this book, and in battles in later books as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About this Unit==
From the [http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gceapplied/science.html AQA Specification]:

&lt;blockquote style='border: 1px solid blue; padding: 2em;'&gt;
In this unit you will learn about:
*the structure and function of the circulatory and respiratory systems including the processes involved in respiration;
*some methods of taking physiological measurements related to the circulatory and respiratory systems, and the uses of these in monitoring health and for diagnosis of illness;
*examples of imaging methods used in monitoring health and in diagnosis, the advantages and disadvantages of using these methods, and which are best suited to particular situations;
*ethical issues relating to the monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of the circulatory and respiratory systems;
*relating information from measurements or monitoring to what is happening in the organs and systems involved;
*some applications of energy transfer both in the body and in wider contexts;
*the meaning of the term ''efficiency'', how to calculate the efficiency of a system and know that there is a fundamental limit to efficiency.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==How you will be assessed==
In this unit you will be required to complete an external examination of 1½ hours duration. The examination will consist of a series of compulsory short answer questions and will be marked out of 80. The examination may also contain a comprehension exercise.

You will be assessed on your knowledge, understanding and skills relating to choosing and using materials.

==What you need to know==

== A nice cup of tea ==

Thanks for the comment. Actually, the original article, which didn't read like a recipe, was mostly my work (with, of course, a lot of help from George Orwell!). Someone replaced it with what you found. It was awful, wasn't it, but I didn't want to change it back because after all this is a collaborative site and if that's what people want ... If it isn't, someone else will come along and change it back. Which you've more than done. 

Your article looks OK to me but I'm less of a stickler for standardised formats than some of the people around here, and I also prefer more discursive articles to fixed recipes, giving people the basic knowledge to go out and discover things for themselves. I've never really got into green tea, for example, and on the basis of your comments, may give it another go.  [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] ([[User talk:Redlentil|talk]]) 08:54, 25 May 2008 (UTC)

== [[Bartending]] and {{tlx|delete}} ==

Your cleanup work is looking great; thanks for the help. When you use {{tlx|delete}}, please keep the reason short (a few words) and don't add your sig. Thanks. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:17, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

First, thank you for helping me clean up all that stuff. I noticed in the logs you were the person doing all the grunt work. I was going to send you a thank you before logging off, but you beat me too it. :-) Especially think you for the [[Talk:Bartending/Alcohol/Wine]] merge help.

Secondly, sorry about going overboard on he delete comments. I don't know all the buzzwords for speedy delete here, so I figured it was better to just explain why it was an obvious SD even if it didn't ''exactly'' fit neatly into a specific SD policy (or perhaps fit into several). Since I contribute on several Foundation sites (mostly the English versions of Wikipedia, Commons, and once again here), it gets hard for me to remember every site's particular nuances when it comes to that sort of thing. I basically act boldly (but not recklessly) until someone slaps me for something, and then I try to learn. So, I will try to do better here and won't use my signature. Do you have suggested verbiage for the types of delete requests I have been making? In a big project like this, I kind of become a human bot, and just replicate my actions as much as possible to avoid burning out brain cells. Some stock request comments ''would'' make it easier than coming up with new ones each time. This will be even more important when I delve into the cruft littering the cocktail recipes area. And after all that is cleaned up, I will need some help transwikiing a lot of stuff over from Wikipedia into [[Bartending Guide]] here, and then linking the two sites together better. The second part should be easy, but the transwikiing part I'm still a little tentative on. Maybe I can ask for a little assistance from you when I get to that point? Thanks again! --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 17:30, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
:The default delete reasons are listed at [[MediaWiki:Deletereason-dropdown]] - anything there would be fine. For bringing stuff over from WP, you'll want to make a request at [[WB:RFI]] listing the pages you want transwikied. And you can always ask me or another admin if you get stuck. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:38, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
::Thanks for both pieces of info. As to [[Bartending/Alcohol/Vodka]] reading like a Wikipedia article... I'm not really into the cleanup and improvement phase yet. I'm just trying to get everything reorganized first. I noticed that [[Cookbook:Vodka]] was a double-redirect, so I pulled that one section out of the larger article. I tried massaging the info a bit to be a bit more narrative, but, yes, it still sucks. :-) I'm trying to formulate a more standard layout for the various articles, but until I see for sure what all is there, it's pretty hard. I thought there was a lot more bartending info, but mostly it looks like a Wikipedia dumping ground (which I already knew from being on the Wikipedia side where everyone else's mantra is &quot;Wikipedia is NOT a recipe book... dump it onto Wikibooks!&quot;). My goal is to change that. I want to get the Wikipedia articles to have good in-depth information about notable drinks, and I want a variety of classic and modern drinks that are typically ordered in bars to be listed here. Fill these articles with some fun factoids that bartenders could share with customers, a little history if it's significant, and some ''common'' variations (not every possible variation under the sun!), and tips on preparation and presentation. You know, the stuff a beginning bartender might want to know. All the rest of the cruft can be dumped on 1001cocktails.com or someplace that readily accepts every drink and variation known to man. Dunno if I will ever finish or not, but it's a goal. :-) It took me 3 months to get Wikipedia whipped into a lot better shape, and 1.5 years later, the effects are still visible (which makes me happy). I would appreciate it if you don't tag every article with a &quot;needs improvement&quot; badge, though. The whole dang book needs improvement, and that's what I'm trying to do. Once we get some decent articles, then we can start tagging the worst ones. Ok? :-) Also, I don't want this to remain a one-man show forever. Since the book has had basically no work done on it for months (except transwiki dumping), I figured it was time to rebuild the framework, and then once that's in place, try to drum up some help to improve and add content within that framework. That's what worked at Wikipedia, and hopefully it will work here, too. I still can't get over the radically slower pace around here, though. It's much more peaceful and comfortable here. I really like it! I'm just telling you all this so you understand my motivations and methods. I'm not a flake, though things are stirring in my offline life that may keep me away for a while (family health issues that could require a lot of back and forth distant travel). But once the real world settles down again, I'll pick right back up and keep on editing. I just want to get as much done as I can before I get called away. That's another reason I appreciate your help with the speedy deletes. Have a good weekend! --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 19:57, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
:::If you think cleanup tags aren't helpful, consider that the last :) I find it is helpful though when you have more than one person working as you can point and say &quot;There!&quot;
:::Generally we're much more laid-back here &amp; it's a tight-knit (small) community. I just couldn't work at Wikipedia, which is how I ended up here. Sorry to hear about that news; I hope everything works out for the best. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:41, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
:::: Right now, in that particular book, no... not really helpful. Once we get things sorted out, then yes. Do you use article assessments here like on Wikipedia? You know, where a page is stub, start, B, A, GA, FA, etc.? I know you have featured books, and since this is a book-oriented site, page-specific stuff might not usually be helpful. However, I think that for a sprawling project like this one, it would be helpful. If there isn't such a tool here, what do you think about me starting one? It would go on the talk pages, just like at Wikipedia--keeping it out of the main content. I could certainly keep it project-only, but if anyone else would find it useful, then maybe it should be offered to all and used by those who want it, and ignored by most everyone else. Anyway, I'm signing off for the day. TTFN.  --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 21:26, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
:::::No, we don't use assessments like that. Hopefully we will get FlaggedRevs soon (though there is a surprising lack of interest in it) which will be used for that sort of thing.

'''Graham crackers''' were originally conceived as a &quot;health food&quot; made from whole wheat (specifically, [[Cookbook:Graham Flour|Graham flour]]), but have since entered the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|cuisine of the USA]] as a basic [[Cookbook:Biscuit|biscuit]] often made from highly refined [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] with added [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]].

Graham crackers are often used as an easy source of whole wheat for a recipe, by crushing for use in baked foods. They are a bit similar to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|UK's]] digestive biscuits and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia's]] whole wheat biscuits, or &quot;wheatens&quot;.

'''Graham flour''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] made from [[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]] in accordance with the designs of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] religious minister [[w:Sylvester Graham|Sylvester Graham]]. It is a special variation of [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat flour]], made by mixing finely milled white flour with coarsely milled bran and wheatgerm, in the proportions that they would be found in a whole wheat berry.

Rather than simply grinding the whole grain wheat kernel (bran, germ, and endosperm), in graham flour the components are ground separately. The endosperm is ground finely, initially creating white flour. The bran and germ are ground coarsely. The two parts are then mixed back together, creating a coarse-textured flour that bakes and keeps well. Graham flour is used to make graham crackers and pie crusts, among other things.

Graham flour is not available in all countries. A fully correct substitute for it would be a mix of white flour, wheat bran, and wheat germ in the ratio found in whole wheat. Wheat comprises approximately 83% endosperm, 14.5% bran, and 2.5% germ by mass[1]. For sifted all-purpose white flour, wheat bran, and wheat germ having densities of 125, 50, and 80 grams/cup, respectively, one cup of graham flour is approximately equivalent to 84 g (~2/3 cup) white flour, 15 g (slightly less than 1/3 cup) wheat bran, and 2.5 g (1.5 teaspoons) wheat germ.

Plain whole wheat flour can also be used as a substitute in recipes, but the texture of the resulting baked goods will be different than if graham flour had been used.

Graham flour was the original flour used to make [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|Graham crackers]], but modern versions use highly refined flours and [[Cookbook:Sugar|cane sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] instead.

'''WikiProject Bartending''' oversees the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the '''[[Bartending|Wikibooks Bartending Guide]]'''. Anyone interested in the topic is encouraged to join the WikiProject. You don't have to join to edit the Guide, but we find it helpful to work together to accomplish more and avoid wasting efforts.

On April 12, 2006, some [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]s formed a [[Wikibooks:WikiProject|project]] currently known as the '''[[w:WP:MIX|WikiProject Mixed Drinks]]'''. The goal of the Project is to better organize information in articles related to both alcoholic and non-alcoholic '''mixed drinks''' and the '''drinkware''' associated with such beverages. On January 25, 2007, the WikiProject was expanded to WikiBooks as the ''Bartending WikiProject''. The goal is much the same as on Wikipedia, but focusing on continued development and enhancement of the [[Bartending|''Wikibooks Bartending Guide'']] and transwiki coordination between the two peer WikiProjects.

This page and its various sub-pages contain many goals, guidelines, suggestions, and observations made by Project Participants and others interested in bartending. '''You do not have to be a professional bartender or a skilled mixologist to participate or edit the ''Bartending Guide''. It is hoped that this Project will help to focus the efforts of other editors as we all work to improve and expand the Wikibooks and its sister projects. For more information on WikiProjects in general, please refer to [[Wikibooks:WikiProject]], [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject|Wikipedia:WikiProject]], and [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject best practices|Wikipedia:WikiProject best practices]].

If this topic interests you, we would love your help. Add your name to the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending/Participants#List of participants|list of participants]], and introduce yourself on the [[Wikibooks talk:WikiProject Bartending/Participants|talk page]].

To help, whether you become a Participant or not, please see our [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending/To do|To-Do List]] for the list of things that Project Participants have identified as needing to be done. Thank you in advance for any assistance you provide in helping make Wikibooks a better place for everyone.

===New WikiProject===
:''Posted by [[User:Willscrlt|Willscrlt]] 14:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)''
In an effort to help improve communications between the English Wikipedia and the English WikiBooks on the related topics of mixed drinks and bartending, I have, in a manner of speaking, transwikied this WikiProject over from Wikipedia to here. It is not meant to replace or interfere with the fine work already in created by editors here, but to serve as a common place to plan, communicate, and share information back and forth. If you edit the Bartending Guide, please become a Project Participant.

==Scope==
This WikiProject strives to develop a comprehensive Bartending Guide, covering both the basics and the finer points of the bartending industry, including mixology. It is concerned with the occupational and practical applications of information, more than the collection of encyclopedic information found at Wikipedia.

===On-topic information===
* Topics related to the bartending profession that answer the basic &quot;Who?&quot;, &quot;What?&quot;, &quot;Where?&quot;, &quot;When?&quot;, &quot;How?&quot;, and &quot;How much?&quot; questions people interested in becoming bartenders are likely to ask.
* Job and customer service skills bartenders should know.
* Things related to mixed drinks (cocktails, liquors, beers, wines, non-alcoholic bar beverages, mixers, bar tools, drinkware, garnishes, supplies, etc.)
* Recipes for making all the standard mixed drinks patrons are likely to request (see the list of International Bartender Association [[w:IBA Official Cocktail|Official Cocktails]] for a minimum starting point).
* &quot;Tips from the trenches&quot; that experienced bartenders feel are important, but not always obvious, for novice and hobbiest bartenders to understand.
* Drinking culture and responsibilities of which bartenders should be aware.

===Off-target information===
* In-depth, encyclopedic information about specific topics (drinks, tools, drinkware, etc.), especially that focusing on the history of the drink; its significance and notability. A one to two paragraph synopsis of the background of the topic is generally adequate, and the Wikipedia article can be listed as an additional source of information.
* Biographies of bartenders and drinkers in general, unless they are short and illustrative or uniquely important to the history of bartending or a related topic. A table of prominent people could be added at the end of the article linking to Wikipedia biographies.
* Places, including specific bars, unless they are short and illustrative or uniquely important to the history of bartending or a related topic. A table of prominent places could be added at the end of the article linking to Wikipedia articles.
* [[w:Drinking game|Drinking game]]s, which are well-covered on Wikipedia.
* [[w:List of fictional beverages|Fictional beverages]] of any type, except to possibly alert bartenders that such drinks do not really exist.

===Priority===
The highest priority is given to general informational articles on the topics of mixed drinks and the various lists of mixed drinks the Project maintains. Secondary priority is given to highly notable drinks, such as the [[IBA Official Cocktail]]s, which are popular worldwide, along with the drinkware used with such drinks. Also at that priority are articles that do not focus on drinks directly, but expand into people and places notable for their contributions to or connections with mixed drinks. Third priority is given to less notable drinks, drinkware, people, and places. While at a relatively lower priority, the workload is high, because these articles usually require additional investigation to determine if there is enough information to justify an entire article, or if the article should be combined with another topic, only listed in passing on one of the mixed drink lists, or omitted entirely.

===Hierarchy===
{{main|Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending/Hierarchy}}

We use the following structure and hierarchy of pages within the [[Bartending]] book. It is our intention to keep the book wide, rather than deep. In other words, pages should rarely be more than three levels away from the root of the book ([[Bartending|Bartending/]]), and should never be deeper than five levels (Bartending/2/3/4/5). Module and page names should be as short as possible while still clearly communicating the topic. In many cases, the full name of the topic can be deduced easily from the full name (&quot;Bartending/Drinkware/Beer&quot; is preferred to &quot;Bartending/Drinkware/Beer glasses, mugs, and steins&quot;). The shorter names help both when typing names manually, and when locating articles from within categories.

Commonly used modules include [[Bartending/Alcohol]] (types of alcohol, not specific drinks), [[Bartending/Cocktails]] (alcoholic beverages), [[Bartending/Beverages]] (non-alcoholic beverages), [[Bartending/Drinkware]], [[Bartending/Equipment]], [[Bartending/Garnishes]], [[Bartending/Intro]], [[Bartending/Mixers]], [[Bartending/Reference]], and [[Bartending/Work]].

Please view the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending/Hierarchy#Hierarchy of Bartending modules|complete hierarchy of modules]] for suggestions on where to properly place various article topics within the hierarchy.

===Structure===
Ideally, each Project-related article should include much or all of the following information: one or more photographs representative of the drink; suggestions for when and how the drink is commonly enjoyed (e.g., special occasions, after work, at sporting events, etc.); popularity and distribution of the drink worldwide; interesting (sourced) bits of trivia related to the drink; a list of ingredients and briefly the methods used to properly prepare, mix, and serve the drinks; the origin and history of each drink, including the (sourced) creator and date of creation; the [[mixed drink supplies]] (including [[drinkware]]) used to prepare the drinks; and anything else (sourced) that enhances the reader's understanding of the drink.

===New pages===
Please feel free to list your new mixed drink or drinkware related pages here (newer articles at the ''top'', please).

* ''None listed at this time. Why not add one?''

==Projects==
&lt;!--This section is for organizing group projects--&gt;

Some Project Participants may enjoy working on special projects. One such special project is taking good-quality photographs (original works that are freely licensed) of the various drinks listed. Another special project is temporarily adopting one stub and becoming a [[Detective|super sleuth]], tracking down as much information as possible about a drink, writing a good article, and documenting all sources used within the article. See [[#Special Projects|Special Projects]] below for more information.

===Ongoing Projects===
{{message box|heading=This section needs updating!|message=This was copied directly from Wikipedia and needs to be edited to reflect the scope and goals here at WikiBooks. Please discuss changes on the talk page.}}

* Fill-in all sections of the [[Bartending]] Guide
* Cross-referencing cocktails, beer cocktails, and wine cocktails by liquor used as well as alphabetical by drink.
: Alphabetical lists are better handled by creating a category and tagging all related articles with the category tag. Manual lists have to be constantly maintained or the list becomes quickly outdated. Categories are self-generating. I see the same is already being done with some of the liquors. --[[User:Willscrlt|Willscrlt]] 04:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
* Creating a useful list of reference guides.

===Special Projects===
The following names are informal, but designed to be fun. You can participate in any or all of the projects. If you like, you can add the special project designation after your name in the [[#Participants|Participants list]] above.
* '''BUILDER''': Construct a usable Infobox template, other templates, userboxes, etc. for use by the Project and its Participants.
* '''CATEGORIZER''': Tag all Project articles with appropriate tags so the articles are listed in the appropriate categories.
* '''DETECTIVE''': Temporarily adopting one stub or creating a new article and becoming a [[Detective|super sleuth]], tracking down as much information as possible about a drink, writing a good article, and documenting all sources used within the article. Of course, everyone else can still edit an adopted article, and you can work on other things too, but the idea is to find a focus for a while, to try and build up the number of quality articles the Project has produced.
* '''IDENTIFIER''': Tag all Project articles' ''talk'' pages with the Project banner. Tag articles that do not meet the Project's standards for length and quality as stubs. Tag unreferenced statements for follow-up by Project Detectives.
* '''PHOTOGRAPHER''': Take good-quality photographs (original works that are GFDL licensed) of the various drinks listed.
* '''RENAMER''': Rename all project articles to match the type of mixed drink: '''Name (cocktail)''' (which includes cocktail shooters; must be made primarily with ''distilled'' alcohols), '''Name (mixed drink)''' (which includes cocktail-like drinks that are not made primarily with distilled alcohols), and '''Name (beverage)''' (for non-alcoholic drinks and soft drink mixers).

==Resources==

===Infoboxes===
''Coming soon''

===Userboxes===
''Coming soon''

===Templates===
Special [[WikiBooks:WikiProject Bartending/Templates|templates]] will soon be created for use by Project Participants and other Wikipedians.

===Thank You!===
Thank you for adding your name to the list of people helping to improve the [[Bartending|WikiBooks Bartending Guide]]. No matter how little or much you help, every edit that improves WikiBooks is appreciated and helps lighten the workload of the other editors. More importantly, it improves the quality and breadth of the English WikiBooks and its sister projects.

There are no special rules, regulations, or commitments required to join this WikiProject as a Participant, other than the policies and guidelines that apply to all editors. This is because a WikiProject is not a club or membership organization. It is a group of people interested in a particular topic that agree to work together within the WikiBooks framework to improve modules. The WikiProject helps to focus the activities of the group to improve efficiency. You are not required to work a certain amount of time, but obviously the more time you can offer, the faster the Project will meet its goals.

Feel free to add any [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending#Special Projects|special project]] designations and special interests after your name. If you are involved with mixed drinks professionally (bartender, bar owner, food and beverage manager, etc.), please indicate that, too.

After adding your name, please introduce yourself on the [[Wikibooks talk:WikiProject Bartending|Participants talk page]].

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.57}}

In this module, we'll take a closer look at the User Preferences window.  In the process, you'll encounter three different user-interface controls: radio buttons, toggle buttons, and sliders.

==Saving User Preferences==
Most other applications have a place to keep user-configured settings (including document defaults), separate from any actual documents the user creates. Blender works in a slightly different fashion: all your user-configured settings are saved in ''every'' document you create. Each time you create a new Blender document, it actually just reloads your ''default'' document, which is called &lt;TT&gt;.B.blend&lt;/TT&gt;. To save your current state as the default document, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|U}}. This will save ''everything'' you’ve done to the current in-memory document, including objects and materials created, to &lt;TT&gt;.B.blend&lt;/TT&gt;.

==Accessing the User Preferences==

First we must open the User Preferences window. There are 3 ways to do this:&lt;br /&gt;
* Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} ''File &amp;rarr; User Preferences...''
* Change the window type of the top header to ''User Preferences'' [[File:Blender269UserPrefsIcon.png]] and drag the header down.&lt;br /&gt;
* Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|U}}, which will open the User Preferences into a separate window which you can resize at will.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The User Preferences window should look something like the screenshot below.
{{B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Blender-2.5_user_preferences.png
|imageWidth=800px
}}

==Configuring Your Preferences==

So as to get to modeling and rendering sooner, this tutorial will cover only a few of the many preferences which you can set.

===Auto Save===
Auto Save is a very useful feature that automatically saves the current .blend after a specified period of time. The settings are:&lt;br /&gt;
* ''Auto Save Temporary Files'': This enables/disables the auto save feature.&lt;br /&gt;
* ''Timer (mins) slider'': This specifies the time in minutes between each auto save.
{{B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Blender-2.5_user_preferences_files.png
|imageWidth=800px
}}

===Number of Undo Levels===

Next we'll look at the undo settings. By default, Blender remembers your last 32 actions and allows you to undo them one at a time by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Zkey}}. If your computer has plenty of memory, you may wish to increase that number.  If it has relatively little memory, you might consider decreasing it to 10 or 20. The ''Memory Limit'' slider specifies the amount of RAM (in megabytes) to use for storing the undo levels. Undo level &quot;0&quot; is unlimited.

{{B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Blender-2.5_user_preferences_editing.png
|imageWidth=800px
}}

===Numpad Emulation===

Blender uses numberpad keys (such as {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num7}}) to control the 3D View and ordinary numeral keys (such as {{B3D:N2P/Do|7Key}}) to change layers. If you are working on a laptop or if you find the numberpad inconvenient, you can select ''Emulate Numpad'' to reassign the 3D View controls to the ordinary numeral keys.

{{B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Blender-2.5_user_preferences_input.png
|imageWidth=800px
}}


If you ever need to restore Blender to its factory settings, you can either delete your personal &quot;.blend&quot; file and then restart Blender or click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} ''File &amp;rarr; Load Factory Settings''
{{B3D:N2P/Note|The second method only affects the current session.  To make the settings persist, you would need to save them with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|U}} or ''File &amp;rarr; Save User Settings'' - This menu name has been changed to ''Save Startup File'' in Blender 2.67b.}}

* [[../Non-standard equipment|The tutorial on Non-standard Equipment]] describes other workarounds for numpad issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Using Auto Gordian Knot to Encode a DVD to an xvid file===

====Requirements====

Auto Gordian Knot Full Package - http://www.autogk.me.uk/modules.php?name=Downloads

Xvid codec - http://www.koepi.org/xvid.shtml [download and install latest stable binary]

Ac3 codec - http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Codec-Packs-Video-Codecs/AC3-ACM-Decompressor.shtml

====Method====

Put a DVD in your DVD drive. 

Open Auto Gordian Knot 

Step One. 

[[Image:Open_ifo_agk.jpg]]


Open the IFO file of your DVD this is a small file which has information about which of the data VOB files to open to encode. There may be more than one on your DVD. If the DVD is one long film it is likely that the IFO file you want will be called something like xx_01_0.IFO . If you are not sure you can use the Preview button to check you have the correct film from the DVD 


Step Two

[[Image:Audiosubs_agk.jpg]]

1) If your DVD has more than one language audio on it you should choose the appropriate one from the list. 

2) You can also include subtitle tracks in the end avi file too. If you want to do that select a language from the list. 


Step Three

[[Image:Settings_agk.jpg]]

1) Select how big you want the end file to be. There are three ways of doing this we are going to select the Custom file size option. 

2) If it is a full 90 minute film then select 700MB. 
If you have a 10 minute film then select 100M - a guideline of 8-10 M per minute should give good results. 

3) Then click on Add Job. 

4) Now click Start. 

This will probably take a long time. Encoding is quite intense on your computer's abilities so don't be surprised if it is an overnight job for a full film.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bird Song==
&lt;center&gt;''The view of the brain as a tabula rasa, a blank slate, all too long a basis for the thinking of learning theorists, is patently absurd'' -- Peter Marler, 1996&lt;/center&gt;

Birds communicate information about danger, food, sex, group movements and many other purposes via acoutic signals. A subset of these have been termed '''song''', as they frequently feature with extended, tonal, melodic characteristics. The Zebra Finch's song, for instance, includes several introductory notes followed by a string of syllables within an extended melodious pattern. Sonograms (i.e., a plot of the intensity of pitch against time) are commonly used as a primary tool for studying and comparing bird songs. 

Respiratory muscles force streams of air from large air sacs through the bronchi. Membranes in the syrinx vibrate as air expressed from bronchi passes over them. Syrinx muscles for left and right sound producing structures can act independently, and many birds are able to sing harmonies with themselves.
Song appears to play a role in advertising for sex  and species recognition as song complexity frequently coincides with the presence of ornate plumage. It also stimulates and synchronizes courtship behavior, stimulates reproductive readiness in females, and contributes to pair bond maintenance. Local song dialects exist in many species.

Successful song in most adult male songbirds depends on memorizing the calls of a conspecific tutor during an earlier, sensitive phase in life. The appropriate song repertoire is acquired in a series of distinct stages. Young birds, during an early '''Sensory Phase''', listen to a conspecific tutor and thereby obtain information about the characteristics of its own song. Only a very specific subset of surrounding songs is actually accepted as suitable, suggesting the presence of an in-built song template. Following this sensory phase, young birds actively begin to vocalize themselves. Their '''Subsong''' is an atonal, noisy, meaningless repetition of sounds, which lacks recognizable syllables. Akin to human ''Babbling'' birds practice coordinated movements of the respiratory system, sound producing organs, and related structures (e.g., tongue). During '''Sensory-motor Phase''', young birds spontaneously produce ''Plastic Song'', consisting of vocalizations with distinct syllables and recognizable elements. Such &quot;work in progress&quot; will include elements from the song of tutors and elaborate them into a variety of syllables and phrases that even exceed what eventually will be used in its adult song. The ability to hear its own vocalizations are critical for normal development. In transition to the '''Mature phase''', birds adopt a ''Crystallized Song'' with syllables and syntax structure that is characteristic of its species. Once established, these song patterns remain fixed in many species, are no more disrupted by deafening, and are presented intact during each subsequent breeding season. In contrast open-ended learners (e.g. starlings and canaries) retain the capacity to adjust or alter their song throughout life.

Song production is under the control of multiple hormonal systems from embryonic gonads. Injections of testosterone induce adult males to sing, even out of season, while similar injections in females have no such effect. The presence of estrogen during male development appears to be essential. When estrogen is blocked experimentally in developing males, testosterone injections fail to elicit song. However, when estrogen had been delivered to developing females, injection of testosterone elicited song in them &lt;ref&gt;Konishi M. 1989. Birdsong for Neurobiologists. Neuron 3: 541-549&lt;/ref&gt;.

Several neural centers with a role in song have been identified. The ''Higher Vocal Center'' ('''HVc''') is a group of neurons in the forebrain that is larger in (singing) males than in (non-singing) females. Damage to it blocks song production in adults. The ''nucleus of the archistriatum'' ('''RA''') in males is larger than in females and its neurons increase in size and dendritic arborization during song learning. Damage to this area blocks song production in adults. The ''lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum'' ('''LMAN''') is neither sexually dimorphic nor shows seasonal change in neuron size or number. Its ablation in young birds interferes with song acquisition but its ablation in adults brings about few deficits as long as song had already been been learned prior to damage. Area X of the paraolfactory lobe ('''Area X''') is sexually dimorphic and new neurons are added in song learning. Damage to it interferes with song acquisition in young birds but not in adults.

===Zebra Finch Song and Tinbergen's Four Aims===
As in every behavioral system, a series of independent questions can be addressed for song behavior in Zebra finches (''Taeniopygia guttata'').

'''Proximate Causation''': Zebra finch song production requires the flow of air through semi-independent vibrators in syrinx and vocal tract. The presence of song, and song repertoire size are reflected in sexual dimorphism of its controlling brain areas and nuclei. A ''learning pathway'' esists separate of a ''motor pathway''. Singing, which is largely restricted to males, is under the control of androgens.

'''Ultimate Causation''': Song in Zebra finches is a learned vocalization used during courtship and defense of a territory. Advertising the individual's presence it serves to elicit mating opportunities from females and to stimulate the partner's reproductive behavior and physiology. Moreover, it functions to claim a territory and to repel competitors from it.

'''Phylogeny''': Virtually all 9000 species of birds have the ability to vocalize, including crows, turkeys, owls or nightingales. A large subset of them, including the zebra finch, are characterized by complex vocal organs, distinctive brain circuitry for song, and acquisition of species-characteristic vocalizations through learning. Taxonomically these are all restricted to a single order - the Passeriformes.

'''Ontogeny''': The emergence of adult zebra finch song illustrates the interactions of genetic and environmental factors in behavioral development. After periods of listening to the songs of tutors, starting its own partial vocalizations, rehearsing and adaptating its own song, the species-specific adult version slowly emerges. Song circuits exhibit extensive plasticity even in adults with ongoing neurogenesis and seasonal changes in neuronal morphology.

===White-crowned Sparrows===
White-crowned sparrows (''Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli'') males sing a single song that shows considerable geographic variation in the form of '''stable dialects'''. Bilingual and blended strategies exist at the boundaries. The distinctiveness of the song depends on patterns of natal dispersal and the timing of learning. Subject to reinforcement by the song of neighbors, the system is highly dependent on auditory feedback. The work by Peter Marler, Doug Nelson and others for over 30 years illustrates how genetic and environmental factors interact during the development of a complex communication system. Males generally establish territories during late plastic song with a repertoire that consists of ~4 different songs. Improvisations yield individual-specific songs which closely match that of the nearest rival.
	
'''Cross-fostering experiments''' illustrate the role of auditory templates in song learning. Young birds reared in the presence of taped song will learn and present that song, even if the tape came from another species. A Song sparrow raised with a swamp sparrow tape will experience little difficulty to learn the swamp sparrow song. Birds in '''Isolation experiments''' are raised without access to intact adult song (i.e., no template) and will subsequently show deficiencies in their own song upon maturation. The song does nonetheless contain valid elements of intact adult song. Moreover, '''Deafening experiments''', which deafen birds at hatching, results in song that still contains some valid elements but is an even cruder version than those of isolated birds. When '''Song preference experiments''' present young birds with a wide range of conspecific and heterospecific songs, they recognize and preferentially learn the song of its own species. Birds raised in '''Mixed syllables experiments''' in the presence of a mixture of swamp- and song sparrow syllables, will accurately produce these syllables in their song but lack the normal adult syntax.

'''Castration Experiments''' have shed light on the roles of hormones in song learning. Swamp sparrows that are castrated early in development have low testosterone levels compared to their male siblings. They acquire song but progress to plastic phase only. Treating such birds with injections of testosterone ('''Enhanced Testosterone Experiment''') immediately crystallizes the song. Interfering with testosterone function in adult birds ('''Reduced Testosterone Experiment''') degrades previously crystallized song back to plastic.

===Brown-headed Cowbirds===
Brown-headed cowbirds (''Molothrus ater'') are gregarious birds that follows cattle herds. Brood parasites that are raised by parents of different species, no consistent, conspecific tutor available. So, how do they learn their own conspecific song? One of the strongest stimuli is the bird's own crystallized song and feedback from females is important (i.e., action-based learning). {{Animal Behavior stub}}

==Human Language==
Humans show exceptional skill to communicate with fellow conspecific using verbal and gestural symbols. Such competence is arguably one of mankind's greatest assets as well as a key to most of our species' achievements. It brings us together with our peers and enriches us through an exchange of experiences, thoughts and value systems. It endows us with the means to acquire skills for situations that we may have never personally encountered before. A staggering range of regionally  distinct languages and dialects, grouped in larger language families, not only serves as a system of communcation but also tags us for membership within a specific group. In addition to bringing us together, it has thereby been at the heart of an ancient source of division. Although few things in biology ever group cleanly into one of the nature vs. nurture extremes, this particular division seems to be purely cultural. Regardless of the specific race, ethnic or regional group that we happen to have joined through birth, we all are able to acquire competence in any human language. In particular, we seem to acquire our '''native language''' without formal education, long before many of our intellectual capabilities have mnatured, and simply by immersion into the particular language environment of parents and relatives during the first few years of our life. The scientific study of the nature and structure of languages is called '''linguistics'''.

===Universal Grammar===
BF Skinner suggested that infants learn language through a process described as operant conditioning&lt;ref&gt;Skinner BF. 1957. Verbal Behavior. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt;, namely, via the monitoring and management of reward contingencies. Skinner's position would be that a four-term contingency analysis comprised of motivating operations, discriminative stimuli, responses and reinforcing stimuli would be the means by which behavior could be explained. In children and infants this process would be expanded by what he called &quot;shaping&quot;, &quot;prompting&quot; and other stimuli modeling, imitation and reinforcing procedures. Language acquisition then is a process that would take thousands of instances of such training, and this appears largely to be what takes place. Critics who do not understand the inductive power of this approach largely assert that this view now &quot;appears quite simplistic.&quot; However, this argument to complexity is not dissimilar to arguments against Darwin's theory of natural selection. How could the amazing complexity of the animal kingdom come about through such a simple means? Surely, we would need something more complex to explain the variety of animals? Darwin's theory of selection is now accepted as such a means, despite it's &quot;apparent simplicity&quot;. Similarly the mechanism of operant conditioning can be seen as sufficient to account for very complex forms of behavior in a wide variety of circumstances without appealing to unproven, non-data driven speculative theoretical approaches like those of Noam Chomsky and others.

Language learning is clearly the most complex task any of us will ever undertake. Yet, the process appears to be considerably less painfull than acquiring an understanding of calculus, or organic chemistry. Noam Chomsky has long argued that this paradox is best explained by the view that humans, and in particular children, have innate abilities that support the acquisition of a language&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky N. 1975. Reflections of Language. New York: Pantheon Books&lt;/ref&gt;. It is clear that we seem to be naturally good at it, especially before we reach puberty. Moreover, we appear to have a natural need to fill our world with language; in the absence of formal language tutoring a form of language structure develops anyway. Some say a specialized language faculty seems to aid in this process, one that includes innately specified constraints on what forms are possible. These innate, language-specific, information processing mechanisms may be encapsulated in language module of the brain. However, these innate faculties are inferred, hypothesized explanations with no foundation in fact. No biological location has been found for them, no genetic location, no brain structure. It is all inference.


All human languages, even spontaneous ones, show many common principles of language acquisition as well as rules of grammar. The concept of '''universal grammar''' proposes that this is due to a set of innate rules, which guide how we acquire language and how we construct valid sentences in it. It thus attempts to explain language in general, and not simply describe the construction of any one specific language ''per se''.

There are many alternative theories of human language consistency besides the speculative theory of &quot;universal grammer&quot;. One theory is that human environments possess common structures and human language simply responds to the commonality of the world. Universal grammar is a speculative, unproven hypothesis that is still awaiting confirmation and has no evidence to support it other than &quot;rational argument&quot;.

===Language Acquisition===
At very young age, we acquire our native language by listening to, guessing at the meaning of, and imitating the symbols used by tutors around us. Moreover, during these early years we learn to walk and talk without any explicit need for understanding how we are doing what we are doing. In this process we seem to be helped by a set of Inherent learning strategies, the ability for optimized pattern perception of common, ambient symbols. 

Infants are exceptionally broad in their abilities to perceive sound qualities. In fact, as infants we can distinguish many more language sounds than we can as adults. During the first year of life, infant brains are actively engaged in optimizing acoustic perception for the language sounds that surround them. Such early acquisition of information about native language depends on perceptually mapping both the critical aspects of language, and statistical properties of speech.

It is now clear that infants perceive the various phonetic units, track the frequency of different formants, and extract the boundaries of words from running speech. Patricia Kuhl suggests that language acquisition is based on a combination of factors to provide a powerful discovery procedure for language&lt;ref&gt;Kuhl P. 2000. A new view of language acquisition. PNAS 97(22): 11850–11857&lt;/ref&gt;. Evidence suggests that '''initial perception parses speech in a universal way''' in all human infants. Infants have inherent perceptual biases that segment phonetic units without providing innate descriptions of them. They were able to parse and discriminate a wide range of basic phonetic units. Adults, in contrast, are only able to discriminated phonetic units that occur in their first language, but fail to distinguish those that are not used there. Japanese adults, for example, fail to discriminate phonetic boundaries of ''r'' vs. ''l'', boundaries that do not exist in Japanese. Such discrimination is based on general auditory processing mechanisms, rather than on innate phonetic feature detectors for speech. Language learning requires '''mapping these probabilistic patterns into language strategies'''. As infants detect frequency patterns in language input they identify higher-order units. Infants thus discover the critical parameters and phonetic dimensions of the sounds used in their native language. Sensory processing becomes optimized by experience for enhance perception of the specific language around them. '''Vocal learning unifies language perception and production''' where vocal learning depends on a comparison of one's own vocalizations to those of others. Imitation forms the integral bond between the perception and production of language abilities and together they become optimized for the first language. If a second language is learned later on, it will carry the accent typical for the speech motor patterns of their primary language, even following long-term instruction. Similarities in infant-directed speaking styles (increased pitch and exaggerated stress) enhances language learning by assisting infants in discriminating phonetic units, as well as by capturing attention.

===Brain Areas===
'''Broca's Area''' underlies the ability to produce speech, but it is not critical for understanding language. Patients with damage will fail to form words properly, and speech is halting and slurred. '''Wermicke's Area''' is essential for the ability to understand language. Patients with damage to this area can speak clearly, but the words make no sense (i.e., word salad). The '''Arcuate Fasciculus''' connects these two areas. Damage to this connection causes conduction aphasia where language is understood, but neither can words be repeated, nor does own speech make any sense. Capabilities for speech are not distributed evenly across the two halfs of the brain. Speech is only disrupted when amobarbital is selectively used to anesthetize only the half of the brain which contains these speech centers. Imaging techniques (e.g. fMRI) have identified that bilingual individuals utilize an overlapping set of neurons in the language areas for these two languages. In contrast, individuals who have acquired a second language later in life will likely rely on separate neuronal areas in these speech centers. Late bilingual speakers are also less likely to show strong lateralization of speech function. This suggests that as two language systems are learned together early on, they can share the same brain centers without causing catastrophic interference. In adult learning, the best sites of brain real estate have already been taken up by the first language, thus, any new language learning must co-opt 'new' territory adjacent to it or on the other half of the brain.

The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics or MWI, also known as the relative state formulation, theory of the universal wavefunction, many-universes interpretation, Oxford interpretation or just many worlds, is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that claims to resolve all the &quot;paradoxes&quot; of quantum theory by allowing every possible outcome to every event to define or exist in its own &quot;history&quot; or &quot;world&quot;, via the mechanism of quantum decoherence, instead of wavefunction collapse. Many worlds reconciles how we can perceive non-deterministic events (such as the random decay of a radioactive atom) with the deterministic equations of quantum physics; history, which prior to many worlds had been viewed as a single &quot;world-line&quot;, is rather a many-branched tree where every possible branch of history is realised. MWI was first theorized in a dissertation by Hugh Everett which was initially rejected by Neils Bohr but gradually gained acceptance with the encouragement of Everett's thesis advisor John Wheeler.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Included Content ==

Beginner readers are not expected to have explored much of the storyline.  They are presumed to have read a large part of at least one of The Lord of the Rings books or The Hobbit.  Pages marked for Beginners contain short synopses of the book plots, introductions to some key characters in the series and overviews of several important locations.

== Excluded Content == 

Much of The Lord of the Rings has not yet been explored.  Much of the character list and all of the chapter summaries are beyond Beginner level.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Included Content == 

Intermediate readers should know much of The Lord of the Rings' storyline.  The reader wishes to expand on that with analysis and commentary.  Most sections are open to Intermediate readers.

== Excluded Content == 

Intermediate readers can view most things.  Most content is covered and all that is left is filling in the gaps.  Intermediate readers should be knowledgeable about topics covered in the books but need not be able to grasp the Greater Picture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The prologue includes the incarnation, that the Word (Christ) really did become flesh and assumed a bodily form disuniting the earthly Jesus from the heavenly Christ.  The Word became flesh for a reason (so that we could become children of God) and He made his dwelling in us.  The consequence for us is that we have the fullness of grace and He has given us blessings and gifts one after another.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This report contains one line per supplier. It lists:
*Supplier Number
*Supplier Name
*Prepaid Amount
*Overdue Amount
*Period 1 Amount
*Period 2 Amount
*Period 3 Amount

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Curry-Howard ==
I'm running out of steam here. I'm not sure I know enough to write the last two sections, and this article lacks a sense of direction at the moment. I think it needs to be either more expansive, mentioning other structures like Functors and how they correspond, or perhaps more detailed, formalising the concept of the isomorphism and mentioning e.g. that the preservation theorem of a reasonable type system guarantees that a logic system is consistent (i.e. only theorems can be derived from theorems). Anyway, if anyone wants to take this one up, feel free. [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 21:48, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

:This chapter is going pretty good and I also like the denotational semantics chapter.  Please keep at it.  It may be possible to suck in some stuff from the Wikipedia article [[w:Combinator]] which explains stuff like the T-transformation.    The section is a lot more understandable than [[w:Curry-Howard]] and again maybe some cross-importing could help both articles.  I'm new to this stuff so I don't think I can contribute anything myself, but it's helping me learn.  [[User:64.160.39.153|64.160.39.153]] 05:04, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

It would be nice to get rid of phrases like &quot;Firstly, we know the two axioms to be theorems&quot; - unfortunately, I am not a specialist in this area, and I don't know what the author means, but probably not this.
[[User:Vlad Patryshev|Vlad Patryshev]] 02:29, 3 May 2007 (UTC)


While the very broad and very narrow issues have been tackled, as a new comer to this topic, I see no narrative connection to &quot;isomorphism&quot;. Sure other forms of morphisms have been covered, but I am totally lost when it came to finding the meaning of the title. It's application and importance are perhaps hidden and in plain sight for an experienced logician, but I can't. I hope this important topic gets some serious attention. Forget about examples until isomorphism has been explained in more than one way.
: On first approximation, &quot;isomorphism&quot; is a synonym for &quot;equivalence&quot;.
: More precisely, the term &quot;isomorphism&quot; refers to a mapping that shows the equivalence of two mathematical structures. In this case, the Curry-Howard-Isomorphism is the mapping that assigns a proposition to each type such that that the products of types is mapped to the logical &quot;and&quot;, function types are mapped to the logical implication and disjoint sums (&lt;code&gt;Either&lt;/code&gt;) are mapped to the logical &quot;or&quot;.

== Fixed point combinator ==
What about 
 fix :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a
Doesn’t the existance of this function mean that the type (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a is inhabited, which can be used to prove any theorem? I guess it has something to do with recursion, but it should be mentioned. --[[User:Nomeata|Nomeata]] 21:14, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

:That's true, &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; represent an inconsistent theorem. But &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; is a primitive, every recursive function can be expressed in terms of it. Thus, you can remove it from the language.
:In other words, the Curry-Howards-Isomorphism only applies to languages like the simply typed lambda calculus that don't have general recursion.
:-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 12:06, 30 December 2009 (UTC)

== Polymorphic types ==
I'm become confused early on in the article because it says there is no such thing as a function with type a -&gt; b, yet this type is seen all the time for functions in Haskell. It says we can only talk about this in the context of some concrete types, but I don't really see how that's true with polymorphism. Given how common it is to see a -&gt; b functions in Haskell, could someone edit the article to clarify why that isn't applicable here? Maybe in the system describing the isomorphism there is no such thing as polymorphic types?

: It becomes clear when explicitly writing down the implicit universal quantifiers: a-&gt;b here means &lt;code&gt;forall a,b . a-&gt;b &lt;/code&gt; i.e. with the standard mathematical notation &lt;math&gt;\forall a,\!b.\ a \to b&lt;/math&gt;. A function of that type would be able to convert an arbitrary type a to any other type b you'd like to, essentially casting types which is impossible. In the Curry-Howard isomorphism, this type would correspond to a theorem &quot;from all propositions a, we can deduce any proposition b&quot; which is impossible, too.
: One the other hand, every function like &lt;code&gt;foo :: Char -&gt; Int&lt;/code&gt; is of course an instance of this type-scheme, i.e. there is a substitution &lt;code&gt;a=Char, b=Int&lt;/code&gt; that unifies &lt;code&gt;a-&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Char -&gt; Int&lt;/code&gt;. This means that we can use &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; as an argument to a function like
: &lt;code&gt;map :: forall a,b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]&lt;/code&gt;
: Note that &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; doesn't take an argument of type &lt;code&gt;forall a,b. a-&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, that would give it some type like
: &lt;code&gt;map :: forall a',b'. (forall a,b. a-&gt;b) -&gt; [a'] -&gt; [b']&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;br&gt;
: In conclusion: there is no function of type &lt;code&gt;forall a,b. a-&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; but many (all) functions are of the form &lt;code&gt;a-&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; for some ''concrete'' a and b. Does that answer your question?
: &lt;br&gt;
: Arguably, it's the job of the chapter [[Haskell/Polymorphism]] to detail &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; and stuff. Hm, maybe one should name it &quot;Polymorphism Basics&quot; or &quot;System F&quot;, maybe &quot;Haskell type system explained&quot;. It's pretty much a prerequisite to the Curry-Howard isomorphism or Existential types. Ah, and the Curry Howard chapter needs polishing, too. Meanwhile, there's a tutorial [http://www.thenewsh.com/~newsham/formal/curryhoward/] by Tim Newsham (but I'm not sure whether using the special &lt;code&gt;Prop&lt;/code&gt; type constructor is a good idea).

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is common for two or more countries to commemorate an event or famous person at the same time by the issue of a stamp.

To accommodate this we will try to co-ordinate the numbering of the stamps when this has occurred.  In order to accomplish this we are reserving certain numbers for this purpose.  These will be in the range between xxx-yyyy-11nn and xxx-yyyy-19nn, where &quot;xxx&quot; represents the country code, &quot;yyyy&quot; represents the year, and &quot;nn&quot; represents the numbers for the stamps in that set.  For a variety of reasons it may not be possible to co-ordinate the numbering of the stamps within a given set, but it will be attempted where it practical to do so.

In general, these functions do simple table maintenance or parameter modification on supporting tables and parameters documented in Data Tables and Parameters.  Since the functions are so straightforward, they are not documented any further.

*Modify Parameters
*Maintain Supplier Type
*Maintain Terms
*Maintain FOB
*Maintain Ship Via
*Maintain Hold Type

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some parameters and data tables are used by every module.  These are maintained by Systems Administration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{DSP Page}}

There are a number of different mappings from the analog domain to the digital domain, and vice versa. All mappings must satisfy the following rules:

#Stability must be preserved in both domains. This means that the interior of the unit circle in the digital domain must correspond to the left-half plane in the analog plane.
#The mapping must be one-to-one. every point in one domain must correspond to a unique point in the other domain. This relationship should hold both ways.

The relationship between the analog and digital domains is highly nonlinear, and there is no way to perfectly reproduce an analog filter in a digital system, or to reproduce a digital filter in an analog system. However, it is possible to faithfully reproduce (within a certain tolerance) the magnitude response of the filter. It is rarely possible to reproduce the phase response of a filter across the transformation, however.</text>

== Introduction ==
Python includes several modules for manipulating xml.


== xml.sax.handler ==
[http://docs.python.org/lib/module-xml.sax.handler.html Python Doc]
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import xml.sax.handler as saxhandler
import xml.sax as saxparser

class MyReport:
    def __init__(self):
        self.Y = 1


class MyCH(saxhandler.ContentHandler):
    def __init__(self, report):
        self.X = 1
        self.report = report

    def startDocument(self):
        print 'startDocument'

    def startElement(self, name, attrs):
        print 'Element:', name

report = MyReport()          #for future use
ch = MyCH(report)

xml = &quot;&quot;&quot;\
&lt;collection&gt;
  &lt;comic title=\&quot;Sandman\&quot; number='62'&gt;
     &lt;writer&gt;Neil Gaiman&lt;/writer&gt;
     &lt;penciller pages='1-9,18-24'&gt;Glyn Dillon&lt;/penciller&gt;
     &lt;penciller pages=&quot;10-17&quot;&gt;Charles Vess&lt;/penciller&gt;
  &lt;/comic&gt;
&lt;/collection&gt;
&quot;&quot;&quot;

print xml

saxparser.parseString(xml, ch)
&lt;/source&gt;

== xml.dom.minidom ==
An example of doing RSS feed parsing with DOM

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from xml.dom import minidom as dom
import urllib2

def fetchPage(url):
    a = urllib2.urlopen(url)
    return ''.join(a.readlines())

def extract(page):
    a = dom.parseString(page)
    item = a.getElementsByTagName('item')
    for i in item:
        if i.hasChildNodes() == True:
            t = i.getElementsByTagName('title')[0].firstChild.wholeText
            l = i.getElementsByTagName('link')[0].firstChild.wholeText
            d = i.getElementsByTagName('description')[0].firstChild.wholeText
            print t, l, d

if __name__=='__main__':
    page = fetchPage(&quot;http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot&quot;)
    extract(page)
&lt;/source&gt;

The mathematical technique known as '''least squares''' can be used to design digital filters. This method works by creating the polynomial (transfer function) that is the &quot;best fit&quot; to a set of desired data (magnitude response).</text>

Most knight moves would lose a pawn - but [[/5. Nd5/]] prevents this and grabs at the centre. White can also play [[/5. Qb3/]] - which is the recommended move.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A place where ERP information is stored.  Data tables consists of one or more records each of which has one or more fields.  Each record has a unique primary key consisting of one or more fields. There can be several other keys as well.  Some tables are used throughout the ERP; others are specific to one module. Some tables such as those that store the Accounts Receivable invoices are large, complex and constantly changing.  Others such as the one that stores the enterprise's Accounts Receivable terms have only a few records with only a few fields and change only rarely. There are hundreds of small tables like these.  Most of these small tables are managed by the Maintain Module Information function. Contrast with Parameter.

&quot;Records&quot; are sometimes referred to as &quot;rows&quot; and &quot;fields&quot; are sometimes referred to as &quot;columns&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== CPU part picture ==

I was thinking to create a picture about the main component inside the CPU plus its connection to memory. It would contain the data bus, address bus, arithmetic unit plus program counter and so on. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 02:32, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

== Something's wrong with endianness! ==

The error I'm pointing out is so common that I've always been completely unable to clearly know the difference between each endianness. I mean, it's clear that the in-memory representation of multi-byte data on a LE computer will look reversed when compared with a BE computer; however, the definition given here (as well as in every other reference document I've consulted) is equivalent for both cases, so one of the definitions must be wrong.
To put this issue clear, according to the definitions given:
''Computers that order data with the '' '''''LS byte in the lowest address''''' '' are known as &quot;Little Endian&quot;, and computers that order the data with the '' '''''MS byte in the highest address''''' '' are known as &quot;Big Endian&quot;.''
let's look at what would be putting each machine at the lowest address: the Little Endian machine is putting, as explicitly stated in the definition, the LS byte. For the Big Endian machine, a bit of reasoning is required: it's putting the MS byte in the highest address, so on the opposite (lowest) address it'd be putting the opposite (LS) byte. Hence both machines are puting the LS byte in the lowest address? Something's wrong here. I'd like to fix that myself, but since this error is so common (that thing that is wrong here is, unfortunately, wrong almost everywhere), I don't know which would be the right definition and which the one that has to be fixed.

Suggestion to the author (or to who decides to fix it): make a table showing the storing of a 16-byte (or larger) value in the memory for each case, so ambiguity would completely disappear. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;
0x------34: MS: 00110011 (0x33)
0x------35: LS: 10101010 (0xAA)
&lt;/pre&gt;
The actual data would be 0011 0011 1010 1010 (0x33AA), while interpreted in the other endianness (which one is this and which is the other??) would be 1010 1010 0011 0011 (0xAA33). If somebody can tell me if this example is either Little or Big endian I could fix the article myself (and even add some examples). Actually, since this example doesn't put either the ''LS byte in the lowest address'' nor the ''MS byte in the highest address'', it wouldn't be any endianness according to the current definition.

[[User:Herenvardo|Herenvardo]] 20:32, 23 September 2007 (UTC)

Yes, too many people are confused by this.
I hope you and I can write something that will eliminate the confusion.
Your example.
        increasing address ---- &gt;
        0x33(MSB)  0xAA(LSB)
to represent 0x33AA is big-endian -- the &quot;big end&quot; (MSB) comes first.

Allow me to quote
&quot;ON HOLY WARS AND A PLEA FOR PEACE&quot; by Danny Cohen 1980
[http://david.carybros.com/html/endian_faq.html]:

: The first  word  in  memory  is  designated  as  W0,  by  both  regimes.
: Unfortunately, the harmony goes no further.

: The Little-Endians assign B0 to the LSB of the words and B31 is the MSB.
: The Big-Endians do just the opposite, B0 is the MSB and B31 is the LSB.

It all focuses on which end comes first.
Computers that put the least-significant byte in the lowest (&quot;first&quot;) address are little-endian.
Computers that put the most-significant byte in the lowest (&quot;first&quot;) address are big-endian.

I've added a little more explanation to the module.
Does it make sense?
Does it conform to Cohen's definition?
Please do edit that section to make it easier to understand.
Certainly we need to say it several different ways -- because too many people are confused, and just saying it once isn't enough to un-confuse them -- but also avoid making it sound more complicated and confusing than it really is.

== &quot;RISC and CISC and DSP&quot; section  ==

I've added another external link to where Phil Koopman's &quot;Stack Machines&quot; book can be read (or downloaded) online at no cost. Please note that he retains copyright &amp; asks people to not pass on their copy but instead refer them to his website. Also, the book has been little changed since 1989, unlike it's subject. Phil's attention has moved on to other subjects, mostly robust OS security.

One reason I added this link is that Jeff Fox, the creator of the Ultratechnology website used in the previous link, died in 2011. I recall some discussion on comp.lang.forth about hosting his website. website.http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.forth/browse_thread/thread/622263caccba35b5/a1f9671f53b8cf78?lnk=gst&amp;q=%22Jeff+Fox%22#a1f9671f53b8cf78
According to this, Jeff's lease on the Ultratechnology domain name will run out on May 12th, 2012 &amp; unless the complang.forth can solve the problem link 2 will no longer work. 

With another link it's less likely both won't work before someone can replace them.

== Von Neuman, Harvard &amp; Princeton Architectures.  ==

Are Harvard &amp; Princeton architectures 2 different types of Von Neumann architecture (as I suspect) , 
or 
are they 3 different architectures?, 
or 
is Princeton Architecture an impure Harvard Architecture ? 

As I've found in my own writing, we really need better ways of illustrating the hierarchy of categories than size &amp; boldness of text &amp; scored lines. 

Also we have to be very careful making statements about the history of ideas;- eg. was Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, (chiefly conceived but unbuilt by him, partly? built by others), a Von Neumann architecture machine? John nee Janos Von wasn't conceived at that point in time!

[[../Process|Previous | Production Process Overview]]

==Development==
Honestly how many different ways can one put an idea on paper?  Scripting is scripting no matter what the recording medium is.  DV may tend to use more AV side-by-side style scripting over the classical movie script, but other than that the conception stage is not where the differences lie.

That being said, solid development and planning leads to a superior final product.  The script is the absolute bare rock foundation for a project.  A bad script can ruin even the best production while even the best script can not save a bad production.  Like a damaged seed will create a damaged plant, a bad script will create a damaged film.  Evaluating a script for quality and production feasibility is the skill and art of a Producer.

To help filmmakers create scripts easier do not use Microsoft Word.  Formatting and all that mess is a '''major''' hassle.  There are a variety of great pay for software programs out there that will format a script to industry standards.  The following options are presented in alphabetical order:
*[http://www.celtx.com/ Celtx].
*[http://www.finaldraft.com/ Final Draft].  This is the program I ([[user:film8ker]]) but really that’s only because I had a friend that shared it with me.  It’s very easy to use and works well.  The new [http://www.finaldraft.com/products/final-draft-av/ Final Draft AV] looks very promising and I hope to get it soon.
*[http://store.write-bros.com/Default.aspx Movie Magic].  Some people swear that they will never use another program and other people hate it and will never touch it.  Personally I think it’s just as functional as the other programs, however if you pay the extra money to buy Movie Magic Budgeting, Movie Magic Scheduler, and Movie Magic Contracts, the products work well as a package.
*[http://www.page2stage.com/index.htm Page2Stage].  '''It’s now FREE!'''  Other than that it looks comparable to Final Draft.  You have to have a torrent client to download it, but you can’t beat legally Free!

Hello, Welcome to wikibooks!

I see that you've already joined our fledgling [[WB:CVU|Counter-Vandalism Unit]], and you've already helped with some vandalism. Thanks! My name is [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]], and I'm an active wikibookian, and a bureaucrat here on en.wikibooks. If you need any thing, or if you have any questions, please feel free to send me a message [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:47, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

== IP Vandal == 

I blocked that IP address for 1 week, I dont have time tody to clean up his mess. If you tag the things that need to be deleted, I will take care of it later. Thanks for the heads up. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:38, 30 September 2006 (UTC)
== Hi ==
Good to have some more help on RC stuff thanks (&amp; you seem to be around when I'n not!).  I notice your monobook.js has some interesting stuff in - mind if I take a look/test drive?  Feel free to browse mine tho I'll be updating the editor to WikiEd fairly soon I think. Equally did AWB work at all - something I've been meaning to try out?  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:21, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

As a ps - noting the spam project box, feel free to delve in my history - WB has a '''very''' different approach to ELs compared to WP - could look at [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Who_are_the_final_arbiters_of_Wikibooks_content]] --H

:Great to come on in the morning for me and find the place clean - thanks a lot for the help.  I looked at your .js but on wp I preferred Nav popups and they are working well for me here.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:07, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

::Ah, didn't realise that.  I would not be without them, saves going to the page so often - trouble is I expect it to work with conventional web links &lt;g&gt;.  This place is a little short of active &quot;staff&quot; users to do housekeeping type stuff so stick around - there is plenty to do!  What timezone are u BTW, I'm UK based - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:16, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

Spell checking is neat too! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:36, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

== In case you miss it! ==
Take a look at this maybe [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#BOTM_and_COTM.2C_december]], I'm sure you could help tho I realise that you may be busy which is fine - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:37, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

== AWB ==
Maybe should look at planning any &quot;runs&quot; so that we cover different places and try and cover all the cleanups needed?  My pet peeve is the absence of alpha cats around tho I'm working on them.  Equally loads of pages lacks cats. Not around for a bit but catch you sometime - Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:16, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
:I'd tried AWB earlier in the day and got nowhere then realised that I had an old version.  I'd forgotten how useful it was - and there are plenty of uncat'd pages in Wikibooks, never mind alpha cat'd!  Have you managed to get the spelling bit to work - it gave me a message about not finding the file and I could see anything in the default.xml about changing the file location?  As to the staff lounge stuff I guess I looked on you as &quot;staff&quot; in the sense that you appear interested in the whole project not just one topic (my definition only in case anyone gets upset!).  I now have quite a number of general pages (VfD, vandalism, RfA, etc) on my watch list.  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:59, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

::When you do get back - typos should work with AWB now! Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:40, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

== Mumfum!! ==
Big thanks for the work - appreciated --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:16, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
:I'm at work &lt;g&gt; so can't really deal with it for a bit (put a note on both vandal and another admin page tho).  I did have fun &quot;finding&quot; your talk page tho - had me worried for a bit.  The triple move idea is a bugger to deal with - I got in a tangle yesterday with one.  The decision making one looks like fun! The help you give is very welcome --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:05, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

::Well you did have fun - lunchtime for me and a chance to wander with the broom.  Pretty much head to head conflict there looking at the trail (I got so irritated by a similar one I self nom'd for admin!).  I think I've caught the bits that the others didn't catch and I did find one of the missing pages, just don't ask me how.  Again thanks it was good work, Wikibooks owes you --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:22, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

:more than welcome - another vandal fighting admin would be more than welcome by me - BTW would you be adverse to having checkuser run on you - Johnny and I feel that it perhaps should be part of any RFA type thing (hence our on checkuser request).

Congratulations, you are now a sysop. I would recommend you give a quick read-through to [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me or any other current admins.

== Your monobook ==

Az, I noticed on your [[User:Az1568/monobook.js|monobook]] that you include every javascript manually. You may want to consider a shortened function to do it. So your first script could look like the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
function winc(s) {
document.write('&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;' 
             + 'http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=' + s
             + '&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript&amp;dontcountme=s&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;');
}

winc('User:MarkS/extraeditbuttons.js'); // Script from [[User:MarkS/extraeditbuttons.js]] extra edit buttons
&lt;/pre&gt;
And the rest of your funcitons would just be a list afterwards. Your Rollback functions one would have to be done manually, tho, since it is on Wikibooks. Just a thought. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 23:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to Chapter 4==

In chapter 4, the Baptism introduces the reader to a prominent theme of Wisdom (water) throughout John. First, Jesus reveals himself to a Samaritan woman at the well, which is remarkable since Samaritan women were regarded by Jews as impure.  Therefore, Jews were forbidden to drink from any vessel they had handled.  In addition, for Jesus to share a drinking vessel with the Samaritan woman was considered unclean and very dramatic.  

At the end of chapter 4, Jesus returns to the territory around Cana where he’ll work his second sign by curing a Royal official’s son simply by his word.  Jesus told the official to go home and his son would live.  The man believed and on arriving home found his son well and that he had been healed at the hour when Jesus spoke his words.  This sign may be one of the most vital and significant to us. It shows us that although Jesus is not physically present with us he is able to be spiritually with us.  The significance for us is that Jesus is adoni of life.  Also, these two revelations are meant to show that Jesus’ mission is to all people. 



An important factor to consider before looking at the chapter is the relationship between the people of Judea and the people of Samaria. 

The Samaritans also looked down on the Jews as unclean. When Joshuah entered the land he halted between two mountains Ebal and Gerizim. Ebal was named the mountain of cursing and Gerizim the mountain of blessing. Where would you say they placed that ark? Yes that's what the Samaritan scriptures say Mt. Gerizim.  But the Hebrew scriptures inexplicably say Mt. Ebal. The Samaritans blame it on the wicked high priest Eli who they say usurped the priesthood and the ark. He also set up a counterfeit tabernacle at Shiloh. 

Some Samaritans had intermarried with Assyrians and thus the Jews despised them as traitors and idolaters. The Jews of Judea looked down upon the Samaritans for that reason, among others. 

The Samaritans also believe their Bible (the Pentateuch) is the pure one for it is written ion the ancient Hebrew. When the Jews returned from Babylon Ezra had rewritten the Hebrew scriptures from memory using new rounded letters. Jeremiah seems to agree with the Samaritans he wrote:

“How can you say that you are wise and that you know my laws? Look, the Word of Yah has been changed by dishonest scribes.”   (Jerm.8:8)

 There was great deal of animosity among the Judeans and the Samaritans, and often Judeans would not travel through Samaria to get to Galilee. While this might be an issue of personal safety, it is more likely a result of the utter disdain felt for Samaritans by the Judeans. Also, travelers in those times stayed with relations and friends while on the road, and it was not likely for Judeans to find either of those in Samaria.

This is the first glimpse in the book of John where someone who is not Jewish is promised the opportunity for eternal life. It shows that Jesus is not merely there for the Jews, but for all the peoples of earth who are willing to listen to his message. The Samaritan woman also speaks of the Christ coming, and Jesus reveals himself to her as the messiah. This is the first person he told he was the Messiah.

=John 4:1-42=


Verses 1-42 in Chapter 4 of John seems to point out a simple outline of evangelism through the example of Jesus.  Jesus has a definite direction toward which he influences this dialogue between himself and the Samaritan woman.  First of all, by asking for water, he engages in a conversation based on the context and circumstances of the moment.  In asking for a drink of water at a well, Jesus mirrors scenarios seen in Genesis 24, 1 Samuel 9:11, and 1 Kings 17:10.  The prophet Elijah also asked for a drink of water from the widow Zarephath while at at a well (1 Kings 17:10).  After establishing the event as biblical, Jesus begins to talk with the woman.  The odd part of this action is the woman's status.  She is not only a woman (a widow, or divorcee), but a Samaritan, a people which were generally looked down by the Jews as apostates and outcasts.  Jesus not only engages in conversation, but directs the topic toward spiritual matters, which serve as .  His direction is immediately shown by the mention of God and the metaphor of &quot;living water&quot; (v. 10).  Jesus offers a source of refreshment, life-giving water (the woman takes to mean literal flowing water).  The significance of living-water offered by Jesus is not obvious to the woman, she does not think of something more than physical water even after Jesus mentions in (v.10) 'the gift of God.' Third, Jesus tells her what he has to give her (v. 14), explained by the living water metaphor (wisdom)  which leads to eternal life.

  After a conversation about the differences in worship, Jesus points the woman the idea of one truth.  The author of the gospel is directly contrasting the earlier conversation with Nicodemus with Jesus' conversation with the woman at the well.  Irony, interestingly, plays a role as a Samaritan woman grasps who and what Jesus is while 'the learned teacher of Israel' is unable to do this. Living in a world full of pluralism, she seems to ask which way is the correct way to worship.  Jesus points out that her people by rejecting the prophets cannot know the way, but the Jews (who refused to live it) at least had preserved the wisdom that the prophets spoke. Salvation come from the Southern Kingdom of Judah. 

  Lastly, Jesus reveals himself as The Way, or The Messiah. This declaration is astounding. He finds a poor woman among outcasts who has a hunger to know God and he reveals himself to her first. That's why the poor are said to be rich in faith.

There is also some controversy as to who the Samaritan woman was.  The traditional reading of this text seems to be that the Samaritan woman was some sort of harlot, yet such was not necessarily the case.  As was mentioned before, the possibility exists that she had been divorced or widowed.  In the culture of Jesus' day the woman had no power over whether or not to divorce and it was always initiated by the husband.  If this was the case it is possible that Jesus was questioning her inability to maintain a husband, which would be shameful.  Also it could be that she had been widowed 5 times, which sounds absurd except for the fact that a story popular around that time outlined just such a scenario in which a woman was tormented by the deaths of multiple husbands.  Yet the man she was presently with was not her husband. If she was living in adultery she would have been stoned by the Samaritans, so the only answer is that she was in a  tryst with a single man.If read in this way it is possible that Jesus was actually sympathetic to her difficult past but not willing to overlook her current sinful state.  Whatever the case may be it is clear that this line of questioning was intended to show that Jesus had a 
 knowledge of the woman's situation and thus could speak to her directly.  It might also have been a continuation of a motif found elsewhere in John as well as in the Synoptic gospels, that of Jesus conversing and spending time with people who were seen as unclean or sinful by society. 

On a whole new level the Northern Kingdom with Samaria as its capital had become the center of Bull worship. Baal, the bull god's name means husband. 

Jesus says go call your husband. This woman may have been involved in 5 previous Baal cults and was with her sixth.
She  seems to not see any condemnation of her marital state but instead, responds as  a sincere truth seeker and admits she is not happy with her current Baal cult. Then she asks isn't the El that you Jews worship in Jerusalem the same bull god that we worship on our mountain?

Jesus amazes her by saying they are both wrong. Yah is worshiped in spirit, not in rituals, in temples, on mountains, with sacraments, priests, priestesses, sacrifices, baptisms, ceremonies, tithes and offering etc. It takes place in secret in your closet.
The kingdom comes without observation. You can't see it. You cannot go to it, it is in your heart.

 The use of spirit here show the weakness of the Greek language.  John 1:32 says, &quot;I saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him&quot;  refers to the angel. Worshiping in spirit means devoid of any externals. 

The idea of evangelism is continued once the disciples return from their hunt for food.  The Samaritan woman returns to her town and tells the people in the town about this man who knew her so well without ever having met her.  This act adds to the process of evangelism because Jesus has inspired the woman to also assist in spreading this good news (v. 28-29).  The disciples are then told that the &quot;Fields are ripe for harvest,&quot; as Jesus instructs them to evangelize also (v. 35).  He explains that &quot;One sows and another reaps,&quot; thus sharing the concept that the laborers - such as the fathers of the religion - had already paved the way.  Verses 39-42 explain the success of the evangelism in the numbers who believed. 
It is also important to not leave out verse 38 when analyzing these passages. Jesus states, &quot;I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.&quot; (NAS) Some believe that Jesus was referencing his own labor. Predicting that it is He who has &quot;labored&quot; or better yet will sacrifice his life and that he has sent you, the believers, to &quot;reap&quot; the benefits of his life with out laboring. In other words, Jesus did the work, and the believers could reap the benefits. For instance look back at verse 36 &quot;Already he who reaps is receiving wages, and is gathering fruit for life eternal; that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.&quot; (NAS) Those who &quot;reap&quot; these benefits are promised eternal life so that he who sows, Jesus, and he who reaps, believers, will &quot;rejoice together.&quot; (NAS)

The water and food metaphor are to show that though the flesh has needs, so does the spirit.  The parallel between water and food are in turn Jesus' ways of showing eternal life and the yearning to serve God.  The living water metaphor (see v. 10) shows the earthly mentality of the woman.  Water was something which she had to work for through the flesh in order to get for the flesh.  Jesus, however, gives her this water through his grace.  This brings us back to John 1:14 which foreshadows this grace.  Aside from grace, truth can be abrasive and hurtful.  The combined effort of Jesus' grace and truth are found when Jesus knew the truth about the Samaritan woman, and did not condemn her, but rather guided her in graciousness.

This passage emphasizes some important messages in the form of women and the idea of cultural crossover.   The fact that Jesus stops to talk with the Samaritan woman raises questions of Jesus' role and his mission.  &quot;In obvious respects it is parallel to the description of the Samaritan mission in Acts 8, which is an important transitional moment in the movement of the gospel preaching from Judaism to the broader world, (Smith 109).  Furthermore, the author as well gives the woman justice by showing a breakthrough in understanding Jesus.   This contradicts Nicodemus who did not understand Jesus.

This passage shows that God is the God of all people and not just the Jews.  When Jesus talks with the Samaritan woman and tells her that a time will come when it will not matter where people worship shows the reader that God loves all people and not just the Jews.  Also, this passage is important because of Jesus breaking two cultural norms for that time by talking to a Samaritan who also happened to be a woman.
==John 4:43-54==

'''Faith in Chapter 4'''  When Christ returns to Galilee and meets the man whose son is dying, He remarks, &quot;Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,&quot; Jesus told him, &quot;you will never believe.&quot; (Verse 48)  The NIV translation seems to suggest that Galileans as a people struggle with faith, but the non-prejudicial allusion here could be that ''humanity as a whole'' struggles with the concept.  Accuracy is also extremely important to this point, as 'you people' is one of the thousands of places in the Bible where precise translation is absolutely essential to the intended meaning of the text.

Jesus ministry thus far seems to have been the biggest benefit to the lower classes - to people who seem to have the biggest need.  His previous miracles had been visible to minimal people - particularly the servants at the wedding in Cana.  Even his conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well had been out of contextual norm due to His association with those viewed with a lesser tolerance.  However, knowledge about His identity spreads already, as pointed out by verse 45, which says, “They had seen all that He had done in Jerusalem.”  Jesus’ ministry turns now to others who have faith, such as the royal official in this section.  Despite Jesus’ claim that the people will not believe “unless (they) see miraculous signs” (v 48), the royal official shows faith in Jesus simply by “begging him to come and heal his son” (v 47).  The idea that a man would request Jesus to do something shows signs of faith that something good will come of His actions.


The Jewish Passover Feast (a festival) is mentioned in John 2:13 and 2:23.  In 2:23 it is noted that &quot;many people saw the miraculous signs he (Jesus) was doing and believed in his name&quot;.  Most likely, people from Galilee followed him to Jerusalem after his miracle in Cana (John 2:1-11) and then returned to Cana after the Passover Feast, as mentioned later (John 4:45).  After going through Samaria, Jesus returns to Galilee at the close of chapter 4 and it clearly states that they welcomed him on the basis that, &quot;they had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they had also been there(John 4:45)&quot;.  There is harmony in chronology of events here.

A '''tava''', also '''thava''', '''tawa''', '''tawah''', is a shallow [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] used widely in [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asian cooking]]. It has no sides, and is sometimes slightly concave, much like a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] that is nearly flat. It is usually quite sturdy, often cast iron, as it must retain and spread the heat evenly.

It is very commonly used to make the many types of [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] popular through South Asia, especially [[Cookbook:Chapati|chapati or roti]], as well as several other fried foods.</text>

      <comment>/* Enabling Membership in Web.config */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ASP.NET}}

= ASP.Net Membership Provider = 
As of ASP.Net Version 2.0 Microsoft has included a membership system, or Membership Provider, that can be easily integrated into any ASP.Net 2.0 web site that has a MSSql Database back-end.  The new system is not limited to just logins but also integrates role based authentication, and profiles and takes away much of the hassle of having to create your own system to do the same thing.

= First Steps: Setting Up The Database =
Since the new Membership system relies on a MSSql Database back-end the first step is to make the necessary additions/changes to your ''web.config'' file.

If you do not currently have a connection string entry to your MSSql database inside your ''web.config'' file please reference the ASP.Net Database section first before continuing on to this next step.

Assuming that you have your database connecting string properly entered into your ''web.config'' file we will now configure your database and add the appropriate tables, stored procedures, etc... that are required.  Fortunately Microsoft makes this fairly painless by providing a tool that will do the job for us!  The tool is called ''aspnet_regsql.exe'' and is found at the following path normally: ''C:\windows\microsoft.net\Framework\v2.0.xxxxx\aspnet_regsql.exe''.  After you start the ASP.Net SQL Server Setup Wizard click '''Next'''.  Select the option '''Configure SQL Server for application services''' from the next page, then click '''Next'''.  At this point the Wizard is asking you for the path/location of your MSSQL Database.  In the Server box type in the full path to the MSSQL server that you are using.  If the SQL server is located on the current machine then type localhost into the box.  If your server is located on a remote machine then you will most likely have to enter in a SQL authentication, unless you are using Windows Authentication.

Once you have all of the authentication information entered and you have selected the database that you wish to use from the drop down list click Next.  The next screen will simply give you a summary of the information you have selected showing you the name of the server and database that the Wizard will install the Membership schema information onto.  Click Next to install the Schema into your database.  If all goes well you should get a success screen and you may click Finish.

= Enabling Membership in Web.config =
After the database schema has been updated the next step is to modify our Web.config file and enable the Membership Provider.

First open up your Web.config file.  At the top of the page, or near the top, should be your Database Connection string that we entered in the Database section.  Note the name that this connection has, such as LocalSqlServer, or whatever you have named it.

Inside the &lt;System.Web&gt; section of the Web.config file we copy and paste the following piece of code:
&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;membership defaultProvider=&quot;CustomizedProvider&quot;&gt;
      &lt;providers&gt;
         &lt;add name=&quot;CustomizedProvider&quot;
              type=&quot;System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider&quot;  
              connectionStringName=&quot;YourSqlServerConnectionName&quot;
              applicationName=&quot;MyMembership&quot;
              minRequiredPasswordLength=&quot;5&quot;
              minRequiredNonalphanumericCharacters=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/providers&gt;
    &lt;/membership&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

Also inside the &lt;System.Web&gt; section of your Web.config file you will need to change your Authentication entry to look like the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
   &lt;authentication mode=&quot;Forms&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Assuming that your connection string is correct, that you installed the Membership Schema correct, and you copied, pasted, and modified the above code appropriately there shouldn't be much left before it will work.  So let's save our Web.config file and test it out.

= Creating A New User = 
The best way to test our system is to try creating a user.  Included in ASP.Net 2.0 are several Web Controls that should be in your Tool Box that are specifically designed for working with the Membership Provider.  So let's make a new Web Form in the root directory of our website.  Drag and drop and CreateUserWizard from the Tool Box onto your new page.  Save the page and then click the preview page button/load the page by hand in your web browser, then try filling in all the fields and making a new user.  If all goes as it should you should be displayed a User Created Successfully box in your browser.

=Logging in as Your New User=
Now that we can make users let's try logging in as our user.  In the Tool Box there is also a Login Control that we can drag and drop onto the same page we made earlier.  We will also want to add a LoginName Control so that after we are logged in we can verify who we are logged in as.  After you have added these controls to the page save the page and load it in your web browser once again.  Using the login box try to login using the account you made earlier.  If all goes well you should login and the LoginName Control will be displaying your user name.

=Overview Of Included Login/Authentication Related Controls=
'''Login''' - Standard User name &amp; Password login box.  The Login Control is very customizable.  When the login button is clicked the default action is to Post-Back the page and verify the users credentials.
&lt;br&gt;
'''LoginView''' - Allows you to show different content in a part of the page based upon whether the user is logged in or not logged in.  The LoginView can also be used to display different content to Users based upon the Roles they are in (whether the user has logged in or not).
&lt;br&gt;
'''PasswordRecovery''' - Provides users access to recover their own passwords.  Requires an answer to a password question.
&lt;br&gt;
'''LoginStatus''' - Shows the currently status of the user.  If the user is logged in then this control will display a Logout link.  If the user is not logged in the this user will display a Login link.
&lt;br&gt;
'''LoginName''' - Will display the user name of the currently logged in User.  If no user is logged in then it will display nothing.
&lt;br&gt;
'''CreateUserWizard''' - A wizard that helps you create a new user account.
&lt;br&gt;
'''ChangePassword''' - Change password Control that allows users to change their own passwords, requires that you enter the old password.</text>

==Announcing the project==

I am bringing on line this project, which I have recently been preparing and which will grow over coming days and weeks according to unfolding plans. Please refer to the contents page to see existing components and the course's structure and makeup (further explanations will follow as time permits). Contributions and comments are of course very welcome. I will add to or reformulate this page as the project progresses. Wish me luck! --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:10, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

==New page log==

The page log page is now [[../Pagelog|'''here''']].

==Latest news==

Only three weeks after starting the project, the first ten lessons have been completed together with many complementary pages and full development of almost the items in the Table of Contents. Work of the course is now sufficiently advanced to make it functional. Even I am amazed! The experiment has also shown that Wikibooks is a good platform for a production of this kind. There is still plenty more to do - the rest of the lessons, in particular. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 10:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

Oops! I got sidetracked after this &quot;experiment&quot; and have failed to continue developing the course since then. Apologies for that. I only just found out it was featured last year, thanks everyone who was responsible for that! --[[User:A R King|A R King]] ([[User talk:A R King|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/A R King|contribs]]) 09:20, 27 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

'''Flatbread''' is a type of bread that is cooked flat, typically on a flat pan or other flat surface. Flatbreads are featured in many different [[Cookbook:Cuisine|cuisines]] around the world, and can be made from a wide range of [[Cookbook:Cereal Grain|cereals]] and other starchy foods.

Some flatbreads are [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] before cooking (e.g., dosa), whilst others are just mixes of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]], [[Cookbook:Water|water]], and sometimes other ingredients (e.g., roti). The mixture can be a thin batter (e.g., appam) or a dough (e.g., pita).

Usually, flatbreads are cooked with a minimum of [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|oil or fat]] in the pan, ''if any''. This helps the flatbread to [[Cookbook:Steaming|steam]] on the pan, rather than [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] &amp;ndash; the water in the batter or dough becomes steam and cooks the flatbread from the inside.

Flatbreads can be eaten by tearing off a piece to eat, by rolling up other food inside (e.g. [[Cookbook:Aloo masala|masala dosa]], [[Cookbook:Döner kebab|döner kebab]], [[Cookbook:Burrito|burrito]]), or by folding around food. In many cultures, flatbreads are used as utensils, by tearing off a piece and using it like tweezers to pick up other food.

This cookbook has recipes for the following flatbreads:

= Development Tools =
Many ASP.NET developers use [[w:Microsoft|Microsoft]]'s Visual Studio to develop ASP.NET sites.  But there are less expensive and free alternatives as well.  Microsoft's Visual Web Developer Express Edition is free.  Web Matrix is useful in that it also provides a simplified version of the Internet Information Services (IIS), Microsoft's web server.  The version of IIS included with Web Matrix allows you to test locally hosted applications. Since January 2006 Microsoft has made available free Express Editions of Visual Studio, including Visual Web Developer, which uses the later ASP.NET 2.0, and also has the same local IIS (called Cassini).  All require in addition the appropriate .NET framework also available from Microsoft, and for development the appropriate .NET framework SDK as well.

It is also possible to develop ASP.NET web applications using open source tools, or even simple text editors like Notepad.

= Hosting =
While most ASP.NET web applications are hosted using Microsoft's [http://www.microsoft.com/iis IIS web server], the [http://www.mono-project.com Mono Project] provides a way to host ASP.NET projects on open source web servers such as [http://httpd.apache.org Apache].

= Languages =
An unusual feature of ASP.NET is that it supports more than one programming language.  There is, in fact, no language called &quot;ASP&quot; but rather a programming platform .  The two most popular languages for ASP.NET development are Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) and C# (pronounced &quot;C sharp&quot;).

= Approaches to Coding =
ASP.NET pages can include their VB.NET or C# code inline with the HTML/CSS.  We will explore this method of creating ASP.NET pages first.  But ASP.NET pages also offer the ability to greatly separate the logic of the web application from the presentation layer of the page.  In this latter style, the C# or VB.NET code is kept in a separate file (called a &quot;code-behind&quot; file).  Thus, ASP.NET pages using the code-behind method will actually contain two files:  one a fairly traditional HTML file and a second file containing the bulk of the page logic.

A significant advantage of using code behind is that the code behind file must be pre-compiled.  Pre-compiling the file allows it to execute faster and forces the person designing it to fix errors at compile-time, rather than run-time.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{miskito/Title| |Using the templates| |Layout|How}}

==Template basics==

Some elementary instructions for using the course's templates are provided for authors/contributors here. For further information about templates in Wikibooks, see the general Help pages.

===Templates without parameters===

Some templates require that certain ''parameters'' be specified. Before discussing these, let us look at the simplest templates to use: those which have no parameters.

Such a template is placed on the page simply by enclosing the name of the template in double curly braces:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{TEMPLATE NAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

All the templates specially developed for this course have names beginning with ''Miskito/'', so once we know that we can talk informally about those templates here by only mentioning the part after ''Miskito/''. For example, when we say &quot;Later&quot; we are actually referring to the template whose name is ''Miskito/Later''. Therefore we can say that the way to call up a Miskito course template is by writing the following:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Miskito/NAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Let's try one. If we place this on a page:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Miskito/Later}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

then this is what we shall get:
{{Miskito/Later}}

Notice that this is the template listed below (in the template index) as &quot;Later&quot;.

===One-parameter templates===

However, most of the course's templates have at least one parameter. A parameter is like a field, a place where we specify &quot;something&quot; when calling up a template, and that &quot;something&quot; is then incorporated into the way the template shows. We'll start with templates that just have one such parameter. The syntax is then as follows:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Miskito/NAME|PARAMETER}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Thus the parameter is placed after the name, with a pipe symbol (|) in between. An example of a template taking one parameter is &quot;Review_head&quot;. This template places a title bar at the beginning of a review exercise. The parameter represents the instructions to appear at the top of the exercise; whatever we write in the parameter position will appear as the instruction. So for example we can write:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Miskito/Review_head|Translate:}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

to produce:
{{Miskito/Review_head|Translate:}}

or

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Miskito/Review_head|Pretend that someone asks you the following
 questions. Pretend that you live in another village and answer the
 questions.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

to produce:
{{Miskito/Review_head|
Pretend that someone asks you the following questions. Pretend that you live in another village and answer the questions.
}}

In this case the way the template is formatted can be improved to make it more legible and easier to edit, by inserting a line break after the separator for convenience, and another one before the closing curly braces, as follows (this will make no difference to the final appearance on the page):

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Miskito/Review_head|
 Pretend that someone asks you the following questions. Pretend
 that you live in another village and answer the questions.
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

We can leave a parameter blank (i.e. specify &quot;nothing&quot; for a parameter) by putting either a blank space or a line break in the position corresponding to that parameter. So if we don't want to include any instructions in this template we may write either:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Miskito/Review_head| }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

or:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Miskito/Review_head|
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

These both produce:
{{Miskito/Review_head|
}}

Parameters can have many different functions; these are specific to each template, as we shall now see.

===Templates with two parameters===

When a template has two parameters, these are also separated by a pipe symbol:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Miskito/NAME|FIRST PARAMETER|SECOND PARAMETER}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

So for example:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Miskito/Related|Contents|Table of contents}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

specifies the &quot;related&quot; template, with &quot;Contents&quot; as first parameter and &quot;Table of contents&quot; as second parameter. Which gives this result:
{{Miskito/Related|Contents|Table of contents}}

Observe that this element says &quot;Table of contents&quot; (the second parameter) but has a link to the &quot;Contents&quot; page (actually &quot;Miskito/Contents&quot;, but referred to as &quot;Contents&quot; for short) - the first parameter. Here are two more examples of templates with two parameters:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Review|My name is John.|Nini John sa.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

gives this result:
{{miskito_review|My name is John.|Nini John sa.}}

and

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Generic_table|
 This is the heading.|
 This is a list of three numbers:
 
 *number one
 *number two
 *number three
 
 That's the end of the list.
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

produces:
{{miskito/Generic_table|
This is the heading.|
This is a list of three numbers:

*number one
*number two
*number three

That's the end of the list.
}}

===Templates with more than two parameters===

Other templates work in the same way, but there are more parameters, each with a defined function. Let us take one example: the &quot;lesson&quot; template which is used to insert a new lesson in the table of contents in the following format:
{{miskito/Lesson|1|Nini Mary sa|My name is Mary|
''is'' / ''this'' and ''that'' / ''the'' / ''a''
}}

This template has four parameters:

#lesson number
#lesson name
#translation of name
#list of sections

The example shown is written as follows:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Lesson|1|Nini Mary sa|My name is Mary|
 ''is'' / ''this'' and ''that'' / ''the'' / ''a''
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ASP.NET}}

= Basic Page Structure =
Besides the similarity that an ASP.NET page has with a standard HTML page you will notice a few extra features.  The first of these is the first line of the page, which includes a &quot;page directive&quot; with three attributes:

    &lt;%@ Page Language=&quot;VB&quot; %&gt;

If the page were coded in C#, the page directive would take this form:

    &lt;%@ Page Language=&quot;C#&quot; %&gt;

Page directives are used to specify settings that affect the entire ASP.NET page.  ASP.NET pages can be written in many different languages, so we must specify which is used for this page.  The debug attribute tells the IIS webserver (or any other webserver capable of understanding it) to print debug information after the bottom of our page.  The trace attribute tells IIS to print more detailed information about the execution of the page, including tracing variables.  Page directives are included using special delimiters:

    &lt;%@  %&gt;


The next thing you'll notice that sets this page apart from a regular HTML-based page is the script block immediately following the page directive:

    &lt;script runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
      ' ASP.NET page code goes here
      Sub Page_Load()

      End Sub
    &lt;/script&gt;

While script blocks themselves are not uncommon in web pages, this one is unusual because it contains the attribute runat=&quot;server&quot;.  This attribute is specific to ASP.NET and indicates that this script block will contain server-side code.  Within the script block, we see a few examples of Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) code structures.  The first is a comment.  Comments in Visual Basic are prefixed by an apostrophe.  Everything following the apostrophe will be ignored:

VB.NET

    ' this is a comment in VB.NET

C#

    // this is a comment in C#


There is no multi-line comment delimiter in VB.NET.  Each comment line must be prefixed with an apostrophe:

VB.NET

    ' this is a multiline comment
    ' in VB.NET

C#

    /* 
       this is a multiline comment
       in C#
    */
    
Beneath the first comment, we see the Page_Load() method:

      Sub Page_Load()
      End Sub

Methods (also known as &quot;subroutines&quot;, &quot;subs&quot;, or &quot;functions&quot;) are named blocks of code that can be executed by calling their name.  

* Subroutine - encapsulates code, but returns no value to the upstream caller.
* Function - encapsulates code, can return a value to the upstream caller.

The Page_Load() method is a special method that executes whenever the page is loaded in a browser.  Because this method is executed every time the page is loaded, it is a useful place to define variables and start many processes.  Within the Page_Load() subroutine, we can see a VB.NET If/Then structure:  

        If Page.IsPostBack Then
        End If

In C#, it looks like this:

        if (Page.IsPostback) {
        }

This conditional statement tests to see if the page is a &quot;postback&quot; page.  We will discuss the postback mechanism in more detail later.  For the time being, know that nothing in this block will execute the first time the page is loaded.  But it will execute if a submit button on the page has been pressed.  

Finally the script block concludes.  Notice that all the code we've discussed so far happens before the opening HTML tag of the page.  All of this code will be executed on the server before any of the page output is sent to the browser.   

The only thing out of the ordinary in the body of the page is the form tag.  Form tags are common in HTML, but this one contains the same runat=&quot;server&quot; attribute that we saw in the script tag.  This should be an indication to you that this tag, too, has a special significance in ASP.NET

= Defining &amp;amp; Displaying Variables =

Here's a fully functional ASP.NET page in both VB.NET and C#.  It demonstrates a few concepts that we will discuss below:  variable declaration, variable assignment, outputing variables, and using CSS to format output.
Here it is in VB.NET: 

 &lt;%@ Page Language=&quot;VB&quot; trace=&quot;false&quot; %&gt;
 &lt;script runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
   Sub Page_Load()  
       ' declare variables
       Dim strCarMake as String
       Dim strCarModel as String
       ' assign variables
       strCarMake = &quot;Mini&quot;
       strCarModel = &quot;Cooper&quot;
       ' set label text values
       lblCarMake.Text = strCarMake
       lblCarModel.Text = strCarModel
       If Page.IsPostBack
         ' postback code goes here
       End If
   End Sub
 &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
       .box001 {
           font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, verdana, sans-serif;
       }
     &lt;/style&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;form runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
           &lt;asp:label id=&quot;lblCarMake&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; cssclass=&quot;box001&quot;/&gt; 
           &lt;asp:label id=&quot;lblCarModel&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; cssclass=&quot;box001&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;/form&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;

And the same page in C#:

  &lt;%@ Page Language=&quot;C#&quot; trace=&quot;false&quot; %&gt;
  &lt;script runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
    void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e){
      // declare variables
      string strCarMake;
      string strCarModel;
      // assign variables
      strCarMake = &quot;Mini&quot;;
      strCarModel = &quot;Cooper&quot;;
      // set label text values
      lblCarMake.Text = strCarMake;
      lblCarModel.Text = strCarModel;
      if(Page.IsPostBack){
        // postback code goes here
      }
    }

           &lt;asp:label id=&quot;lblCarModel&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; cssclass=&quot;box001&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;/form&gt;
     &lt;/body&gt;
   &lt;/html&gt;


Save this page on your server as variable_test.aspx and load it in your browser.  You should see the following displayed:

  Mini Cooper

That's a lot of code to print out two words, but it demonstrates some useful concepts.  So let's take a closer look at it by examining each part separately.  We'll begin with the Page_Load() subroutine (or void method, in C# jargon).  Three important things happen in that block.  First we declare two variables.
In VB.NET:

  ' declare variables
  Dim strCarMake as String
  Dim strCarModel as String

And in C#:

  // declare variables
  string strCarMake;
  string strCarModel;

In VB.NET the keyword &quot;Dim&quot; is short for &quot;Dimension.&quot;  Using it indicates that we want to define the dimensions of a variable, which means we want to create a name for a variable and define its type. In C# we have to precede the name of the variable it's &quot;type&quot; (in our case - &quot;string&quot;), nothing else is needed (and don't forget semicolon at the end of the line). Our first variable is &quot;strCarMake.&quot;  Since we want to store text in this variable, we define it as a string (literally, a string of characters).  We do the same for strCarModel.  In both cases, we've chosen to prefix the variable name with a three-letter prefix indicating its type.  So, when we see strCarMake in our code, we know that strCarMake should contain a string.  This is a handy practice, but is not required (in C# it is, of course).

Declaring a variable means that memory is set aside for it and a name is associated with it so we can easily reference it later.  But we still haven't put anything into our variables.  In the next few lines we assign values to them.
In VB.NET:

  ' assign variables
  strCarMake = &quot;Mini&quot;
  strCarModel = &quot;Cooper&quot;

And in C#:

  // assign variables
  strCarMake = &quot;Mini&quot;;
  strCarModel = &quot;Cooper&quot;;

The equals sign is, here as in most programming languages, known as the &quot;assignment operator.&quot;  So, until we say differently, strCarMake will contain the string &quot;Mini&quot; and strCarModel will contain the string &quot;Cooper&quot;.

Now our variables are declared and assigned, but we need a way to display them on our page (this isn't always necessary, but it is in our example).  An easy way to echo the contents of our variables to the screen is by associating them with labels.  The following lines create two labels and assign their &quot;.Text&quot; attributes to be equal to our variables.  The prefix &quot;lbl&quot; is short for &quot;label&quot; and is optional, but useful.
VB.NET:

  ' set label text values
  lblCarMake.Text = strCarMake
  lblCarModel.Text = strCarModel

C#:

  // set label text values
  lblCarMake.Text = strCarMake;
  lblCarModel.Text = strCarModel;
 
Glance down into the body of the page, and you'll see where these labels are placed:

   &lt;asp:label id=&quot;lblCarMake&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; cssclass=&quot;box001&quot;/&gt; 
   &lt;asp:label id=&quot;lblCarModel&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; cssclass=&quot;box001&quot;/&gt; 

The above are examples of special HTML-ish tags called &quot;ASP Controls.&quot;  There are many types of ASP controls.  This type is called a &quot;label&quot;.  Think of labels as simple placeholders which you can programatically control.  The important thing to notice here is that the ID attribute of each label uses the same name we defined previously.  When the ASP.NET engine sees a label control, it uses the ID attribute to decide what to do with the label (in this case, what text should go in it).  We've already told it that lblCarMake should contain whatever strCarMake contains.  So the first label becomes &quot;Mini&quot;.  We've also told it that lblCarModel should contain whatever strCarModel contains.  So the second label is replaced by the string &quot;Cooper&quot;.

You'll notice that our &lt;asp:label&gt; has two other attributes.  One is called RUNAT, which is set to &quot;server&quot;.  This is a required attribute that lets ASP.NET know to process the label. The other attribute is CSSCLASS.  We can use this class to associate a CSS class with our label.  The CSS for this page is defined inside the HTML header:

     &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
       .box001 {
           font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, verdana, sans-serif;
       }
     &lt;/style&gt;

While CSS is beyond the scope of this book, you can probably tell easily enough that the style named &quot;box001&quot; has an attribute called &quot;font-family&quot; which tells any CSS-capable browser to display anything associated with &quot;box001&quot; in &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; (if that's available on the system), or verdana (ditto), or whatever is defined as the system's generic sans-serif font (if neither of the previous two exist).  

There are a few other things to notice about our example.  First, looking back at the top of the page, notice that our postback block is empty, except for a comment.
VB.NET:

       If Page.IsPostBack
         ' postback code goes here
       End If

C#:
       if(Page.IsPostBack){
         // postback code goes here
       }

For this page, everything happens on page load (which in C#, good coding habits require it to contain inside the parentheses the two parameters - &quot;object sender, EventArgs e&quot;).  We don't even have a submit button on the page, so there's no way to post anything.  We include the conditional statement just for completeness, in case we intend to expand the page later (which we will do).  

In the body of the page, notice that our &lt;asp:label&gt; tags are nested inside some special form tags which have the same RUNAT attribute:

       &lt;form runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
           &lt;asp:label id=&quot;lblCarMake&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; cssclass=&quot;box001&quot;/&gt; 
           &lt;asp:label id=&quot;lblCarModel&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; cssclass=&quot;box001&quot;/&gt; 
       &lt;/form&gt;

It seems redundant that both the &lt;form&gt; tag and the &lt;asp:label&gt; tag both contain the RUNAT attribute.  It is redundant.  Get used to that, too.

= Examining the Output Page =

If you view the page above in your browser and then choose to view the page's source code there, you'll notice some things common to server-side scripting languages and a few things specific to ASP.NET.  I've simplified the VALUE attribute of the INPUT tag for sake of formatting.  Where you see &quot;[...]&quot; below there will be a long, incomprehensible string of characters:

 &lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
       .box001 {
           font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, verdana, sans-serif;
       }
     &lt;/style&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;form name=&quot;_ctl0&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;simple_variable_test.aspx&quot; id=&quot;_ctl0&quot;&gt;
           &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;__VIEWSTATE&quot; value=&quot;[...]&quot; /&gt;
           &amp;lt;span id=&quot;lblCarMake&quot; class=&quot;box001&quot;&gt;Mini&amp;lt;/span&gt;
           &amp;lt;span id=&quot;lblCarModel&quot; class=&quot;box001&quot;&gt;Cooper&amp;lt;/span&gt; 
       &lt;/form&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;

A big perk, in terms of security and, for those proprietary projects, secrecy, is that server-side languages hide a lot of code from the browser.  When a web browser requests a page from the web server, the server examines the page.  If the server recognizes the page as one that needs to be processed by a server-side scripting engine, it hands the page off to that engine for processing.  The processing engine (here, ASP.NET) does its work and hands the page back to the webserver, which, in turn hands off the finished product to the browser.  The code you see above is all that the browser gets.  Note that all the ASP.NET-specific code is gone, though there are some indications that this is an ASP.NET page.

Web servers usually decide which pages go with which sort of processing engines based on their file-name extensions.  ASP.NET pages generally end in .aspx (though you can define most anything else by custom configurations of your web server).  PHP pages end in .php.  HTML pages generally end in .html or .htm.

Notice a few of the changes that happen once our page is processed.  The &lt;asp:label&gt; tags have turned into ordinary &amp;lt;span&gt; tags.  Their CSSCLASS attributes have become simple CLASS attributes.  Their ID attributes remain the same.  And the mysterious RUNAT attribute disappears entirely.  Our &lt;form&gt; tag is still here, though its RUNAT attribute is gone and several other attributes, common to form tags, have emerged.

Interestingly, along with our &amp;lt;span&gt; tags, a new &lt;input&gt; tag has been added the form.  Note that it's attribute is &quot;hidden&quot;.  Hidden input tags are used in web programming to carry the values of variables from one page to another.  If this form contained a submit button, the values of our labels would be passed to the page defined in the &lt;form&gt; tag's ACTION attribute via this &lt;input&gt; tag's NAME and VALUE attributes.  In many server-side programming languages, you have to code this feature in yourself.  ASP.NET does it for you, if a bit cryptically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ASP.NET}}

=Your First ASP.NET Page=
No programming book is complete without a Hello World example as the first project/example.

In ASP.NET creating a quick Hello World example is painless and easy.  At the same time we are going to explore the structure of a basic ASP.NET page.

Let's look at the basic structure of an ASP.NET page.  Doing so will give us a chance to introduce several important aspects relevant to coding ASP.NET pages.

VB.NET

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;%@ Page Language=&quot;VB&quot; %&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
      ' ASP.NET page code goes here
      Sub Page_Load()
        'On Page Load Run this code
      End Sub
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;form runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
      &lt;!-- ASP.NET controls go here --&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt; 
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

C#

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;%@ Page Language=&quot;C#&quot; debug=&quot;true&quot; trace=&quot;false&quot;%&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
      // ASP.NET page code goes here
      void Page_Load() {
        //On Page Load Run this Code
      }
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;    
    &lt;form runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
      &lt;!-- ASP.NET controls go here --&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt; 
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can see, an ASP.NET page has a lot in common with a regular HTML-based page.  Now in order to make our Hello World example we just need to add one line of code to the above examples.

VB.Net
&lt;pre&gt;
      Sub Page_Load()
        'On Page Load Run this code
        Response.Write (&quot;Hello World&quot;)
      End Sub
&lt;/pre&gt;

C#
&lt;pre&gt;
      void Page_Load() {
        //On Page Load Run this Code
        Response.Write(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
      }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Copy the original code into a new file with the extension aspx.  Then make the above modification.  When the file is run, assuming it is being hosted on an ASP.NET compatible web server, you will see the words Hello World on your web browser when you access the page.</text>

==Welcome to ''Miskitu Aisas!''==
[[File:Bandera regne Miskito.png|right|thumb|250px|Flag of the Miskito Nation]]

''Miskitu Aisas!'' (&quot;Speak Miskito!&quot;), a language course in Wikibooks, is an elementary introduction to the Miskito language, spoken in parts of Nicaragua and Honduras. The course focuses primarily on presenting the grammar basics through carefully graded and didactically presented lessons. ''Miskitu Aisas!'' assumes no prior knowledge of the language and no specialised knowledge of linguistics, although at least a general background in &quot;school grammar&quot; will no doubt be helpful, as will any previous experience at learning foreign languages.

As well as an understanding of the language's overall structure, ''Miskitu Aisas!'' will also provide you with a knowledge of some basic vocabulary, and will give you the essential preparation needed to continue studying Miskito by other means, if you should wish to do so. A variety of exercises at every step in the learning path will help you gradually to assimilate both grammar and vocabulary, and to check your progress through comparison of the answers provided. A handy feature that makes this on-line course more interactive is found in the Show/Hide toggle switches that accompany model sentences, exercises and vocabularies. These allow you to customise each page and adapt it to your progress and learning pace by either displaying or concealing translations, answers and meanings.

In the rest of this introduction you can read about who the Miskito people are and what their language is, and how to use this course, as well as quick links to some key pages in the course.

==The Miskito people and their language==

[[File:Mittelamerika-Pos.png|right|thumb|250px|Location of Central America and the Caribbean]]
[[File:CIA map Central America &amp; Caribbean.png|right|thumb|220px|Map of Central America and the Caribbean]]

The Miskito people inhabit an area along the Caribbean (Atlantic) coast of Central America. This area, known as the Mosquito Coast, is mostly within the state of Nicaragua, with a northern section in a neighbouring region of Honduras. The territory extends from Cape Cameron in the north to Río Grande in the south. In origin the Miskitos were a local indigenous people, but in the post-colonial era a great deal of racial mixing occurred. A major component of the present population is descended from escaped slaves from other areas who sought refuge among the Miskito people.

Because of the inaccessibility of the Miskitos' territory, Spanish settlers did not begin to arrive until 1787 and even after this the Miskitos, who already had an experienced army and an established political structure, continued to dominate the land, which consequently suffered only limited influence from the Spanish conquest. The Miskitos remained independent until 1894 when their land became part of Nicaragua, but the Nicaraguans, like the Spanish before them, exercised little control and many Miskitos, even today, do not consider themselves Nicaraguan.

[[File:Mapa Miskito.png|left|thumb|300px|Nicaragua (area inhabited by the Miskito people in red)]]

On the other hand, the Miskito people entered into contact with British colonists as early as the beginning of the seventeenth century, and during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they continued to be influenced by the British, who had economic interests in the area, particularly in the territory of Belize to the northwest (the colonial name for which was British Honduras). As allies of the British the Miskitos were sucked into the slave trade, often being involved in raids against Spanish settlements in Honduras. Such activities brought the Miskitos into contact with other indigenous groups, to whom the Miskitos tended to consider themselves culturally superior. The Miskitos were ruled by their own kings who took on English names (the earliest recorded king, named Oldman, received an audience with king Charles I), and emulated European dress. Following a formal Treaty of Friendship and Alliance between the Miskitos and Britain in 1740, the Miskito Nation was formally a British protectorate until 1787, and British interest in the region continued until the mid-nineteenth century.

In addition to the Miskitos' native language, Miskito, large numbers of Miskitos speak other languages, particularly Miskito Creole English (which arose through contact with the British), neighbouring indigenous languages such as Rama, and Spanish.

With nearly 200,000 speakers, Miskito is the most widely spoken of a family of languages of Nicaragua and Honduras that has come to be known as Misumalpan. This name is formed from parts of the names of the family's subgroups: MIskito, SUmo, MAtagaLPAN. Although some aspects of the internal family tree within this family are uncertain, it is clear that Miskito stands apart from Sumo and Matagalpan, which seem to share a common lower node, and that in the past Miskito was heavily influenced by other Misumalpan languages. Sumo is thought to have been dominant in the area before the period of Miskito ascendancy. Today the relationship has been reversed: many former Sumo speakers have shifted to Miskito, which has in turn heavily influenced the Sumo dialects. Several of these (Tawahka, Panamahka and Tuahka) constitute the Mayangna sub-branch of Sumo, while the Ulwa language is in another sub-branch. The Matagalpan branch of Misumalpan contains two languages that are now extinct: Matagalpa and Cacaopera. The latter was formerly spoken in parts of eastern El Salvador.

In addition to many elements borrowed from other Misumalpan languages, Miskito has a large number of loanwords from English via Creole, such as those in the table on the left. All the above words occur in the first ten lessons of ''Miskitu Aisas!''  Notice how their sounds are adapted to the Miskito language, which only has three vowels: ''a, i, u''.

Even though Spanish is the official language of Nicaragua and Honduras, its influence on Miskito is much more recent and hence more superficial.

==How to use the course==

===Contents and navigation===
There are basically two ways to move around inside this course: (1) use the Table of Contents, or (2) move from page to page using the navigation links.

====The table of contents====
You can get to the table of contents from the course's front page, and also from any other page in the course through a navigation link (see below). If you want to look at the table of contents right now, [[../Contents|'''click here''']]. You are recommended to open it up in a separate browser window so that you can continue reading this page while you inspect the table of contents.

Every page that you need to see as part of the course has a link from the table of contents. Notice how the table of contents page is organised. On the right-hand side there is a list with a darker background, with the heading '''&quot;The project&quot;''' at the top. This section has information about the project of creating this course which may or may not interest you as a user (rather than an author) of the course. A little lower down you see another section, '''&quot;Author's workbench&quot;''', which contains more technical information that is important for people working on development of the course, but probably unnecessary for other readers. The rest of the table of contents, with a paler blue background, includes everything that people using the course to learn (or learn about) Miskito will need. This is also divided into several sections which will now be mentioned.

The '''&quot;Getting started&quot;''' section is where you are now, and as well as this introduction it also includes a guide to pronouncing and spelling the language. These are the pages you will probably want to have at least a quick look at before starting on the lessons. You can always come back to them later on for more detailed study whenever you feel the need.

Next comes the biggest and most important section, '''&quot;The lessons&quot;'''. The links to the first ten lessons are placed where you can't miss them: in the middle of the screen, immediately after the &quot;Getting started&quot; section. When you get through those, you can scroll down a little to see the rest of the lessons currently available.

Near the bottom of the table of contents there are two more sections: '''&quot;Reference section&quot;''' (with vocabularies, appendices, a list of abbreviations and a subject index) and '''&quot;More about Miskito&quot;''' (an external links page and a discussion page).

====Page-to-page navigation====
At the top of every page in the course you will see the flag of the historical Miskito Nation, which is the logo of the course, together with the title of the page or lesson. Notice the three links to the left of the flag logo:

* a &quot;backwards&quot; link which will usually take you to the previous page (assuming you are following the pages of the course in order)
* a &quot;forwards&quot; link (marked '''&gt;Next''') which takes you to the next page in order
* a &quot;Contents&quot; link, which takes you back to the table of contents from any page in the course

You can use these to get around the course. If the &quot;backwards&quot; or &quot;forwards&quot; link takes you where you want to go, you are there with one click. If not, you can go to the table of contents and from there to wherever you want (two clicks away!).

Notice too that there are some links over the vocabulary lists in each lesson providing short cuts to the general vocabularies, the list of abbreviations and the subject index. These will often help you to look up things that you can't remember and are not in the lesson's vocabulary list.

===Structure of the course===
If you are a new user of this course, it would be a good idea to open up [[../Lesson 1|'''Lesson 1''']] (or any other lesson, if you prefer) in a separate browser window so that you can examine it while reading the following description.

Each lesson consists of several learning points, which form the main part of the lesson. At the end of the lesson there is a final section containing a list of the new words in the lesson (the Vocabulary) and a practice activity (a review exercise or a reading). At the beginning of the lesson the table of contents lists the learning points.

Each learning point consists of three components: (1) model sentences, (2) comments and (3) a short practice activity or exercise. Different people learn in different ways, so it is up to each learner to decide exactly how to use these. If we think of the comments as &quot;rules&quot;, then the model sentences act as &quot;examples&quot; to illustrate them. Some people like to study the examples first and read the rules afterwards. If you are able to infer the rule from the model sentences, then the comment will serve to confirm your hypothesis, if it was right, or correct it, if it wasn't. If you follow this procedure, you will probably want to look at the translations of the model sentences, unless you can guess them, by clicking on the &quot;Show&quot; switch on the right.

If, on the other hand, you prefer to work from rules to examples, then leave the translations hidden at first. After reading the comments, see if you can work out what the examples mean before looking up their meanings. You may like to consult the vocabulary at the end of the lesson as you do this; it will give you a better chance of getting them right.

Don't skip the practice activity. You can use it to check whether you understand the point, to test yourself, or to get accustomed to the mechanisms of the language. The exercises will also help you to acquire the vocabulary. Always try the exercise with the answers hidden first before clicking on &quot;Show&quot; to see if you were right.

When you come to the vocabulary list, if you have already worked through the preceding points and gone through the model sentences and exercises you should already know most of the words on the list by now. In fact, you can easily give yourself a vocabulary test, since the meaning of each word will not be visible until you click on the corresponding &quot;Show&quot; button.

The exercise or reading that follows the vocabulary will touch on several of the points you have studied in the lesson and also reviews both old and new vocabulary items. Once again, hide or display the answers as it suits you.

As no good square is available to retreat, Black should exchange the knight : [[/5...Nxc3/]].

The other options include two ways of launching aggressive attacks against White :
:[[/5...Bb4/]]
:[[/5...Qh4/|5...Qh4+]]

'''Meriadoc Brandybuck''', usually referred to as '''Merry''', is featured throughout The Lord of the Rings, and was part of The Fellowship of the Ring.

Merry, a [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings/Races/Hobbits|Hobbit]], was born in the year 2982 of the Third Age.  

A lover of boats and maps, Merry is described as one of [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings/Characters/Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s closest friends and is related to him several times over.

Merry accompanied Frodo on the Quest of Mount Doom.  Captured by [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings/Races/Orcs|Orcs]] with his friend, [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings/Characters/Peregrin Took|Peregrin Took]], they were separated from the rest of The Fellowship of the Ring, but escaped and became the first mortals for centuries to encounter the [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings/Races/Ents|Ents]] of [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings/Places/Fangorn Forest|Fangorn Forest]].  Merry was present at the destruction of [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings/Places/Isengard|Isengard]], and rode to the Battle of the Pelennor with the Rohirrim.  There, he won great renown, for with [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings/Characters/Éowyn|Éowyn]] of [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings/Places/RohanRohan|Rohan]] he defeated and slew the [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings/Characters/Lord of the Nazgûl|Lord of the Nazgûl]].

==Vowels==

There are only three vowels in Miskito: '''a''', '''i''' and '''u'''.

According to Miskito grammars, there is a difference between long and short vowels. Any of the three vowels can be either short or long. The difference seems to be important because some words are distinguished by vowel length, such as:

{| cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 align=&quot;center&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | short vowel
| align=&quot;center&quot; | long vowel
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ecf3f7&quot; |
'''ki''' ''question particle''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ecf3f7&quot; |
'''kî''' ''key''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ecf3f7&quot; |
'''wal''' ''with''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ecf3f7&quot; |
'''wâl''' ''two''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ecf3f7&quot; |
'''wina''' ''from''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ecf3f7&quot; |
'''wîna''' ''meat''
|}

On the other hand, there is some uncertainty about the length of vowels in many words, and it is not usual to mark vowel length consistently in writing. We will mark long vowels with a circumflex accent ('''â, î, û''') only in words that need to be differentiated form similar words having a short vowel.

==Consonants==

Miskito has the following consonants:

{| cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#ecf3f7&quot;
| '''p'''
| '''t'''
|
| '''k'''
|
|
|-
| '''b'''
| '''d'''
|
|
|
|
|-
|
| '''s'''
|
|
|
| '''h'''
|-
| '''m'''
| '''n'''
|
| '''ng'''
|
|
|-
|
| '''l'''
|
|
|
|
|-
|
| '''r'''
|
|
|
|
|-
|
|
| '''y'''
|
| '''w'''
|
|}

==Semivowels and diphthongs==

When the semivowels ''y'' and ''w'' stand between a consonant and a vowel (forming a diphthong), they are generally written as '''i''' and '''u''' respectively, although there is considerable variation on this point in written Miskito. So for example '''la''i''h''' ''far'', '''a''u''''' ''yes'', '''ya''u''ra''' ''whom'', '''t''i''ara''' (or '''tyara''') ''young'', etc. 

'''Y''' is often, and '''w''' usually, preferred preceding a vowel, so '''kwakaia''' ''to open'', '''swiaia''' ''to leave''. '''W''' is sometimes found between two consonants, although here too it alternates with '''u''', e.g. '''yakwra''' (or '''yakura''') ''tall, high''.

Some uses are simply conventional, such as the spelling '''-aia''' (not '''-aya''') in the infinitive suffix.

==Accent and aspiration==

Words are generally accented on their first syllable.

Accented syllables may be aspirated. Aspiration consists of the devoicing of vowels and of any following liquid (''l, r'') or nasal (''m, n, ng'') consonants or semivowels (''i, u'').

Aspiration is indicated in writing by the letter '''h''' at the end of the aspirated syllable. For example:

{| cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#ecf3f7&quot;
| bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; | unaspirated syllable
| bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; | aspirated syllable
| bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; | example
| bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; | meaning
|-
| a
| ah
| '''''ah''kia'''
| ''when''
|-
| li
| lih
| '''''lih'''''
| ''green sea turtle'' (cf. '''li''' ''water'')
|-
| wa
| wah
| '''''wah''ma'''
| ''young man''
|-
| lai
| laih
| '''''laih'''''
| ''far''
|-
| yau
| yauh
| '''''yauh''ka'''
| ''tomorrow''
|-
| dan
| danh
| '''''danh'''''
| ''completely''
|-
| yum
| yumh
| '''''yumh''pa'''
| ''three''
|-
| bang
| bangh
| '''''bangh''waia'''
| plural auxiliary
|-
| wal
| walh
| '''''walh''wal'''
| ''four''
|}

In written Miskito we find a degree of variation regarding the indication of aspiration, and pairs such as '''dara''' or '''dahra''' ''report'', '''lupia''' or '''luhpia''' ''small'', '''karna''' or '''karhna''' ''strong, tough''. In some instances aspiration may also have a grammatical function: for example, the monosyllabic participles in ''-i'' of some verbs may be aspirated in some cases, e.g. '''bri''' or '''brih''' ''having'', '''wi''' or '''wih''' ''going''. Compare also '''wal''' ''two'', '''walhwal''' ''four''.

==Reading practice==

Try reading the following text out loud for practice. For the meaning of the text see [[../Lesson 10#Vocabulary and reading|the end of Lesson 10]].

{| cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background:#ecf3f7&quot;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Yang wark plikisna&quot; win.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Yang nani sin wark plikisna. Man wal wi banghwaisna.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

      <comment>mutual exclusivity is not the same as independence</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The population''' or the '''sample space''' refers to the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment that is random. If you toss a coin there are two possible outcomes: head (H) or tail (T). If you toss two coins, there are four outcomes: HH, HT, TH and TT, where the first letter refers to the outcome of the first tossing and the second to that of the second tossing. Each outcome is called a '''sample point'''.

An '''event''' is a subset of a sample space. If we want to list all sample points with the occurrence of at least one H, we have HH, HT and TH. Any events are called '''mutually exclusive''' if, for any one trial of the experiment, the occurrence of one event implies the non-occurrence of the other event. For instance, if we got a head on one occasion, we could not simultaneously get a tail.
Note: To say that any 2 events are independent means something else entirely.

Events are '''exhaustive''' if there is no other possible event. For instance, the events two heads (HH), one head and one tail (HT and TH), and two tails (TT) are all possible outcomes if tossing the coin twice. Thus, the list of events is exhaustive.

* Explain how scientists discovered subatomic particles.
* Explain how today's model of the atom developed. 
* Describe the structure of the nuclear atom. 
* Vocab: element, electron, proton, neutron, and electron cloud.
*Think about the different models of the atom, draw them and compare between them.

J. Thomson], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr Niels Bohr]

=First Thoughts=
Do you like mysteries? Are you curious? Don't be embarrassed. Humans have alway been curious. Someone always wants to know something that is not easy to detect or to see what can’t be seen. For example, people began wondering about matter more than 2,500 years ago. Some of the Greek philosophers thought that matter was composed of tiny particles. They reasoned that you could take a piece of matter, cut it in half, cut the half piece in half again, and continue to cut again and again. Eventually, you wouldn’t be able to cut any more. You would have only one particle left. They named these particles &quot;atomos,&quot; a term that means &quot;indivisible.&quot; Another way to imagine this is to picture a string of beads. If you keep dividing the string into pieces, you eventually come to one single bead.

==Describing the Unseen==
The Greek philosophers didn’t try to prove their theories by doing experiments as scientists now do. Their theories were the result of reasoning, debating, and discussion - not of evidence or proof. Today, scientists will not accept a theory that is not supported by experimental evidence. But even if the Greek philosophers had experimented, they could not have proven the existence of atoms. People had not yet discovered much about what is now called chemistry, the study of matter. The kind of equipment needed to study matter was a long way from being invented. Even as recently as 500 years ago, atoms were still a mystery.

=Different Atomic Theories=

==Dalton's Atomic Theory==
One of the first published theories of the atom was proposed by John Dalton, an English chemist born in 1766.  His theory had five main points to it. 
1.) Elements are made of tiny parts called &quot;atoms.&quot;
2.) The atoms of a given element are different from those of any other element, and are distinguishable by their atomic weight.
3.) All atoms of a given element are identical.  (Now known to be false - see the section on Isotopes [coming soon].)
4.) Atoms of one element can combine with atoms of another element to form chemical compounds.  A given compound will always have the same relative numbers of different atoms. 
5.) Atoms can neither be created nor divided by a chemical reaction, merely grouped together in different ways. 

==Discovering The Electron==
The news of Crooke’s experiments excited the scientific community of the time. But many scientists were not convinced that the cathode rays were streams of particles. Was the greenish glow light, or was it a stream of charged particles? In 1897, J.J. Thomson, an English physicist, tried to clear up the confusion. He placed a magnet beside the tube from Crooke’s experiments. Light cannot be bent by a magnet, so the beam couldn’t be light. Therefore, Thomson concluded that the beam must be made up of charged particles of matter that came from the cathode.

Thomson then repeated the CRT experiment using different metals for the cathode and different gases in the tube. He found that the same charged particles were produced no matter what elements were used for the cathode or the gas in the tube. Thomson concluded that cathode rays are negatively charged particles of matter. How did Thomson know the particles were negatively charged? He knew that opposite charges attract each other. He observed that these particles were attracted to the positively charged anode, so he reasoned that the particles must be negatively charged. 

These negatively charged particles are now called &quot;electrons.&quot; Thomson also inferred that electrons are a part of every kind of atom because they are produced by every kind of cathode material. Perhaps the biggest surprise that came from Thomson’s experiments was the evidence that particles smaller than the atom do exist.

==Thomson's Atomic Model==



[[Image:Bohr-planetary-atom-model.jpg|thumb|307px|The Bohr model of the atom&lt;br&gt;Showing electron quantum jumping to ground state n=1]] 
Some of the questions posed by scientists were answered in light of Thomson’s experiments. However, the answers inspired new questions. If atoms contain one or more negatively charged particles, then all matter, which is made of atoms, should be negatively charged as well. But all matter isn’t negatively charged. How can this be explained? Could it be that atoms also contain some positive charge? The negatively charged electrons and the unknown positive charge would then neutralize each other in the atom. Thomson came to this conclusion and included positive charge in his model of the atom. 

Using his new findings, Thomson revised Dalton’s model of the atom. Instead of a solid ball that was the same throughout, Thomson pictured a sphere of positive charge. The negatively charged electrons were spread evenly among the positive charge. This is modeled by a ball of clay. The positive charge of the clay is equal to the negative charge of the electrons. Therefore, the atom is neutral. It was later discovered that not all atoms are neutral. The number of electrons within an element can vary. If there is more positive charge than negative electrons, the atom has an overall positive charge. If there are more negative electrons than positive charge, the atom has an overall negative charge.
Kent-Meridian High School- Austin Shelfoe

==Rutherford's Experiments==
A model is not accepted in the scientific community until it has been tested and the tests support previous observations. In 1906, Ernest Rutherford and his coworkers began an experiment to find out if Thomson’s model of the atom was correct. They wanted to see what would happen when they fired fast-moving, positively charged bits of matter, called alpha particles, at a thin film of a metal such as gold. Alpha particles come from unstable atoms. Alpha particles are positively charged, and so they are repelled by particles of matter which also have a positive charge.

A source of alpha particles was aimed at a thin sheet of gold foil that was only 400 nm thick. The foil was surrounded by a fluorescent screen that gave a flash of light each time it was hit by a charged particle.&quot;I had observed the scattering of alpha particles, and... it was as if you had fired a 15-inch naval shell at a piece of tissue paper and the shell came right back and hit you... it was then that I had an idea of an atom with a minute massive centre, carrying a charge.&quot;

=A New Model of the Atom=

Most models of atomic structure are very difficult to comprehend, especially at introductory levels. Kreswell has suggested a more visually intuitive atomic model enabling a deeper understanding of how nature works at it most fundamental level.

      <comment>/* Lexicon */ use sortable table</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{miskito/Title| |Planned lexicon| |Syllabus|Lesson structure}}

==Explanation==

The table below is an initial lexical &quot;source inventory&quot;. It represents a preliminary inventory of possible candidates for inclusion in the eventual lexicon (vocabulary) of the course. It is the not necessarily the case that a given item will end up in the course: that will be decided on an item-by-item basis as the development of the course unfolds. Thus, in the process of developing the lessons the present inventory serves as a checklist.

The present list was produced in a rather primitive manner through intuitive judgments about likelihood of each word's usefulness or importance. That is why it only represents a preliminary inventory! The procedure followed was to go through a [http://rds.org.hn/docs/listas/moskitia/diccionario/diccionario.html '''Miskito-Spanish dictionary'''] selecting some entries and copying these into a Word file. In the next step, the words selected were copied manually into a second file containing a four-column table (as below): the first three columns (Miskito, Spanish, part of speech) were taken from the source dictionary entries, and the fourth column (semantic field) was added.

Using Microsoft Word's sorting functions, from this tabulation we can mechanically generate four tables, ordered alphabetically by each of the four columns, giving us a Miskito-Spanish list, a Spanish-Miskito list, a list ordered by parts of speech and a thematic (semantic) list. Once these lists have been produced they may be used to review the resulting inventory checking for possible &quot;defects&quot;. For example: using the thematic list we couild see what items have been entered for the semantic category &quot;animals&quot; and see whether this set of items looks like a sensible, balanced selection, whether any obvious items have been overlooked, whether any item has been accidentally placed in the wrong category, etc. etc. Referring back to the source dictionary, we can then attempt to correct and improve the inventory.

The reason why this table lists Spanish rather than English glosses is simply that it was decided to copy the glosses fairly mechanically from the source dictionary at this point. Translating the glosses might possibly have introduced a margin of error or confusion because of different possible translations and the possibility of misunderstandings. Authors using this list will therefore need some knowledge of Spanish to use this resource (sorry about that).

'''Warning:''' There may still be mistakes or inappropriate choices in this list, which is only intended as a rough checklist and working aid. Therefore the information shown here should never be taken on trust when developing the lessons, but rechecked against fuller sources (especially the source dictionary).

== Overview ==
Bilbo Baggins is the main character in [[Guide to The Lord of the Rings/Books/The Hobbit|The Hobbit]]. Bilbo is also a supporting character in The Lord of the Rings, being a ring-bearer. He is a hobbit of The Shire and lives in a hobbit-hole known as Bag End. Bag End was a luxurious home built by Bilbo's father, Bungo Baggins for Bilbo's mother, Belladonna Took. Bilbo lived a comfortable life in his neighborhood in The Shire, not interested in any adventures taking him away from his village, until he was hired by Thorin and Company on the Quest of Erebor, where he went on an adventure to reclaim the dwarves' lost treasure. On the way, under the Misty Mountains, he found the One Ring and kept it for decades until he gave it up to Frodo for it to be destroyed, since the only thing stopping Sauron was the ring being away from him.

== Role in the Books ==

=== The Hobbit ===
Bilbo played a major role in this book, being the protagonist. He was invited by Thorin and Company to be their burglar on an adventure to Erebor to reclaim The Lonely Mountain from the dragon, Smaug. When the dwarves from Thorin and Company arrived at Bilbo's home, he wasn't too keen on going on any adventures but when the next day arrived and he found out that the dwarves had left and were waiting at an inn. This is where he changed his mind. The first thing Bilbo did as burglar was investigate a light in the forest. He finds trolls and attempts to pickpocket one. He was caught and as the dwarves came to see what was taking so long they  were saved by Gandalf keeping them arguing until it became daylight and they turned to stone. In the trolls' lair Bilbo finds a sword perfect for him, which he later names Sting.

Bilbo and the company stop and Rivendell and go to the Misty Mountains from there. Where he and the company fell down a trap. Bilbo loses the company and bumps his head. He finds himself in a dark tunnel and finds a small ring, the One Ring. At the time he thought it was just a normal ring, he put it in his pocket. He encounters a creature named Gollum. They play a game of riddles, if Bilbo won, Gollum would show him the way out. Bilbo won, but he asked a rather unfair question. Gollum discovers that his ring is gone. Gollum believes Bilbo stole it. He chases Bilbo but when Bilbo puts on the ring. Gollum doesn't notice him. He vanished.

Bilbo finds his way out and is reunited with the company. They stopped for the night near a small group of pine trees when wargs (wolves) find them. They climb up the trees to escape. Gandalf uses his magic to set fire to pine cones and he threw them at the wargs. The wargs fled and they were rescued by eagles.

The group traveled to Beorn's house where they rested, after being taken in by Beorn and his animal servants. Beorn learned about their story and gave a large number of provisions to help their quest. Beorn also lent several ponies to be used until the group reached Mirkwood. However, Beorn did not fully trust the dwarves, so Bilbo saw Beorn giving careful watch to see that his ponies were unharmed. Eventually the company reached Mirkwood, where the ponies were let go (to several of the dwarves discontent) and Gandalf left the group as well, warning them, &quot;Do not stray off the path.&quot;

The Company began to follow the path through the treacherous forest. Eventually the provisions ran low and the Company was forced to send Bilbo up a tree to see where the forest ended. Bilbo climbed up a tree, where a rewarding breeze of cool air and butterflies met him. Bilbo only saw more forest, so when he reluctantly climbed back down, he did not see that the forest ended. He reported his findings to the dwarves, where they met the news with ill comfort, angry that the dwarves were fatter than Bilbo and so could not climb the trees to feel cool air or see the butterflies. Eventually the last provisions were eaten. The Company then came upon the Enchanted River. Bilbo saw a boat on the other side, leading the dwarves to retrieve it. A deer came out of nowhere when all the dwarves were on the other side. A dwarf shot it where it died, on the other side. The dwarves hoped for venison for dinner when Bilbo realized that Bombur was drowning. The dwarves fished him out, where he was asleep, but the boat was knocked away, ending the hope for venison.

While wandering down the path, the dwarves saw lights in the forest. Deciding that they would rather leave the path then starve to death they headed after the lights. As soon as they got to the lights, they went out and one of their party fell asleep. This happened twice. On the third time all of them fell asleep. 

When Bilbo awoke in the night, he was alone. He cursed the dwarves for leaving the path and discovered that spiders had captured his companions. Bilbo was forced to find his lost companions and cut through the cocoons the spiders had formed around his companions. He distracted the spiders by improvising several insulting songs to irritate the spiders, who left their domain to find the insulter and eat him. Bilbo killed a few by throwing stones at a few spiders and he killed more via his sword. They never found his since he use the Ring to turn invisible. After freeing the dwarves, he led them into a charge against the spiders, where Bilbo killed dozens of the arachnids with the help of the Ring and his sword.

After traveling through Mirkwood Forest they had been taken prisoner by Wood-elves, who believed that the company had &quot;assaulted&quot; the elves while they were partying (the bright lights the company had seen in the forest). Shortly after, the travelers had gone to Lake Town, a small town occupied by men. Here is where Smaug would frequently attack, though he had not been seen in many years. The group had fended off the Dragon until Bard shot the Black Arrow at the single bare spot on the dragon's jewel encrusted underbelly. Killing it and sending him to rot at the bottom of the lake, and destroying part of Lake Town. Here, after Thorin Oakenshield reclaimed the mountain, the Battle of the Five Armies took place. Beorn, the Beorning chieftain, joined the travelers in their fight against an army of orcs.

After the battle, a soldier sent by Gandalf to search for him found Bilbo. Then Gandalf takes him to Thorin, who was lying on a bed, dying. Thorin apologizes to Bilbo about how Thorin cursed Bilbo, and Thorin then praised Bilbo's beliefs, that food and drink is valued higher than gold or treasure. Bilbo later attends Thorin's funeral. After the funeral, Dain offers him his one-fourteenth share of the treasure, which Bilbo turns down, receiving only two small chests, one with gold, and the other laden with silver. Bilbo traveled back with the wood-elf host that participated in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo traveled with the wood-elves down to Mirkwood, and then went to Beorn's house with Gandalf. Then Bilbo set out with Gandalf to where Bert, Tom, and William turned to stone. They dug up some of the buried treasure the dwarves buried earlier, in which Bilbo offered most of it to Gandalf to use to aid the peoples of Middle-Earth. Bilbo eventually made it back to Hobbiton, where he witnessed an auction selling most of his possessions to the other hobbits. His relatives, the Sackville-Baggins were...vexed to see Bilbo alive since they wanted to live in Bag End so badly. Bilbo had to buy back his sold possessions in order to avoid quarreling. Eventually, Balin and Gandalf visited him, where they reported the current news of Middle-earth.

=== The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King ===

On September 22, a farewell Birthday Party was held in his honour, where he announced his intention to leave the Shire, to the shock of his family and friends. Immediately afterwards, he put on his ring and disappeared, as a joke on his neighbours. He returned to his house where he was confronted by his friend Gandalf, who tried to persuade him to leave the ring for Frodo.

Bilbo initially agreed, but then became hostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the ring for his own benefit, which he referred to as his &quot;precious.&quot; Horrified by Bilbo's outburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and ordered Bilbo to leave it behind. Immediately Bilbo returned to his senses, apologising and admitting that the Ring had been troubling him lately. After a moment of inner struggle, Bilbo finally dropped the ring to the ground, becoming the first ring-bearer to give up the ring on his own will. Bilbo and Gandalf bid each other goodbye, and Bilbo left the Shire for his journey.

On the same day, Bilbo left the One Ring and his home of Bag End in the possession of his relative, Frodo Baggins who was eager to be his own master despite the loss of Bilbo, for he was not yet ready to leave the Shire. After his departure, Bilbo accompanied three dwarves to Dale and the Lonely Mountain, before finally settling in Rivendell. There, he met Aragorn and Elrond.

Between TA 3003 and TA 3018, Bilbo worked on the written account of his adventures, in a book that would later be known as the Red Book of Westmarch. He also studied the Elvish language and compiled a three-volume history of the Elder Days, which he called Translations from the Elvish. He composed the poem All that is Gold Does Not Glitter for Aragorn as well as a much longer poem about Eärendil during his stay at Rivendell.

In October 3018, Frodo arrived at Rivendell. Bilbo learnt that his nephew was on a quest to destroy the One Ring so he gave him the sword Sting and for protection his mithril shirt. However, he remained in Rivendell while Frodo travelled south. After Frodo returned, Bilbo had noticeably aged, partially freed from the Ring's effect, although he continued to desire it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=The Welsh Number System=
Welsh, being a Celtic language, traditionally used the base 20 (vigesimal) system. This system is common among adults, but not so common among children (who now use the newer base 10 system).

==Vigesimal System==

Using a base of 20 means that numbers start counting again when you reach 20 instead of the modern (and common) 10. A few vestiges of this type of system exist in English (e.g Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address: ''Four score and seven years ago...'') as well as in other languages (French 80 ''quatre-vingts, lit.'' four twenties)

The numbers (1-20):

{|cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; border =&quot;1&quot;
|-
|1||Un||11||Unarddeg
|-
|2||Dau||12||Deuddeg
|-
|3||Tri||13||Tri ar ddeg
|-
|4||Pedwar||14||Pedwar ar ddeg
|-
|5||Pump||15||Pymtheg
|-
|6||Chwech||16||Un ar bymtheg
|-
|7||Saith||17||Dau ar bymtheg
|-
|8||Wyth||18||Deunaw
|-
|9||Naw||19||Pedwar ar bymtheg
|-
|10||Deg||20||Ugain
|}

(Note ''deunaw'' literally means &quot;two nines&quot; - 18)

From this point, we count the same, only adding ''ar hugain'' (on twenty) at the end

{|cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
|21||Un ar hugain
|- 
|22||Dau ar hugain
|-
|23||Tri ar hugain
|-
|24||Pedwar ar hugain
|-
|25||Pump ar hugain
|-
|26||Chwech ar hugain
|-
|27||Saith ar hugain 
|-
|28||Wyth ar hugain
|-
|29||Naw ar hugain
|-
|30||Deg ar hugain
|-
|31||Unarddeg ar hugain
|-
|32||Deuddeg ar hugain
|-
|33||Tri ar ddeg ar hugain
|-
|34||Pedwar ar ddeg ar hugain
|-
|35||Pymtheg ar hugain
|-
|36||Un ar bymtheg ar hugain
|-
|37||Dau ar bymtheg ar hugain
|-
|38||Deunaw ar hugain
|-
|39||Pedwar ar bymtheg ar hugain
|-
|40||Deugain
|}
-
This system repeats itself until 60 (note, 50 on its own is often called ''Hanner cant'' - half a hundred), and on again until 80

*''Trigain'' - 60
*''Pedwar Ugain'' - 80

When we get to 100, we use ''cant''. This time, we use ''cant a/ac'', thus:

*''Cant ac un'' - 101
*''Cant ac un ar hugain'' - 121 (literally ''One hundred and one on twenty'')

==Further numbers==

*''Mil'' - 1000
*''Deg Mil'' - 10,000
*''Can Mil'' - 100,000
*''Miliwn'' - 1 Million
*''Biliwn'' - 1 Billion

==Decimal System==

As Welsh language education took off, the difficulties of using a base 20 number when trying to teach children maths became apparent (three score and eleven minus three, anyone?), so a decimal system in common with other Indo-European languages was set up to make the teaching in Welsh simpler. This system has become common among the younger generation, in the same way the metric system has taken hold in the UK as a whole.

=== Move to Haskell wiki? ===
I'd like to start discussion as to whether we should move to the Haskell wiki.

Pros:
* Haskell syntax highlighting!
* Closer to the hub of the Haskell community. Corollaries:
** Easier for newbies to find us.
** Easier for potential contributors to find us.
** Easier to import content already on the Haskell wiki.
* We could potentially change the code to the wiki or install new plugins etc if we wanted to. (Automate the 'next page', 'prev page' links? Etc.)

Cons:
* The bother of letting everyone know we're moving
* The bother of moving itself
** I'm sure there's going to be some MediaWiki export/import tool somewhere, though.

:It would be tricky for sheer reason of licensing issues.  For example, after bugging Hal all this time, I'm not sure I really want to bother him again to ask about the simple permissive license.  We've received a lot of contributions from a lot of users and would have to get everyone aboard.  For what it's worth, I personally agree to dual license my stuff under the simple permissive license.  I do agree that the Haskell syntax highlighting would be nice to have, though, as would having this be a Haskell.org product.  Then again, Wikibooks has a specific focus on creating textbooks, one single cohesive narrative.  The Haskell wiki is perhaps not the most appropriate venue for that, culturally.  Well... I guess that's a pretty weak argument on my part :-) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 17:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
::Could we have some arrangement whereby we have a subwiki of the Haskell wiki which is seperately licensed? Or maybe even a seperate wiki? I think the benefits of moving to haskell.org are worth it. [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 13:41, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
:::Hmm... I'm still quite hesitant about this.  As an alternative, would it be possible to have a haskell.org address that automatically pops up here?  The user types in http://haskell.org/wikibook and winds up getting served by wikibooks?  What if we had Haskell markup? (''Edit 18:13 - I meant what if we also had Haskell syntax highlighting on wikibooks?'')  I get the feeling that moving would entail a certain amount of pain and confusion (for example, what will happen if we delete our content here and post a 'so long, folks!'  It seems the wikibooks people would just restore the content and we'd have two &quot;competing&quot; wikibooks, a bit like Spanish wikipedia and the other unofficial site from the early days.  (That being said, if we did move, sooner would be better than later, and I personally would migrate to the haskell.org version). -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 15:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Note, I've posted a message on the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] asking for input from the wikibooks community at large.  This might enrich the deliberations a bit, maybe get some useful insight into making these kinds of decisions.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 18:12, 8 January 2007 (UTC)


== Chapter organization &amp; content ==
=== Title of this book ===
Aww, what's wrong with ''Functional Programming with Sexy Types''?  If it is inaccurate (for example, the sexy features are not really used in day-to-day Haskell), I would understand.  But are there any other objections to the use of &quot;Sexy&quot;? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:12, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

=== Wikibook intro ===
Hmm... i dunno, I'm not sure I like what I wrote... how could we improve this?  For starters, can we get rid of my enjoy-the-ride cliché and find a nicer way to end this intro? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:38, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

=== Table of Contents: the 3 tracks ===
The relative amounts of content between the two tracks is becoming ridiculous. I prepared a [[Haskell/New contents|new contents page]], thoughts? [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 15:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

:I went ahead and changed this. Complain if you don't like it. [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 13:59, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

::I think it's an improvement.  It looks kinda clunky though (not to say the old one was any better).  We could think about simplifying it a bit more, finding ways to make it sleeker, easier to navigate -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 15:00, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

:::It's fine. I think the &quot;clunky&quot; comes from the fact that some names span multiple lines. While this cannot be avoided, you can indent them or use * as separators. I changed things to use *, yell if that's no good.

=== &quot;Beginner's track&quot; ===
The ordering of lessons matters!

==== Pedagogical: Risks and Benefits ====
This paper, [http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/CK02a.html The Risks and Benefits of Teaching Purely Functional Programming in First Year] might be especially interesting to us, of course, depending on what our goals are.

One of the things that this paper suggests, which I think we agree with, is that IO should be introduced earlier rather than later, though the monadic stuff should be avoided (at least in the beginning).  We certainly don't want the reader to treat IO as magical, we just need to explain it differently.  Another thing which resonated is that we need to be careful about higher order functions.  That kind of stuff is hard to wrap your head around if you're a newbie.  The paper says that students get &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; rather easily, but &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt; is a whole other story.  I can certainly relate to that.  While higher order functions have always made &quot;sense&quot; to me, I recall that &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt; was very difficult for me to understand until I actually tried to build large programs. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:58, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

==== Problems in the ordering of the lessons ====
If you go to &quot;Elementary Haskell :: More on Functions&quot; and click on &quot;Next Page&quot; at the bottom, you're taken to &quot;Elementary Haskell :: Pattern Matching&quot;, but in the Table of Contents, the lesson &quot;Elementary Haskell :: Higher-order functions and Currying&quot; lies between these two. Also, the &quot;Elementary Haskell :: Pattern Matching&quot; lessons instructs you to &quot;recall&quot; the lesson on type declaration, but this lesson only appears much later on in &quot;'''Intermediate''' Haskell :: Type Declarations&quot;. - Nebu Pookins 10:49, 6 October 2006 (GMT-5)

:Thanks for your comments.  I have attempted to fix things by reordering some stuff, namely:
:* Noted stuff above
:* Removed [[Haskell/A Miscellany of Types]] - I think this stuff is now better covered by [[Haskell/Type basics]] and maybe the standard library
:* Move control structures and pattern matching so that it is earlier - This stuff seems way easier than higher order functions and currying, and it's useful immediately, whereas the function stuff will need to sink in for a while before the reader really knows what to do with it -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 23:55, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

==== Proposal: Split the chapter &quot;Variables and functions&quot; ====
Hi,

I'm new here and I really like what you people are doing.  I have a suggestion and I'm interested in knowing what people here think of it.  My proposal is that the chapter called &quot;Variables and functions&quot; be split into two separate chapters.

The first of the chapters would be called something like &quot;evaluating expressions&quot; (which would work for those already programmers) or &quot;using haskell as a calculator&quot; (which would be more suited to those who aren't programmers already).  In here readers would be guided through the process of using ghci to do simple arithmetic, string manipulations, boolean algebra and calling simple built-in functions.  For some people who only want to use Haskell as a beefed-up calculator such a chapter would be ideal.  At the end of the chapter we could deal with more complicated expressions - thereby laying down the motivation for the next chapter.

The next chapter &quot;writing functions&quot;.  I purposely omitted the word 'variable' because the word carries a lot of intellectual baggage from other programming languages that don't apply to Haskell which might set readers to the wrong track.

-- [[User:Newhoggy|Newhoggy]] 12:50, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

:It might be worth trying.  I just recently noticed [[Haskell/Beginning]] which seems somewhat similar to the approach that you propose.  It would also be worth seeing how Hal does it in [[Haskell/YAHT]] and figuring out if it does what we're looking  for. Perhaps you should try and see.  The worst that can happen is that we discuss and renegociate.  If you're not willing to commit to an entire chapter overhaul, you could experiment by making subpages on your own user page... -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:14, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

:: Thanks Kowey.  I've decide to work on another article instead [[User:Newhoggy/UTF8_for_Haskell]] -- [[User:Newhoggy|Newhoggy]] 11:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

==== More rearranging ====
I've made the following three changes.  I think it's worth discussing because this is the basic stuff, so it's important to get the pedagogical bits right:
* Moved recursion and more about lists from Haskell Basics down to Elementary Haskell - recursion's a pretty deep concept, and the student can get away with not knowing about it for a while yet
* Moved [[Haskell/Type declarations]] up to the end of Haskell Basics - if we're going to talk about types, we might as well give the student a way to work with them.  Also, it makes it a bit easier to talk about IO below
* Moved [[Haskell/Simple input and output]] out from Intermediate Haskell to Haskell Basics - IO should really come early on so that people who have programmed before don't think that doing a simple Hello World is hard stuff or that you need crazy monadic stuff.  Moving it up early also means we can offer more hands off stuff, writing complete programs from the get-go. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 02:04, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

=== &quot;Advanced track&quot; ===

==== Chapter organization ====
While names like &quot;Wider Theory&quot; or &quot;Haskell Performance&quot; do what they should, I think they're a bit dull. I'd really like to have shiny names, like &quot;Fun with Types&quot;. Here are some proposals. The intended contents is also noted. Besides, every chapter could get an introductory section accessible via the TOC. The names of these subchapters can be picked to match the chapters intensions to allow for funnier chapter names. [[User:Apfelmus|Apfelmus]] 12:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

; &quot;Advanced Haskell&quot;
: Currently a refuge for stuff that doesn't fit anywhere else. Possible independence movements:
: * &quot;The Awkward Squad&quot; (Concurrency, IO, Exceptions, operational semantics)
; &quot;Wider theory&quot;
: = &lt;strike&gt;&quot;Program correctness&quot;&lt;/strike&gt;, &lt;strike&gt;&quot;Formal program manipulation&quot;&lt;/strike&gt;, &quot;To denote or not to denote&quot;, &quot;Meaning, the Meany&quot;, &quot;Devoting to Denotation&quot;
: ''intro'' = &quot;Why does my program work?&quot;, &quot;What does my program do?&quot;, &quot;Help, my program doesn't work!&quot; (sneaky, because the chapter should ''not'' cover debugging)
: Intended to contain methods to reason about program semantics/correctnes and their adherence to a specification. Also includes the systematic derivation of programs from their specification. In a wider sense, relations to logic and dependent types might go here, too. I'm not sure what to do with category theory, but it certainly is a framework for denotational semantics.
; &quot;Fun With Types&quot;
: = &quot;Types: reloaded&quot;, &quot;Types: extended&quot;
: ''intro'' = 
: Currently describes the manifold extensions to Haskell's type system. I'm not sure, but I think that in the long term, they need a (separate?) chapter showing how to put them to good use, i.e. &quot;Program/Library design&quot;.
; &quot;Haskell Performance&quot;
: = &lt;strike&gt;&quot;Haskell in Space and Time&quot;&lt;/strike&gt;, &quot;Space and Time&quot;, &quot;Running Haskell&quot;, &quot;Haskell on the Machine&quot;
: ''intro'' = &quot;Help, my program is slow!&quot;
: Contains everything related to the actual execution of Haskell programs (execution times, how to decrease them, memory, evaluation order, ...)

== Aquiring new content ==
=== Practical Haskell ===
Hi.. I've been invited to integrate my work into this project and I am interested.
I have to warn you all that I am new to wikibooks however...

Anyway, the way my thinking has been going is toward building a standard repertoire of programs which are used over and over again but shown with different user-interfaces for example or modified in different ways using library bindings (or perhaps adding hs-plugins or making interfacing to databases even)...  In theory, I think such an approach will make it very easy for people to pick up a new binding if they've already  been thru the tutorial for another one. Also it should allow for an easy separation of general haskell parts of the examples from those which are specific to the binding in question.

I already have a start of the tutorial along with a rough draft of the overall format  [http://haskell.org/hawiki/PracticalHaskell here] (Please scroll down until you reach the first link on the page)

Also, i have a version of bouncing ball implemented using openGL bindings that kpreid from #haskell on freenode casually offered.

Anyway, I think integrating that format into this wikibook could be a serious modification... so i want to reach out to see how others feel about that approach.. 

What i'm thinking is everything under &quot;Tutorials&quot; might get sort of swallowed and integrated into this over-arching format.

I made this a sub-section to try to keep it organized... Once integration of my project into this wikibook is well underway (if ever), I'll just delete this section and everything underneath it as I suspect it will become osbolete and I imagine its preferable to keep the talk page relevant.. Instead maybe We'll just have a sort of suggested policy posted about this part of the wikibook. If you want to title your reply to this section, please use 4 = signs on either side of the title..

:Ah, I take it this means you saw my note on HaWiki? Glad you're with us in any case. We've known for some time now that we needed a Practical Haskell section, but have been concentrating more on the basics and the advanced stuff.  So having somebody really care about the Practical Haskell session makes me happy.

:Note that wikibooks and wikipedia in general have a culture of boldness, that is, if you think something is the right thing to do, or even worth trying, go ahead and do it! Maybe put something on the discussion page to let people know why, but overall, just doing it makes things go very fast.  The worst that can happen is that somebody would object on the discussion page, and we would have to discuss a bit to reach consensus.  I don't think Haskell wikibookians are revert-war inclined, but who knows?

:That being said, we sometimes hang out on #haskell, me as kowey, and DavidHouse as dmhouse, and if you feel like bouncing off a couple of ideas or for stra-te-gerising (you know, big picture, what are we really trying to do stuff), that's a good place to find us.

:Welcome! -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:43, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

:P.S. Another note.  Interestingly, [[Haskell/Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours]] also has a hands-on task oriented approach.  Don't know how that fits in, but potential food for thought. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:45, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

=== Yet Another Haskell Tutorial ===
I did a horrible job importing the LaTeX, but here it is: [[Haskell/YAHT]] (note: solutions are HTML commented.  I would like to add a switch to my script so that I can output the solutions into a separate file, but that's for another day) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 21:32, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

:Ok, have cleaned up the import somewhat.  Now it even has solutions and working internal links.  One of admins is somewhat concerned about copyright issues though, and has advised me not to do anything until I can get Hal to do something about the license.  Perhaps if I got him to put the text of the Haskell.org simple permissive license (or the GFDL), that should satisfy them.

::Yay! Copyright issues resolved! -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 21:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)


== Marketing and merchandise ==
=== Announcement to the Haskell mailing lists ===
Hi all. I think at some point we should send a message to the Haskell mailing list: haskell@haskell.org, that outlines:

* What the Wikibook is
* Some brief history
* Our current project status
* Our goals
* A request for more contributors

I'd like to drum up some ideas about this. What do people think to the above outline? Did I miss anything?  Also, what ''is'' the history of the Haskell wikibook? Who started it?

Finally, I think we should hold off sending an email until we reach some kind of acceptable 'beta' version of the Wikibook. This should include:

* Most of the introductory chapters complete or at least nearing completion; all done to a high standard and not 'hacked together'.
* Some flesh in the intermediate chapters
* Ideas for extensions, should suitably qualified contributors happen upon the wikibook.
* A professional look, including consistent typographical conventions and use of templates. Perhaps it's also worth starting to think about a logo or opening graphic.

:And re: History, I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell&amp;oldid=14863 started] the wikibook in 2004, just a stubful of wikipedia content, back when I had no idea what I was talking about. Paul Johnson added the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell&amp;oldid=326187 first real content], and then I added my monadic stuff, DavidHouse came on board and from that point, we started getting substantial &quot;outside&quot; contributions like [[Haskell/GUI]].  At least, that's how I remember it.  We can always look in the histor(ies) to get a clearer idea.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 04:41, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Probability Density Function of a Continuous Random Variable */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Probability Mass Function of a Discrete Random Variable ==

A '''probability mass function''' ''f(x)'' (PMF) of ''X'' is a function that determines the probability in terms of the input variable ''x'', which is a discrete '''random variable''' (rv).

A pmf has to satisfy the following properties:

* &lt;math&gt; f(x) =\begin{cases}
 P(X = x_i) &amp; \mbox{for } i = 1, 2, \cdots, n \\
 0 &amp; \mbox{for } x \ne x_i
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

*The sum of PMF over all values of ''x'' is one:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_i f(x_i)= 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Probability Density Function of a Continuous Random Variable ==
The continuous PDF requires that the input variable ''x'' is now a continuous rv. The following conditions must be satisfied:

*All values are greater than zero. 
&lt;math&gt;
f(x) \ge 0
&lt;/math&gt;
*The total area under the PDF is one
&lt;math&gt;
\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = 1
&lt;/math&gt;
*The area under the interval [a, b] is the total probability within this range 
&lt;math&gt;
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = P(a \le x \le b)
&lt;/math&gt;

== Joint Probability Density Functions ==
Joint '''pdf'''s are ones that are functions of two or more random variables. The function

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(X \in A, Y \in B) &amp; = \int_{A} \, \int_{B} f(x,y) \, dx \, dy \\
&amp; = 0, \mbox{if } x \notin A \mbox{ and } y \notin B \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the '''continuous joint probability density function'''. It gives the joint probability for x and y.

The function

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
p(X \in A, Y \in B) &amp; = \sum_{X \in A} \sum_{Y \in B} p(x, y) \\
&amp; = 0, \mbox{if } x \notin A \mbox{ and } Y \notin y \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

is similarly the '''discrete joint probability density function'''

== Marginal Probability Density Function ==
The marginal '''PDFs''' are derived from the joint PDFs. If the joint pdf is integrated over the distribution of the X variable, then one obtains the marginal PDF of y, &lt;math&gt; f(y) &lt;/math&gt;. The continuous marginal probability distribution functions are:

&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \int_{y}^B f(x,y) dy
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
f(y) = \int_{x}^A f(x,y) dx
&lt;/math&gt;

and the discrete marginal probability distribution functions are

&lt;math&gt;
p(x) = \sum_{y \in B} p(x, y)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
p(y) = \sum_{x \in A} p(x, y)
&lt;/math&gt;

== Conditional Probability Density Function ==

&lt;math&gt;
f(x \mid y) = P(X = x, Y = y) = \frac{f(x,y)}{f(y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
f(y \mid x) = P(Y = y, X = x) = \frac{f(x,y)}{f(x)}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{miskito/Title| |How to...| |Templates|Pagelog}}

Simple, practical instructions or check lists for basic tasks.

==Start a new page==

If you are starting a new page in the course, please follow these steps before doing anything else. Details on how to carry out each step is given in the subsections below.

#Please list yourself as on the [[../Contributors|Authors and contributors]] page (unless you already have).
#Register the page on the [[../History#New page log|New page log]] (located on the Project History page).
#Place the page in the [[../Contents|Table of contents]] page (unless it's already there).
#Open/create the new page, and place standard navigation links, course logo and page title at the top using the Template:Miskito_title template (you will need to set its parameters).

===What you need to decide in order to begin===

Decide the following first:
*the page's '''name''': This is the name used by the system, and will consist of ''Miskito/'' followed by one or more words, e.g. ''Miskito/Lesson 34'', ''Miskito/Links'', ''Miskito/Grammar notes''.
*the page's '''title''': This is the heading appearing at the top of the page (with the course logo) and also in the table of contents and on some other pages, e.g. the title of the ''Miskito/Links'' page is '''Miskito links and bibliography''', and that of ''Miskito/Lesson 1'' is '''Nini Mary sa'''.
*the page's '''position''' in the course's page sequence and the table of contents (i.e. between which two existing pages you will place the new page).

Once you have decided these three things, you are ready to do the following.

===Register the page on the new page log===

Go to [[../History#New page log|New page log]], open the edit window of the section, scroll down to the bottom of the list and add a new line with the new page's data, following the instructions given on that page.
*If the new page's name is ''Miskito/AAA'' and its title will be ''BBB'', then register the page by writing the following line at the bottom of the list:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{miskito_new_page_log|AAA|BBB|--~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
This will create an entry looking like this:
{{miskito_new_page_log|AAA|BBB|--[[User:A R King|A R King]] 21:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC)}}
(''Note:'' If you find this confusing, you may find it easier to use the preceding entry on the page as a model and just replace the data as necessary.)

You can now open the new page by clicking on the link your entry has created. However, before doing that, please add the page to the course's table of contents first so that readers can see it is there...

===Place the page in the table of contents===

(If the page you are creating is already listed in the table of contents, skip this step.)

Open the course's [[../Contents|Table of contents]] and after studying the course's organisation (if you haven't already done this), decide where the new page will go. Now edit the entry for the new page into appropriate section of the table of contents. To do this:
*'''If the new page is ''not'' a lesson''', and if as before the new page's name is ''Miskito/AAA'' and its title will be ''BBB'', then write the following line at the relevant position in the list of chapters:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{miskito_chapter|AAA|BBB|
}} {{stage short|00%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
This will create an entry on the table of contents page looking like this:
{{miskito_chapter|AAA|BBB|
}} {{stage short|00%}}
*'''If the new page is ''not'' a numbered lesson''', supposing the new lesson is ''Lesson N'' (where N is a number), the title (a Miskito sentence) is ''BBB'', and the English translation of the title is ''CCC'', then insert the following line at the relevant position in the list of lessons:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{miskito_lesson|N|BBB|CCC| 
 }} {{stage short|00%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
This will automatically generate the following entry:
{{miskito_lesson|N|BBB|CCC| 
}} {{stage short|00%}}

(''Note:'' If you find this confusing, you may find it easier to use the preceding entry on the page as a model and just replace the data as necessary.)

===Create the page===

*Click on either of the two links your entries have already generated (in the table of contents or the new page log) to open up an editing window for the new page.
*Insert standard navigation links, the course logo and the page's title at the top of the page. This is much easier than it sounds... 
*If it is '''not a lesson''' and the page's title is ''BBB'', and the '''names''' of the preceding and following chapters' pages are ''Miskito/XXX'' and ''Miskito/YYY'' respectively, then just write the following at the top of the new page:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{miskito_title| |BBB| |XXX|YYY}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The result at the top of the new page will look like this:
{{miskito_title| |BBB| |XXX|YYY}}
*'''If it is a lesson''', then suppose the number of the lesson is N, BBB is its Miskito title and CCC its English translation, M is the preceding lesson number and O the following lesson number. Then you write this at the top of the page:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{miskito_title|N|BBB|CCC|Lesson M|Lesson O}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
which will generate the following:
{{miskito_title|N|BBB|CCC|Lesson M|Lesson O}}
(''Note:'' If you find this confusing, you may find it easier to open another page (a chapter of a lesson as the case may be) and taking its top line as a model, just replace the data as necessary.)
*Now save the page, and you are ready to open it again and start placing some content there.

==Write a point==

A standard lesson consists of several &quot;points&quot; followed by a vocabulary and review activity. Each point consists of model sentences, commentary and a practice exercise. For details on these elements, please read other pages such as [[../Lesson structure|Lesson Structure]] and [[../Layout|the Layout Guide]].

[[../Notebook#DUMMY_POINT|'''Here''']] is a dummy &quot;point&quot; which you may wish to copy and use as a starter when writing up each point in a lesson. To use this, open up the section (DUMMY POINT) in edit mode (click on the Edit link on the right), copy everything in the edit window, then paste it into your lesson page. Flesh out the content, putting your material in place of the items IN CAPITAL LETTERS. Where there are three of something, you can have any number you like of them.



==Write a vocabulary/review section==

Again, other pages give details on how to write this section. [[../Notebook#Vocabulary_and_review|'''Here''']] is a dummy section to help in writing up lessons. To use it, open up the section (&quot;Vocabulary and review&quot;) in edit mode (click on the Edit link on the right), copy everything in the edit window, then paste it into your lesson page. Flesh out the content, putting your material in place of the items IN CAPITAL LETTERS. Where there are three of something, you can have any number you like of them, of course.

Once you have decided on the full content of the lesson's vocabulary, you should incorporate it into the [[../Vocabulary (Miskito)|general vocabulary]] page. While this is not an automatic process, it is quite easy and some of the steps can be performed semi-automatically, i.e. using computer tools to make it easier. The steps are as follows:
#Open the [[../Wordlist|word list page]] (NOT the general vocabulary page just mentioned, which should not be edited directly). This is where the complete vocabulary is stored in alphabetic order; open its editing window.
#Copy and paste the entire existing contents of the editing window (Ctrl-A) to a Microsoft Word file (or any other programme capable of alphabetically sorting a list). There's no need to save the file, just keep the window open.
#Now open in another window the new vocabulary section you are incorporating, again in edit mode, and copy and paste the list of vocabulary items there appending it at the end of (or anywhere else you like, actually) the word document you have temporarily created. (Note: you may take the column-separator lines as well if you like: &lt;nowiki&gt;(&quot; | width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;| &quot;).&lt;/nowiki&gt; If so, no problem, just delete them again after you do the sort.)
#Now select the whole list in your word processor page and sort it alphabetically. (On my computer this is done from the Table menu, even though there's no need to make a table for it to work!) If the column separators are there, delete them now.
#Copy and paste the whole page back into the editing window of the course's general word list window, replacing the previous version of the list, and save.</text>

'''Welsh''' (''{{lang|cy|Cymraeg}}'' or ''{{lang|cy|y Gymraeg}}'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] {{IPA|[kəmˈrɑːɨɡ]}}, {{IPA|[ə ɡəmˈrɑːɨɡ]}}), is a member of the [[Brythonic]] branch of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] spoken natively in [[Wales]] (''Cymru''), in [[England]] by some along the Welsh border, and in the [[Welsh settlement in Argentina|Welsh immigrant colony]] in the [[Chubut Valley]], in [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Patagonia]].

There are also speakers of Welsh throughout the world, most notably in the rest of [[Great Britain]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].

Due to the increasing use of the [[English language]] the numbers of Welsh speakers had been declining for decades.  However, following a number of measures, including the introduction of the [[Welsh Language Act 1993]], Welsh has enjoyed a strong revival in recent years and has an equal status with English in the public sector in Wales.  It is the most spoken Celtic language.

See [[Welsh English]] for the [[English language]] as spoken in Wales.

==Status==

[[image:wales.cardiff.slow.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|Bilingual road markings in Wales]]

The 2004 Welsh Language Use Survey shows 21.7% of the population of Wales are Welsh speakers. This is an increase from 20.5% in the [[Census 2001|2001 census]], and from 18.5% in 1991.  The 2001 census also shows that about 25% of Welsh residents were born outside Wales.  The number of Welsh speakers in the rest of Britain is unknown.   In [[1993]], [[S4C]], the Welsh-language TV channel published the results of a
survey into the numbers of people who speak or understand Welsh, and this estimated that there were some 133,000 Welsh-speakers living in [[England]], about 50,000 of them in the [[Greater London]] area and border towns and villages in the Welsh Marches such as [[Oswestry]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/archives/welsh-l/welsh-l/1993/Mar/More-Welsh-Speakers Summary of 1993 S4C survey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh, but [[monoglot]] Welsh speakers are now virtually non-existent. Almost without exception, Welsh speakers also speak English (or, among those in [[Chubut Province]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).  However, a large number of Welsh speakers are more comfortable expressing themselves in Welsh than in English.  A speaker's choice of language can vary according to the subject domain and the social context (known in linguistics as [[code-switching]]).

Although Welsh is a minority language, support for the language grew during the second half of the [[20th century]], along with the rise of organisations such as the [[Welsh nationalism|nationalist]] political party [[Plaid Cymru]] and the Welsh Language Society, [[Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg]].

Welsh as a first language is largely concentrated in the less urban north and west of Wales, principally [[Gwynedd]], [[Denbighshire]] (''{{lang|cy|Sir Ddinbych}}''), [[Anglesey]] (''{{lang|cy|Ynys Môn}}''), [[Carmarthenshire]] (''{{lang|cy|Sir Gaerfyrddin}}''), north [[Pembrokeshire]] (''{{lang|cy|Sir Benfro}}''), [[Ceredigion]], parts of west [[Glamorgan]] (''{{lang|cy|Morgannwg}}''), north-west and extreme south-west [[Powys]], although first-language and other fluent speakers can be found throughout Wales.

[[Image:CallaghanSquareSignCardiffCaerdydd200507 CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|Bilingual road sign in [[Cardiff]].]]

Welsh is a [[living language]], used in conversation by thousands and seen throughout Wales. The [[Welsh Language Act 1993]] and the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]] provide that the Welsh and English languages should be treated equally.  Public bodies are required to prepare and implement a Welsh Language Scheme.  Local councils and the [[Welsh Assembly]] use Welsh  as an official language, issuing official literature and publicity in Welsh versions (e.g. letters to parents from schools, library information, and council information) and all road signs in Wales should be in English and Welsh, including the Welsh versions of place names.  The teaching of Welsh is now compulsory in all schools in Wales up to age 16, and this has had a major effect in stabilising and to some extent reversing the decline in the language.  It means, for example, that even the children of English monoglot migrants to Wales grow up with  a knowledge of the language.  However, the vast majority of people in the main population centres of South Wales do not use the language in daily life.

The UK government has ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in respect to Welsh.

The language has greatly increased its prominence since the creation of the television channel [[S4C]] in November [[1982]], which broadcasts exclusively in Welsh during peak viewing hours. The main evening television news provided by the [[BBC]] in Welsh is  [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/live/newyddion.ram available for download] (Real Media).

Since December [[2001]] the British Government has planned to ensure that all immigrants know [[English language|English]]. It remains to be seen if Welsh will be considered a separate case. At present, a knowledge of either Welsh, English or [[Scottish Gaelic]] is sufficient for [[naturalisation]] purposes and it is believed that this policy will be continued in any proposed changes to the law.

Like most languages, there are identifiable periods within the history of Welsh, although the boundaries between these are often indistinct. 

===Old Welsh===
The earliest extant sources of a language identifiable as Welsh go back to about the 6th century, and the language of this period is known as ''Early Welsh''. Very little of this language remains.  The next main period, somewhat better attested, is [[Old Welsh language|Old Welsh]] (''{{lang|cy|Hen Gymraeg}}'') ([[9th century|9th]] to [[11th century|11th]] centuries); [[poetry]] from both Wales and [[Scotland]] has been preserved in this form of the language.  As [[Anglo-Saxons|Germanic]] and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] colonisation of Great Britain proceeded, the Brythonic speakers in Wales were split off from those in northern England, speaking [[Cumbrian language|Cumbrian]], and those in the south-west, speaking what would become [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and so the languages diverged. Both ''Canu Aneirin'' and ''Canu Taliesin'' were in this era.

===Middle Welsh===
''[[Middle Welsh language|Middle Welsh]]'' (or ''{{lang|cy|Cymraeg Canol}}'') is the label attached to the Welsh of the [[12th century|12th]] to [[14th century|14th]] centuries, of which much more remains than for any earlier period. This is the language of nearly all surviving early manuscripts of the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', although the tales themselves are certainly much older. It is also the language of the existing [[Welsh law]] manuscripts.  Middle Welsh is reasonably intelligible, albeit with some work, to a modern-day Welsh speaker.

===Modern Welsh===
Modern Welsh can be divided into two periods. The first, ''Early Modern Welsh'' ran from the [[14th century]] to roughly the end of the [[16th century]] and was the language used by [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]]. 

====Late Modern Welsh====
''Late Modern Welsh'' began with the publication of [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]]'s [[Welsh Bible|translation of the Bible]] in [[1588]]. Like its English counterpart, the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]], this proved to have a strong stabilising effect on the language, and indeed the language today still bears the same ''Late Modern'' label as Morgan's language. Of course, many minor changes have occurred since then.

====19th century====
The language enjoyed a further boost in the [[19th century]], with the publication of some of the first complete and concise Welsh [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. Early work by Welsh [[lexicography|lexicographic]] pioneers such as [[Daniel Silvan Evans]] ensured that the language was documented as accurately as possible, and modern dictionaries such as the ''{{lang|cy|[[Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru]]}}'' (the [[University of Wales]] Dictionary), are direct descendants of these dictionaries.

However, the influx of English workers during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Wales from about [[1800]] led to a substantial dilution of the Welsh-speaking population of Wales.  English migrants seldom learnt Welsh and their Welsh colleagues tended to speak English in mixed Welsh–English contexts, and bilingualism became almost universal. The legal status of Welsh was inferior to that of English, and so English gradually came to prevail, except in the most rural areas, particularly in north west and mid Wales.  An important exception, however, was in the [[non-conformist]] churches, which were strongly associated with the Welsh language.

====20th and 21st centuries====
By the twentieth century, the numbers of Welsh speakers were shrinking at a rate which suggested that it would be extinct within a few generations. The 10-yearly [[census]] first started to ask language questions in [[1891]], by which time 54% of the population still spoke Welsh. The percentage fell with every subsequent census, until reaching an all-time low in [[1981]] (19%). In [[1991]] the position was stable (19% as in 1981) and in the most recent census, [[as of 2001|2001]], it has risen to 21% able to speak Welsh. The [[Census 2001|2001 census]] also recorded that 20% could read Welsh, 18% could write Welsh, and 24% could understand Welsh. Furthermore, the highest proportion of Welsh speakers was among young people, which bodes well for the future of Welsh. In 2001, 39% of children aged 10 to 15 were able to speak, read and write Welsh (many of them having learned it in school), compared with 25% of 16 to 19 year olds. However, the percentage of Welsh speakers in areas where Welsh is spoken by the majority is still in decline.

It seems that the rise of [[Welsh nationalism]] rallied supporters of the language, and the establishment of Welsh television and radio found a mass audience which was encouraged in the retention of its Welsh. Perhaps most important of all, at the end of the twentieth century it became compulsory for all school children to learn Welsh up to age 16, and this both reinforced the language in Welsh-speaking areas and reintroduced at least an elementary knowledge of it in areas which had become more or less wholly Anglophone. The decline in the percentage of people in Wales who can speak Welsh has now been halted, and there are even signs of a modest recovery. However, although Welsh is the daily language in many parts of Wales, English is almost universally understood.

==Orthography==
{{main|Welsh alphabet}}

Welsh is written in a version of the [[Latin alphabet]] consisting of 28 letters, of which eight are [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s treated as single letters for [[collation]]:

: a, b, c, ch, d, dd, e, f, ff, g, ng, h, i, l, ll, m, n, o, p, ph, r, rh, s, t, th, u, w, y

The letters ''j'' and ''v'', although not originally used to write Welsh, have been borrowed from the [[English alphabet]], and are most commonly used only within names, although there are a few exceptions.

The most common [[diacritic]] is the [[circumflex]], which is used in some cases to mark a [[vowel length|long vowel]].

===Phonology===
====Consonants====
Welsh has the following [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s:

{{IPA|/z/}} occurs only in unassimilated [[loanword]]s.  {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} occur mainly in loanwords, but also in some dialects as developments from {{IPA|/tj/}} and {{IPA|/dj/}}; the [[voiceless consonant|voiceless]] [[nasal consonant|nasals]] {{IPA|/m̥/}}, {{IPA|/n̥/}}, {{IPA|/ŋ̊/}} occur only as a consequence of [[Welsh morphology#Initial consonant mutation|nasal mutation]].

====Vowels====

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! [[Monophthong]]s

| align=center | {{IPA|uː}}
|-
| '''[[Near-close vowel|Near-close]]'''

|}

The vowels {{IPA|/ɨ̞/}} and {{IPA|/ɨː/}} occur only in Northern dialects; in Southern dialects they are replaced by {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/iː/}} respectively. In Southern dialects, the contrast between long and short vowels is found in stressed [[syllable]]s only; in Northern dialects, the contrast is found only in stressed ''word-final'' syllables (including monosyllabic words).

The vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} does not occur in the final syllable of words (except a few monosyllables).

| align=center | {{IPA|ai}}
| align=center | {{IPA|aɨ, ɑːɨ}}
| align=center | {{IPA|au}}
|}

The diphthongs containing {{IPA|/ɨ/}} occur only in Northern dialects; in Southern dialects {{IPA|/ʊɨ/}} is replaced by {{IPA|/ʊi/}}, {{IPA|/ɨu, əɨ, ɔɨ/}} are merged with {{IPA|/ɪu, əi, ɔi/}}, and {{IPA|/aɨ, ɑːɨ/}} are merged with {{IPA|/ai/}}.

====Stress====
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] in polysyllabic words occurs most commonly on the [[wikt:penultimate|penultimate]] [[syllable]], more rarely on the final syllable.

The positioning of the stress means that related words or concepts (or even [[plural]]s) can sound quite different, as syllables are added to the end of a word and the stress moves correspondingly, e.g.:
: ''{{lang|cy|ysgrif}}'' — {{IPA|/ˈəsgriv/}} — an article or essay
: ''{{lang|cy|ysgrifen}}'' — {{IPA|/əsˈgriven/}} — writing
: ''{{lang|cy|ysgrifennydd}}'' — {{IPA|/əsgriˈvenɨð/}} — a secretary
: ''{{lang|cy|ysgrifenyddes}}'' — {{IPA|/əsgriveˈnəðes/}} — a female secretary

(Note also how adding a syllable to ''{{lang|cy|ysgrifennydd}}'' to form ''{{lang|cy|ysgrifenyddes}}'' changes the pronunciation of the second &quot;y&quot;. This is because the pronunciation of &quot;y&quot; depends on whether or not it is in the final syllable.)

The connection between the Welsh word ''{{lang|cy|ysgrif}}'' and the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''{{lang|la|scribo}}'' &quot;I write&quot;, from which it is derived, is fairly clear, taking [[Historical linguistics|diachronic sound shifts]] into account.

===Morphology===
{{main|Welsh morphology}}

Welsh [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] has much in common with that of the other modern [[Insular Celtic languages]], such as the use of initial [[consonant mutation]]s, and the use of so-called &quot;conjugated prepositions&quot; ([[preposition]]s that fuse with the personal [[pronoun]]s that are their [[object (grammar)|object]]). Welsh [[noun]]s belong to one of two [[grammatical gender]]s, masculine and feminine, but are not inflected for [[declension|case]]. Welsh has a variety of different endings to indicate the [[plural]], and two endings to indicate the [[grammatical number|singular]] of some nouns. In spoken Welsh, [[verb]] inflection is indicated primarily by the use of [[auxiliary verb]]s, rather than by the inflection of the main verb. In literary Welsh, on the other hand, inflection of the main verb is usual.

=== Other features of Welsh grammar ===
====Possessives as object pronouns==== 
The Welsh for &quot;I like Rhodri&quot; is &quot;''{{lang|cy|Dw i'n hoffi Rhodri}}''&quot; (&quot;I am liking [of] Rhodri&quot;), but &quot;I like ''him''&quot; is &quot;''{{lang|cy|Dw i'n '''ei''' hoffi fe}}''&quot; — literally, &quot;I am ''his'' liking him&quot;; &quot;I like ''you''&quot; is &quot;''{{lang|cy|Dw i'n '''dy''' hoffi di}}''&quot; (&quot;I am ''your'' liking you&quot;), etc.

====Significant use of auxiliary verbs====
While English can either use verbs directly (e.g. &quot;I go&quot;) or with the aid of an [[auxiliary verb]] (&quot;I am going&quot;, here using &quot;to be&quot; as the auxiliary), non-literary Welsh inclines very strongly towards the latter use. In the [[present tense]], all verbs are used with the auxiliary &quot;''{{lang|cy|bod}}''&quot; (to be), so &quot;''{{lang|cy|dw i'n mynd}}''&quot; is literally &quot;I am going&quot;, but also means simply &quot;I go&quot;. In the [[past tense|past]] and [[future tense|future]] tenses, there are [[inflected language|inflected]] forms of all verbs (which are invariably used in the written language), but it is more common nowadays in speech to use the [[verbal noun]] (''{{lang|cy|berfenw}}'', loosely equal to the [[infinitive]] in English) together with the inflected form of &quot;''{{lang|cy|gwneud}}''&quot; (to do), so &quot;I went&quot; can be &quot;''{{lang|cy|mi es i}}''&quot; or &quot;''{{lang|cy|mi wnes i fynd}}''&quot; and &quot;I will go&quot; can be &quot;''{{lang|cy|mi a' i}}''&quot; or &quot;''{{lang|cy|mi wna i fynd}}''&quot;. There is also a future form using the auxiliary ''{{lang|cy|bod}}'', giving &quot;''{{lang|cy|fydda i'n mynd}}''&quot; (perhaps best translated as &quot;I will be going&quot;) and an [[imperfect tense]] (a continuous/habitual past tense) also using &quot;''{{lang|cy|bod}}''&quot;, with &quot;''{{lang|cy|roeddwn i'n mynd}}''&quot; meaning &quot;I used to go/I was going&quot;.

====Affirmative markers====
''{{lang|cy|Mi}}'' or  ''{{lang|cy|fe}}'' is often placed before inflected verbs to show that they are declarative. In the present and imperfect of the verb ''{{lang|cy|bod}}'' (to be), ''{{lang|cy|yr}}'' is used instead.  ''Mi'' is mainly restricted to colloquial Northern Welsh, with ''fe'' predominating in the South and in the formal or literary register.  Such marking of the declarative is, in any case, rather less common in higher registers.

== Counting system ==
The traditional counting system used by the Welsh language is [[vigesimal]], i.e. based on twenties, as in [[French language|French]] numbers 80-99, where numbers from 11–14 are &quot;''x'' on ten&quot;, 16–19 are &quot;''x'' on fifteen&quot; (though 18 is more usually &quot;two nines&quot;); numbers from 21–39 are &quot;1–19 on twenty&quot;, 40 is &quot;two twenties&quot;, 60 is &quot;three twenties&quot;, etc.

There is also a decimal counting system, favoured by younger people, more common in South Wales, and which appears to be commonly used in Patagonian Welsh, where numbers are &quot;''x'' tens ''y''&quot;, e.g. thirty-five in decimal is ''{{lang|cy|tri deg pump}}'' (three ten five) while in vigesimal it is ''{{lang|cy|pymtheg ar hugain}}'' (fifteen – itself &quot;five-ten&quot; – on twenty).

A further complication is that while there is only one word for &quot;one&quot; (''{{lang|cy|un}}'') there are masculine and feminine forms of the numbers &quot;two&quot; (''{{lang|cy|dau}}'' and ''{{lang|cy|dwy}}''), &quot;three&quot; (''{{lang|cy|tri}}'' and ''{{lang|cy|tair}}'') and &quot;four&quot; (''{{lang|cy|pedwar}}'' and ''{{lang|cy|pedair}}''), which must agree with the [[grammatical gender]] of the objects being counted, though this rule is less strictly observed with the decimal counting system.

* The words ''{{lang|cy|deg}}'' (ten), ''{{lang|cy|deuddeg}}'' (twelve) and ''{{lang|cy|pymtheg}}'' (fifteen) often become ''{{lang|cy|deng}}'', ''{{lang|cy|deuddeng}}'' and ''{{lang|cy|pymtheng}}'' respectively when before a word beginning with &quot;m&quot;, e.g. ''{{lang|cy|deng munud}}'' (ten minutes), ''{{lang|cy|deuddeng milltir}}'' (twelve miles), ''{{lang|cy|pymtheng mlynedd}}'' (fifteen years).

* The numbers ''{{lang|cy|pump}}'' (five), ''{{lang|cy|chwech}}'' (six) and ''{{lang|cy|cant}}'' (hundred) drop the final consonant when they stand immediately in front of a noun, e.g. ''{{lang|cy|pum potel}}'' (five bottles), ''{{lang|cy|chwe llwy}}'' (six spoons), ''{{lang|cy|can punt}}'' (a hundred pounds).

* Larger numbers tend to use the decimal system, e.g. 1,965 ''{{lang|cy|mil, naw cant chwe deg pump}}''. An exception to this rule is when referring to years, where after the number of thousands, the individual digits are spoken, e.g. 1965 ''{{lang|cy|mil naw chwe(ch) pump}}''. This system appears to have broken down for years after 2000, e.g. 2005 is ''{{lang|cy|dwy fil a phump}}''.

* The number ''miliwn'' is feminine, and ''biliwn'' is masculine.  It is necessary for the gender of these to be different as they can both mutate to ''filiwn''.  Two million is therefore ''dwy filiwn'', and two billion is ''dau filiwn''.

==Dialects==
[[Dialect]]ical differences are very evident in the spoken, and to a lesser extent the written, language. A convenient, if slightly simplistic, classification is into ''North Walian'' and ''South Walian'' forms (or &quot;''{{lang|cy|Gog}}''&quot; and &quot;''{{lang|cy|Hwntw}}''&quot; based on the word for North, ''{{lang|cy|gogledd}}'', and the South Walian word for &quot;them over there&quot;). The differences between dialects encompass vocabulary, pronunciation and grammar, although particularly in the last regard the differences are in fact relatively minor. Much more fine-grained classifications exist beyond north and south: the book ''{{lang|cy|Cymraeg, Cymrâg, Cymrêg: cyflwyno'r tafodieithoedd}}'',&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, B. and Thomas, P. W. ''{{lang|cy|Cymraeg, Cymrâg, Cymrêg: cyflwyno'r tafodieithoedd}}'', published by Gwasg Taf, ISBN 0-948469-14-5. Out of print&lt;/ref&gt; about Welsh dialects was accompanied by a cassette containing recordings of fourteen different speakers demonstrating aspects of different dialects. The book refers to the earlier ''Linguistic Geography of Wales''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, A. R. [[1973]] ''Linguistic Geography of Wales''&lt;/ref&gt; as describing six different regions which could be identified as having words specific to those regions.

Another dialect is [[Patagonian Welsh]], which has developed since the start of the [[Welsh settlement in Argentina]] in [[1865]]; it includes [[Spanish language|Spanish]] loanwords and terms for local features.

An example of the difference between North and South Walian usage would be the question &quot;Do you want a cup of tea?&quot; In the North this would typically be &quot;''{{lang|cy|Dach chi isio panad?}}''&quot;, while in the South the question &quot;''{{lang|cy|Dych chi moyn dishgled?}}''&quot; would be more likely. An example of a pronunciation difference between Northern and Southern Welsh is the tendency of Southern dialects to &quot;lisp&quot; the letter &quot;s&quot;, e.g. ''{{lang|cy|mis}}'' (month), would tend to be pronounced {{IPA|[miːs]}} in the north, and {{IPA|[miːʃ]}} in the south.

In fact, the difference between dialects of modern spoken Welsh pale into insignificance compared to the difference between the spoken and literary languages. The latter is significantly more formal and is the language of [[Welsh Bible|Welsh translations]] of the [[Bible]], amongst other things (although the ''{{lang|cy|Beibl Cymraeg Newydd}}'' — New Welsh Bible — is significantly less formal than the traditional [[1588]] [[Bible]]). Gareth King, author of a Welsh grammar, observes that &quot;The difference between these two is much greater than between the virtually identical colloquial and literary forms of English&quot; and goes so far as to state &quot;that there are good grounds for regarding them as separate languages&quot;.  He comments that whilst colloquial Welsh is a mother tongue requiring no special learning to acquire, literary Welsh is the mother tongue of no-one, and must be taught to people.&lt;ref&gt;King, G. ''Modern Welsh: a comprehensive grammar'', published by Routledge, ISBN 0-415-09269-8 p3&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the question &quot;Do you want a cup of tea?&quot; is not likely to occur in literary Welsh usage, if it did it would be along the lines of &quot;''{{lang|cy|A oes arnoch eisiau cwpanaid o de?}}''&quot;

Amongst the characteristics of the literary, as against the spoken, language are a higher dependence on inflected verb forms, a shift in the usage of some of the tenses, a reduction in the explicit use of pronouns (since the information is usually conveyed in the verb/preposition inflections) and a greatly reduced tendency to substitute [[English language|English]] loanwords for native Welsh words.

==Diglossia: Literary vs. Colloquial Welsh==
Modern Welsh can be written in two varieties - '''Colloquial Welsh''' (''Cymraeg llafar'') or '''Literary Welsh''' (''Cymraeg llenyddol''). The grammar described on this page is that of Colloquial Welsh, which is used for speech and informal writing.  Literary Welsh is closer to the form of Welsh used in the 1588 translation of the Bible and is found in official documents and other formal [[Register (linguistics)|registers]], including much literature.  As a standardised form, literary Welsh shows little if any of the dialectal variation found in colloquial Welsh.

Some differences include

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Literary Welsh
! Colloquial Welsh
|-
| Can omit subject pronouns ([[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]])
| Subject pronouns rarely omitted
|-
| Extensive use of simple verb forms
| Extensive use of periphrastic verb forms
|-
| No distinction between simple present and future (e.g. ''gwelaf'' &quot;I see&quot;/&quot;I shall see&quot;)
| Simple form expresses only future (e.g. ''gwela i'' &quot;I'll see&quot;) 
|-
| Subjunctive verb forms
| Subjunctive in fixed idioms
|-
| 3rd.pl ending = ''–nt''
| 3rd.pl ending = ''–n''
|}

In addition, more archaic pronouns and forms of mutation may be observed in Literary Welsh. A complete grammar of Literary Welsh can be found in ''A Grammar of Welsh'' (1980) by Stephen J. Williams.

Currently, most Welsh writing, especially that found on the Internet or in magazines, is closer to the '''Colloquial''' form.  This is also becoming more common in artistic literature.

===Examples of sentences in literary and colloquial Welsh===

==Welsh in education==
The decade around [[1840]] was a period of great social upheaval in Wales, manifested in the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, which culminated in 20,000 people marching on [[Newport]] in [[1839]] resulting in a [[riot]] when 20 people were killed by soldiers defending the Westgate Hotel, and the [[Rebecca Riots]] when [[tollbooth]]s on [[turnpikes]] were systematically destroyed. This unrest brought the state of education in Wales to the attention of the English establishment, as social reformers of the time considered education as a means of dealing with social ills. ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper was prominent among those who considered that the lack of education of the Welsh people was the root cause of most of the problems, although the population was generally literate in Welsh because of the activities of [[Sunday School]]s and the need to read the Bible. In July [[1846]], three commissioners, R. R. W. Lingen, Jellynger C. Symons and H. R. Vaughan Johnson, were appointed to inquire into the state of education in Wales; the Commissioners were all [[Anglican]]s, and hence unsympathetic to the Non-conformist majority in Wales, and were monoglot English-speakers.

The Commissioners presented their report to the Government on [[1 July]] [[1847]] in three large blue-bound volumes. This report quickly became known as ''{{lang|cy|Brad y Llyfrau Gleision}}'' (The [[Treachery of the Blue Books]]) as, apart from documenting the state of education in Wales, the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language, Non-conformity, and the morals of the Welsh people in general. An immediate effect of the report was for a belief to take root in the minds of ordinary people that the only way for Welsh people to get on in the world was through the medium of English, and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated. The historian Professor [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as &quot;the [[Massacre of Glencoe|Glencoe]] and the [[Amritsar massacre|Amritsar]] of Welsh history&quot;.

In the later [[19th century]] virtually all teaching in the schools of Wales was in English, even in areas where the pupils barely understood English. Some schools used the [[Welsh Not]], a piece of wood, often bearing the letters &quot;WN&quot;, which was hung around the neck of any pupil caught speaking Welsh. The pupil could pass it on to any schoolmate heard speaking Welsh, with the pupil wearing it at the end of the day being given a beating. Towards the beginning of the 20th century this policy slowly began to change, partly owing to the efforts of [[Owen Morgan Edwards]] when he became chief inspector of schools for Wales in [[1907]].

The [[Aberystwyth]] Welsh School (''{{lang|cy|Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth}}'') was founded in [[1939]] by Sir Ifan ap Owen Edwards, the son of O.M. Edwards as the first Welsh Primary School. The headteacher was Norah Isaac. {{lang|cy|Ysgol Gymraeg}} is still a very successful school and now there are Welsh language primary schools all over the country. Ysgol Glan Clwyd was established in [[Rhyl]] in [[1955]] as the first Welsh language school to teach to a secondary level. 

Welsh is now widely used in [[education]].  All Welsh universities teach some courses in Welsh (most notably the [[University of Wales, Bangor]] and the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]]) but are primarily English language. Under the [[National Curriculum]], [[Education in Wales|schoolchildren in Wales]] must study Welsh up to the age of 16.  Over a quarter of children in Wales attend schools which teach predominantly through the medium of Welsh. &lt;ref&gt;Figures for 2002-03: [http://www.bwrdd-yr-iaith.org.uk/cynnwys.php?pID=219&amp;langID=2 ''Welsh medium or bilingual provision''], [[Welsh Language Board]]&lt;/ref&gt;. The remainder study Welsh as a second language in English-medium schools.  Specialist teachers of Welsh called ''{{lang|cy|Athrawon Bro}}'' support the teaching of Welsh in the National Curriculum.

==Welsh in information technology==
Welsh has a substantial presence on the Internet, ranging from formal lists of terminology in a variety of fields &lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.e-gymraeg.org/bwrdd-yr-iaith/termau/default.aspx?lang=en Welsh National Database of Standardised Terminology] was [http://www.bwrdd-yr-iaith.org.uk/cynnwys.php?pID=241&amp;langID=2&amp;nID=640 released in March 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; to Welsh language interfaces for parts of [[Microsoft Windows XP]], a variety of [[Linux distribution]]s, and some online services to [[blog]]s kept in Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;Selections of Welsh-language blogs are listed on the sites  [http://rhithfro.com Y Rhithfro] and [http://blogiadur.com Blogiadur].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welsh in warfare==
Secure communications are often difficult to achieve in wartime.  [[Cryptography]] can be used to protect messages, but codes can be broken. Therefore, little-known languages are sometimes encoded, so that even if the code is broken, the message is still in a language few people know. For example, [[Navajo language|Navajo]] [[code talker]]s were used by the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] during [[World War II]]. Similarly, the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], a Welsh regiment serving in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], used Welsh for emergency communications that needed to be secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Heath | first = Tony | title = Welsh speak up for their ancient tongue|work = [[The Independent]] | pages = 6 | date = 1996-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1982 [[Falklands War]] between [[Argentina]] and the United Kingdom, there were stories of British soldiers speaking Welsh with captured Argentinian soldiers who were descendants of [[Welsh settlement in Argentina|Welsh immigrants to the Chubut Valley]] in [[Patagonia]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Welsh in popular culture==
In the summer of 2006, [[List of Big Brother 2006 housemates (UK)#Glyn|Glyn Wise]] and [[List of Big Brother 2006 housemates (UK)#Imogen|Imogen Thomas]] entered the [[Big Brother UK|Big Brother house]]. These were two fluent Welsh speakers and regularly spoke to each other through the Welsh language. This increased the awareness of the Welsh language dramatically in young people.

Welcome to the first basic lesson of Hebrew! In this lesson we're going to learn some basic greetings and basic grammatical features of Hebrew. First read the following dialogue and do the exercise related to it.

==Dialogue==
Two strangers, Sarah ({{Hebrew|שָׂרָה}}) and David ({{Hebrew|דָּוִד}}), meet each other in one of the many cafés of Tel Aviv. The following conversation takes place:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;
{{Hebrew|
'''דָּוִד:''' שָׁלוֹם! קוֹרְאִים לִי דָּוִד. אֵיך קוֹרְאִים לָךְ?&lt;br&gt;
'''שָׂרָה:''' שָׁלוֹם, דָּוִד. לִי קוֹרְאִים שָׂרָה. מָה שְׁלוֹמְךָ?&lt;br&gt;
'''דָּוִד:''' טוֹב, תּוֹדָה. מָה נִשְׁמַע?&lt;br&gt;
'''שָׂרָה:''' בְּסֵדֶר. שָׁלוֹם, דָּוִד.&lt;br&gt;
'''דָּוִד:''' לְהִתְרָאוֹת!&lt;br&gt;
}}
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

{{Question-answer
| question = Transliterate the dialogue.
| answer = '''David:''' Shalom! Qor’im li David. Ekh qor’im lakh? &lt;br&gt;
'''Sarah:''' Shalom, David. Li qor’im Sarah. Ma shlomkha? &lt;br&gt;
'''David:''' Tov, todah. Mah nishma‘?&lt;br&gt;
'''Sarah:''' Beseder. Shalom, David.&lt;br&gt;
'''David:''' Lehitra’ot.
}}

==Greetings==

{|  {{Hebrew table|Vocabulary|?אֵיך קוֹרְאִים לך|Hello!|!שָׁלוֹם|2}}
! English
! עִבְרִית
|-
| Hello!
| rowspan=2 | {{Hebrew|שָׁלוֹם!}} ''m''
|-
| Goodbye!
|-
| Hi!
| {{Hebrew|הַיִי!}}
|-
| Bye!
| {{Hebrew|בַּיִי!}}
|-
| See you later!
| {{Hebrew|לְהִתְרָאוֹת!}}
|-
| Thank you
| {{Hebrew|תּוֹדָה}} ''f''
|-
| OK/Fine
| {{Hebrew|בְּסֵדֶר°}}
|-
| Good/Well
| {{Hebrew|טוֹב}}
|}
Words marked with ° have their accent falling on their penultimate syllable, as in ''bóqer''. In all other cases, the accent will fall on the last syllable.

==Asking for Names==
{{Hebrew|אֵיך קוֹרְאִים לְךָ?}} and {{Hebrew|אֵיך קוֹרְאִים לָךְ?}} both mean “what's your name?” (lit. “how [do] they-call to-you?”). One is directed to a male ({{Hebrew|לְךָ}}) and one to a female ({{Hebrew|לָךְ}}). Therefore, when asking a male for his name, say the former, and when asking female for her name, use the latter.

You may respond by saying your name, or, if you want to introduce yourself, saying {{Hebrew|קוֹרְאִים לִי...}} (lit. “they-call to-me...”)&lt;ref&gt;In the dialogue Sarah switched the {{Hebrew|קוֹרְאִים}} (qor'im) and {{Hebrew|לִי}} (li) (she said {{Hebrew|לִי קוֹרְאִים שָׂרָה.}} (''Li qor'im Sarah''). She said it in this fashion to contrast between David's question and her response. In other words, it was as if she was saying: “Your name is David? Well, ''my'' name is Sarah”. Note the emphasis on the “my”.&lt;/ref&gt;  . It doesn't matter if you are a male or a female here.   

'''Examples'''
* Someone (to Boy): {{Hebrew|אֵיך קוֹרְאִים '''לְךָ'''?}}
* Someone (to Girl): {{Hebrew|אֵיך קוֹרְאִים '''לָךְ'''?}}
* Someone: {{Hebrew|קוֹרְאִים '''לִי'''...}}

==How are You?==

Just like asking for names, {{Hebrew|מָה שְׁלוֹמְךָ?}} and {{Hebrew|מָה שְׁלוֹמֶךְ?}} (lit. “what [is] your-peace?”) alter whether asking a male or a female. As before, the former is used when asking males, and the latter females.

{{Hebrew|מָה נִשְׁמַע?}} (lit. “what [was] heard?”) means the same, but it is slightly less formal. It does not declend in gender.

'''Examples'''
* Someone (to Boy): {{Hebrew|מָה שְׁלוֹ'''מְךָ'''?}}
* Someone (to Girl): {{Hebrew|מָה שְׁלוֹ'''מֶךְ'''?}}
* Someone (to Someone): {{Hebrew|מָה נִשְׁמַע?}}

==Grammar: Genders==
 
Hebrew has two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. Each noun has an inherit gender, and that affects the adjectives that describe it and the verbs it does.

Unfortunately, Hebrew's choice of genders may defy common sense, as ancient languages sometimes do, and the gender of a noun usually can't be learned by just looking at the word. However, a good rule of thumb is that words ending in {{Hebrew|ה}} or {{Hebrew|ת}} are mostly feminine, and words ending in other letters are mostly masculine.   

The genders are marked by ''m'' and ''f'' for nouns.

==Vocabulary==
Transliterate and translate the following Hebrew expressions to English.

{|width=100% style=&quot;background:#FFFFFF;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| colspan=3|
|-
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
{{Question-answer
| question = להתראות
| answer = ''lehitra’ot''&lt;br&gt; See you later
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = תודה
| answer = ''todah''&lt;br&gt; Thank you
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = ?מה שלומך
| answer = ''mah shlomkha/shlomekh''&lt;br&gt; How are you?
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = שלום
| answer = ''shalom''&lt;br&gt; Hello, goodbye, peace
}}
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
{{Question-answer
| question = טוב
| answer = ''tov''&lt;br&gt; Good, well
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = ?מה נשמע
| answer = ''ma nishma‘''&lt;br&gt; What's up?
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = בסדר
| answer = ''baseder'' &lt;br&gt; OK, fine
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = ?איך קוראים לך
| answer = ''ekh qor’im lekha/lakh''&lt;br&gt; What's your name?
}}
|}

Translate the dialogue from the beginning of this lesson.
{{Question-answer
| question = ?דָּוִד: שָׁלוֹם! קוֹרְאִים לִי דָּוִד. אֵיך קוֹרְאִים לָךְ
| answer = ''David: Shalom! qor'im li David. Ekh qor'im lakh?''&lt;br&gt;
David: Hello! My name is David. What's your name?
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = ?שָׂרָה: שָׁלוֹם, דָּוִד. לִי קוֹרְאִים שָׂרָה. מָה שְׁלוֹמְךָ
| answer = ''Sarah: Shalom, David. Li qor'im Sarah. Mah shlomkha?'' &lt;br&gt;
Sarah: Hello, David. ''My'' name is Sarah. How are you?
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = ?דָּוִד: טוֹב, תּוֹדָה. מָה נִשְׁמַע
| answer = ''David: Tov, todah. Mah nishma?'' &lt;br&gt;
David: Good, thank you. How are you?
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = .שָׂרָה: בְּסֵדֶר. שָׁלוֹם, דָּוִד
| answer = ''Sarah: Baseder. Shalom, David. '' &lt;br&gt;
Sarah: Fine. Goodbye, David.
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = !דָּוִד: לְהִתְרָאוֹת
| answer = ''David: Lehitra'ot!'' &lt;br&gt;
David: See you later!
}}

Black Bean Soup with Tomato-Tomatillo Salsa

==Ingredients==

Soup:
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] dried [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black beans]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Onion|large onions]], [[Cookbook:Dice|finely diced]]
* 4 to 6 [[Cookbook:Garlic|cloves garlic]], minced
* 6 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Water|cold water]]
* 1 cup peeled, seeded and chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] (fresh or canned)
* Small sprig fresh or dried epazote (optional)
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped canned chipotle chile (or ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]], more to taste)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Cumin|ground cumin seed]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Coriander|ground coriander]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

Salsa:
* 1 large tomato, finely diced
* 3 medium tomatillos, husks removed and finely diced
* 1 small red onion, very finely diced
* 1 serranos or [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalopeño]] chile, very finely diced
* ¼ cup roughly chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro leaves]]
* Salt, to taste
* Crème fraîche or [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]], for [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]]

==Directions==

Soup:
# Pick over the beans. Soak, if desired and drain.
# In a deep, heavy-based pot, heat oil over medium heat.
# Add onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
# Add beans, garlic and water.
# Bring to a [[Cookbook:Boil|boil]], skimming any foam that rises to the surface.
# Reduce to a [[Cookbook:simmer|simmer]] and when the beans are soft, after about 1 hour, add tomato, epazote, chipotle chile, cumin, coriander and salt.
# Cook until the beans start to break down and broth begins to thicken.
# Taste for seasoning; add salt and pepper if needed.

Salsa:
# In a small bowl, combine tomato, tomatillo, onion, jalapeño and cilantro.
# Taste for seasoning and add salt as needed.

Together:
# Ladle soup into individual serving bowls.
# Garnish each with a spoonful of Crème fraîche and salsa.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* If you're serving this soup immediately, you can thicken it by [[Cookbook:Puree|pureeing]] a cup or two of the beans in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] or [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]] and then recombining them with the rest of the soup. If refrigerated overnight, the soup will thicken on its own.
* The salsa will taste best if assembled no more than an hour before serving.
* Epazote is an herb that looks like a weed and is regularly used in Mexican cooking. If you can't find it, use an equal amount of cilantro.
* Tomatillos look like rock hard tomatoes with papery skin. Look for them canned in the Hispanic section of your market, if you can't find fresh. They will be perfectly acceptable.
* Crème fraîche is similar to sour cream, but richer. Look for it in the fancy cheese section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added to the page entitled &quot;Different Types of of Guitars&quot;, because someone mislabeled something and now we have wound up with two different ones. This is the original, but someone changed the link and added an &quot;of&quot; on accident I believe, but I changed it back to this one. I think the other one can be deleted now. [[User:Chesemonkyloma|Meemo]] 00:42, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

shouldn't you add the oriental guitar?

does anybody know if it's better to string a hollow body guitar with electric or acoustic strings?????

== You think someone ought to add more pictures? ==

Just a suggestion.

I don't think I have the knowlege to do it myself, so anyone that does...?

how come ukulele is not included

== Suggestion to use only three of the current six images ==

Three of the images use a white background. The other three vary in background. It might be an idea to just use the three images with the white background for formatting reasons. It will give a unified look to the page if the images have the same background.

I'll remove the three and see how it looks. Might need all six.

Quick Oat Bread

==Ingredients==

* 1⅓ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|white whole wheat flour]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 2¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1¼ teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Oats|quick-cooking (not instant) oats]]
* 1 cup minus 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] plain [[Cookbook:Yogurt|low-fat yogurt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], [[Cookbook:Beat|beaten]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|low-fat milk]]

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|375°F]].
# Butter a 9-by-5 loaf pan; set aside.
# In a large mixing bowl, combine white whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda; set aside.
# In a medium bowl, combine oats, yogurt, egg, oil and honey, then stir in milk until combined.
# Pour oat mixture over flour mixture and gently stir until just combined and flour is no longer visible.
# Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth the top.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] 40 to 50 minutes, until a wood pick tests clean.
# During the last few minutes of baking, tent with foil to prevent over-browning if needed.
# Let bread stand in the pan 15 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack to cool.
# Serve slightly warm.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* One manufacturer of white whole wheat flour is King Arthur brand.
* To avoid compacting the flour while measuring it, spoon the flour into the measuring cup instead of digging it down into the flour. Then run a flat knife over the top edge of the cup to scrape off the excess.

Bacon-Wrapped Scallops

==Ingredients==

* ½ [[Cookbook:Gallon|gallon]] (0.9 litres) [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] for [[Cookbook:Fry|frying]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Teriyaki|teriyaki]] glaze
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

==Directions==

# Heat oil in a deep fryer or other pot to 350 °F (180 °C), making sure that the pot is large enough that the oil doesn't fill it more than halfway.
# Combine teriyaki glaze, soy sauce and sugar in a medium bowl. Set aside.
# Cut bacon strips in half lengthwise.
# Wrap each scallop with one of these half strips of bacon, and secure by skewering with a wooden toothpick.

# Remove from oil, drain briefly and toss in the soy-teriyaki sauce.
# Serve immediately.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Do not eat the toothpick!

[[Image:Wheat-haHula-ISRAEL2.JPG|right|300px|thumb|''Mt. Ħermon, Israel's highest disputed point, from the Ħulah Valley.'']]

Welcome to the second basic lesson of Hebrew! In this lesson we're going to learn age-related basic phrases, the definite article and important vocabulary &amp;mdash; the numbers and the personal pronouns.

==Dialogue==
The next day David and Sarah meet again in the same café. This time they talk about each other's ages. Words that aren't dotted with vowels are vocabulary you are supposed to know, read and translate once you see it even without vowels. If you don't, go to the previous lesson and study the “vocabulary” section.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;
{{Hebrew|
'''דוד:''' שלום, שרה! בַּת כַּמָּה אַתְּ?&lt;br&gt;
'''שרה:''' היי, דוד! אֲנִי בַּת עֶשְׂרִים וְשָׁלוֹשׁ.&lt;br&gt;
'''דוד:''' בְּאֱמֶת? אֲנִי בֵּן תְּשַׁע־עֶשְׂרֵה.&lt;br&gt;
'''שרה:''' טוב, להתראות!&lt;br&gt;
'''דוד:''' ביי!&lt;br&gt;
}}
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

{{Question-answer
| question = Transliterate the dialogue (new vocabulary underlined).
| answer = '''David:''' Shalom, Sarah! &lt;u&gt;Bat kamah at?&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br&gt;
'''Sarah:''' Hay (hi) David! &lt;u&gt;Ani bat ‘esrim veshalosh.&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br&gt;
'''David:''' &lt;u&gt;Be’emet? Ani ben t(e)sha‘ ‘esreh.&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br&gt;
'''Sarah:''' Tov, lehitra’ot!&lt;br&gt;
'''David:''' Bay (bye)!
}}

==The Numbers==
The first thing we are going to learn is the numbers in Hebrew. Numbers in Hebrew is a complicated subject and therefore this is only an introduction.

When on their own, the numbers are in the feminine form. Examples of isolated numbers in English are “sample no. '''3'''”, “'''5:00''' p.m.”, “'''10''' Downing St”.

'''Notes'''
* In 25 there is an additional Vav {{Hebrew|ו}}. You will learn about that in the coming lessons.
* The numbers 20, 30, 40... as well as hundreds 100, 200, 300... do not declend in gender.

==Asking for Age==

{{Hebrew|בֵּן כַּמָּה אַתָּה?}} and {{Hebrew|בַּת כַּמָּה אַתְּ?}} both mean “how old are you?” (lit. “son/daughter-of how-much are-you?”). Again, this changes with the addressee's sex, being male or female.

You may answer by saying {{Hebrew|אֲנִי בֵּן/בַּת...}} (lit. “I-am son/daughter-of...”), but in this case, it also changes with the gender of the speaker: {{Hebrew|אֲנִי בֵּן}} (I'm son of...) is used by males, whereas {{Hebrew|אֲנִי בַּת}} (I'm daughter of...) is used by females.

'''Examples'''
* Someone (to Boy): {{Hebrew|'''בֵּן''' כַּמָּה '''אַתָּה'''?}}
* Someone (to Girl): {{Hebrew|'''בַּת''' כַּמָּה '''אַתְּ'''?}}
* Boy: {{Hebrew|אֲנִי '''בֵּן'''...}}
* Girl: {{Hebrew|אֲנִי '''בַּת'''...}}

This is followed by your age in the feminine form {{Hebrew|אֲנִי בֵּן אַרְבַּעִים}}. You can also replace the {{Hebrew|אֲנִי}}, {{Hebrew|אַתָּה}} or {{Hebrew|אַתְּ}} with names or other personal pronouns which you will learn next.

==Personal Pronouns==
Hebrew lacks the personal pronoun “it” and has no masculine/feminine counterparts for the 1st person.

{|  {{Hebrew table|Vocabulary|?בֵּן כַּמָּה אַתָּה|Personal Pronouns|כִּינוּיֵי-גוּף|3}}
!
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| 1
| {{Hebrew|אֲנִי}}
| {{Hebrew|אֲנַחְנוּ}}
|-
| 2 ''m''
| {{Hebrew|אַתָּה}}
| {{Hebrew|אַתֶּם}}
|-
| 2 ''f''
| {{Hebrew|אַתְּ}}
| {{Hebrew|אַתֶּן}}**
|-
| 3 ''m''
| {{Hebrew|הוּא}}*
| {{Hebrew|הֵם}}
|-
| 3 ''f''
| {{Hebrew|הִיא}}*
| {{Hebrew|הֵן}}**
|}

'''Notes'''
*The Aleph is silent (pronounced ''hu'' and ''hi'', respectively).
*The plural feminine pronouns ({{Hebrew|אַתֶּן}} and {{Hebrew|הֵן}}) are quickly falling out of use, particularly by young people, replaced by the masculine pronouns. When talking to/about a mixed group of people from both genders use {{Hebrew|אַתֶּם}} and {{Hebrew|הֵם}}.

==Grammar: Definite Article==
Hebrew lacks the indefinite articles “a” and “an”, so if a word doesn't have a definite article it simply means it's indefinite. The definite article, on the other hand, does exist in Hebrew, and it is a one-letter prefix, that can be added to the beginning of any noun or adjective and represents definiteness. 

The definite article is He with pataħ {{Hebrew|הַ}}.

'''Examples'''
*A number
:{{Hebrew|מִסְפָּר}}
*&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;The&lt;/font&gt; number
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;{{Hebrew|הַ}}&lt;/font&gt;{{Hebrew|מִסְפָּר}}

Under some circumstances, the vowel immediately following the He changes. However, Israelis ignore these rules and always pronounce the He with pataħ, and you are expected to do the same. 

When you see the definite He with a different vowel, such as {{Hebrew|הֶ}}, pronounce it always as if it were a {{Hebrew|הַ}}.

==Vocabulary==
Transliterate and translate the following Hebrew expressions to English.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Geometry Window==

*The main window in Wings 3D is the '''Geometry Window'''.  This is where your work is displayed and worked on.  You can change the size and position of any window in Wings in several ways.  Wings allows you to customize all your windows, you can even tell Wings what colours it should use for the title bar, background, etc.

[[Image:Graby2.png|frame|''The Square found at the bottom right hand corner of many windows in Wings, allows you to resize that window by the methods shown here in the Information Line.'']]

*To customize the size of the '''Geometry Window''' you can '''Grab''' (Left Mouse Button (LMB) hold and drag) the square with the diagonal through it found in the bottom right hand corner of the '''Geometry Window'''.  This allows you to change the window size, but to move the '''Geometry Window''' you have to '''Grab''' the window's title bar.

===Geometry Title Bar Resize Options===

*Along the very top is the title bar which is labeled with the window's name '''Geometry'''.  If you place the mouse cursor over the '''Geometry Window Title Bar''' then press and hold down the LMB you can drag the window to a new position and drop it by releasing the mouse button.

*Wings allows you to '''Fit''' the '''Geometry Window''' into a space horizontally or vertically by placing the mouse over its title bar and clicking the '''Right Mouse Button''' (RMB).  This brings up a menu with the following options:  '''Fit, Size, Hide/Show Toolbar'''.

[[Image:Geometry_Window_Resize_Options.png|frame|''Right clicking the Title Bar of most windows in Wings, opens the window resize menu.  Here we see the result of right clicking the Geometry Window's Title Bar.'']]


----
:*''Clicking '''Fit''' brings up a sub-menu asking whether to fit the window to '''Both''' (horizontal and vertical), '''Horizontal''' or '''Vertical'''.''

:*''Clicking '''Size''' allows you to specify the exact pixel width and height of the '''Geometry Window'''.''

:*''Clicking '''Hide Toolbar''' make the view area a little larger by hiding the Toolbar.  When the Toolbar is hidden this menu will say '''Show Toolbar'''.''
----
''Note that a '''Middle Mouse Button''' click on the title bar of the '''Geometry Window''' resizes the window both horizontally and vertically to fit a given space.  This works for all the windows in Wings.''
----


*All of the other windows in Wings 3D can be  resized and positioned in the same way as the Geometry Window.  If you want more than one view port you can resize the Geometry Window then select '''Window|New Geometry Window'''.  The new window will be called '''Geometry #2'''.  You can add as many windows as you like and position them how you want.  The other windows and their functions will be discussed later on.

To ask how much an item costs, say:
{{Hebrew-Vocab|?כַּמָּה זֶה עָלָה|How much does this cost?|question|''Kamah'' (KAH-mah) ''zeh oleh'' (OH-leh)?}}

A common shorthand is:
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=4&gt;?כּמה זה&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
''Kamah zeh''?  =  How much is this?

If you are pointing at a specific item, say a radio, you might say:
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=4&gt;?כּמה הרדיוֹ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
''Kamah haradio'' (ha-RAH-dee-yo)?  = How much is the radio?

{{Hebrew-Large| ?מִי הִיא}} -- Who is she?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sunspots''' are caused by magnetic disturbances that erupt through the visible surface of the Sun (photosphere). Deep inside the Sun many free moving subatomic particles produce very strong and complicated magnetic fields. When strong magnetic field lines erupt through the photosphere, they slightly impede the flow of energy from deeper layers outward to the surface, thus causing the area of the sunspot to be slightly cooler than the rest of the Sun, and hence darker.

Sunspots typically have a dark inner zone called an umbra, surrounded by a lighter outer zone called a penumbra. Many are as large as the Earth, and some have been known to be as large as Jupiter. Larger sunspots are usually groups of spots rather than just one. Often, adjacent sunspots have been shown to be of opposite magnetic polarity, with magnetic field lines flowing from one to the other, much like a bar magnet.

The solar activity cycle corresponds to the sunspot cycle, and is on the average about 11 years. That is, the numbers of sunspots, along with other less obvious activity on the Sun, waxes and wanes about every 11 years. In addition, the magnetic polarity scheme of sunspots reverses once every cycle, so we can also say that there is a 22-year cycle in solar activity.

This book is about assembly language programming for the Fujitsu BS2000 Mainframe and the IBM 360, 370, 93xx and z/System family of mainframe computers.  The same assembly language was also used on the Univac 90/60, 90/70, and 90/80 mainframes.  The term &quot;360&quot; will be used to refer to all of these.  This book will attempt to teach how to program in 360 assembly, the history of the processor family, and the basic architecture of 360 processor systems.

== Why Learn Assembly? ==

Assembly is the most primitive tool in the programmers toolbox. Entire software projects can be written without ever once looking at a single line of assembly code. So the question arises: why learn assembly? Assembly language is the closest form of communication that humans can engage in with a computer. Using assembly, the programmer can precisely track the flow of data and execution in a program. Also, another benefit to learning assembly, is that once a program has been compiled, it is difficult--if not impossible--to decompile the code. That means that if you want to examine a program that is already compiled, you will need to examine it in assembly language. Debuggers also will frequently only show the program code in assembly language. If nothing else, it can be beneficial to learn to read assembly language, if not write it. 

On mainframe computers it is usual that most programs are written in Cobol, Fortran or other high level languages.  There are a small number of reasons for learning a mainframe assembly language.
* Work on compilers for high-level languages
* Work on operating system exits 
* Maintenance of existing assembly language applications
* Work on security applications
* Updating screen maps for CICS or other applications which were written as Assembler macros.

== Who is This Book For? ==

This book will serve as an introduction to mainframe assembly language, but it will also serve as a good resource for people who already know the topic, but need some more information on 360 system architecture, and advanced uses of 360 assembly language. All readers are encouraged to read (and contribute to) this book, although a prior knowledge of programming fundamentals would be a definite benefit.

There are a number of different computers that used the 360 machine architecture.  These include 
*IBM 360 series, the Univac 90/60 and 90/70 series, the RCA Spectra 70 series and the English Electric System 4 series  
*The IBM 370 and Fujitsu B2000 are, and Univac 90/80 were an enhanced version of the 360 series.  
*Smaller versions of the IBM 370 were also released as the 43xx series.
*Larger versions of the 370 were released as the 30xx series.  
*The z/System is similar to the 370 series except that the z/System is a 64-bit machine while the IBM 370 and predecessors are 32-bit machines.

The 360 architecture is a ''big endian'' machine, in that values are stored high to low.  For example, the 16-bit value 256 would be stored (in hex) as '''0100''' on a 360-series machine, but be stored as '''0001''' on an Intel Pentium.  The number 1, on the other hand, if rendered as a 16-bit number, would be stored (in hex) as '''0001''' on a 360, and '''0100''' on a Pentium.  Also, the standard character set on the 360/370/Z-System is EBCDIC, while the Pentium uses ASCII.  This can cause a number of headaches in conversion of binary data files from one machine to another.

The 360 architecture is a 32-bit machine, in which the standard word size is 32 bits.

The 360 architecture has:- 
: 16 general purpose 32-bit registers (64-bit on the z/System) numbered 0 to 15 (usually Equated to the labels &quot;R0&quot; through &quot;R15&quot;) 
: 16 32-bit access registers numbered 0 to 15 if access mode is enabled (bits 16 and 17 of the PSW are set to X'01'); (Access registers are not available on the 360)
: 16 privileged 32-bit control registers, 0 to 15, used to control various operations of the computer (not available on the 360)
: 4 floating point 64-bit registers numbered 0, 2, 4 and 6, and 
: a 64-bit (128 bit on z/System) Program Status Word (PSW).  The Program Status Word is comprised of the privileged bit, the program counter, and the memory protection key, among other flag bits.

The privileged bit indicates the state of the program that is currently executing. There are two states, problem and supervisor.  A program is in supervisor state if the privileged bit is set.  
  
:'''Problem state''' is where all user software operates.  Problem state applications have restrictions including memory read and write restrictions, and cannot directly issue I/O instructions.  
:'''Supervisor state''' is reserved for the operating system and any of its components.

The memory protection key is 4 bits and determines which memory areas the particular program has access to.  Pages of the computer's memory are marked with certain protection keys, and only a program running with the same key (or key of zero) may write to a particular section of memory.

Certain registers on the 360 are &quot;reserved&quot; either by hardware requirements, or by convention (operating system usage or common practice). 

'''Register 0''' is generally used in a number of instructions as a placeholder to indicate a lack of action.  Many (non-'''RR''') instructions treat use of register 0 as having a value of zero or equivalent to address X'00000000' in memory. Depending on the operating system and whether address 0 is real address 0 or a virtual address, this area may protected against reading, writing, or both (unless the current task is operating in supervisor state or storage key 0.)  

'''Register 1''' is, by convention, used to point to the list of arguments (32 bit addresses) passed to a called subroutine, and for passing arguments for operating system calls ([[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/SVC|SVC]]'s). It is also used by the Translate and Test instruction [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/TRT|TRT]] specifically.

'''Register 2''' may be used by some instructions for additional parameters or return values, but is usually available for general use.

'''Register 13''' is, by convention, used to point to a save area for storing the passed registers by a called subroutine.  It is the logical equivalent of a &quot;stack pointer&quot; on processors that have a stack.

'''Register 14''' is, by convention, used to provide the address for a called subroutine to return to the caller.

'''Register 15''' is, by convention, used to provide the entry point address of a called subroutine and to provide the initial base register for the subroutine.  The subroutine may continue to use register 15 as its base register if it is short (and doesn't itself call a lower level subroutine) or, more typically, it will save this register (and others) immediately in the provided save area and use a different register (or set of registers) for the base.  Also, register 15 may be used by some operating systems to provide some arguments for SVC's.  Its use for this purpose bears some similarity to the Program Counter register on some mini and microcomputers. Register 15, by convention, is also frequently used as a return value from called subroutines, often set to an index value (0,4,8,12 etc.), suitable for direct use in a [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/branch table|branch table]] immediately after return.

When a program runs on the Linux operating system, supervisor calls are passed up to 6 values in registers 1 through 6, respectively. When a program runs on OS/VS1 or z/OS, supervisor calls are passed values in register 0, 1, or if more than 2, in a list pointed to by register 1.

The '''Program Status Word''' ('''PSW''') is a 64-bit (on the IBM 360 and 370, Univac and Fujitsu) or 128 bit (on the IBM z/System) privileged register which contains information about the current state of the machine.  Privileged programs can change the contents of the entire PSW through the [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/LPSW|LPSW]] privileged instruction.  Non-privileged programs may change some bits in the PSW through execution of various instructions including the [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/SVC|SVC]] instruction, or through certain arithmetic and comparison instructions, as well as via branch instructions. Sections of the PSW which have fixed values are shown in the table below in green.

An explanation of the fields in the PSW is as follows.
* (R) - Bit 1: Set to allow Program Event Recording (PER) interrupts if certain PER event-mask bits are set in Control Register 9.
* (T) - Bit 5: Set if Dynamic Address Translation (DAT) is enabled; this allows for virtualization of addresses; if clear, all addresses used in registers are real addresses.
* (IO) - Bit 6: Set if Input/Outpit (IO) interrupts can occur, controlled by bits in Control Register 6.
* (EX) - Bit 7: Set if external interrupts can occur.
* (Key) - Bits 8-11: Contains the storage key for the current running task.  This key is 0 for privileged tasks.  A task may only access areas of memory which are marked with the same key unless its key is 0.
* (M) - Bit 13: Set if a Machine Check interrupt is permitted to occur in the event of detection of damage. Subject to mask bits set in Control Register 14.
* (W) - Bit 14: Set if the machine is in wait state, clear if the machine is running.
* (P) - Bit 15: Set if the machine is in supervisor state, clear if the machine is in problem state.
* (AS)- Bits 16 and 17: Used in combination with the T-bit to control how address translation is to be performed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The method of joints is a way to find unknown forces in a truss structure.  The principle behind this method is that all forces acting on a joint must add to zero.  If there were a net force, the joint would move.

==Example 1==

===Question===
[[Image:StaticsTrussJointEx1.svg|thumb]]

Find the force in member BC of the truss pictured to the right.

===Answer===
Using the method of joints, the force could be found by isolating the joint at either end of the member (joint B or C).  Neither joint can be solved without further analysis; however, joint B can be solved if the force in member &lt;math&gt; AB &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; BH &lt;/math&gt; is found.

To find force &lt;math&gt; AB &lt;/math&gt; analyze joint A.  This joint has an external vertical force of 300N which must be countered by the members attached to the joint.  Member &lt;math&gt; AE &lt;/math&gt; cannot possibly support any vertical load, otherwise it would not be loaded axially and the entire structure would no longer be a truss.  If &lt;math&gt; AE &lt;/math&gt; has no load then member &lt;math&gt; AB &lt;/math&gt; is in 300N of tension.  

When joint H is analyzed it is found that the force in members &lt;math&gt; BH &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; HC &lt;/math&gt; must be zero.  The reason why neither member can carry any load is that member &lt;math&gt; BH &lt;/math&gt; can only take a vertical load and member &lt;math&gt; HC &lt;/math&gt; can only take a horizontal load.  In a real world application this structure might be useful if there was a load applied at joint &lt;math&gt; H &lt;/math&gt;. Now joint &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; can be analyzed.

[[Image:StaticsTrussJointex1ans.svg|thumb|left]]

The picture to the left shows the forces affecting joint B.

&lt;math&gt; \sum F_y = 0 = BH - BA + BC \cos(50) - BE \cos(50)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sum F_x = 0 = BC \sin(50) + BE \sin(50)&lt;/math&gt;

====Substitution====

From analysis of joint &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \ BA = 300N (Tension) &lt;/math&gt;

From analysis of joint &lt;math&gt; H &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \ BH = 0N &lt;/math&gt;

Put values for &lt;math&gt; BA &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; BH &lt;/math&gt; into the equilibrium equations for joint B.

&lt;math&gt; \sum F_y = 0 = 0 - 300N + BC \cos(50) - BE \cos(50)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sum F_x = 0 = BC \sin(50) + BE \sin(50)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \ -BC \sin(50) = BE \sin(50)
 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \ -BC = BE &lt;/math&gt;

Now &lt;math&gt; -BC &lt;/math&gt; can be inserted in place of &lt;math&gt; BE &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; sum F_y &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; BC &lt;/math&gt; can be solved for.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The method of sections is another method to determine forces in members of a truss structure.  In order to find unknown forces in using the method of sections, sections of the truss structure must be isolated.  The net force on the entire isolated section must be zero since the isolated section does not move (if it did move it wouldn't be a statics problem).  This method is often faster because instead of moving from joint to joint with the method of joints, the members of interest can be immediately isolated.

==Example 1==

===Question===
[[Image:StaticsMethodSectionQ.svg|thumb]]

The truss pictured to the right is secured with pin mounts to the brown concrete block.  A 100kg mass is hanging from the rightmost joint.  You can ignore the weight of the truss structure.  Calculate the tension or compression in member A-B.

===Answer===
This problem could be solved using the method of joints, but you would have to start at the joint above the weight then solve many other joints between the first joint and member A-B.  The fifth joint solved would give member A-B's loading.  It is easier using the method of sections.

The method of joints isolates a joint to find unknown forces.  The method of sections is the same except an entire section is isolated.  It should be obvious at this point that there cannot be any net force or moment on the section, if there was the section would move.

[[Image:StaticsMethodSection2.svg|thumb|left|]]

In order to find the stress in member A-B it is convenient to isolate the section of the truss as indicated by the image to the left.  In problems where the method of joints was used, a joint was isolated by cutting surrounding members.  Cutting is also used to isolate a section, three of the members of the truss were cut to isolate the section in this example.  Because all cut members were part of a truss, all members supported an axial force of tension or compression.  After being cut, all members must have the same axial force applied to support the section.

Equilibrium equations can now be written.

&lt;math&gt; \sum F_x = 0 = -T_1 - T_2\cos(60) - T_3 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sum F_y = 0 = T_2\sin(60) - 981N &lt;/math&gt;

The equation summing forces in the Y direction only has one unknown because all cut members except A-B are horizontal.

&lt;math&gt; \ 981 N = T_2\sin(60) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \ T_2 = 1130 N &lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt; T_2 &lt;/math&gt; is positive, member A-B is in 1130N of tension.

There are several types of instructions on the 360, 370 and z/System type mainframes. Instructions in the Available column which are marked '''All''' are available on all models.  Otherwise the instruction is only available on the System/370 and z/System machines.  Where &quot;base-displacement&quot; address is used, it means either an indexed base-displacement address, which consists of the value of a base register, an index register, and an unsigned 12-bit displacement address, or an unindexed base-displacement where only the base register and the 12-bit displacement address are used. A base-displacement address is presumed to be indexed unless specified as unindexed.  The instruction types are:

All instructions must be aligned to an even address.  Attempts to create an instruction at an odd address will be flagged as an error by the assembler; an attempt to branch to an odd address will result in a program check.

There are three classes of instructions.  360 instructions are those which were part of the original IBM 360 mainframe instruction set, they are shown on the table below in this color: [&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: center; background-color:#{{360 color}}; color:white;&quot;&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;].  370 instructions were added with the creation of the IBM 370, they are shown on the table below in this color: [&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: center; background-color:#{{370 color}}; color:white;&quot;&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;] are only available on 370 and higher series machines, and will cause a program check if they are attempted to be executed on a 360. z/System instructions were created after the 370,  they are shown on the table below in this color: [&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: center; background-color:#{{ZSystem color}}; color:white;&quot;&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;] and will not work on 360 or 370 hardware, only on z/System machines.

In general, there are seven types of instructions: 
*[[360 Assembly/Branch Instructions|Branch Instructions]], which jump from one part of a program to another
*[[360 Assembly/Data Transfer|Data Transfer Instructions]], which move data from one part of memory
*[[360 Assembly/Control Flow|Control Flow Instructions]], which make changes in the scope of execution of a program
*[[360 Assembly/Arithmetic|Arithmetic Instructions]], which do computations
*[[360 Assembly/Logic|Logic Instructions]], which make comparisons
*[[360 Assembly/Shift and Rotate|Shift and Rotate Instructions]], which move bits right or left,
*[[360 Assembly/Privileged Instructions|Privileged Instructions]], used by the operating system or other programs having special permission, primarily to do input/output or to control the operations of the machine, and
*[[360 Assembly/Other Instructions|Other Instructions]], instructions not otherwise classified

The table shown below can be sorted on any of its columns by clicking on the symbol at the top of that column.

There are two assemblers.  The older &quot;Basic Assembly Language&quot; and the &quot;High Level Assembler&quot;. There are certain constructs in the macro language as well as some of the newer assembly language instructions which are available only in the High Level Assembler.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Toolbar==

[[Image:Page13-3.jpg|frame|left|'''The Toolbar icons from left to right''': ''Shaded Preview, Orthographic View, Vertex, Edge, Face, Object, Show/Hide Grid, Show/Hide Axises.  Clicking the '''blank''' sections of the Toolbar will '''Deselect''' any selected elements.'']]









The Toolbar is a feature of the Geometry window.  It can be hidden by placing the mouse over the Geometry window title bar and clicking the ''Right Mouse Button'' then selecting '''Hide Toolbar'''.  To 'UnHide' the Toolbar repeat and select '''Show Toolbar'''.

===Functions===

*'''Shaded Preview'''- toggles '''Shaded Preview''' and the default view mode

*'''Orthographic View'''  - toggles between '''Orthographic View''' and '''Perspective View'''
::*''Orthographic View'' shows models in two dimensions.  In this mode, lines are not subject to foreshortening like they are in Perspective view.   Therefore, even the elements of geometry that are far away from the camera appear to be the same length as those up close.  This is useful for certain operations like moving elements only on the plane that the camera is facing with ''Move|Free'' or ''Tools|Tweak Mode''.  It is also useful in some ''Tools|Connect Mode'' operations.
::*''Perspective View'' shows the model in three dimensions and gives the impression the certain elements of the geometry are further away than others.  This is the ideal viewing mode for most modeling operations because this is how objects appear to us in the real world.  

*'''Vertex''' - switches to '''Vertex Mode'''
::*Clicking the ''Vertex Icon'' when in another selection mode will transform your current selection to its equivalent as ''Vertices''.
::*Clicking the ''Vertex Icon'' with a vertex selection already made will &quot;grow&quot; the selection.

*'''Edge''' - switches to '''Edge Mode'''
::*Clicking the ''Edge Icon'' when in another selection mode will transform your current selection to its equivalent as ''Edges''.
::*Clicking the ''Edge Icon'' with an edge selection already made will &quot;grow&quot; the selection.

*'''Face''' - switches to '''Face Mode'''
::*Clicking the ''Face Icon'' when in another selection mode will transform your current selection to its equivalent as ''Faces''.
::*Clicking the ''Face Icon'' with a face selection already made will &quot;grow&quot; the selection.

*'''Object''' - switches to '''Object/Body Mode'''
::*Clicking the ''Object/Body Icon'' when in another selection mode will select the entire object.

*'''Show/Hide Grid''' - toggles the '''Grid''' on and off

*'''Show/Hide Axises''' - toggles the '''Axises''' on or off

*'''Blank Sections''' - deselects any selected elements


----
''Note that Growing the selection using the Toolbar Icons does not Grow the selection in the same way that '''Select|More''' in the '''Menu Bar''' does.''
----
===Toolbar Icon Preferences===
:Since Wings 0.98.36, there are new options for changing the look of the '''Toolbar Icons'''.
:Go to '''Edit|Preferences|User Interface|Interface Icons'''
:Here you can change the set of icons you wish to use, however use will have to restart Wings to see your changes.
:Your choices are ''Classic'' as depicted above (the red pyramid icons),  ''Blue Cube'' and ''Purple Tube''.

This attempts to define terms related to the IBM 360 and similar mainframes.

* '''Base-displacement'''.  Addresses on the 360 series mainframe which are given in an instruction are given in base-displacement form, in which the address is referenced by a 4-bit number representing one of the 16 registers, numbered 0 to 15, which is used as a ''base,'' and a 12-bit index which is added to the contents of that register (unless that base register is register 0), as a ''displacement''.  The value of the displacement, plus the contents of the specific register, create the base-displacement address.
* '''Op code'''.  The first byte of an instruction determines what instruction it is.  This byte is called the op code.
* '''Program check'''.  An error in a program that causes hardware to stop its execution as an ''exception''.  A program will be terminated unless the program has issued a request to the operating system to trap the exception.   Program checks include any of the following:
** '''Data exception'''.  Program has attempted to perform packed arithmetic upon invalid packed data.
** '''Divide exception'''.  Program has attempted to divide by zero.
** '''Execute exception'''.  Program has attempted to use an EXECUTE instruction as the target of an EXECUTE instruction
** '''Operation exception'''.  Program has attempted to execute an invalid instruction.
** '''Privileged operation exception'''.  Program has attempted to execute a privileged or I/O instruction.
** '''Protection exception'''.  Program has attempted to read or write memory it is not allowed to access.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About me==

I'm an undergraduate engineering student who started editing wikipedia in November, 2006.  I came to wikibooks in January, 2007 to make it easier and cheaper for people to learn stuff.  I have added a couple of svg pictures made with inkscape to the [[statics]] book.  The examples that the pictures illustrate are basic and I'm adding more eventually they'll get more complicated.  Please let me know if you are confused or see something I should change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:45, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

== Naming policy ==

Please note your page &quot;Authors&quot; needs to be named as a sub page of the book you are working on - BOOKNAME/Authors to comply with policy.  The page can be &quot;moved&quot; so nothing is lost.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:45, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

Equally you will find I have moved Basic Writing: Process and Practice to [[Basic Writing/ Process and Practice]] to comply with policy - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:47, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

== [[Basic Writing]] book project ==

Hello Lanette, welcome to wikibooks! I've noticed your project; I think it's a great idea and it's progressing rapidly! If you wouldn't mind, Could you please list yourself at [[Wikibooks:List of class projects]]? We are trying to maintain this list of all the class projects that are occuring on Wikibooks, in hopes that these projects can be well-advertised, and that they can receive ample help from our editorial community here. 

Beyond that, I think that this book could serve a more immediate purpose to wikibooks, as many of the authors here have little or no experiance in authoring texts. Having a book that explains the proper ways to plan, write, edit, and revise would be a great benefit to the entire community. I applaud your effort, and if you need any help at all, please don't hesitate to ask. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:21, 13 February 2007 (UTC)


==[[Saylor.org's English Composition]]==

Hello, your Basic Writing book looks like a great project! If you're interested I was hoping you could also check out [[Saylor.org's English Composition]] textbook and make some contributions. Please take a look and let us know what you think. --[[User:Azin|Azin]] ([[User talk:Azin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Azin|contribs]]) 21:59, 30 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

== The page you moved ==

Other way round actually - that one was correctly named (no :), the rest are wrong.  Take a look at the naming policy stuff - thanks and welcome too --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

OK looking some more - maybe not, '''generally''' books are named without &quot;:&quot; but I do know there are some exceptions.  Ask around - [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff Lounge]] is good if the answer isn't anywhere else.  --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:51, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{miskito/Title| |Lesson structure| |Lexicon|Layout}}

In this page we shall see what the standard elements of a lesson are and what is in each standard element. For information on the technicalities of producing each of these elements using the course's templates and conventions, see [[Miskito/Layout|the Layout Guide]].

==How to start writing a lesson==

{{Miskito/Comment|Before starting a new lesson:}}
{{Miskito/Comment|First of all make sure you have read and understood this chapter, and look at some existing lessons to see in practice how they are organised and developed.}}
{{Miskito/Comment|Next, start deciding how many &quot;points&quot; there will be in the lesson and what will be in each component. At some point you also need to decide what the title of the lesson will be (try to make the title the same as one of the &quot;model&quot; sentences).}}
{{Miskito/Note|Some of the information you will need to take into consideration at this point is found in other pages such as the [[../Syllabus|Proposed Syllabus]] and the [[../Lexicon|Planned Lexicon]], so you will want to study these too.}}
{{Miskito/Note|You will also need to look at the [[../Contents|Table of Contents]] and existing lessons in order to see how to make sure everything &quot;fits together&quot; right.}}

{{Miskito/Comment|The technical instructions needed to perform the layout of a lesson using the course's templates are to be found in the [[../Layout|Layout guide]].}}
{{Miskito/Comment|When you're sure you're ready to start actual writing, the next step is to create the page and its title, following the [[../How#Start a new page|instructions here]].}}
{{Miskito/Note|Remember to follow the instructions applicable to '''lessons'''.}}
&lt;br&gt;

==Overall structure of a lesson==

The generic structure of a normal lesson is as follows:
{{Miskito/Generic table|Structure of a lesson:|
(title)
*(point 1)
*(point 2)
*(point 3)
*Vocabulary and review
}}
There may be any number of &quot;points&quot; (not necessarily three!). A lesson is divided into the sections (with second-level headings) shown here. Each of the &quot;points&quot; is named in the heading by a reference to the linguistic concept (e.g. Adjectives), corresponding English language item(s) (e.g. ''Is'', ''This'' and ''that'') or Miskito language item(s) (e.g. &quot;Lika&quot; and &quot;sika&quot;) covered, choosing whichever designation is most easily intelligible for most readers (and otherwise in this order of preference). For example, the sections of [[../Lesson 1|Lesson 1]] is as follows:
{{Miskito/Generic table|Sections of Lesson 1:|
Nini Mary sa
*''Is''
*''This'' and ''that''
*''The''
*''A''
*Vocabulary and review
}}

Each of the &quot;points&quot; consists of three &quot;components&quot;: ''Model, Commentary'' and ''Exercise''. The &quot;Vocabulary and review&quot; section has two components, of course: ''Vocabulary'' and ''Review''. This gives the following generic component structure:

{{Miskito/Generic table|Components in a lesson:|
(Title)
*'''(point 1)'''
**Model
**Commentary
**Exercise
*'''(point 2)'''
**Model
**Commentary
**Exercise

''etc.''

*'''Vocabulary and review'''
**Vocabulary
**Review
}}

==A note on layout==

The standard structure of a point, as we have already seen, consists of three components: a '''model''', a '''commentary''' and an '''exercise'''. These components appear on the page in the following layout:
&lt;table cellspacing=2 cellpadding=10 style=&quot;width:90%;&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan=2 style=&quot;background: #BECFEB;&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;''Standard point layout:''&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan=2 style=&quot;background: #DEE7F5; font-size: 115%;&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;model component&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background: #DEE7F5; font-size: 115%;&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;commentary component&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background: #DEE7F5; font-size: 115%;&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;exercise component&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
For details on the technicalities of editing these components (using the course's templates), please read the [[../Layout|Layout guide]].

==The model component==

===Purpose===

The purpose of the model component is to present a limited ''linguistic sample'' (such as a text, a conversation or a set of sentences, phrases or words) that illustrates, as clearly and succinctly as possible, the ''point'' to be studied.

===Format===

*The items that specifically exhibit the point under observation are in bold in the model sentences. For example, here (from [[../Lesson 1#This and that|Lesson 1]]):
{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| align=&quot;left&quot; |
* '''Naha''' John sa.
* '''Naha''' tuktiki sa.
* '''Baha''' Lucia sa.
* '''Baha''' yaptiki sa.
|}
:the point being studied comprises the demonstrative pronouns, which are ''naha'' &quot;this&quot; and ''baha'' &quot;that&quot;.
*The translations of the model sentences is also provided, but are initially &quot;hidden&quot;. The user may view them at will by clicking on &quot;Show&quot; and hide them again by clicking on &quot;Hide&quot;. This is what the whole thing looks like:

{{Miskito/Model|
* '''Naha''' John sa.
* '''Naha''' tuktiki sa.
* '''Baha''' Lucia sa.
* '''Baha''' yaptiki sa.
|
* '''This''' is John.
* '''This''' is my child.
* '''That''' is Lucia.
* '''That''' is my mother.
}}

&lt;br&gt;
NB Thanks to the course's template technology, all an author needs to write on the lesson page to get this is the following!
 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Miskito/Model|
 * '''Naha''' John sa.
 * '''Naha''' tuktiki sa.
 * '''Baha''' Lucia sa.
 * '''Baha''' yaptiki sa.
 |
 * '''This''' is John.
 * '''This''' is my child.
 * '''That''' is Lucia.
 * '''That''' is my mother.
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Look [[../Layout#The model component|here in the Layout Guide]] to see how such texts are laid out in the lessons.

==The exercise component==

===Purpose===

The purpose of the exercise component is to provide an opportunity to practise the point being studied. 

===Format===

*Different kinds of exercise are possible here. Translation (for comprehension) of a few additional examples, such as in the following example ([[../Lesson 1|Lesson 1]]), is just one of various possibilities:
{{Miskito/Mini exercise|
What do these sentences mean?
|
* Naha sirpi sa.
* Baha nini sa.
* Naha yaptiki sa.
|
* This is small.
* That is my name.
* This is my mother.
}}

*As the example illustrates, formally such an exercise consists of an ''instruction'' (here, &quot;What do these sentences mean?&quot;), a list of ''input items'' (in this case the Miskito sentences) and a corresponding list of ''output items'' (i.e. correct answers). The latter are initially &quot;hidden&quot;, but the user may view them or hide them at will by clicking on &quot;Show&quot; or &quot;Hide&quot;.

Look [[../Layout#The exercise component|here in the Layout Guide]] to see how such texts are laid out in the lessons.

==The commentary component==

===Purpose===

The purpose of the commentary component is to provide explanatory observations about the point being studied (or any other observations needed at this point in the lesson).

===Format===

Two different kinds of paragraph may be used in any number and order: ''comments'' and ''notes''. The main information should be placed in ''comments'' and any less central observations in ''notes''. ''Comments'' appear in large font, ''notes'' in normal-size font, bulleted, e.g. (in this example there are two ''comments'' followed by one ''note''):

{{Miskito/Comment|The general definite article (&quot;the&quot;) is '''ba'''. The article follows the noun.}}

==Vocabulary and review==

The '''Vocabulary and review''' section comes at the end of the lesson, after all the points, and covers the entire content of the lesson from two perspectives: a list of all the new vocabulary introduced, and an exercise that is useful for reviewing everything learnt in the lesson.

===The vocabulary component===

The vocabulary component lists all the new vocabulary items in alphabetical order in a three-column display. For each item the meaning is given, and for most a part of speech (POS) indication. (The abbreviations used for POS can be seen on the [[../Abbreviations|List of abbreviations]] page.) POS and meanings are all initially hidden, showing only the Miskito items, but can be shown or hidden individually as the user likes. Clicking on a word takes you to the lesson section where the word is first introduced. For example ([[../Lesson 1#Vocabulary and review|Lesson 1]]):

{|width=100% style=&quot;background:#DEE7F5;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| colspan=3|{{Miskito/Vocab_head|Click on &quot;Show&quot; for meanings. Click on word to see section.&lt;br&gt;[[../Abbreviations|List of abbreviations]]}}
|-
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
{{Miskito/Vocab|aisiki| |my father|1#A}}

{{Miskito/Vocab|baha|pron|that|1#This and that}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|buk|n|book|1#The}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|daiwan|n|animal|1#A}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|kum|det|a, an|1#A}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|mairin|n|woman|1#The}}
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
{{Miskito/Vocab|na|det|this|1#The}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|naha|pron|this|1#This and that}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|nini| |my name|1#Is}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|sa| |is|1#Is}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|sin| |too, also|1#The}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|sirpi|adj|small|1#Is}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|tara|adj|big|1#Is}}
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
{{Miskito/Vocab|tiara|adj|young|1#Is}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|tuktiki| |my child|1#Is}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|umpira|adj|poor|1#Is}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|waitna|n|man|1#The}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|witin|pron|she, he|1#Is}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|yaptiki| |my mother|1#This and that}}
{{Miskito/Vocab|yul|n|dog|1#A}}
|}

See the [[../Layout#The vocabulary component|Layout Guide]] for instructions on how to set up a vocabulary component.

===The review component===

The review component takes the form of an exercise (of any kind that has an ''input'' (or cue) and an ''output'' (or answer). Items appear as a vertical, numbered list. Answers (to the right of the corresponding cues) are initially hidden and may be shown or hidden individually. For example ([[../Lesson 1#Vocabulary and review|Lesson 1]]):

{|width=100% style=&quot;background:#DEE7F5;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|{{Miskito/Review_head|Say in Miskito}}
{{Miskito/Review|My name is John.|Nini John sa.}}
{{Miskito/Review|My father is big.|Aisiki tara sa.}}
{{Miskito/Review|He is young.|Witin tyara sa.}}
{{Miskito/Review|My mother is young too.|Yaptiki sin tyara sa.}}
{{Miskito/Review|That is my child.|Baha tuktiki sa.}}
{{Miskito/Review|This is a book.|Naha buk kum sa.}}
{{Miskito/Review|The woman is my mother.|Mairin ba yaptiki sa.}}
{{Miskito/Review|The man is my father.|Waitna ba aisiki sa.}}
{{Miskito/Review|My father is a man.|Aisiki waitna kum sa.}}
{{Miskito/Review|This animal is a dog.|Daiwan na yul kum sa.}}
|}

== 360 Assembler ==

I have corrected your section on 360 Assmebler. In particular, the claim that R0 is, by convention, used as a return value is incorrect and should, of course, be R15.</text>

== Freely licensed images cannot have imagery of non-freely licensed prgorams ==

Screenshots of software licensed under free licenses that include imagery of non-freely licensed programs like Microsoft Windows or others are '''not''' freely licensed. See [[commons:Commons:Licensing#Screenshots]]. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 20:21, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

== Uploaded Most of the changes with proper licensing ==

Hi Iamunknown,

Thank you for the message about the screen shots.  I have uploaded updated versions and amended the licenses but unfortunately I have one more that I hope you can tag for re-upload. This one:  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/a/a1/Wings_Tab_Entry.png 
I must have been working on the page when you dropped by:)  Thanks for the free legal advice and feel free to stop by again:)

Regards, Optigon.
01:48, 1 Feb 2007 (EST)


EDIT : I see that the option to upload is now available, so the graphic has been changed.  Does this option appear automatically after a certain period of time?
09:17, Feb 1 2007 (EST)

: The delayed upload is weird. It does not normally do that.
: Thank you very much for going through all those so quickly. I know that the image upload system is kind of confusing, but so you know in the future, you don't need to re-upload each image to re-tag them. You can go to the image description page (like [[:Image:Wings Tab Entry.png]]), click &quot;edit this page,&quot; and then add the tag. For example if you wanted to add [[Template:PD-self]] (acknowledging yourself as the author and releasing an image into the public domain), you would edit the page, and copy and paste &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD-self|PD-self]]}}.
: Another thing you might consider is tagging (as in editing the page and then copying-and-pasting) the free images of Wings 3D with &amp;#123;{[[Template:free screenshot|free screenshot]]|BSD}}. It isn't necessary, and again you don't need to re-upload each image, but it is standard practice. I could help you with that if you like.
: And thanks for your enthusiasm and all those contributions :) --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 17:55, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

----

Thanks for the advice.  This is my first attempt at Wiki so I appreciate the help.  Here's a question I've searched a little bit about.
How do I delete pages or at least mark them for deletion?  And how do I delete images or mark them for deletion?

For instance, on this wiki, there is an orphaned page that is only accessible through an image link.  the info on the page is incorrect and I've updated all the info while working on the wings manual page.  Could I just delete the image tag on that page making a red light turn on at wiki HQ, and they'll do the final deletion?

I know deletion requires sensitivity and that's probably why I haven't found a ''Here's how to Delete Images or Pages'' page.

Optigon

: Only users who get enough votes at [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]] (as per the administrator policy at [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]) have the ability to delete images and pages. Everything is reversible on MediaWiki (the software running Wikibooks), so they can also undelete both as well. You can, however, tag pages for deletion that are described at [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]. If the page is an unnecessary orphan, then you would tag it with &amp;#123;{[[Template:delete|delete]]}}. That would include the page in [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]], which administrators clear out regularly. (By &quot;tag it,&quot; I mean type bracket-bracket-''delete''-bracket-bracket at the top of the page, where the brackets are { and }. That includes the template [[Template:Delete]] on the page, which includes the page into the category.) If the page is not a candidate for speedy deletion as per the policy page, then you should list it at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. Just follow the instructions at the top of that page.
: Also, an unrelated piece of advice: when you want to sign your name at the end of a message, you may type four tildes (&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;), and when you save the page, the MediaWiki software will replace those four tildes with your username (with a link to your user page, [[User:Optigon]]) and a time stamp showing the time (in [[w:Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) at which you posted your message.
: If you have more questions, feel free to ask. :) --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 20:19, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{miskito/Title| |Layout guide| |Lesson structure|Templates}}

This page describes how to use the course's templates and conventions to produce each of the elements in a standard lesson of the course. For a general description of the structure of lessons, see the page on [[../Lesson structure|Lesson Structure]].

Templates are used to generate the components. To learn more about how this is done, you may need to read [[../Templates|Using the templates]].

== Point layout ==

The standard structure of a point (i.e. &quot;teaching point&quot; or &quot;learning point&quot;, depending on the point of view) consists of three components: a '''model''', a '''commentary''' and an '''exercise'''. These components appear on the page in the following layout:
&lt;table cellspacing=2 cellpadding=10 style=&quot;width:90%;&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan=2 style=&quot;background: #BECFEB;&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''''Standard point layout:'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan=2 style=&quot;background: #DEE7F5; font-size: 115%;&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;model component&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background: #DEE7F5; font-size: 115%;&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;commentary component&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background: #DEE7F5; font-size: 115%;&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;exercise component&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
NB The three components are edited in the following sequence: '''''model - exercise - commentary'''''. This is because the exercise is contained in a template (called Mini_exercise) which floats it to the right automatically. (If the text of the commentary component is long enough it will &quot;wrap around&quot; the exercise at the bottom forming an L-shape.)

The sequence of templates in a typical point is as follows (CAPITALS represent variable template parameters):

 &lt;nowiki&gt; ==SECTION TITLE==
 {{miskito/Model|
 LIST OF MODEL SENTENCES
 |
 TRANSLATIONS OF MODEL SENTENCES
 }}
 {{miskito/Mini_exercise|
 EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS
 |
 LIST OF EXERCISE INPUT ITEMS
 |
 OUTPUT ITEMS
 }}

 {{miskito/Comment|COMMENT}}
 {{miskito/Comment|COMMENT}}
 {{miskito/Note|ADDITIONAL NOTE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 {{miskito/Note|ADDITIONAL NOTE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This results in the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''SECTION TITLE'''&lt;/big&gt;
----
{{miskito/Model|
LIST OF MODEL SENTENCES
|
TRANSLATIONS OF MODEL SENTENCES
}}
{{miskito/Mini_exercise|
EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS
|
LIST OF EXERCISE INPUT ITEMS
|
OUTPUT ITEMS
}}

{{miskito/Comment|COMMENT}}
{{miskito/Comment|COMMENT}}
{{miskito/Note|ADDITIONAL NOTE}}
{{miskito/Note|ADDITIONAL NOTE}}


There can be any number of &quot;comments&quot; and &quot;notes&quot; in any relative order. The maximum length of each of these items is the paragraph. Other elements should generally be kept in the order shown.

== The model component ==

The purpose and composition of model components is explained [[../Lesson structure#The model component|here in the Lesson Structure page]].

The [[Template:Miskito/Model|Miskito/Model]] template is used to create model components in the following way:
 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Model|
 LIST OF MODEL SENTENCES
 |
 TRANSLATIONS OF MODEL SENTENCES
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
For example, the following (from [[../Lesson 1#this and that|Lesson 1]]):
 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Model|
 * '''Naha''' John sa.
 * '''Naha''' tuktiki sa.
 * '''Baha''' Lucia sa.
 * '''Baha''' yaptiki sa.
 |
 * '''This''' is John.
 * '''This''' is my child.
 * '''That''' is Lucia.
 * '''That''' is my mother.
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
produces this result:

{{miskito/Model|
* '''Naha''' John sa.
* '''Naha''' tuktiki sa.
* '''Baha''' Lucia sa.
* '''Baha''' yaptiki sa.
|
* '''This''' is John.
* '''This''' is my child.
* '''That''' is Lucia.
* '''That''' is my mother.
}}


Notice that the model sentences are laid out as a bulleted list, with key items (i.e. those being studied in this point) indicated in bold. The translation is presented in parallel fashion.

== The exercise component ==

The purpose and composition of exercise components is explained [[../Lesson structure#The exercise component|here in the Lesson Structure page]].

The [[Template:Miskito/Mini_exercise|Miskito/Mini exercise]] template is used to create exercise components in the following way:
 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Mini_exercise|
 EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS
 |
 LIST OF EXERCISE INPUT ITEMS
 |
 OUTPUT ITEMS
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
For example, the following (from [[../Lesson 1#this and that|Lesson 1]]):
 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Mini_exercise|
 What do these sentences mean?
 |
 * Naha sirpi sa.
 * Baha nini sa.
 * Naha yaptiki sa.
 |
 * This is small.
 * That is my name.
 * This is my mother.
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{miskito/Mini_exercise|
What do these sentences mean?
|
* Naha sirpi sa.
* Baha nini sa.
* Naha yaptiki sa.
|
* This is small.
* That is my name.
* This is my mother.
}}
results in:

Notice that this template automatically &quot;floats&quot; the whole exercise to the right hand side of the page. In edition, the exercise is placed immediately ''before'' the text that is to appear to its left (such as these lines), where the commentary will normally go.

The input items may be laid out as a bulleted or a numbered list. It is probably best to use bullets for short exercises (with few &quot;questions&quot;) and numbers for longer oned (to facilitate comparison with the answers). The output items (or answers) are presented in the same format as the input.

== The commentary component ==

The purpose and composition of commentary components is explained [[../Lesson structure#The commentary component|here in the Lesson Structure page]].

The [[Template:Miskito/Comment|Miskito/Comment]] template is used to insert comments as follows:
 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Comment|COMMENT}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The [[Template:Miskito/Note|Miskito/Note]] template is used to insert notes as follows:
 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Note|NOTE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
For example:
 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Comment|The indefinite definite article (&quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;) is '''kum'''. This
 article follows the noun too.}}
 {{miskito/Note|'''Kum''' is also the number &quot;one&quot;.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
results in:

{{miskito/Comment|The indefinite definite article (&quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;) is '''kum'''. This article follows the noun too.}}
{{miskito/Note|'''Kum''' is also the number &quot;one&quot;.}}


== The vocabulary component ==

Vocabulary components are described [[../Lesson structure#The vocabulary component|here in the Lesson Structure page]].

The first step in laying out a vocabulary component from scratch is to create a table as follows:
 &lt;nowiki&gt; {|width=100% style=&quot;background:#DEE7F5;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
 | colspan=3|{{Miskito/Vocab_head|(OPTIONAL INSTRUCTIONS)}}
 |-
 | width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
 . . . . . . . . . .
 | width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
 . . . . . . . . . .
 | width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
 . . . . . . . . . .
 |}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
This produces a block of background colour onto which to superimpose the template elements (this is the function of the first and last lines). Secondly, it incorporates the [[Template:Miskito/Vocab_head|Miskito/Vocab_head template]], which consists of the darker horizontal bar of colour in the top right corner with the &quot;Vocabulary&quot; heading and room in the top right corner for instructions to be added if wished (the second line). The remaining lines divide the lower part of the table into three (still empty) cells of equal width from left to right. The lines of dots show where these cells are located.

{|width=100% style=&quot;background:#DEE7F5;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| colspan=3|{{Miskito/Vocab_head|(OPTIONAL INSTRUCTIONS)}}
|-
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
&lt;center&gt;. . . . . . . . . .&lt;/center&gt;
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
&lt;center&gt;. . . . . . . . . .&lt;/center&gt;
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
&lt;center&gt;. . . . . . . . . .&lt;/center&gt;
|}

The vocabulary, ordered alphabetically, will be split into three columns, and these columns will go in the places indicated by the rows of dots shown. For example, here is the vocabulary in ([[../Lesson 1#Vocabulary and review|Lesson 1]]):

{|width=100% style=&quot;background:#DEE7F5;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| colspan=3|{{Miskito/Vocab_head|Click on &quot;Show&quot; for meanings. Click on word to see section.&lt;br /&gt;[[../Abbreviations|List of abbreviations]]}}
|-
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
{{miskito/Vocab|aisiki| |my father|1#A}}
{{miskito/Vocab|ba|det|the|1#The}}
{{miskito/Vocab|baha|pron|that|1#This and that}}
{{miskito/Vocab|buk|n|book|1#The}}
{{miskito/Vocab|daiwan|n|animal|1#A}}
{{miskito/Vocab|kum|det|a, an|1#A}}
{{miskito/Vocab|mairin|n|woman|1#The}}
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
{{miskito/Vocab|na|det|this|1#The}}
{{miskito/Vocab|naha|pron|this|1#This and that}}
{{miskito/Vocab|nini| |my name|1#Is}}
{{miskito/Vocab|sa| |is|1#Is}}
{{miskito/Vocab|sin| |too, also|1#The}}
{{miskito/Vocab|sirpi|adj|small|1#Is}}
{{miskito/Vocab|tara|adj|big|1#Is}}
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
{{miskito/Vocab|tiara|adj|young|1#Is}}
{{miskito/Vocab|tuktiki| |my child|1#Is}}
{{miskito/Vocab|umpira|adj|poor|1#Is}}
{{miskito/Vocab|waitna|n|man|1#The}}
{{miskito/Vocab|witin|pron|she, he|1#Is}}
{{miskito/Vocab|yaptiki| |my mother|1#This and that}}
{{miskito/Vocab|yul|n|dog|1#A}}
|}

Each individual vocabulary item is entered by means of a [[Template:Miskito/Vocab|Miskito/Vocab template]], which looks like these (code on the left, result on the right):

{| width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| width=&quot;50%&quot;|
 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Vocab|ba|det|the|1#The}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{miskito/Vocab|ba|det|the|1#The}}
|-
| width=&quot;50%&quot;|
 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Vocab|aisiki| |my father|#A}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{miskito/Vocab|aisiki| |my father|1#A}}
|}

in other words:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Vocab|MISKITO|POS|ENGLISH|LINK}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

POS stands for &quot;part of speech&quot;. We may choose not to give a POS by placing a blank space in the position for this field, as in the &quot;aisiki&quot; example. LINK stands for data to link the word to the lesson and section where it first appears; the format is:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; LESSON#SECTION&lt;/nowiki&gt;

where LESSON is a number and SECTION is the name of the section, as in the above examples.

== The review component ==

Review components are desribed [[../Lesson structure#The review component|here in the Lesson Structure page]].

Again, we begin by setting up a table as follows:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {|width=100% style=&quot;background:#DEE7F5;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 |{{Miskito/Review_head|INSTRUCTION}}
 . . . . . . . . . .
 |}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

which produces:

{|width=100% style=&quot;background:#DEE7F5;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|{{Miskito/Review_head|INSTRUCTION}}
&lt;center&gt;. . . . . . . . . .&lt;/center&gt;
|}

where the dots indicate the body of the table. An instruction is placed here in the position marked by &quot;INSTRUCTION&quot;. The body of the table is then filled with instances of the [[Template:Miskito/Review|Review Template]], one for each question, like this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {{miskito/Review|INPUT SENTENCE OR CUE|OUPUT SENTENCE OR ANSWER}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

with the result:
{{miskito/Review|INPUT SENTENCE OR CUE|OUPUT SENTENCE OR ANSWER}}

A whole review exercise could then look like this: 

{|width=100% style=&quot;background:#DEE7F5;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|{{Miskito/Review_head|Say in Miskito}}
{{miskito/Review|My name is John.|Nini John sa.}}
{{miskito/Review|My father is big.|Aisiki tara sa.}}
{{miskito/Review|He is young.|Witin tyara sa.}}
{{miskito/Review|My mother is young too.|Yaptiki sin tyara sa.}}
{{miskito/Review|That is my child.|Baha tuktiki sa.}}
|}

for which the full code is as follows:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; {|width=100% style=&quot;background:#DEE7F5;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
 cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 |{{Miskito/Review_head|Say in Miskito}}
 {{miskito/Review|My name is John.|Nini John sa.}}
 {{miskito/Review|My father is big.|Aisiki tara sa.}}
 {{miskito/Review|He is young.|Witin tyara sa.}}
 {{miskito/Review|My mother is young too.|Yaptiki sin tyara sa.}}
 {{miskito/Review|That is my child.|Baha tuktiki sa.}}
 |}&lt;/nowiki&gt;</text>

== Subtle licensing issues ==

Hello Lirtferk. I noticed the images you uploaded to Wikibooks. Thank you very much for your contributions! I would like to iterate a few points regarding licensing issues. Just remember that every image needs to be tagged with its license and source

* You need to [[:Image:Trianglexemplar.png]]. If you created the image, you may consider using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD-self|PD-self]]}}, &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL-self|GFDL-self]]}}, or a CC license. If you retrieved the image elsewhere, you should provide the source and license.
* Free software is a bit trickier. Consider reading [[commons:Commons:Licensing#Screenshots]]. It provides an excellent explanation.
*# First, on [[:Image:Blender-Noob-to-Pro Proportional Menu.png]], you should use &amp;#123;{[[template:free screenshot|free screenshot]]|GPL}}, as Blender is licensed under the [[w:GNU General Public License|GPL]].
*# Second, you should mention your contributions (since the image is not a simple screenshot) and license them. You could probably do &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD-self|PD-self]]}} since they are simple outlines. But if the screenshot contains original work by you, then you might consider licensing it under another license.

I hope this helps and my post is understandable. If not, or if you have any another questions, please feel free to ask here or at my [[User talk:Iamunknown|talk page]]. Cheers! [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:21, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

== ItIsUnclear ==

Hello Iamunknown: it is unclear how to edit the copyright for the images. I tried uploading a new (the same) image with PD-self attached but it told me that there was already an image there, hmmm... Could you elucidate?

== Itisallfixednow ==

Dear Iamunknown: I've worked it out and fixed the licensing issues. All the best Lirtferk</text>

'''''Crocus''''' is a genus of perennial flowering plants, native to a large area from coastal and subalpine areas of central and southern Europe (including the islands of the Aegean), North Africa and the Middle East, across Central Asia to western China. The genus Crocus is placed botanically in the iris family (Iridaceae). There are about eighty species, of which approximately 30 are cultivated. 

The name of the genus is derived from the Latin adjective crocatus, meaning saffron yellow. The spice saffron is obtained from the stigmas of ''[[../Crocus sativus/]]'', a fall-blooming species.

Misuses of the name crocus

&quot;Autumn crocus&quot; is often used as a common name for Colchicum, which is in the lily family (Liliaceae), and which has six stamens; it is also known as meadow saffron. The so-called prairie crocus (formerly Anemone patens, now Pulsatilla patens or P. ludoviciana) belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae).

True autumn crocuses

Most true autumn crocus flower in September to November in the northern hemisphere. Some flower before their leaves appear. Autumn/fall flowering species include: Crocus banaticus (syn. C. iridiflorus), C.cancellatus, C. goulimyi, C. hadriaticus, C. kotschyanus (syn. C. zonatus), C. laevigatus, C. medius, C. niveus, C. nudiflorus, C. ochroleucus, C. pulchellus, C. sativus (saffron crocus), C. serotinus, C. speciosus, C. tournefortii. Crocus laevigatus has a long flowering-period which starts in late autumn or early winter and may continue into February.

As one of the first flowers to bloom in spring, the large hybridized and selected &quot;Dutch crocus&quot; are popular with gardeners. However, in areas where snow and frost occasionally occur in the early spring it is not uncommon for early-flowering crocuses to suddenly wither and die from a unseasonable frost or snowfall.
Most crocus species and hybrids should be planted in a sunny position, in gritty, well-drained soil, although a few prefer shadier sites in moist soil. Some are suitable for naturalising in grass. The corms should be planted about 3–4 cm deep; in heavy soils a quantity of sharp grit should be dug in to improve drainage.
Some crocuses, especially C. tommasinianus and its selected forms and hybrids (such as 'Whitewell Purple' and 'Ruby Giant') seed prolifically and are ideal for naturalising. They can, however, become weeds in rock gardens, where they will often appear in the middle of choice, mat-forming alpine plants and can be difficult to remove.

The first crocus seen in the Netherlands, where Crocus species are not native, were corms brought back from the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador to the Sublime Porte, A. Ghislain de Busbeq, in the 1560s. A few corms were forwarded to Carolus Clusius at the botanical garden in Leiden. By 1620, the approximate date of Ambrosius Bosschaert's painting (illustration, left), new garden varieties had been developed, such as the cream-colored crocus feathered with bronze at the base of the bouquet, similar to varieties still in the market. Bosschaert, working from a preparatory drawing to paint his composed piece, which spans the whole of Spring, exaggerated the crocus so that it passes for a tulip, but its narrow, grasslike leaves give it away.
Species

==Description==
The plants grow from corms and are mainly hardy perennials, and are found a wide range of habitats, including woodland, scrub and meadows.

Their cup-shaped, solitary, salverform flowers taper off into a narrow tube. Their color varies enormously, although lilac, mauve, yellow and white are predominant. The grass-like, ensiform leaf shows generally a white central stripe along the leaf axis. The leaf margin is entire. All crocuses typically have three stamens.

The taxonomic characteristics are based mainly on the presence or absence of a prophyll (a basal spathe) and the aspect of the style and the corm tunic.

'''Pruning''' is the removal of plant material in order to improve the shape and/or health of a plant.

Herbaceous plant pruning:

Woody plant pruning:
*Terms:
**Leader: A main branch, generally vertical and with side branches (laterals).
**Lateral: A horizonally held branch coming off a leader.
**Sucker: New stems or trunks emerging from therootstock of a tree or shrub.
**Water sprout: Vertical branches arising from a lateral.
**Crotch: Where two branches are connected at the base
**Included bark: Bark that is squeezed between two branches within a narrow crotch.
**Branch collar: A (generally raised) area on a large branch where the xylem and phloem go around a smaller branch.
**Cambium: The growing tissue between the bark and the wood.
**Dormant bud: Buds on branches or trunks that are not active and generally are not obviously visible on the bark.
**Bleeding: Loss of sap due to unhealed cuts and/or diseased tissues.
**Stub: Part of a branch that remains after the main part is removed by pruning or other causes.
*Types:
**Coppicing: Cutting a tree or shrub to the ground or nearly so.
**Thinning: Reducing the density of branches to allow air or light to penetrate the canopy.
**Fine pruning: A pruning technique where cuts are &quot;hidden&quot; as much as possible in order to leave the tree or shrub looking as if it naturally grew to the resulting form.
**Shearing: Cutting all the branches of a shrub or hedge back to a set line.
**Topping: Cutting the branches of large trees back to a set line
**Pollarding: 
**Limbing
**Candling
*Order of business:
**Deadwood
**Damaged and diseased branches
**Rubbing branches
**Crossing branches
**Branches in the way
**Reduction
**Aeration
**Symmetry and form

'''Grape hyacinths''' are a group of plants in the genus (''Muscari'') of plants native to Eurasia that produce spikes of mostly blue flowers resembling bunches of grapes. There are about forty species.

Some species are among the earliest to bloom in the spring, and are planted both in flower beds as well as in lawns and woodlands. They tend to multiply quickly when planted in good soils. The most commonly planted species is ''[[../Muscari armenaicum/]]''.

==Description==


==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Species==
*''[[../Muscari armeniacum/]]''
*''[[../Muscari aucheri/]]''
*''[[../Muscari azureum/]]''
*''[[../Muscari botryoides/]]''
*''[[../Muscari latifolium/]]''
*''[[../Muscari muscarimi/]]'' (''M. moschatum'')
*''[[../Muscari racemosum/]]'' (''M. neglectum'')

==Uses==
Many species are used for &quot;naturalizing&quot; in shady lawns or woodlands.

==Maintenance==
The smaller species tolerate mowing after bloom, with little effect on the next year's display.

==Propagation==
Offsets and seeds. Self propagates readily.

==Pests and diseases==

'''Narcissus''' is the Latin name for a group of hardy, mostly spring-flowering, bulbs. There are several ''Narcissus'' species that bloom in the autumn.  '''Daffodil''' is the common English name for all narcissus.  The botanic name of the genus is Narcissus. They are mostly native to the Mediterranean region, but a few species are found through Central Asia to China. The range of forms in cultivation has been heavily modified and extended, with new variations available in nurseries practically every year. 

The name Narcissus is derived from that of the narcissistic youth of Greek mythology, Narkissos. Though &quot;Narcissi&quot; is sometimes given in dictionaries as the grammatically correct plural of &quot;Narcissus&quot;, The American Daffodil Society prefers the use of &quot;narcissus&quot; for both singular and plural. (the Webster's Third New International Dictionary gives &quot;narcissus&quot;, &quot;narcissuses&quot; and lastly &quot;narcissi&quot; as plural forms)

The name Daffodil is derived from an earlier &quot;affodell&quot;, a variant of asphodel. The reason for the introduction of the initial &quot;d&quot; is not known, although a probable source is an etymological merging from the Dutch article &quot;de,&quot; as in &quot;de affodil&quot;.  From at least the sixteenth century  &quot;Daffadown Dilly&quot; or &quot;daffadowndilly&quot; has appeared as a playful synonym of the name.

Narcissus are sometimes called '''jonquils''' in North America, but strictly speaking that name belongs only to the rush-leaved ''[[../Narcissus jonquilla/]]'' and cultivars derived from it.

Paperwhites refer to the species ''[[../Narcissus papyraceus/]]''.

==Description==
The flowers have a central trumpet-shaped corona surrounded by a ring of petals. The traditional daffodil has a golden yellow color all over, but the corona may often feature a contrasting color. Breeders have developed some daffodils with a double or triple row of petals, making them resemble a small golden ball. Other cultivars have frilled petals, or an elongated or compressed central corona.

The foliage is simple, straplike with linear veination, fleshy, juicy, hollow, more or less glaucus. 

Daffodils are poisonous, and if eaten could result in death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/n/narcis01.html The poisonous qualities of daffodils]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growing conditions==
Moist, fertile, well-drained. To avoid disease problems do not irrigate in summer.

==Types==
The horticultural divisions include:
*Trumpet daffodils
*Large-cupped daffodils
*Small-cupped daffodils
*Double daffodils
*Triandrus daffodils
*Cyclamineus daffodils
*Jonquilla daffodils
*Tazetta (Poetaz or Bunch-flowered) daffodils
*Poeticus (Poet's) daffodils
*Bulbocodium daffodils
*Split-corona daffodils
*Other daffodils which don't fit the above divisions
*Species and wild hybrids
*Miniature daffodils are found in all divisions.

==Species==
*''[[../Narcissus papyraceus/]]''
*''[[../Narcissus tazetta/]]''

==Uses==
Cut flowers.

The daffodil serves as the national flower of Wales. One species, ''[[../Narcissus obvallaris/]]'', grows only in a small area around Tenby. In Wales it is traditional to wear a daffodil on Saint David's Day (March 1).

The flower is a common decoration flower during Chinese New Year. 

Various Cancer Societies around the world use the Daffodil as fundraising symbol.  &quot;Daffodil Days&quot; are organised to raise funds
by offering the flowers in return for a donation.

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvesting==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and diseases==
Generally free of problems in good soil, but prone to diseases in wet soils. Mammal pests generally avoid this plant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following are some ideas I'd like to use for making the author list for &quot;page-by-page&quot; printouts from [[A Wikimanual of Gardening]]. What I'd like to do is to make collections of pages to give or sell to people. 

Items in '''boldface''' really need a bot, most of the other stuff needs a thinking human being.

==Attribution for text==
*'''Count top 10 contributors, not including IPs'''
*Check original contribution... if stub, disregard and use edit count
*'''For transwikis, check top authors ''after'' import has taken place, as well as before.'''
*Use templates to query authors on whether they'd like to be attributed using their wiki names or real names
*'''Configure the bot to recognize those authors who have been contacted and provided real names, etc.'''
*Make a list of the top 5 (maybe the top 5 on both projects for transwiki)... double check to make sure none of these are vandals/spammers, keep going down top 10 list until 5 &quot;good&quot; contributors are listed
*Use a printonly div at the bottom of the page

==Attribution for photos==
*List photos used (top to bottom), using filename
*Attribute to wiki-name according to license, but make inquiries for proper attribution (again, get bot to log)
*Attribute PD and GFDL as well as CC.
*Include this in the printonly div below the text author list.

==Print style==
*Use the &quot;book over chapter&quot; heading 
**(see my monobook.js and monobook.cs for details)
*'''Hide link to main book and categories'''
*Use page break divs to prevent broken text, headers appearing at the bottom of a page, etc.
*Use a standard margin width to allow maximum use of paper space, while allowing for 3-hole paper for a ring binder.
*For thumbnail galleries, but the gallery in a no-print div, with a printonly div suggesting readers see the online version for more photos, etc.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
ERXLocalizer provides easy KVC (Key-Value Coding) access to localization. For a short description and a full list of all available methods please see the api (http://webobjects.mdimension.com/wonder/api/er/extensions/ERXLocalizer.html). 

==== How to use ====
The easiest way to use localization in you WebObjects applications is to use Project Wonder's built-in localization support using the the localizer() method in the [[Programming:WebObjects/WOnder/ERXSession| ERXSession]] class. The localizer() method allows you to bind your localized language strings directly to you components. Lets say you want to localize your WebObjects application in english and german. The only thing you have to do is to create the required language resources in you application's resource directory. If you use Eclipse to develop your WebObjects applications, this is the ./Resources directory in you application root directory.
For english and german localization you need to create the following files and directories:

 Resources
    |
    +-English.lproj
    |    |
    |    +-Localizable.strings
    |
    +-German.lproj
    |    |
    |    +-Localizable.strings

The Localizable.strings files contain the key-value pairs with you your localization. The key is always the ''placeholder'' for the translation and it is used in your WebObjects application to address the localized value. If your application is a simple ''hello world'' application, your localized files may look like

 {
   &quot;hello&quot; = &quot;Hello&quot;;
   &quot;world&quot; = &quot;World&quot;;
 }

for the Localizable.strings file in the English.lproj directory and

 {
   &quot;hello&quot; = &quot;Hallo&quot;;
   &quot;world&quot; = &quot;Welt&quot;;
 }

for the Localizable.strings file in the German.lproj directory.

To use the localized strings just bind the keys to an appropriate WOComponent (assuming you inherited your Session object from [[Programming:WebObjects/WOnder/ERXSession| ERXSession]] in your application).

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application says: &lt;webobject name=&quot;langHello&quot;/&gt; &lt;webobject name=&quot;langWorld&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

(HTML file)

 langHello : WOString {
   value = session.localizer.hello;
 }

 langWorld : WOString {
   value = session.localizer.world;
 }

(WOD file)

ERXLocalizer ''magically'' detects your system locale and puts out the the following HTML code if you use an english locale:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application says: Hello World&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

[[Category:WebObjects]]

==== Useful application settings ====
These are the default settings for ERXLocalizer:

  er.extensions.ERXLocalizer.defaultLanguage=English
  er.extensions.ERXLocalizer.fileNamesToWatch=(&quot;Localizable.strings&quot;,&quot;ValidationTemplate.strings&quot;)
  er.extensions.ERXLocalizer.availableLanguages=(English,German)
  er.extensions.ERXLocalizer.frameworkSearchPath=(app,ERDirectToWeb,ERExtensions)

You can provide your own defaults in your application properties file or set the defaults somewhere in the initialization code of your application, e.g.

    public Application() {
        NSLog.out.appendln(&quot;Welcome to &quot; + this.name() + &quot; !&quot;);
        /* ** put your initialization code in here ** */
        ERXLocalizer.setDefaultLanguage(&quot;English&quot;);
    }

==== Unicode support ====
If you are creating UTF-8 applications, please be aware that UTF-8 support for your Localizable.strings files seems not to work. Instead of being desperate, simply convert your Localizable.strings files to UTF-16. The localized strings are shown in the correct way in your UTF-8 application. For further information see [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/DesktopApplications/index.html?http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/DesktopApplications/T9LocalizingDComponents/chapter_22_section_2.html Localizing Property Labels] in the Apple Developer Connection.

This page (and probably subpages) will contain general information on using the DVR (using the tuners, setting up and playing recordings, etc..) for those programmed with [[w:Tivo|Tivo]] software.

[[w:Comcast|Comcast]] began rolling out Tivo software, currently only in the [[w:Boston|Boston]] area, as an extra-cost option in December 2007.  There is a $2.95/month extra charge, on top of the normal DVR fee. The software change requires a technician visit to monitor the upgrade, as there are issues with proper signal levels that must be confirmed first. The Tivo software uses the faster [[w:DOCSIS|DOCSIS]] modem for communication instead of the [[w:Out-of-band|OOB]] tuner.

As always, do &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; simply copy text or images from a manual! That is a copyright violation!!

==Enable 30-second skip==
Go to TiVo Recordings list and play back a recording.

Enter the following key sequence on the remote control:
Rewind
Slow
Fast Forward
Play
3
0
Advance

(The Advance key (aka skip-to-tick key) is the key that looks like ( -&gt;| ) .)
(Doesn't work on Tivo HD)

The user will hear 3 chime sounds to indicate that the 30-second skip backdoor has been successfully enabled. The user can enter the same key sequence again to turn off the 30-sec skip backdoor.

With the 30-sec skip backdoor enabled, and while in &quot;Play&quot; mode in Live TV, a recording, or an ON DEMAND program, pressing the Advance key ( -&gt;| ) will jump ahead 30 seconds. While in &quot;Fast Forward&quot; or &quot;Rewind&quot; mode, pressing the Advance key will jump to the next tick mark on the trickplay bar.

If the set-top box is restarted, the 30-sec skip backdoor setting is not maintained. Following a restart, the user will need to enter the backdoor key sequence to re-enable the 30-sec backdoor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to NVH ==
Noise is characterized by frequency (20-20kHz), level (dB) and quality. Noise may be undesirable in some cases, i.e. road NVH yet may be desirable in other cases, i.e. powerful sounding engine. 

Vibration is defined as the motion sensed by the body, mainly in 0.5Hz - 50Hz range. It is characterized by frequency, level and direction.

Harshness is defined as rough, grating or discordant sensation.

Sound quality is defined according to Oxford English Dictionary, &quot;That distinctive Quality of a Sound other than it's Pitch or Loudness&quot;

In generally, ground vehicle NVH and sound quality design are attributed by the following categories:

1.) Powertrain NVH and SQ: Interior Idle NVH, Acceleration NVH, Deceleration NVH, Cruising NVH, Sound Quality Character, Diesel Combusition Noise, Engine Start-Up/Shut-Down

2.) Wind Noise: Motorway Speed Wind Noise (80-130kph), High Speed Wind Noise (&gt;130kph), Open Glazing Wind Noise

3.) Road NVH: Road Noise, Road Vibration, Impact Noise

4.) Operational Sound Quality: Closure Open/Shut Sound Quality, Customer Operated Feature Sound Quality, Audible Warning Sounds

5.) Squeaks and Rattles

The '''Dogwoods''' comprise a group of 30-50 species of deciduous woody plants (shrubs and trees) in the family Cornaceae, divided into one to nine genera or subgenera (depending on botanical interpretation). Four subgenera are enumerated here.

Most species have opposite leaves, but alternate in a few. The fruit of all species is a drupe with one or two seeds. Flowers have four parts.

Many species in subgenus ''Swida'' are stoloniferous shrubs, growing along waterways. Several of these are used for naturalizing landscape plantings, especially the species with bright red or bright yellow stems. Most of the species in subgenus ''Benthamidia'' are small trees used as ornamental plants. 

The name 'dogwood' is a corruption of 'dagwood', from the use of the slender stems of very hard wood for making 'dags' (daggers, skewers). The wood was also highly prized for making the shuttles of looms, for tool handles, and other small items that required a very hard and strong wood.

The fruit of several species in the subgenera ''Cornus'' and ''Benthamidia'' is edible, though without much flavour. The berries of those in subgenus ''Swida'' are mildly toxic to people, though readily eaten by birds.

Popular legend has it that wood from the dogwood was used to construct the cross on which Christ was crucified.  God had pity upon the tree, giving it white flowers similar to the cross.  The reddish center of each flower symbolizes the blood of Christ.  God transformed the once towering tree into one that is small with twisted, gnarled trunks so they could never be used for the purpose of building a cross again. The term '''dogwood winter''' may be used to describe a cold snap in spring.

=== Summary ===
The [[Basic Writing/Authors|authors]] for the first edition of this book for the most part were the Spring 2007 graduate students in Theory of Basic Writing at [http://english.missouristate.edu/gradprograms.htm Missouri State University]. Beginning this spring (2009), a new group of Missouri State graduate students will be revisiting and adding to this text, making it Basic Writing version 2.0. Others are welcome to contribute to the project or to suggest areas overlooked. Future classes in Theory of Basic Writing and current or future ENG 100 instructors will continue the project. This is still open to anyone interested in Basic Writing.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

Wouldn't it make sense to use one of Tolkien's own writings (e.g. Namárië) instead of some Neo-Quenya construction? Not that I have anything against the latter, per se, but using a genuine Tolkienian writing would be preferable to using someone else's construction, at least in my mind. Thanks.--[[User:Arminius|Arminius]] 20:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

== why is there a fake language from some book? ==

seriously, i thought this is about real languages.

This simple program can be used to analyze your web server performance

this script might be saved as testmysql.py and tested on a Karrigell server used alone or behind Apache


 &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;# import MySQL module&lt;/font&gt;
 import MySQLdb
 import time
 t1 = time.clock()
 
 &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;# connect&lt;/font&gt;
 db = MySQLdb.connect(host=&quot;localhost&quot;, user=&quot;root&quot;,   passwd=&quot;123456&quot;,db=&quot;test&quot;)
 
 &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;# create a cursor&lt;/font&gt;
 cursor = MySQLdb.cursors.DictCursor(db)
 
 &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;# execute SQL statement&lt;/font&gt;
 cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT field1,field2 FROM table where field2 like '%%' limit 0,5000&quot;)
 
 &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;# get the resultset as a tuple&lt;/font&gt;
 result = cursor.fetchallDict()
 print &quot;Content-Type: text/plain\n\n&quot;
 
 &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;# iterate through resultset&lt;/font&gt;
 for record in result:
 &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;#   print record[0] , &quot;--&gt;&quot;, record[1]&lt;/font&gt;
     print &quot;%s, %s&quot; % (record['field1'], record['field2'])
     &lt;nowiki&gt;print &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; 

Now you can get the time spent by the query

 t2 = time.clock()
 t3 = t2 - t1
 print t3

      <text xml:space="preserve">The SAT generally does not test any arcane or difficult geometry; however, it is important to know several rules.  


== Degrees and Angles ==

#  A circle contains 360 degrees. Every circle contains 360 degrees. Each degree is 1/360 of the total distance around the outside of the circle.  
#  A line is a 180-degree angle. A line is a flat angle. Half a circle, or a semicircle, is also a 180 degree angle.  
#  When two lines intersect, four angles are formed.  
#  If two lines are perpendicular, their slopes are negative reciprocals.  If line A has a slope of 3, and line B is perpendicular to A, it has a slope of -1/3.  
#  When two lines intersect, the angles opposite each other will have the same measures.  These are known as vertical angles.  The total of all four angles created is 360 degrees.

The white center is now very strong. Black has two main options to counter it.
:[[/6...Nc6/]] attacks the d4 pawn. This pawn cannot be pushed as the e pawn would be left en prise.
:[[/6...c5/]] is far riskier. After 7. d5, Black can be strangled. This game is going to be very tactical.

[[/6...Bf5/]] is also possible but seldom seen as it is more passive than previous moves.

=Fred Defence=
===1...f5===
1...f5 is the 'Fred Defense,' a very disadvantageous move for Black. In the starting position of chess, it is well known that the two most vulnerable pawns are f2 and f7 because only the King guards them. Less well understood is that moving the f2 and f7 pawns creates open diagonals to the King, and makes the King more difficult to defend.
(Chessmaster 10th edition opening theory table.)

2.exf5 is said to give a clear advantage to White, but not necessarily the game. 2.f4 transposes directly to the Swiss gambit normally reached by 1.f4 f5 2.e4, while 2.d4 transposes to the Staunton gambit normally reached by [[Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...f5/2. e4|1.d4 f5 2.e4]].

Some good lines may be 1. e4 f5 2. exf5 Nf6 3. d4 d5 4. Bd3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Ne4 6. O-O Bxf5.

Trying to keep the pawn with Nh4 seems good.

An interesting line is 1.e4 f5 2.exf5 Kf7!? 3.Qh5+ g6 4.fxg6+ Kg7 5.gxh7 Rxh7. White should now play 6.Qe5+, after which both 6... Nf6 7.Bd3 or 6... Kf7 7.Nf3 give a clear advantage. Even after 6.Qg5+? Kh8 7.Bd3 Bh6 8.Qg4 Rg7 9.Qh4, white's position is still better.

==Statistics==
No stats as 1...f5 occurs very rarely among serious chess players.

Famous No-Knead Bread

*This recipe has circled the Internet faster than an African get-rich-quick scam, since it appeared in the ''New York Times'' in November, 2006,  and has been translated into German and Togo.
*The original recipe came from Jim Lahey, owner of Sullivan Street Bakery in Manhattan. It lets time, instead of you, do the work. Simply stir together the ingredients, and let the mixture sit for 18 hours. After brief handling, it sits for 2 to 3 hours more, then bakes in a covered cast-iron pot in a 450 degree oven.
*It should result in a round, rustic loaf, with a chewy crust and an interior with irregularly shaped holes, not fine-textured, but similar to an Italian ciabatta. It's tasty and makes great crostini.

==Ingredients== 

* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] all-purpose or bread [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 5/8 cups warm tap [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==

# In a large bowl combine flour, yeast, and salt.
# Add water and stir until blended. ''The dough will be shaggy and sticky.''
# Cover bowl with plastic wrap.
# Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably 18 hours, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees F.
# When the surface is dotted with bubbles, lightly flour a work surface or silicone mat and place dough on it.
# Sprinkle it with a little more flour, and fold it over on itself once or twice.
# Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest 15 minutes.
# Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to the work surface and your fingers, gently and quickly shape the dough into a ball.
# Generously coat a lint-free linen towel with flour. ''Not a terrycloth towel.''
# Put the dough seam side down on the towel and dust with more flour.
# Cover with another lint-free linen towel and let rise for 2 to 3 hours. ''Dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.''
# At least half an hour before baking, place a 3 to 4 quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex, or ceramic) in the oven and preheat to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|450°F]].
# When the dough is ready, carefully remove the pot from the oven.
# Slide your hand under the towel and turn the dough over into the pot. seam side up. ''It may look like a mess, but that's okay.''
# Shake the pan once or twice if the dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes.
# Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes.
# Remove the lid and bake 15 to 30 minutes more, until the loaf is beautifully browned.
# Remove the loaf from the pot and cool on a rack.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* If you can't find a pot, look in a neighborhood hardware store.
* You can substitute up to 50% whole-wheat flour, but much more and the texture will suffer.
* Add herbs or other seasoning when initially mixing the dough.
* Use wheat bran or corn meal to coat the towels, if desired.
* If the pot has handles, remove them if they are not heat-resistant.
* Use sturdy oven mitts.
* Before removing the heated pot from the oven, place 2 or 3 cooling racks on the counter.
* Do not place the superheated pot on the counter or anything else you don't want to scorch.

==Merging of [[Bicycle Repair]]==
Am I correct in thinking that the [[Bicycle Repair]] book is being amalgamated into this one? &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:Users:Samwilson|Sam Wilson]] (Australia) 04:13, 29 January 2007 (UTC)


==Top banner for the Bicycles pages==
There is a top banner for the bicycles set of pages: it is called '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Bicycles}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', and when this entry is placed at the top of a page it;
* automatically places the page in the ''Bicycles'' category; (the category tag becomes unnecessary).
* Makes a top banner with a link to the ''Bicycles'' book page in it; that is, the highest level page in the series.   There is also an option called '''bd''' that colors the banner if needed.  
** Shouldn't the highest level page be technology? [[ErikSorensen]] 27 Dec 2009
*** I think what you mean is shouldn't the subject bicycles be part of the subject technology. If so, this is done in the category / subject hierarchy, not within the book itself. If you click the Bicycles Wikilink at the bottom of the bicycles, where it says &quot;Subjects&quot;, it will open the Category page. At the bottom of this page you'll see that Bicycles is part of Human Powered Vehicles, and if you click this it'll take you to the HPV category which is part of the Transportation category and so on. If you think Bicycles should be categorised as a Technology you'd add the category Technology to the category page for Bicycles. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:31, 29 December 2009 (UTC)

I have added it to the first subdivisions of this book page, but there are lots more that might be done.  If anybody would care to add these, then please go ahead.

== Project page, style guide ==

Does this book have a Project page and/or a style guide?  They are two things that I would find very useful, would have thought they would have been linked to from here.  --[[User:Keithonearth|Keithonearth]] ([[User talk:Keithonearth|talk]]) 08:01, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

I am in complete agreement. I've noticed a lot of bouncing about in styles, and this can be confusing for a reader or potential contributor. For instance, it can be as complex as the guides to expand upon in the Maintenance and Repair section, which simply say things like, &quot;article needed.&quot; However, subpages in areas like this have a more comprehensive outline of what needs expansion. It can also be as simple as the alternate spellings of tires/tyres that is used throughout the book. -- [[User:Cqbarton|Cqbarton]] ([[User talk:Cqbarton|talk]]) 00:32, 8 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The unsugared version of the list stuff are sort of incorrect.

[1..] is in fact sweet for enumFrom 1
[1,3..] is sweet for enumFromThen 1 3
[1..10] is sweet for enumFromTo 1 10
[1,3..9] is sweet for enumFromThenTo 1 3 9

Those constructs using iterate are flat out wrong.  The range sugar works for any instance of Enum, and those constructs fully don't explain why you can do things like

[LT ..] ==&gt; [LT, EQ, GT]

I just made this change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Linux supports multiple users on a machine, even at the same time. Each user must log in with his or her user name and password.
Every user belongs to one or more groups. Users and groups are important in determining [[../Permissions|permissions]]. All the users are listed in /etc/passwd and all the groups are listed in /etc/groups. To find out your user name and groups you belong to, run the id command

 $ id
 uid=501(myname) gid=501(mygroup) groups=501(mygroup),502(anothergroup)

The numbers are user and group ''id''s, which are numbers that are associated with the user and group in /etc/passwd and /etc/group, respectively. These numbers are what the system uses internally, so you don't have to look at them, but you can use them in place of user and group names in certain commands (like [[Guide to Unix/Commands/File System Utilities#chown|chown]]). The human-readable names are shown in parentheses.

You can change your group to any group in ''groups'' or to a group that has a group password by using the [[Guide to Unix/Commands/File System Utilities#newgrp|newgrp]] command. You can also change to a different user entirely without logging out and in again by using the [[Guide to Unix/Commands/File System Utilities#su|su]] command. Changing your user and/or group not only changes what files you can access, but the user and group of any files you create.

Both of these commands put you in a new shell, and you have to exit the shell or logout to stop using the new group or user. If you just need to be user root to run one command (which is rather common on a UNIX machine, for doing administrative tasks), the [[Guide to Unix/Commands/File System Utilities#sudo|sudo]] command is what you want.

Users and groups can be managed from an administrative GUI or from a [[Linux Guide/Using the shell|shell]] with the commands

 useradd
 usermod
 userdel
 groupadd
 groupmod
 groupdel

which add, modify, or delete a user or group. You will have to be user ''root'' to run these commands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some things to be aware of:

* Any user-input that's taken should be considered string when using it for making an XMLRPC request.  This means you will have to check the string for valid/invalid XML characters.  Duh!  You knew that already.

* If you are making a library for xmlrpc, it will be a pain to decide how to do the datetime.iso-whatever datatype.  As a design decision, I decided that I would have a valid-int as string.  So before i do my string checking, i check to see if the string is numeric, and if so, is it specifically an integer above a certain number.  This may (read: probably will) really mess things up so i'm going to find some other way to explicitly type this parameter.  Something akin to a namespace identifier.

* xmlrpc is easier than SOAP, but you can only make one request at a time.

* Since no one using xmlrpc (web-apis, blog-apis such as metaweblog/livejournal api/blogger) is really supporting/using the &lt;datetime:iso8601&gt; is it really necessary to implement?  I would say only do it if you use it.  Otherwise, I would suggest sending the fields as strings or -in the case of an integer-based unix timestamp- send it as an int.

== Overview ==

'''''Orchideous''''' causes a bouquet of flowers to burst out of the end of a wand.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This spell is used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]] as part of the Weighing of the Wands ceremony; he uses this spell to test [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wand.

== Analysis ==

A minor spell, this is used only to confirm, in a harmless manner, that Fleur's wand can in fact do magic to an acceptable standard.

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 18|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]}}

== Overview ==

The '''''Avis''''' spell causes a flock of birds to appear out of the end of the caster's wand.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This spell is used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]] as part of the process of testing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Krum]]'s wand in the Wand Weighing ceremony. Krum's wand is a very sturdy wand, made of hornbeam and dragon heartstring, thicker than most; the Avis spell causes it to give a report like a gun as it creates a flock of small, twittering birds that fly off through the open window.

In Harry's sixth year, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] performs this spell twice: once in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] class, where she is the only person to be able to do it, unsurprisingly; and once a week later when she is suffering jealousy from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s budding romance.

== Analysis ==

This is a sixth-year spell; creation of living creatures, unlike Transfiguration from non-living objects, is not taught to Hogwarts students until quite late in their education. As such, it is a decent test of the capabilities of a wand.

== [[Russian/Lesson 1]] ==

You have mixed roman and cyryllic scripts [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Russian/Lesson_1&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1227978 here]. As result links to Wiktionary won't work. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:04, 9 December 2008 (UTC)
:Good Lord, I hurriedly went through and checked all links to everything thinking that it was a huge &quot;I broke WikiBooks&quot; mistake, and then after checking the diff realized you were only talking about a single link. I'm no sure it was necessary to tell me like that! But thanks for the thought.

# Lucia windar ra sa. (Lucia is at the window.)
}}

{{miskito_comment|The very common word '''ra''' is equivalent to several English prepositions, including ''in, on'' and ''at''. But it is not placed before but ''after'' the word it goes with, e.g. '''rum ra''' ''in the room''.}}
{{miskito_note|Because of its position, such a word is not called a ''pre''position but a &quot;''post''position&quot;.}}
{{miskito_note|Sometimes people write '''ra''' attached to the preceding word, e.g. '''tibil ra''' or '''tibilra''' ''on the table''.}}

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Plural nouns==
{{miskito_model|
* Buk ba tibil ra sa.
* Buk '''nani''' ba tibil ra sa.
* Mairin na umpira sa.
* Mairin '''nani''' na umpira sa.
* Yul '''nani''' ba utla ra sa.
* Yul nani ba utla '''nani''' ra sa.
* Yul ba daiwan sa.
* Yul '''nani''' ba daiwan '''nani''' sa.
* Waitna na miriki sa.
* Waitna '''nani''' na miriki '''nani''' sa.
|
* The book is on the table.
* The '''books''' are on the table.
* This woman is poor.
* '''These women''' are poor.
* The '''dogs''' are in the house.
* The dogs are in the '''houses'''.
* The dog is an animal.
* '''Dogs''' are '''animals'''.
* This man is an American.
* '''These men''' are '''Americans'''.
}}
{{miskito_mini_exercise|Translate, then put '''nani''' after the word in italics and translate again.
|
# ''Tibil'' ba rum ra sa.
# Tibil nani ba ''rum'' ra sa.
# ''Tuktiki'' ba ''miriki'' sa.
|
# (The table is in the room.)&lt;br&gt;Tibil nani ba rum ra sa. (The tables are in the room.)
# (The tables are in the room.)&lt;br&gt;Tibil nani ba rum nani ra sa. (The tables are in the rooms.)
# (My child is an American.)&lt;br&gt;Tuktiki nani ba miriki nani sa. (My children are Americans.)
}}

{{miskito_comment|'''Nani''' placed after a noun makes it plural: '''buk''' ''book'', '''buk nani''' ''books''.}}
{{miskito_comment|Other words stay the same as in the singular, e.g. '''na''' can mean either &quot;this&quot; or &quot;these&quot; ('''mairin na''' ''this woman'', '''mairin nani na''' ''these women'') and '''sa''' means either &quot;is&quot; or &quot;are&quot; ('''Buk ba ... sa''' ''The book is...'' vs. '''Buk nani ba ... sa''' ''The books are...'').}}
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==''We, they, these'' and ''those''==
{{miskito_model|
* '''Yawan''' tiara sa!
* '''Yawan''' rum ra sa.
* Witin umpira sa.
* '''Witin nani''' umpira sa.
* Naha ba miriki sa.
* '''Naha nani''' ba miriki sa.
|
* '''We''' are young!
* '''We are in the room.'''
* She/he is poor.
* '''They''' are poor.
* This is an American.
* '''These''' are Americans.

# Baha nani ba tuktiki nani sa.
# Yawan miriki nani sa.
|
# She/He is in the house.
# They are in the room.
# Those are my children.
# We are Americans.
}}

{{miskito_comment|The only intrinsically plural pronoun in Miskito is '''yawan''' meaning ''we (inclusive)'', i.e. ''we'' in the sense of ''you and me'', ''we INCLUDING YOU''.}}
{{miskito_note|With '''yawan''' the verb form stays the same as for the third person, so '''Yawan ... sa''' ''We are...''.}}

{{miskito_comment|To say &quot;they&quot;, on the other hand, we must put '''nani''' after the third person pronoun '''witin'''.}}
{{miskito_comment|Other pronouns, such as '''naha''' and '''baha''', are also pluralised by postposing '''nani'''.}}
{{miskito_note|The use of the definite article '''ba''' does not always correspond to that of &quot;the&quot; in English. Thus in Miskito we can say '''naha ba''' (literally &quot;the this&quot;).}}
&lt;br&gt;

==''Isn't/aren't''==
{{miskito_model|
* Buk na tara '''apia sa'''.
* Nini Pedro '''apia sa'''.
* Naha John '''apia sa'''.
* Buk nani ba tibil ra '''apia sa'''.

* The books '''are not''' on the table.
* The table '''is not''' in a house.
* We '''are not''' Americans.

# ''Tibil'' ba rum ra sa.
|
# (The table is in the room.)&lt;br&gt;Tibil ba rum ra apia sa. (The table is not in the room.)
}}

{{miskito_comment|The negative of '''sa''' ''is, are'' is '''apia sa''' ''is not'' or ''isn't'', ''are not'' or ''aren't''.}}

Although warnings had been given out as much as two days ago, the storm claimed 13 lives in Germany and disrupted the whole of Germany's long-distance rail traffic. Much trouble was caused by a steel girder weighing several tons that came down in Berlin main station. Though the girder had not hurt anybody it revelead a constructional defect that caused the only recently inaugurated station to remain closed for hours after the incident.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The Information Line===

The '''Information Line''' runs along the bottom of the main Wings window.  This is probably the most important thing to keep your eye on, ''especially'' if you are new to Wings.  The Information Line's main purpose is to display every possible button option available for any ''operation'', ''tool'', or ''menu item''.  Many of the tools and menu options have more than one function, and some of the more advanced options are only displayed in the Information Line.  To display any menu item's possible options or described function, simply hover over the item with the mouse cursor. 

The Information Line uses the letters '''L''', '''M''' and '''R''' for the '''L'''eft, '''M'''iddle and '''R'''ight   mouse buttons.  When several options are available for a tool, menu item, or during an operation, those options are displayed in the Information Line preceded by L, M, or R.  Sometimes the user will be prompted to depress a '''Modifier Key''' in conjunction with the designated mouse button.  Modifier Keys are often Control &lt;Ctrl&gt;, &lt;Alt&gt;, or &lt;Shift&gt;, or sometimes a combination of two or more are used with the mouse buttons.  There are other instances when '''Numeric''' or other keys are used to present option.  In cases where '''Number Keys''' are used to change the result of a command, Do Not Use The Number Pad Keys.  For Number Key Modifiers in the Information Line, use the Number Keys across the top of your keyboard instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Neurons==

The basic functional unit of the nervous system are neurons, i.e., cells that are specialized for processing and communicating information. Neurons have a basic structure of:
* The '''cell body''' (or soma) is the bulbous end of a neuron, containing the cell nucleus and much of the cells metabolic machinery.
* The '''axon''' carries information away from the cell body and may range in size from several microns to as long as several meters in giraffes and whales. Axons may branch into terminal buttons (designated sites of communication) at its end.
* '''Dendrites''' receive neurotransmitter secreted by the axon of other neurons.
* '''Synapse''' is a specialized junction between cells of the nervous system which permits signalling between them.

==Neurophysiology==
Neurons are able to conduct and process signals that involve small changes in electrical voltage generated across the neuronal membrane. At rest, the inside of the neuron is negative relative to the cell surround - the '''resting membrane potential'''. Individual signals are integrated across different regions of the neuron and throughout sets of neuronal networks in order to determine each unit's response and output. A special type of such voltage changes features a rapid spike in voltage resulting from changes in ion conductances - the '''action potential'''. Such signals are predominantly transmitted along axonal lines where neurons interact with other cellular entities over greater distances. 

===Ohm's Law===
Basic familiarity with key concepts in electricity is essential in order to appreciate the neuronal mechanisms active during such integration. Ohm's law holds that the rate at which electric charges flow (i.e., '''Current''' or I) depends on the force and its direction exerted onto the charged particle (i.e., '''Potential''', V) and the ease with which the flow can occur (i.e., '''Conductance''', g). The latter can also be expressed as the reciprocal of the conductance, namely as the degree to which the conductor obstructs the flow of charges (i.e., '''Resistance''', R). The flow of electricity is defined as flowing from negative to positive.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ohm's Law: &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I = g * V&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Electrical Properties of Neurons===

&lt;b&gt;d.&lt;/b&gt;[[Image:Neur_1d.gif]]&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The electric properties of the neuronal membrane can be expressed as a circuit diagram. &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;. Golgi-stained neuron with long axonal process. &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;. Circuit diagram of neuronal membrane combining membrane resistance (Rm), membrane capacitance (Cm) and internal or axial resistance (Ri). &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;. Decay in signal size over distance with Space Constant. &lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;. Change along the axon in Voltage response to the injection of a single square current pulse due to membrane capacitance&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The voltage present across the cell's membrane can be measured between a reference electrode and a conducting glass capillary tube drawn out to a very fine point, and inserted into the cell. At rest the neuronal interior is negative relative to the outside at between -60 to -80mV, while most non-neuronal cells feature a potential of about -30 mV. The current is carried by ions moving across the membrane at ion conductances when specific channels allow them to pass. Ignoring its active properties, the axon can in electrical terms be viewed as an insulated cable. An electric potential is able to spread passively along any stretch of membrane. In the process its strength decays and the slope of on- and offsets becomes less steep with distance due to the passive cable properties of the membrane. The latter include resistance along its length and both a resistance and a capacitance component across it. Signals will spread fastest when longitudinal resistance is low (e.g., via increased axonal diameter) and they will spread furthest when resistance across the membrane is high (e.g., with layers of myelin for added electrical insulation).

===Resting Potential===
A neuron is at rest when it has not been activated for some time. At that state it exhibits a negatively charged inside relative to the surrounding environment.

====Ionic Basis====
The '''Resting Potential''' emerges from an&lt;b&gt; unequal distribution&lt;/b&gt; of ions across the cell's membrane. An excess of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and of various Anions&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; exists on the inside while Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; exist in higher concentrations on the outside. The membrane is dotted with proteins that permit the flow of ions (i.e., ion pores) or control their flow (i.e., ion channels) across it. In a cell at rest only potassium ions (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are able to flow freely between the two compartments. Initially we observe a net flow of positively charged potassium ions from the inside where they are more numerous to the outside where their concentration is much lower (i.e., '''concentration gradient'''). With a net flow of positively charged ions from the inside across the membrane, the inside becomes increasingly negative relative to the outside (i.e., '''charge gradient'''). The resting potential settles into an equilibrium when as many potassium ions are pushed out of the cell along their concentration gradient, as will enter the cell along the accompanying electrical gradient. This equilibrium potential for potassium can be calculated using the &lt;b&gt;Nernst potential&lt;/b&gt; for known inside and outside concentrations of any given ion
&lt;center&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;450&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Nernst Potential (E) = &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.303 * &lt;sup&gt;RT&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;zF&lt;/sub&gt; * log(&lt;sup&gt;[ion]out&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[ion]in&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where R = the gas constant (8.3143 joules/mole-degree); T = absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin (310 degrees); z = ionic valence; F = Faraday's constant (96,487 coulombs/mole). 

Depending on their respective inside and outside concentrations at the particular cell, different ions will produce different equilibrium potentials (reversal potentials). The ion concentrations are usually similar to those listed:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;450&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ion]&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ion]&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;400&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-75mV&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;440&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;+55mV&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&quot;&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;125&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;+155mV&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-65mV&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The Nernst potential for potassium thus can be simplified to the following formula. [[Image:NernstK.gif]]
and for sodium is: [[Image:NernstNa.gif]]

The cell's resting membrane potential combines all relevant ion currents with K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions figuring most prominently due to their high resting conductance. In addition a small number of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions leak into the cell. The resulting resting membrane potential is thus slightly lower compared to the E&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;+ at around -65mV. To maintain the concentration gradient across the membrane of resting neurons, ATP continually supplies energy to the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase (ion pump) as ions leak across the axomembrane.

===Action potential===
An '''Action potential''' represents a transient inward current of cations (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). It is generated when the graded membrane potential rises above threshold either spontaneously or because of depolarizing input. 

====Ionic Basis====
During the action potential, '''voltage-gated sodium channels''' are opened when the potential rises (i.e., depolarizes) from resting potential (-65mV) to the cells threshold (-55mV). These channels close again when the potential further rises to +10mV. As sodium ions spread to neighboring areas of axonal membrane, they open sodium channels there via depolarization and the signal runs the entire length of the cell (i.e., the ''all-or-none-principle''). 

A '''Refractory period''' follows the action potential during which time the neuron reestablishes its normal resting potential. At the beginning of this period it is impossible for another signal to be transmitted, this is called ''absolute refractory phase''. This is followed by the ''relative refractory phase'' where it is possible to send another signal but more exitation than normal is needed.

The Duration of an action potential is 1-2ms in Vertebrates and 1-100ms in Invertebrates. Frequency of firing ranges from &lt;1 to about 100/sec (100Hz). The Amplitude ranges between 70-80mV when recorded intracellularly and 5-200µV when recorded extracellularly.

====Tetrodotoxin====

===Synapse===
====Electrotonic Junctions====
Two electrically excitable cells, such as neurons or muscle cells, may be electrically coupled where an action potential in one cell moves directly into the other via arrays of gap junctions. Electrical synapses are fast but cannot be modulated. They are mostly used in neuronal circuits for escape behaviors where speed of conduction is essential. Electrical synapses (gap junctions, electrotonic junctions) allow current to flow between separate neurons when ions pass through gap junctions. Connexons (where 6 connexin proteins form a hemi-channel) are the actual pores that allow ions to flow past the two membranes. A connexon in the presynaptic membrane lines up precisely with its respective equivalent in the postsynaptic membrane, forming a continuous channel from one neuron to another. With a pore diameter of about 1.5m-9 many small molecules can pass through efficiently. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration, pH, or phosphorylation of connexins can profoundly alter the easy with which ions annd proteins may pass through the pore. As there is no synaptic delay in transmission of current from cell to another, the conduction of potential changes is considerably faster than through chemical synapses. Although electrical synapses are often bi-directional, some synapses pass current better in one direction than the other (i.e., rectifying synapse) Electrical synapses are commonly used in time-critical processes (escape behaviors), when rapid synchronization of many cells is needed (e.g., vertebrate cardiac muscle), between glial cells, or early in development.

====Chemical Junctions====
Cells are also able to communicate chemically across a gap  (i.e., '''synapse'''), which forms a directional connection from one neuron to another cell.
The neurotransmitter is emitted from the terminal endings of one cell's axon onto a dendrite or body of a second cell. The arrival of a signal leads to the release of a neurotransmitter from the presynaptic terminal, diffusion across the synaptic cleft, and binding to receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. '''Ionotropic or metabotropic receptors''' are binding proteins which alter ion conductances at the postsynaptic cell membrane (e.g., increase in Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance depolarizes and is excitatory, CL&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; hyperpolarizes and is thus inhibitory). When excitatory, the postsynaptic cell is depolarized with an excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) and an action potential is elicited if the threshold is reached; in inhibitory connections, the postsynaptic cell is hyperpolarized with an inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP) and it will thus be harder for other inputs to drive the cell towards an action potential. A single input is rarely sufficient to lead to an action potential in the post-synaptic cell. Multiple EPSPs may add and reach the threshold when a series of action potentials arrive at high rate. Chemical synapses are capable of integrating a complex scenario of inputs:

'''Neurotransmitter''' refers to a compound that is released at a synapse and diffuses across the synaptic cleft to act on a receptor located on the membrane of a postsynaptic cell, which may be another neurone, a muscle cell or a specialized gland cell. A wide range of chemicals are used as neurotransmitters in the nervous system. Stored in synaptic vesicles. they are released during the arrival of an action potential and produce changes in the excitability of the postsynaptic membrane. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx at the axon terminus is required for synaptic release.

'''Neuromodulator''' refers to a compound that is released within a localized region of CNS, the receptor for which is not necessarily sited on an anatomically apposed postsynaptic cell. Thus a neuromodulator may affect several postsynaptic cells with specificity conferred mainly by the distribution of receptors. Main action is on second messenger systems, e.g. cAMP or inositole triphosphate, presumably affecting protein phosphorylation

Sometimes the same neurochemical may have rapid transmitter type effects, followed by longer modulatory influences. This suggests that neurotransmitter and neuromodulator effects may be most effectively classified at the receptor level. Activation of receptors on a protein structure directly incorporating an ion channel (a ionophore) are defined as neurotransmission while activation of receptors coupled indirectly to ion channels (e.g. via second messenger systems) are defined as neuromodulation.

====Signal Strength====
For the signal to be passed from one neuron to the next it must have enough energy to break a point called the threshold.
Once the threshold is broken the signal is transmitted. The neuron fires at the same strength every time. The strength of a signal is decided by how many different neurons are being fired and at what frequency they are being fired.

====Glial cells====
The amount of' glial cells to every neuron in the nervous system is disputed. Glial cells function as support for the neurons; they produce the myelin sheath which surrounds some neurons and also form part of the ''blood-brain'' barrier. 
The blood-brain barrier is a structure that prevents certain substances in the bloodstream from reaching the brain. Many axons are sheathed with tubes of myelin, which is a fatty material. Myelin is produced by the ''glial'' cells. The myelin sheaths on axons have gaps, which are called the nodes of Ranvier. Myelinated sheaths help transmit information quickly and efficiently.

====Synaptic Integration====
Activity in any presynaptic neuron alone is rarely sufficient to elicit an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. Summation of synaptic inputs, however, can occur when a neuron receives multiple exitatory inputs in short order. Synaptic processing describes the ways in which the electrical events in different neurons may interact through interactions at their synapses. Synaptic inputs are mostly located on the dendritic tree of a neuron, while axonal action potentials represent the neuron's output. In order to drive a neuron the integrated influence of the electrical events generated by the synapses must be sufficient to spread through the dendrites to the soma and into the initial segment of the axon (i.e., the axon hillock, trigger zone). The latter is the site of action potential generation. Synaptic integration is thus key to understanding the contribution of individual neurons to information processing within neural networks.

In '''spatial summation''' the cell responds when activity from multiple inputs arrives at the same time. If the combined excitation brings the cell to threshold, an actionpotential is initiated. The arrival of a spike train in a presynaptic neuron may produce multiple EPSPs. If these inputs begin to build on each other, the postsynaptic cell may reach threshold and produce an action potential.

Passive membrane properties are important. Long time constants increase the chances for temporal summation. Large space constants determine the likelihood of spatial integration. The size of the postsynaptic cell counts, as a synaptic current delivered into a small neuron will produce a much greater effect than in a large postsynaptic cell.

Location of synapses is important. Control of the cell's activity usually driven by excitatory synapses on dendrites. Inhibitory synapses located on the cell body are able to shut down activity. Synapses at presynaptic release sites are modulatorym controlling the amount of neurotransmitters released.

Most of the &quot;Authors' Area&quot; is set up at the time of writing. From now on it will be possible to concentrate more on producing lessons. However, I have been putting in intensive time to get things started, and will soon have to slow down drastically. Ideally I will reach a stable, steady work rhythm soon, and then we shall have to see how fast development of the course moves along. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 15:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

==&quot;To do&quot; list==

Right now, nearly everything :-)

==Help needed!==

===Miskito language expertise===

If by any chance there is anybody out there who knows Miskito, we really need your input on this, please! Let me say clearly and for all to hear that I am not a Miskito language specialist. My knowledge about the language is derivative from existing (and available) circulated materials. Until and unless somebody with sufficient knowledge of the language can give us feedback, users of the course are hereby warned!! ''Caveat emptor.''

Any suggestions about what to do about this? --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 15:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

===Graphics===

I am also somewhat &quot;graphically impaired&quot;, so if there is anybody around who thinks they could lend a hand to improve the graphic content of this course, feel free to join in!

===Feedback please!===

So far nobody has given any feedback on this course. I realise this is a &quot;backwater&quot; given that Miskito is a language fewer people are interested in learning than, say, French or Japanese. That just means that if anyone does happen across this material your opinion of it will be all that much more valuable! So please chip in, at least by saying what you think! I am going to be optimistic and set up a [[../Discussion|special discussion page]] for that. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 06:46, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

==Developer's notes==

To keep this section short and simple, new developments that are obvious from a look at the contents page (such as the addition of new lessons) will NOT be noted here.

===Added parameters to vocab entries===

I've added a fourth parameter to the vocab template for a page-and-section link for each vocabulary item. This is handy when studying vocabulary as a single click takes the learner to the section where the word was introduced for the first time. But the real reason for the change is in order to pave the way for building the general vocabulary, since now I'll be able to copy all the lesson vocabulary items to the general vocabulary file, order them alphabetically, and each item will already include its lesson reference. As well as clicking, you can hover the mouse pointer over an item and see its lesson number! --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:08, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

Have now added a fifth parameter for further grammatical information. This provides a place to indicate ligature forms for nouns, verb classes etc. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:58, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

===After a long absence (sorry about that)...===

*Added navigation links at the bottom of lesson pages (as well as the ones at the top) to facilitate moving on to the next lesson at a single click, following a suggestion made by 122.164.151.90 on the [[Miskito/Discussion|discussion page]] (which I'm glad to see is starting slowly to come to life!).
*Finally fixed the template formatting that was making the [[Miskito/Discussion|Proposed syllabus]] page so unsightly. (Better late than never!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{miskito/Title| |Aims and objectives| |Development|Method}}

==Long-range goals==

This course is (perhaps) somewhat special, in terms of goals, in that, in my conception (ARK), these actually go beyond the straightforward aim of producing a Miskito language course. From its inception, I have started working on this course with a broader objective in mind: I want to create a ''model of language course design'' that will be applicable to a wide range of implementations in different languages.

Admittedly the field of language course production can be considered a very large one, in which a great deal of groundwork already exists &quot;out there&quot;. I do consider myself knowledgeable in many aspects of this field given my background; yet I certainly cannot claim to be the last and only authority on the matter of course. To justify the ambition I have just owned to, therefore, let me attempt to make it a bit more specific, and also more pertinent to the present context.

I think it would be a very good thing if many of the authors (or would-be authors) of Wikibooks language courses (among others?) had access to some sound methodological guidance to help them along the way. I am aware of some attempts already made in this direction, so I don't claim to be the first to think of that, but I think there is a need for more - much more.

That being my first point, my second is that I believe this to be quite possible. With time, I have hopes of being able to make a substantial contribution along such lines myself. Because that is both a large task and one that goes very far beyond the writing of a course in Miskito (or language X), this is not the place to expound my views or proposals in detail on the matter, so I will not try to. For now, suffice it to say that I consider it something on my &quot;To Do&quot; list.

Then why am I not doing it? One reason why is that my vision of a handbook for language course authoring is of a practical material that people find easy to use, and one requisite for that to be possible is that there must be ''real examples'' previously in existence of what such a handbook tells its users to do. So, I thought it would be a good idea to start by producing a couple of examples myself, before attempting to explain the hows, whys and wherefores on a more general level.

One way in which this larger context affects the present language course is that I am particularly interested in following a strict methodological line, not only because this will hopefully result in a better product, but also because I want to set an example that others can perhaps some day follow.

For this purpose I have chosen to develop a course in Miskito, a relatively important language (''all'' languages are important, so the operative word is ''relative'') of Central America spoken by some 183,400 people (according to the Wikipedia article [[w:en:Miskito language|Miskito language]]) along the Atlantic seaboard of Honduras and Nicaragua. Although I have lived in Central America and have worked on indigenous languages of the area, I have not had the opportunity to visit the Miskito area myself, and all the knowledge of the language I have is gleaned from materials on the language written by others, many of which are available to the on-line reader of Wikibooks since they either are, or once were, freely available on the Internet (see [[../Links|Links and bibliography]] for references). Previously I wrote the [[w:en:Miskito grammar|Miskito Grammar]] article on Wikipedia, synthesizing some of the information to be found in such materials. In the sense explained, I view this language course as something of an &quot;experiment&quot;, and I thought that Miskito was a good a choice as any for a first try at carrying this experiment out.

==Objectives for this course==

Leaving aside the broader aims alluded to above, the practical objective of the forty-ish lessons projected for the present course (of which, at the time of writing, the first two exist) is to provide a basic level of general knowledge of the Miskito language.

''For whom?'' Target users of this course will be people who can read the language it is in (i.e. are literate in English) and are capable of studying a language on their own from this sort of material, which may be described as a fairly traditional &quot;teach-yourself&quot;-style introductory book. It is a known fact that many people cannot learn a language in this way, while some can. For those who can, I hope the course will prove a useful guide.

''What sort of &quot;basic level of general knowledge&quot; are we talking about?'' This is not a communicative language course in the modern sense (just as none of the &quot;teach-yourself&quot;-style books were or are, and I might add, neither are some of the &quot;modern&quot; books that claim on their covers to be so). I would like to state from the start that this course belongs to a very widespread (and respectable) kind of language courses that have their uses but also their limitations, and actually learning to communicate ''just'' from a course such as this is, realistically, outside those limitations. What this course ''will'' provide is knowledge of the basic workings, the mechanics, of the language as a system. Such knowledge can be valuable indeed to people who need to acquire communicative competence in a language. It can also have a range of other applications for some people who are not actually aiming to learn to communicate in the language.

''What do we mean by &quot;Miskito language&quot;?'' First and foremost, in the case of a course of these characteristics, the language's grammatical structure: how the language works (as a system, one might add). Secondly in order of priority, some of the language's most basic vocabulary. Thirdly, potentially at least, the possibility of accessing texts in the language in order to continue exploring it at the end of the course.

But as in the case of all &quot;teach-yourself&quot; books, it is in the last resort up to the individual reader or user to determine what the aim is and how to make the best use of the material provided as a help towards achieving that aim.</text>

The '''Swamp Dogwood''' (''Cornus amomum'') is a shrub native to eastern North America, commonly found in wetlands and along streambanks. It is rarely planted in gardens, but is useful for stabilizing stream and river banks. 

Other common names include: Kinnikinnik, Silky Cornel, Blueberry Cornel, Red Osier, Redbrush, Red Willow, Rose Willow and Squaw Bush.

==Description==
A large, suckering shrub with dark reddish bark.

==Growing Conditions==
Wet soils, but not in standing water.

==Uses==
[[Image:Cornus amomum flowers 01.JPG|thumb|right|300 px|flowers]]Used to anchor stream banks and for bird and wildlife habitat. Generally a bit wild for garden situations unless regularly cut to the ground to maintain a neat form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{OctaveNav}}

A '''structure''' in Octave groups different data types called fields in a single object. Fields are accessed by their names.

== Declaring a structure ==

A structure is declared by assigning values to its fields. A period (.) separates the name of the field and the name of the structure:

 &gt;&gt; city.name = 'Liege';
 &gt;&gt; city.country = 'Belgium';
 &gt;&gt; city.longitude = 50.6333;
 &gt;&gt; city.latitude = 5.5666;

The fields of a structure and their value can by displayed by simply entering the name of the struct:

 &gt;&gt; city
 city =
 {
   name = Liege
   country = Belgium
   longitude =  50.633
   latitude =  5.5666
 }

== Manipulating structures ==

A structure can be copied as any objects:

 &gt;&gt; city_copy = city;

In most circumstance, the fields of a structure can be manipulated with the period operator. The value of a field can be overwritten by:

 &gt;&gt; city.name = 'Outremeuse';

In the same way, the value of a field can be retrieved by:

 &gt;&gt; city.name
 ans = Outremeuse

The function ''isstruct'' can be used to test if object is a structure or not. With the function ''fieldnames'' all field names are returned as a cell array:

 &gt;&gt; fieldnames(city)
 ans =
 {
   [1,1] = name
   [2,1] = country
   [3,1] = longitude
   [4,1] = latitude
 }

To test if a structure contains the a given field named, the function ''isfield'' can be used:

 &gt;&gt; isfield(city,'name')
 ans =  1

The value of a field can be extract with ''getfield'':

 &gt;&gt; getfield(city,'name')
 ans = Liege

In a similar way, the value of a field can be set with ''setfield'':

 &gt;&gt; setfield(city,'name','Outremeuse')

The functions ''isfield'', ''getfield'' and ''setfield'' are useful when the names of a structure are determined during execution of the program.

The essential linguistic resources needed for the production of a course of this kind can be stated very simply as two: (1) a grammatical analysis and (2) lexical information. Or even more simply: a grammar and a dictionary. Other resources, which are actually more primary, are also important inasmuch as they can serve to supplement or enrich the grammar and the dictionary or even as a source from which to derive grammatical and lexical information: (3) native speakers' intuitive knowledge (which covers some things not found in numbers 1 and 2) and (4) a textual corpus, which ultimately derives from native speakers' knowledge and therefore, in another way, serves similar purposes.

Most immediately, ''Miskitu Aisas!'' rests, for its grammatical analysis, on the Miskito [[w:en:Miskito grammar|grammar sketch]] in Wikipedia. This in turn draws on other sources, which also complete the resources for the present course; these include a dictionary. See [[../Links|Links and bibliography]] for the details.

==Structural syllabus==

''Miskitu Aisas!'' is built around a progressive, didactic presentation of the grammatical structure of the Miskito language. Therefore, its architectural foundation is a ''grammatical'' (or ''structural'') ''syllabus''.

The first thing we need in order to create a grammatical syllabus is a coherent survey and analysis of the grammar of the language. In our case the data for this come from the resources mentioned above, and the systematisation is given in the [[w:en:Miskito grammar|Miskito grammar]] article already referred to. The next step is to select ''which'' elements of the grammatical system constitute the target content that the course will specifically aim to teach. In other words, the objective is not to teach &quot;everything&quot; about the language (or its grammar) but only, or above all, those elements that are required by the course's objectives. In a general sort of way, the aformentioned Miskito grammar article can also be considered a statement of what is most important about Miskito grammar, although certain refinements will be required on adapting that information to the purpose of developing the course.

We now come to specification of the grammatical syllabus as such, in which the proposed structural content of the course is itemised (divided up into bite-sized pieces, we could say) and sequentialised (arranged into an ordered sequence on the basis of various consideratons, such as degree of difficulty, usefulness, and teaching/learning strategy). At this point we decide how many lessons the course will contain and, at least provisionally, attempt to assign the items of language structure, henceforth called &quot;points&quot;, to numbered lessons.

==Target lexicon==

It is necessary to teach some basic vocabulary through the course, first because without any words no amount of grammar will provide meaningful knowledge of the language, and secondly because without words we cannot even present the grammatical system in a didactically valid fashion, since the student will not be able to see the rules at work. Given that some words need to be taught, we may as well make a reasonable effort to ensure that the words included are useful ones and that words that are absolutely necessary are included.

The procedure followed in this case is both rough-and-ready and intuitive. Given that a dictionary of Miskito exists (without one this would be far more difficult!), we take it as our starting point, and reading through the entire word list, choose (as best we can) the words that look likely to be useful ones. In part this is done through pure intuition - intuition that is sharpened by experience at teaching languages.

===Topics and notions===

But we can also introduce (and have done so) some ''method'', in the form of a topic-and-notion classification. Topics (thematic areas, semantic fields...) are subject areas. Here are some examples:

Clicking on &quot;Show&quot; in the above table displays examples of notions that belong to each of the topics shown.

Typically, a given notion (such as &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;father&quot;, &quot;hand&quot;, &quot;moon&quot;, &quot;table&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;money&quot;, &quot;story&quot;, &quot;give&quot;, &quot;drink&quot;, &quot;go&quot;, &quot;small&quot;, &quot;far&quot;, &quot;today&quot;...) is expressed by a word in the language, but that is not a foregone conclusion, and conceptually ''notions'' must not be confused with ''words''. Some notions are expressed by grammatical forms, some by compounds or paraphrases, some not at all (not all languages have a special word for &quot;countryside&quot;, &quot;knuckle&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;today&quot;, &quot;word&quot;, &quot;mango&quot;, &quot;ketchup&quot;, &quot;library&quot;, &quot;government&quot;, &quot;bank account&quot;, &quot;exam&quot;, &quot;explain&quot;, &quot;interesting&quot;, &quot;against&quot;, &quot;accidentally&quot; or &quot;away&quot;), and some by several different words or expressions depending on finer distinctions (e.g. there may be different words for &quot;sister&quot;, &quot;tooth&quot;, &quot;shoe&quot;, &quot;town&quot;, &quot;person&quot;, &quot;cook&quot;, &quot;wear&quot;, &quot;go&quot;... depending on the type of sister, tooth or shoe, the size of the town, the sex of the person, the manner of cooking, the garment worn, the mode of transport, and so on). ''A list of notions is not a checklist of &quot;words to be learnt&quot;.'' It is just a reminder of some of the possible meanings that the language learner ''may'' need to learn how to express and understand.

A topic-and-notion classification of (part of) the vocabulary for a language course is one useful way of organising the lexicon for a number of reasons:

*It helps us to check whether the topics that should (according to the course's objectives) be covered by the vocabulary given is or not, and suggest additions to the list.
*Similarly, it helps us to check whether the appropriate range of notions within a given topic is covered adequately.
*It suggests and facilitates several good criteria for deciding what vocabulary to teach when, e.g. presenting topically related notions (e.g. &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;man&quot;, &quot;big&quot; and &quot;small&quot;, etc.) at the same time, or introducing more important topics before less important ones.
*It provides a more practical checklist to keep control of what vocabulary has or has not been incorporated into the course at a given time than, e.g., a simple alphabetical list.

==Choosing model sentences==

The model sentences are practically the central point of a point because they are probably the first thing the learner will look at on commencing study of the point, and will also probably be referred back to while studying the commentary and perhaps while doing the exercise too.

Some students are likely to be capable of just looking at the model sentences (presumably together with the translations!) and ''inferring'' (i.e. &quot;educatedly guessing&quot;) the rule(s) with which the point is concerned. For those who can do this, it is a very good way of learning; the comments that follow will then serve as confirmation, or a kind of &quot;testing&quot;, of the student's hypothesis. One good thing about this way of learning is that it ensures understanding of the principles being learnt; another is that it is more motivating for very mentally-agile learners. This is to be taken into consideration when creating the model component so as to use examples which make it possible to infer the rule(s) correctly and easily.

Other learners will also lean more heavily on the models than on the comments that sum up the rule(s) because they find it easier to &quot;pick up&quot; things intuitively from examples than to understand and assimilate abstract explanations. So once again, the model sentences need to be constructed in such a way as that they do, indeed, illustrate well the point we want the learner to learn.

And even for learners of yet another kind, those who are good at understanding abstractions and can deduce the language from the rules (these are probably in the minority, but are often well-trained, intellectually bright students), the proverb that &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot; is still applicable, and here the &quot;picture&quot; is of course the example, and the examples are in the model component.

Sometimes it is not enough to give an example that contains the application of the rule in order to make it clear how the rule works, but there also needs to be another example to compare this one with where the rule does not apply: it is by contrasting the two examples that the rule is actually illustrated. In such cases we will generally place the example without the rule first and the one with it second. This procedure can also be thought of as going ''from known to unknown'', an important principle of learning that must be taken into account. Here is an example from [[../Lesson 2#Plural nouns|Lesson 2]]:
{{miskito_model|
* Buk ba tibil ra sa.
* Buk '''nani''' ba tibil ra sa.
|
* The book is on the table.
* The '''books''' are on the table.
}}
Here the point consists in learning the rule that we can make a noun plural in Miskito by placing ''nani'' after it. This is not illustrated in the first sentence, which contains no new elements and should therefore immediately be recognised by the alert student. But it is placed here because it is precisely by comparing it with the next example, which ''does'' contain ''nani'', that the meaning and function can be seen clearly.

It is also acceptable, and often good practice, to illustrate a pattern using a question-answer pair, where only one of the sentences (most often the answer) contains the target pattern, e.g. (from [[../Lesson 5#Here and there|Lesson 5]]):
{{miskito_model|
* Aisikam anira iwisa?
* Aisiki '''nahara''' iwisa.
|
* Where does your father sit?.
* My father sits ''here''.
}}
where the target item is '''nahara''' ''here'' (the reader already knows '''anira?''' ''where?'').

We don't want to include too many sentences which all show exactly the same thing in the model, because the purpose of the model is to help the learner to grasp the concept clearly, whereas the task of practising the concept is performed by the exercise component just beneath the model. On the other hand, it is probably wise to provide, if possible, between ''two or three'' examples of each specific pattern. Giving more than one example allows the learner to first produce a hypothesis (perhaps from the first example) and then test it out (perhaps on the second one) and reconfirm it (on the third). And it gives a second chance to understand something when one example is insufficient.

The total number of model sentences should also not be too high, so that learners can concentrate all their attention, at this point in learning (the &quot;moment of discovery&quot;) on a limited amount of material. Therefore, try to keep the overall number of sentences in the model down to reasonable limits, and also don't make the sentences themselves longer, more complicated or more difficult to understand than necessary. We might consider three and twelve the outer limits for the number of sentences; about halfway between these extremes would be good in most cases.

==Explaining grammar==

The first rule about explaining a point of grammar is that you should have a very clear idea of what that point is: what it is that the learner needs to understand at this stage in the learning sequence. This means both not giving superfluous information but also not omitting essential information.

The explanation should be as clear and concise as possible, but also easy to understand. If the subject matter is found to be too complicated to explain clearly in a few lines, this may be a sign that it needs to be divided up into smaller blocks and possibly distributed over more than one lesson.

We should try to avoid over-use of abbreviations, or difficult terminology, or very abstract formulations, all of which may be just as helpful for some learners but may present a daunting obstacle for others who are less developed intellectually or simply unaccustomed to such texts, but who also may look to our course for help learning about the language.

But we also want to avoid overloading our explanations with a fancy, flowery or over-colloquial style of exposition (the latter is actually just another form of pedantry that most readers will find irritating rather than helpful).

For most learners, actually learning the rules of the language is hard work enough. To package the information needed to do so in meaningful, bite-sized portions is to the would-be learner a great service and shows respect for the strenuous effort they may be making by reading your text in the first place. Don't waste their time and distract their attention with unhelpful information or empty talk. For example, don't keep telling them how easy the rules are (they probably won't believe you), or how difficult they are (stop showing off!). Don't keep insisting on how important it is to learn something (you're pressuring them), but don't tell them it doesn't really matter if they don't understand something (if that is true, perhaps you shouldn't be telling them it!). You don't want to be boring, but that doesn't mean you have to try to be funny; after all, the reader is coming to you for language instruction, not to be entertained.

It may be true that learning is fun, but if it is then help them to learn, and leave it to them have the fun.

==Composing mini-exercises==

The &quot;mini-exercises&quot; are built into the basic architecture of this course and should be considered an essential component, since their purpose is to provide learners with an immediate opportunity to try out what they have just learnt - &quot;before they forget it&quot;, so to speak. They are meant to be tackled immediately upon looking at the new material (the models and the explanations) both to check whether they have taken it in and to help fix it in their minds by putting it to immediate use. They will help readers to become more familiar with the point being learnt, and therefore better prepared to continue on and study the next point.

As with the model and the commentary, the first requirement for producing a good exercise is to have one's mind clearly focused on what point is being studied. The point of the exercise is to reinforce that point and to permit the learner to find out whether she or he has really learnt it or not.

Different techniques can be used for this, resulting in different exercise types. It is a good thing to vary the exercise types, both in order to make the learning process less tedious and, more importantly still, to make the learner &quot;exercise different brain muscles&quot;, as it were - rather as with physical exercise, in fact. Some ideas for exercise types follow (this is not exhaustive!), and one can also benefit from looking at lessons and analysing how the various exercises proposed work and how each helps the learner in different ways.
{{miskito_generic_table|Ten exercise types|
*'''Miskito-English translation:''' You give the Miskito, the learner gives the English.
*'''English-Miskito translation:''' You give the English, the learner gives the Miskito.
*'''Sentence transformation:''' You give a sentence, the learner changes it in the way you specify (e.g. changing singular to plural).
*'''Answering questions:''' You ask questions (in Miskito), the learner answers them (in Miskito).
*'''Combining:''' You give one or more elements of a Miskito sentence (but not the whole sentence), the learner gives the whole sentence combining or manipulating the elements in the way you have specified.
*'''Filling in blanks:''' You give Miskito sentences with a part missing, the learner provides the missing part and completes the sentence.
*'''True or false:''' You give Miskito sentences, the learner says if what they say is right or wrong.
*'''Order the words:''' You give a Miskito sentence with the words in the wrong order, the learner puts them in the right order to form a sentence.
*'''Order the sentences:''' You give a series of Miskito sentences out of order, the learner puts them into the right order to form a coherent text.
*'''Think of your own:
}}

Bear in mind that you will only be able to give the right answers (with the implication that other answers are probably wrong) if the exercise is of such a type that each question only has a single correct answer. And remember that the objective here is to &quot;force&quot; the learner to try to apply the point being learnt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In two-sector macroeconomic models, a '''Harrod-Johnson diagram''' is a way of visualizing the relationship between the output price ratios, the input price ratios, and the endowment ratio of the two goods.  Often the goods are a consumption and investment good, and this diagram shows what will happen to the price ratio if the endowment changes.  The diagram juxtaposes a graph which has input price ratios as its horizontal axis, endowment ratios as its positive vertical axis, and output price ratios as its negative vertical axis.  This may seem unintuitive, but by doing this, it is easier to see the relationship between the output price ratios and the endowment.  The diagram is named after economists, Roy F. Harrod and Harry G. Johnson.

==Derivation==
[[Image:Harrod-Johnson_diagram.png|frame|right|Harrod-Johnson diagram with linear relationship between &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and increasing relationship between ''p'' and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.  Here increasing the endowment causes the price ratios to increase.]]
If we let our good 1 be an investment good, governed by the equation
&lt;math&gt;Y_1=F_1(K,L)\,&lt;/math&gt;

and good 2 be a consumption good:
&lt;math&gt;Y_s=F_s(K,L)\,&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate rental and wage rates, we optimize a representative firm's profit function, giving
&lt;math&gt;p_1 D_K[F_1(K,L)]=r=p_2 D_K[F_2(K,L)]\,&lt;/math&gt; for the rental rate of capital, ''r'', and
&lt;math&gt;p_1 D_L[F_1(K,L)]=w=p_2 D_L[F_2(K,L)]\,&lt;/math&gt; for the wage rate of labor, ''w''.

so the input price ratio, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math&gt;\omega=w/r=\frac{p_i D_L[F_i(K,L)],p_i D_K[F_i(K,L)]}\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=\{1,2\}&lt;/math&gt;
Normalizing this equation by letting &lt;math&gt;k_i = K_i/L_i&lt;/math&gt;, and solving for &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; gives us the formulas to be graphed in the first quadrant.

On the other hand, normalizing the equation
&lt;math&gt;p_1 D_K[F_1(K,L)]=p_2 D_K[F_2(K,L)]\,&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;p_1 D_L[F_1(K,L)]=p_2 D_L[F_2(K,L)]\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is presumably equivalent),
and solving for the price ratio, &lt;math&gt;p_1/P_2&lt;/math&gt; gives the formula which is to be graphed in the fourth quadrant.

With these three functions graphed together, we can see our relationship.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
We have a Bellman equation and first we want to know if there exists a value function that satisfies the equation and second we want to know the properties of such a solution.  In order to answer the question we will define a mapping which maps a function to another function, and a fixed point of the mapping is to be a solution.  The mapping we discussed is a mapping on the set of functions, which is a bit abstract.  So today we will look at the math review.

So first we consider a set, &lt;math&gt;S \subset \mathbb{R}^l&lt;/math&gt;,  For us what it will be relevant to describe a sort of distance between any two points in a set.  We will use the concept of a metric.

=== Metric ===
A '''metric''' is a function &lt;math&gt;\rho :S \times S \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with the properties that it is non-negative, &lt;math&gt; \rho( x, y) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, symmetric, &lt;math&gt;\rho(x,y) = \rho(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;, and satisfies the triangle inequality,&lt;math&gt;\rho(x,z) \leq \rho(x,y) + \rho(y,z)&lt;/math&gt;,


A common metric is euclidean distance, &lt;math&gt;\rho_E (x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^l (x_i-y_i)^2} &lt;/math&gt;,  Another is &lt;math&gt; \rho_{max} (x,y) = \max_{1\leq i\leq l} x_i-y_i &lt;/math&gt;,

=== Space ===
A '''space''', is a set of objects equipped with some general properties and structure


We may be interested in a metric space, a space with a metric such as, &lt;math&gt;(S, \rho)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all bounded rational functions, and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is some distance function.  Once we have a metric space we can discuss convergence and continuity.

=== convergence ===
A sequence, &lt;math&gt;\{x_i\} \subset S&lt;/math&gt;, '''converges''' to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_i \rightarrow x&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; \forall \epsilon &gt; 0, \exists N_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; s.t. &lt;math&gt;\rho(x_n,y_n)&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;N_{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;,


=== Cauchy sequence ===
A sequence , &lt;math&gt;\{x_i\} \subset S&lt;/math&gt;, is called a '''Cauchy sequence''' if &lt;math&gt; \forall \epsilon &gt; 0, \exists N_\epsilon s.t. \rho(x_n,y_m)&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n,m&gt;N_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;,


Question: does every Cauchy sequence converge?

=== Completeness ===
The metric space, &lt;math&gt;(S, \rho)&lt;/math&gt; is '''complete''' if every Cauchy sequence converges.

=== examples of completeness ===
* &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}, \rho_E)&lt;/math&gt; is complete.
* &lt;math&gt;((0,1),\rho_E)&lt;/math&gt; is not complete.  Proof: let &lt;math&gt;x_n = \frac{1}{n+2}&lt;/math&gt;, So &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; os Cauchy, but does not converge to a point in our set &lt;math&gt;(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;([0,1],\rho_E)&lt;/math&gt; is complete. Are all closed sets complete?  A closed subspace of a complete space is complete.
* &lt;math&gt;(\{0,1,2\},\rho_E)&lt;/math&gt; is complete.


== Contraction Mapping ==
A mappting &lt;math&gt;T:S \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is a '''contraction mapping''' on a metric space, &lt;math&gt;(S, \rho)&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\exists o \geq \beta &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\rho(tx, Ty) \leq \beta \rho(x,y) \forall x,y\in S&lt;/math&gt;,  Sometimes we write &lt;math&gt;T(x)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;TX&lt;/math&gt;,


This means that any two points in our set, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, are mapped such that after the mapping the distance between the points shrinks.

=== examples of contraction mapping ===
* &lt;math&gt;Tx=.9x&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction mapping on &lt;math&gt;[(0,1],\rho_E)&lt;/math&gt;,


Now we state the '''contraction mapping theorem'''.

=== Contraction mapping theorem ===
If &lt;math&gt;(S, \rho)&lt;/math&gt; is complete and &lt;math&gt;T:s \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction mapping, then &lt;math&gt;\exists !x^*&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;Tx^*=x^*&lt;/math&gt;,


We will prove this theorem for a general metric space later on.  However, we must remember that it is necessary for this proof that the space be complete.

Let us now look at a criteria to verify that a mapping is a contraction mapping.

=== Contraction Mapping criteria ===
For &lt;math&gt;S \subset \mathbb{R}^l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho=\rho_E&lt;/math&gt;,  Let &lt;math&gt;T:S\rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the following two conditions:
* (M, monotonic condition)&lt;math&gt;\forall x=(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_l)\in S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_l)\in S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T=(T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_l&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x_i \geq y_i\Leftrightarrow x\geq y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;T_i x \geq T_i y \Leftrightarrow Tx \geq Ty&lt;/math&gt;,
* (D, discout condition) &lt;math&gt;\forall x=(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_l)\in S&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\underline{\vec{a}}=(a, a, \ldots, a)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_i(x_1+a, x_2+a, \ldots, x_l + a) \leq T_i(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_l)+\beta a \forall i \Leftrightarrow T(x+\underline{a}) \leq TX + \beta \underline{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction mapping.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Dark Is Rising Sequence''' is a series of 5 books written by [[w:Susan Cooper|Susan Cooper]], aimed at young readers. The books are set in late 20th century England and Wales, but refer to British history. The purpose of this book is to provide background information for the history and geography of the books.

==Strategy== 
To get started, a list of terms and characters can be created. 
*Non fictional terms can be expanded upon using imports from wikipedia, which can then be modified to fit into this book
*Character descriptions, plot summaries, and fictional terms can be compiled following the style of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]].

==Audience==
This book should be addressed to young readers (perhaps ages 11 and up), for use as a personal study guide or as a classroom teacher's guide.

==Books==
===Over Sea, Under Stone===
Three children find a map, and go in search of the treasure it leads to. However, they are soon drawn into the long battle between the Dark and the Light.

===The Dark is Rising===
Will Stanton turns 11 years old, and learns of his true nature as an Old One.

===Greenwitch===
The Drews return to Cornwall just in time for the annual ceremony of the Greenwitch.

===The Grey King===
After a terrible illness, Will Stanton is sent to stay with relatives in Wales to regain his strength. Instead, his time in Wales becomes one of his greatest challenges.

===Silver on the Tree===
The Drews, Will, Bran and Merriman come together for the battle to end all battles between Light and Dark

==Characters==
*Barney Drew
*Jane Drew
*Simon Drew
*Merriman Lyon
*Will Stanton
*Bran Davies

==Geography==
*Cornwall
*Wales
*Thames (the river)

==History==
*Saxons
*Danes
*King Arthur
*Merlin
*The London Blitz

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Device setup

Device: SAT

Device code: 1206

Keys and functions:
(I noted where the OFA key works out-of-the-box using the above device code and where I've needed to use Key Magic and a 5-digit code to map it to a Toppy function)

 Number keys : Work
 -/-- : 00246 Recall
 Magic -/-- 00420 Opt
 AV : 00357 PiP
 Magic AV : PiP Swap 00486

 Vol + : 00313 Vol+
 Vol - : 00500 Vol-
 Mute : Works
 Menu : Works
 Ch + : 00698 Ch+
 Ch - : 00426 Ch-

 Arrow keys : Works
 OK : Works

 Rew : Works
 Play : Works
 Pause : Works
 Ffwd : Works

 Prev Track : 00615 Text
 Stop : Works
 Rec : 00299 Record
 Next track : 00553 Slow

 Red : 00296 Red
 Green : Works
 Yellow : Works
 Blue : Works

 Guide : Works
 i : Works
 ? : 00436 List (N.B. 00506 is not identical to the Toppy's LIST)
 Back : 00440 Exit

 PPV : 00617 Archive
 Subt : 00565 TV/SAT
 Radio : 00683 TV/Radio
 Fav : 00036 White

* Setting the URC-7555 to the basic setup code: press Sat, press and hold Magic until 2 blinks, enter 1206.

* Setting a Key Magic button using the above 5 digit codes (e.g. Rec): press Sat, press and hold Magic until 2 blinks, enter 994, press Magic, enter 00299, press Rec.

* To undo a Key Magic assignment (e.g. Rec): press Sat, press and hod Magic until 2 blinks, enter 994, press Rec twice.

* A picture of the Toppy remote plus codes overlaid on the buttons is below. Codes are given as three digits (just add 00xxx for remotes accepting 5-digit codes). Those in white are the ones thought to be in setup code SAT/1206:
http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/dload.php?action=download&amp;file_id=4154

* OFA say that the 7555 can be returned to OFA for an upgrade (the over-the-phone upgrade does not work) so that all the keys work via device codes VCR 1724 or SAT 1824. The upgrade service is free of charge (for both upgrade and postage back) within the first year of purchasing your One For All, provided you still have the proof of purchase.
If your One For All has been purchased longer than 1 year ago, or if you don't have the proof of purchase anymore, the upgrade service is still possible at the cost of £10.

Even though 3 might seem like just a constant number, it is in fact an instance of the class Fixnum (which inherits from the class Numeric which inherits from the class Object). The method times comes from Fixnum and does just what it claims to do. 

'''What does it claim to do?'''

I think it would be better to use rand(11) instead of rand * 10. --[[User:Benjamin Meinl|Benjamin Meinl]] 00:20, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The ECMA Standard ===

The second edition of the [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-367.htm ECMA Eiffel Standard] came out in June, 2006. Three compiler projects are supporting this standard. EiffelSoftware's EiffelStudio, the Gobo Eiffel Compiler and &quot;The Eiffel Compiler&quot; tecomp.

===EiffelStudio ===
Available under a dual license for Open Source and commercial projects, EiffelStudio is the granddaddy of Eiffel compilers. Produced by EiffelSoftware (formerly ISE), EiffelStudio emphasizes backward compatibility combined with incremental language enhancements. It is probably the most widely used Eiffel compiler.
   
===Liberty Eiffel ===

2013 a new Compiler based on SmartEiffel is in devolepment. It is the new GNU Eiffel Compiler. 

www.gnu.org/software/liberty-eiffel


=== The Gobo Eiffel Compiler===

An offshoot of the Gobo project, the Gobo Eiffel Compiler, or GEC, is currently under development and as of this writing does not support a full implementation of the language. It does contain a complete parser that supports several versions of the language, including compatibility with EiffelStudio and large portions of the ECMA standard.

These two compilers actually have a close relationship. EiffelSoftware has made extensive use of the Gobo libraries to implement their own compiler. Eric Bezault, the founder of the Gobo project, is working with EiffelSoftware on an open source ELKS library to be shared by both compilers.

=== &quot;The Eiffel Compiler&quot; tecomp ===

The development of &quot;The Eiffel Compiler&quot; tecomp started in 2008. It is a compiler and an interpreter at the same time. It compiles the Eiffel source code into its internal representation and either stores it for later execution or executes it in its virtual machine. Optimized native code can be generated via compilation to C.

=== ELKS ===

ELKS was originally formed to develop standards for Eiffel libraries usable by all Eiffel compilers. It laid out some very solid groundwork for libraries earlier this decade.


(TBD: Provide relevant links for more information on all of the standardization efforts and products.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Usage ==
=== Installation techniques ===

See http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToInstallBusinessTemplates.

=== Difference between Install and Upgrade ===

If you have installed erp5_forge business template, and are a bleeding-edge type, you can from time to time update your system to the latest svn revision - see http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToUseERP5Subversion#update_from_svn.

Usually, the recommended way would be to first update the source code (by running svn_update.sh script), then update all bt5 starting from the more basic ones and on to the application-level, so it'd go more or less like:
* erp5_core
* erp5_xhtml_style
* erp5_mysql_innodb_catalog
* erp5_pdm
* erp5_trade
* ...

== Creation ==

See http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToCreateBusinessTemplates

== Generic Business Templates ==

=== erp5_rss_style ===

Capable of rendering ERP5 data in a format recognizable by RSS readers, very configurable. Can be used in hundreds of ways, for example:
* sale manager can use a news ticker application to monitor new sale orders entered by his team
* while checking your email you can immediately see what's new in document management system
* someone working on a project can use his news reader to see new task being started or completed

=Introduction=

==Abstract==

SwisTrack Multi-Camera Client is a client tool to communicate with several [[SwisTrack]] instances. It is written in [[C++]] using [[wxWidgets]]. Data received by a TCP connection will be merged and synchronized before displaying it on a window. [[SwisTrack]] is the server part of the connection and SwisTrack Multi-Camera Client is the client.


==Zoom / focus function==

You can zoom in and out using the scroll wheel of the mouse. To focus on a specific region click with the right mouse button on that region. The left mouse button is to get several information if clicked on a robot. By clicking the mouse wheel the view will be reset.


=Class hierarchy=

We have 10 classes, where &quot;ClientFrame&quot; is the mean one.


[[Image:SwisTrack-Client-hierarchy.png|800px|SwisTrack Multi-Camera Client class hierarchy]]


{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
| &lt;b&gt;Name&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Explanation&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| ClientFrame
| Defines a new frame type (main class)
|-
| CommunicationMessage
| Creates new messages that can be send to the robots and the SwisTrack instances.
|-
| CommunicationNMEAInterface
| Interface to parse incoming messages and send outgoing messages
|-
| MapPanel
| Responsible for painting the panel
|-
| Robot
| Creates new robots for communication and painting
|-
| RobotSocketManager
| Responsible for the communication between the robots and the SwisTrack Multi-Camera Client
|-
| SavePosition
| If enabled, saves the positions of the robots each separated in a file 
|-
| STClient
| Defines the application type
|-
| SwisTrack
| Creates new SwisTrack objects for communication and painting the camera areas
|-
| SwisTrackSocketManager
| Responsible for the communication between the SwisTrack instances and the SwisTrack Multi-Camera Client
|}


=Edit Settings=

If you select the menu &quot;Edit/Edit settings&quot; a editing window will pop up and you will be able to change the settings. Beware to the syntax, otherwise the program won't run correctly. Lines that begins with &quot;#&quot; are treated like comments.

The proper syntax of the SwisTrack Multi-Camera Client settings is (with example)):


==SwisTrack==

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
| &lt;b&gt;Type&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Adress:port;&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Reference point (x,y);&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Vector 1 (x,y);&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Vector 2 (x,y);&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Width, height (w,h);&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| cam:
| localhost:3000;
| 2,3;
| 1,0;
| 0,1;
| 4,6
|}


==Robot==

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
| &lt;b&gt;Type&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Adress:port;&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;id&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| robot:
| 127.0.0.1:4002;
| 5
|}


Watch that after a type follows always a &quot;:&quot; and else after every entry follows a &quot;;&quot; except for the last one where nothing follows. Have a look on the screenshots for an real example.


==Save tracking positions: file syntax==

If desired, the movements of the robots can be saved on a &quot;robotX.txt&quot; file (X is the id of the robot). A line per frame will be used. The syntax is the following:


frame number, position in x, position in y, angle

example: 217,0.669787,8.297836, 6.210000


=Camera area definition=

As seen above we use a reference point with 2 vectors, a width and height for defining a camera area.


[[Image:SwisTrack-Client-amera.png|500px|SwisTrack Multi-Camera Client camera setting]]


=NMEA 0183 protocol=

The SwisTrack Multi-Camera Client uses the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA NMEA 0183] protocol to communicate with the [[SwisTrack]] instances and the robots.


==SwisTrack==

Keep in mind that every command is encapsulated in a message with a message header (command) and a list of arguments according to the specific command. Every command begins with a $ and is in capitals.


===Sending commands===

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
| &lt;b&gt;Command&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Arguments&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| $START
| None
| Initiates the SwisTrack instances and sets the current frame number to 0, but doesn't process anything till $STEP is send.
|-
| $STOP
| None
| Stops the current tracking and resets the current frame number to 0.
|-
| $STEP
| None
| Indicates to the SwisTrack instances to process a next image frame.
|}

The program can be paused (not sending $STEP commands any more) and be resumed by the menu commands under &quot;ST controls/Pause tracking&quot; and &quot;ST controls/Resume tracking&quot;.


===Receiving commands===

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
| &lt;b&gt;Command&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Arguments&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| $PARTICLE
| int id, double x, double y, double angle
| Every robot recognized on a frame is send separately with these parameters 
|-
| $BEGINFRAME
| int frameNb
| Indicates that the data that arrives after this command belongs to the frame number send
|-
| $ENDFRAME
| None
| Indicates that the current processing frame is completed and finished
|}

Remark: One or several $PARTICLE commands can only be received between a $BEGINFRAME and a $ENDFRAME command!


==Robot==

===Sending commands===

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
| &lt;b&gt;Command&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Arguments&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| $STATUS
| None
| Get the current status of the robot (for example: tracking, idle, searching).
|-
| $POSITION
| double position x, double position y
| Reset the current position of the robot.
|}

===Receiving commands===

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
| &lt;b&gt;Command&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Arguments&lt;/b&gt;
| &lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| $STATUS
| string status
| Returns its current status.
|}


=Screenshots=

Here are some screenshots taken from the SwisTrack Multi-Camera Client:

&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{MatlabNav}}

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

'''Octave''' is a free computer program for performing numerical computations (created as part of the GNU project) which is mostly compatible with MATLAB.

== History ==
The project was conceived around 1988.  At first it was intended to be a companion to a chemical reactor design course.
Real development was started by John W. Eaton in 1992.  The first alpha release dates back to January 4, 1993 and on February 17, 1994 version 1.0 was released.

The name has nothing to do with music.  It was the name of a former professor of one of the authors of Octave who was known for his ability to quickly come up with good approximations to numerical problems.

== Technical details ==
* Octave is written in C++ using STL libraries.
* Octave has an interpreter that interprets the Octave language.
* Octave itself is extensible using dynamically loadable modules.
* Octave interpreter works in tandem with gnuplot and Grace software to create plots, graphs, and charts, and to save or print them.

== Octave, the language ==
The Octave language is an interpreted programming language.  It is a structured programming language (an example of which is the C language) and supports many common C standard library constructs, and can be extended to support UNIX system calls and functions.  However, it does not support passing arguments by reference.

Octave programs consist of a list of function calls or script.
The language is matrix-based and provides various functions for matrix operation.  It is not object-oriented, but supports data structures.

Its syntax is very similar to MATLAB, and carefully programming a script will allow it to run on both Octave and MATLAB.

Because Octave is made available under the GNU General Public License, it may be freely copied and used. The program runs under most Unix and Unix-like operating systems, as well as Microsoft Windows.

== Notable features ==
* '''Command and variable name completion'''
Typing a TAB character on the command line causes Octave to attempt to complete variable, function, and file names. Octave uses the text before the cursor as the initial portion of the name to complete. 

* '''Command history'''
When running interactively, Octave saves the commands typed in an internal buffer so that they can be recalled and edited. 

* '''Data structures'''
Octave includes a limited amount of support for organizing data in structures. For instance:
&lt;pre&gt;
octave:1&gt; x.a = 1; x.b = [1, 2; 3, 4]; x.c = &quot;string&quot;;
octave:2&gt; x.a
x.a = 1
octave:3&gt; x.b
x.b =

  1  2
  3  4

octave:4&gt; x.c
x.c = string
&lt;/pre&gt;

* '''Short-circuit boolean operators'''
Octave's `&amp;&amp;' and `||' logical operators are evaluated in a short-circuit fashion (like the corresponding operators in the C language) and work differently than the element by element operators `&amp;' and `|'.

* '''Increment and decrement operators'''
Octave includes the C-like increment and decrement operators `++' and `--' in both their prefix and postfix forms. 

* '''Unwind-protect'''
Octave supports a limited form of exception handling modelled after the unwind-protect form of [[Lisp]]. The general form of an unwind_protect block looks like this: 
&lt;pre&gt;
unwind_protect
  body
unwind_protect_cleanup
  cleanup
end_unwind_protect
&lt;/pre&gt;

* '''Variable-length argument lists'''
Octave has a real mechanism for handling functions that take an unspecified number of arguments without explicit upper limit. 

Here is an example of a function that uses the new syntax to print a header followed by an unspecified number of values: 
&lt;pre&gt;
function foo (heading, ...)
  disp (heading);
  va_start ();
  while (--nargin)
    disp (va_arg ());
  endwhile
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

* '''Variable-length return lists'''
Octave also has a real mechanism for handling functions that return an unspecified number of values. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;
function [...] = foo (n)
  for i = 1:n
    vr_val (i);
  endfor
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Octave has been mainly built with MATLAB compatibility in mind. It has a lot of features in common with MATLAB:

# Matrices as fundamental data type.
# Built-in support for complex numbers.

Some of the differences that do exist between Octave and MATLAB can be worked around using &quot;user preference variables.&quot;

GNU Octave is mostly compatible with Matlab. However, Octave's parser allows some (often very useful) syntax that Matlab's does not, so programs written for Octave might not run in Matlab. For example, Octave supports the use of both single and double quotes. Matlab only supports single quotes, which means parsing errors will occur if you try to use double quotes (e.g. in an Octave script when run on Matlab). Octave and Matlab users who must collaborate with each other need to take note of these issues and program accordingly.

:''Note:'' Octave can be run in &quot;traditional mode&quot; (by including the &lt;tt&gt;--traditional&lt;/tt&gt; flag when starting Octave) which makes it give an error when certain Octave-only syntax is used.

This chapter documents instances where Matlab's parser will fail to run code that will run in Octave, and instances where Octave's parser will fail to run code that will run in Matlab. This page also contains notes on differences between things that are different between Octave (in traditional mode) and Matlab. 

==C-Style Autoincrement and Assignment operators==
Octave supports C-style autoincrement and assignment operators:
   i++; ++i; i+=1; etc.
MatLab does not.

==Temporaries==
Octave and Matlab support temporary expressions.
&lt;code&gt;
   tmp = size(mtx);
   columns = tmp(2);         %  works in both
   columns = size(mtx)(2);   %  works in Octave, fails in Matlab
   columns = size(mtx,2);    %  works in both
&lt;/code&gt;

==Product of booleans==
Matlab (R2011b) and Octave (3.6.4) responds differently when computing the product of boolean values:

   X = ones(2,2) ; prod(size(X)==1) 
 
   Matlab: PROD is only supported for floating point input.
   Octave: ans = 0

==nargin==
Nargin returns the number of input arguments of a function.
Matlab (R2011b) will not allow the following; Octave will.

  function myfun = testfun(c)
    if (nargin == 1)
      nargin = 2;
    else
      nargin = 3
  end

==startup.m==

Matlab will execute a file named 'startup.m' in the directory it was called from on the command line. Octave does not. It will, however, execute a file named '.octaverc' which can be edited to execute existing files. This means that '.octaverc' can be edited to look for and execute a 'startup.m' file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
if ( exist ('startup.m', 'file') )
  source ('startup.m')  # load startup.m like matlab
endif
&lt;/source&gt;

==['abc ';'abc']==

['abc ';'abc'] is allowed in Octave; Matlab returns: ?? Error using ==&gt; vertcat

In Octave the result will be a 2 by 3 matrix.

== Calling Shells ==
the &quot;! STRING&quot; syntax calls a shell with command STRING in Matlab. Octave does not recognize ! as system call, since it is used in logical operations. Always use 'system (STRING)' for compatibility.

If you really miss the one-character shortcut, for convenience on the command line you can create a similar shortcut by defining the following in your '.octaverc' file:

   function S(a), system(a); end

Now &quot;S STRING&quot; will evaluate the string in the shell.

==Attempting to load empty files==

MATLAB lets you load empty files, OCTAVE does not.

system('touch emptyfile') ; A = load('emptyfile')

   Matlab R2011b : A=[]
   Octave 3.6.2  : error: load: file `emptyfile' seems to be empty!
                   error: load: unable to extract matrix size from file `emptyfile'

== fprintf and printf ==

Matlab doesn't support `printf' as a command for printing to the screen.

    foo = 5;
    printf ('My result is: %d\n', foo) % prints to STDOUT. Octave only

If using Matlab, `fprintf' covers writing both to the screen and to a file by omitting the optional file-handle argument:

    foo = 5;
    fprintf('My result is: %d\n', foo) % prints to STDOUT, Octave and Matlab

== Whitespace==

Matlab does not allow whitespace before the transpose operator but Octave does (it is just an operator like others).

    [0 1]'   % works in Matlab and Octave
    [0 1] '  % works only in Octave

== Line continuation ==

Matlab always requires `...' for line continuation.

    rand (1, ...
          2)

while Octave ''also'' supports

    rand (1,
          2)

and

    rand (1, \
          2)

== Logical operator NOT ==

Octave allows users to use both ~ and ! with boolean values. The first is for matlab compatibility, while ! will be more familiar to C/Java/etc programmers. If you use the latter, however, you'll be writing code that Matlab will not accept:

* For not-equal comparison, Octave can use both '~=' or '!='. Matlab requires '~='.

== GNU Octave Control Package ==

Both MATLAB and Octave have toolboxes intended to control system design. In Octave, the toolbox is called the Octave Control Package. The package can be downloaded, compiled and installed with the command &lt;tt&gt;pkg install control&lt;/tt&gt;from the Octave prompt. Users of Debian and its derivatives can install it by installing the package &quot;octave-control&quot;, if it is not installed by default.

For more information about functions' syntax, type &lt;tt&gt;help &lt;name of function&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. For more information about the Control Package, view the PDF manual in the package's &quot;doc&quot; folder.

==Some other differences==

* MATLAB uses the percent sign '%' to begin a comment.  Octave uses both the hash symbol '#' and the percent sign '%' interchangeably.
* For exponentiation, Octave can use `^' or `**'; Matlab requires `^'.
* For string delimiters, Octave can use ' or &quot;; Matlab requires '.
* To end blocks, Octave can use `end' or specify the block with `end{if,for, ...}'; Matlab requires `end'.
* Octave supports C-style hexadecimal notation (e.g. &quot;0xF0&quot;); Matlab requires the ''hex2dec'' function (e.g. &quot;hex2dec('F0')&quot;).
* If something (like Netlab) need a function called fcnchk, you can just put the following into a file called fcnchk.m and put it somewhere Octave can find it:

 function f=fcnchk(x, n)
   f = x;
 end

* The main difference is the [http://wiki.octave.org/FAQ#GUI lack of GUI] for Octave. There have been many attempts to solve this issue though they are all eventually abandoned once they no longer work with new Octave versions. There is an experimental GUI as part of Octave already released, which is planned to become official with the next release.

== Notes about specific functions ==

* For &quot;dbstep, in&quot; use &quot;dbstep&quot;; for &quot;dbstep&quot;, use &quot;dbnext&quot;
* For &quot;eig(A,B)&quot; use &quot;qz(A,B)&quot;
* fputs function is not available in MATLAB. Use fprintf instead.
* page_output_immediately = 1 should this be default in --traditional?
* strread and textscan in Octave 3.4.0 are not fully compatible with their implementations in Matlab 2009b (and probably later versions as well). For instance, the N=-1 option (repeat reading format until end of string) is not implemented in Octave 3.4.0 . Using a value of N=a positive integer (read format N times) does work the same as in Matlab.
* textscan function is not included in Octave versions prior to 3.4.0. Use fscanf instead.
* For the linprog function, MATLAB is more permissive by allowing the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; inputs to be either row or column vectors.  Octave requires that they be column vectors.
* In Octave, one can specify data labels (or legends) with the plot function, while in Matlab, one can only use the legend function.

 Octave:        plot(x, y, ';label;')
 Matlab/Octave: plot(x, y); legend('label')

* The error(msg) function in Matlab is a no-op if the message is empty. In Octave, it results in an error.

Since Java 1.2, the Java platform itself comes with a security model built into applications it runs. It provides an access controller similar to what the Java enabled browser provides for an applet.

There are two main ways we can add security to our application. One way is to add a Class loader, or a security manager. The other way is to run your application under an other program, that can be called ''JavaRunner''. JavaRunner can be used to run applications, the same way as ''appletviewer'' is used to run applets.

Permissions in Java grant or deny certain privileges to an application. Take this file from an applet called &quot;[http://desert.sf.net Desert]&quot;:
&lt;source lang=java&gt;
grant {
permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This file says to allow every permission (i.e. no security). Take also this code:
&lt;source lang=java&gt;
import java.io.*;

perm = new FilePermission(&quot;/tmp/wikibooks-test&quot;, &quot;read&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

This represents permission to allow reading of &lt;tt&gt;/tmp/wikibooks-temp&lt;/tt&gt;. For more information see [http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/permissions.html this].

'''Ma'amoul''' are pastries filled with dates or nuts.

==Ingredients==
* 1 lb. (500 g) [[Cookbook:Flour|plain white flour]] (up to a quarter of the flour may be replaced with fine [[Cookbook:Semolina|semolina]])
* 2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Sugar|white sugar]]
* ½ lb. (250 g) unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (Normandy butter is best)
* 1-2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rose water]] or [[Cookbook:Orange#Oranges in Cooking|orange flower water]]
* 2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Water|water]] or [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|icing sugar]]
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]] (optional)

===Pistachio filling===

Mix ½ lb. (250 g) finely chopped [[Cookbook:Pistachio|pistachios]] with a somewhat smaller weight of sugar and 1 tbsp. rose water.  (Some people use ground [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]], with or without green food colouring, instead of pistachios.)

===Walnut filling===

Mix ½ lb. (250 g) finely chopped [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]] with a somewhat smaller weight of sugar and 1 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]].

===Date filling===

Chop 1 lb. (500 g) stoneless [[Cookbook:Date|dates]], and bring to the boil with half a teacup of water, squashing the mixture against the side of the pan with a wooden spoon until approximately uniform in consistency.  Blend with an electric chopper if desired.  One variant is to add some butter to the mixture as it cooks.  Allow to cool.

==Equipment==

Ma'amoul may be made in special wooden moulds.  These should be oiled and wiped, then dusted with flour before use (and after every three to four balls, to prevent sticking).  There are three shapes of mould.  The flattish circular shape is used for date ma’amoul; the round domed shape for walnut ma’amoul; the long oval for pistachio ma’amoul.

Some families do not use moulds, but have special crimping tweezers for making patterns on the top of the pastry.  Alternatively, a fork may be used.

==Procedure==
# Sift the flour into a mixing bowl.    Mix with 2 tablespoons white sugar, and a pinch of salt if desired. Some people add a very small quantity of baking powder.
# Work in the butter until the consistency is as uniform as possible; one way is to heat the butter in the microwave first until it is nearly melted, and then mix it with the flour into a sort of crumble.  Cover and leave for some hours or overnight (not in the fridge, or it will go rock hard).
# Break up the dough with your fingers and add the rose water or orange flower water and 2 tbsp. water or milk until it is malleable, and knead the whole into a smooth ball. 
# Take a walnut-sized ball of the dough, stick your thumb into it and hollow out into a cup shape, so that the walls are as thin as possible without breaking. 
# Insert filling to about three-quarters full, and pinch the aperture closed.  Pat gently into a ball, not letting the walls break. 
# Decorate the ball on top with tweezers or the prongs of a fork.  Alternatively, pat it into a wooden mould and flatten the exposed bottom surface, then bang the mould face down on the work surface to extract the moulded pastry. 
# Repeat the last three steps until all the dough and the filling is used.  If at any stage the remaining dough shows signs of drying out, knead in a little more water or milk.  
# Place the pastries on a baking sheet (not greased, as the dough is already very buttery) and bake in a preheated oven (180°C / 355°F; 160°C if a fan oven) for 20 minutes: they must not be allowed to become hard or brown.  In fact they should look a little moist and underdone when removed from the oven: they will steam off and harden as they cool.
# Leave the pastries to cool, and dust with icing sugar when cold.  Keep in a sealed plastic box or biscuit tin.

==Variants==

The Sephardi Jews of the Eastern Mediterranean refer to date ma'amoul as ''menenas''.  These are often made in the form of date rolls rather than balls.

Another variant, used on very special occasions, is known as ''karabij''.  Make nut ma’amoul, using water rather than milk and no flower water, in the form of balls rather than in a mould, leaving them smooth without making any indentations.  Arrange in a pyramid and serve with a special cream called ''naatiffe''.  This is made by boiling water, lemon juice, sugar, orange flower water and ground soapwort (''Saponaria officinalis'') into a syrup, and folding in stiffly beaten egg whites.  (Some books mention ''bois de Panama'' instead of soapwort, but apparently this is a fallacy.)

This is true for normal people. However, some people age faster than others. [[Wikipedia:Adolescence|Adolescents]] are naive and inexperienced but expected to grow into mature adults in their 20's.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{draft}}

The '''editorial board''' is a group of wikibookians, comprised of a set of standing members and temporary appointees who oversee matters of book publishing and distribution here on wikibooks. 

== Purpose ==

The purpose of the editorial board is to oversee the content of books. The editorial board is tasked with:

#Identifying &quot;experts&quot; in various fields, to aide in editorial tasks.
#Review, edit, and revise notable wikibooks in preparation for eventual publication and distribution.
#Provide assistance and guidance to Wikibookians, when properly solicited, on matters of book content.
#Provide a centralized point of contact between the wikibooks community, the WMF, and the textbook consumers (teachers, students, libraries, publishers, etc).
#Ensure that books, both local and distributed copies, conform to the GFDL.

Book authors may opt to ask the board for assistance in review, editing, publishing, or distributing their books. This is optional, and help from the board is not required to publish or distribute books on Wikibooks. It is hoped, however, that the board will help to facilitate and streamline these processes.

== Composition ==

The editorial board will have two distinct components: a standing core group of active Wikibookians, and an ancillary group of temporary members to lend expertise on various subjects. The size of the editorial board, or of it's two component groups will not be static, nor limited in any way.

=== Standing Members ===

The standing members of the editorial board will be selected by the community. Members of this board are qualified based on their skill and experience in writing book content, and preparing books for publication. Members must be willing to read and write large amounts of book content, as needed.

There are no specific requirements for membership, but all candidates should be able to bring some benefit to the board. The board requires people who can edit and revise books, typeset and produce PDF versions, and people who can work to distribute books. Members must be trusted and responsible, as many of the duties prescribed to the board could have a profound effect on the Wikibooks project. Above all, members of the board should have a strong desire and drive to help Wikibooks succeed.

=== Appointed Members === 

Appointed members of the editorial board are selected on a case-by-case basis to supply subject expertise to the board. These members can be selected from those listed at [[Wikibooks:Volunteer editors]], from known authors here on Wikibooks with expertise in a particular subject, or they can be invited from outside the project. 

Appointed members are not elected, but are instead invited by standing members of the board for help in particular tasks. Proper judgment should be used in selecting qualified volunteers. Appointees are only considered members of the board so long as they are needed for particular tasks. Appointees may certainly continue editing or authoring books here on Wikibooks after their work with the editorial board has completed.

== Membership ==

Wikibookians can be nominated to become standing members of the editorial board at any time. Nominees should be judged based on their contribution history, with special attention paid to content edits. The editorial board requires members who are experienced in editing and authoring book content.

Nominees should receive a number of community votes similar to the number required to elect an admin at that point in time. This metric is approximate, and will certainly change over time. While the number of votes should be consistent with the election of an admin, the standards to which a candidate are judged should be very different. When enough votes have been received, the new member will be confirmed by the board.

Members of the board can similarly be nominated for dismissal from the board at any time. Members of the board are expected to be active on the board, and also be active at Wikibooks in general. Any member can request leave from the board at any time, and all such requests are granted immediately. 

=== Contact Information ===

Because of the nature of copyright and publishing, it may be necessary for members of the editorial board to supply a certain amount of legal contact information. This information will be collected, updated, and stored at the discretion of the board.

As books are published and distributed, it may also be necessary to collect this kind of information from book contributors, to help enforce copyright. Providing such information is always voluntary, and any information collected will not be posted or misused.

== Limitations ==

The editorial board is limited in scope and power. It serves only as an aide to book authors for editing, publishing, distributing and promotion. At no time should the editorial board act outside the wishes of the book authors.

The editorial board carries no &quot;weight&quot; with the community, and members of the board are afforded no additional rights, privledges, or status. The editorial board and the individual members should be cautious not to overstep any bounds of authority.

== Request Review ==

If there is a book worthy of review by the editorial board, nominate them here.

== Request Books ==

If you are a consumer of textbooks (teacher, student, library, etc) and would like to request that an existing Wikibook be published or distributed, you can list your needs here. Other questions or comments should be directed [[Wikibooks talk:Editorial board|to the board's talk page]].

== Dispute Resolution ==

If there is a dispute concerning book content, the editorial board can help act as a mediator. It is not the primary purpose of the board, and it is left up to the discretion of the board as to whether or not to get involved in disputes of this kind. The editorial board has no authority to impose binding solutions on disputes except in the special case of [[Wikibooks:Wikipublish|fixed, published editions]] or where asked to do so by the [[Wikibooks:Arbitration Committee| Arbitration Committee]] or where a formal request for binding review has been made with the agreement of all disputants. Wikibookians in disagreement are encouraged to consult the [[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution]], and [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] policies, as necessary.</text>

      <comment>/* Half Adder */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

== Addition and Subtraction ==

Addition and subtraction are similar algorithms. Taking a look at subtraction, we can see that:

:&lt;Math&gt;a - b = a + (-b)&lt;/math&gt;

Using this simple relationship, we can see that addition and subtraction can be performed using the same hardware. Using this setup, however, care must be taken to invert the value of the second operand if we are performing subtraction. Note also that in twos-compliment arithmetic, the value of the second operand must not only be inverted, but 1 must be added to it. For this reason, when performing subtraction, the carry input into the LSB should be a 1 and not a zero. 

[[Image:4-bit ripple carry adder-subtracter.svg|300px|center]]

Our goal on this page, then, is to find suitable hardware for performing addition.

== Bit Adders ==


=== Half Adder ===

A half adder is a circuit that performs binary addition on two bits.
A half adder does not explicitly account for a carry input signal.

[[Image:Half-adder.svg|center|300px]]

In verilog, a half-adder can be implemented as follows:

 module half_adder(a, b, c, s)
    input a, b;
    output s, c;
    s = a &amp; b;
    c = a ^ b;
 endmodule

=== Full Adder ===

Full adder circuits are similar to the half-adder, except that they do account for a carry input and a carry output. Full adders can be treated as a 3-bit adder with a 2-bit result, or they can be treated as a single stage (a 3:2 compressor) in a larger adder.


[[Image:Full-adder.svg|300px]][[Image:1-bit full-adder.svg|300px]]

As can be seen below, the number of gate delays in a full-adder circuit is 3:

[[Image:Full-adder with gate delay.svg|center|300px]]

We can use verilog to implement a full adder module:

 module full_adder(a, b, cin, cout, s);
    input a, b, cin;
    output cout, s;
    wire temp;
    temp = a ^ b;
    s = temp ^ cin;
    cout = (cin &amp; temp) | (a &amp; b);
 endmodule



== Serial Adder ==

[[Image:Serialadder.png|center|600px]]

A serial adder is a kind of [[../ALU/]] that calculates each bit of the output, one at a time, re-using one full adder (total).
This image shows a 2-bit serial adder, and the associated waveforms.

Serial adders have the benefit that they require the least amount of hardware of all adders, but they suffer by being the slowest.

== Parallel Adder ==

A parallel adder is a kind of [[../ALU/]] that calculates every bit of the output more or less simultaneously, using one full adder for each output bit.
The 1947 Whirlwind computer was the first computer to use a parallel adder.

In many CPUs, the CPU latches the final carry-out of the parallel adder in an external &quot;carry flag&quot; in a &quot;status register&quot;.

In a few CPUs, the latched value of the carry flag is always wired to the first carry-in of the parallel adder;
this gives &quot;Add with carry&quot; with 2s' complement addition.
(In a very few CPUs, an end-around carry -- the final carry-out of the parallel adder is directly connected to the first carry-in of the same parallel adder -- gives 1's complement addition).

=== Ripple Carry Adder ===

[[Image:4-bit ripple carry adder.svg|center|500px]]

Numbers of more than 1 bit long require more then just a single full adder to manipulate using arithmetic and bitwise logic instructions{{fact}}. A simple way of operating on larger numbers is to cascade a number of full-adder blocks together into a '''ripple-carry adder''', seen above. Ripple Carry adders are so called because the carry value &quot;ripples&quot; from one block to the next, down the entire chain of full adders. The output values of the higher-order bits are not correct, and the arithmetic is not complete, until the carry signal has completely propagated down the chain of full adders. 

If each full adder requires 3 gate delays for computation, then an ''n''-bit ripple carry adder will require ''3n'' gate delays. For 32 or 64 bit computers (or higher) this delay can be overwhelmingly large.

Ripple carry adders have the benefit that they require the least amount of hardware of all adders (except for serial adders), but they suffer by being the slowest (except for serial adders).

With the full-adder verilog module we defined above, we can define a 4-bit ripple-carry adder in Verilog. The adder can be expanded logically:

 wire [3:0] c;
 wire [3:0] s;
 full_adder fa1(a[0], b[0], 1'b0, c[0], s[0]);
 full_adder fa2(a[1], b[1], c[0], c[1], s[1]);
 full_adder fa3(a[2], b[2], c[1], c[2], s[2]);
 full_adder fa4(a[3], b[3], c[2], c[3], s[3]);

At the end of this module, ''s'' contains the 4 bit sum, and c[3] contains the final carry out.

This &quot;ripple carry&quot; arrangement makes &quot;add&quot; and &quot;subtract&quot; take much longer than the other operations of an ALU (AND, NAND, shift-left, divide-by-two, etc).
A few CPUs use a ripple carry ALU, and require the programmer to insert NOPs to give the &quot;add&quot; time to settle.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ultratechnology.com/mfp21.htm &quot;MuP21 Machine Forth&quot;: &quot;Ripple Carry on + and +*&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
A few other CPUs use a ripple carry adder, and simply set the clock rate slow enough that there is plenty of time for the carry bits to ripple through the adder.
A few CPUs use a ripple carry adder, and make the &quot;add&quot; instruction take more clocks than the &quot;XOR&quot; instruction, in order to give the carry bits more time to ripple through the adder on an &quot;add&quot;, but without unnecessarily slowing down the CPU during a &quot;XOR&quot;.
However, it makes pipelining much simpler if every instruction takes the same number of clocks to execute.

=== Carry Skip Adder ===

=== Carry Lookahead Adder ===

[[Image:4-bit carry lookahead adder.svg|center|500px]]

{{wikipedia|Carry look-ahead adder}}

Carry-lookahead adders use special &quot;look ahead&quot; blocks to compute the carry from a group of 4 full-adders, and passes this carry signal to the next group of 4 full adders.  Lookahead units can also be cascaded, to minimize the number of gate delays to completely propagate the carry signal to the end of the chain. Carry lookahead adders are some of the fastest adder circuits available, but they suffer from requiring large amounts of hardware to implement. The number of transistors needed to implement a carry-lookahead adder is proportional to the number of inputs cubed.

The addition of two 1-digit inputs &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt; is said to ''generate'' if the addition will always carry, regardless of whether there is an input carry (equivalently, regardless of whether any less significant digits in the sum carry).  For example, in the decimal addition 52 + 67, the addition of the tens digits 5 and 6 ''generates'' because the result carries to the hundreds digit regardless of whether the ones digit carries (in the example, the ones digit clearly does not carry).

In the case of binary addition, &lt;math&gt;A + B&lt;/math&gt; generates if and only if both &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt; are 1.  If we write &lt;math&gt;G(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; to represent the binary predicate that is true if and only if &lt;math&gt;A + B&lt;/math&gt; generates, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;G(A,B) = A \cdot B&lt;/math&gt;

The addition of two 1-digit inputs &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt; is said to ''propagate'' if the addition will carry whenever there is an input carry (equivalently, when the next less significant digit in the sum carries).  For example, in the decimal addition 37 + 62, the addition of the tens digits 3 and 6 ''propagate'' because the result would carry to the hundreds digit ''if'' the ones were to carry (which in this example, it does not).  Note that propagate and generate are defined with respect to a single digit of addition and do not depend on any other digits in the sum.

In the case of binary addition, &lt;math&gt;A + B&lt;/math&gt; propagates if and only if at least one of &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; or &lt;var&gt;B &lt;/var&gt; is 1.  If we write &lt;math&gt;P(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; to represent the binary predicate that is true if and only if &lt;math&gt;A + B&lt;/math&gt; propagates, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A,B) = A + B&lt;/math&gt;

=== Cascading Adders ===

The power of carry-lookahead adders is that the bit-length of the adder can be expanded without increasing the propagation delay too much. By cascading lookahead modules, and passing &quot;propagate&quot; and &quot;generate&quot; signals to the next level of the lookahead module. For instance, once we have 4 adders combined into a simple lookahead module, we can use that to create a 16-bit and a 64-bit adder through cascading:

[[Image:16-bit lookahead carry unit.svg|center|500px|frame|The 16-Bit carry lookahead unit is exactly the same as the 4-bit carry lookahead adder.]]

[[Image:64-bit lookahead carry unit.svg|center|500px|frame|the 64-bit carry lookahead unit is exactly the same as the 4-bit and 16-bit units. This means that once we have designed one carry lookahead module, we can cascade it to any large size.]]

=== Generalized Cascading ===

[[Image:Cla4bitsPG.png|center|frame|A generalized CLA block diagram. Each of the turquoise blocks represents a smaller CLA adder.]]

[[Image:Cla16bitsPG.png|center|thumb|600px|We can cascade the generalized CLA block above to form a larger CLA block. This larger block can then be cascaded into a larger CLA block using the same method.]]

== Shift and Rotate ==

Shift and rotate blocks are essential elements in most processors. They are useful on their own, but they also are used in multiplication and division modules. In a binary computer, a left shift has the same effect as a multiplication by 2, and a right shift has the same effect as a division by 2. Since shift and rotate operations perform much more quickly then multiplication and division, they are useful as a tool in program optimization.

== Logical Shift ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 |-
 |[[Image:Rotate left logically.svg]]
 |[[Image:Rotate right logically.svg]]
 |-
 !A left logical shift
 !A right logical shift
|}

In a logical shift, the data is shifted in the appropriate direction, and a zero is shifted into the new location.

== Arithmetic shift ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|[[Image:Rotate right arithmetically.svg]]
|-
!A right arithmetic shift
|}

In an arithmetic shift, the data is shifted right so that the sign of the data item is preserved. This means that the MSB is the value that is shifted into the new position. An arithmetic left shift is the same as a logical left shift, and is therefore not shown here.

== Rotations ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 |-
 |[[Image:Rotate left.svg]]
 |[[Image:Rotate right.svg]]
 |-
 !A left rotation
 !A right rotation
|}

A rotation is like a shift, except the bit shifted off the end of the register is then shifted into the new spot.

== Fast Shift Implementations ==

The above images in each section help to indicate a method to shift a register more quickly, at the expense of requiring additional hardware. Instead of having one register that attempts to shift in place, we have have two registers in parallel, with wires connecting the various blocks together. When a shift is indicated, gates open that allow the data to pass from one register to the next, the proper number of spaces forward or backward.

In practice, fast shift blocks are implemented as a &quot;barrel shifter&quot;. The barrel shifter includes several &quot;levels&quot; of multiplexers, each connected to the previous one by straight wires (wires that transfer the data without a shift), and wires that cause a shift by successive powers of two. For instance, the first level of shift would be 4 spaces, the next level would be 2 spaces, and the last level would be 1 space. In this way, the value of each shift level corresponds to the binary representation of the number of spaces to shift. This implementation makes for very fast shifters that can shift an arbitrary number of spaces in a single clock cycle.

== Multiply and Divide Problems ==

Multiplication and Division operations are significantly more complicated then addition or subtraction operations. This additional complexity leads to more hardware, more complicated hardware, and longer processing time.

In hardware, multiplication and division are performed by a series of sequential additions and arithmetic shifts. for this reason, it is imperative that we have efficient adders and shifters at our disposal.

Multipliers and dividers are composed of shifters and adders. It is typically not possible, or not desirable to to use the main adder and shifter units of the ALU, so a microprocessor will typically have multiple ALU units (a primary unit for addition and subtraction, and units embedded in the multiplication and division units). These are other good reasons why our ALU and shifters need to be small and fast.

== Multiplication Algorithms ==

=== Booth's Algorithm ===

=== Cascaded Multiplication ===

== Division Algorithm ==

== Multiply and Accumulate ==

'''Multiply and accumulate''' (MAC) operations perform a multiplication and an addition in a single instruction. For instance, the instruction:

 MAC A, B, C

Would perform the operation:

 A = A + (B &amp;times; C)

This is valuable for math-intensive processors, such as graphics processors and DSPs. 

An MAC tends to have a long critical path, so if your processor has an MAC operation it is probably possible to include other complicated arithmetic operations.

In a processor with an accumulator architecture, MAC operations will use the accumulator as the destination register, so the instruction:

 MAC B, C

Will perform the operation:

 ACC = ACC + (B &amp;times; C)
=== Fused Multiply-Add ===

A '''fused multiply-add''' operation is a floating-point operation that is similar to the MAC. However, in the fused operation, the floating-point values are not rounded between the multiply and the add, they are rounded afterwards. For more information about floating-point rounding, see [[Floating Point]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Royal Scottish Country Dance Society (RSCDS) in Edinburg, Scotland, was founded in 1923 by Mrs. Ysabel Stewart and Miss Jean Milligan. (More at: http://delval.rscds.us/1reelscot.html)

The RSCDS is an international organization and would take grave exception, I am sure, to this entry as it now stands linking the Contradance tightly to Scottish Country Dancing. There clearly is a relationship between them, as there is to the English Country Dance, and, more distantly to other group dances such as the Morris, and the many dance traditions of Europe. But the Scottish rightly consider theirs to be a unique and separate tradition unto itself that is more tightly maintained to this day and most.

As it happens, I have been a Scottish Country Dancer for more than 50 years and had the privelege of dancing with, and being taught (briefly) by the Founder of the modern  RSCDS by Miss Milligan, herself. On more than one occassion I have heard her proclaim in no uncertain terms, &quot;Scottish Dancing is NOT 'folk dancing' as there are NO folk in Scotland!  These dances derive from the French ballet!&quot;  And, indeed they do, as any teacher certificated by the RSCDS will tell you.

Here is a brief excerpt from the Scottish Country Dance entry in the English Wikipedia:

:...in 1923 the Scottish Country Dance Society (SCDS) (affectionately called &quot;the Society&quot;) was founded in Glasgow with the goal of preserving &quot;country dances as danced in Scotland&quot; (this was only recently changed to read &quot;Scottish country dances&quot;). The SCDS began to collect and publish the remaining dances as well as reconstruct (or reinterpret) dances from old sources that were no longer being danced. In the process, the dances and technique, which might differ considerably depending on where in Scotland a dance would be collected, were strictly standardized, which from the point of view of preservation was of course a terrible thing to do, but which paved the way for universal &quot;compatibility&quot; between dancers from (eventually) all over the world. The efforts of the SCDS became quite popular, and its influence on the training of physical education teachers meant that most Scottish children would be exposed to at least a minimum of SCD during school. The Society achieved Royal patronage in 1947 and henceforth became known as the RSCDS (for &quot;Royal&quot; Scottish Country Dance Society).&quot;

Another account states:
:The Edinburgh-based society was founded in 1923 when two Scottish women, Mrs. Ysabel Stewart and Miss Jean Milligan, worried that with the advent of the radio and phonograph the old dances were fated to die out, put their heads together and decided to collect and preserve them. Today, boasting over 25,000 members, the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society is a worldwide organization whose purpose is to encourage this colorful tradition among people of all nationalities. There are branches throughout Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia as well as in New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies and Hong Kong and Japan.

My preference would be to have a specific entry for Scottish AND an entry for the Contradance, which also has a long although perhaps less well documented provenance. With references and  cross  links between them and among other related group dances. 

A close reading of the history of group dancing will show that a number well preserved, common figures and dance patterns go back well over 1,000 years and are to be found in the dances of the Eastern Europe, Greece, the Middle East, and Scandianvia.

== Review: Great first draft, needs tweaking and I'd like to help ==

     Contra dancers have a head start in learning SCD, because they already know many of the figures, although in slightly different forms and by different names, and they know how to move to the music as part of a team of dancers. They know that dancing is fun, and they've already learned eye contact, covering, handing, how to form a longways set with the music at the top, and timing figures to eight bars of music. What they will find intimidating are the steps, particular music for particular dances, re-learning figures and handing in SCD style, and having to remember the dance from a talk-through before the music starts instead of relying on a caller. But experienced contra dancers will incorporate the additional elements of SCD more quickly than beginners who have never done set dancing to Celtic music. 

     There is always a moment of epiphany in learning SCD, when new dancers realize they're not thinking about the dozen things  they're doing at the same time, just dancing effortlessly, with joy. This may happen during the third class, or the twentieth, or later, but it'll happen sooner if the beginner is an experienced contra dancer. Contra dancers already know the learning shortcuts: dancing with a more experienced partner, ignoring the feet and looking up, taking cues from other dancers, hearing the music tell what to do, and concentrating on being in the right place at the right time. Groking the steps comes last.

     What I tell my beginners is to remember how they learned to drive. They had to juggle many things at the same time—controlling the car, remembering the traffic laws, watching the other drivers, avoiding suicidal deer—but at one point the new driver had a moment of epiphany, a realization that the driving was automatic and there was no conscious effort to align the hood ornament with the center line to stay in the lane. That's the moment of epiphany in driving. The difference between contra and SCD is in the extras: SCD driving is a stick shift, and parallel parking is required. 

     I am a professional editor with twenty-six years of SCD experience, who started contra dancing twenty-four years ago. I wrote something like this for a beginners' class I taught about fifteen years ago. This is a good first draft and is well organized, but it needs corrections and it needs citations. I will do that as time permits, probably in sections. My first task will be to dig out all my references from a deep box piled with unorganized books and ghillies and tapes, so please be patient. Or maybe I'll just do a quick-and-dirty copyedit.

If mincemeat in your experience has been a sorry disappointment, as most meatless mincemeats are, try this extraordinary recipe.

==Ingredients==
===Spices:===
*2 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
*1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
*1.2 tsp ground cloves
*1 Tbsp dried coffee (regular or decaffeinated)
*1 tsp salt 
*1/2 tsp ground black pepper — added after cooking
*4 c sugar
*6-8 lbs. Baldwin apples
*1 whole lemon, remove only the seeds
*3 to 4 lbs. stew beef (neck, plate, etc.)
*2 c seedless black raisins

===Liquids===
*1 c meat stock ( 1 1/2 c if not using brandy)
*1 1/2c sorghum (health food stores often have it, but molasses is easier to find in the supermarkets)
*1 c cider vinegar
*1/2 to 3/4 c brandy (optional, but don’t risk ruination with cheap brandy)


==Procedure==
# Core apples; remove the seeds, but don’t peel. The suet can be removed before cooking and the fat skimmed off that renders from the meat as it cooks if desired.
# Cube meat and cover with salted water (salt optional). Simmer until tender - may take up to an hour. 
# Remove meat and cook the stock down to the amount needed, or thicken slightly with cornstarch.
# Put meat through food mill (medium or coarse blade) or equivalent fineness in a food processor. For texture, I definitely prefer the grinder over the processor.
# Cut lemon, remove seeds, and purée in a blender, rind and all, with some of the liquid ingredients, or process as finely as possible in a food processor.
# Grind the apples, (or process using a coarse blade—but not too fine).
# Mix into a large, heavy bottom, stew pot adding alternately apples, meat, raisins. 
# Add the sugar, spices, the liquids and the lemon purée to the to the meat and apples using hot meat stock to rinse the last of the sorghum into the mixture. Stir thoroughly.
# Cook slowly uncovered, stirring often to prevent burning until the mixture is pasteurized and enough of the liquids have evaporated to produce the texture and thickness you want in the finished pie. 
# Let cool.
# Stir in the ground pepper. 
# Refrigerate, allowing the spices to mellow for several weeks ...or until you can’t hold out any longer.

==Further thoughts==
The apples are the most important ingredient, without doubt. Insipid apples make lousy mincemeat. A sharp, crisp, flavor-laden “pie” apple is best—we are very partial to the late maturing Baldwins—but Cortlands are also good. (Granny Smiths are plenty crisp and tart, but fall short in flavor, we think.) 

If you can’t find Baldwins or Cortlands, use the best pie apple you can find. And at their peak of flavor and texture in the autumn.

In our home, late October or early November is mincemeat time—so the mincemeat will be ready for the Holiday season. Ready? Yes, mincemeat at its best needs a few weeks to season in the refrigerator, say 6-8 weeks. The spices and flavors continue to mellow and will be just right for Thanksgiving and the coming holidays.

Will it keep? You bet! After all, the Pennsylvania Dutch ancestors had no freezers or refrigerators. Look at the ingredients: spices, sugar, vinegar—a cool storm cellar was good enough, ‘specially if you made a heap of it and put it in one of those many-gallon, stoneware crocks to age. 

Anyway, by spring when the weather turned warm, the mincemeat would be gone. Those hungry midwestern farmer ancestors who passed this recipe down the generations wouldn’t have left a scrap to spoil.

After aging, make up mincemeat pies and tarts to freeze un-baked; they will keep for several months. Pop them straight from the freezer into a hot oven for easy baking. 

What else to do with mincemeat? 
*Use as a hot topping for rich, vanilla ice cream; 
*Fancy, lettuce &amp; cottage cheese salad with mincemeat topping  
*Or simply as cold topping for plain cottage cheese or yogurt (at Sunday brunch, perhaps)?
*Classy peanut-butter/mincemeat sandwiches
*Oatmeal cookies made with mincemeat and raisins
*A spicy mincemeat chutney!  Simple and quick: Just sauté 1/2 tsp. red pepper in a Tbsp. of butter for five minutes.  Stir into a cup of mincemeat and there's your sweet and hot chutney.
*Tart filling 
*On toast
*Our own secret sin is cold pie with a glass of even colder milk... for breakfast, of course! 

Let your imagination go.  There’s really no limit with mincemeat, don't you know!

==Discussion==

In 1880 when Bess Storm's mother, Anna Frances Lynch, packed her little, brown-paper covered trunk for the trip from Boston to Iowa, she slipped in a small applewood box. In the box she had put a few pieces of jewelry and a few of her favorite recipes, including this one for mincemeat that had been in her family for as long as anyone could remember. 

Anna said that her grandmother, a devout temperance worker, took out the brandy and substituted vinegar and coffee, a combination that gives this recipe a distinct taste of its own.

This recipe has been a favorite family tradition for well over 100 years. If there exists a better mincemeat, we have yet to find it. What makes it special? Maybe the brandy. Maybe the coffee. (Recent generations have substituted dried coffee to hold down the excess liquid and shorten cooking time.)

=== Elements of calculus ===
====A definite integral====
Imagine an object &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; that is free to move in one dimension — say, along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis. Like every physical object, it has a more or less fuzzy position (relative to whatever reference object we choose). For the purpose of describing its fuzzy position, quantum mechanics provides us with a probability density&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\rho(x).&lt;/math&gt; This depends on actual measurement outcomes, and it allows us to calculate the probability of finding the particle in any given interval of the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis, provided that an appropriate measurement is made. (Remember our mantra: the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics serves to assign probabilities to possible measurement outcomes on the basis of actual outcomes.)

&lt;br&gt;[[image:Probdist.png|500px]]

&lt;br&gt;We call &lt;math&gt;\rho(x)&lt;/math&gt; a probability ''density'' because it represents a probability per unit length. The probability of finding &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; in the interval between &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; is given by the area&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; between the graph of &lt;math&gt;\rho(x),&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis, and the vertical lines at &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_2,&lt;/math&gt; respectively.
How do we calculate this area? The trick is to cover it with narrow rectangles of width &lt;math&gt;\Delta x.&lt;/math&gt;

[[image:Probdist1.png|320px]]

&lt;br&gt;The area of the first rectangle from the left is &lt;math&gt;\rho(x_1+\Delta x)\,\Delta x,&lt;/math&gt; the area of the second is &lt;math&gt;\rho(x_1+2\,\Delta x)\,\Delta x,&lt;/math&gt; and the area of the last is &lt;math&gt;\rho(x_1+12\,\Delta x)\,\Delta x.&lt;/math&gt; For the sum of these areas we have the shorthand notation
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=1}^{12}\rho(x+k\,\Delta x)\,\Delta x.&lt;/math&gt;
It is not hard to visualize that if we increase the number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of rectangles and at the same time decrease the width &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; of each rectangle, then the sum of the areas of all rectangles fitting under the graph of &lt;math&gt;\rho(x)&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; gives us a better and better approximation to the area&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and thus to the probability of finding &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; in the interval between &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_2.&lt;/math&gt; As &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; tends toward&amp;nbsp;0 and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; tends toward infinity (&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;), the above sum tends toward the ''integral''
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\rho(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

We sometimes call this a ''definite'' integral to emphasize that it's just a number. (As you can guess, there are also ''indefinite'' integrals, about which more later.) The uppercase delta has turned into a&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; indicating that &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitely small (or ''infinitesimal'') width, and the summation symbol (the uppercase sigma) has turned into an elongated&amp;nbsp;S indicating that we are adding infinitely many infinitesimal areas.

Don't let the term &quot;infinitesimal&quot; scare you. An infinitesimal quantity means nothing by itself. It is the ''combination'' of the integration symbol &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\int&lt;/math&gt; with the infinitesimal quantity &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; that makes sense as a ''limit'', in which &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; grows above any number however large, &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; (and hence the area of each rectangle) shrinks below any (positive) number however small, while the sum of the areas tends toward a well-defined, finite number.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) technology is the server-side component architecture for Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE). EJB technology enables to create distributed, transactional, secure and portable application component objects.

EJB supports the development and deployment of component based business applications.  Applications written using the Enterprise JavaBeans architecture are scalable, transactional, and multi-user secure.  These applications may be written once, and then deployed on any server platform that supports the Enterprise JavaBeans specification.

== EJB History ==
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Todo|Complete this section.}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== EJB Features ==
* Security Management
* Persistance Management
* Transaction Management
* Distributable Interoperable Management
* Exception Management

== Types of EJB ==
* Session Beans
** StateFull Session Beans
** Stateless Session Beans
* Entity Beans
* Message Driven Beans

== Problems with EJB as a component based development ==
EJBs are an attempt to create component based application development.  With EJBs it is easier to develop components, but the same basic and fundamental maintenance problem will still be there. That is the dependencies between the client and the components.  The usage of a component is fixed, changes on the component interface cause to break the client code.  The same client/server problem comes back, that is as the users of a component increases the maintenance of that component getting harder and harder until it goes to impossible.

For a true component based application development we need to standardize the usage of a component.  The client must somehow flexibly figure out automatically how to use a component, so component changes don't affect any of the clients using that component. Without that flexibility, a true component based application development will remain as an idea, a dream, a theory without significant practical use.
If we had that flexibility, it could cause a paradigm shift in the software development industry.

[[Java Programming/JavaSpaces|JINI]] was an attempt from Sun to address this flexibility problem.  In JINI, the client download the component interface implementation and execute it in the client space.

So we need to mix (somehow) EJB and JINI technologies to come up with a true flexible component based technology.

== Naming policy ==

Hi - you will find that your recipes have been &quot;moved&quot; to Cookbook:Sweet rice etc in accordance with naming policy - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:15, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
:Hi Frank - hopefully you saw the answer that went on my talk page which is quite right.  The Cookbook is actually a book in its own right which is good news and all recipes are so named.  You should be able to get it by using the advance search and checking the Cookbook box (just worked for me).  Let me know if I can help, it can be confusing I know - we were all new to it once!

Wouldn't have thought of that - thanks - may well try it some time, regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:53, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for uploading [[:Image:LASRMECH.jpg]]. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

== Image copyright problem with Image:300px-Samfax.jpg ==

Thank you for uploading [[:Image:300px-Samfax.jpg]]. I assume that the source of the image is [[w:Image:Samfax.jpg]]. Please note that you must provide information on the image description page that answer these three questions:

* Who created the image?
* Who owns the copyright to the image?
* Where did this image come from?

''If'' the image is [[w:Image:Samfax.jpg]] from the English-language Wikipedia, then you must provide a hyperlink directly to that image, you must name the author of the image ([[w:User:Jonnyt]]), and you must name and tag the image with the license the copyright holder has released the image under (&amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}).

If you do not provide this information on the image description page, the image may soon be deleted. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The '''Privet Honeysuckle''' is a low-growing evergreen shrub or groundcover, useful for planting on banks or other areas due to its low maintenance needs.

==Description==
This is a low, spreading shrub with an arching habit and &quot;fishbone-like&quot; leaves and secondary branches. The leaves are small, simple, shiny dark green. The small white flowers are borne in the axils in pairs, and while they are not showy they do attract hummingbirds.

==Growing Conditions==
Does best in well-drained soils. May require some shelter in the colder part of the range.

==Cultivars==
*‘Moss Green’: Compact, low-growing.
*‘Royal Carpet’: Straight branches and purple fruit.

==Uses==
The arching habit makes it a good candidate for growing over walls or on steep banks. Layers readily and spreads fairly quickly. 

The branches are also useful for floral arrangements.

==Maintenance==
Very easy. Can outgrow its space, but easily reined in.

==Propagation==
[[../Layering/]] is the most common method.

==Pests and Diseases==
Problems are rare in the garden. Occasionally browsed by deer, but grows back readily. See [[../Lonicera/]] for a full discussion of pests and diseases affecting the genus.

'''''Rudbeckia''''' is one of at least four genera in the family Asteraceae whose members are commonly known as coneflowers; the others are ''[[../Echinacea/]]'', ''[[../Dracopis/]]'' and ''[[../Ratibida/]]''.

A large number of species have been proposed within ''Rudbeckia'', but most are now regarded as synonyms of the limited list given below.  Several of these currently accepted species have several accepted varieties.  Some of them (for example the Black-eyed Susan, ''R. hirta''), are popular garden flowers, distinguished for their long flowering times.  There are many cultivars of these species as well.

==Description==
They are herbaceous, mostly perennial plants (some annual or biennial) growing to 0.5-3 m tall, with simple or branched stems. The leaves are spirally arranged, entire to deeply lobed, 5-25 cm long. The flowers are produced in daisy-like inflorescences, with yellow or orange florets arranged in a prominent, cone-shaped head; &quot;cone-shaped&quot; because the ray florets tend to point out and down (are decumbent) as the flower head opens.

===Uses===
Many species are used in prairie restorations and for ornamental use. Used by domestic stock for forage.  An abundance of these plants on a rangeland indicates good health. 

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
Division or seed.

==Harvesting==


==Pests and diseases==
''Rudbeckia'' species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including [[w:Cabbage Moth]] and [[w:Dot Moth]].

'''''Rudbeckia fulgida''''', commonly known as '''Black-eyed Susan''' or '''Orange coneflower''', is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. 

In the garden, this plant spreads aggressively by both rhizomes and seed.

The ripe seed is a favorite food of finches in winter.

==Description==
Stems are hairy, ridged, and dark green. Leaves are dark green, sparsely but rouchly haired, simple, with sparsely serrate margins. 

Flowers are heads, with black disk florets and bright orange ray florets, borne singly on stems that extend above the foliage.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==

&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==
Controlling the spread is the most common issue. Dividing out from the edges can control the vegetative spread. Deadheading can control the seeding, but if growing to attract winter birds, the seeds need to be left on the plant.

==Propagation==
Easily propagated by division.

==Harvest==

&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and Diseases==

module Main where

main = do args &lt;- getArgs

== smthing ==

So far so good.  You may want to mention in the first couple paragraphs that whitespace and indentation are significant.  This tripped me up, making the first program with a &quot;do&quot; not run for me.   I didn't know what to look for.  Thanks -- Jason Felice

== function call ==

the exercises ask you to use read and show to do some simple arithmetic on the arguments. Unfortunately it isn't explained how to call functions or operators, which leads me to the following ungrammatical program:
&lt;pre&gt;
main = do args &lt;- getArgs
          putStrLn (show ((read args !! 0) + (read args !! 1)))
&lt;/pre&gt;
--[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 16:02, 21 May 2007 (UTC)

:For what it's worth, function application has the highest precedence of them all, so your &lt;code&gt;read args !! 0&lt;/code&gt; is being understood as &lt;code&gt;(read args) !! 0&lt;/code&gt; Feel free to update the [[Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours/Answers|solutions page]], of course, maybe pointing this out -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:01, 22 May 2007 (UTC)


Shouldnt it be &lt;pre&gt; [arg] &lt;- getArgs&lt;/pre&gt; to keep up with good practices? 
--[[User:Xpika|Xpika]] 06:55, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

== Broken link ==

The link in &quot;explained [evaluator1.html#show later]) that will bind variables&quot; is broken (I tried to fix it myself, but even wiki markup is too complicated for me :-( ).

== Need more exeplaination on function ==

I think this section should explain more about what is a function. 
And also explain a bit the syntax and the scope of the variable.
As it's said earlier it should be explain the precedence rule when function is apply.

== A small suggestion ==

&quot;Haskell is case-sensitive: module names are always capitalized, declarations always uncapitalized.&quot;

Perhaps this sentence should be modified to replace &quot;always&quot; with &quot;conventionally&quot; or &quot;must be&quot;, depending on whether this is something Haskell enforces or not.--[[User:Tigerthink|Tigerthink]] ([[User talk:Tigerthink|talk]]) 05:50, 29 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Mother-Son Dynamic in Chapter 2 */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==''Mother-Son Dynamic in Chapter 2''==  

This chapter is comprised of two stories. The first is when Jesus turns water into wine at a wedding and the second is when he becomes angry and overturns the tables of the moneychangers in the temple at Jerusalem. Both events are done in front of large crowds of people and used to establish the holy nature of Jesus. It is what solidified his disciple’s faith in him and in his abilities, and what made many people believe in him and his abilities.

Lay faithful and scholars alike have debated the language that Christ uses toward his mother, Mary, in the fourth verse of John chapter 2.  Some translations, such as the NIV, even go so far as to insert a 'dear' (not present in the Greek) in front of 'woman' to, shall we say, soften the blow.  However, only a surfaced interpretation of Jesus' remarks would render him as being &quot;un-Christ-like&quot; to a parent.  Jesus also used the same brusqueness when rejecting his brother's helpful suggestions regarding the advancement of his ministry (Smith 84).  In fact, Jesus uses this device primarily because of his drive to fulfill scripture.  In other words, &quot;his hour, or time, [had] not yet come&quot; (Smith 84).  From another point of view, this kind of language represents a way in which Christ communicates the mystic nature of his person - no one, including his own mother, will know or understand his reasoning for actions (or withholding actions, as in the case of the 'rebuke' at Cana) if he does not wish to clearly impart that knowledge Himself.  The use of this direct address to His mother shows her subordination to Him.  Jesus, even though he respects His mother, is God's son, and no human, including His own mother, has any authority over Him.

The fact that Mary took matters into her own hands shows that she may in fact have had some hand in the wedding.  The servants themselves paid full respect to her, also showing her influence at this event.  Jesus was concerned about fulfilling the scripture--waiting to unfold it in a proper way and wanted to fulfill it according to God's plan. This is the first miracle.  How then would Mary know that Jesus was able to do this?  She elicited his potentiality. Even though, Jesus was concerned about his Father's timing, Mary knew by faith that he would act.  Mary then told the servants to listen and follow whatever Jesus told them to do.  Jesus trusted her judgment and went ahead with the first miracle.  However, Jesus time had still not come, and the miracle was performed in a low profile manner.  First of all, there is no true report of when exactly the water was turned into wine.  The jars were filled with water (v. 7), and by the time the master had tasted the water, it had become wine.  This substance in the vessel may have changed when the water was poured in, when it was drawn from the jars, while the servants carried it to the master, or even as the master was tasting it.  Even more important is the fact that there is no account of this miracle being viewed by the public.  The only people who we know saw the miracle were the servants, thus showing Jesus as a servant of the people.

John is the only book where Jesus' mother is present at the beginning of his ministry and at his death.  Jesus' mother, even without an account of Jesus' birth, plays an important role in John(Smith,83).  Smith says that the exchange between Jesus and his mother shows a picture that is evident throughout John.  The people around Jesus, including his own family, do not understand his purpose on earth (Smith,83-84).  His mother's subordination to Jesus is shown not only in how Jesus addresses her at the wedding, but also in how she is addressed throughout John.  The Gospel refers to her as &quot;Jesus' mother&quot; throughout, rather than &quot;Mary&quot; as the Synoptic Gospels call her.

==''John 2:1-11 Commentary''==
The wedding at Cana is a story found only in John.  The &quot;miracle&quot; or sign of turning water into wine is suggested to be the first example of the &quot;greater things&quot; as described in John earlier.  A highly debated issue is the wine symbolism.  One questions whether this reference is a deliberate allusion.  &quot;Yet John is tantalizingly vague, in the sense that the Gospel usually does not drive such allusions home or make them explicit.&quot; (Smith 87).  Jesus' ability to perform this great feat shows his power. 
In ''John'' 2:1-11, Jesus does the first of several signs.  He turns water into wine at the wedding at Cana that reveals his glory and makes his disciples believe.  When he does this it is important to consider where the water was being held - in stone jars. [http://www.wegm.com/coins/frescoes/images/cana.jpg] The stone is thought to be symbolic of purity, because stone does not transfer impurities.[http://www.abu.nb.ca/Courses/NTIntro/LifeJ/Images/JarQum.gif] That is why they are used for  &quot;Jewish rites of purification which become important as things develop&quot; (Smith, 84).  Furthermore, even though &quot;Jesus is the new revelation that supersedes the old, he knows the salvation of the Jews (4:22)&quot;(Smith, 84-5). Therefore the purity of the stone is an important idea to consider. However there are certain issues within this passage that remain mysteries to historians and novice readers alike. It is unclear when Jesus exactly changed the water into wine. Some even theorize that Jesus is the bridegroom.

A seriously important development in the passage is Jesus' address of his mother in response to her reporting to him the absence of wine in verse 3. Jesus replies in verse 4 by saying &quot;My time has not yet come.&quot; as if doing anything now would be too much for the people to bear at the moment. Jesus is aware that he must not &quot;spoil&quot; anything but he still acts and proceeds to make the water wine. It appears as if Jesus knows that he must set the stage for what is to come, almost in a manner as if he believes the people are not yet prepared. 

The glory is evident in the kindness at the Cana wedding, as the prologue has prepared us to notice (1:14). In response to a modest request Jesus provides wine in abundance.  The Son of God's gracious generosity and glory are revealed in this sign. Also, there is no synoptic parallel to this sign.  In addition, we might call changing water into wine a miracle, but the author calls it a 'sign' because its primary purpose is to lead the reader to believe in Jesus as the 'true vine' (John 15). A grape vine draws water out of the soil and produces fruit. The Holy Spirit descended like a dove upon Jesus when he was baptized, and he in turn gives the living water of the Holy Spirit to all who ask (John 4, John 7:37-39) which produces spiritual fruit in our lives if we are willing to be his disciples. This spiritual truth is represented in a physical way in the turning of water into wine at the wedding.

==''John 2:12-25 Commentary''==

Important topics to discuss include:

* The placement of the account of the temple incident at this early point in Jesus' ministry, as a historical issue of the relationship between John and the Synoptics.

* The saying about the temple being destroyed and rebuilt, another point of contact between John, the Synoptics and Acts, and the Gospel of Thomas.

* The symbolism of Jesus' action: did it symbolize the cleansing of the Temple, its destruction, or something else?

In ''John'' 2:13-22 the cleansing of the Temple signifies the post-resurrection rebuilding of the temple by Jesus. In contrast with John, the synoptic gospels place the cleansing of the temple towards the end of their accounts of Jesus' life, in the context of his final visit to Jerusalem, as one of the events leading directly to his crucifixion shortly thereafter.  There are generally considered to be three different possible interpretations to reconcile these differences.  First, Jesus could have cleared the temple twice, once early in his ministry (as recorded in John) and once near his death (as recorded in the Synoptics).  Second, John's timeline could be correct, with the synoptic authors placing the clearing of the temple at the end because it is the only place in the narrative where Jesus is in Jerusalem.  Finally, the time line of the synoptics could be correct.  Supporting this final position is the idea that the order of events in John is frequently determined by theological reasons rather than chronological data (Smith, 1984).  In ''John'' 2:19, Jesus states &quot;destroy this temple and in 3 days I will raise it up&quot;.  This is symbolic of His resurrection. What appears to be the same saying is discussed at the trial of Jesus in Mark and Matthew, as well as being quoted by onlookers at the crucifixion.

Jesus' public ministry as recorded by John takes place almost entirely in Jerusalem; in contrast to the Synoptic Gospels which depict the bulk of Jesus' ministry in Capernaum. Furthermore, the Synoptics only describe one trip to Jerusalem, not three in the case of John. This may be a clue as to the reason for the timeline inconsistency in the act of clearing the temple. This also gives us a clue into the perspectives of the authors themselves. The order and timelines of events and teachings of Jesus do not seem to be an area of concern for the writers; but rather the message itself is the primary objective. 

Jesus' reasons for clearing the temple is an oft talked about aspect of this narrative.  It seems clear from reading the narrative that one of the main reasons for his anger was a feeling that people were exploiting the temple for their own monetary gain.  John explicitly mentions the selling of, &quot;cattle, sheep, and doves.&quot; (John 2:14) Later John says, &quot;He told those who were selling the doves, 'Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father's house a marketplace!'&quot; (John 2:16) From this passage it is obvious that Jesus took issue with the selling of animals in the temple.  What makes this curious is that animal sacrifice was an integral part of Jewish worship.  It was probably not the animal sacrifice that Jesus was upset about but rather the selling of the animals inside the temple, which could be seen as a desecration.  There is also a possibility of exploitation in the mold of a modern day monopoly.  

The act of clearing the temple was probably seen as a fulfillment of Prophecy by the first century Christians. During the act, the Synoptics include Jesus quoting Isaiah 56:7 and Jeremiah 7:11; but in John, his disciples only remember afterwards the scripture of Psalm 69:9 (v.17)(Smith 89). The fact that three different scriptures are given from different sources to explain the same event implies that the early Christians were searching for meaning and messianic reasons for Jesus' actions, and not completely aware of the messianic implications for Jesus’ clearing of the Temple when the event actually took place.

      <comment>Reverted edit of [[Special:Contributions/Robert Horning|Robert Horning]], changed back to last version by Withinfocus</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm stepping in here after discussing the issue with several others and due to the absence of the original arbitrator.

I have found Panic's responses here especially offensive and detrimental to the sense of community we have at Wikibooks. Extremely verbose digs follow almost every issue SBJohnny or other inidividuals have added to the complaints here. Defending one's self is everyone's right but I believe this has become a soapbox about issues well beyond what we're supposed to be covering in an arbitration hearing. The same ideas repeat over and over in Panic's responses, continually resonating his disrespect for other editors and the book he contributes in. This arbitration should not be about the philosophy of editing but about resolving editor disputes. I feel that SBJohnny acted rationally in trying to defuse the situation through blocking. It seems that everyone I have talked to about this matter agrees with me (besides Panic). Therefore these are the actions I will be taking shortly:

#Panic2k4 and all other aliases will be banned from the project for six months. I feel this is an adequate time period for the C++ book and offended editors to recover.
#SBJohnny and any other party will have no actions taken against them, for I believe they acted rationally against many, many malicious edits.

Panic will be blocked in approximately 24 hours' time. I am leaving this short window open so that any last responses may be delivered at my talk page, and at my talk page only.

::Panic was given a chance to challenge this block by writing down what he believes he has done wrong and can change. He rejected this solution and so I see no other way to continue the discussion of this issue directly and so I will ignore any further correspondence to it. I believe everything has been said and objections made, and we will thus design a better system to avoid all this in the future. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:11, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

The '''Arbitration Committee''' is a standing group of wikibookians who can impose binding decisions on disputes. The Arbitration Committee is invoked as the last step of the [[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution|wikibooks dispute resolution process]], and should only be treated as a last resort. 

== Extent of Power ==

The Arbitration Committee is able to intercede on inter-user disputes and behavioral problems among Wikibookians. The Arbitration Committee is neither qualified nor able to make binding decisions on matters of book content. For disputes in that area, the [[Wikibooks:Editorial board|editorial board]] should be used instead, however, in exceptional cases that could destroy an entire book, such as in a book on origin of species where creationists are locked in battle with evolutionary biologists or vice versa, the Arbitration Committee may order a binding review by the Editorial Board.

Depending on the dispute, the Arbitration has the authority to:
*Formally censure users 
*Set conditions for participation 
*Protect pages from being edited for prescribed lengths of time 
*Block users from editing, up to and including infinite blocks
*Remove admin tools from admins

These powers should never be used except in response to specific arbitration cases brought to the committee.

== Membership ==

The arbitration committee members may be selected by the community from the pool of active admins. Because the Arbitration Committee may be called upon to enact bans on users, or to protect pages, non-admins are not eligible to be members of the Committee.

There is no limit on the number of users who can be on the arbitration committee, and no finite term lengths for people who do serve on the board. All members can be elected or removed by community vote at any time. The number of votes necessary to elect an admin to the committee should be double the average number of votes used to elect an admin in the same time period. Once the necessary number of votes are received, the new member will be confirmed by the existing board members (if any).

No member of the committee may participate in an arbitration hearing in which they are a disputant.

== Current Arbitrations/Members ==

== Past Arbitrations/Members ==
For a list of current and past arbitration cases, and to submit a new case for review by the arbitration committee, see [[Wikibooks:Arbitration]].

== Arbitration Process ==

[[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution]] must be completed before arbitration commences.

The specific process and timeframe of the arbitration will be determined by the Arbitration committee. However, all arbitration hearings must adhere to the process in [[Wikibooks:Arbitration]], in particular they should:

#Allow all parties to make a statment concerning the events of the dispute and
#Result in a verdict in a timely manner.

It is up to the discretion of the committee as to whether there will be rebuttals, and whether or not to allow the parties in the dispute to participate in the sentencing.</text>

==SB Johnny==
Hi!

Is this a bot? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:06, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

:No, I just feel like one. I guess I could update the cat orders with a bot, but I'm also reading the articles and fixing the odd link / typo / etc. as I go. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 09:09, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

::OK :). Are you just doing the cookbook, or are you working further out? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:14, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

:::Just Cookbook. I was going to add something, but can't now remember what it was... no matter, there's a few things just that little bit better now :/ [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 09:16, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

::::OK. I was just curious. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:27, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

Really good to see someone helping with the alpha cats in cookbook.  The idea of a &quot;cookbook&quot; with everything under &quot;C&quot; cries out for attention. All the best --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:40, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
:Thanks for the welcome. Yes, C for Chicken isn't so bad, but C for Dosa, C for Pasta... :-) --[[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 22:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
::Certainly seems daft to me and the (boring) maintenance is appreciated! I do have a slight problem with - for example - Chicken Liver Pate - should it be C, L or P?  I guess the discussion ''should'' be on cookbook talk but vews are always worth hearing. Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:18, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
:::In a classic recipe collection, with no proper categorisation mechanism, it might be titled &quot;Paté, chicken liver&quot; and filed under P. However, Wiki tends to file under the article title, so &quot;Chicken liver paté&quot; should thus be filed under C. Additionally, it should be categorised in &quot;Paté recipes&quot; (or should that be Pâté recipes?) :)
:::Oh, and whilst boring, it's good work to do when brain-dead and trying to avoid real work for a bit. I also get to read a few recipes, fix some spelling and links, and take a break from thinking too hard about anything for a while. --[[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 08:46, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
::::I confess I see it almost the same way.  Tho I do hope to put an odd recipe in myself before too long.  See you around I'm sure --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:54, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:41, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== Reply to your message ==

&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Recipes_with_metric_units|Metric Recipes]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to a couple of pages I'm watching. Please note that this incorrectly orders them all under &quot;M&quot; in the category. Instead, to correctly order these pages, please use the following: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Recipes with metric units|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. &quot;

I'm aware of this now.  I noticed that many of the pages I'd changed were being listed under 'm'.  I'll try and sort them all out over the next few days.  Thanks for the message! [[User:Xania|Xania]] 22:57, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

:G'day Xania, please take care to wrap wiki code in &quot;&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;&quot; to prevent the code being interpreted by wiki. I just fixed your comment above, as it had placed this talk page in the &quot;Recipes with metric units&quot; category :-) --[[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 23:20, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

== Browsers ==
No idea what you are using but Firefox allows you to run some nice scripts that are relevant for editing and checking changes to pages (if you didn't know).  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:28, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
:OK did some research and assuming I'm not jumping to conclusions - you may well know about popups.  Depending on what you use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cacycle/wikEd] could be useful.  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:32, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
::G'day Herby, I use Firefox and have popups going on WP, but haven't gotten around to it here. I hadn't seen wikEd before - thanks, will check it out. I'm actually trying to not do much here at present as it distracts me from paid work, but you know how it is :) --[[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 21:00, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
:::No worries.  To me things just ain't right without popups on here too and some of the other toys are neat too.  Sorry about the work getting in the way.  Catch you around --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:05, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== In case you miss it! ==
Take a look at this maybe [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#BOTM_and_COTM.2C_december]], I'm sure you could help tho I realise that you may be busy which is fine - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:38, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

:G'day Herby, I'm note sure what &quot;help&quot; entails here. I agree with ditching BOTM/COTM, but beyond that, I'm not an admin here and have no wish to be. I have about enough time to do some slog work on Cookbook, contribute the odd recipe that I've been emailing to other people, and watch for Cookbook vandalism. If I get some extra time, I'll do a little work on some of the programming language books. Did you have something specific in mind? --[[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 22:09, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

::Nothing heavy - I guess I just see you as someone who is more widely interested than some authors - the fact you deal with vandalism indicates that.  There are a number of rather neglected areas - I was pointed towards the help pages for example - some of which are dire.  I guess I was looking at categorising people (I hate that &lt;g&gt;) as &quot;staff&quot; being interested in the project rather than a specific book. All the best --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:36, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:::G'day Herby, thanks for the offer, but I might stick to the little that I've been doing for now. If I did venture into the help pages, I might not make it out again for a while :) and that would hinder anything I can offer Cookbook or Wikipedia. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 09:19, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

== Capitalization/Abbreviation ==
Is this how I can communicate back with you?  Thank you for telling me about the pipe issue in the external links.  
Is there a consensus regarding the capitalizing in a recipe?  Should it be 2 Cups or 2 cups?
Is there a consensus regarding abbreviating in a recipe? Should it be 2 Tablespoons, 2 Tbsp or something else?
Maybe there is a page that address all this and please let me nkow if there is a different way to communicate with you?

Morning (well here).  OK - reaction rather than response - I saw a link go in and was going to delete it. Saw page had another link and spammers fave argument - &quot;well there is another one there anyway&quot;!

Response rather than reaction - I'll take a good look and get back to you - say 24 hours (But wikibooks hours &lt;g&gt;) - sometime tomorrow if I don't get to it today.

:I'd typed this out anyway! That is the first time I have placed a link to anything other than a charity or dmoz in over 6 months editing wikis!!! You do have a problem with WP (I understand more than you know but it is too long a story!).  Here - as there is no policy (sigh) - you could do it but there I've done it and it's on my watch list so I'll try and keep it clean too. You'll have to tell me more about it sometime

::G'day Herby. Late evening here (just waiting for a gluten-free sourdough to cool so that we can taste it before wrapping it up for tomorrow, before going to bed). 

::I understand the EL problem, but there are legitimate reasons for having some ELs - the problem is sorting them from the SPAM and spurious stuff. Thanks for the opportunity for now, at least. I did look at DMOZ before making the page, and it just wasn't up to the job.

::Regarding the cleanup work, I pitch in when I have a chance, but some of the recipes in here need ''so'' much work it's daunting. Besides, there's a few other recipes I have that I really want to put in, given a little time, and I also have a full watchlist on WP. However, I just ditched about a dozen email lists, so maybe I'll have a little more time for wiki again :) cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 12:55, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

:::No problem here - I am an &quot;ex spam fighter&quot; from WP who is still in recovery tho so if I fail at anything point it out to me please.  It wasn't cleanup work I was after (tho that is always good).  A little reluctantly maybe browse [[WB:RFA]] and see if there is anything that may &quot;interest&quot; you.  Hope the bread is good - our attempts are more modest but we make all our own (with a bread maker sadly - work gets in the way so much).

:All seemed reasonable, so have voted accordingly - you owe me nothing! Bread is OK - it's gluten-free, so not exactly my favourite, but it'll keep the wife happy for now. I used to bake bread in a bread maker, but not since I started making sourdough. Given that I'm too lazy to knead, it really doesn't take much extra time or effort anyway. I also cheat with the starter - I mix flour with water in equal quantities, then add a little kefir for the necessary bacteria and yeast, and it fairly rips away overnight. Must drag the bod off to bed now - ta ta! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 13:41, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

== Morning mate! ==

Well you know what I mean.  If you get a block of recipes that need recat'ing I can do them easily with the bot if you want to.  I'll close the Kefir VfD today too.  If I don't catch you - best for the New Year --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:29, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
: G'day mate, thanks on the kefir VfD. Once gone, I might look up a couple of good kombucha recipes and build a page for that (although I've never made the stuff myself). I actually prefer to recat manually, because I also catch some red links, spello's, bad grammar, and plan silly statements while I'm passing. It's a good way to become more familiar with the recipe base. Hope you have a good NYE - will be having a quiet one myself this year - and best wishes for 2007.

::G'day mate, I was tagging with speedy delete but was advised to tag with NowCommons instead (see above).

As you are around - looking about you seem to have your head screwed on roughly the right way round!  Could you give me an opinion on the Cookbook ones here [[:Category:Copyright violations]].

Based on past performance it is unlikely anyone else will deal with them in a rush so if you could let me know your opinion I'd appreciate it.

::This whole image deletion thing is getting really frustrating. First, there is no established infrastructure other than the policy, &quot;These images will be deleted.&quot; Rather vague, it seems. Furthermore, as you have been arguing, and as I have argued to a lesser degree, many of these images are not difficult to replace. If people would just take the time, we could save a lot of valuable imagery.
::The apparent issues aside, what do you think of creating a new template similar to tag the images with other than subst:nsd so that we can know which images have been dealt with (i.e. have been replaced and deprecated either by wiki or another file)?

:I have suspected the same, ''unless'' they are medical research images from a public institution and released under some license.

'''Salvage treatments for biochemical failure after definitive radiotherapy.'''

&lt;br&gt;
See also: [[Radiation_Oncology/Prostate/Advanced_disease#PSA-only recurrence|Advanced disease]] for PSA-only recurrence.

==Androgen ablation==
'''''Timing of Salvage HT:'''''
*'''ICORG 97-01''' (Irish Clinical Oncology Research Group) (1997-2001) -- early vs late salvage HT
**Secondary (retrospective) analysis of a randomized trial. ICORG 97-01 compared short (4 months) vs long (8 months) neoadjuvant HT before RT. RT following HRT, 70 Gy. See also: [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate/Hormones/Adjuvant ADT#Androgen suppression duration |Adjuvant ADT]] for trial details.
**Purpose: compare survival outcomes of early vs late salvage HT. Treatment of biochemical failure was not specified per protocol.
***Group 1 (early salvage): biochemical failure, started on HT with PSA &lt;= 10, no distant mets.  Group 2 (late salvage): BF, started on HT with PSA &gt; 10, no distant mets. Group 3 (late salvage with DM): distant mets. 
**'''2013''' PMID 22658512 -- &quot;Early salvage hormonal therapy for biochemical failure improved survival in prostate cancer patients after neoadjuvant hormonal therapy plus radiation therapy-a secondary analysis of irish clinical oncology research group 97-01.&quot; (Mydin AR, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2013 Jan 1;85(1):101-8.)
**Conclusion: overall survival was improved for pts with BF treated with early salvage HT.

*'''RTOG 85-31''' (1987-92)
**&quot;Non-bulky&quot; trial. Long term (indefinite) HT vs none. See also: [[Radiation_Oncology/Prostate/Hormones/Adjuvant_ADT#Adjuvant androgen deprivation|Adjuvant ADT]] for trial details.
**'''2010''' PMID 20356687 -- &quot;Timing of Salvage Hormonal Therapy in Prostate Cancer Patients With Unfavorable Prognosis Treated With Radiotherapy: A Secondary Analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 85-31.&quot; (Souhami L, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Mar 29. [Epub ahead of print])
***Subset analysis, relapsing patients in RT alone arm. Defined early salvage as initiated with PSA &lt;10 and late-salvage as &gt;10. Median F/U 11 and 13 years
***Outcome: Early salvage significantly improved OS (HR 1.5, SS), no difference in local failure or cancer-specific mortality
***Conclusion: Early introduction of salvage hormonal therapy improved OS but not CSS. Randomized trial is warranted


'''''Intermittent androgen ablation:'''''
*'''Canadian trial''' - phase II
**PMID 16783817, 2006 &amp;mdash; &quot;Final results of the Canadian prospective phase II trial of intermittent androgen suppression for men in biochemical recurrence after radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer: clinical parameters.&quot;  Bruchovsky N et al. Cancer. 2006 Jul 15;107(2):389-95.
**103 pts. Each cycle consisted of cyproterone acetate (CA) x 4 wks then Lupron plus CA for a total of 36 wks. 
**Median f/u 4.2 yrs. Time off treatment averaged 53% of total cycle time.

==Brachytherapy==
*'''U.Wisconsin, 2007''' (Review) PMID 17685384 -- &quot;Management of prostate cancer recurrences after radiation therapy-brachytherapy as a salvage option.&quot; (Allen GW, Cancer. 2007 Oct 1;110(7):1405-16.)
**Review. Summarizes treatment of 226 pts reported in literature, including 12 pts from this institution not previously reported.
**Wisconsin experience: 12 pts, treated with brachy (I or Pd) + 3 mo neoadjuvant AA. Median f/u of 45 months after implant.
**Conclusion: salvage brachytherapy success rates are likely similar to salvage with surgery or cryotherapy.

**40 pts. 
**pT3 or pN+ in 54% (more likely if PSA &gt; 10). 
**Mean 39 months f/u. 2 pts died from PCA, 5 developed DM; none had local recurrence.  5-yr PSA control 55%. (more likely if pre-surgery PSA &lt; 10). In pts with pathologically localized disease (minimal T3), 82% had PSA control.
**Toxicity: 15% rectal injury (colostomy - 2 pts). Persistent urinary incontinence 58% (corrected with artificial sphincter in 9 of 18). 
**Conclusion: salvage prostatectomy provides excellent control of recurrence cancer; best performed before PSA increases greater than 10-20.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==John chapter 3 ==

Key ideas and points worthy of discussion in this chapter include : 

* Spiritual rebirth from above.

* Nicodemus as a representative character 

* Baptism (if that is what the reference to 'water' is referring to)

* The idea that judgment has already occurred and is based entirely on one's response to Jesus. This theme reflects what is known as ''realized eschatology'', and (particularly as interpreted by existentialist exegeses such as Rudolf Bultmann [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Bultmann]) it has had a profound influence on Evangelical theology and preaching.


In ''John'' 3:1, Nicodemus is presented at the beginning of this chapter as a &quot;ruler of the Jews.&quot;, a Senator, a sage, a Doctor of the Law, teacher of teachers and a leader of the Sandhedrin The Supreme Court).  He came to Jesus at night and questioned Him, because he knows that Jesus does not perform these &quot;signs&quot; with out God. The time which Nicodemus chooses to meet with Jesus shows, along with his position as ruler of the Jews may be linked.  Jesus, not a popular man with Jewish leaders, was usually talked to with a negative view.  Nicodemus recognizes a more positive side to Jesus and His relationship to God.  Rather than approaching Jesus during the day, Nicodemus' timing may reflect a fear of association with Jesus and in his recognizing Jesus Himself as a teacher and ruler.  The word &quot;night&quot; has also been seen as symbolic referring to evil deeds or sin and as playing opposite to the word meaning pure or sinless, &quot;light.&quot;  With that said Nicodemus is seen as coming to the father at night (with sin). Jesus then proceeds to inform Nicodemus on the necessity of a new birth from above.  Jesus explains more fully that a man must be born of water 

(Water is a symbol for the Wisdom of God. Faith come first by hearing Yah's words of Wisdom. We are cleansed and birthed by the words) 

 Nicodemus would understand that water meant God's wisdom: 
The word of Yah on high is the fountain of wisdom. (Ecclesiasticus (from the Latin Vulgate) 1: 5) 
Wisdom is poured forth like water. (Enoch 48:1A)
A wise man's knowledge wells up in a flood, and his counsel, like a fountain of life. (Sirach 14:13)  
A person's words can be life-giving water; 
words of true wisdom are as refreshing as a bubbling brook. (Prov 18:4 )

In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, for sin and for impurity. (Zech 13:1)
With joy you shall draw water from the wells of salvation. (Is 12:3)


so Jesus spent more time explaining the part of the spirit. 
God is a spirit. He is the father of spirits (elohim sons and daughters).

Some are fallen (elohim -demons). Some are messengers to men (angels). One is called the angel of Yah's presence. Yah only dealt with men in the old testament via the angel of his presence  -also known as the angel of wisdom by whom Yah created all things. Once you hear the words of the Father if your heart repents and is cleansed by them your body becomes a vessel for the angel of Yah's presence to enter. It is this infilling that makes you spirit born.

Nicodemus was not getting it.

(The Greek word for wind and spirit are one and the same 'pneuma'). Here in John is the only place in the new Testament where it is  translated as wind and it muddies the water to do so. Jesus said:

That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the angel of his presence is spirit. Do not look so surprised Nicodemus. Father breathes and his breath carries his words and those who hear them and obey them, become spirit born. &quot;The Spirit (angelof Wisdom) flows where it wants, and you are hearing its voice right this minute; but you are unaware  from where the voice (Bat kol) comes or to where it returns.
Nicodemus was astonished and asked, “How can this be possible?”

'''Jesus' use of words with double meaning'''. 

Jesus uses three words that have a double meaning. ''anothen'', meaning “from above” and “again”, ''hypsoo'', meaning “lift up” and “exalt”, and ''pneuma'', meaning “wind” and “spirit”. It is imperative that the reader understand the nature of this conversation between Nicodemus and Jesus to be able to recognize the human ignorance embodied by Nicodemus that actually kept him from “seeing and believing”. Jesus knows exactly what he is doing and is making every effort to bring Nicodemus to a right understanding of who he is, who God is and how this new covenant relationship works. 

In talking about new birth, Jesus uses a word that surpasses the concept of being born of the flesh. The brilliant Nicodemus cannot get past the idea of entering his mothers womb to understand that Jesus is talking about a spiritual birth. In trying to explain this spiritual rebirth, Jesus talks about the Spirit. The word used here, as noted above, has a double meaning. The second meaning, “wind”, speaks directly to the mystery of what Jesus is offering. 

Jesus’ reply to Nicodemus’ question of “How can this be”, comes in the form of a self-designation. Obviously his reference to the Son of Man is a reference to himself, but even Jesus seems confident that Nicodemus doesn’t get it (v12).  Jesus then talks about the Son of Man being lifted up, referencing an OT story that Nicodemus knew forward and backward. While it doesn’t comment on whether or not Nicodemus understands this teaching, the implication is that he followed his previous pattern of not being able to transcend the physical, what he knew, to embrace the mystery of the spiritual.



''John'' 3:14 states, &quot;And just as Moses lifted up the serpent ( another mistranslation. Neither Jesus nor Moses would use satanic serpent symbols. The Hebrew for seraphim (angel creatures) is meant here). in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.&quot;  This is a reference to Numbers 21, when the people became impatient with God and Moses because they were in the wilderness for so long.  Yahweh sent poisonous serpents among the people and many died.  The people admitted they had been sinning, so Moses prayed for the people and the Lord told Moses if he put a seraph on a pole, everyone who looked at it would live.  Numbers 21:9 states, &quot;So Moses made a saraph of bronze, and put it on a pole; and whenever a serpent bit someone, that person would look at the seraph of bronze and live.&quot; This is why angel worship became a mjaor problem among the Jews. 

 John 3:14 can symbolize and be foreshadowing Jesus' crucifixion on a pole, as Jesus died on the cross in order to take away the power of death. One thing that differentiates the Numbers passage from the John passage is that John states people must believe in the Messiah in order to be saved. This is a very common concept in John, and it is arguably an idea seen more often in the New Testament than in the Old Testament. 
Yahshuah continues with Nicodemus:
Those who gaze upon my wisdom teaching, and unite with the words (devarim, Memra , logos, angel of wisdom) I speak, and obey them, will find this wisdom will heal them of their sins and give them the Spirit-birth that leads to immortality and the Father’s love.
As it is written in the Scroll of Wisdom:
For when the dire venom of beasts came upon them and they were dying from the bite of crooked serpents, your anger endured not to the end. But as a warning, for a short time they were terrorized, though they had a sign of salvation, to remind them of the precept of your law. For he who turned toward it was saved, not by what he saw, but by you, the savior of all… But not even the fangs of poisonous reptiles overcame your sons, for your mercy brought the antidote to heal them. For as a reminder of your injunctions, they were stung, and swiftly they were saved… For indeed, neither herb nor application cured them, but your all-healing  word.    (Wisdom 16: 5)  

We are cleansed and healed by Yah’s words of wisdom. Yahshuah was the vessel that contained Yah’s wisdom. All who are wise come to that vessel and drink the words that cleanse and heal those who obey them.


In ''John'' 3:15, eternal life is used for the first time and emphasizes zoe life in the world to come.

The Greek word for believe in Greek is Pistis. It takes six English words to translate it: Believe,unites with, love and obey.
 Whoever believes (unites with, loves, and obeys) the son, will have Zoe-life, but whoever disobeys the son, will reap a bitter harvest of vengeance.  

Chapter 3 contains two of the most popular verses in the entire Bible, ''John'' 3:16 &amp; 17, which summarize the significance of Jesus Christ and His purpose for the world. &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes (unites with, loves, and obeys)  Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through Him might be saved.&quot; 

 Verse 18 goes on to explain that those who hear the message of Jesus, understand it, and yet refuse to believe are already judged. This reiterates the lesson of verse 15: that one must believe (unite with, love, and obey)  the Messiah to be saved. Those people who have already been judged are the ones in verse 19 who love the darkness and flee from the light. They are afraid of what the light will expose. Those who are saved love and come to the light, and God knows that their actions are done in God's name.  Once again, the author returns to the dichotomy of light and darkness.  Verses 19 and 20 reiterate this separation by focusing on how those not in the light are in fact fleeing the light. 

 This Johanine theme revisits the prologue statement of the Word as Light and also fits well with much of the first chapter of the letter 1 John.  Outside of the works of John, this also lends itself well to Paul's views on life outside Christ and life &quot;in Christ&quot; (cf. Romans 1 and Romans 6).

In this chapter, Jesus explains how eternal life works to Nicodemus, who is one of the teachers to the Jewish people in Israel. The famous verse John 3:16 [for God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son, so that whomever will believe in him will not perish, but have eternal life] is found in this section. It is interesting that these words seem to be spoken by Jesus himself in a third person oration. 

''John'' 3:22-30 shows Jesus's disciples as baptizing individuals who came to them (Jesus never water baptized but until his resurrection allowed  his disciples to water baptize). 

 This is the first and (other than ''John'' 4:1-3) only reference to a baptizing ministry during Jesus' lifetime. Further, John points to an overlap of  ministries of Jesus and John the Baptist. During the overlap a dispute arises that will lead John the Baptist to recap his testimony that His ministry points to Jesus. It does not compete with Jesus. Verse 24 notes that John the Baptist had not yet been imprisoned. The Synoptics imply that Jesus did not begin his ministry until John's imprisonment. In verse 27 John the Baptist acknowledges that his ministry is not his own. It has been a gift from God. This refers back to the first chapter of John, where John the Baptist tells of the one who comes after him. John the Baptist uses this opportunity to make it quite clear that he is in fact subordinate to Jesus. Verse 28 repeats the statement by John from 1:20 that he was not the Messiah. Verse 29 introduces a very important title for Jesus and John the Baptist. 

Jesus is a bridegroom and he has the bride (the new completed Torah).  John the Baptist is the friend of the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom was a mediator for the groom making necessary arrangements. John was essentially Jesus' best man. There is a question of which parts of this text are direct quotations of John the Baptist and which are commentary by the author. Although many Bible translations show that John the Baptist speaks from verse 27 through the end of the chapter, it is also argued that John the Baptist's quotation ends at verse 30, leaving the rest of the chapter as commentary. In verse 34, we read that &quot;He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.&quot; While the interpretation of Jesus the Messiah giving Spirit without measure fits better with the overall book, the author could be implying that God gives Jesus the Spirit without measure. The first two verses of chapter 4 return to the competition between Jesus and John the Baptist. These verses bring to a close the section that began in 3:22. Verse 3 then provides the transition verse to Jesus' encounter with the Samaritan woman described in chapter 4 (Hahn).

''John'' 3:36 lends itself to some very interesting and different interpretations.  It states, &quot;Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever disobeys the Son will not see life, but must endure God's wrath.&quot;  One interpretation of this can be that there is a contrast between eternal life and eternal punishment.  While this interpretation can make complete sense, especially considering &quot;God's wrath&quot; is spoken of, the idea of eternal life vs. eternal damnation (possibly hell) should not be simply implied without looking deeper into the text, especially its relationship with the rest of the Gospel.  Another interpretation of this verse is that the phrase, &quot;whoever disobeys the Son will not see life&quot; is referring to a more present tense.  To back this up, one can go back to earlier in Chapter 3, (3:18) when the present tense is spoken of again, in terms of judgment: &quot;Those who believe in him are not condemned: but those who do not believe are condemned already...&quot;  Since judgment doesn't just happen later on, but every day, the idea that those who disobey the Son won't see life can be thought of in a present tense: those who disobey won't live their lives every day the way they are supposed to.  Possibly, there is a sense that those who disobey the Son will live unfulfilled lives, and won't truly connect with God on a daily basis.  


'''Nicodemus and his relationship with Christ'''  Nicodemus was one of the Sanhedrin (from the Greek ''synedrion''), which was a kind of council or judiciary body for the Jewish people during the time of Christ. Nicodemus was described as 'the teacher of Israel' which certainly implies that he had some standing among the rabbis of his day.  He enjoyed considerable wealth, a high-ranking position, and significant influence over his fellows.  This is precisely why he should have been opposed to Christ - remember the pride, fear, and intolerance frequently evidenced by the Pharisees?  But Nicodemus, even though Christ's 'Baptism of the spirit' was a concept very foreign to him, still acknowledges that Christ could not perform his miracles without divine aid (Verse 2).  A unique occurrence indeed! Why would a man of Nicodemus' standing, 'the teacher of Israel' have a hard time comprehending Jesus' teaching? As Jesus states being born 'from above' and in(3:4) the repetition of a natural birth to Nicodemus was out of the question. By natural birth people become members of an earthly family; and to become members of the family of God, a birth 'from above' is necessary (Bruce). The author of John portrays Nicodemus as being a &quot;believer&quot; in Jesus for the duration of his ministry until his death. In John 19:39, Nicodemus helps Joseph of Arimathea in burying Jesus and even brought seventy-five pounds of &quot;myrrh and aloes&quot;.

'''Nicodemus as a representative character'''. 
The Gospel of John is not written to simply provide numerous examples of beautiful, poignant conversion experiences in all of it’s key characters. Throughout the narrative we hear very clearly that “not everyone believed”. “Everyone” includes people like Nicodemus. It seems the example of the character of Nicodemus highlights a very well-known lifestyle still being lived out in and around the Johannine community. Not to add an “example” to learn from, but to represent accurately the reality of believing in and following the person of Jesus. 

To come to the end of this story and conclude that Nicodemus was a true believer in every sense of the word is disastrous to the message. Christ then becomes a good teacher, who is from God; a title that no doubt was personally adopted by many pharisees. Belief is more about simply picking and choosing and being in control of what is true.

In similar fashion to the first disciples, Nicodemus was holding onto what he had found. A stunt that would be detrimental to his ability to see and understand who Jesus was and what he must do to truly believe. Jesus simply wanted Nicodemus to let go of his preconceived ideas so he could receive this fresh outpouring of God. The character of Nicodemus can represent more than “pharisees”. We carry our preconceived ideas to God’s fresh outpouring all the time. 
While Nicodemus “misses” it and Jesus speaks of judgment, I think to interpret this passage in a way that brings about “7 steps to judging an un-believer” is wrong. Refusal to accept Jesus as the Son of God brings about a self-imposed condemnation, not a judgment or condemnation of God or of Jesus. Some scholars argue that Nicodemus exhibited a partial faith. Where does partial faith get us? According to this story within the larger narrative, it seems that we wind up with a cheap knock-off version of a true saving knowledge of Jesus.

How do we create boxes for God that cause us to miss God’s “new” and “fresh” grace “from above”? The inclusion of the Nicodemus story seems to be an intentional move by the evangelist to not only communicate the truth behind the message of Jesus, but to remind those a part of the Johannine community of what it means to truly follow Jesus. 



'''Nicodemus as symbolism'''  We know now that Nicodemus is a very distinguished teacher at the time
of Jesus and his own mission to teach. It has been said in the commentary by D. Moody Smith that although Nicodemus is &quot;a teacher of Israel, (he) is not yet in a position to converse with Jesus, because he has not attained knowledge of who Jesus really is.  Jesus cannot be understood by old standards.....&quot;(101).  This new knowledge seems to bring about again the idea that in order for all things to go accordingly, Jesus must be the new that replaces the old.  In this scenario Nicodemus is playing the role of old standards and teachings that must be redone and renewed.  In order for Jesus to take his rightful place, Nicodemus' way of thinking must change.  If he is a symbol of the old teachings of Judaism, then maybe what this passage in John is saying is that the Jewish teachings, which once used to be valid, are not so valid anymore, with respect to Jesus and the new replacing the old. In addition to the above symbolism embodied by Nicodemus, he quite possibly embodies those who are interested in Jesus' teachings today. Many people educate themselves in a quest to attain as much knowledge as possible but yet still cannot comprehend the teachings and principles that Jesus teaches and represents. Even to the smartest of people, Jesus can still be an enigma.

The symbolism continues through the reference to Nicodemus coming to Jesus &quot;by night&quot;.  Light and dark have been interpreted to symbolize both good and evil as well as the idea of new and old.  The fact that Nicodemus comes to Jesus furthers the interpretation that Nicodemus is not yet in position to converse with Jesus.  D. Moody Smith says this is because he has not attained knowledge of who Jesus really is yet.  Furthering the symbolism, Smith continues, &quot; Jesus cannot be understood by old standards, even those of the traditional Judaism represented by Nicodemus.  He is God's new and final revelation to Israel.&quot;(Smith 101)


'''John the Baptist Vs. Jesus '''  In the second part of chapter three the reader is introduced to a dialogue between John the Baptist and his own disciples, regarding himself and Jesus, and who has the right to baptize followers.  Although John's disciples believe in him, he says that he was put here to bear witness to Jesus, he has been sent in advance of Jesus.  He further tells them that Jesus is the one that comes from above and is over all others.  Jesus has been sent from God and &quot;must go on increasing, while I must go on decreasing&quot; (John 3:30).  His disciples must realize and accept this fact.

Chapter 3 of John explains the main belief of the Christian faith.  This chapter details how Jesus came into the world so that mankind would know the nature and character of God.  It also refutes many of the long-held beliefs the Jews had had about God being an angry punishing God.  They believed God punished people for all sorts of sins without there being a loving side to God.  Jesus' speech to Nicodemus shows that God is a loving God.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Main Rules ==

If you're just learning Improv, '''''This below are some rules copied from 'the main rules of improvisation in theater', take a look and realize, this works for the creation of improvised music too. just rhetorically speaking.''''' here are the main rules that you should be concerned about.


== Yes, and... ==

Often considered the main rule of Improv, all it says is that you are not allowed to accuse anything that anybody else said is false. Instead, add on to it.. For example, here is an example of a scene where &quot;Yes, and...&quot; is not used:

SUGGESTION: tournament

1: Alright, are you ready to tee off? 
2: What are you talking about? We're not on a golf course, we're at a basketball court! 
The scene is instantly killed, because there's nowhere for player 1 to go with the scene. Here's an example of &quot;Yes, and...&quot; used correctly:

1: Alright, are you ready to tee off? 
2: Yeah, but I'm pretty nervous. It's the last hole, and I'm ahead by 2 strokes. 
Player 2 has now added on to the scene, and developed a problem and a place for the scene to go.



== Don't Try To Be Funny ==

Very important, especially for beginning improvisers. Don't try to be funny. Humor will come naturally out of the scene without any effort. Just try to act out the scene, and the game or elements will add humor. For example, which of these is funnier:

SUGGESTION: cheerleader and car

1: Aw man, my car ran out of gas, and I'm all out of money. 
2: I'll give you a dollar if you make me laugh. 
1: Poop. 
Both players 1 and 2 tried to be &quot;funny&quot;, and ended up making a stupid scene. Instead, look at the following scene, where people just act the scene out naturally.

1: Aw man, my car ran out of gas, and I'm all out of money. I guess I'll have to dance for money at this bar. 
2: What are you doing? 
1: Alright? Ready? Okay! {does cheerleading routine} 
2: What is going on? 
1: Alright! Anybody? Tips? Anybody? 
The scene is funny because it's a situation that we don't normally see, and not because everybody was trying to be funny.


== Playing Off Lines ==

Don't go into a scene with a set agenda. Instead, listen to what other people say, and base your next line off of that. Here's an example where people have gone into the scene with set agendas:

SUGGESTION: spies

1: Alright, the Queen's given us her directions. Let's go. 
2: Let's go get the diamond! 
1: Uh oh, we need to go through a pit of snakes! 
It is almost like two scenes are going on at the same time, with neither person listening to each other. Here's an example of &quot;Playing Off Lines&quot; used correctly:

1: Alright, the Queen's given us her directions. Let's go. 
2: I just need to know why the Queen needs this diamond. 
1: I don't think that it's important, it's just that she wants to mount it on her ring. 
Now that the two actors are listening to each other, the scene takes shape, and humor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several variants of regular expressions. These variants differ not only in their concrete syntax but also in their capabilities. Individual tools that support regular expressions also have their own peculiarities.

* [[../Simple Regular Expressions/]] - widely used for backwards compatibility, but deprecated on POSIX compliant systems.
* [[../Basic Regular Expressions/]] - used by some Unix shell tools
* [[../Perl Compatible Regular Expressions/]] - used by Perl and some application programs
* [[../POSIX Basic Regular Expressions/]] - provides extensions for consistency between utility programs. These extensions are not supported by some traditional implementations of Unix tools.
* [[../POSIX Extended Regular Expressions/]] - may be supported by some Unix utilities via the -E command line switch
* [[../Non-POSIX Basic Regular Expressions/]] - provides additional character classes not supported by POSIX
* [[../Emacs Regular Expressions/]] - used by the emacs editor
* [[../Shell Regular Expressions/]] - a limited form of regular expression used for pattern matching and filename substitution

===Greedy expressions===
Quantifiers such as * and + match as much as they can: they are greedy. For some uses, their greediness does not fit. For example, let as assume you want to find the first string enclosed in quotation marks, in the following text:

: These words include &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;mat&quot;, and &quot;pat&quot;.

The pattern &lt;code&gt;&quot;.*&quot;&lt;/code&gt; matches the italicized part of the text below, that is, ''&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;mat&quot;, and &quot;pat&quot;'' instead of the desired ''&quot;cat&quot;'':
: These words include ''&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;mat&quot;, and &quot;pat&quot;''.

To fix this, some flavours of regular expressions provide non-greedy operators such as *?, +?, and }?. In PHP, adding a &quot;U&quot; at the end of the regexp makes the quantifier non-greedy, as in &lt;code&gt;/&quot;.*&quot;/U&lt;/code&gt;. In flavours that support neither of the two options, you can specify what is ''not'' to be matched, as in &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;(&quot;[^&quot;]*&quot;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to fix the discussed example. However, when dealing with bracketed expressions, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;(\[\[[^\]]*\]\])&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; fails to match on ''A B C [[D E] F G]]''.

===Comparison table===
A comparison table or matrix that shows which features or flavors of regular expressions are available in which tool or programming language is available from [http://www.regular-expressions.info/refflavors.html regular-expressions.info].

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Differential calculus: a very brief introduction====
Another method by which we can obtain a well-defined, finite number from infinitesimal quantities is to divide one such quantity by another.

We shall assume throughout that we are dealing with well-behaved functions, which means that you can plot the graph of such a function without lifting up your pencil, and you can do the same with each of the function's derivatives. So what is a function, and what is the derivative of a function?

A ''function'' &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a machine with an input and an output. Insert a number&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and out pops the number&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x).&lt;/math&gt; Rather confusingly, we sometimes think of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; not as a machine that churns out numbers but as the number churned out when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is inserted.

&lt;br&gt;[[image:Derivative1.png|720px]]

&lt;br&gt;The (first) ''derivative'' &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a function that tells us how much &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; increases as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; increases (starting from a given value of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x,&lt;/math&gt; say&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;) in the limit in which both the increase &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding increase &lt;math&gt;\Delta f =f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; (which of course may be negative) tend toward&amp;nbsp;0:

:&lt;math&gt;
f'(x_0)=\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow0}{\Delta f\over\Delta x}={df\over dx}(x_0).&lt;/math&gt;

The above diagrams illustrate this limit. The ratio &lt;math&gt;\Delta f/\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the ''slope'' of the straight line through the black circles (that is, the &lt;math&gt;\tan&lt;/math&gt; of the angle between the positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis and the straight line, measured counterclockwise from the positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis). As &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; decreases, the black circle at &lt;math&gt;x+\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; slides along the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; towards the black circle at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x,&lt;/math&gt; and the slope of the straight line through the circles increases. In the limit &lt;math&gt;\Delta x\rightarrow 0,&lt;/math&gt; the straight line becomes a tangent on the graph of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x),&lt;/math&gt; touching it at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; The slope of the tangent on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is what we mean by ''the slope of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_0.&lt;/math&gt;

So the first derivative &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the function that equals the slope of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for every&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; To ''differentiate'' a function&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is to obtain its first derivative&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f'.&lt;/math&gt; By differentiating &lt;math&gt;f',&lt;/math&gt; we obtain the second derivative &lt;math&gt;f''=\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f,&lt;/math&gt; by differentiating &lt;math&gt;f''&lt;/math&gt; we obtain the third derivative &lt;math&gt;f'''=\frac{d^3f}{dx^3},&lt;/math&gt; and so on.

It is readily shown that if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a number and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are functions of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x,&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;
{d(af)\over dx}=a{df\over dx}&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;  &lt;math&gt;{d(f+g)\over dx}={df\over dx}+{dg\over dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

A slightly more difficult problem is to differentiate the product &lt;math&gt;e=fg&lt;/math&gt; of two functions of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; Think of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; as the vertical and horizontal sides of a rectangle of area&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;e.&lt;/math&gt; As &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; increases by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x,&lt;/math&gt; the product &lt;math&gt;fg&lt;/math&gt; increases by the sum of the areas of the three white rectangles in this diagram:

&lt;br&gt;[[image:Product.png]]

&lt;br&gt;In other &quot;words&quot;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta e = f(\Delta g)+(\Delta f)g+(\Delta f)(\Delta g)&lt;/math&gt;

and thus

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Delta e}{\Delta x} = f\,\frac{\Delta g}{\Delta x}+\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}\,g+ \frac{\Delta f\,\Delta g}{\Delta x}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we now take the limit in which &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and, hence, &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt; tend toward&amp;nbsp;0, the first two terms on the right-hand side tend toward &lt;math&gt;fg'+f'g.&lt;/math&gt; What about the third term? Because it is the product of an expression (either &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt;) that tends toward&amp;nbsp;0 and an expression (either &lt;math&gt;\Delta g/\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Delta f/\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;) that tends toward a finite number, it tends toward&amp;nbsp;0. The bottom line:

:&lt;math&gt;
e' = (fg)' = fg' + f'g.&lt;/math&gt;

This is readily generalized to products of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; functions. Here is a special case:

:&lt;math&gt;
(f^n)'=f^{n-1}\,f'+f^{n-2}\,f'\,f+f^{n-3}\,f'\,f^2+\cdots+f'\,f^{n-1}=n\,f^{n-1}f'.&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equal terms between the two equal signs. If the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; returns whatever you insert, this boils down to

:&lt;math&gt;
(x^n)'=n\,x^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a function of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; An increase in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; causes an increase in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\Delta f\approx\frac{df}{dx}\Delta x,&lt;/math&gt; and this in turn causes an increase in &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\Delta g\approx\frac{dg}{df}\Delta f.&lt;/math&gt; Thus &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta g}{\Delta x}\approx\frac{dg}{df}\frac{df}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt; In the limit &lt;math&gt;\Delta x\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; becomes a &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; :

:&lt;math&gt;
{dg\over dx}={dg\over df}{df\over dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

----

&lt;br&gt;We obtained &lt;math&gt;(x^n)'=n\,x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; for integers&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n\geq2.&lt;/math&gt; Obviously it also holds for &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n=1.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
# Show that it also holds for negative integers&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n.&lt;/math&gt; Hint: Use the product rule to calculate &lt;math&gt;(x^nx^{-n})'.&lt;/math&gt;
# Show that &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt x)'=1/(2\sqrt x).&lt;/math&gt; Hint: Use the product rule to calculate &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt x\sqrt x)'.&lt;/math&gt;
# Show that &lt;math&gt;(x^n)'=n\,x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; also holds for &lt;math&gt;n=1/m&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number.
# Show that this equation also holds if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a rational number. Use &lt;math&gt;{dg\over dx}={dg\over df}{df\over dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since every real number is the limit of a sequence of rational numbers, we may now confidently proceed on the assumption that &lt;math&gt;(x^n)'=n\,x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; holds for all real numbers&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n.&lt;/math&gt;

===Introduction===

You may have noticed something possibly peculiar about all of the problems so far dealt with: &quot;simple&quot; numbers like &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; keep appearing in BCs and elsewhere. For example, we've so far dealt with BCs such as:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Is this meant to simplify this book because the author is lazy? No. Well, actually, the author ''is'' lazy, but it's really the result of what's known as '''nondimensionalization'''.

On a basic level, nondimensionalization does two things:

:*Gets all units out of the problem.
:*Makes relevant variables range from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; or so.

The second point has very serious implications which will have to wait for later. We'll talk about getting units out of the problem for now: important because most natural functions don't have any meaning when fed a unit. For example, &lt;math&gt;\sin(2.0 s)&lt;/math&gt; is a goofy expression which doesn't mean anything at all (consider its Taylor expansion if you're not convinced).

Do not misunderstand: you can solve any problem you like keeping units in place. That's why angular velocity has units of Hz (&lt;math&gt;s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;), so then &lt;math&gt;\sin(2.0 Hz t)&lt;/math&gt; has meaning if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is in seconds (or can be made to be).

A motivation for nondimensionalization can be seen by noting that ratios of variables to dimensions (&quot;dimension&quot; includes both a size and a unit) have a tendency to show up again and again. Examine what happens if steady state parallel plate flow (an ODE) with the walls separated by &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, '''not &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;''', is solved:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = \frac{P_x}{\nu \rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(D) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Let's keep the dimensions of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; unspecified for now. Solving this BVP:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = \frac{P_x}{\nu \rho} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad u = \frac{P_x}{2 \nu \rho}y^2 + C_1 y + C_0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0) = 0 = \frac{P_x}{2 \nu \rho} \cdot 0^2 + C_1 \cdot 0 + C_0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad C_0 = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(D) = 0 = \frac{P_x}{2 \nu \rho} D^2 + C_1 D \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad C_1 = -\frac{P_x}{2 \nu \rho} D\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y) = \frac{P_x}{2 \nu \rho} (y^2 - D y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y) = \frac{D^2 P_x}{2 \nu \rho} \left(\left(\frac{y}{D}\right)^2 - \frac{y}{D}\right)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that we have &lt;math&gt;y/D&lt;/math&gt; showing up. Not a coincidence; this implies that the dimensionless problem (or at least halfway dimensionless. We haven't discussed the dimensions of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;) could be setup by altering the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; variable:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat y = \frac{y}{D}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\hat y&lt;/math&gt; is the normalized version of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, it ranges from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; varies from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. It is said that '''&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is scaled by &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;'''.

This new variable may be substituted into the problem:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(\hat y) = \frac{D^2 P_x}{2 \nu \rho} (\hat y^2 - \hat y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the new variable contains no unit, it should be obvious that the rational coefficient '''must''' have units of velocity if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is to have units of velocity. With this in mind, the coefficient may be divided:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{u(\hat y)}{\cfrac{D^2 P_x}{2 \nu \rho}} = \hat y^2 - \hat y\,
&lt;/math&gt;

We may define another new variable, a nondimensional velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat u = \frac{u(\hat y)}{\cfrac{D^2 P_x}{2 \nu \rho}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat u(\hat y) = \hat y^2 - \hat y\,
&lt;/math&gt;

It's finally time to ask an important question: '''Why?'''

There are many benefits. The original problem involved 4 parameters: viscosity, density, pressure gradient, and wall separation distance. In this fully nondimensionalized solution, there happens to be none such parameters. The shortened equation above completely describes the behavior of the solution, it contains all of the relevant information.

The solution of one nondimensional problem is ''far'' more useful then the solution of a specific dimensional problem. This is especially true if the problem only yields a numeric solution: solving the nondimensional problem greatly reduces the number of charts and graphs that need to be made since you've reduced the number of parameters that could affect the solution.

This leads to another important question, and the culmination of this chapter: here, we first solved a generic dimensional problem and then nondimensionalized it. This luxury wouldn't be available with a more complicated problem. Could it have been nondimensionalized beforehand? Yep. Recalling the BVP:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = \frac{P_x}{\nu \rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(D) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; varies from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; in the domain we're interested in. For this reason, it is '''natural''' to ''scale'' &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat y = \frac{y}{D}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that we could have just as well scaled &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with numbers like &lt;math&gt;\pi D&lt;/math&gt; or ''e''&lt;sup&gt;10.0687&lt;/sup&gt; D and still ended up with &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; nondimensionalized and everything mathematically sound. However, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; '''alone''' was the best choice since the resulting variable &lt;math&gt;\hat y&lt;/math&gt; would vary from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. With this choice of scale, the variable is called '''normalized''' in addition to being nondimensional; being normalized is a desirable attribute for mathematic simplicity, accurate numeric evaluation, sense of scale, and other reasons.

What about &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;? The character of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; was known, the same can't be said for &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; (why are we solving problems in the first place?). Let's come up with a name for the unknown scale of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, say &lt;math&gt;u_s&lt;/math&gt;, and normalize &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; using this unknown constant:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat u = \frac{u}{u_s} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad u = u_s \hat u\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the chain rule, the new variables may be put into the ODE:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d u}{d y} = \frac{d}{d y}(u) = \frac{d}{d y}(u_s \hat u) = u_s \frac{d \hat u}{d y} = 
u_s \frac{d \hat u}{d \hat y} \cdot \frac{d \hat y}{d y} = 
u_s \frac{d \hat u}{d \hat y} \cdot \frac{d}{d y}\left(\frac{y}{D}\right) = \frac{u_s}{D} \frac{d \hat u}{d \hat y}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = \frac{d}{d y}\left(\frac{d u}{d y}\right) = 
\frac{d}{d y}\left(\frac{u_s}{D} \frac{d \hat u}{d \hat y}\right) = 
\frac{u_s}{D} \frac{d}{d y}\left(\frac{d \hat u}{d \hat y}\right) = 
\frac{u_s}{D} \frac{d}{d \hat y}\left(\frac{d \hat u}{d \hat y}\right) \cdot \frac{d \hat y}{d y} = 
\frac{u_s}{D} \frac{d^2 \hat u}{d \hat y^2} \cdot \frac{d}{d y}\left(\frac{y}{D}\right) = 
\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = \frac{u_s}{D^2} \frac{d^2 \hat u}{d \hat y^2}
\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = \frac{u_s}{D^2} \frac{d^2 \hat u}{d \hat y^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

So we have our derivative now. It may be substituted into the ODE:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = \frac{P_x}{\nu \rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{u_s}{D^2} \frac{d^2 \hat u}{d \hat y^2} = \frac{P_x}{\nu \rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u_s \frac{d^2 \hat u}{d \hat y^2} = \frac{D^2 P_x}{\nu \rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Remember that &lt;math&gt;u_s&lt;/math&gt; was some constant pulled out of thin air. Hence, it can be anything we want it to be. To nondimensionalize the equation and simplify it as much as possible, we may pick:

:&lt;math&gt;
u_s = \frac{D^2 P_x}{\nu \rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

So that the ODE will become:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2 \hat u}{d \hat y^2} = 1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The BCs are homogeneous, so they simplify easily. Noting that &lt;math&gt;\hat y = 1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;y = D&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat u(0) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat u(1) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This may now be quickly solved:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2 \hat u}{d \hat y^2} = 1 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \hat u = \frac{\hat y^2}{2} + C_1 \hat y + C_0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat u(0) = 0 = \frac{0^2}{2} + C_1 \cdot 0 + C_0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad C_0 = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat u(1) = 0 = \frac{1^2}{2} + C_1 \cdot 1 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad C_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat u(\hat y) = \frac{1}{2}(\hat y^2 - \hat y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

So this isn't quite the same as the nondimensional solution developed from the dimensional solution: there's a factor of &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; on the right side. Consequently, &lt;math&gt;u_s&lt;/math&gt; is missing the &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;. It's not a problem, both developments solve the problem and nondimensionalize it. Note that in doing this, we got the following result before even solving the BVP:

:&lt;math&gt;
u_s = \frac{D^2 P_x}{\nu \rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This tells much about the size of the velocity.

Before closing this chapter, it's worth mentioning that, generally, if &lt;math&gt;\hat u = u u_s + C_u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat y = y y_s + C_y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u_s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C_y&lt;/math&gt; are all constants,

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^n u}{\partial y^n} = \frac{\partial^n \hat u}{\partial \hat y^n} \cdot \frac{u_s}{y_s^n}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Leibniz notation is definitely a good thing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm sorry, but what this person has posted is so indescribably irresponsible-- can any kind of note be added to reflect my informed opinion about it? This comment, especially, made me furious: &quot;This drug is awesome if you need an extra push to get ahead.&quot; Or maybe &quot;just when I really need that extra boost&quot; is even worse, if possible!! However, I could not wish anything worse on this remarkably foolish person than what he will experience if he keeps this up. This drug is NOT for a casual experimenter to play around with!! It is only appropriate for people like me, who have been diagnosed with Adult ADD by a licensed psychiatrist and who have been prescribed Focalin under his supervision. For me, it's a miracle, precisely because I do NOT experience the high, the speediness, and the crash described here. It gives me a functional brain, and that's it. Descriptions like this can lead laypeople to believe that us ADD and ADHD folks have found some kind of crafty way to get speed by prescription so we can all get high, but that is not the case at all. We DON'T experience it the way people with normal brains do! I would really like to see some information on Wiki that reflects our reality and the *medical* reality of atypical vs. normal reaction to psychostimulants. 

Thanks for your time, Wiki editors, and all the good work that you do...

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Microsoft JET Database Engine, or simply ''JET'', is a database engine distributed widely by Microsoft but now deprecated. As such, finding information on programming JET databases is becoming more and more difficult. This book attempts to remedy that by presenting necessary information about JET for programmers and database administrators.

This book assumes that the reader already has familiarity with SQL and requires a reference specifically for the JET database engine. Readers unfamiliar with SQL should first refer to the more generic database book [[Structured Query Language]].

==Just started==
I've just started this book, and it's time for dinner. Please note that the whilst it is only a table of contents for now, it ''will'' grow over the next couple of weeks. I'm so frustrated at having to pick up this nasty little database again, with bugger all documentation on its peculiarities, that I want to record once and for all how to use this little bugger just in case I (or anyone else) ever need to use it again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Taylor series====

A well-behaved function can be expanded into a power series. This means that for all non-negative integers &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; there are real numbers &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kx^k=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+a_4x^4+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Let us calculate the first four derivatives using &lt;math&gt;(x^n)'=n\,x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
f'(x)=a_1+2\,a_2x+3\,a_3x^2+4\,a_4x^3+5\,a_5x^4+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f''(x)=2\,a_2+2\cdot3\,a_3x+3\cdot4\,a_4x^2+4\cdot5\,a_5x^3+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f'''(x)=2\cdot3\,a_3+2\cdot3\cdot4\,a_4x+3\cdot4\cdot5\,a_5x^2+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f''''(x)=2\cdot3\cdot4\,a_4+2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\,a_5x+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Setting &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; equal to zero, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;
f(0)=a_0,\quad f'(0)=a_1,\quad f''(0)=2\,a_2,\quad f'''(0)=2\times3\,a_3,\quad f''''(0)=2\times3\times4\,a_4.
&lt;/math&gt;

Let us write &lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}(x)&lt;/math&gt; for the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th derivative of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x).&lt;/math&gt; We also write &lt;math&gt;f^{(0)}(x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; — think of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as the &quot;zeroth derivative&quot; of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x).&lt;/math&gt; We thus arrive at the general result &lt;math&gt;f^{(k)}(0)=k!\,a_k,&lt;/math&gt; where the ''factorial''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;k!&lt;/math&gt; is defined as equal to&amp;nbsp;1 for &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=1&lt;/math&gt; and as the product of all natural numbers &lt;math&gt;n\leq k&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&gt;1.&lt;/math&gt; Expressing the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the derivatives of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=0,&lt;/math&gt; we obtain

{| style=&quot;border:5px solid lightsteelblue&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;
f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty {f^{(k)}(0)\over k!}x^k=f(0)+f'(0)x+f''(0){x^2\over2!}+f'''(0){x^3\over3!}+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

This is the ''Taylor series'' for&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

A remarkable result: if you know the value of a well-behaved function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and the values of all of its derivatives ''at the single point'' &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; then you know &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at ''all'' points&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; Besides, there is nothing special about &lt;math&gt;x=0,&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is also determined by its value and the values of its derivatives at any other point&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;:

{| style=&quot;border:5px solid lightsteelblue&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;
f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty {f^{(k)}(x_0)\over k!}(x-x_0)^k.
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Restricting Use of su ==

Currently the section on this page titled '''Use su''' includes these two sentences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some systems require that you join the wheel group to have access to su. The requirement is that your username be listed in /etc/group on the line for group &quot;wheel&quot;, group id zero. This requirement does not exist on some systems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It seems reasonable to me to include a few sentences on how to create this requirement. Perhaps something like:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One way to enact this requirement is to modify the file permissions on &lt;code&gt;/bin/su&lt;/code&gt; to only allow members of group &quot;wheel&quot; to execute it. For example, my SUSE 10 installation originally had these permissions:&lt;pre&gt;-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root&lt;/pre&gt; I changed them to: &lt;pre&gt;-rwsr-xr-- 1 root wheel&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== [[Serial Programming:USB Technical Manual]] ==

This is an interesting subject, and it appears as though you are interested in getting something started along the lines of writing a Wikibook about this topic.  I would like to let you know that I'm interested in helping out here as well.

What I'd like to do here is perhaps restart something that would go int a full independent Wikibook rather than just something tied to the [[Serial Programming]] book.  I know I threw in the USB link, but my intention when adding this to the outline was to show how you could put in a &quot;virtual&quot; RS-232 data link via USB connectors to extend and expand upon the earlier discussions.  Certainly there is some considerable content that could be written about USB programming that is not widely available.

One of the problems I see that would face a would be independent software developer is the ability to set up a &quot;test bench&quot; for doing the software development.  For RS-232 programming, you can have a null modem that even loops back to the same computer (particularly in multi-tasking operating systems like Linux or Windows).  I've done this on a professional basis for quite a bit of code testing.  Unfortunately doing this with USB connectors is difficult or even dangerous.  Do you have any suggestions on how to set up some sort of test bench for would be USB experimentors to try different techniques?

I have thought about perhaps some simple low-cost USB development kits that we could set up, and even give schematics to make or even offer for sale (or show links to several vendors) that would allow this sort of development.

More to the point, I would like to cover this topic, but it needs to be written (from my viewpoint) as something which would allow &quot;hands on&quot; with actual hardware.  The range of possibilities is huge, as I've seen some very ingenious applications (like a fish tank and coffee mug heater) that go way beyond even just serial programming.  Writing USB drivers would be another interesting task to work with, and to cover some of the issues in regards to obtaining a &quot;device ID&quot; from a bureaucratic legal standpoint as well.

If you are interested in working on something like this, please drop me a line [[User talk:Robert Horning|on my talk page]].  I am quite interested in getting something like this going.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:21, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">====The exponential function====

We define the function &lt;math&gt;\exp(x)&lt;/math&gt; by requiring that

:&lt;math&gt;
\exp'(x)=\exp(x)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\exp(0)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

The value of this function is everywhere equal to its slope. Differentiating the first defining equation repeatedly we find that

:&lt;math&gt;
\exp^{(n)}(x)=\exp^{(n-1)}(x)=\cdots=\exp(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The second defining equation now tells us that &lt;math&gt;\exp^{(k)}(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; for all&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;k.&lt;/math&gt; The result is a particularly simple Taylor series:

&lt;br&gt;
{| style=&quot;border:5px solid lightsteelblue&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\exp(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty {x^k\over k!} =1+x+{x^2\over2}+{x^3\over6}+{x^4\over24}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
|}

&lt;br&gt;Let us check that a well-behaved function satisfies the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
f(a)\,f(b)=f(a+b)&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;
f^{(i+k)}(0)=f^{(i)}(0)\,f^{(k)}(0).&lt;/math&gt;

We will do this by expanding the &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;'s in powers of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and compare coefficents. We have

:&lt;math&gt;
f(a)\,f(b)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(i)}(0)f^{(k)}(0)}{i!\,k!}\,a^i\,b^k,&lt;/math&gt;

and using the binomial expansion

:&lt;math&gt;
(a+b)^i=\sum_{l=0}^i\frac{i!}{(i-l)!\,l!}\,a^{i-l}\,b^l,&lt;/math&gt;

we also have that

:&lt;math&gt;
f(a+b)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty {f^{(i)}(0)\over i!}(a+b)^i=
\sum_{i=0}^\infty\sum_{l=0}^i\frac{f^{(i)}(0)}{(i-l)!\,l!}\,a^{i-l}\,b^l=
\sum_{i=0}^\infty\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(i+k)}(0)}{i!\,k!}\,a^i\,b^k.
&lt;/math&gt;

Voilà.

The function &lt;math&gt;\exp(x)&lt;/math&gt; obviously satisfies &lt;math&gt;f^{(i+k)}(0)=f^{(i)}(0)\,f^{(k)}(0)&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;f(a)\,f(b)=f(a+b).&lt;/math&gt;

So does the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\exp(ux).&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, &lt;math&gt;f^{(i+k)}(0)=f^{(i)}(0)\,f^{(k)}(0)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}(0) = [f'(0)]^n.&lt;/math&gt;

We gather from this

* that the functions satisfying &lt;math&gt;f(a)\,f(b)=f(a+b)&lt;/math&gt; form a one-parameter family, the parameter being the real number &lt;math&gt;f'(0),&lt;/math&gt; and

* that the one-parameter family of functions &lt;math&gt;\exp(ux)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;f(a)\,f(b)=f(a+b)&lt;/math&gt;, the parameter being the real number&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;u.&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;f(x)=v^x&lt;/math&gt; also defines a one-parameter family of functions that satisfies &lt;math&gt;f(a)\,f(b)=f(a+b)&lt;/math&gt;, the parameter being the positive number&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;v.&lt;/math&gt;

Conclusion: for every real number &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; there is a positive number &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (and vice versa) such that &lt;math&gt;v^x=\exp(ux).&lt;/math&gt; 

One of the most important numbers is &lt;math&gt;e,&lt;/math&gt; defined as the number &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;u=1,&lt;/math&gt; that is: &lt;math&gt;e^x=\exp(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
e=\exp(1)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty{1\over n!}=1+1+{1\over2}+{1\over6}+\dots=
2.7182818284590452353602874713526\dots&lt;/math&gt;

----
&lt;br&gt;
The ''natural logarithm'' &lt;math&gt;\ln(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the inverse of &lt;math&gt;\exp(x),&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;\exp[\ln(x)]=\ln[\exp(x)]=x.&lt;/math&gt; Show that

:&lt;math&gt;{d\ln f(x)\over dx}={1\over f(x)}{df\over dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Reasons for not using JET */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{JET:Navigation}}
==What is JET?==
{{JET:TOC}}

JET is a SQL database engine distributed by Microsoft with several of its software products, most notably [[w:Microsoft Access|Microsoft Access]]. JET was an acronym that stood for ''Joint Engine Technology'', when JET was originally developed as a collection of core database technologies for use within Access, and later from Visual Basic and Visual Basic for Applications via an object-based interface called ''[[w:Data Access Objects|Data Access Objects]]'' (DAO).

JET presents the developer with the ability to create and manipulate relational databases on the local filesystem or on shared network folders. It is a modified form of [[w:ISAM|ISAM]], or ''Indexed Sequential Access Method'' databases. 

==Reasons for not using JET==

There are several good reasons for not using JET as a database technology, either when starting a new software project or when picking up maintenance on an old one.

* Microsoft have ceased support for JET, preferring instead to support newer database products based on their SQL Server product line. 
* Operation of JET from a 64-bit process requires use of a different driver. The connection string for access to a JET database using a 64-bit ADO program will contain a phrase like: &quot;Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0&quot;
* Technical information on JET is hard to find without a lot of digging, largely due to Microsoft dropping support for JET.
* JET is not as robust as more modern server-based database products, particularly in multi-user scenarios.
* JET SQL has many limitations that other database products don't have.
* JET stored procedures can only accommodate a single statement.
* JET databases, not being server-based, use far greater network bandwidth in multiuser applications.

==Why this book is still needed==

There is a very large installed base of JET databases worldwide, and despite Microsoft's intentions to replace JET with SQL Server and MSDE, this base is still growing &amp;ndash; people keep making new JET databases. Additionally, because JET is the default database sub-system used by Microsoft Access, it is very commonly used to create &quot;simple little databases&quot; that grow into monsters, often undocumented and unwieldy and, sadly, often built with little regard for good database design. 

It is often left to the professional programmer or database administrator to maintain these databases, and this may require some technical information about JET. Microsoft used to release documentation on programming JET in its [[w:Microsoft Developer Network|Microsoft Developer Network]] library, but it dropped documentation for JET SQL statements from the CD copy of the library after October 2001, along with the documentation for Access '97.

==Alternatives==

There are alternatives to maintaining a JET database, some of which are:

* Migrate the data from JET to Microsoft SQL Server using one of the many migration tools, and run the old application as JET linked tables in SQL Server transparently.
* Redesign the application to use Microsoft SQL Server natively, with many database statements remaining unchanged.
* Redesign the application to use another database, probably triggering a rewrite of many database statements.

These alternatives bear differing degrees of effort and risk. Depending on the associated costs and the future prospects for a database application (including its anticipated demise), it may be most viable to continue maintenance of the JET database.

OK, under &quot;Relationships With Other Characters&quot; I have no idea what the writer meant when he/she wrote that Katie Bell is &quot;shipped&quot; with Oliver Wood. Can someone explain this? I'll probably edit it out. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 13:08, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
:That's fan speak for &quot;presumed to be in a relation&lt;u&gt;ship&lt;/u&gt;&quot;. The writer is saying that fans had romantically linked Katie and Oliver, just as they had romantically linked Harry with Hermione, and with about as much grounding in canon. If you want to expand the meaning, go ahead, but it's worth adding that there is no grounds for such linkage; if I was doing it, though, I'd simply yank the reference.

==Text types==

There are two basic data types, plus a BLOB type, that are used to hold text values in JET databases. Prior to JET 4.0 they could only hold 8-bit text characters, but databases created with an Engine Type code of 5 or greater (i.e. JET 4.0) can also store Unicode characters.

Since JET 4.0, text values that are primarily one byte (8-bit) text characters are stored in two bytes unless otherwise specified. This increases the storage required for all text data, effectively doubling it. JET 4.0 has an additional property that can be set on text columns to compress text data to one-byte characters when it is able to. This property is set by specifying &lt;code&gt;WITH COMPRESSION&lt;/code&gt; on each text column that requires it. When a table is created in a JET database using Microsoft Access, text columns are normally created with this setting turned on (as ''Unicode compression'').

===Fixed-length text===

The &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; data type is used to store fixed-length text with up to 255 characters. Specifying the number of characters to store limits how big the column will be. Text values retrieved from a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; column are padded with spaces, if necessary, to the size of the column.

The &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; data type is not available from the Access designer.

The following statement creates a table with a 10-character text column and a 255-character text column, both with Unicode compression:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table T1 (c1 char(10) with compression, c2 char with compression)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Variable-length text===

The &lt;code&gt;varchar&lt;/code&gt; data type is used to store variable-length text with up to 255 characters.Text values retrieved from a &lt;code&gt;varchar&lt;/code&gt; column are trimmed of any trailing spaces.

The following statement creates a table with a 10-character text column and a 255-character text column, both with Unicode compression:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table T2 (c1 varchar(10) with compression, c2 varchar with compression)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Text BLOB===

The &lt;code&gt;longchar&lt;/code&gt; data type is used to store variable-length text with an unspecified number of characters, limited only by the maximum size of JET database files (2&amp;nbsp;GB &amp;ndash; about 1&amp;nbsp;billion uncompressed Unicode characters).

Some software libraries are able to handle &lt;code&gt;longchar&lt;/code&gt; columns as basic text columns, but others must use BLOB techniques for accessing their data. In particular, the ADO components so often used in Visual Basic, VBA and ASP applications can access &lt;code&gt;longchar&lt;/code&gt; columns as basic text when using the JET 4.0 OLE-DB provider to access the database, but must use BLOB handling routines (GetChunk / AppendChunk) when using an ODBC connection.

The following statement creates a table with two variable-length text BLOB columns, both with Unicode compression:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table T3 (tb1 longchar with compression, tb2 memo with compression)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Text pseudo-types===

The &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; data type is a pseudo-type. When a size is specified, it is taken to be a &lt;code&gt;varchar&lt;/code&gt; and is limited to 255 characters. When no size is specified, it is taken to be a &lt;code&gt;longchar&lt;/code&gt;.

The following statement creates a table with a 10-character text column and a variable-length text BLOB column, both with Unicode compression:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table T4 (c1 text(10) with compression, tb1 text with compression)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Numeric types==

There are several basic numeric data types available in JET, allowing for a wide range of data storage possibilities for numeric values.

===Byte===

The &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; data type is an 8-bit unsigned integer that can hold values between 0 and 255 inclusive. It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tinyint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;integer1&lt;/code&gt;.

It is analogous with the Visual Basic type &lt;code&gt;Byte&lt;/code&gt;.

===Smallint===

The &lt;code&gt;smallint&lt;/code&gt; data type is a 16-bit (2-byte) signed integer that can hold values between -32,768 and 32,767 inclusive. It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;smallint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;integer2&lt;/code&gt;. 

It is analogous with the Visual Basic type &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;.

===Integer===

The &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt; data type is a 32-bit (4-byte) signed integer that can hold values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 inclusive. It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;integer4&lt;/code&gt;. 

It is analogous with the Visual Basic type &lt;code&gt;Long&lt;/code&gt;.

===Single===

The &lt;code&gt;single&lt;/code&gt; data type is a 32-bit (4-byte) single precision floating point number that can hold values from -3.402823E38 to -1.401298E-45 for negative values, and 1.401298E-45 to 3.402823E38 for positive values. It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;single&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;float4&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IEEESingle&lt;/code&gt;. 

It is analogous with the Visual Basic type &lt;/code&gt;Single&lt;/code&gt;.

===Double===

The &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; data type is a 64-bit (8-byte) double precision floating point number that can hold values from -1.79769313486231E308 to 
-4.94065645841247E-324 for negative values, and 4.94065645841247E-324 to 1.79769313486232E308 for positive values. It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;double precision&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;float8&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IEEEDouble&lt;/code&gt;. 

It is analogous with the Visual Basic type &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;.

===Currency===

The &lt;code&gt;currency&lt;/code&gt; data type is a 64-bit (8-byte) exact precision decimal number (implemented as a scaled integer) that can hold values between -922,337,203,685,477.5808 and 922,337,203,685,477.5807 inclusive. It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;currency&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt;. 

It is analogous with the Visual Basic type &lt;code&gt;Currency&lt;/code&gt;.

===Decimal===

The &lt;code&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt; data type is a 17-byte exact precision decimal number that can hold values from -10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;-1 to 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;-1. It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dec&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;numeric&lt;/code&gt;.

==Boolean (Yes/No)==

JET supports a data type called &lt;code&gt;bit&lt;/code&gt; that can hold one bit of information, used for holding simple Boolean states of true or false. It can only hold the values 0 or 1, but some interfaces into the JET database present these as 0 and -1, or No and Yes. It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;bit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;logical&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;logical1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yesno&lt;/code&gt;.

It is analogous with the Visual Basic type &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt;.

==Dates and times==

The &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; data type is a 64-bit (8-byte) double precision floating point number that can hold both date and time information, in the range 1 January, 100 to 31 December, 9999 and with optional times in hours, minutes, seconds. It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt;, all capable of holding just date, just time, and both date and time information.

It is analogous with the Visual Basic type &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt;.

To determine whether a &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; holds time information, check to see whether the double precision number is the same as the integer truncation of that number; if they differ, then there is time information, otherwise there is no time information.

==Counters==

The &lt;code&gt;counter&lt;/code&gt; data type is an auto-incrementing 32-bit (4-byte) integer, often used for creating surrogate keys. It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;counter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;autoincrement&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;identity&lt;/code&gt;.

A &lt;code&gt;counter&lt;/code&gt; can take optional parameters, defining the initial value to start counting at, and the increment to add each time a new value is created. The following code shows both the default, starting at one with increment of one, and with specified start of 10 and increment of 2. Each table can have, at most, one column of type &lt;code&gt;counter&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table A1 (id1 counter, c1 char(1))
go
Create Table A2 (id2 counter(10, 2), c2 char(1))
go
Insert Into A1(c1) Values('x')
go
Insert Into A1(c1) Values('y')
go
Insert Into A2(c2) Values('x')
go
Insert Into A2(c2) Values('y')
go
Select * From A1
go
Select * From A2
go
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
id1         c1 
----------- ------
1           x
2           y

id2         c2
----------- ------
10          x
12          y
&lt;/pre&gt;

==BLOBs==

JET can store binary large objects, or BLOB data, in the database directly as binary data. Accessing this data typically requires special BLOB handling functions, for example, ADO provides the functions GetChunk and AppendChunk for reading and writing BLOB data.

===Binary===

The &lt;code&gt;binary&lt;/code&gt; data type is a variable-length binary object type that can hold up to 510 bytes of binary data. If the size is not specified, then the maximum size of 510 bytes is used. It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;binary&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;binary varying&lt;/code&gt;.

===Longbinary===

The &lt;code&gt;longbinary&lt;/code&gt; data type is a variable-length binary object type with an unspecified capacity, limited only by the maximum size of JET database files (2&amp;nbsp;GB). It can be referred to by the following aliases: &lt;code&gt;longbinary&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;general&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;oleobject&lt;/code&gt;.

The willows are deciduous trees and shrubs in the genus ''Salix'', part of the willow family [[../Salicaceae/]]. There are about 350 species in this genus worldwide, found primarily on moist soils in cooler zones in the Northern Hemisphere. Some smaller species may also be known by the common names osier and sallow; the latter name is derived from the same root as the Latin salix.

Some willows, particularly arctic and alpine species, are very small; the Dwarf Willow (''[[../Salix herbacea/]]'') rarely exceeds 6 cm in height, though spreading widely across the ground.

The Weeping Willow, very widely planted as an ornamental tree, is a cultivar, ''Salix'' × ''sepulcralis'' 'Chrysocoma', derived from a hybrid between the Chinese Peking Willow and the European White Willow.

Almost all willows take root very readily from cuttings or where broken branches lie on the ground. There are a few exceptions, including the Goat Willow and Peachleaf Willow. One famous example of such growth from cuttings involves the poet Alexander Pope, who begged a twig from a parcel tied with twigs sent from Spain to Lady Suffolk. This twig was planted and thrived, and legend has it that all of England's Weeping Willows are descended from this first one&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/221-aug09.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description==
The leaves are deciduous, often elongate but round to oval in a few species, and with a serrated margin. Willows are deciduous with male and female flowers appearing as catkins on different plants; the catkins are produced early in the spring, often before the leaves or as the new leaves open. The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous tiny (0.1 mm) seeds embedded in white down, which assists wind dispersal of the seeds. Willows hybridize freely, and numerous hybrids are known, both naturally occurring and in cultivation.

==Uses==
The bark of the willow tree has been mentioned in ancient texts from Assyria, Sumer and Egypt as a remedy for aches and fever, and the Greek physician Hippocrates wrote about its medicinal properties in the 5th century BC. Native Americans across the American continent relied on it as a staple of their medical treatments.

The active extract of the bark, called salicin, was isolated to its crystalline form in 1828 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist, and Raffaele Piria, an Italian chemist, who then succeeded in separating out the acid in its pure state. Salicin is acidic when in a saturated solution in water (pH = 2.4), and is called salicylic acid for that reason.

In 1897 Felix Hoffmann created a synthetically altered version of salicin (in his case derived from the Spiraea plant), which caused less digestive upset than pure salicylic acid. The new drug, formally Acetylsalicylic acid, was named aspirin by Hoffmann's employer Bayer AG. This gave rise to the hugely important class of drugs known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

==Maintenance==
A number of willow species were widely planted in Australia in the past, notably as erosion control measures along watercourses.  They are now regarded as an invasive weed and many catchment management authorities are removing them to be replaced with native trees &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/dpi/nreninf.nsf/childdocs/-1C62D26CD3AF6FE44A2568B300051289-8E21A59E53B35BEFCA256BC80005C14F-E1EB709D7DCE1BC9CA256F070003E8D8-FAC3FFA202EA6384CA256BCF000AD522?open&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoadley.net/cremer/willows/docs/WillowInBiodiversity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Want to erase your ex from a digital photo and refill the empty space as if nothing had ever happened? Want to make your computer imitate a small sample picture to fill up your huge desktop background? Then texture synthesis is your weapon of choice. Learn about enlarging images, an aged and slow but surprisingly powerful method of making small pictures big.

== What do we want to do? ==
Imagine we had a small photo of a wooden surface, this size:

[[Image:Ahorn-Maser Holz.JPG|100px|center]]

We'd like to make a wallpaper for our computer's desktop from this picture, meeting the following demands:
# The resulting image shall be any size we want.
# The resulting image shall resemble the sample.
# The resulting image shall look smooth and not repetitive.

== What's the problem? ==
*&lt;span style=&quot;text-transform: uppercase; font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;W&lt;/big&gt;hy don't we just stretch the sample?&lt;/span&gt; Stretching is a horrible thing to do. The picture is made up of pixels that will show up as ugly square blocks in the final image:

[[Image:Pixel-example.png|250px|center]]

&lt;span style=&quot;text-transform: uppercase; font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;W&lt;/big&gt;hy don't we use the desktop's option that says &quot;&lt;big&gt;T&lt;/big&gt;ile image&quot;?&lt;/span&gt; This is just as horrible as stretching. Tiling means duplicating the image and pasting it next to itself over and over again. This may work alright for &quot;pattern textures&quot;, whose borders fit to one another. With the maple burl from above, it looks boring and unfitted:

&lt;div style=&quot;width:200px; margin: 0px auto;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Ahorn-Maser Holz.JPG|100px]][[Image:Ahorn-Maser Holz.JPG|100px]]&lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Ahorn-Maser Holz.JPG|100px]][[Image:Ahorn-Maser Holz.JPG|100px]]
&lt;/div&gt;

It is quite simple to satisfy the first two of our demands, but very hard to meet the last one.

== What's so special about textures? ==
To tackle our task, it helps to take a closer look at what makes texture texture. Compare the following two rows of pictures and think about what separates texture from &quot;normal&quot; images:

{| style=&quot;width:400px; margin:0px auto;&quot;

Eventually, you came up with some of the following thoughts:
* Texture is a kind of &lt;span style=&quot;text-transform: uppercase; font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;surface structure&lt;/span&gt; with some more or less regular pattern, like the wood burl that covers the table.
* No matter where you direct your gaze in a texture, &lt;span style=&quot;text-transform: uppercase; font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;it looks all the same&lt;/span&gt;, not like a face where each part has its position.
* Single objects, &lt;span style=&quot;text-transform: uppercase; font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;scaled down and repeated similarly&lt;/span&gt; over and over again become texture, like the single brick that becomes texture in the brick wall.

== How does stationarity help us? ==
&lt;span style=&quot;text-transform: uppercase; font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;T&lt;/big&gt;exture looks the same, no matter what part of the picture you look at.&lt;/span&gt; This is called &lt;span style=&quot;text-transform: uppercase; font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;stationarity&lt;/span&gt; and it is this thought that best sums up the idea that is known by the distressing name &lt;span style=&quot;text-transform: uppercase; font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;M&lt;/big&gt;arkov &lt;big&gt;R&lt;/big&gt;andom &lt;big&gt;F&lt;/big&gt;ield&lt;/span&gt;.

Imagine I'd blacken one of the pixels in our maple burl image and asked you to set the pixel's color so the resulting image looks smooth. Would you set the color to green? Obviously not, because green doesn't turn up anywhere in the image and surely wouldn't make the result look smooth. Eventually, you'd choose some sort of brown. But which shade of brown? Would you choose brown if the pixel was amidst a field of white pixels?

The random field idea is this: &lt;span style=&quot;text-transform: uppercase; font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;each pixel's color depends on the colors of its neighboring pixels only&lt;/span&gt;.

== What's the point? ==
This is the central idea of the algorithm we will now take a closer look at:

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|width=&quot;25%&quot;|
|width=&quot;50%&quot;|
Set a blackened pixel's color by searching a pixel in the sample image that has a similar neighborhood.
|width=&quot;25%&quot;|
|}

== Develop the algorithm ==
=== Prepare the field ===
First of all, create an empty picture of desired width and height, the &quot;field&quot;. In our case, this is an image that resembles the dimensions of our desktop.

=== Sow the seed ===
We will now fill the empty picture. To do so we need something to start with, a &quot;seed&quot;. Therefore, we copy a small, randomly chosen piece of the sample image to the empty field.

=== Grow the image ===
Now, we will grow the seed, pixel by pixel, until it fills all of the image. First, make a list of all empty pixels that lie next to a pixel that is already filled. In the beginning, these are the pixels flanking the seed.

Randomly choose one pixel of this list. We will now determine the color of this pixel. Therefore we do not need the pixel itself but its neighborhood.

=== Find a match ===
Compare the neighborhood to the neighborhoods of ''all'' the pixels in the sample image, one after the other. Whenever you find a similar neighborhood, add the corresponding sample image's pixel to a list of &quot;good matches&quot;.

=== Grow one pixel ... ===
When we have finished comparing we have a candidate list of pixels with similar neighborhoods. Now, randomly choose one of these candidates and set the empty pixel's color to the candidate's color.

=== ... and start all over again ===
Proceed to the next empty pixel. If there are no more empty pixels in our list, it's time to create a new list of empty pixels and start all over again. If there are no more empty pixels in the &quot;field&quot;, we have finished.

Occasionally Wikibookians may find themselves at an impasse on which direction a book should go, and may ask for or need outside assistance.

To begin the process, make a request for comments on [[WB:RFC]] under the &quot;Requests for Mediation&quot; section. Uninvolved Wikibookians will then have a look at the dispute, and give some opinions on how to reach a compromise. The parties to the dispute should then take a week or two to consider these opinions, and try to work out a solution. 

If the impasse cannot be resolved within 2 weeks of the opinions being rendered, one or both parties may request moderation. Moderations are carried out by an active administrator, who will weigh the arguments and impose a solution. This solution will be announced on the [[WB:AN|Administrator's Noticeboard]], and if there are objections from members of the community ''aside from the involved parties'' there may be a further discussion, following these conditions:
*The moderator's solution will be kept in force during that discussion 
*The original moderator will hand over any enforcement responsibilities to another administrator.
*This further discussion shall last no more than one week from when it starts.

A review of the decision may (upon request) be made at least 2 months later, to see if it was effective in allowing for the improvement of the book.</text>

I think the problem with setting up an arbitration board and such is that it's just not all that easy to rally up a group of actors on wikibooks. The goal of this version of the policy is to allow for quick and efficient resolution without having to drag the whole project into a big row.

My hope is that it would go like this:
#An impasse is reached, and outside opinions are sought and given
#If the opinions aren't enough to get the 2 parties to reach an accord, it goes to moderation. 
#The moderator makes his or her decision, announces it, and enforces it.
#If uninvolved parties think the decision is unfair, it should be reviewed, and changes made to the decision is there is a consensus to do so.
#The matter is closed, though it can be reviewed after a good long cooling off period, and any restrictive measures looked at to see if they are still necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Behavioral Genetics==
&lt;center&gt;''A devil, a born devil, on whose nature nurture can never stick; on whom my pains humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost'' -- The Tempest, William Shakespeare 1610&lt;/center&gt;

Behavioral genetics is the field of biology that studies the heritability of behavioral traits in animal (including human) behavior. The field has formed from an overlap of genetics, ethology and psychology. 

===Basic Concepts===
Genetic characteristics are those that are to a large extent determined by genes. Although genes may play a role in many behaviors, they never determine them. There are no genes that directly code for a behavior - genes only code for proteins. However, it is clear that a change in a single protein can cause a host of downstream effects and may even bring about a distinct phenotype.The external environment exerts a strong influence on how all genes are expressed in behavior via a development of nervous and hormonal mechanisms. The '''Phenotype''' (i.e., the observable characteristics of an organism) emerges from an interaction of its '''Genotype''' (i.e., the organism's genetic composition) with environmental factors. A '''Gene''' is the smallest functional unit of heredity and is composed of DNA. It specifies the codes for amino acid chains that make up individual proteins (e.g., serum albumin). A '''Locus''' is a section on a chromosome that relates in a meaningful way to a function. '''Monomorphic''' loci are loci with a single common segment of code, and which is present in 95-99% of individuals. In contrast, '''polymorphic''' loci exist in form of two or more '''alleles''' (i.e., versions of the same position of the chromosome) with a combined frequency&gt;0.05. Diploid organisms carry two copies of each gene, one derived from each parent. '''Homozygous''' is the condition in which both of these copies for that gene are identical (i.e., the same allele). If the chromosomes contain two different alleles of the gene, it is called '''heterozygous'''. In some cases the phenotype of heterozygous individuals follows one allele (i.e., the '''dominant''' one) and not the other (i.e., the '''recessive''' allele). Recessive phenotypes will only be expressed in cases where the individual is homozygous for that allele. If one gene pattern is well established and common in a particular organism, it is referred to as the '''wild type''' allele. In contrast, a '''mutant''' allele usually represents a relatively new, and less common modification. '''Pleiotropy''' refers to the situation where there is no clear 1:1 correspondence between one particular gene and a particular behavioral trait. For instance, fruitflies with a mutant ''period'' gene display a range of behavioral effects, ranging from differences in daily activity rhythms, time of day at which adults hatch from pupae, and the particular patterning of the male's courtship song. '''Heritability''' is a statistical estimate of variation in a trait that is attributable to genetic differences among individuals within a group. For instance, the number of arms humans have is heritable and can be expressed as a proportion. Variables such as an individual's fingerprint and height are strongly heritable, while other variables such as musical abilities are much less so.

===Classical Genetics===
'''Classical (or Mendelian) genetics''' examines the distribution of hereditary characteristics of behaviors from one generation to the next. With selective breeding, the presence/absence of specific behaviors can be tracked through the outcomes of sexual reproduction. From such work came the realization that genes existed, that individuals are diploid with one half of the genes contributed by each parents, and that some genes dominate the phenotype over others. The genetics of many diseases follows simple Mendelian rules while examples of behavior in this category are generally few. Rather than in a small number of discrete states, most morphological/behavioral traits (body size, intelligence, boldness) occur across a continuous phenotypic range.

:* Seymour Benzer discovered a series of behavioral mutants in fruit flies, including single gene disruptions of circadian rhythms (''period''), and various genetic causes in neurodegeneration and aging.
:*'''Hygienic bees''': Hygienic behavior in honey bees involves the ability to detect and remove diseased, larval and pupal brood from the nest before the pathogen becomes infectious. Forming a mechanism of resistance to bee diseases and parasitic mites, it consists of two distinct task-components: uncapping a cells and removing its content. Rothenbuhler (1964) suggested that these two traits were controlled in a simple Mendelian manner by two recessive loci. More recent molecular evidence from '''quantitative trait loci''' (QTL) linkage mapping has identified multiple specific stretches of DNA with genes that underly variation in this trait. This work suggests that the genetic basis of hygienic behavior is considerably more complex, and that seven QTLs are associated with hygienic behavior, each controlling only 9-15% of the observed phenotypic variance.

'''Quantitative genetics''' explores the inheritance of characteristics that. Such traits are often subject to significant environmental influences and usually involve a great number of underlying genes. Although each gene may well follow a simple Mendelian pattern, overall results are not easily characterized in these terms. Quantitative approaches are essential to studying the degree to which relatedness among Individuals is matched by resemblances in behavioral characteristics. It thus aims to estimate the proportion of total phenotypic variance that is explained by relatedness. Aside from cases where multiple genes affect single traits, changes in one individual gene may impact quite a number of different traits. Such instances can be identified and characterized through measures of phenotypic covariance across multiple traits.

===Population Genetics===
'''Population genetics''' concerns itself with mechanisms that change the relative occurrence of genes within a population. It examines how gene frequencies change or become stabilized within populations through behavioral forces such as sexual selection, mating systems, dominance, or territoriality.

===Developmental Genetics===
Developmental genetics explores how genetics interfaces with ontogenetic processes in behavior. Genetics plays an integral role in the control of cell growth and differentiation, formation of tissues, organs and hormone systems, as well as in the emergence and critical timing of learning opportunities, cognitive abilities, and emotional systems.

Microarray technology is able to characterize levels of activity for many genes simultaneously. This technique measures how many copies of different mRNAs are made when genes are turned on.

===Examples===
====Behavioral Mutants in Fruit Flies====

====Migration paths of European Warblers====
{{Animal Behavior Example stub}}
 
Migration has been defined in a number of ways; it can best be described as when animals continue to travel further from their ‘home range’ till such a time that they begin to become responsive to resources. This type of move in birds appears to be strategic, particularly in coping with changes in temperature accompanied by seasonal variation as well as the abundance of food.
For several decades studies conducted on the European Sylvia warblers (Garden warblers -Sylvia borin and Blackcaps-Sylvia atricapailla particularly) have shed light on the various aspects of migration such as the underlying mechanisms. These birds have proved to be excellent models for studying migration as they contain migrant populations that fly to different regions as well as non-migrant populations that remain sedentary. The Blackcaps breed throughout Europe, parts of western Asia and North Africa; those populations from Central and North Europe migrate to Southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Similarly, the Garden warblers migrate from Europe to Northern Africa. In studies on Blackcaps from southern Germany, researchers were able to show that hybrids of migratory and non-migratory populations developed migratory activity; the degree of activity was found to be intermediate to that of the parents. Furthermore, the genetic mechanism appears to be under the control of multi-locus system; if it were governed by a single locus system all F1 generation would be expected to show the same migratory activity. 
Several questions arise such as how does a juvenile know where to fly and when does a migrant know to end its journey? Vector navigation can be defined as an inherent quality that enables juveniles to determine the direction and duration of flight. 
Using a series of cross breeding experiments it was determined that the direction of orientation was also under genetic control as the offspring of migratory and non-migratory species showed directional preferences that matched those of the migratory parents. Additional evidence from cross breeding experiments between Austrian Blackcaps (which fly in a southeasterly direction) and German Blackcaps (which fly southwesterly) determined that the offspring flew in an intermediary direction. As for the inexperienced migrant knows when to end its journey this appears to be regulated genetically. According to the vector-navigation hypothesis where the patterns of migration activity as well as the direction for migration appear to be inherited. Additional cross breeding experiments between German Blackcaps and Blackcaps from the Canaries showed that the pattern of activity was found to be intermediate to that of the parents.
Through several studies on European warblers, it was shown that the ability to migrate is hereditary as well as the direction in which the birds migrate. The degree of activity (intense migration versus sedentariness) was also inherited.

====Parental Behavior and ''fosB'' Mutant Mice====
Like most mammals, wild-type female mice are generally very effective in their maternal care. However, females that are deficient of this protein exhibit a marked indifference towards their pups.

====Behavioral Traits in Breeds of Hunting Dogs====
A number of dog breeds have emerged with specializations of behaviors suitable for hunting small game. Such breeds of gun dogs, including pointers, setters, spaniels, and retrievers, readily display behaviors for identifying, flushing, and retrieving small game. In '''pointing behavior''', dogs search for and identity potential prey, but refrain from actually stalking and potentially flushing it. Instead they remain frozen into immobility, facing it from nearby. '''Retrieving behavior''' is shown by individuals who seize and return to the pack carrying dead or wounded prey, even when they had not attacked it themselves. The antecedents for such behaviors appear to be widely present during group-hunting of most canine predators. They are largely characteristics of young individuals who have recently joined a pack for the hunt, are not fully participating in it yet, and who are largely restricted to junior, supporting roles. Common breeds of gun dogs combine this fairly intermediate degree of juvenile behavior with fairly adult canine morphologies.

{{miskito_comment|Yet another use of '''ra''' is with some direct objects. It is hard to give an exact rule about which direct objects take '''ra''' and which do not, but simplifying we can give the rule of thumb: use '''ra''' with ''animate'' objects (i.e. people and animals).

'''auya'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#ecf3f7&quot; |
wa'''ras'''
|}
In most cases we can obtain the verbs stem just by removing '''-aia''', and to the resulting stem the regular endings ('''-isa, -ras''' etc.) are then added. Any exceptions will be noted as they arise. Notice in particular that the infinitive of the irregular verb &quot;to be&quot; (present: '''sa''') is '''kaia'''!

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
= A struct as defined and used in Octave =

A '''structure''' in Octave groups different data types called fields in a single object. Fields are accessed by their names.

== Declaring a structure ==

A structure is declared by assigning values to its fields. A period (.) separates the name of the field and the name of the structure:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; city.name = 'Liege';
 &gt;&gt; city.country = 'Belgium';
 &gt;&gt; city.longitude = 50.6333;
 &gt;&gt; city.latitude = 5.5666;
&lt;/source&gt;
The fields of a structure and their values can be displayed by simply entering the name of the struct:

 &gt;&gt; city
 city =
 {
   name = Liege
   country = Belgium
   longitude =  50.633
   latitude =  5.5666
 }

== Manipulating structures ==

A structure can be copied as any objects:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; city_copy = city;
&lt;/source&gt;
In most circumstance, the fields of a structure can be manipulated with the period operator. The value of a field can be overwritten by:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; city.name = 'Outremeuse';
&lt;/source&gt;
In the same way, the value of a field can be retrieved by:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; city.name
 ans = Outremeuse
&lt;/source&gt;
The function ''isstruct'' can be used to test if object is a structure or not. With the function ''fieldnames'' all field names are returned as a cell array:

 &gt;&gt; fieldnames(city)
 ans =
 {
   [1,1] = name
   [2,1] = country
   [3,1] = longitude
   [4,1] = latitude
 }

To test if a structure contains the a given field named, the function ''isfield'' can be used:

 &gt;&gt; isfield(city,'name')
 ans =  1

The value of a field can be extract with ''getfield'':
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; getfield(city,'name')
 ans = Liege
&lt;/source&gt;
or using

 &gt;&gt; city.('name')
 ans = Liege

In a similar way, the value of a field can be set with ''setfield'':
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; setfield(city,'name','Outremeuse')
&lt;/source&gt;
The functions ''isfield'', ''getfield'' and ''setfield'' are useful when the names of a structure are determined during execution of the program.

You can remove a field of a struct array with the ''rmfield'' function.
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; city = rmfield(city, 'name');
&lt;/source&gt;
would remove the 'name' field from the city struct and copy the result back onto the original structure.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A period of one year after which major (often audited) financial statements are prepared.  The activity involved in preparing these statements is commonly referred to as &quot;year end&quot;.  Many enterprises has a fiscal year that starts January 1 and ends December 31.  Some enterprises have a fiscal year that starts at another time during the year (e.g. Oct 1 - Sep 30).  Normally once a fiscal year has been established it is not changed.

A fiscal year is sub-divided in several accounting periods.  Most business use a month as their accounting period.  Financial statements are commonly prepared at the end of each accounting period.  This activity is commonly referred to as &quot;month end&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Patience sorting}}
==C++==
Given a generic STL-style input iterator to a sequence, we shall call its elements'
value type &lt;code&gt;card_type&lt;/code&gt;, and assume that we have some container of cards &lt;code&gt;PileType&lt;/code&gt;
(an example could be &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;card_type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), and a container of piles &lt;code&gt;TableType&lt;/code&gt;
(which, again, could be just a vector of piles).

In this case, one can define the patience sorting as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
    /**
     * Patience sort algorithm as per Aldous and Diaconis,
     * using binary search to select the leftmost heap for a new card.
     * Compares cards using operator&lt;
     * 
     * TableType requirements
     *  -# whatever lower_bound needs
     *  -# begin(), end(): ForwardIterator of piles
     * 
     * PileType requirements
     *  -# default constructible
     *  -# constructible from a single card const reference
     *      typedef typename PileType::value_type card_type;
     *  -# push_back(const card_type&amp;)
     *  -# assignable, lightweight on a singleton pile
     *  -# whatever lower_bound needs
     *  -# back() implemented or an appropriate pile_less specialization
     */
    template &lt; typename PileType, typename TableType, typename InputIterator &gt; 
    void patience_sort(TableType&amp; table, InputIterator first, InputIterator last) {
        typedef PileType pile_type;
        typedef typename PileType::value_type card_type;
        typedef TableType table_type;
        typedef typename table_type::iterator iterator;
  
        while (first != last) {
            pile_type new_pile(*first); // read *first only once! (input iterator)
            // find the leftmost heap with the top card greater 
            // than *first , to push *first on it
            iterator pile_p = std::lower_bound(
                                table.begin(), table.end(), new_pile, 
                                pile_less&lt;pile_type&gt;() );
            if (pile_p != table.end()) {
                pile_p-&gt;push_back(new_pile.back());
            }
            // ...or allocate a new heap on the right with *first
            else {
                table.push_back(new_pile);
            }
            first++;
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

For the ''std::lower_bound'' algorithm to work, a tiny utility comparator functor is needed:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  /**
   * Comparator for two piles according to their top card values.
   * Compares cards using operator&lt;
   */
  template &lt; typename pile_type &gt;
  struct pile_less : std::binary_function&lt;pile_type, pile_type, bool&gt;
  {
      bool operator()(const pile_type&amp; x, const pile_type&amp; y) const
      {
          return x.back() &lt; y.back();
      }
  };
/**
 * When the algorithm is run with the sole purpose to discover the length of the longest increasing subsequence, 
 * one doesn't need to store any cards in the piles beneath the topmost one, since only the topmost card's value
 * is ever used by the algorithm above, and the length of the longest increasing subsequence is equal to the number of piles on the
 * table,
 * i.e., ''table.size()'':
 */
    /** 
     * A class representing a pile that is sticky, i.e., once a card
     * is put onto its top, it's glued forever. This way, only
     * the top card is actually remembered (O(1) memory per heap).
     * Used by longest_increasing_subsequence().
     *
     * Unfortunately, such heap is impossible to use in more advanced
     * algorithms, such as the Bespamyatnykh and Segal one, for the
     * actual longest increasing subsequence recovery.
     */
    template&lt; typename Card &gt;
    struct StickyPile { // cards stick together when put here :-)
        typedef Card value_type;
        typedef const value_type&amp; const_reference;
        StickyPile(const Card&amp; _card) : card(_card) {}
        void push_back(const Card&amp; _card) { card = _card; }
        const_reference back() const { return card; }
    private:
        Card card;
    };
  
    /** Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence
     * given by the given iterator range, using patience_sort().
     * Compares cards using operator&lt;
     */
    template&lt; typename InputIterator &gt;
    size_t longest_increasing_subsequence( 
            InputIterator first, InputIterator last)
    {
        typedef typename std::iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::value_type Card;
        typedef StickyPile&lt;Card&gt; pile_type;
        typedef std::vector&lt; pile_type &gt; table_type;
        table_type table;
        patience_sort&lt;pile_type&gt;(table, first, last);
        return table.size();
    }

/* The above GPL code is based on excerpts from [[http://www.tarunz.org/~vassilii/pub/c++/patience_sort.hpp patience_sort.hpp]],
 which also provides versions of the same functionality parametrized by any given comparator (rather than using operator&lt; ). */

I am currently a student studying Software Development. I enjoy Painting, Computers, Reading and I have an interest in Carnivous Plants. I have also been a student of Fine Arts before I went into a career of computers.

====What I want to do for WikiBooks====
I enjoy Computer Programming and I want to share my interest with the world. I Love the old programming languages like QBasic, Pascal and ADA, as well as web technologies such as PHP, HTML and Javascript. I got interested in this wiki site when I read the QBasic Manual and I found it needed improvment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm in no way qualified to instructor drivers for emergency vehicles, but I'm kind of confused on what exactly the page is supposed to be.  A course outline of sorts, or a job description?  If it is to be a functional job description, then there are two core job areas, that is vehicle movement, and on-board fire fighting equipment use.  I didn't rearrange any sections because I wasn't sure what was supposed to happen.  [[User:Mcmillen76|Mcmillen76]] 04:05, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">====The indefinite integral====

How do we add up infinitely many infinitesimal areas? This is elementary if we know a function &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; of which &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the first derivative. If &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{dF}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;dF(x)=f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx=\int_a^b dF(x)=F(b)-F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

All we have to do is to add up the infinitesimal amounts &lt;math&gt;dF&lt;/math&gt; by which &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; increases as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; increases from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;b,&lt;/math&gt; and this is simply the difference between &lt;math&gt;F(b)&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

A function &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; of which &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the first derivative is called an ''integral'' or ''antiderivative'' of &lt;math&gt;f(x).&lt;/math&gt; Because the integral of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is determined only up to a constant, it is also known as ''indefinite'' integral of &lt;math&gt;f(x).&lt;/math&gt; Note that wherever &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is negative, the area between its graph and the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis counts as negative. 

How do we calculate the integral &lt;math&gt;I=\int_a^b dx\,f(x)&lt;/math&gt; if we don't know any antiderivative of the ''integrand'' &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;? Generally we look up a table of integrals. Doing it ourselves calls for a significant amount of skill. As an illustration, let us do the Gaussian integral

:&lt;math&gt;
I=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dx\,e^{-x^2/2}.&lt;/math&gt;

For this integral someone has discovered the following trick. (The trouble is that different integrals generally require different tricks.) Start with the square of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
I^2=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\!dx\,e^{-x^2/2}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\!dy
\,e^{-y^2/2}=
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\!\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\!dx\,dy\,e^{-(x^2+y^2)/2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This is an integral over the &lt;math&gt;x{-}y&lt;/math&gt; plane. Instead of dividing this plane into infinitesimal rectangles &lt;math&gt;dx\,dy,&lt;/math&gt; we may divide it into concentric rings of radius&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and infinitesimal width&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;dr.&lt;/math&gt; Since the area of such a ring is &lt;math&gt;2\pi r\,dr,&lt;/math&gt; we have that

:&lt;math&gt;
I^2=2\pi\int_0^{+\infty}\!dr\,r\,e^{-r^2/2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now there is only one integration to be done. Next we make use of the fact that &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\,r^2}{dr}=2r,&lt;/math&gt; hence &lt;math&gt;dr\,r=d(r^2/2),&lt;/math&gt; and we introduce the variable &lt;math&gt;w=r^2/2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
I^2=2\pi\int_0^{+\infty}\!d\left({r^2/2}\right)e^{-r^2/2}=
2\pi\int_0^{+\infty}\!dw\,e^{-w}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since we know that the antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;e^{-w}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-e^{-w},&lt;/math&gt; we also know that

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^{+\infty}\!dw\,e^{-w}=(-e^{-\infty})-(-e^{-0})=0+1=1.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;I^2=2\pi&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\!dx\,e^{-x^2/2}=\sqrt{2\pi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Believe it or not, a significant fraction of the literature in theoretical physics concerns variations and elaborations of this basic ''Gaussian'' integral.

One variation is obtained by substituting &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a}\,x&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\!dx\,e^{-ax^2/2}=\sqrt{2\pi/a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another variation is obtained by thinking of both sides of this equation as functions of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and differentiating them with respect to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;a.&lt;/math&gt; The result is

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dx\,e^{-ax^2/2}x^2=\sqrt{2\pi/a^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Sine and cosine====

We define the function &lt;math&gt;\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt; by requiring that

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos''(x)=-\cos(x),\quad \cos(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\cos'(0)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

If you sketch the graph of this function using only this information, you will notice that wherever &lt;math&gt;\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt; is positive, its slope decreases as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; increases (that is, its graph curves downward), and wherever &lt;math&gt;\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt; is negative, its slope increases as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; increases (that is, its graph curves upward).

Differentiating the first defining equation repeatedly yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos^{(n+2)}(x)=-\cos^{(n)}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for all natural numbers&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n.&lt;/math&gt; Using the remaining defining equations, we find that &lt;math&gt;\cos^{(k)}(0)&lt;/math&gt; equals&amp;nbsp;1 for k&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,4,8,12…, –1&amp;nbsp;for k&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2,6,10,14…, and&amp;nbsp;0 for odd&amp;nbsp;k. This leads to the following Taylor series:

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!} = 1-{x^2\over2!}+ {x^4\over4!} -{x^6\over6!}+\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; is similarly defined by requiring that

:&lt;math&gt;
\sin''(x)=-\sin(x),\quad \sin(0)=0,\quad\hbox{and}\quad \sin'(0)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to the Taylor series

:&lt;math&gt;
\sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x-{x^3\over3!}+ {x^5\over5!} -{x^7\over7!}+\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

== Name change ==

Noticing the change you made (which looks fine) I wondered what you wanted to do with [[Finance/Contributors]] and indeed [[Finance/To do]].  Thanks and regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

::Basically, as the editor, your decision, I don't see leaving the redirects as an issue but I'm happy to &quot;tidy&quot; if you want me too.  For your information deletion templates are [[Wikibooks:Template_messages/Deletion|here]] so you can mark pages if your plans change or you find you have a redundant page.

*reset
Hi Venky - I need some more info to begin to help you on this.  What &quot;bi&quot; template and what info box?  Main question would be is it due to the renaming? (So it is still pointing to Finance?).

This bit is my mistake - assuming you want the pages deleted the template that you need is {{tl|Delete|Not required now or your reason}}.  The one you have used is intended for use on frequently recreated vandal pages!  

By the way, user boxes are usually placed on the user page rather than the user talk page. Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:05, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

:OK - the speedy deletes were done just fine and I have deleted them.  I am puzzled on the bi template and infobox issue - I'm not sure I'm understanding what you are trying to do.  [[Infobox/Principles of Finance]] is there and looks ok?

:Could you take a look at your &quot;signature&quot; - this is not a big issue but it allows folk to get to your page easily.  If you go to &quot;my preferences&quot; (top row if you are using the default monobook config) you can fill in the nickname there which will show as your signature (me - I always copy what is around and then edit it to be the way I want it!) - take a look at the sigs that are around &amp; you'll work it out (if it is &quot;fancy&quot; you will need to check the &quot;raw signatures&quot; box).  Ask again if you need help tho - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:35, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

== Sig ==

Took me a while if it helps!!  You should be able to work something out from my sig (or those of others around - just &quot;edit&quot; anything with an interesting sig, remembering to &quot;cancel&quot; rather than save).  The bi one I'll take some time and look at - it will be tomorrow now, if you are in more of a hurry the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] should get you help quicker.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:56, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

== Infobox ==

Hi Venky - did you look at [[Infobox]] - as far as I can see the box for your book looks like it is doing what it should? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:38, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Creating a JET database==
{{JET:TOC}}
There are many ways to create a JET database, a few of which are addressed below. How a database is created should not matter, except that the engine type of the database defines what JET SQL capabilities will be available.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! JET version !! Engine Type code
|-
| JET 1.0 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 1
|-
| JET 1.1 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 2
|-
| JET 2.0 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 3
|-
| JET 3.x 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 4
|-
| JET 4.x 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 5
|}

===Creating from Access===

By far, the easiest way to create a new JET database is to use [[w:Microsoft Access|Microsoft Access]].

# Start Microsoft Access
# From the menu, select &lt;code&gt;File → New&lt;/code&gt; or press &lt;code&gt;Control-N&lt;/code&gt;
# Select &quot;Blank database&quot;
# Navigate to where you want to save your database in the filesystem, and give it a name

You can then use the various database and security utilities to set things like the engine type, encryption, optional system database, and users / passwords.

===Creating from ODBC===

An empty JET database can be created from Windows by creating a new ODBC DSN (Data Source Name) and creating the database from the ODBC connection window.

[[Image:ODBC make JET 1.png|right]]
Start the ODBC Data Sources applet from the Windows Control Panel, and click Add to make a new DSN. You should see a screen like the one on the right. Select the driver for Microsoft Access, and click Finish.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:ODBC make JET 2.png|right]]
You should be presented with a screen for configuring a new Microsoft Access DSN, like the one on the right. Click the Create button, to get the New Database window up.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:ODBC make JET 3.png|right]]
You should now see the New Database window. Navigate to where you want to put your JET database, enter a name, and choose any special options like engine type (Format), encryption, and whether to have a separate system database, then click OK to create your database. You can now cancel out of the ODBC Data Sources applet without making the new DSN if you like, as you probably want to connect to it via OLE-DB anyway!
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

===Creating from ADOX===

Visual Basic code for creating a JET 4.0 compatible database:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim cat As ADOX.Catalog
Dim create_string As String

create_string = &quot;Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Jet OLEDB:Engine Type=5;&quot;
create_string = create_string &amp; &quot;Data Source=&quot; &amp; path_to_database &amp; &quot;;&quot;

If JET_encryption_wanted Then
    create_string = create_string &amp; &quot;Jet OLEDB:Encrypt Database=True;&quot;
End If

Set cat = CreateObject(&quot;ADOX.Catalog&quot;)
cat.Create create_string
&lt;/source&gt;

==Compacting a JET database==

JET databases do not reuse space released by deleting old data. This leads to databases growing in size over time, and can lead to performance problems or even failures if the database grows too large. To overcome this, a database needs to be compacted periodically, to remove the unused space and reduce the file size.

===Compacting from Access===

The easiest way to compact a JET database is to open it in Microsoft Access and perform an operation called ''Compact and Repair Database'', found under the ''Tools'' menu. However, this may not be possible if the database is located remotely and is not accessible via the Windows filesystem.

===Compacting with JRO===
The JET runtime system is distributed with a component library called JET Replication Objects (JRO). The following Visual Basic code uses JRO to compact a JET database:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
' declare Windows API functions
Declare Function MoveFileEx Lib &quot;kernel32&quot; Alias &quot;MoveFileExA&quot; _
    (ByVal lpExistingFileName As String, ByVal lpNewFileName As String, _
    ByVal dwFlags As Long) As Long

' build connection strings for database and temporary file
Dim cx as string
Dim src_cx As String
Dim tgt_cx As String

cx = &quot;Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Jet OLEDB:Engine Type=5;&quot;

If uses_database_password Then
    cx = cx &amp; &quot;Jet OLEDB:Database Password=&quot; &amp; database_password
ElseIf uses_username_password Then
    cx = cx &amp; &quot;User ID=&quot; &amp; user_id &amp; &quot;;Password=&quot; &amp; user_password &amp; &quot;;&quot;
End If

src_cx = cx &amp; &quot;Data Source=&quot; &amp; src_file &amp; &quot;;&quot;
tgt_cx = cx &amp; &quot;Data Source=&quot; &amp; tmp_file &amp; &quot;;&quot;

' run Jet Replication Objects to compact the database to a temporary file
Dim compacter As New JRO.JetEngine
compacter.CompactDatabase src_cx, tgt_cx
Set compacter = Nothing
    
' replace the old database with the compacted database, under the same name
Dim scode As Long
scode = MoveFileEx(tmp_file, src_file, MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING + MOVEFILE_COPY_ALLOWED)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Connecting to a JET database==

===Connecting from ADO===

When connecting to a database from ADO, one can connect using the JET OLE-DB provider or an ODBC DSN (Data Source Name). This section addresses using the OLE-DB provider, since that is the most efficient mechanism and allows greater capabilities than the ODBC DSN path.

Connections via the JET OLE-DB provider require information about the database to be passed in the OLE-DB connection string. If the database has a System database, or uses a database-level password, then this information must be provided in the connection string.

The following Visual Basic code demonstrates connecting to a JET database from ADO, using a username and password:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim cx As String
Dim db As ADODB.Connection

cx = &quot;Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=&quot; &amp; database_filename &amp; &quot;;&quot;
Set db = CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Connection&quot;)
db.Open cx, user_id, user_password
&lt;/source&gt;

The following Visual Basic code demonstrates connecting to a JET database from ADO, using a database-level password:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim cx As String
Dim db As ADODB.Connection

cx = &quot;Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=&quot; &amp; database_filename &amp; &quot;;&quot;
cx = cx &amp; &quot;Jet OLEDB:Database Password=&quot; &amp; database_password
Set db = CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Connection&quot;)
db.Open cx
&lt;/source&gt;

The following Visual Basic code demonstrates connecting to a JET database with System database from ADO, using a username and password:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim cx As String
Dim db As ADODB.Connection

cx = &quot;Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=&quot; &amp; database_filename &amp; &quot;;&quot;
cx = cx &amp; &quot;Jet OLEDB:System Database=&quot; &amp; system_db_filename &amp; &quot;;&quot;
Set db = CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Connection&quot;)
db.Open cx, user_id, user_password
&lt;/source&gt;

==DAO vs SQL==

JET engine versions up to JET 3.0 had limited support for database object creation using SQL statements, whilst full support was available via [[w:Data Access Objects|DAO]]. However, since JET 4.0, the JET SQL language allows support for most (if not all) database object attributes. Some design tools, however, have not been updated to reflect this and still use DAO (usually via ODBC) to make alterations to the database.

'''Bamboos''' are a group of woody perennial evergreen plants in the true grass family Poaceae, subfamily Bambusoideae, tribe Bambuseae. Some of its members are giants, forming by far the largest members of the grass family.
There are 91 genera and about 1,000 species of bamboo. They are found in diverse climates, from cold mountains to hot tropical regions. They occur from Northeast Asia (at 50°N latitude in Sakhalin), south throughout East Asia west to the Himalaya, and south to northern Australia. They also occur in sub-Saharan Africa, and in the Americas from the southeast of the USA south to Chile, there reaching their furthest south anywhere, at 47°S latitude. Major areas with no native bamboos include Europe, north Africa, western Asia, northern North America, most of Australia, and Antarctica.

Bamboo's long life makes it a Chinese symbol of longevity, while in India it is a symbol of friendship. However, the rarity of its blossoming has led to the flowers' being regarded as a sign of impending famine. This may be due to rats feeding upon the profusion of flowers, then multiplying and destroying a large part of the local food supply. The most recent flowering began in May, 2006 (see Mautam). Bamboo is said to bloom in this manner only about every 50 years (see 28-60 year examples in [http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/x5390e/x5390e05.htm 'gregarious' species table])

In Chinese culture, the bamboo (zhú 竹), plum blossom (méi 梅), orchid (lán 蘭), and chrysanthemum (jú 菊) (usually, méi lán zhú jú 梅蘭竹菊) are collectively referred to as the Four Noble Ones (四君子). These four plants also represent the four seasons and, in Confucian ideology, four aspects of the junzi (君子 &quot;prince&quot; or &quot;noble one&quot;). The pine tree (松), the bamboo, and the plum blossom (sōng zhú méi 松竹梅) are also admired for their perseverance under harsh conditions, and are together known as the &quot;Three Friends in Winter&quot; (歲寒三友).

In Japan, a bamboo forest sometimes surrounds a Shinto shrine as part of a sacred barrier against evil. Also, bamboo (také 竹) indicates something of the second rank, (as a sushi set or accommodations at a traditional Ryokan (inn)). This comes from the Chinese phrase 松竹梅 (in Japanese, sho-chiku-bai), where pine (matsu 松) is of the first rank, and plum (ume 梅) is of the third.

A Vietnamese proverb says: &quot;When the bamboo is old, the bamboo sprouts appear&quot;, the meaning being Vietnam will never be annihilated; if the previous generation dies, as the children take their place. Therefore the Vietnamese tradition will be maintained and developed eternally.

Several Asian cultures, including that of the Andaman Islands, believe that humanity emerged from a bamboo stem. In the Philippine creation myth, legend tells that the first man and the first woman were split open from a bamboo stem that emerged on an island created after the battle of the elemental forces(Sky and Ocean). In Malaysian legends a similar story includes a man who dreams of a beautiful woman while sleeping under a bamboo plant; he wakes up and breaks the bamboo stem, discovering the woman inside. The Japanese folktale &quot;Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot; (Taketori Monogatari) tells of a princess from the Moon emerging from a shining bamboo section. Hawaiian bamboo ('ohe) is a kinolau or body form of the Polynesian creator god Kane.

An ancient Vietnamese legend tells of a poor, young farmer who fell in love with his landlord's beautiful daughter. The farmer asked the landlord for his daughter's hand in marriage, but the proud landlord would not allow her to be bound in marriage to a poor farmer. The landlord decided to foil the marriage with an impossible deal; the farmer must bring him a &quot;bamboo tree of one-hundred sections&quot;. The benevolent god Bụt appeared to the farmer and told him that such a tree could be made from one-hundred sections from several different trees. Bụt gave to him four magic words to attach the many sections of bamboo: &quot;Khắc nhập, khắc xuất&quot;, which means &quot;put in immediately, take out immediately&quot;. The triumphant farmer returned to the landlord and demanded his daughter. The story ends with the happy marriage of the farmer and the landlord's daughter.

==Description==
The stems, or 'culms', can range in height from a few centimetres to 40 metres, with stem diameters ranging from 1 mm to 30 cm. The stems are jointed, with regular nodes; each node bears one side bud (three in Chusquea). These buds do not necessarily develop (especially in lower portions of the culm of tall bamboos) but are present. Buds that do develop ramify quickly with very short basal internodes into a cluster of several shoots, which usually develop into branches and occasionally into adventitious rhizomes. Branchlets form from the branches, and leaves grow off the branchlets. They are thus, unlike most other grasses, extensively branched; in large-growing species a single stem may carry many thousands of branchlets.

Although bamboo is a grass, many of the larger bamboos are very tree-like in appearance and they are sometimes called &quot;bamboo trees&quot;. The reason bamboos are so different from trees is they lack a vascular cambium layer and meristem cells at the top of the culm. The vascular cambium is the perpetually growing layer of a tree's trunk beneath the bark that makes it increase in diameter each year. The meristems make the tree grow taller.

A single culm (stem) of bamboo from an established rhizome (root) system reaches full height in one growing season, but then persists for several years, gradually increasing the number of side branches and branchlets, but growing neither broader nor taller.

Some species of bamboo rarely flower, some of them only every 28–120 years&lt;ref&gt;Troup 1921 [http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/x5390e/x5390e05.htm  synchronous 'gregarious' flowering species table]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1992/2/bamboo.cfm  3-120 years ref.]&lt;/ref&gt;.Some of these species are monocarpic, the plant dying after the seed matures. Furthermore, all the individuals of the species flower at the same time in a large geographical region. This trait is thought to have evolved because it reduces the effect of predators of the seed, since they are less likely to be able to wipe out the seed production, and cannot depend on bamboo as a food supply between flowerings.

Established bamboo will send up shoots that generally grow to their full height in a single season, making it the fastest growing woody plant. Several subtropical bamboo species can grow 30 cm (1 foot) per day, with some species having been documented as growing over 100 cm in one day. For the species most widely cultivated in gardens, 3–5 cm per day is more typical. A newly transplanted bamboo plant can take 1–2 years before it sends up new shoots (culms) and will have many seasons of &quot;sizing up&quot; before new shoots achieve the maximum potential height for that species.

Many bamboos are popular in cultivation as garden plants. In cultivation, care needs to be taken of their potential for invasive behaviour. They spread mainly through their roots and/or rhizomes, which can spread widely underground and send off new culms to break through the surface. There are two patterns for the spreading of bamboo, &quot;clumping&quot; (monopodial) and &quot;running&quot; (sympodial). Clumping bamboo species tend to spread underground slowly. Swimming bamboo species are highly variable in their tendency to spread; this is related to both the species and the soil and climate conditions. Some can send out runners several metres a year, while others can stay in the same general area for long periods. If neglected, they can be invasive over time and can cause problems by moving into adjacent areas. The reputation of bamboo as being highly invasive is often exaggerated, and situations where it has taken over large areas is often the result of years of untended or neglected plantings.

Once established as a grove, it is difficult to completely remove bamboo without digging up the entire network of underground rhizomes. If bamboo must be removed, an alternative to digging it up is to cut down the culms, and then repeatedly mow down new shoots as they arise, until the root system exhausts its energy supply and dies. If any leaves are allowed to photosynthesize the bamboo survives and will keep spreading.

There are two main ways to prevent the spread of running bamboo into adjacent areas. The first method is rhizome pruning or &quot;edging&quot;, which involves removing any rhizomes escaping the desired bamboo area. Hooks, shovels and picks are usual tools. The rhizomes are generally very close to the surface(just under a sod layer), so, if rhizome pruning is done twice a year, it will sever most, if not all, of the new growth. Some species may be deep running (beyond typical spade depth). These are much harder to control and deeper cuts will need to be made. Regular maintenance will indicate major growth directions and locations. Once the rhizomes are cut they should be removed. If any bamboo shoots come up outside of the bamboo area afterwards their presence indicates the precise location of the missed rhizome. The fibrous roots that radiate from the rhizomes do not grow up to be more bamboo so they stay in the ground.

The second way is by surrounding it with a physical barrier. Concrete and specially rolled HDPE plastic are usual materials. This is placed in a 60-90 cm (2-3 feet) deep ditch around the planting, and angled out at the top to direct the rhizomes to the surface. Strong rhizomes and tools can penetrate plastic barriers with relative ease, so great care must be taken. Bamboo in barriers is much more difficult to remove than free-spreading bamboo. Barriers and edging are unnecessary for clump forming bamboos. Clump forming bamboos may eventually need to have portions taken out if they get too large.

==Uses==

The shoots (new bamboo culms that come out of the ground) of bamboo, called zhú sǔn (simplified: 竹笋; traditional: 竹筍) or simply sǔn in Chinese, are edible. They are used in Asian stir fry, and are available in supermarkets in various sliced forms. Bamboo shoot tips are called zhú sǔn jiān (竹笋尖) or zhú jiān (笋尖).

In Indonesia they are sliced thinly and then boiled with santan (thick coconut milk) and spices to make a dish named gulai rebung. Other recipes using bamboo shoots are : sayur lodeh (mixed vegetables in coconut milk) and lun pia (sometimes written lumpia; fried wrapped bamboo shoots with vegetables). Note that the shoots of some species contain toxins that need to be leached or boiled out before they can be eaten safely.

Pickled bamboo, used as a condiment, may also be made from the pith of the young shoots.
The sap of young stalks tapped during the rainy season may be fermented to make ulanzi (a sweet wine), or simply made into a soft drink. Zhúyèqīng jiǔ (竹葉青酒) is a green-coloured Chinese liquor that has bamboo leaves as one of its ingredients.

Bamboo leaves are also used as wrappers for zongzi, a steamed dumpling typical of southern China, which usually contains glutinous rice and other ingredients.

When treated, bamboo forms a very hard wood which is both light and exceptionally tough. In tropical climates it is used in elements of house construction, as well as for fences, bridges, toilets, walking sticks, canoes, drinkware, furniture, chopsticks, food steamers, toys, construction scaffolding, as a substitute for steel reinforcing rods in concrete construction, hats, martial arts weaponry, abaci and various musical instruments such as the dizi, xiao, shakuhachi, palendag, jinghu, and angklung. The Bamboo Organ of Las Pinas, Philippines has pipes made of bamboo culms. When bamboo is harvested for wood, care is needed to select mature stems that are several years old, as first-year stems, although full size, are not fully woody and are not strong.

Bamboo is also widely carved for decorative artwork. Modern companies are attempting to popularize bamboo flooring made of bamboo pieces steamed, flattened, glued together, finished, and cut. However, bamboo wood is easily infested by wood-boring insects unless treated with wood preservatives or kept very dry (see carving, right).

Bamboo canes are normally round in cross-section, but square canes can be produced by forcing the new young culms to grow through a tube of square cross-section slightly smaller than the culm's natural diameter, thereby constricting the growth to the shape of the tube. Every few days the tube is removed and replaced higher up the fast-growing culm.

The fibre of bamboo has been used to make paper in China since early times. A high quality hand-made paper is still produced in small quantities. Coarse bamboo paper is still used to make spirit money in many Chinese communities.

The wood is used for knitting needles and the fibre can be used for yarn and fabrics. Bamboo fabric is notable for its soft feel and natural antibacterial propertiesTemplate:Cn. Clothing made from bamboo fibre is popular for activities such as yoga. Bed sheets and towels made from bamboo have become luxury items. Sharpened bamboo is also traditionally used to tattoo in Japan, Hawaii and elsewhere.

Bamboo is also used as a shank extension on smoking pipes. Often a bamboo shank is added as a repair when a shank is cracked with use or to repair a flaw during manufacture.

A variety of bamboo was one of about two dozen plants carried by Polynesian voyagers to provide all their needs settling new islands; in the Hawaiian Islands, among many uses, 'Ohe (bamboo) carried water, made irrigation troughs for taro terraces, was used as a traditional knife for cutting the umbilical cord of a newborn, as a stamp for dyeing bark tapa cloth, and for four hula instruments — nose flute, rattle, stamping pipes and Jew's harp.

Some skateboard &amp; snowboard deck manufacturers are beginning to use bamboo construction. It is both lighter and stronger than traditional materials and its cultivation is environmentally friendly.
Bamboo is also used to make enclosures in fish farming, where cages can be made from a wooden frame and bamboo lattices.

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==

&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;
bamboo can be propagated vegetatively by, root divisions, single node cuttings and air layering. there has been some success with tissue culture. diging up a section of a clump and severing one mother culm with new risome pup attached assures  a high success rate. this is labor intensive.

==Harvest==
===Shoots===
Bamboo shoots are harvested in a similar manner to [[../Asparagus/]], cut just where they ome off the underground stem (stolon). 

===Culms===
Bamboo culms are suitable for structural use after they are at least one year old, strengthening with each passing year.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Shell Basics =

From the moment you connect to an ssh session or log in to a text console or open an terminal from a graphical environment you are interacting with a shell program.  To describe it simply, the shell provides your command line.  It receives the commands you type and runs programs as needed to service those commands.

Bash, the most popular shell for GNU/Linux systems, is built on ideas going back to the original UNIX shell, the [[w:Bourne_shell|Borne Shell]].  While the Borne shell was revolutionary for its day, it is rather clunky by today's standards.  Concepts like command line editing, command history and job control evolved later in other shells that sought to replace the original Borne shell such as the [[w:C_shell|C shell]] and the [[w:Korn_shell|Korn Shell]].  While these features greatly enhanced shell usability, they also came at the price of breaking compatibility with Borne shell syntax.  When the GNU Project designed their shell they chose to implement these new ideas but still maintain compatibility with the original Borne shell.  The called their shell the Borne Again Shell, or simply [[w:Bash|Bash]].

The basic ideas for the shell differ little from the original, but command history, commandline editing, and features used in shell scripts are more idiosyncratic.

== Running commands from the shell ==

Commands at the shell take a basic form of:

 COMMAND [-OPTIONS]... [ARG]...

(It is common convention to put variables in capitols and square brackets around optional elements.  The ellipsis indicates the preceding can be repeated).

The COMMAND can be one of four things:

* A Program - The shell will search your PATH environment variable for programs named COMMAND.  Most programs are in /bin or /usr/bin.  Documentation for commands are usually found in manual pages (Accessed with `man COMMAND')

* A Shell Built-in - Built-in commands are commands processed directly by the shell such as cd, echo and alias.  Documentation for built-ins can be found in the manual page for bash or with the help built-in: `help COMMAND'.

* An alias - Aliases are processed before the command is run and are replaced by another command, possibly adding options or arguments.

* A Function - Functions call a sequence of commands and are more often used in shell scripting than on a typical command line.

=== Example Built-in Commands ===

Some of the simplest commands are Built-ins.  '''echo''' for example simply prints the arguments passed to it:

 [jtk@athena ~]$ echo Hello, World!
 Hello, World!

The '''pwd''' built-in prints the working directory; '''cd''' changes the working directory.  (We'll define &quot;working directory&quot; later when we discuss filesystem basics).

 [jtk@athena ~]$ '''pwd'''
 /home/jtk
 [jtk@athena ~]$ '''cd /usr/share/doc/bash-3.1/'''
 [jtk@athena bash-3.1]$ '''pwd'''
 /usr/share/doc/bash-3.1
 [jtk@athena bash-3.1]$ '''cd'''
 [jtk@athena ~]$ '''pwd'''
 /home/jtk

The '''help''' built-in provides documentation on built-ins.  Without arguments it gives a list of built-ins.  With Arguments, help can provide details on a particular built-in command:

 [jtk@athena ~]$ '''help'''
 GNU bash, version 3.1.7(1)-release (i386-redhat-linux-gnu)
 These shell commands are defined internally.  Type `help' to see this list.
 Type `help name' to find out more about the function `name'.
 Use `info bash' to find out more about the shell in general.
 Use `man -k' or `info' to find out more about commands not in this list.
 
 A star (*) next to a name means that the command is disabled.

 [jtk@athena ~]$ '''help help'''
 help: help [-s] [pattern ...]
      Display helpful information about builtin commands.  If PATTERN is
     specified, gives detailed help on all commands matching PATTERN,
     otherwise a list of the builtins is printed.  The -s option
     restricts the output for each builtin command matching PATTERN to
     a short usage synopsis.
 [jtk@athena ~]$ '''help cd'''
 cd: cd [-L|-P] [dir]
      Change the current directory to DIR.  The variable $HOME is the
     default DIR.  The variable CDPATH defines the search path for
     the directory containing DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH
     are separated by a colon (:).  A null directory name is the same as
     the current directory, i.e. `.'.  If DIR begins with a slash (/),
     then CDPATH is not used.  If the directory is not found, and the
     shell option `cdable_vars' is set, then try the word as a variable
     name.  If that variable has a value, then cd to the value of that
     variable.  The -P option says to use the physical directory structure
     instead of following symbolic links; the -L option forces symbolic links

=== Example Program Commands ===

Most commands you'll use are programs.  That is, they are a separate program run in a separate process from the bash shell.  These programs can be found in a number of locations on the system. The directories searched are specified in the PATH environment variable, but more on that later. Most programs are found in either the /bin or /usr/bin directories and we'll focus on those for now.

If I want to get a listing of files in a directory I would use the '''ls''' command.  The actual program that runs when you type &quot;ls&quot; is found at /bin/ls.  If called without arguments, '''ls''' will give a listing of files in the current directory.  An argument can be used to tell it which directory to list.  Options can be used to tell it how to list the files:

 [jtk@athena ~]$ '''ls'''
 bin   Desktop   google-earth  svn
 [jtk@athena ~]$ '''ls -l'''
 drwxrwxr-x 2 jtk jtk      4096 Dec  1 12:32 bin
 drwxr-xr-x 8 jtk jtk      4096 Jan 11 13:51 Desktop
 drwxr-xr-x 9 jtk jtk      4096 Dec 17 22:21 google-earth
 -rw-r--r-- 1 jtk jtk  16791707 Dec  5 16:43 livejournal.tar.bz2
 drwxrwxr-x 2 jtk jtk      4096 Dec  8 13:23 svn
 [jtk@athena ~]$ '''ls -lt'''
 drwxrwxr-x 2 jtk jtk      4096 Dec  1 12:32 bin
 -rw-r--r-- 1 jtk jtk  16791707 Dec  5 16:43 livejournal.tar.bz2
 drwxrwxr-x 2 jtk jtk      4096 Dec  8 13:23 svn
 drwxr-xr-x 9 jtk jtk      4096 Dec 17 22:21 google-earth
 drwxr-xr-x 8 jtk jtk      4096 Jan 11 13:51 Desktop
 [jtk@athena ~]$ '''ls /home/'''
 db2inst1  jtk  lost+found
 [jtk@athena ~]$ '''ls -l /home/'''
 total 24
 drwxr-xr-x  7 db2inst1 db2iadm1  4096 Jul 17  2006 db2inst1
 drwx------ 11 jtk      jtk       4096 Feb  2 11:47 jtk
 drwx------  2 root     root     16384 Apr 19  2006 lost+found

Notice the option string &quot;-lt&quot;.  The &quot;l&quot; specifies a &quot;long&quot; listing while the &quot;t&quot; specifies that the entries should be sorted by modification time.  These are single character options and could have been specified separately as &quot;-l -t&quot;, but they are usually grouped together like this.

It is customary to put options before arguments such as in the command &quot;ls -l /home&quot;.  With GNU utilities this is optional, but some utilities will complain if any options appear after the same argument.  (There is no distinction between option and argument to the shell or the operating system.  When the command is executed by the kernel, they are all arguments and it is up to the program to interpret them).

=== Example Running Command as Root User ===

If you are a user which is not root and you need to install or run a command which requires admin credentials then just do the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
[jtk@athena ~]$ su root
Enter root password
Run the command you want (as root).
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's that's easy.

If you are a user and want to list the IP address of the machine you can use sudo command, for now lets imagine you are allowed to use sudo command

&lt;pre&gt;
# sudo /sbin/ifconfig 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Similarly you can use sudo to run any superuser command

==Elevations==

After modeling, elevations are not yet presentable. Lines will appear between walls and floors, and grade lines may not appear at the elevations. There are other ways to resolve the appearance of elevations, but please consider the following suggestions:

* If you are using an exterior cladding, make sure your floor sketch lines are on the outside line of the cladding, not the core.
* Paint the edge of the floor with the same material as your exterior cladding and then join the floors to the walls. Do not join and then paint, as your lines won't disappear. (If you did this, you can sometimes work around it by joining the walls above and below the floor together, and hitting ok when it warns that the objects do not touch one another.)
* Elevations looks best with the silhouetting turned on. Go into advance model graphics, and override the silhouette lines to Wide Lines.
* If you don't like some of the lines silhouetting, you can override them with the linework tool and the &lt;not silhouette&gt; setting.
* Make sure your pad (which carves out a hole for your building in the terrain) is drawn to the outside of your cladding. This will ensure that a grade line appears on your elevations.

      <comment>/* List of key signatures */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''key signature''' of a piece of music is the '''sharps''' or '''flats''' listed after the '''[[Piano/Treble Clef and Bass Clef|clef]]'''. This is to avoid the repetiton of '''[[Piano/Accidentals|accidentals]]''' in the score. They are listed on every line of music, which signifies what key he/she has chosen.

There is a key signature for each '''major key''' (though '''C major''', which has no flats or sharps, is a 'blank'). Each major key, in turn, shares its signature with the '''minor key''' whose scale begins '''three semitones lower''' - in other words, on the 6th note (the '''submediant''') of the major scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= The X Window System =

The X window system or X11 is most basic component of the graphical environment.  You can find many implementations of X11 including servers for Max OSX and Windows (Please insert recommendations!).  Most GNU/Linux distributions now use [http://www.x.org/ X.Org]'s implementation (which forked not too long ago from the [http://www.xfree86.org/ XFree86] project).

== Starting X ==

=== Graphical Login and GDM ===
Most functions of your users graphical experience is actually '''not'''
handled by X, but rather by the Graphical login managers, such as the 
Gnome Display Manager(GDM).  While other display managers exist, Red Hat and
fedora based systems use the Gnome Display Manager as the login manager for
their systems.

=== The '''X''' command ===
In comparison to Graphical Managers such as GDM, &quot;X&quot; contains extremely
minimal functionality on its own, but each graphical display manager is
actually built atop X, and thus X is important to understand in its own
right.

The 'X' window system is:
* a client-server application
#The client is the application using the X-window
#The server controls the keyboard and screen and takes signals from the application and responds with output to display on the screen
* A protocol used by the application to connect to the server
**the 'X' protocol, also known as X11

To start X, one has

===Pittsburgh Filmmakers===
A great resource for filmmakers in western Pennsylvania is [http://pghfilmmakers.org Pittsburgh Filmmakers]. Filmmakers (as it is often referred to locally) offers for-credit classes through local colleges and universities such as Point Park University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Carnegie Mellon University as well as certificate programs and non-credit courses. They also have membership plans for filmmakers, photographers, and community members who are not taking classes. Filmmakers has an in-house equipment office, editing suites, darkrooms, two screening rooms, and a sound stage.

The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Dvx.jpg]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|rationale]] for a fair use claim is provided.

In order to upload fair use material, specific rationale must be provided as to why fair use media is necessary, and how there are no free alternatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h1&gt;Freeze during launch&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;
'''Added:''' --[[User:Loek van Kooten|Loek van Kooten]] 19:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)&lt;p&gt;
'''Version:''' 7.0.284&lt;p&gt;
'''System:''' Windows XP SP2&lt;p&gt;
'''Description:''' When launching DVX, the software sometimes gets stuck at the splash screen, mostly during the &quot;Initializing engine objects&quot; phase, but sometimes later. The running instance of DVX cannot be closed via Task Manager, and as long as said instance is running, no new instance of DVX can be started. The only way to end the running instance seems to be a restart of the system, which can take up to 10 minutes because Windows fails to timely close the running instance. &lt;p&gt;
'''Description:''' Same as above, but then after clicking the Help - About Deja Vu X option. &lt;p&gt;
'''Reproduction:''' This issue could be reproduced easily on at least two systems, both using USB dongles and a recent (as of 2007) ASUS motherboard. &lt;p&gt;
'''Workaround:''' When DVX freezes, disconnect the USB dongle. The launch should continue and DVX should start in demo mode. Close DVX, reconnect the dongle and try again.&lt;p&gt;

----

'''Status:'''&lt;p&gt;
Cannot be solved directly by Atril Software. Atril Software will need to contact third party dongle driver.

'''Description:''' DVX gets confused by number conversion issues in translations from Japanese and therefore copies numbers of auto-propagated strings straight away without actually checking whether the numbers in the auto-propagated 'copy' are equal to the numbers in the auto-propagated 'original'.&lt;p&gt;
Example: &lt;p&gt;
平成19年2月2日 (The year Heisei 19, 2nd month, 2nd day) ''is translated as'' February 2nd 2007&lt;p&gt;
平成19年1月1日 (The year Heisei 19, 1st month, 1st day) ''is auto-propagated as'' February 2nd 2007 (it should be January 1st 2007)&lt;p&gt;
While it is understandable that DVX cannot come up with the right translation for the auto-propagated copy, the danger lies in the fact that DVX marks the copy as auto-propagated while in fact the source text is different. Turning auto-propagation off is the other extreme, as that also cancels auto-propagation of strings that would otherwise be propagated correctly.&lt;p&gt;
Solution: DVX should not auto-propagate strings if a) the source text is Japanese AND b) numbers in the auto-propagated copy are not equal to numbers in the auto-propagated original.

&lt;h2&gt;4. Import from Microsoft Word&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
'''Added:''' --[[User:Loek van Kooten|Loek van Kooten]] 15:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC)&lt;p&gt;
'''Version:''' 7.0.284&lt;p&gt;
'''System:''' Windows XP SP2&lt;p&gt;
'''Description:''' After importing Japanese Word documents, the text in DVX is infested with rogue codes. Japanese often features both Chinese ideograms (&lt;i&gt;kanji&lt;/i&gt;) and the Roman alphabet/Arabic numerals. Since standard Roman alphabet/Arabic numerals in Japanese fonts are quite ugly, most Japanese texts in Word use two different fonts (one for kanji and one for the Roman alphabet/Arabic numerals), which are constantly alternated. Each alternation results in a rogue code. &lt;p&gt;
The problem is that if the target text is a western language, these rogue codes make no sense at all, as the target text will not feature kanji and is therefore written in one font (the font used for the Roman alphabet/Arabic numerals). I.e. these rogue codes are completely superfluous in the target text, slow down the translation process and pollute your databases. &lt;p&gt;
When translating from Japanese to a western language, DVX should therefore ignore all font changes and opt for a standard font instead (like Arial, or maybe even user-defined). Automatic recognition of the fonts used in the Japanese source text seems very complicated, as &quot;font sets&quot; (consisting of a Japanese and a Roman font) might be used and &quot;paired&quot; inconsistently.&lt;p&gt;
It seems many rogue codes are actually not caused by alternating fonts, but by alternating code sets, as even Word documents that have been forced to use one font give inconsistent rogue codes in DVX:&lt;p&gt;
{\loch\af25\hich\af25\dbch\af25 \loch\af25\hich\af25\dbch\f25 平成}{\loch\af25\hich\af25\dbch\af25 \hich\af25\dbch\af25\loch\f25 18年12月19日}&lt;p&gt;
instead of merely 平成18年12月19日&lt;p&gt;
The rogue codes are inconsistent: if a code appears behind 平成 (Japanese changes from kanji to Arabic numerals), you'd expect a similar code behind 年, 月 or 日, but this is not the case.

'''Reported by:''' Unknown user.&lt;p&gt;
'''Version:''' Unknown&lt;p&gt;
'''System:''' Unknown&lt;p&gt;
'''Description:''' The USB dongle is not detected by Déjà Vu, even though it is plugged in the computer.&lt;p&gt; 
'''Reproduction:''' Can the issue be reproduced? Can it be reproduced on different systems? This is very important to establish a pattern. &lt;p&gt;
'''Workaround:''' &lt;p&gt;

#Disconnect your dongle. 
#Click on the menu option Start-&gt;Run, and in the ensuing textbox type: ''&quot;C:\Program Files\ATRIL\Deja Vu X\Dongle\setupdrv.exe&quot; /u'' +
#Reboot.
#Download the dongle driver installer from [http://www.atril.com/dvx/dongledrivers.zip here].
#Extract the installer, and copy it to this folder: ''&quot;C:\Program Files\ATRIL\Deja Vu X\Dongle\&quot;'' +
#Install the drivers. To do so, open Start menu, click on Run and enter and execute the following line for USB dongle:
##''&quot;C:\Program Files\ATRIL\Deja Vu X\Dongle\setupdrv.exe&quot;'' +
##Or this line for a parallel port dongle: ''&quot;C:\Program Files\ATRIL\Deja Vu X\Dongle\setupdrv.exe&quot; /par'' +
#Reboot again. 
#Connect your dongle. 
#The New Hardware Wizard will appear as soon as Windows detects the dongle. Follow it instructions, and, when this is done, the dongle drivers will be installed.

&lt;p&gt;
+ In the case of DV3, the path to the installer will be &quot;C:\Program Files\DejaVu\Setupdrv.exe&quot;.
&lt;p&gt;
If Déjà Vu continues to run in demo mode, run ddlook.exe (located in your Déjà Vu folder) and send to support@atril.com what this program reports, including any extended error messages.

----

'''Status:'''&lt;p&gt;
Cannot be solved directly by Atril Software. Atril Software will need to contact third party dongle driver.

Engine patches:&lt;br&gt;
http://www.atril.com/dvx/builds/284/dvxEngine.zip
http://www.atril.com/dvx/builds/284/dvxEngine.2.zip
http://www.atril.com/dvx/builds/284/dvxEngine.3.zip

http://www.atril.com/dvx/builds/284/dvxEngine.7.zip
http://www.atril.com/dvx/builds/284/dvxEngine.8.zip

The zip files contain a replacement dvxengine.dll file. Install it by locating the file (usually found in the folder &quot;C:\Program Files\ATRIL\Deja Vu X&quot;) and overwriting it with the one in the downloaded zip file. You may want to save a backup copy of the old .dll.

Patches from 3 and upwards reportedly address specific problems and were not
meant for public use. There is no official information about what problems they address.

Patch 2 should reportedly solve or alleviate certain assembly problems. It's
not perfect, but seems to improve things. If you have empty squares and (blue underlined) multiple choice problems, this patch might help.

Patch 3 &lt;i&gt;appears&lt;/i&gt; to resolve at least a TDB assembly problem, like &quot;sin embargo&quot; = &quot;however&quot; being assembled as &quot;without embargo&quot; (sin = without), despite the right term being present in TDB (single-word terms and multiple-word terms).

Patch 4 reportedly solves an AutoSearch/assembly problem with strings containing square brackets, where strings in DB containing square brackets aren't found/used.

Patch 7 reportedly includes the AutoSearch/assembly problem with strings containing square brackets solved in Patch 4, and fixes to problems with RTF/DOC export of highlighted text. Other fixes it includes relate to very specific problems with SGML and RTF.

Patch 8 includes the previous fixes, and has additional fixes for the SGML filter, but may be less well tested than Patch 7.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==(Brown &amp; Kulik, 1977)==
Where were you on September 11th? Every so-often, an event occurs that stays in the public conscience as an almost photographic memory for the rest of people's lives; JFK's assassination, Princess Diana's car crash, and many more, and we are able to recall unprecedented details about the events.

Brown &amp; Kulik (1977) described such memories as flashbulb memories, and coined the expression &quot;Now Print!&quot; as the process by which such memories seem to be effortlessly created, The key characteristics of flashbulb memories are:

* Vivid
* Significant amount of detail
* Long lasting (a person may be able to recall a flashbulb memory for the rest of their lives)
* Often of emotional significance in the person's life; Robinson (1980) used cues with participants in a study and found that the recall rates for emotional word cues were faster than those for non-emotional words, which would suggest that emotion has a role in memory.
flashbulb memory is memories

==What affects flashbulb memories?==
The relevance or emotional significance of an event to a person's life would seem to increase its likelihood of being stored as a 'flashbulb memory'. Brown and Kulik found that 75% of black people asked were able to recall the assassination of Martin Luther King, while just 33% of white people asked could do the same.

      <comment>/* Client Variables */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Variables are used extensively in Coldfusion.

==CFSET==
The basic way to set a variable is to use cfset.  There is no difference between setting a variable as a string or a number.  Strings must be inclosed by an opening and closing ' or &quot;.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset tempnum = 5&gt;
&lt;cfset tempstr = &quot;Hello&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==CFOUTPUT and Pound Signs==
The basic way to convert the variable name into its value is to place pound signs around the variable name.  The variable name and pound signs must be placed inside of a cfoutput tag.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset tempvar = 8&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#tempvar#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Additionally you can perform calculations within the pound signs.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#1+1#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Output: 2

==Evaluate()==
An advanced feature is to use the evaluate() function.  ColdFusion's evaluate function lets you evaluate a string expression at runtime.  
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset x = &quot;int(1+1)&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfset y = Evaluate(x)&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is particularly useful when you need to programatically choose the variable you want to read from.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset x = Evaluate(&quot;queryname.#columnname#[rownumber]&quot;)&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Since ColdFusion MX 6.1 it has been highly recommended that developers stay away from using Evaluate() for most common tasks. Instead it is recommended that developers use bracket notation.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset queryname[columnname][rownumber] /&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Since the entire variables system is based on a structure system, this design can be used on any type of variable.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset x = &quot;foo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#variables['x']#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Variable Lookup==
*Local variables
*CGI variables
*File variables
*URL variables
*Form variables
*Cookie variables
*Client variables

==Session Variables==
Session variables are easy to use and create.  A session variable is used to allow variables to live beyond the life of the page in which they are created in but will die when the users session dies.

On every page of your application where you are going to use the session variable you need to include:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfapplication sessionmanagement=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;  
This code should normally be placed in your Application.cfm file.

Then to set a session variable on page 1:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset session.name = &quot;Bob&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

And on a different page called after page 1:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#session.name#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Client Variables==
&lt;cfset tempvar = 8&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#tempvar#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;

==Application Variables==

==Server Variables==

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Basics of Two-Dimensional Art, often referred to as the Fundamentals or Foundations, can be defined as the &quot;Elements and Principles of Composition&quot;

== Composition (visual arts) ==

'''Composition''' is the plan, placement or arrangement of the elements of art in a work. The general goal is to select and organize appropriate elements within the work in order to communicate ideas and feelings with the viewer. 

The visual elements (the vocabulary with which the visual artist composes) are:
*Line--the literal element itself (see below) or a visual path that enables the eye to move within the piece
*Shape--areas defined by edges within the piece whether geometric or organic
*Value--the relative lightness or darkness of elements
*Texture--surface qualities which translate into tactile illusions
*Color--hues with their various values and intensities
*Direction--visual routes which take vertical, horizontal or diagonal paths
*Size--the relative dimensions and proportions of images or shapes to one another

The principles of composition within a picture are:

* The picture plane--or activated space within an artwork
* Symmetry or Asymmetry--creating static or dynamic compositions, respectively
* Flow--the pathway followed by the viewer's eye when they view the image
* Spatial illusion--invoking a sense of space or perspective
* Dominance Structures--systems of hierarchy that promote flow, spatial illusion, and impact
* Areas of Focus--concentrated groups of line, shape, detail, or contrast


The artist determines what areas of focus of the art will be, and composes the work accordingly. The eyes of the viewer will then tend to linger over these points of focus. The illustration can be arranged in a harmonious whole that works together to produce a statement.

==Rule of Thirds==

{{main|Rule of thirds}}
The [[W:rule of thirds|rule of thirds]] (an application of the [[W:Golden ratio|Golden ratio]]) is a guideline commonly followed by visual artists.  The objective is to keep the subject(s) and areas of interest (such as the horizon) out of the center of the image, by placing them near one of the lines that would divide the image into three equal columns and rows, ideally near the intersection of those lines.

[[Image:Rule_of_thirds_photo.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Rule of thirds: Note how the horizon falls close to the bottom grid line, and how the dark areas are in the left third, the overexposed in the right third.]]

==Simplification==
Images with a clutter can distract from the main focus points within the picture and make it difficult to identify the subject.  By decreasing the extraneous content, the viewer is more likely to focus on the primary objects. Clutter can also be reduced through the use of lighting, as the brighter areas of the image tend to draw the eye, as do lines and squares.

[[Image:Blue Chest.png|thumb|400px|center|Detail is used to develop a distinct focal point.]]

===Limiting focus===
One approach to achieving simplification within a photograph is to use a wide aperture when shooting to limit the [[W:depth of field|depth of field]].  When used properly in the right setting, this technique can place everything that is not the subject of the photograph to be out of focus.

[[Image:Jonquil flowers at f5.jpg|center|400px|thumb|The blurred background focuses the eye on the flowers.]]

A similar approach, given the right equipment, is to take advantage of the [[W:Scheimpflug principle|Scheimpflug principle]] to change the plane of focus.

===Field of view===
By altering the position of the camera, the background can be changed so that the subject has fewer distractions to compete with.  This could be achieved by getting closer, moving laterally, or moving the camera vertically. This is true in most common places and is the final test and the you must do this in order to pass the photographers law of photograpy.

==Symmetry==

The &quot;rule of odds&quot; suggests that an odd number of subjects in an image is more interesting than an even number. Thus if you have more than one subject in your picture, the suggestion is to choose an arrangement with at least three subjects. An even number of subjects produces symmetries in the image, which can appear less natural.

Related to the rule of odds is the observation that triangles are an aesthetically pleasing implied shape within an image.

==Viewpoint==
The position of the camera can strongly influence the aesthetics of an image.  Not only does it influence the background as described above, but it also influences the viewer's interpretation of the subject.

For example, if a boy is photographed from above, for example from the eye level of an adult, he is diminished in stature.  A photograph taken at the child's level would treat him as an equal, and one taken from below could result in an impression of dominance.

An image can be rendered more dramatic when it fills the frame. People can have a tendency to perceive things as larger than they actually are, and filling the frame fulfills this psychological mechanism. This can be used to eliminate distractions from the background.

==Lines==

Every photograph contains lines. Both physical lines and continuous, less obvious lines exist. The brain often unconsciously reads near continuous lines between different elements and subjects at varying distances. Strong flowing lines can be created without a photographer even realizing it. Movement is also a source of line, blur can also create a reaction. Subject lines which create an illusion, contribute to both mood and by means of [[W:linear perspective|linear perspective]] give the illusion of depth of field. Oblique and angular lines give us the sense of dynamic balance and a sense of action. Lines can also direct attention towards the main subject of the photograph, or contribute to the photographs organization by dividing it into compartments.  

===Straight Lines===

Horizontal, Vertical, and Angled lines all contribute to creating different moods of a photograph. The angle and the relationship to the size of the frame both work to determine the influence the line has on the image. They are also strongly influenced by tone, color, and repetition in relation to the rest of the photograph. Straight, horizontal lines, commonly found in landscape photography, gives the impression of calm, tranquility, and space. An image filled with strong vertical lines tends to have the impression of height, and grandeur. Tightly angled convergent lines give a dynamic, lively, and active effect to the image. Viewpoint is very important when dealing with lines in photography, because every different perspective elicits a different response to the photograph. Too many lines without a clear subject point suggest chaos in the image and may conflict with the mood the photographer is trying to evoke.

===Curved Lines===

Curved lines are generally used to create a sense of flow within a photograph. The eye generally scans these lines with ease and enjoyment as it follows it throughout the image. Compared to straight lines, curves provide a greater dynamic influence in a photograph. When paired with soft-directional lighting curved lines can give gradated shadows which usually results in a very harmonious line structure within the image. Perspective is also important with curved lines, generally speaking the higher the viewpoint the more open the lines tend to be.

* Option for displaying duplicate TDB entries in the PF window (Herbert Eppel, 20 Nov 06)
* Option to sort Autosearch -- Portions alphabetically, and to add one or more words that, if any of them occurs as the first word of a multi-word term, they would be ignored (e.g., der, die, das, the, a, an, la, and le). (??)
* Multiple ASP entries can be selected but not deleted (only the last entry of the selection is deleted) - please enable multiple deletion (Herbert Eppel, 10 July 07)
* When an ASP entry is deleted the cursor jumps back to entry no. 1. It would be much preferable for the cursor to jump to the next entry (Herbert Eppel, 10 July 07)

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Being able to manually assign a degree of preference to TDB entries for Assembling (Tanja Güllicher)

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reinstate DV3 option to discard portions&lt;/b&gt; less than two words long, three words long, etc. from Assemble and AutoSearch box (user definable) (David Turner)

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Insert an exact match or best fuzzy match&lt;/b&gt; on control/alt+down as a default option even if AutoAssemble is turned off (David Turner)

&lt;li&gt; Assemble option to use &lt;b&gt;only lexicon and/or term base entries&lt;/b&gt; (disabling use of memory portions for AA) (David Turner)

&lt;li&gt; Propagate exact matches &lt;b&gt;exactly&lt;/b&gt; without trying to adjust new target to match source punctuation (David Turner)

&lt;li&gt; Consider a propagation with a number change as a fuzzy propagation rather than an exact propagation, by just changing the number and not trying to readjust the target to match the source punctuation (if n°1 = No. 1, n°2 should be propagated as No. 2 and not No2 as currently the case (David Turner)

&lt;li&gt; Yes, agree to David: don't try to match source punctation &lt;b&gt;if you cannot handle it&lt;/b&gt; anyway; this is really annoying!! If DV &lt;b&gt;does&lt;/b&gt; want to handle source punctuation, it should be able to know the differences: e.g. it does have a rule that English floating point numbers such as &quot;4.3&quot; should be &quot;4,3&quot; in German, which makes sense most of the time. Then why not give it &lt;b&gt;rules on other types of punctation&lt;/b&gt;? Like, English &lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt; (opening double quote) should be &lt;b&gt;„&lt;/b&gt; in German, and &lt;b&gt;”&lt;/b&gt; (closing qu.) should be &lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt;, in turn? Could even be made user-definable (per language). (Florian v. Savigny)

&lt;li&gt; Propagation is of limited use (and the difference of this feature to simple matching is not impressive) if you go on to modify the &quot;mother segment&quot; after propagation has taken place. &lt;em&gt;Exact&lt;/em&gt; propagation &lt;b&gt;would&lt;/b&gt; be a &lt;b&gt;real feature&lt;/b&gt; if the &quot;child segments&quot; (i.e. the ones where the content was propagated) were simply &lt;b&gt;mirroring&lt;/b&gt; the &quot;mother segment&quot;, i.e. whatever happens in the mother segment happens in all &quot;child segments&quot; simultaneously. Also, one would need navigation for jumping from the &quot;child segments&quot; to their &quot;mother segment&quot; (and back, as in a browser). Or, alternatively, whatever happens in &lt;b&gt;any&lt;/b&gt; of a group of identical cells (including the &quot;mother&quot; and all &quot;children&quot;) happens in all others simultaneously. It is a behaviour I usually try to emulate manually using Filter for Selection (but this is certainly more error-prone). (Florian v. Savigny)


&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fuzzy propagation should not exist&lt;/b&gt;, except perhaps in the sense David has suggested above, when only numbers and/or codes differ (though I'm actually unsure of whether it should be called &quot;fuzzy&quot; then). Fuzzy propagation has no advantage over plain vanilla fuzzy matching; rather, it is more confusing and error-prone (plain vanilla matching – and editing – happens during normal editing, i.e. going through the text in reading order, while propagation means jumping unknown distances and &quot;rushing by&quot;). At the very least, it should be possible to disable fuzzy propagation. Or, at the very very least, you shouldn't lose focus when you cancel it. (Florian v. Savigny)

* An option to flag consecutive identical words (e.g. &quot;press Open to open the the menu&quot;). The spelling checker will report &quot;doubled words&quot; (Tools - Spelling - Options) but it would be nice if this option were also integrated into the AutoCheck on CTRL/ALT+down feature (Tools - Options - General - Terminology Checks -- The latter ought to be renamed to a more general indication e.g. Auto-Check/Auto-Verification).

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Search &amp; Replace should end up where it started and give the total number of replacements (Martin Wunderlich)
* Search and Replace should have the option &quot;Update Translation Memory accordingly&quot; . (Georgy Moiseenko)
* When performing a Replace all, indicate how many replacements were done (useful to count how many times a word is used), as in Word and keep the cursor in the original segment, rahter than the last updated segment (Walter Weyne)
* And should not loose focus when complete (Jenny Zonneveld)
* Should (as a second alternative to the &quot;Match case&quot; option) be able to handle case &quot;intelligently&quot;, as in GNU Emacs (and Word?): if the replaced word (the match found) is uppercase, the replacement should be uppercase, too. If the replaced word is lowercase, the replacement should be lowercase. (Florian v. Savigny) (And yes - S&amp;R's losing focus is very annoying, I fully agree!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Option to use only entries from settable client and subject (levels) for assembly, pretranslation and autosearch actions. (Gudmund Areskoug)
* Compound term handling, allowing for terms of the form &quot;source1a ... source1b&quot; &gt; &quot;target1a ... target1b&quot; to be sent to TDB and assembled. (Gudmund Areskoug)
* Not oblige us to have only one main lemma when adding terminology, so that, for example, an English, Spanish, French glossary imported into DVX will work for translating in all directions. (Timothy Barton)
* Two column view, like in DV3, only with the option to select language domains for the columns, to see e. g. all EN, EN-US or EN-GB in source and all DE, DE-DE or DE-CH in target. (Gudmund Areskoug)

Hi. I noticed that you uploaded [[:Image:Teacher yr.gif]] as &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}} on the premise that &quot;This cartoon was taken from a free education site. No restrictions apply.&quot; Please note that, as per [[Wikibooks:Image use policy]], a source (in this case, a link to the website where the image was found) is necessary to verify copyright status. Also note that unless someone explicitly releases an original work into the public domain, terms such as &quot;No restrictions apply&quot; or &quot;No rights reserved&quot; indicate that the author of the work has retained copyright but allows the image to be used for any purpose, which I think is technically different than releasing a work into the public domain. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:16, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nearly all vertebrate fossils are represented by the bones of the deceased specimen. These can be in the form of partial or complete skeletal remains, but for many species individual bones are all that has been found. This partial evidence of a species may lead to disputes as to its classification and many are classed as [[/Nomen dubium/]], indicaring that their relationship with other species is not known. Sometimes direct impressions such as skin, feathers or scales are left behind, usually because the sediment is fine and the fossil hasn't undergone any major changes such as compression. Other times trace fossils are left, in the  form of coprolite (feces), footprints, burrows and the like.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Tofu|Tofu]]

== Ingredients ==
*Spices:
**6-8 whole [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom pods]]
**2 tsp whole [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seeds]]
**½ tsp whole [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
**1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
*4 Tbsp [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*1 (or 2) [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves, chopped
*1 (or  2) large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped coarsely
*1 [[Cookbook:Tofu|Tofu cake]] –extra firm (or firm), cut into ¾-inch cubes.
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Currant|currants]]
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]
*½ cup creamy plain [[Cookbook:yogurt|yogurt]] – 2% (fat?) is good
*1 Tbsp [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (optional)
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Coconut milk|coconut milk]] (optional)
*¼ cup (or more) [[Cookbook:Almond|slivered almonds]], lightly toasted
*⅛ cup toasted [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]] threads or flakes (optional)

==Procedure==
# Crack open the cardamom pods. Reserve the seeds; discard the shells.
# Heat oil to quite hot (not smoking.)
# Add spices and bay leaf.
# Cook until seeds crack. (1-2 minutes.)
# Reduce heat to medium.
# Add onion and garlic. Cook until tender &amp; translucent
# Reserve onion, garlic &amp; spices to a side dish
# Season tofu with salt &amp; pepper. Then fry. (Adding oil if needed.)
# When tofu is heated through, [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] until lightly brown (5-8 minutes).
# Add reserved onion/spice mixture.
# Add currants and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] for 3-5 minutes.
#* At this point, tofu may be cooled &amp; chilled for re-heating the following day, up to a week.
#* The spices continue to blend their flavors &amp;ndash; this dish re-heated tastes as well as, or better than, when freshly cooked!
# Add sour cream, yogurt and, if using: coconut milk &amp; butter.
# Simmer until sauce has cooked down a little.
# Add toasted almonds (and toasted coconut, if using.)

Serve hot with [[Cookbook:Saffron Sweet Rice|Saffron Sweet Rice]].

OK - I will!

== Clever! ==
If you put something on your talk page, no RC patroller can see you haven't been &quot;welcomed&quot;.  So I really hope you don't mind someone who has been around here far less time that you saying '''&quot;Welcome&quot;'''.  However the real reason for this was to say what a great lot of work you've done on Wikijunior - I get to see it on RC.  Each time I look at pages there I think more Wikibookians could benefit from looking at how good pages should be.  A pet of mine is getting alpha cat'ing right so I have done some work on Wikijunior pages in that respect and intend to do more when I get time - if I can help let me know.  The proposed logo looks very good too - I've comment on the page about that.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:04, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

== Alpha Cat's on Wikijunior ==

Hi - just run thro a few more pages.  It really is quite good for the boring search and replace type stuff so let me know if I can help at all.  Equally if I do make mistakes please point them out - that way I learn - thanks and regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:31, 29 November 2006 (UTC)


== My RfA ==
I just wanted to say thanks for your support.  It did mean quite a bit to me to have one or two people other than admins support me.  If I can be of any assistance to you I will be happy to try and help (&amp; I assure you I will do all I can to preserve the quality of the Wikijunior pages!).  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:48, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== Unstructured Wikijunior stubs ==

Further to my comment on the [[Medicine4kids]] page, I'd like to mention that you don't need to link to all Wikijunior pages from [[Wikijunior]] and Co. making them virtually invisible except when browsing. You could then clearly tag and categorize the Wikijunior stubs that don't have the right structure, or scope, or whatever.

Finally, I'd just like to make clear that I'm not rooting strongly for the page up for deletion. I have, however, recently seen users (unknowingly, I'm sure) disregarding policy. I've tried to put some effort into the policies and guidelines and think we need to start obeying these soon. I would be delighted to help you out setting something up for Wikijunior and make sure it fits well with current policy. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:41, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

== Please ==
I'd prefer it if you were to stick around some. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:01, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
:PS if you want to email me anytime you are welcome - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:59, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

== VfD ==

I saw your comment on the [[Medicine4kids]] VfD discussion. I'm sorry that you feel so dejected by it, you are a valuable member in many of the VfD discussions, and it would be bad for the project to lose you in that.

For what it is worth, I agree that this page should be deleted, and I have cast my vote accordingly. [[User:Swift]]'s objections not withstanding, the general community seems to agree that this page needs to be deleted. 

I hope you feel better about this, I know sometimes we all just need to take a break and blow off some steam. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:11, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Comment''' I'll not be spending any of my time working on this book. I do not currently have the energy or enthusiasm to write and shepherd any kind of Wikijunior policy. I will stay out of VfD's in the future. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 15:57, 7 December 2006 (UTC)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

: Dear Xixtas, I perfectly understand that you have limited time and energy to spend on volunteer based projects such as Wikibooks. The comment above does show a little bit of frustration (also sensed by Whiteknight). I hope don't take discussions personally and don't tire too much from constructive critisism. The VfD is, in my opinion, a place to unearth all arguments and deceide based on community consensus within the project policies and guidelines.
: If you choose that your time would be better spent than on VfDs, I wish you all the best, but would hate to thing that the atmosphere there was what put you off. Regards, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 20:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
:: Thank you all for your concern. I just want to use my time where I can be most productive and do the most good for Wikijunior. It seems that that is probably in the realm of developing actual books rather than in backend discussions about policies that I really don't understand the nuances of. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 17:07, 8 December 2006 (UTC) 

:::Believe me - getting folk to dance on the head of a pin is not my idea of fun either.  However loosing someone of your quality and experience would sadden me (yes you are on my watchlist!!).

::: Good to hear you are sticking around and directing your efforts to the work you enjoy the most &amp;mdash; certainly a good method to not wear yourself out. I hope you will keep at least an eye on the policy work that takes place. A special consideration with respect to Wikibooks is certainly an idea to keep in mind, but might not be something that will come up among the [[WB:PAG]] discussion regulars. Your experience and knowledge of the nuances of the Wikijunior project would be invaluable. If you ever see anything in policy that you think should be mended, I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider making a mention of it on the policy talk page (or mine, if you'd prefer) for later reference.
::: I got the impression from your VfD comment and your user page [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Xixtas&amp;diff=676362&amp;oldid=654787 edit] that you felt the community less than pleasing, and as I mentioned in my previous comment I'd hate that to be the case. Now, I may very well have completely misunderstood things (and I apologise if I have) but just in case, I'd like to urge you to feel free to take such issues to those you feel are misbehaving and give them a gentle nudge. Most people (including me) would be grateful for constructive critisism and happy to discuss how to improve the community interaction. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:43, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

====Re: VfD====

I want to note that I am not trying to suggest that any content be deleted that is being worked on and has a realistic chance of getting somewhere in terms of eventually becoming a book.  All I was trying to point out was that books that are eternal stubs of one paragraph (roughly) and don't seem to show continued support in the future might be eventual candidates for deletion.

Still, the length of time that inactivity should be demonstrated on mere stubs ought to be very considerable, as six months or even a couple of years ought to go by first instead before content is deleted for this reason.  Certainly not a matter of mere weeks.

This is not a commentary on the value of such a Wikibook project, as I think it is an entirely reasonable project that is worth spending time on, and something that the Wikibooks community ought to support in general.  I do think that writing a &quot;kids book&quot; on medicine is something that can have practical value and is a subject that ought to be taught to children.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== dmoz etc ==
Thanks - very interesting info.  Looking forward to the new contributions - I confess I hadn't particular spotted a drop in editing just that I think your considerable work goes unrecognised.  I was a user of dmoz long before I found wikipedia.  Under a previous name on wp I was a bit of a spam fighter.  A favourite approach was &quot;lets remove the current links and put in a relevant dmoz one&quot; - the more they objected the more you knew they were spammers!  There are a couple of pages here I am itching to deal with but I'm trying to be less grumpy &lt;g&gt;.  Should you ever get the urge I would be very happy to nominate you as an admin BTW, Wikijunior could use a regular admin (I know Rob is around as well) - I could bore you with the pros and cons but you know where I am.

:Some wiki articles are dire.  My favourite bad one here [[Blender 3D/Tutorial Links List]].  I have no idea what use this is, I'm sure many of the links are likely to be dead and where would you start - I'll do it one day.
:&quot;privileges&quot; (tho I would see them as mere tools - no idea what the fuss is about, some should be with competent editors anyway, anything is reversible).

== Arbitration ==

One thing I want to mention privately to you is that I don't think you necessarily have to be an administrator in order to get involved with arbitration &quot;cases&quot;.  Frankly at this point, I think Panic is fighting an uphill battle and he knows it.  This is not to say that SB Johnny necessarily was correct to have blocked Panic, even though he thinks he was completely in the best position to make that assumption.  Unfortunately, I think it turned him into a belligerant party instead of being a mediator.

One thing I can use is some help doing a little legwork.  This is apparently an issue that has gone over several months and has driven away a few people who may have made a bit of a positive difference to Wikibooks.  While Johnny was inclined to do a user block, he didn't feel that he needed to revert the changes afterward done by Panic.  That seems a bit curious to me and is something that I'm trying to get some background information about this whole mess.

If you can find some edits or very heated words that seem to be very much out of order in the C++ Programming Wikibooks, it would be appreciated.  Things like the page move logs don't seem to give me enough information to base any significant decisions that Panic is really causing any substantial problems.

If/when we decide to create an arbitration committee, I don't believe your status as an administrator should have any bearing on wheither you are able to be a part of that committee or not.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:32, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

== Bot time ==
No problem at all.  It will be tomorrow as I &quot;keep&quot; the bot at home - work might suffer otherwise (!) and equally (being of a suspicious nature) the less places I have software installed that I don't want the better (it uses .NET).

== Regarding Animal Alphabet ==

I would like to applaud you for producing brilliant illustrations used in Animal Alphabet. Though I have one inquiry. Animal Alphabet was initially intended to be read by parents to their [[Wikitoddler_Animal_Alphabet|toddlers]] and Wikijunior states it makes books for the ages 8 - 11. I would like a consensus on where Animal Alphabet should be kept, either on Wikijunior (If the age range is changed) or Wikitoddler. Regards --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 22:04, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

: The fact that it hasn't moved from Wikijunior to Wikitoddler could be considered approriate consensus. [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 22:15, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Isn’t it correct that books with a similar intention be merged? In this case, two projects with different objectives are producing a similar book. This is why I’m proposing to Xixtas that one book be merged into another where it would be suitably kept. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 22:23, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

::: Some think that books containing similar content should automatically be merged. Others don't. I subscribe to the latter view. And that doesn't mean that I think that two similar books should ''never'' be merged, but I don't think that it should be assumed that because they have similar content they should be merged. (BTW Xixtas, sorry for starting a convo on your talk page that does not yet even involve you. I noticed the topic on recent changes and wanted to pop in. I know that some people get peeved when this sort of convo happens, and I don't intend to annoy you.) [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 22:30, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: I have no problem with conversation here, but thank you for being so considerate. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 01:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC) 

: I've kind of started to feel (after reading everything that I could about wikijunior here and on meta and in mailing list discussions etc.) that wikijunior doesn't even really exist as a project separate from wikibooks. It's really whatever _we_ (meaning the larger wikibooks community) want to make it at this point because no-one outside of wikibooks seems to give a hoot about it. Whatever it was originally supposed to be seems to have fallen by the wayside. I think if we want to put up books for toddlers or older kids and there are people here who want to write them, we can do that in wikijunior. There's no reason to put together a whole new namespace or pseudo-namespace for them. 

: I didn't know what wikitoddler was or that there was another animal alphabet book proposed when I started working on this one (more than a month ago) or when I started putting it up a week ago. I still don't know what wikitoddler is really. I guess I would have expected such a project to be at least mentioned on the talk page at wikijunior. All that said, I'm amenable to whatever the community wants to do with it. I'm not sure that merging the two books is a great idea, but I will let others decide as I'm too close to the situation. I built the book for my niece as a birthday gift and now I'm donating it to wikibooks. 

: BTW, where was the wikitoddler namespace discussed? I must have missed it. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 01:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

:: I weren't aware of Wikijunior's current state and apologise for not contacting you as I irresponsibly only discussed [[Wikitoddler]] on IRC. Wikitoddler essentially originated from my presumption that Wikijunior's age scope could not be expanded and my unease with discussing the issue at Wikimedia Meta. As I see you to be a prominent editor at Wikijunior, I would like to discuss if the target age could be broadened. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 18:25, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

== Community ==

I'd love to hear your complaints about community decisions here over at my talk page. Unfortunately any objections you had to what the arbitration proceedings were becoming came a bit too late and I wish you voiced them before action was taken. As [[User:Darklama]] stated, admins are certainly not the entire community here, we just happen to be quite active and thus play large roles in decisions. That's not how it has to be though! I simply want to keep your faith in the administrative staff here, especially since you are not a sysop yet are a definite member of the Wikibooks community. So far you are the first user (besides the obviously involved parties) to express disapproval of the arbitration ending. I too had no part in it until the end and would like to hear a little about what others think of the process. Of course the action will not be undone but it's great to learn from this and avoid the need for such strong action in the future. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:37, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

:I certainly agree that the ending delivered was the inevitable. A quick response to your points:

#I personally had nothing to do with IRC and gathered all evidence over several weeks of the process beginning, continuing, and stagnating. I've used IRC twice in my entire time here, the second time being just yesterday after I made a decision and thought people might want to chat about it. Numerous user postings around the site evolved this opinion apart from two e-mails I received on the subject. All discussion to show the damage is available around the site and by how I rendered my decision. I could clearly see the discontent and sadness here.
#Uncivil behavior continued from the last block (and before of course) and throughout the attempt at arbitration. Panic rarely if ever acknowledged anything he did could even be slightly inappropriate and tried to soapbox himself around policy. He continued to attack basic facts and was essentially impossible to work with.
#Perhaps you see some of the actions of the &quot;other side&quot; as going unnoticed, but again I think it goes back to civility where Panic would not have stopped what he was doing without being forced through a block. Johnny tried to contain the situation to the best of his ability and it's amazing he's even continuing to edit here after all the abuse he's taken over trying to defend a book from Panic's page moves, reverts, and comments to new users.
#This was much, much more than a block appeal. This process was a full analysis of all previous actions and meant to be a final solution. Some users suggested that Panic be blocked infinitely due to his constant disrespect. I was somewhat brief with the write-up of my decision since I believed the reasons were quite well known from reading the past history of the arbitration process. Numerous rule-breaking instances occurred for several months previous to this action. I apologize if you were not as informed as I felt the community was with the previous arbitration steps. All the documentation for these blocks and the many offenses Panic committed are in the &quot;plaintiff&quot; remarks.
#Again, many of us did discuss this publicly and wanted an end. The arbitration process was not agreed to by the community in the first place and I saw the community eroding before me with the stagnated arbitration. I chose to act in order to hopefully keep several users from leaving here, even if it meant that one user needed to have some time off to reassess his attitude. The six-month block is meant to be a time of healing, both for the C++ book and for the users affected. This time period will also let users reflect on their past actions and better themselves for the future. Whiteknight also laid out some terms he wants all to abide by, including keeping conflict out of the C++ book and keeping Johnny and Panic separated for the rest of their work here at Wikibooks.

:Not so short now that I've typed it, but I feel I've answered the issues appropriately enough. After this I plan on going back to business as usual here, welcoming back or trying to coerce back some of the users that have left here because of this and repair the damages all these arguments have created. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 04:59, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

==Post-arbitration-decision &quot;coaching&quot;==
Considering all the troubles that have come out of the final decision about Panic, I've decided to get involved again to see if there's a way of re-integrating him into the community. My approach will be to engage in calm dialog with him, as a &quot;coach&quot;. You can see the beginning of this [[User_talk:Panic2k4#Trying_to_explain|here]]. My intent is to get to a point where he makes it clear that he (1) understands the problem, (2) will try to avoid the problem in the future, (3) will make a commitment to not getting into trouble again, and (4) will understand that we will prevent him from causing further problems. I've made a more formal proposal of this [[User_talk:Withinfocus#A_suggestion|on Matt's talk page]], since he is ''de facto'' the current arbitrator, and therefore the person in charge.

I must ask you to stay out of this for now (''especially'' during the first step), unless you feel that I'm being horribly unfair. Panic needs to focus on this first point, and having more than one person to talk to will (in my opinion) just spur him into playing us off one another. He needs to look at his own behavior in an objective way, and I'm going to do my best to help him in that task. 

I should point out now that while step 4 might seem harsh and threatening, it's meant to be the opposite. If further blocks are performed, I'd like these to be &quot;time outs&quot;, rather than punitive measures... little breaks where he is given time to rethink and explain. I know this guy a bit now, and I know he likes to see how far he can push any envelope. The point is to allow no games. I strongly suggest that his block be considered indefinite until he agrees to get along, and that he should not be threatened with an ''infinite'' block unless he ''really'' games this system.

This might be a wasted effort, but it's worth a shot. I'm asking for your support. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:50, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

== Attacked ==

Could you please tell me where I mentioned that I was attacked? Perhaps a better word could have been used, but this was an addressable situation and then as soon as I performed an action people came out of nowhere. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 13:38, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
:Ah, I see. I certainly am being attacked about supposedly being an inappropriate admin on the matter. Your dissatisfaction with the process is different from objections to the block, but if they mix together to you, then yes I feel that respect for me has been lowered and my reputation tarnished due to others' comments even when I felt there was plenty of time to discuss this issue before my actions. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 14:23, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

== Thanks for your &quot;defense&quot; ==

You have been an island of sanity in the whole discussion about Panic and what should be done.

In many ways I wish I had maintained a little more composure, but I also felt (perhaps improperly) threatend and personally attacked.  I certainly was not happy with the final result of the arbitration, and felt that a more reasoned decision could have been made by somebody who didn't seem to have as much of an axe to grind.

What is awsome here is that we seem to have a fairly good diversity of administrators on Wikibooks, where the actions of one or even a group of them can be undone if somebody goes too far, as was done here.  To me, this is an incredible milestone, and something that perhaps in another context would really be a cause for celebration.  '''The Wiki concept really does work!'''  I need to put more faith in that larger Wikibooks community than I have so far.

Wikibooks indeed has matured and turned into a very healthy project.  There will be ups and downs over the next several months and years, and this whole episode will eventually (probably later than sooner) be forgotten and be left as a historical footnote.  There are some exciting things that are happening here on Wikibooks, and I want to be a part of them.  I also want to get back to what I came here for:  To write some really cool textbooks that can transfer some of the knowledge I have and be useful to many other people.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:49, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

== A Sea Change ==

&lt;small&gt;''archived from [[User Talk:Panic2k4]]''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have some questions for you.
&lt;pre&gt;&quot;Full fathom five thy father lies:
Of his bones are coral made:
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.&quot; -- William Shakespeare&lt;/pre&gt; 
A man drowned in violent tempest has become beautiful in death. I wonder whether the sea has changed you.

&lt;pre&gt;&quot;We cannot become what we need to be by remaining what we are.&quot; -- Max Dupree&lt;/pre&gt;
I believe it is necessary to find change within ourselves to accomplish great things. 

&lt;pre&gt;&quot;Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&quot; 
-- Attributed to Albert Einstein''&lt;/pre&gt;
Past results in this situation have not been very good. I think that everyone wants different results in the future. Only '''you''' have the power to change the outcome here. Argument and disagreement are only healthy in moderate doses. Continuous argument damages all of our goals. 

&lt;pre&gt;&quot;Identity would seem to be the garment with which one covers the nakedness of the self, 
in which case, it is best that the garment be loose, a little like the robes of the 
desert, through which one's nakedness can always be felt, and, sometimes, discerned. 
This trust in one's nakedness is all that gives one the power to change one's robes.&quot; 
-- James Arthur Baldwin&lt;/pre&gt;
One can be true to oneself and still change. In fact, it is the presence of a strong self that makes the change possible. 

So... My question for you is, how has the sea changed you? What will you do to move the situation forward? What garments will you wear? How will you begin to achieve different results than you have in the past? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:15, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

== Response to proposal to lift Panic's block ==

I am concerned about two things in particular as far as lifting the block: 
#'''Panic's stance on editorial control of the C++ book.''' The contributions and changes made by other contributors in that book during Panic's block must be respected. There should be no reversion of what has been done and the status quo should be recognized as &quot;the way things are now&quot; not &quot;the way things were before Panic was blocked.&quot; If Panic would like to change the way the book is now, there must be a broader consensus to change it. Ideally, revisions should build on the work done before, not tear it down. Panic must recognize that all contributors should have a voice in the book and that the differentiation he makes between authors and non-authors is not recognized by Wikibooks or Wikimedia. I am concerned that Panic's first action after being unblocked would be to return the C++ book to the way it was before the second block. That would not be fair to the other contributors or good for Wikibooks.  
#'''Panic's lack of recognition of his own uncivil behavior.''' Soapboxing, being disruptive to make a point, imposing deadlines, failure to assume good faith, biting newbies, wikilawyering, taunting, using sockpuppets to evade a ban, trolling, not abiding by the terms of a remediation, aggressively refactoring talk pages, and misrepresenting others' statements are all uncivil behaviors. I believe, based on the communications I have read that Panic has engaged in each of these behaviors. Further, even though other Wikibookians (including myself) have also engaged in *some of* these same uncivil behaviors, Panic engages in these uncivil behaviors far more than any other Wikibookian. The fact that he still refuses to recognize '''any''' of his own behavior as uncivil is very troubling to me.

:To Xistas, Xistas it should be clear to you that I don't want and never did want sole control of the book, refactoring etc (please refer to it as allegations made by SB Jhonny and Darklama) or prove it as a fact, continue to repeat false accusations as if they were facts is damaging to me...
:More rules, policy or even basic reason has gone out of the door long and the high point was the way the arbitration ended, that is not how things should be done, we shouldn't use votes by majority just to avoid similar actions, every other action I took was not and is not against policy or even good sense, you may consider it civil disobedience but in no way anyone was directly targeted by my actions, I'm not the reason we are in this situation, I was forced into it, consider it reactions, I took great care this time to be the most correct I could be. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:14, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

::I do not believe you have been uncivil because Darklama and SBJohnny (and many others) allege it. I believe it is so because I have observed it. Removing my post just now so that people can only read your reply but not what I wrote (without going to more trouble) was uncivil. Though there is no rule against it and you are within your rights to do so on your talk page, it was still uncivil. Should you be blocked for it? of course not. But it's one more grain of sand in the weight of your growing body of incivility. I will &lt;strike&gt;moved&lt;/strike&gt; copy my original comment and the responses to my [[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]] page so that those who wish to read it may do so without sifting through the hall of mirrors that is the history of this page.

:::I then agree with you all parties are to blame on the BECIVIL part at one point or another if you take it to such a high level, I think that is why the policy is not so well defined, it does indeed facilitate its abuse, interpretations may vary like the one you stated, I would agree if that was my intention (to prevent others reading your post), but I could also allege that it was bad faith of you to expect that from me :) , I then say that I have god faith in you :) that it was not what you were implying but you see the mess we can get into if we take those as policies to extremes (it is my opinion that they should be made guidelines and exact and extreme situations of personal attack should be covered by specific policy, that would be much clearer (I stated so on those policies talk pages). (Sorry for mangling your user name) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

::::Why is it that you refuse to consider that those who believe that you are wrong have all arrived at that conclusion independently based on a first-person review of the history and the facts at hand. Permit me my own little analogy. Ground beef goes on sale at the store for half price. The store sells twice as much ground beef as they did the week before. Does this mean there is a conspiracy to buy ground beef? No. It means that each consumer independently evaluated the facts at hand and made a judgment. Some bought more ground beef, others bought ground beef when they wouldn't have before, still others prefer to avoid ground beef entirely. Some would have bought the ground beef if it had appeared fresher. The sum total of these independent judgments was that the store sold a lot more ground beef. That doesn't mean there is a conspiracy to buy ground beef. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:14, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::Ok lets address the problems one by one you make the accusation provide the fact and we examine the policy that covers it, we can begin from the start, but then to be fair we will also address the other actions against me and I provide the facts and we will also examine the policy that covers it, are you game ?  (we can even start by Darklamas actions and my interaction with him, since I will have to address those points later this will also be useful) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::Right now I need to get back on billable time or I'm not going to be able to pay my mortgage. ;-) I'll think about your proposal in the meantime. I have a pretty busy weekend coming up with a camping trip Friday, Saturday and Sunday and a recital to attend Sunday night. This may not be the best time for me to start such an exercise. The question I have for you is what is to be gained? Will you look at what I say with an open mind and... if I demonstrate that your actions have been against the spirit of wiki, counter-productive, and uncivil will you accept that you should try to alter your behavior and agree to do so going forward? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:33, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::: :) Ok I understand. It would indeed be an exercise on how we see things and if it's really a problem with interpretation, I have been with a open mind since the start, I acknowledged several errors I committed and am open to acknowledge more and make any change to my behavior that would enable it to be so... But the analysis shouldn't be target only on my actions and you will act on policy and to the extend or your abilities to address all issues, those are the only requirements I make, if you agree and when you have the time please post the timeframe were you want to start (from the end or the beginning, I'll be hard pressed to defend my actions in reverse order but if taken into context I think there will be no problem) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:47, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

:I too was an outside observer that had nothing to do with the process, technically even less than yourself, someone who left multiple comments at the process' talk page discussing procedure and what I consider to have some investment in that process. I've left a comment at your talk page to discuss this in a limited fashion and I hope you will respond. I further hope that with some additional review of the many pages on the site discussing this matter, you will see the harm being done to the community with this arbitration and the need to end it before we lost many dedicated and productive users. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:43, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

----
Since the original Arbitrator is missing and to your (and probably other users) view that the arbitration is taking to long the only acceptable response is to void the arbitration completely and restore the previous block with my request to unblock pending decission.

I don't share your rational about my response to the accusations made, and you fail to validate or address the question on the table and further empower SBJohnny first decision that was in all regards abusive.

Since you consider that in stating my objections and comments addressing the same accusation as requested by the existing procedure I was offensive (I don't see how), you place yourself in a position that clearly opposes the right of any user to  contest actions he feels as wrong, any other blocking action will further demonstrate the irresponsibility of the use of the blocking power here on Wikibooks, since no policy does support it's use in the way you intend on using it.

Such action, in it self will be detrimental to the sense of community you are pretending to defend. As a show of respect for the same community a poll that would reflect the community wishes would have been a better decision. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:59, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

:You were given an unprecidented amount of freedom and time to refute the decision and seek redress. Rob created an entire arbitration process solely for your benefit, against even the general will of the community. This same arbitration hearing was allowed to continue for much longer then it should have. I would say, therefore, that you have been given plenty of opportunity here. 
:There might not be a current policy dictating when and how an admin may block a non-vandal user, but the absence of policy does not mean we are not capable of such blocks. Admins are allowed to use their own judgement in using admin tools, especially in situations where there is no policy. Finally, you have repeatedly violated the [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] policy, and that policy ''does say'' that users who violate the policy may be blocked.
:There will be no poll, and no discussion, and no review. This whole mess has gone on long enough. Months ago we adminstrators were asked to solve problems that you have caused, and to reprimand your bad behavior. The only error that we are guilty of is not producing a quick, decisive, unified response to the initial requests. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:57, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

:::I don't see that Rob created anything to my benefit, if he had I would not have participated, the arbitration was created to address the lack of wikibooks to support a user contesting any action he doesn't agree with, Rob was not acting on my benefit he was addressing the lack of solution to a uncommon problem that was created by what I saw as abusive behavior of an administrator.

:::As for the time the arbitration took or how it unfolded I had no control, I accepted the terms and I remind you that I was the only one that can be seen as having something to lose, that was the scope of the arbitration. I and SBJohnny were the ones involved the community role on the proceedings up to this time consisted more on voluntary comments  on how an arbitration should be established, no harm was done to the community and it attempted to provide a demonstration on how to address future problems.

:::Admins are allowed to use their own judgment but decisions on those judgments may lack community support or even violate active policies (as I say they did), Admins are only users with special rights entrusted to them by the community, under no active policy or broad interpretation can the granting of such right imply that actions can't be contested or even fall under abuse or error or that the judgment of an Admin is superior to that of a common user.

:::I didn't in any way violate the [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] as I think I proved and &lt;s&gt;other&lt;/s&gt; SBJohnny missed to provide evidence of such violations, more, the use of [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] as a gag order to users shouldn't be allowed and in itself violates the spirit of the policy. User should be able to disagree and discuss and even work toward changes and improvements to the community.

:::''Months ago we adminstrators were asked to solve problems that you have caused, and to reprimand your bad behavior.''

:::This statement is incorrect, I didn't cause any problems or engaged in bad behavior. The problems you are referring to were started by Darklama move of pages and deletion of content from a book, I asked the user and tried to come to an agreement with him and even tried to get some comment from administrators but this weren't the objects of the arbitration.

:::As for the community error I could agree more, if policy was fallowed on the contested edits, the moves would have been reverted and the content restored as for active policies, this would have diffused and averted the situation I face now. I strongly object to statement that further try to establish we are here due to any limitation or lack of will I have to try to solve the problems in an amicable way and state the situation as ''problems I caused'', the only problems I may have caused is forcing the community to address some abusive actions that were performed on my account, this is a right I have and will pursue to the ultimate consequences as I see myself as the one that was wrongly target on a disciplinary action.

:::As for the review, I have already started action on meta as per the setting Rob established when creating the arbitration, since some events and actions are being performed that further violate active community policies and my rights and also subvert the intentions of the Arbitration and the subject and the terms I agreed on participating in it.

:::I'm not engaging in any action that will harm the community, my intention is only to be treated within the rules I agreed on in participating on the project, to avoid being made an escape goat to the community lack of will to address such problem and I think the results even if I find myself excluded from participating will be useful to the future of Wikibooks.

:::I can understand that part of the community see my actions on contesting the block as problematic or causing bad will, but it should be clear that I have nothing to gain and only to lose and that I'm only acting in the best interests of the community, I have nothing to hide and all my actions if checked are within the guidelines of the project, if someone did behave badly it wasn't me, I have already stated the actions I regret but in themselves were not violations of any active policy. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:04, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

::::I could have guessed you would have gone to meta with your appeal, and I am sure that when the folks at meta do not agree with you either, you will turn to yet a higher authority. This does not surprise me. 
::::The biggest issue between us is a disagreement, or different interpretations of the policies that we have. This is how it has been since I first got involved in this issue, and I am not surprised that you are trying to make it an issue still. It is my opinion, along with [[User:Withinfocus]], [[User:SBJohnny]], [[User:Darklama]], and other users that I will choose not to name here, that you ''did violate'' the [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] policy, on a number of occasions. There is anecdotal evidence that your pattern of behavior has been happening for as long as you have been a member here. I can understand, considering that english is not your first language, that perhaps there is a translation error with the word &quot;civil&quot;, and I would be inclined to grant you leniency on that account, if that were the case. In all your time here, how many people have stopped editing the C++ book (or all the different C++ books) because of your behavior? How many people have left wikibooks all together because of your behavior? I can name at least 1 person who did leave, 1 who was about to leave, and 1 who is currently preparing to leave because of unhappiness at your actions. I am certain there are others as well that we have not identified.
::::Beyond the [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] policy, there are no mentions in policy of admins blocking users for bad behavior, and I will admit that the Be Civil policy is a recent policy that was not in effect during some of your actions. However, admins are allowed to use judgement in such cases, and it was the decision of ''multiple admins'' that you should have been blocked. Before blocking you, SBJohnny discussed the issue with myself and multiple other wikibookians first, and we waited a long time before acting. Such forethought and planning is not common among the corrupt or abusers of power. No person likes to be disciplined, but that does not mean that you were abused, mistreated, or discriminated against. 
::::This whole situation, from your actions in the C++ book, through the arbitration have caused this community substantial harm. You claim to want to improve the community, and I don't doubt your motives, but unfortunately the reality is very different from what you claim. 
::::I will continue to monitor your user talk page so that this discussion can continue after you have been blocked. When and if you choose to return to wikibooks, I hope that we can put all this behind us. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:42, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

*reset

I only requested meta intervention because of the last days posts, it was not my intention of bringing outsiders to intervene on a solution that should have been achieved here, it is with sorrow that I did fallow that path, I'm sorry Rob couldn't complete his task...

Can you please point me out were and when I did violate the [[Wikibooks:Be civil]], that would be useful and I can then agree or have a more productive discussion on my and your interpretation of the policy and if it should apply to the problem.

Of course I will push the subject as I'm the one on the line here, not submitting to a wrong deed gives more value to 1)my intention to still participate on the project 2)be willing to admit any errors and correct them 3)refute any wrong doing so far, if I stopped pushing the issue it would be admitting that any of my actions were wrong or that I did not have any intention of being constructive, I don't like to but I'm obliged to continue.

''There is anecdotal evidence that your pattern of behavior has been happening for as long as you have been a member here.''

I don't fallow you here, can you point to such evidence ?

To be civil is to respect others as you wish to be respected, to be civil is to respond to other with the same courtesy that others address you. To be civil is to be polite, that it not to be rude. That is the bases of the policy. That is what I fallow and always did even if no policy makes it an obligation, here and everywhere.

''In all your time here, how many people have stopped editing the C++ book''

I can't respond to that nor can you respond to the reverse, how many people did I bring to wikibooks and to that project?, but please point me the one you say left Wikibooks because of my actions, even Paddu didn't live at the time because of me as I have pointed out and that was the only other user I had any other &quot;problem&quot; with. I don't know any other user that was contributing to the book that was intending on quiting because of me, if you are referring to James, please talk to the user, I took no action and did not have any &quot;problem&quot; with him and if the user took offense, I did at the proper time ask him apologies for any confusion the &quot;off topic&quot; intervention of Darklama and my reply at the time caused to him.

I feel abused in the way the blocks were performed, the time frame and actions that the blocks permitted to occur or validated, all were not done by policy and in the proper form the community validates such performance and use of that power, in that way they were indeed abusive, a simple point is that a block should not be used to replace or stop a discussion even if that was not the case as no discussion was in motion with SBJohnny at the time, this simple point demonstrates in it self a lack of respect for the Be civil or the guidelines to expect and work on the hope of the other party to have good intentions.

I give the same level of regard to the users having or not the administrative flag, to me they are users like the any other, they should, even more then others, respect and use restrain on the application of their decisions just because more is expected from them, they are expected to have a higher regard for the community that entrusted them with the power to perform actions that can cause great harm to others.

If you can provide me of any wrong doing or clear break of policy I will concede that some level of disciplinary action should be performed, but not the ones SBJohnny invoked on his blocks. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:41, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

:[[User:Paddu]] has said on more then one occasion that he stopped editing the C++ book because of your behavior. He also cited you as a reason why he would not return to this project in the future. [[User:James Dennett]] and [[User:Darklama]] were both treated badly by you on a number of occasions, and the administrative staff (myself included) received a number of complaints about you in these instances. Numerous posts and events have already been pointed out to you in the original mediation (between you and [[User:Darklama]]), in the subsequent warnings from myself and from [[User:SBJohnny]], and in the dispositions in the final arbitration. 
:Whether you believe it or understand it is not an issue here: You can and will be disciplined even if you don't understand the problem. We've made every effort to help you see the error, and we've made effort to try and fix problems. Unfortunately, all these efforts have not had the desired result, and the community opinion is that you are not civil and not nice.
:I will point out some of the issues that have gotten you here. All of these behaviors are considered &quot;uncivil&quot;:
:#Imposing deadlines on other contributors to make changes.
:#Removing posts from talk pages made by other users.
:#Threatening to revert posts by other users. 
:#Reverting posts by other users made in good faith, especially mass reverts (such as &quot;I will revert all your recent changes&quot;).
:#Preventing contributors from being listed as an &quot;author&quot; to a book or page.
:#Being unfriendly and impatient with new users (&quot;Don't bite the newbies&quot;).
:Wikibooks is a collaborative effort, and you have demonstrated on multiple occasions that you are not willing to collaborate with other editors.

::PS: I have also sent a message to [[meta:User:Redux]] explaining the situation, and asking him not to continue this fight any further. The continued escalation of this discussion, and other disciplinary discussions in the past, when good-faith efforts have been made to solve disputes, should not be encouraged or tolerated. Discipline of misbehaving users can not open to infinite appeal. Such infinite appeals and continuations appears to me as an abuse of the system. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:17, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Again I'm sorry but you are incorrect, user [[User:Paddu]] was not contributing to the book from the first day I started, he was active on the book's talk page and as can be checked on the pages logs and users contributions, the only contributions he made to the work were on the first days some spell corrections and later on only reverts and content moves (and mostly on the talk pages) this is part of the logs, I didn't saw anywhere the user Paddu state he left because of me, he did stop his presence on Wikibook altogether but some time after the &quot;fork&quot;, that solution was created by me to enable all to be productive, at least I and others have...

:::It seems you haven't read my &quot;counter argumentation&quot;, [[User:James Dennett]] was a third party that Darklama got involved by engaging me on a books talk page, the user is inexperienced and was unaware of the &quot;bigger picture&quot;, in no way my exchange of words with this user violates Be Civil or active policies.

:::As for [[User:Darklama]] I agree that in some of the last posts I could have be more polite but I'm human also, and my efforts not to get aggravated did fail a moment or other, I had been &quot;dialogging&quot; with the user for several moths, he DID violate standard policies and guidelines.

:::You are &quot;forcing&quot; some interpretations that aren't correct and are already addressed on my response to the accusation, there was no IMPOSITION OF TIME LIMITS, user James edits in question are a few scattered words, the user in question did not object to later correction I made to the page. All points 1-6 are without merit some I have addressed on the arbitration some are new but I will respond to them in a similar way.
:::(Reduction to the absurd) You [[User:Whiteknight]] have been (the value is the same).
:::#Imposing deadlines on other contributors to make changes.
:::#Removing posts from talk pages made by other users.
:::#Threatening to revert posts by other users. 
:::#Reverting posts by other users made in good faith, especially mass reverts (such as &quot;I will revert all your recent changes&quot;).
:::#Preventing contributors from being listed as an &quot;author&quot; to a book or page.
:::#Being unfriendly and impatient with new users (&quot;Don't bite the newbies&quot;).

:::Those accusations against me are without bases. I don't understand YOU doing this but it further pushes misinformation, you had the chance to intervene on the arbitration proceeding and you did, I will not repeat myself ad infinitum all the points were addressed in my response you had the chance to validate and contest those points.

:::But again those are not the topics of the arbitration, the point is, was the last block rightful and properly executed ? It clearly was not.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:15, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

::::And I will not repeat myself ad infinitem either. You may not think that your actions were uncivil, but they were, and they did draw criticisms. Users ''did complain about you'', and ''the admins did find evidence of your abuse'' during the mediation, and later during the arbitration. Large numbers of conversations were not held here on wikibooks, but were instead conducted over email, IRC, and were located on other wikis. I am sorry if you cannot find the logs, but that does not mean these conversations did not happen.
::::Your imposition of deadlines on other users, and your threatening to revert edits of other users were displayed in the arbitration. SBJohnny and other users linked to edits of yours where you exhibit these behaviors. I will not repost those links here. [[User:Darklama]] and [[User:James Dennett]] both testified in the arbitration that you were uncivil to them both when they were new users. Explanations or apologies that happened later don't really change the fact that you had been uncivil in the past. Explanations of your behavior should have happened long before the mediation and the arbitration. After the arbitration started, it was really too late to fix the mistakes. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:44, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

*reset

Again I don't agree with you, the proper forum to state any complain is Wikibooks, this is were I can have a chance of defending myself from any accusation. I saw no complain on my talk page or in the staff l. the recognized method of placing such complains.

Again I state that 1)I have no power to 2)never did, impose any deadline as is part of the arbitration record, as for [[User:James Dennett]] I did explain and apologized to him before the arbitration as soon as I realized the user had misunderstood what I said to him (it's on the arbitration logs also), but as I stated it, it was a request not an obligation to comply, the user did try to perform the requested action later but I had already corrected the subject of the request, no conflict with the user was or is intended on my part, I was never uncivil with the user and even if a reversion on the spot could have avoided the users misunderstanding and be in accord with the normal way such corrections are made I tried to understand the intention of the change in question. As a programmer if you can check the edits and you will understand what the problem was and the minor importance of the subject in question, the problem is a clear fabrication and can be checked as I gave every information on the arbitration log. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:05, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

== Xania's Comments ==

I see that the arbitration has now ended but a decision has been made by Withinfocus and not the original arbitrator (who is unavailable).  I can not support this decision.  This seems to be a whitewash and the punishment is way out of proportion.  Panic has gone out of his way to make ammends, supported the arbitration and refrained from annoying people since this began.  IK would have supported a decision by the original arbitrator (but not such a severe punishment) but if we're not doing that then we may just as well have a show of hands and vote the old fashioned way.

* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

I came across these two as they were created while on RC patrol.  Neither of them seem to me to be textbooks in their current form by any stretch of the imagination.  [[How astrology works]] has a copyright symbol on it and my enquiry on the author's talk page ([[User talk:Rohiniranjan]]) has gone unanswered. I am content that neither of them are &quot;speedy&quot; ones however as they stand I do not see that as appropriate for Wikibooks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

*'''Delete''' both as soapboxing, POV, personal essays, self-promotion, not textbooks, and plain old bad. I think these should be easy speedy deletes based upon ''content'' not upon the subject itself. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:20, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' both seem to be original works and are probably speedy delete candidates. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:02, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. The deletion policy states that we must wait a full week (6 days) between the time a page is created, and when it can be nominated for deletion. That a page isn't perfectly acceptable within the first week of it's existance should not be a surprise, it should not be a cause for alarm, and it should not be a reason to delete the page. A little patience can be a virtue. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:48, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' I agree - however if you look at the &quot;date&quot; on it it has not just been worked on now, equally there is the copyvio to address --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:54, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. But I thought that books can be deleted even if new if they are obvious candidates for speedy deletion (i.e. original works).  I would suggest that this is an original work and should be speedily deleted.

*'''Delete''' - I couldn't have put it any better than Kellen. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 23:37, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - meaningless pseudoscientific junk. [[wikipedia:user:pcu123456789|PCU123456789]] ([[wikipedia:user_talk:pcu123456789|talk]]) 19:57, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

== [[Bicycles]] ==

Hi! Per the discussion at the Reading Room, I've decided to add a section on riding for beginners. Since you're also contributing to this book, could I get your input on whether [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Bicycles&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=2013458&amp;oldid=2012589 this] or [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Bicycles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=2012589 this] is a better way to integrate the planned content (i.e., adding a direct beginner chapter versus splitting the book into two sections)? I can't decide which is better (or if there's an even better alternative). Cheers, [[User talk:Tempodivalse#top|'''''Tempodivalse''''']] 16:13, 7 January 2011 (UTC)

Thanks! I think I'm the only one over at Russian, so it's nice to finally know I'm doing a good job! You seem to know your way around Wikibooks, so I had a couple of questions, if I may... Is there a way to see all the changes made to an entire wikibook, even if the pages aren't in your watchlist?

==Hello!==
Thanks! I am really excited to help contribute to the Canadian History Wikibook! I have gone through pages and fixed a lot of the formatting. [[User:Mitchturn|Mitchturn]] ([[User talk:Mitchturn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mitchturn|contribs]]) 04:09, 11 November 2011 (UTC)


==Hello==

Thereen, Thank you for your suggestion for merging the two books. I tried to do that in the beginning, but didn't see how I could do it. You see, the way that book was put together, feels as if someone had very little understanding of the language and just put down all they knew in a random order. There is no organization to that book. I don't want to delete it, for fear of conflict with the person who made that page. I just don't see how I could conjoin the two books, so i hope that makes sense. Also, I am planning to create a series called the ''Dedicated Learner Series'', and the Hawaiian book is number one, therefore I cannot change the title of the book.

I hope you understand. Thanks for the compliments! And if you know of anyone who would be willing to have a conversation about languages, please have them start a discussion; I would love to talk with them! [[User:Master tongue|Master tongue]] ([[User talk:Master tongue|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Master tongue|contribs]]) 06:24, 27 November 2011 (UTC)

:Thank you for your quick response! Your fear of conflict with the primary authors of [[Hawaiian]] is (to my mind) not necessary. In the last 30 days, you appear to be the only user making content edits to that book. The talk page has been inactive since 2008, and there is no strict guideline in place for further development to the book. It would seem that any primary authors that once edited the book are no longer active. Also, wikibooks is perfectly suited to collaborations between authors, as well as shifts in content and focus. In short, I see no problem with you imposing your planned structure and content on the wikibook titled [[Hawaiian]]. The pre-existing content could be worked into your plans as dialogue snippets or appendixes with vocabulary to learn.

:Regarding your planned series, I am not sure that including the title of the series in each of your texts is the best course of action. I think it would be better if you were to acknowledge that each of the books you start are part of the &quot;Dedicated Learner Series&quot; on the content page of each book, rather than the title. Having simple titles, like [[Hawaiian]] makes your book more searchable, and therefore each book will reach more potential learners. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 00:11, 28 November 2011 (UTC)

::Yes, I suppose that does make a lot of sense. I will try that now. Thank you for your input in this decision. I apriciate all of your advise, and hope we can collaborate in the future on similar problems. It might take a while for me to transfer things over and change links, etc. Tell me what you think when it's all done. I would greatly accept your oppinions, as I have on this one. Thanks!

I have imported your page from Wikipedia as you requested.  It will need to be dewikied and made into a book.  Good luck.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Suriname''' is a South American country which has Guyana, Brazil and French Guyana as its neighbors. It is the only Dutch speaking country in South America, and it considers itself a member of the Caribbean. Suriname has been a member of the Caribbean community (Caricom) since 1994. Suriname is a mix of different cultures including, Dutch, French, English, Spanish, Javanese, Chinese, Creole, Indian and many others. The cuisine of Suriname is therefore also very diverse and very wonderful.

Double Chocolate Brownies&lt;br&gt;


==Ingredients==

* ⅓ cup [[Cookbook:Butter|unsalted butter]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* one 12 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] package dark or bittersweet [[Cookbook:Chocolate Chips|chocolate chips]], divided in half
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
* ¾ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|all purpose flour]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] 
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]] [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]] ''(optional)''

==Procedure==

# Let the eggs and butter sit out for 30 minutes to bring to room temperature.
# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|325°F]].
# In a small bowl sift in the flour with the baking soda and salt then set aside.
# In a small [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] combine butter, sugar, and water. Bring just to a [[Cookbook:Boil|boil]] then remove from heat.
# Add ½ of the chocolate chips (6 oz) and vanilla. Stir until smooth and shiny.
# Transfer the chocolate mixture into a large bowl.
# Add eggs one at a time [[Cookbook:Beating|beating]] well after each addition.
# Gradually blend in flour mixture.
# Stir in remaining chocolate chips and nuts if desired.
# Spread in a greased 9&quot; square pan. 
# Bake at 325°F for 30-35 minutes.
# Cool completely before cutting into 2-1/4&quot; squares.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mac OS X ==

No DejaVu version runs natively under Mac OS X. You have to use either a virtual machine solution or an API layer. These are known - so far:
* Parallels (http://www.parallels.com/), virtual machine, known to work with Windows + DVX installed, good Mac integration. DejaVu Dongle works.
*  CrossOver Office (http://www.codeweavers.com/), API layer, runs, has some issues to be solved before working as it should. Dongle doesn't work yet. Please see http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name?app_id=205 Feel free to contribute!


== Linux ==

No DejaVu version runs natively under Linux. You have to use either a virtual machine solution or an API layer. These are known - so far:
*  CrossOver Office (http://www.codeweavers.com/), API layer, has some issues to be solved before working as it should. Dongle doesn't work yet. Please see http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name?app_id=205 Feel free to contribute!


== Unix ==

So far, nobody seems to have tested running DejaVu on any Unix system, but with CrossOver available for both Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris, and Mac OS X being built on BSD, it might work (e. g. with Parallels). Possibly even via thin client, which may however run into dongle issues.


== Notes on technology ==

* Virtual machine: You install Windows into a virtual machine, which is software that behaves to Windows as if it were PC hardware. Any other software you want to run is installed &quot;as usual&quot; in that Windows system. The current development goes towards making the operating systems aware of being run in a virtual machine, which might enhance performance and get rid of some hardware access problems, like e. g. dongle handling.
* API layer: Presents the software you want to run with the interface towards the operating system it was made for and expects, in this case Windows. The other side of the interface is in this case connected to Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris UNIX etc., rather than leading to Windows. This approach rids you of having to use Windows altogether, and of introducing an additional layer for the virtual machine. Unfortunately, it instead introduces problems for software that wants direct hardware access, most notably for the dongle - so far.

'''Ajiaco''' is a quintessential dish from Bogotá, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Colombia|Colombia]].

==Ingredients==

===Soup:===

* 1 whole skin-on bone-in [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breast (approximately 750[[Cookbook:G|g]])
* 1 [[Cookbook:L|l]] chicken broth
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], peeled
* 2 [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallions]] (white part and first 2 cm of green)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], peeled
* 4 [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], peeled
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] dried [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 4 sprigs fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
* 10 [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black peppercorns]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:ML |ml]] tomato paste
* .5 [[Cookbook:Kg|kg]] small yellow [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]. peeled
* .5 [[Cookbook:Kg|kg]] small purple [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]. peeled
* .5 [[Cookbook:Kg|kg]] mashing [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled and sliced 2 cm thickness
* 1 [[Cookbook:L|l]] water
* 2 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] of beef bullion granules
* .25 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] of frozen [[Cookbook:Peas|peas]]

===Garnishes:===

* 4 ears of [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]], quartered lengthwise and cooked 
* 10 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] of whipping cream mixed with 10 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] of créme fraíche
* 2 ripe but firm Hass [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocados]], peeled, pitted and cut into eight slices right before serving
* 10 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] of finely chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
* 5 - 10 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] of pickled [[Cookbook:Caper|capers]]

==Procedure==

# Combine chicken, broth, onions, scallions, carrots, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, cumin, cilantro and peppercorns in large sauce pan and bring to a boil. Skim off froth as it rises. Reduce heat to low and cover when frothing finishes. 
# Remove and reserve chicken after it is cooked through (approximately 20 minutes). 
# Strain broth through sieve and return to pot, boil again over medium heat. Reserve carrots.
# Add tomato paste and yellow and purple potatoes. Cover and cook until potatoes are soft (approximately 20 minutes).
# While yellow and purple potatoes are cooking, boil sliced mashing potatoes in water and beef bullion in separate pot. Once boiling, reduce to medium heat until potatoes start to fall apart (approximately 30 minutes). 
# Drain and reserve a quarter of the slices and mash the rest of the sliced potatoes.  Add mashed and sliced potatoes to soup.
# Remove bones and skin from chicken and discard.  Cut chicken into strips 1 cm wide and 3 cm long. 
# Add chicken and peas to soup and simmer for 5 minutes.  Slice the carrots into .5 cm thick rounds and add back into soup. Salt to taste.
# Serve hot with garnishes available.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

* If soup is too thick add boiling water in small amounts; the consistency should be like that of heavy cream.  Soup will thicken as it cools.

Towards this move black has basically two typical set ups. 

*One is a fortress like position with pawn structure f5-e6-d5. This is called the Stonewall defence. This type of position is considered solid, but perhaps too static.

*A dynamic choice is a Leningrad setup. The pawn structure is practically always g6-f5-d6. Black plays in this system, with only a few rare exceptions, his bishop to g7, knight to f6, and castles quickly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Deep Depression income-expenditure model - Keynesian Multipliers'''

One way to describe the economy is with the equation &lt;math&gt;Y~=~C~+~Z+~G&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;~Y&lt;/math&gt; represents total income, &lt;math&gt;~C&lt;/math&gt; represents consumption, and &lt;math&gt;~Z&lt;/math&gt; represents investment (other than government investment, of course).  If the economy under discussion is that of a country, &lt;math&gt;~Y&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as approximating the countries &lt;math&gt;~GNP&lt;/math&gt;.  We can think of consumption as a function of disposable income &lt;math&gt;C~=~\lambda(Y-T)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;~T&lt;/math&gt; is taxes where &lt;math&gt;~\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the Marginal Propensity to Consume.


The ''Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)'' is the rate of growth of consumption in terms of an increase in disposable income and is defined as the derivative of the consumption function, &lt;math&gt; \lambda~ = ~\frac{dC}{dY} &lt;/math&gt;.  Assuming all spending is divided evenly between consumption and savings, the ''Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)'' is defined as the rate of growth in savings in terms of an increase in disposable income and is calculated as &lt;math&gt;MPS~ =~ 1-MPC &lt;/math&gt;.


==Multipliers==
===GEM - Government expenditure multiplier===
The GEM considers the idea that since only a percentage of money that anyone receives is saved, and the rest is put back into the economy.  So if the government gives someone a dollar (deficit spending), it will end up meaning that much more than a dollar will be added to the economy.  One way to think about it is the GEM is the amount that &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, total income, changes as &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, government expenditure changes.  So we look at our formula with the consumption function included, we have:

&lt;math&gt;Y~=~\lambda(Y-T)+~Z+~G&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow dY = \lambda dY+dG&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow dY(1-MPC)=dG&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \frac{dY}{dG} = \frac{1}{1-MPC}&lt;/math&gt;, which, in fact, gives,

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow GEM = \frac{dY}{dG} = \frac{1}{MPS}&lt;/math&gt;

===TCM - Tax Cut Multiplier===
In this case, we want to know how much a change in the tax rate will affect total income.  Our derivation follows the same lines as before.  In this case we have:

&lt;math&gt;Y~= ~\lambda (Y-T)+~Z+~G&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow dY = \lambda (dY-dT)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow dY=MPC(dY-dT)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow dY(1-MPC)=-MPC~dT&lt;/math&gt;, which gives,

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow TCM = \frac{dY}{dT} = -\frac{MPC}{1-MPC} = -\frac{MPC}{MPS}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, &lt;math&gt; |GEM| \geq |TCM| &lt;/math&gt; since:
&lt;math&gt; MPC \leq 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

===BBM - Balanced Budget Multiplier===
This is a sort of combination of the previous two multipliers, where any change in spending corresponds to a change in tax rates, i.e. &lt;math&gt;dG ~= dT&lt;/math&gt;.  Now we can take the derivative of our equation with respect to all three variables.

&lt;math&gt;Y~=~\lambda~ (Y-T)+~Z+~G&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow dY = \lambda(dY-dT)+dG &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow dY=MPC(dY-dT)+dG&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow dY(1-MPC)=-MPC~dT+dG &lt;/math&gt;. Now we set &lt;math&gt;dG~=dT&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow dY(1-MPC)=dT(1-MPC)&lt;/math&gt;, which gives,

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow BBM = \frac{dY}{dT} = \frac{dY}{dG} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Thus if the we have a balanced budget with respect to government spending and taxation, total income will be unchanged.

===More information===
In general the theoretical multipliers are higher than the actual multipliers.  Why?  In general agents tend to want to smoothen their consumption over their lifetime, thus they do not respond fully to exogenous shocks.  Taxes distort.  The model is isolated from the outside world.  Other reasons?

These 3 users plus an IP were all connected to large scale vandalism around 30 minutes ago which saw the creation of about 20 pages of offensive vandalism, page moves of the Chess wikibooks and an attempt by &quot;Blueknight&quot; to pass himself off as an administrator from another project.  I think all of their contributions have been reverted or deleted but can someone please check.  I have also blocked all users indefinitely as they created one hell of a mess and pissed me right off.  A CU would be nice too.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:18, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

All 3 users (obviously the same person) have been infinitely blocked this evening.  Their edits consisted of Nigeria 411 or other similar messages requesting 'donations'.  These messages were posted on user talk pages and also on other pages including [RFA].  Can someone check user these (although I guess they're using anon proxies)?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Three days after Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, Britain and France declared war. At the time a large majority of Australia's population was of direct British descendants (After all Australia is a British nation)and opposed the German expansion; thus supporting Britain. After the British Government declared war, Prime Minister Menzies announced that ‘Australia was also at war’. 

The Australian forces had a difficult decision to make: Defend Australian soil from a possible threat (from Japan), or to support the British forces in Europe. After Japan announced its neutrality and Britain reassured that its naval base in Singapore would stop any Japanese forces advancing; Australia almost completely committed all its forces to supporting the British.       

A force and supply system was put into place by Prime Minister Menzies to help prepare the nation for war. The Royal Australian Navy was placed under the control of the British; the Army began recruiting and training men; the nation was preparing its self for war.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck!

{{miskito_comment|It was explained before that a verb form such as '''daukisa''' comes from '''dauki''' (a participle, ''doing'') and '''sa''' ''is''. In order to say ''I am doing, you are doing..'', and also ''I do, you do...'', the appropriate form of ''to be'' is placed after the ''i''-form (e.g. '''dauki'''), and this gives us the regular present tense, with these endings:}}

{{miskito_comment|The endings of the future tense are similar to those of the present, but begin with ''ai'' rather than ''i''. Another way to produce the future is to remove the final ''-a'' from the infinitive and add, in its place, the present-tense forms of '''kaia''', thus '''daukaia →  daukai- → daukaisna, daukaisma, daukaisa'''. Compare the present and the future of '''daukaia''':}}

== Cuisine of Suriname ==

G'day, nice to see someone building up the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Suriname|Cuisine of Suriname]]! Are you planning on adding recipes for those dishes, or just basic descriptions of what they are? If you are planning on adding recipes, you might want to have a read of our [[Cookbook:Policy|Cookbook policy]] page, which outlines some basic formatting tips. I've created a category for these recipes to go into: [[:Category:Surinamese recipes]] (but please only add actual recipes to that category, not just meal descriptions).

== Pigment seeds ==

G'day, just checked out your recipe for [[Cookbook:Pastei|Pastei]] - very nice. I don't know what one of the ingredients is, however: pigment seeds. Is this some type of seed used for colouring the dish? Can you tell me what plant it is the seed from?

Actually, I was also unsure about another ingredient: 1 fresh pepper. Does this mean:
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorn]]?
* [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]] (capsicum)?
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]]?

      <text xml:space="preserve">*'''Windows Aero:''' a new hardware-based graphical user interface, named ''Windows Aero''&amp;nbsp;– an acronym (possibly a backronym) for ''Authentic, Energetic, Reflective, and Open''. The new interface is intended to be cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing than those of previous Windows, including new transparencies, animations and eye candy.
*'''Windows Shell:''' The new Windows shell is significantly different from Windows XP, offering a new range of organization, navigation, and search capabilities. Windows Explorer's task pane has been removed, integrating the relevant task options into the toolbar. A &quot;Favorite links&quot; pane has been added, enabling one-click access to common directories. The address bar has been replaced with a breadcrumb navigation system. The Start menu has changed as well; it no longer uses ever-expanding boxes when navigating through Programs. Even the word &quot;Start&quot; itself has been removed in favor of a blue Windows Orb (also called &quot;Pearl&quot;).
*'''Windows Search''' (also known as ''Instant Search'' or ''search as you type''): significantly faster and more thorough search capabilities. Search boxes have been added to the Start menu, Windows Explorer, and several of the applications included with Vista. By default, Instant Search indexes only a small number of folders such as the start menu, the names of files opened, the Documents folder, and the user's e-mail. Advanced options allow to choose for a specific file type how it should be indexed, the properties only or the properties and the file contents or exclude it.
*'''Windows Sidebar:''' A transparent panel anchored to the side of the screen where a user can place Desktop Gadgets, which are small applets designed for a specialized purpose (such as displaying the weather or sports scores). Gadgets can also be placed on other parts of the Desktop, if desired.
*'''Windows Internet Explorer 7:''' new user interface, tabbed browsing, [RSS, a search box, improved printing, Page Zoom, Quick Tabs (thumbnails of all open tabs), a number of new security protection features, and improved web standards support. IE7 in Windows Vista runs in isolation from other applications in the operating system (protected mode); exploits and malicious software are restricted from writing to any location beyond Temporary Internet Files without explicit user consent.
*'''Windows Media Player 11''', a major revamp of Microsoft's program for playing and organizing music and video. New features in this version include word wheeling (or &quot;search as you type&quot;), a completely new and highly graphical interface for the media library, photo display and organization, and the ability to share music libraries over a network with other Vista machines, Xbox 360 integration, and support for other Media Center Extenders.
*'''Backup and Restore Center:''' Includes a backup and restore application that gives users the ability to schedule periodic backups of files on their computer, as well as recovery from previous backups. Backups are incremental, storing only the changes each time, minimizing the disk usage. It also features CompletePC Backup (available only to Ultimate, Business, and Enterprise versions) which backs up an entire computer as an image onto a hard disk or DVD. CompletePC Backup can automatically recreate a machine setup onto new hardware or hard disk in case of any hardware failures.
*'''Windows Mail:''' A replacement for Outlook Express that includes a completely replaced mail store that improves stability, and enables real-time search. It has the Phishing Filter like IE7 and a Junk mail filtering which is enhanced through regular updates via Windows Update.&lt;ref name=&quot;windowsmail&quot;&gt;Windows Mail was demonstrated by the development team in [http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=116711 this Channel 9 video].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Windows Calendar''' is a new calendar and task application.
*'''Windows Photo Gallery''', a photo and movie library management application. WPG can import from digital cameras, tag and rate individual items, adjust colors and exposure, create and display slideshows (with pan and fade effects), and burn slideshows to DVD.
*'''Windows DVD Maker''', a companion program to Windows Movie Maker, which provides the ability to create video DVDs based on a user's content.
*'''Windows Meeting Space''' is the replacement for NetMeeting. Users can share applications (or their entire Desktop) with other users on the local network, or over the Internet using peer-to-peer technology (higher versions than Starter and Home Basic can take advantage of hosting capabilities, limiting previous to &quot;join&quot; mode only)
*'''Windows Media Center''', which was previously exclusively bundled as a separate version of Windows XP, known as Windows XP Media Center Edition, will be incorporated into the Home Premium and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista.
*'''Games:''' Every game included with Windows has been rewritten to take advantage of Vista's new graphics capabilities. New games include Chess Titans, Mahjong Titans and Purble Place. The Games section will also hold links and information to all games on the user's computer. One piece of information that will be shown is the game's ESRB rating.
*'''Shadow Copy''' automatically creates backup copies of files and folders, with daily frequency. Users can also create &quot;shadow copies&quot; by setting a System Protection Point using the System Protection tab in the System control panel. The user can be presented multiple versions of a file throughout a limited history and be allowed to restore, delete, or copy those versions. This feature is available only in the Business, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista and is inherited from Windows Server 2003.
*'''Windows Mobility Center''' is a new control panel that centralizes the most relevant information related to mobile computing (e.g. brightness, sound, battery level / power scheme selection, wireless network, screen orientation, presentation settings, etc.).
*'''Windows Update:''' Software and security updates have been simplified, now operating solely via a control panel instead of as a web application. Mail's spam filter and Defender's definitions will also be automatically updated via Windows Update.
*'''Parental controls:''' Allows administrators to control which websites, programs, and games each standard user can use and install.
*'''Windows SideShow:''' Enables the auxiliary displays on newer laptops or on supported Windows Mobile devices. It is meant to be used to display Device gadgets while the computer is on or off.
*'''Speech recognition''' is fully integrated into Vista. It is an improved version of Microsoft Speech Recognition currently working under Office 2003, with a better interface, a rich and flexible set of commands, and an extensive command-and-control capability to activate the computer by voice. Unlike the Office 2003 version, which works only in Office and WordPad, it works for dictation system-wide. In addition, it currently supports several languages: English US and UK, Spanish, French, German, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), and Japanese.
*New fonts, including several designed especially for screen reading, and new high-quality Chinese (Yahei, JhengHei), Japanese (Meiryo) and Korean (Malgun) fonts. ClearType has also been enhanced and enabled by default.
*'''Problem Reports and Solutions''', a new control panel which allows users to see previously sent problems and any solutions or additional information that is available.
*Improved audio controls allow the system-wide volume or volume of individual audio devices and even individual applications to be controlled separately. Introduced new audio functionalities such as Room Correction, Bass Management and Speaker Fill.
*'''System Performance Assessment''' is a benchmark used by Windows Vista to regulate the system for optimum performance. Games can take advantage of this feature, reading the data produced by this benchmark in order to fine-tune the game details. The benchmark tests CPU, RAM, Graphics acceleration (2D and 3D) and disk access.
*'''Windows Ultimate Extras''': The Ultimate Edition of Windows Vista provides access to extra games and tools, available through Windows Update. This replaces the Microsoft Plus! software bundle that was sold alongside prior versions of Windows.

== I'm nosy! ==

Hi Peter - I checked out the wiki link and spotted the interest.  As far as I can see I think it would be a very good idea indeed.  There are one or two books on active pursuits but I don't think any of them are very active at present.  Take a look around and get a feel for the place too - it is not like Wikipedia in many ways.  Far smaller community for a start.  If you have some content of WP it can be transwiki'd to preserve what there is (again check around the links).  Certainly one issue is you will find far less wiki links here (I started placing them when I got here and had it pointed out to me!).

If I can help let me know otherwise the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] is a good place for general queries.  The book sounds good - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:57, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Road terms */ some of this stuff does not work outside istanbul!</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">''Note: Under the paragraph &quot;Road Terms&quot;, there is an unfinished list of vocabulary. Please add some more if you can.''

''Not: &quot;Road Terms&quot; (Yol Sözcükler) paragrafında bir bitmemiş sözlük var. Eğer yapabiliyorsan, lütfen sözlüğe daha sözcükler ekle.''


Turkey is a very touristic place, and with so much to do there, one can easily get lost. Therefore, knowing how to ask for directions would be very useful. Whilst learning, take an opportunity to gaze into the highlights of Turkey (still adding new pictures!)

==Grammar==
[[Image:Whirling Dervishes, Konya, Turkey, RMO.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Whirling dervishes in Konya. One would be amazed by both how beautiful the dance is and also the fact that they can somehow manage to spin around for so long without getting dizzy!]]
Let's start with:
'''Ben plaj''a'' nasıl gidebilirim?'''
How can I get ''to'' the beach?

Notice the italics in both of the sentences. When the letters '''a''' or '''e''' are added to the ends of nouns, that means the speaker is trying to get ''to''/give something ''to'' whatever the noun is, in this case, the beach. Let's look at some more examples of this:

'''Ben ev''e'' gidiyorum.'''
I'm going home.

'''Sen okul''a'' gidiyorsun.'''
You're going to school.

'''O tatil''e'' gidiyor.'''
He/she is going on holiday.

When using proper nouns (such as city or country names), you must always add an apostrophe after the noun before adding '''a''' or '''e'''. For example:

'''Biz Mısır'a gidiyoruz.'''
We're going to Egypt.

'''Siz İstanbul'a gidiyorsunuz.'''
You (plural) are going to Istanbul.

'''Onlar Londra'ya gidiyorlar.'''
They're going to London.

If you look at the last example, you'll notice that after '''Londra''', there was a '''ya''', rather than an '''a'''. '''Ya''' or '''ye''', rather than '''a''' or '''e''' respectively, are used when the  noun ends with a vowel. For example:

'''Ben Ankara'ya gidiyorum'''
I'm going to Ankara.

'''Sen Amerika'ya gidiyorsun'''
You're going to America.

'''O Tokyo'ya gidiyor'''
He/she is going to Tokyo.

OK, so know that we know the grammar of it all, let's move on to the main topic of this lesson: '''Asking for directions'''.

==Main topic==
[[Image:Istanbul bridge.jpg|right|275px|thumb|Ah, Istanbul! So much to do there, but one can easily get lost!]]
Let's start with our first question, and then build up into a proper conversation. You will probably be asking a stranger, therefore it is imperative to be polite and refer to him/her in the plural form: '''siz''' rather than '''sen'''.

There are a few different ways of asking for directions in Turkish, all with almost literal translations into English:

*'''Ben plaja nasıl ''giderim''?''' - How do I get to the beach?
*'''Ben müzeye nasıl ''gidebilirim''?''' - How can I get to the museum?
*'''Siz İzmir'e nasıl gidildiğini biliyor musunuz?''' - Do you know how to get to Izmir?

Before you know how to engage in conversation with this person, it would be a good idea to actually learn how to say directions in Turkish.

===Directions===
*'''sol(a)''' - (to the) left
*'''sağ(a)''' - (to the) right
*'''ileri(ye)''' - (to the) forward
*'''geri(ye)''' - (to the) backwards


*'''Kuzey(e)''' - (to the) North
*'''Güney(e)''' - (to the) South
*'''Doğu(ya)''' - (to the) East
*'''Batı(ya)''' - (to the) West


*'''Kuzeydoğu(ya)''' - (to the) Northeast
*'''Güneydoğu(ya)''' - (to the) Southeast
*'''Güneybatı(ya)''' - (to the) Southwest
*'''Kuzeybatı(ya)''' - (to the) Northwest

====More complex matters====

When you ask someone how to get to, say, the museum for example, they're not just going to say, ''&quot;Go North!&quot;''. It's most likely to be something much more complex, such as ''&quot;As you go down the road, take the 2nd left turn, then at the next junction, take a right turn...&quot;''. Below is some useful vocabulary which you will need to learn in order to understand what on Earth this stranger is telling you! Please note that Turkey uses the metric system, so they will most likely tell you distances in metres and kilometres rather than yards and miles.

=====The metric system, in Turkish=====
The terms are almost exactly the same as U.K. English, but not U.S. English. I have organized the vocabulary below into the following layout:
'''Türkçe''' - ''U.K. English'' - U.S. English.

:Note: don't forget that units preceded by a number do not take the plural as they do in English, so you never have to affix -ler or -lar when giving the number of meters, kilometers, and so on. Just the number.

*'''milimetre''' - ''millimetre'' - millimeter
*'''santimetre''' - ''centimetre'' - centimeter
*'''metre''' - ''metre'' - meter
*'''kilometre''' - ''kilometre'' - kilometer

=====The imperial system, in Turkish=====
It's unlikely that you'll ever use this vocab, but there may be instances where you will have to use the imperial system. So learn all these units, just in case...

*'''inç''' - inch
*'''ayak''' - foot (''ayak'' also means the actual body part)
*'''yarda''' - yard
*'''mil''' - mile

=====Ordinal numbers=====
You won't be able to know how to say ''&quot;take your '''2nd''' left&quot;'' without learning ordinal numbers in Turkish. For this section, I will use the following layout:

bir'''inci''' - ''1.'' - 1st

Rather than adding st's, nd's, rd's, or th's at the end of cardinal numbers to make them ordinal, in Turkish you simply add a full stop. Anyway, now that we know how to say '''1st''' in Turkish, let's learn the rest of them up to 10th.

*iki'''nci''' - ''2.'' - 2nd
*üç'''üncü''' - ''3.'' - 3rd
*dörd'''üncü''' - ''4.'' - 4th (dört - four, dör'''t'''üncü becomes dör'''d'''üncü)
*beş'''inci''' - ''5.'' - 5th
*altı'''ncı''' - ''6.'' - 6th
*yedi'''nci''' - ''7.'' - 7th
*sekiz'''inci''' - ''8.'' - 8th
*dokuz'''uncu''' - ''9.'' - 9th
*on'''uncu''' - ''10.'' - 10th

As you can see, when Turkish ordinal numbers are written out fully, they're just cardinal numbers with extra endings. This is true of all ordinal numbers after 10th, too.

=====Road terms=====
Now that you know the Turkish metric system and how to say Turkish ordinal numbers, let's learn the necessary vocab required.

*'''yol''' - road
*'''trafik''' - traffic 
*'''taşıma''' - transport
*'''sokak / cadde''' - street / avenue
*'''bulvar''' - boulevard
*'''meydan''' - (town) square (''meydan'' literally means ''open space'', but can be translated as ''square'').
*'''kestirme (yolu)''' - shortcut
*'''otoban''' - highway
*'''otoyol''' - motorway
*'''şose''' - macadam
*'''bisiklet yolu''' - bicycle path
*'''raylar''' - rails
*'''tünel''' - tunnel
*'''köprü''' - bridge
*'''viyadük''' - viaduct
*'''kaldırım''' - pavement(it's a little bit confusing because it can also mean footpath)
*'''patika''' - footpath
*'''kavşak''' - junction
*'''trafik ışıkları''' - traffic light
*'''yol işaretleri''' - road signs
*'''araba''' - car
*'''tren''' - train 
*'''tramvay''' - tram 
*'''otobüs''' - bus
*'''uçak''' - airplane
*'''helikopter''' - helicopter
*'''bisiklet''' - bicycle
*'''motosiklet''' - motorcycle
*'''taksi''' - taxi
*'''gemi''' - boat
*'''feribot''' - ferry
*'''otobüs durağı''' - bus stop
*'''demiryolu''' - railroad

===Getting to the point...===
[[Image:Grand Bazaar 03.JPG|right|275px|thumb|The hustle and bustle of Kapalicarsi, Istanbul. But in other areas, it's even more crowded!]]
Well, I bet you're thinking, ''&quot;Geez, it's about time!&quot;'''. Well yes, but at least you've learnt all that's necessary in asking for directions. Now let's look at a typical conversation between '''t'''ourist and '''s'''tranger:

'''T''': Ben müzeye nasıl gidebilirim?

'''S''': İleri git, ve sağ tarafına dön. İkinci trafik ışığında sola döndüğünde meydanı görürsün. Karşıya gittiğinde, bulvarda yüz metre ileri sonra müzeyi bulursunuz.

'''T''': Çok teşekkürler!

'''S''': Birşey değil.

Did you understand that? Didn't you? Either way, take a look at one of the boxes towards the bottom of the page for the translation of this conversation.

==Review==
So what have we learnt this lesson? We have learnt:
*Some grammar (adding ''a'', ''e'', etc. to the end of nouns).
*Different ways of asking for directions.
*How to say certain directions in Turkish.
*How to say the units of the metric system in Turkish.
*Turkish ordinal numbers.
*Certain Turkish road terms.
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY
*How to ask for directions!

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://www.kilgray.com/kilgray/products/memoq?locale=en MemoQ] is an integrated localization/translation environment that optimizes the productivity of translation and localization. In the MemoQ ILE, all translation resources are only a mouse-click away resulting in an ergonomy never seen before.

MemoQ is designed to provide an optimal environment for translators and project managers, with useless keystrokes and file operations eliminated. It is a one-stop environment with every tool integrated in the most transparent manner.

MemoQ is an easy-to-use concept-oriented system. Although the look and feel is somewhat similar to that of [[CAT-Tools/DéjàVu X|Déjà Vu]], things like a semi-WYSIWYG translation grid, access to remote translation memories and term bases, a cutting-edge aligner and homogeneity analysis in the statistics module make it match the older brother.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==
* 4 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* Spices:
** 6 whole [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom pods]] (use only the seeds, discard the shells)
** 2 tsp whole [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seeds]] (it's not too strong, so use plenty)
** ⅛ tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
** ¼ tsp whole [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
** 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
** 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped (increase spices if using lots more onion, otherwise the taste is weak)
* 2 lb fryer, or [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] parts (OPTIONAL: substitute [[Cookbook:Tofu|firm tofu]] for the chicken.)
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]] (or 1 cup plain [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]] &amp; ½ cup sour cream)
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Currant|currants]] (or [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]], if currants are unavailable)
===Optional extras:===
* ¼-⅓ cup [[Cookbook:Almond|slivered almonds]] (toasted if you prefer)
* 2 tbsp shredded (or chipped) [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]] (also toasted)

==Procedure==
# Heat oil until quite hot (not smoking.)
# Add spices and bay leaf. Cook until seeds crack. (1-2 minutes.)
# Reduce heat.
# Add garlic and onion. Cook until tender &amp; translucent.
# Reserve onion, garlic &amp; spices into a side dish.
# Season chicken with salt &amp; pepper. Roll in flour.
# Fry chicken. (Add oil if needed.)
# When chicken is almost done, add reserved onion/spice mixture.
# Add currants.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; At this point, chicken may be cooled &amp; frozen.
# To serve, add sour cream (or mixture of sour cream and yogurt) and simmer until chicken is tender and sauce has cooked down a little.
# Serve with [[Cookbook:Saffron Sweet Rice|Saffron Sweet Rice]]

==Notes==
*After cooking, the spices continue to infuse the chicken and mellow the flavor. Refrigerating this dish for a day then warming it, enhances its flavor!

==Ingredients==
* 1½ cup [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (we prefer basmati over plain)
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* large scoop (⅛ tsp) [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron]] (expensive but worth it!)
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] (or [[Cookbook:Currant|currants]])
* ¼-½ cup [[Cookbook:Almond|slivered almonds]] (toasted if you prefer)

==Procedure==
# Wash rice and add enough water cover rice with water equal to the depth of the rice.
# Add salt, saffron, sugar &amp; raisins.
# Cook over high heat until water disappears and steam is rising from holes in the surface of the rice.
# Reduce heat to warm.
# Add almonds.
# Cover tightly and let stand for 20 minutes.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* For diabetics, you may replace sugar with 4 to 6 packets of SPLENDA sweetner.
* Saffron Sweet Rice is a nice complement to [[Cookbook:Amar's Chicken|Amar's Chicken]] and [[Cookbook:Amar's Tofu|Amar's Tofu]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">To begin programming, you will require the following.

#[http://education.ti.com/us/product/main.html Calculator]: a TI-82, TI-83x, TI-84x, TI-85, or TI-86 or newer model.
#[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/15/1504.html TASM]: This program &quot;assembles&quot; the assembly code you will write to code that the computer understands.
#[http://www.useyourtime.frihost.net/files/Include.zip TI-83 Plus Include File]: this text file assists TASM by giving it necessary information when assembling.
#[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/129/12922.html DevPac8x]: this program changes the code that TASM has assembled into a file that you can transfer to your calculator.
#[http://education.ti.com/us/resources/developer/83/hilight/hilight.html TI SDK]: also known as the TI 83 Plus Flash Debugger, this program allows programs to be tested on the computer for errors without having to transfer them to the calculator.
#[http://education.ti.com/us/product/accessory/connectivity/features/cables.html Link]: this will allow you to transfer your programs to the calculator from the computer.

Now that you have everything, you will need to set up the environment so that everything works together.  It is highly advisable to follow examples given.

# Make a folder where you will put all of your Assembly files (e.g. C:\ASM).
# Unzip the TASM files into a subfolder of ASM titled 'TASM' (e.g. C:\ASM\TASM).
# Put 'ti83plus.inc' into your TASM folder.
# Unzip the DevPac8x files into a subfolder of ASM titled 'devpac8x' (e.g. C:\ASM\devpac8x).
# Make another subfolder of ASM titled 'Programs' (e.g. C:\ASM\Programs).  This folder will be where all of your programs will be placed.
# Install the TI SDK.
# Open Notepad and type the following:

 @echo off
 echo Compiling...
 move %1.z80 ..\tasm
 cd ..\tasm
 tasm -t80 -i -b %1.z80 %1.bin
 move %1.z80 ..\programs
 move %1.bin ..\devpac8x
 cd ..\devpac8x
 devpac8x %1
 move %1.bin ..\programs
 move %1.8xp ..\programs
 cd ..\programs
 echo Done!

Save this as 'compile.bat' into your Programs folder.  Make sure to set 'Save as type:' to 'All files' or it will save as 'compile.bat.txt'.

Now, just verify that you know how to use the link and turn on your calculator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Spoilers ==

A big part of the gimmick in Chamber of Secrets is that Tom Marvolo Riddle turns out to be Lord Voldemort. Because of that, I feel it is best to move that revelation into the protected area. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 19:07, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
:To reinforce this, I should point out that T. Riddle's being Voldemort is a spoiler for CoS, and so is why Riddle has a separate page from Voldemort. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 06:10, 30 July 2012 (UTC)

=== A reminder to editors ===

The framework lays out where the various spoiler entries are. There should be at least some of the entry for a character that can be read without spoilers, which means that the overview, the only such section, must perforce be very limited in what it tells us.

A recent editor added a bunch of stuff to the overview, then felt he had to put a spoiler warning in front of it. I reverted him, and moved his information down to the analysis area where it more properly belongs, given its spoiler nature.

== Voldemort a Nazi? ==

Relevance of the last paragraph is questionable, especially since little reference is made to real-world 'Muggle' politics or history in the book series. [[User:84.0.217.93|84.0.217.93]] 01:36, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
:The thing is that to a certain sort of psychopath, the Nazi &quot;solution&quot; seems like an ideal way to strengthen a race, by &quot;purifying&quot; it. Voldemort is portrayed as being that sort of individual. Granted that there is no mention of it in the series, it is still the sort of idea that would appeal to young Tom, and actually does seem to mirror his actions afterwards. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:05, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
::I will additionally mention that in an interview, Rowling did mention that the defeat by Dumbledore of the black magician Grindelwald had some bearing on the end of the second world war. So events in the Muggle world may be downplayed in the Wizarding world, but the wizards are not unaffected by what happens to us non-magical folk. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:21, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
:::Okay, well the reason I got rid of this section was that Riddle only 11 when WWII started and 23 when it ended, at which time, he was working at Borgin's And Burke's; he would have been too engrossed looking for new Horcruxes and letting the Ministry Of Magic (I hate the word &quot;For&quot;) take care of Grindelwald. If Grindelwald has a page, I strongly suggest this topic being used on his page; it is irrelevant on Voldemort's page. Apologies--[[User:Therequiembellishere|Therequiembellishere]] 00:36, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
::::We sort of have decided that Riddle was born in the 1926/27 timeframe, which would make him 12 and in his second year at Hogwarts when hostilities broke out, and probably 18 or so on V-E day. I do not believe, and have never suggested, that Tom was in the armed forces of either England or Germany; I agree that he was too young. But we see in HBP that he is already strongly prejudiced against Muggles, to the point of (in, probably, 1944 or so) killing his own father because he happens to be a Muggle. To someone who already harbours that sort of prejudice, to that extreme an extent, the ideas of the National Socialist party would resonate extremely strongly; and I can't help thinking that he was already so far biased in that direction that he would have incorporated the &quot;final solution to the Muggle problem&quot; in his thinking, and have been acting accordingly ever since. In that time frame, it is not a matter of actions but of impressions. And I don't think we know enough about Grindelwald to have a page about him; we have one line on a Famous Wizards card and a throwaway comment in an interview, and that's it. So even if we made such a page, there wouldn't be enough of a hook to hang it on there. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 08:18, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
:::::Well, yeah, he loves the idea of killing Muggles, but to be a Nazi, he'd have had to work ''with'' Muggles; something he see as repulsive. [[User:Therequiembellishere|Therequiembellishere]] 16:57, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
::::::It seems I am being misunderstood. Voldemort is not a Nazi. He never was. He has no hate on for Jewish people or Gypsies. What he sees is a concept: &quot;some people are naturally better than others, so to improve the species, wipe out the inferiors.&quot; To some people, this sort of &quot;solution&quot; has an appealing simplicity. To one as twisted as Voldemort, and as powerful, it can seem like the ideal answer. It is this underlying philosophy, rather than the specific trappings of the Nazi party, that would attract Voldemort. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:46, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
:::::::killing his own father might be because he happens to be a Muggle or because his father abandond him and his mother before tom was born, but to get an apporpret reasponce to that we would have to understand his (voldemorts) mind which is some only -may be even not- that J.K Rowling could do -- [[User:Elizabeth113|Elizabeth113]] ([[User talk:Elizabeth113|discuss]]) 22:27, 9 April 2012 (UTC)
::::::::True, it likely was not simply because he was a Muggle. But that was certainly a large part of it -- he was a Muggle. and he denied Tom Jr. what he saw as his birthright -- domination of the world. But a large part of it must have been because Riddle Sr. is a Muggle and therefore beneath contempt... and Tom Jr. would have hated the fact that Riddle Sr. being a Muggle made him a half-breed. We know already that Tom hated his own name... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:11, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

== Spellcheck ==

Just started using Firefox 2.0, and I find it amusing that the suggestion its spellchecker makes for Voldemort is &quot;demoralizer&quot;... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:51, 17 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

{{miskito_comment|We can also use other tenses of '''kaia''' to form the corresponding negative tenses. However, the auxiliary '''kaia''' may be omitted leaving just the ''-ras''-form; the intended person and tense must then be inferred from the context.}}
{{miskito_note|Remember: '''kaia''' itself has no ''-ras''-form; '''apia''' is placed in front of the the affirmative forms to make them negative: '''apia sna/sma/sa'''. The same holds for compounds with '''kaia''' such as '''want kaia, nu kaia''' etc.: '''want apia sna''' and so on.}}

{{miskito_comment|As for the past tense, for now we shall limit ourselves to the third person, which as we know ends in '''-an''' in most verbs: '''pulan, atkan, kaikan''' etc. This may be called the simple past. There is also a compound past tense, the imperfect, formed by placing the past tense of '''kaia''' ('''kan''' in the third person) after the ''i''-participle: '''pul''i kan'', atk''i kan'', kaik''i kan'''''.}}
{{miskito_note|The ''i''-form of verbs is already familiar to you as the base of the present tense of regular verbs, so if you remove the ending '''-sa''' from the present '''puli''sa''''' what you are left with is the verb's ''i''-form: '''puli'''.}}

{{miskito_comment|The imperfect can often be translated by ''was playing, was buying'' etc. (or by the imperfect tense in Spanish, French etc., if you know a Romance language: thus '''puli kan''' is equivalent to ''jugaba, jouait'' and so on). The imperfect usually expresses an ongoing activity whereas the simple past expresses a specific act.}}
{{miskito_comment|The negative past is formed as you would now expect: the verb's ''-ras''-form plus the past of '''kaia''' ('''kan''' in the third person): '''pulras kan'''. But once again, the auxiliary may be omitted: '''pulras'''.}}
{{miskito_note|Compound ''kaia''-verbs ('''want kaia, nu kaia''' etc.) form the past, as we would expect, using the past of '''kaia''', e.g. '''want kan''' ''wanted'', '''nu kan''' ''knew'', '''want apia kan''' ''didn't want'' etc.}}

==Usage==
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{print version cover}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

Creates a substitute for [[Wikibooks:Title pages|book cover]] for books, which don't have a separate page with it (for example, [[C Programming]]).

You can supply another title as an optional argument (for example, &quot;Comprehensive guide to C Programming&quot; instead of &quot;C Programming&quot;):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{print version cover|Comprehensive guide to C Programming}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

When there is no separate page listing authors and list of main authors is short, you can use optional &quot;authors&quot; argument:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{print version cover|authors=John Smith, Jim Bean}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

Books having separate page for cover should use {{tl|print version cover text}} template.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This arbitration will follow the process defined in [[Wikibooks:Resolving disputes|Resolving disputes]]. During this process uncivil behavior will '''not''' be tolerated. Each party will have their own individual personal statements page and only they and arbiters will make content edits on that page. Efforts should be made to resolve disputes quickly, however time extensions may be granted depending on circumstances. The arbiters have the right to suspend proceedings or issue a final decision summarily at any time should they decide it necessary. 

Interested members of the community can comment on the process and suggest remedies at the [[/Community discussion/]] page. 

All decisions by the arbiters will be considered final. There is no appeal. The decision will be recorded on the [[/Decision summary/]] page.

==Scope of arbitration== 
The arbiters are given a wide-ranging ability to make judgments, proscribe activities, and enact remedies related to this dispute. Remedies can include everything from informal advice to formal censure all the way up to lifetime bans and removal of other privileges. 

===Questions to be decided=== 
These questions are at the heart of this dispute. 
* Question 1
* Question 2
* Question 3
* Question 4
* ...

===Involved parties===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Greatest NCAA football game in Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball History==

Every year for the past 3 years, players from the Boston Boys Fantasy Baseball league go over to Bread and Butter's house to play video games on the the greatest halfday of the school year. Before the games even started, The Godfather and Pork Fried rice were already getting pumped up about their BC vs. VT game (Later known as the greatest game ever on Paul Revere Road.) Pork Fried Rice and The Godfather are huge rivals when it comes to college sports. Fried Rice, a VT fan always makes fun at The Godfather A BC fan.
The Godfather was getting very tired how fried rice would always talk about how much better VT is then BC. After the scrumptious meal at Kens, the showdown occurred. Fried rice, a well known 360 NCAA football player was the favorite because he had the game, the system, and the better recored in head to head meetings. When the game started, everyone was amazed how The Godfather was destroying Fried Rice by over 21 points. It was almost an easy win. However it didn't take long for Fried Rice to understand how to use the really good defense VT is known for. One thing lead to another and he went ahead. For the rest of the game, it was neck and neck. One would score then the other, and so. 
Finally with little more than a minute left, Fried Rice was having an amazing drive down field. The next thing you know, he was in field goal range. All fried rice had to do was spike it and kick the 36 yard field goal. However thinking it was too far of a shot he decided to make one more run play. (This play will forever go down as the greatest play in NCAA football history.)

Fried Rice got the great snap, and decided to instead throw the ball, run will the QB to the left side. The QB was running fast he was already in easy field goal range, but he kept going. With only only one person infront of him, the game was pretty much over. The Godfather had one last shot, so he decided to hit stick the QB. 

Al Michaels with the Call &quot;Cory Holt drops back to pass, he scrambles to the left, hes got running room. Hes at the 30, now the 25 Alex Albright hits him hard, THE BALLS LOSE, BC got the ball with plenty of running room. BC's at the 30 the 40, the 50, NO ONES LEF TO BEAT. HES AT THE 20 the 10, DO U BELIEVE IN MIRACLES YESSSSSS!!!!&quot;

So with little time left, the Godfather hit sticked Fried Rice, and holt fumbled the ball. Once BC picked it up, the rest was history.

This Game will go down as one of the greatest for not just that one play, but for How Fried Rice never gave up and came back after trailing by over 21 points at the half.

'''Chicken and Corn Empanadas'''&lt;br&gt;
''Empanadas, which come from the Spanish word for &quot;bread,&quot; are baked or fried turnovers made from bread, pastry, phyllo, or even pizza dough. Find out why empanadas, the Spanish hand-held meal-in-a-pocket, are enjoyed from Buenos Aires to Miami!''

==Ingredients==

* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Use rotisserie-roasted chicken.
* Oso Sweet onions are the winter sweet onion from Chile, in season from January to March. They have record-high sugar content, crisp texture, and mild flavor.
* Vidalias would be a reasonable onion substitute if Oso Sweet onions cannot be found.
* You can use this as a base to experiment with any filling or combination you desire.

== Overview ==

'''''Potions''''' is the science of combining ordinary and magical substances to create potions, (usually) liquids with magical effects.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Not everything discussed in Potions class is, strictly speaking, a liquid. Several sections of the class are concerned with antidotes, and on a number of occasions there is mention of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bezoar|Bezoar]], a stone found in a goat's stomach, which has curative properties.

There are a very large number of potions mentioned through the course of the seven books. Of these, perhaps the most important are the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wolfsbane Potion|Wolfsbane potion]], which appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]], which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] first introduces us to in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], and which is then used in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis]], which plays a large role in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']].

Potions is taught for the first five years of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s schooling by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], and in the sixth and seventh year by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]].

== Analysis ==

Magic potions play a large role in Muggle ideas about magic, so it is clearly necessary that they should be a part of the Wizarding world. Their being codified and formalized into almost a science seems only proper, given what we have come to understand about them.

It is necessary for the development of Harry's character that he should not excel in all subjects, and in fact only in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] does Harry consistently perform to the top of his ability, when allowed to. However, particularly in Potions, Harry does not work up to the level that we expect of him. Certainly, some of this is due to unfair marking of assignments by Snape, who we see as having a bias against Gryffindor house in general, and against Harry in particular.  

''&quot;...and was pleased to find that when left alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily.&quot;'' —Harry's opinion on how easy it was to brew the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL-level]] potion

Only later in Harry's magical education does his true ability at Potions show when he is only one of twelve students able to make it to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT-level]], having achieved &quot;Exceeds Expectations&quot; on his OWL exam. It is noted that Harry has few problems with potions as long as Snape is not around.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

For the first five years, Potions is inextricably tied up with Professor Snape, and Harry's performance in that course is clearly influenced by Snape's dislike of Harry. A large part of Harry's difficulty with Potions lies in Snape's trying to force Harry into the same mold as his father, and Harry's unconscious resistance to that. In one particular case, we see that Harry's failure to correctly make a potion is due to Snape's having written the instructions on the board in a way that would cause confusion in any reader. It is clear to the reader that Snape is trying to make Harry fail, and does not care if he dooms the entire Gryffindor class at the same time.

It is noteworthy that, given a fair teacher (Slughorn) and a good instructor (the &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;'s book), Harry is capable of turning in an excellent job in Potions class, and even absent the book he is still able to do a decent enough job of it that Slughorn's suspicions are not raised. It should also perhaps be noted that Harry's mother is singled out by Slughorn as one of the best Potion students he had ever had.

| When adding dates to the end of recordings, where one already exists with the same name, could you force it to do the first one too? Ie add the date to every file. I say this because, when transferring to PC/DVD, I often delete them on the Toppy. Then the next recording doesn't have a date on it and it's not easy to see which order they go in, when compared to the episodes I've already recorded. 

I don't think I've explained that very well, but I think you'll get the idea. It'd be great to have the option to '''add a date suffix to EVERY recording filename'''. [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=68549#68549 chrispayze]
| .
| Implemented in next version. [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=94038#94038 chunkywizard]
|-
| How about '''anything with a Film Genre goes in a folder called Films''' (or configurable folder)? I suspect that most of users have a Films folder, and it would be nice if the one time record timers set from the EPG for a film moved the .rec to said folder automatically. [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=69101#69101 jondurant]
| .
| We considered that (or something similar) at the point we added automove &amp; autofile, but we decided against it (can't remember why!). I expect it is something that we will put in at some point, once we decide how flexible to make it (ie we could just do as you describe, or we could allow you to have some control over where it goes)
|-
| If all 70 timer slots are in use other TAPs can't set timers, '''can MS limit the number of timers it uses''' [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=81743#81743 ichilton]
| .
| We may consider adding the max to set as an option then at some point (maybe for the next version, maybe not). Just setting it to 60 would be too many for some people and too few for others.
|- style=&quot;background:#CCFFCC;&quot;
| The '''merging of same channel consecutive timers''' into one timer. 

British TV like British Rail never runs on time, it's why we pad our recording timers in the first place, so removing padding to accommodate a second timer is not always the best choice. 

A global menu setting for manual timers set in the EPG could give three choices, 'never' merge timers, 'always' merge timers and 'ask', which would generate a dialog much like that in EPG Navigator, asking the user whether to keep the timers separate or merge them. A global menu setting for CT timers could only realistically have two options 'never' and 'always'. 

Please consider this feature, more than a few times now, I have found that the last two minutes of a recording I am watching with interest, are on the first two minutes of a recording I watched and deleted the day before. [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=94062#94062 Snapper]

| Programs on the commercial channels almost always finish a few minutes early to fit in some adverts, but the next program than still often starts a minute early. On the BBC it's somewhat similar with all the trailers and previews. Therefore it would make sense to '''split consecutive programs at e.g. 20:59 rather than 21:00'''.

| When I open the EPG, select Channel 4 (for example) and press 'right' repeatedly, I get an effect I'd rather not. On some shows the screen doesn't scroll enough to the right to show the programme's 'bar'. For example, at the moment (I guess it'll change later tonight), if I do as described, the 'Friday Night Project' first shows up as a sliver on the extreme right of the screen rather than the whole 'bar' of the programme being displayed. If I continue on, 'The Album Chart Show' also gives the same effect. 

Wouldn't it be better to '''scroll the EPG screen enough to show the whole 'bar''''?

| At the moment you can choose &quot;Current(M)&quot; to bring up the EPG centered (roughly) on the current channel. Probably code something like taking the current channel index C in the favourites list, EPG size N (rows) and showing channel indices (C-N/2+1) to (C+N/2) in the EPG (bounded appropriately). 

What I'd like to suggest is a '''paged view of the EPG list''', so you see the EPG with channel indices 0 to 7 if you're on any of those channels, 8 to 15 if you're on any of those, etc. With code something like: show channel indices (floor(C/N)*N) to (floor(C/N)*N+N-1). 

The benefit is relatively few EPG channel arrangements are presented to the user, making it more predictable. And you could neatly group your channels into suitable themed pages-- i.e., kids channels for when watching with them, entertainment channels for when watching with the OH, and other channels for when desperate to just watch any old rubbish.

| Sounds like a good idea - I'd probably use this if it was available. I'm a great lover of consistency and predictability ... which is why I've got the EPG set to have &quot;First channel in file&quot; at the top of the display. However, this IS is a bit disorientating when the first page doesn't include the channel you're watching. In a 1-11, 12-22, (etc.) grouping, the highlight of the current programme would make it easy to locate the current channel (as it does now if I'm watching one of the first 11). 

In my case, it's rare for me to be watching channels other than the first 11, so a fixed top of page is currently the best option, as I have the maximum number of channels showing and my favourite favourite channels are at the top of the file. However, the addition of Radio Channels to the end of my default favourites list could make the fixed page group approach even more appealing and relevant (even if I have to cheat in the favourites file to get good groupings of 11 channels ).

Possibly... 

Timers are deleted anything up to around 5 minutes after their start time by the standard Toppy housekeeping routines. So we can't use that data. So we'd just need to check which data set is used to populate the recording Archive and see if that's suitable for display in the Timer view too. 

What you can't do from the TAP API is then adjust the timer data for an ongoing recording. You have to use the in-built Toppy pop-up when you press Record outside of any osd. So for that reason, it might be better to not display it at all. Since it could well spawn more questions here than it solves as a feature request. 

We'll let you know what we find.[http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=100930#100930 HydeTheDarkerSide]
when a timer has fired it is no longer a timer really hence why it is shown in the recording list! If you wish to show timers and recordings in one view I use the Grid EPG which is good for seeing clashes. [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=100933#100933 chunkywizard]

| What you mean by the request makes perfect sense (and would stop me getting an ear bashing when House doesn't get recorded too!) I'll leave it to BobD for input on whether it's achievable. I suspect it would take a lot of work for a relatively small return, as CTs work by searching ahead through the EPG info, and they have no concept of a repeat interval. If the EPG has never been there, then there's never been anything to find. 

You could always set a non-CT weekly timer  ... and then we get back into the debate about relative priorities for one-shot timers vs CTs, as you'd presumably want the CT to take priority over the one-shot when EPG information IS available (i.e. most of the time), and only fire if the EPG data was missing.

The problem with setting &quot;once per week&quot; is that you don't know what the frequency will be when the series returns, especially those that give you episode 1 &amp; 2 on the same day and then settle into some sort of pattern after that. That's one of the reasons for the Exclude feature, until a pattern can be established.

==Introduction to Finance==

Finance is a field of study of the relationship of three things; time, risk and money.

The Time Value of Money is one of three fundamental ideas that shape finance.

The Time Value of Money explains why, &quot;A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow&quot;. This is primarily due to the market for loanable funds and inflation. If someone has a dollar today then they also have the opportunity to loan/invest that dollar at some interest rate. Therefore, a dollar today in time t, would be worth $1.00 plus some interest rate, i. That is more than a dollar by itself in the future.  An example for inflation would be, let's say you have $1 and you can buy 10 candies today. For the same 10 candies tomorrow you have to pay $1.20. So, due to inflation for the ''same'' 10 candies ''today you pay less'' than ''you would pay tomorrow'' 

''Inflation refers to the decrease in the purchasing power. Deflation refers to the increase in the purchasing power. In layman terms, inflation causes not the value of money to decrease but the amount of consumables/items that you can now purchase to decline in quantity. Look at the example above. $1 is still $1 but after inflation the individual can probably buy only 8 candies for the same $1 amount.'' 

There are two values of money. One is the Present Value of Money and the other is the Future Value of Money. 

Second is the concept of &quot;opportunity cost&quot;; i.e. if a person deploys his money on one item or investment then he has given up the opportunity to do something else with it. 

Third is the concept of risk. Let us say, I have earmarked $10,000 towards investments and I decide that I will invest in Microsoft. I put all my money in Microsoft(MSFT) all $10,000 of it. As on 5th Oct., 2006 each share of Microsoft trades at $27.94. So, I would be able to purchase 357.91 shares of MSFT. My returns are completely dependent on how MSFT stock performs in the market and this means that if a Microsoft product(i.e. Vista), fails in the marketplace, MSFT stock goes tumbling down and reduces my investment in MSFT. 

Thus, Risk can be defined as the probability of my investment eroding its own self.

In equity, the risk factor is higher than in debt financing and hence as an investor I look for equity to give me higher returns as I have taken higher risk. If I buy US Treasury notes for that value, the investment is almost risk free as the US Govt. stands to guarantee it and hence the return (typically, expressed as the rate of interest) is low. The difference between the returns from equity and from debt(US Treasury, etc) is the Risk Premium.

Risk Premium is the reward given to an investor to take more risk.

===Return on Investments===

The concept of a return on investment is designed to balance all three perils.  In finance there are actually two returns: the '''return ''of'' investment''' and the '''return ''on'' investment'''.  If the investment loses money, you may be able to recover a portion of what you risked.  A return ''on'' investment (hereafter &quot;'''ROI'''&quot;, or &quot;'''return'''&quot;) is the return that finance is primarily concerned with although the other cannot be overlooked.  It implies first and foremost a 100% return ''of'' investment.  In order to do so, the return must therefore

# replace the buying power lost to inflation,
# make up for and exceed the losses from other financing activities, and
# make the investment more attractive to someone than any other option, including spending the money.

Item 3 can be as objective as selecting the best ROI among many or it can be as subjective and personal as whether or not to give up the satisfaction of having dessert every night for a month.  Regardless if the investor does not perceive sufficient potential for gain, the money will never change hands.

==='''Debt Finance and Equity Finance - The Two Pillars of Modern Finance'''===

Financing activity for most ventures are either '''debt financing''' or '''equity financing'''.  

Once an investor has decided to engage in financing any business venture or project, he has three concerns to address: risk, protective claim, and return.

These three concerns are essentially hierarchical.  The latter two depend on and counterbalance with the first.  Higher risk is only attractive when associated with higher returns.  The protective claim then acts like a fulcrum to fine tune the balance between risk and return.

====Debt Financing====
Debt financing.  In this mode money is borrowed, and usually the borrower (debtor) gives the lender (creditor) a promisory note. This, usually, obligated the debtor to pay back a certain defined amount at a particular and defined time in the future.

Forms of debt financing can include credit cards, mortgages, signature loans, bonds, IOUs, and HELOCs (Home Equity Lines of Credit) as examples. Treasury debt, savings bonds, corporate bonds are also forms of debt financing.

With debt financing, the creditor's return is fixed and understandable.  It is, quite simply, the agreed upon interest rate for the debt.  This rate can vary from a single digit rate to 25% or perhaps even 30% depending on the debtor.  Risk is determined by a handful of factors the most significant usually being one's credit history.  The protective claim offered to creditors in debt financing is a claim on the debtor's ''assets''.  Should the debtor fail to repay, the creditor may forcibly take possession of other debtor property and sell it, using the money to offset the loss of the loan.  The claim of creditors takes priority over the claim of those who participate in equity financing.

====Equity Financing====
Equity financing is generally considered less certain than debt financing.  Equity financing is also typically where non-cash assets such as equipment, skills, and land are invested alongside regular cash.  This is the category in which we also find venture capital, shares of stock, angel investors, and more. The terms that are used to describe the equity financing relationship are more varied and, as such, will be simply dubbed equity investors.  Later on, more proper names will be provided which, for the time being, are immaterial.

The return of equity financing is the claim on a business's ''profits''; not just today's profits, but in modern companies that issue stock, all future potential profits as well.  For this reason, i.e. because most personal finance does not involve the debtor making a profit, almost all of personal finance is debt financing.  The exceptions will be noted shortly.

While it's true that in equity financing, the equity investor still has some claim on the business' assets, the creditor's prior claim renders this point moot from a practical standpoint.  What protection, then, is offered for equity financing? The claim to ''management rights''. As an equity investor, with a few notable exceptions, you are granted the right to do everything in your personal power along with the other equity investors to make sure that the business goes in a profitable direction.

===Ratio Analysis===
Ratio analysis is one core theme of business finance. To understand the concept of ratio analysis we must know that there are five basic types of ratio analysis.
# Liquidity Ratio
# Activity Ratio
# Debt Ratio 
# Profitability Ratio
# Markets Ratio. 

Now we discuss one by one the impacts of these ratios on the business and their implementation in the business environment.

====Liquidity Ratios====
In liquidity ratio analysis there are two types of ratios:
*Current Ratio
* Quick (Acid-Test) Ratio.

=====Current Ratio=====
Current Ratio shows how many $1 of current assets are available for paying $1 of current liabilities of the company, firm or organization. As some financial analysts suggests that the more current assets that are available to the company, the better. But in some cases, a high current ratio may indicate too much inventory or too much in prepaid or other current assets. It could also indicate idle cash, and as a result, a poor investment strategy. A current ratio that is high is not as bad as one that is low, however a high current ratio is an indication that financial policies either do not exist or are not being implemented. A low or declining current ratio is always bad. It is an indicator of rising current liabilities and declining current assets. A current ratio of 1 or less is an indication of insolvency. Further declines in the ratio could trigger collection actions on the part of creditors and send the company into bankruptcy.

=====Quick (Acid-Test) Ratio===== 
The quick ratio is calculated by dividing cash by current liabilities. This is the true test of a companies ability to pay its debts. A high current ratio and a low quick ratio could indicate too much is invested in inventory or other current assets, assets that are not very liquid and therefore could not be depended on to pay current liabilities. An increase in inventory could be a signal that sales have fallen, production has slowed and management should take action to prevent any damage to the financial condition of the company.
Both ratios should be analyzed together to get the correct picture of the companies financial health.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The goal of this project is to create a book or a series of books that could be used to educate children about processes and technologies that can improve the lives of people in poor or disadvantaged communities, while respecting their local environment.

When working on this project, remember that it is aimed at children. It must be simple and easily understood while being quite accurate. Use technical vocabulary when you need to, but don't use big words where simpler language would work. The goal of this project is to create a book or a series of books that could be used to educate children about the processes that can improve the lives of people from poor or disadvantaged communities, while respecting their local environment.

== &quot;Rural&quot; &quot;UnderDeveloped&quot; &quot;Poor&quot; ? ==

Just a suggestion: There are significant efforts underway in &quot;Developed&quot; countries such as the USA, based on Rural environments and Rural concerns.  Many of the Technologies developed in an earlier era (and now being re-developed and improved)are directly applicable to other &quot;Rural&quot; environments. This is especially true in the Energy area.  Many efforts, such as efficient cook stoves and wood-powered engines for irrigation and electricity generation, are international efforts.  So perhaps this subject could include efforts in 'developed' countries, as appropriate..

The '''Eastern Tent Caterpillar''' (''Malacosoma americanum'') is a social species of caterpillar that forms communal nests in the branches of trees. It is sometimes confused with the gypsy moth (''[[../Lymantria dispar/]]''), or the fall webworm and may be erroneously referred to as a bagworm which is the common name applied to unrelated caterpillars in the family Psychidae. The moths oviposit almost exclusively on trees in the plant family Rosaceae, particularly cherries (Prunus) and apple (Malus). The caterpillars are hairy with areas of blue, white, black and orange. The blue and white colors are mechanical colors created by the selective filtering of light by microtubules that arise on the cuticle.

In terms of complexity of interactions, the eastern tent caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum, stands near the pinnacle of caterpillar sociality. The adult moth lays her eggs in a single batch in late spring or early summer. The egg masses contain on average 200-300 eggs. Embryogenesis proceeds rapidly and within three weeks fully formed caterpillars can be found within the eggs. But the small caterpillars lie quiescent until the following spring, chewing their way through the shells of their eggs just as the buds of the host tree begins to expand.

The newly hatched caterpillars initiate the construction of a silk tent soon after emerging. They typically aggregate at the tent site for the whole of their larval life, expanding the tent each day to accommodate their increasing size. Under field conditions, the caterpillars feed three times each day, just before dawn, in the evening after sunset, and at mid afternoon. During each bout of feeding the caterpillars emerge from the tent, add silk to the structure, move to distant feeding sites en masse, feed, then return immediately to the tent where they rest until the next activity period. The exception to this pattern occurs in the last instar when the caterpillars feed only at night. The caterpillars lay down pheromone trails to guide their movements between the tent and feeding sites. The insect has six larval instars. When fully grown, the caterpillars disperse and construct cocoons in protected places. The adults emerge about two weeks later. Mating and oviposition typically occur on the same day as the moths emerge from their cocoons and being completely spent the females die soon thereafter.

The tent of the eastern tent caterpillar is among the largest built by any tent caterpillar. The tents are constructed in the crotch of the host tree and are typically oriented so that the broadest face of the structure faces the southeast, taking advantage of the morning sun. The caterpillars typically add silk to the structure at the onset of each of their daily activity periods. Silk is added directly to the surface of the tent as the caterpillars walk back and forth over the structure. The silk is laid down under slight tension and it eventually contracts, causing the newly spun layer of silk to separate from the previously spun layer. The tent thus consists of discrete layers separated by gaps within which the caterpillars rest. The tent has openings that allow the caterpillars to enter and exit the structure. Openings are formed where branches jut from the structure but are most common at the apex of the tent.

Light has a great effect on the caterpillars while they are spinning and they always spin the majority of their silk on the most illuminated face of the tent. Indeed, if under experimental conditions the dominant light source is directed at the tent from below, the caterpillars will build their tent upside down. Caterpillars continue to expand their tent until they enter the last phase of their larval life. The sixth-instar caterpillar conserves its silk for cocoon construction and adds nothing to the tent. The tents are multifunctional. They facilitate basking, offer some protection from enemies, provide for secure purchase, and act as a staging site from which the caterpillars launch en masse forays to distant feeding sites. The elevated humidity inside the tent may facilitate molting.

Eastern tent caterpillars are among the earliest of caterpillars to appear in the spring. Because the early spring weather is often cold, the caterpillars rely on the heat of the sun to elevate their body temperatures to levels that allow them to digest their food. Studies show that below 15°C (59°F) the caterpillars are unable to process the food in their guts. Early instars of the tent caterpillar are black and their bodies readily absorb the rays of the sun. When basking, the caterpillars typically pack together tightly, reducing heat loss due to convective currents. The long setae that occur on the caterpillars also serve to stem convective heat loss. The caterpillars may aggregate on the surface of the tent or within the structure. The tents act as miniature glass houses, trapping the heat of the morning sun and allowing the caterpillars to warm more quickly than they would if they remained outside the tent. Studies have shown that basking, aggregated caterpillars can achieve temperature excesses of as much as 44°C. Indeed, the caterpillars can easily overheat and they must take evasive action when they become too hot.

Because of its layered structure, the tent is thermally heterogeneous and the caterpillars can adjust their temperature by moving from layer to layer. The caterpillars may also aggregate on the outside of the shaded side of the tent and hang from the tips of their abdomens to enhance convective heat loss and cooling.

As shown for some other caterpillars, eastern tent caterpillars are capable of generating a small amount of metabolic heat while they digest their meals. When recently fed caterpillars pack tightly together, the temperature of the caterpillars in the interior of the mass may be several degrees Celsius above ambient temperature even in the absence of a radiant heat source. It is unclear whether this small heat gain has a significant effect on the rate of caterpillar growth.

Tent caterpillars, like many other species of social caterpillars, vigorously thrash the anterior part of their bodies when they detect predators and parasitoids. Such bouts of thrashing, which may be initiated by a single caterpillar, radiate rapidly though the colony and may result in group displays involving dozens of caterpillars. Such displays create a moving target for tachinid flies, wasps and other small parasitoids that lay their eggs on or in the body of the caterpillar. They also clearly deter stink bugs and other timid predators. Groups of caterpillars resting on the surface of the tent constitute aposematic displays. Few birds other than the cuckoo find the hairy caterpillars palatable. The leaves of the cherry tree are cyanogenic and the caterpillars regurgitate cyanide ladened juices when disturbed.

Tent caterpillars secrete silk from a spinneret wherever they go and frequently used pathways soon bear conspicuous silk trails. As the caterpillars move about the tree, they largely confine their movements to these trails. Curiously, it is not the silk that they follow but a trail pheromone secreted from the posterior tip of their abdomen. Caterpillars deposit exploratory trails by dragging the tip of their abdomen as they move over the tree in search of food. Caterpillars that find food and feed overmark the exploratory trails they follow back to the tent, creating recruitment trails. Recruitment trails are much more attractive to the caterpillars than exploratory trails and they serve to lead hungry caterpillars directly to the newest food finds. It is possible for a single successful forager to recruit the entire colony to its food find.

The exact identity of the trail pheromone of the eastern tent caterpillar has not yet been determined but the chemical 5β-cholestane-3-one has been shown to be fully competitive with the authentic trail pheromone. Caterpillars readily follow trails of this chemical, even abandoning their own trails in favor of artificial trails prepared with the compound.

The eastern tent caterpillar is of some importance as a plant pest since it may defoliate ornamental trees. Defoliated trees, however, rarely suffer significant damage and typically refoliate within several weeks. More seriously, the caterpillar has been implicated in mare reproductive loss syndrome (MRLS), but the exact mechanism by which the caterpillar triggers abortion in horses has yet to be determined.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Symptoms include severe defoliation of the host plant. The sign is the easily recognizable tents made by the colonies.

Sometimes you want to allow a user to be able to add properties to a list that change the appearance of the item in the list.  In this example, the level of indentation is controlled by an attribute in a list called the &quot;level&quot; which is the indentation level in an outline view.

== Discussion ==
The structure of this program uses custom events.  Note that in the model there are a series of actions, each with their own event name:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;xf: model id=&quot;data_model&quot;&gt;
...
   &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;addItemEvent&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

These events are called directly inside of a trigger like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
   &lt;xf:dispatch name=&quot;addItemEvent&quot; target=&quot;data_model&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the target attribute is the name of the model that the events are located.

Although actions can be tucked directly into a  trigger, sometimes action are more logically grouped with instance data and should be placed directly in the model.  This also allows other events need to reuse these actions, so it is a good ideal to put reuseable actions directly in a model

'''Pastei''' is a very old dish and was brought to Suriname by the Jewish settlers. It is a simple dish made from chicken, carrots and peas, and closely resembles chicken pot pie. It is served best with plain white rice.

==Ingredients==

===For the dough===

* 200 g [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 250 g [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 dl (200 ml) cold [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 2 tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

===For the filling===

* 3 large pieces of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (drumstick and thigh, breast, what have you. I use breast most often.)
* 3 [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard boiled eggs]]
* 1 or 2 cans of [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]] and [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
* 1 tblsp [[Cookbook:Piccalilli|piccalilli]] ([[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] can be substituted)
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]]
* 1 piece of young [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* 1 fresh [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]] (or [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]] if preferred) (optional)
* 2 tblsp [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]
* 150 g [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]] (optional)
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] or [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|bouillon cubes]] to get the right taste.

==Procedure==

===For the dough===

If you're on a tight schedule, puff pastry works just as good so you can use that instead of making your own dough.

# Mix the butter with an electric mixer or a wooden spoon. Keep adding little bits of the water until the butter has absorbed it all. 
# Sift the flour, baking powder and the salt all together and add this through the butter gradually. To see if the dough is rollable, press your finger on it and if the dough doesn't stick to it, it's fine. If the dough does stick however, add about 25 more grams of flour. 
# Roll out the dough to make it flat. 
# Put the flattened dough in a baking pan or aluminum foil pan (the pan has to be buttered on the inside before the dough is put in it). Press the dough to the corners of the pan so that as much filling as possible can go in. Do not use all the dough for the inside of the pan, because after the pan has been filled, it needs to be closed off at the top with dough as well.

===For the filling===

# Wash the chicken (if necessary). 
# For about half an hour, cook the chicken, 100 g butter, fine chopped onion, 2 or 3 bouillon cubes, the fresh pepper, the bay leaf and some allspice in about 1 or 1.5 cups of water. 
# After this time, strip the chicken (discarding the bones) into little pieces. 
# Put the rest of the butter in the broth in which the chicken had been boiled. 
# In a pan, put a little bit of oil and when that is hot, add a little bit of fine chopped onion.
# Add the chicken. After a minute add the chopped tomatoes and the peas and carrots. 
# Every so often, add a little bit of the chicken broth to the pan so that it won't burn. 
# Add the chopped pickles. 
# After the broth has been added and the whole seems good, taste to see if it has enough salt, otherwise add some. 
# After the whole has cooled off a bit, get the baking pan with the dough already in it put the chicken and sch in the pan until it is nicely filled. 
# Slice your cooked eggs and place them on top of the filling in the pan. 
# After this is done, the baking pan can be closed off with another piece of dough on the top of the pan. Try to close it up as best as possible. 
# Put the pastei in a preheated oven and leave it for about ¾ of an hour. 
# A few minutes before you take it out of the oven, you can lightly streak the top with some whisked egg to make the top shiny and a little crisp.

Enjoy.

'''Moksi alesie''' is a very delicious rice dish. The name literally means mixed rice. Moksie alesie is usually made by combining different kinds of meat such as chicken, beef and pork, adding a vegetable and rice and cooking all this together.</text>

The '''Chinese Willow''' (''Salix matsudana''), also known as the Hankow Willow or Globe Willow, is a tree or shrub native to northwestern China. The species is named in honour of Sadahisa Matsudo, a Japanese botanist. 

Many botanists treat ''Salix matsudana'' as a synonym of the Peking Willow (''Salix babylonica''), which despite its botanical name is also native to northern China. The only reported difference between the two is that ''S. matsudana'' has two nectaries in each female flower, whereas ''S. babylonica'' has only one; however this character is not reliable in many willows (e.g. Crack Willow can have either one or two).

==Description==
It is a medium-sized to large [[deciduous]] tree, growing up to 20-25 m tall. It is upright and grows rapidly, but has a short lifespan. It has narrow, light green leaves, around 4-10 cm long and 1-2 cm broad. The flowers are catkins produced early in the spring; it is dioecious, with the male and female catkins on separate trees.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
*'Austree' - Very fast growing, generally used for screens
*'Tortuosa' (Corkscrew Willow) - Twisted, spiralling stems and branches, sometimes grown for florists' materiel.
*'Golden Curls' - A hybrid with [[../Salix alba/]] selected for disease resistance.
*'Scarlet Curls' - A hybrid with [[../Salix alba/]] selected for disease resistance.
*'Navajo' - A hybrid with [[../Salix alba/]] selected for disease resistance.

==Uses==
Chinese Willow has been introduced into many areas as an ornamental tree, including Australia, Europe and North America. It is also planted for erosion control on streambanks, and as a source for pulp and lumber.

The corkscrew willows are grown as a florists' crop.

==Maintenance==
Fast growth and weak wood mean that the plant should be pruned regularly to avoid breakups in wind storms. The plant can be coppiced or pollarded. 

==Propagation==
Propagagtion is primarily through cuttings or [[../Stake Planting/]]. 

==Harvest==
For floral uses, the branches are generally cut in the winter, as the leaves are not considered ornamental. The branches will leaf out in the vase if not properly dried out before use. 

==Pests and Diseases==
This species is very susceptible to canker and wind damage. See [[../Salix/]] for an extensive list of pests and diseases.

* a [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 big glass of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 100 grams [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]

==Procedure==
# You need to peel and grate the cassave, and grate the white coconut meat. 
# Beat the eggs and sugar until firm. Add the vanilla and almond essence. 
# Combine the eggs and sugar with the grated coconut and cassava. 
# Add the cinnamon, milk, raisins and salt. 
# Melt the butter and add it to the mixture. 
# Rub the dish you want to use with butter or use Pam. 
# Put the mixture in the dish. Put the dish in a pre-heated oven at 350°F (175°C). Bake the Bojo for about an hour. It needs to be firm on top but not dry on the inside. 

Serving idea: sprinkle some cinnamon on top of the bojo

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Added:''' --[[User:Loek van Kooten|Loek van Kooten]] 15:34, 5 February 2007 (UTC)&lt;p&gt;
'''Version:''' 7.0.284&lt;p&gt;
'''System:''' Windows XP SP2 (Office 2000)&lt;p&gt;
'''Description:''' After import into DVX, single slashes are displayed as double slashes. &lt;p&gt;
'''Description:''' After export to Word, slashes disappear. &lt;p&gt;
'''Description:''' After export to Excel, single slashes are converted to double slashes. &lt;p&gt;
'''Reproduction:''' This issue can be reproduced consistently on at least two systems. &lt;p&gt;
'''Workaround:''' If the document is imported from Word and single slashes are displayed as double slashes in DVX, leave the slashes as they are. If you change them into single slashes, they will disappear after export. &lt;p&gt;
If the document is imported from Excel and single slashes are displayed as double slashes in DVX, change them into single slashes. If you leave the slashes as they are, they will be exported as double slashes.&lt;p&gt;

----

'''Comments from Atril Software:'''&lt;p&gt;
Because embedded codes in DVX are represented as {1} (i.e. opening curly bracket, number, closing curly bracket), the program needs to be able to to handle textual curly brackets in a different way. So some text in Word which appears as &quot;The entry {main} is the starting point&quot; will need to be different inside DVX so that &quot;{main}&quot; isn't confused with an embedded code. The way DVX does this is by adding a backslash before textual curly brackets. So DVX will display &quot;The entry \{main\} is the starting point&quot;.&lt;p&gt;
This means that backslashes are not just textual in DVX either. They are '''control characters''' for escaping curly brackets. So a textual backslash in DVX has to be escaped as well and this happens by doubling it.&lt;p&gt;
So the text in Word &quot;C:\Program Files\&quot; should be imported into DVX as &quot;C:\\Program Files\\&quot; and also translated this way. In the target segment, a single backslash doesn't have any meaning and is only meaningful if paired with another backslash or a curly bracket.&lt;p&gt;
Some filters, such as Excel, have a bug and don't apply these rules correctly or consistently. This is in the process of being fixed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The determinant is a function which associates to a square matrix an element of the field on which it is defined (commonly the real or complex numbers).
The determinant is required to hold these properties:
*It is linear on the rows of the matrix.
:&lt;math&gt;\det \begin{bmatrix}  \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ldots \\ \lambda a_1 + \mu b_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda a_n + \mu b_n \\   \cdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \end{bmatrix} = \lambda \det \begin{bmatrix}  \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \cdots \\ a_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_n \\   \cdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \end{bmatrix} + \mu \det \begin{bmatrix}  \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \cdots \\  b_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; b_n \\   \cdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
*If the matrix has two equal rows its determinant is zero.
*The determinant of the identity matrix is 1.

It is possible to prove that &lt;math&gt; \det A = \det A^T &lt;/math&gt;, making the definition of the determinant on the rows equal to the one on the columns.
==Properties==
*The determinant is zero if and only if the rows are linearly dependent.
*Changing two rows changes the sign of the determinant:
:&lt;math&gt;\det \begin{bmatrix} \cdots \\ \mbox{row A} \\ \cdots \\ \mbox{row B} \\ \cdots \end{bmatrix} = - \det \begin{bmatrix}\cdots \\ \mbox{row B} \\ \cdots \\ \mbox{row A} \\ \cdots \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;


*The determinant is a ''multiplicative map'' in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B) \,&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
This is generalized by the [[Cauchy-Binet formula]] to products of non-square matrices.

*It is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\det(rI_n) = r^n \,&lt;/math&gt; and thus
:&lt;math&gt;\det(rA) = \det(rI_n \cdot A) = r^n \det(A) \,&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-by-&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; matrices &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and all [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

*A matrix over a [[commutative ring]] ''R'' is invertible if and only if its determinant is a [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]] in ''R''.  In particular, if ''A'' is a matrix over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] such as the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s, then ''A'' is invertible if and only if det(''A'') is not zero. In this case we have

:&lt;math&gt;\det(A^{-1}) = \det(A)^{-1}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Expressed differently: the vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] if and only if det(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is non-zero.

A matrix and its [[transpose]] have the same determinant:
:&lt;math&gt;\det(A^\top) = \det(A). \,&lt;/math&gt;

The determinants of
a complex matrix and of its [[conjugate transpose]]
are [[Complex conjugate|conjugate]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\det(A^*) = \det(A)^*. \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Theorems==
===Uniqueness===
===Existance===
Using Laplace's formula for the determinant
===Binet's theorem===
&lt;math&gt;\det(A B) = \det A \cdot \det B &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Uim-typing_hangul.png|210px|thumb|right|Typing Hangul (Korean) in [http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ Gaim].]]
[[Image:Uim-typing_hiragana.png|210px|thumb|right|Typing Hiragana (Japanese) in [http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ Gaim]. ''Uim'' opens up a menu for user selection of homophones.]]
&lt;!-- TODO: Make nicer ones? --&gt;
''Uim'' is an ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input method framework|input method framework]]''. It provides various input methods constructed on a library and a set of tools to convert strings entered in a particular character subset into another subset according to predefined rules defined in a ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input method|input method]]''.

A common use for ''uim'' is to convert keyboard input of Latin characters (such as those used in English) into Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese characters. For Chinese and Japanese, an input sequence that can correspond to multiple character strings will open up a list of candidates to select the desired strings.

== Design ==

Generally, an input method will accept keyboard input and change (either manually or by user interaction) the input string into a different one which it then passes on to the application. Because applications' input method implementation and character sets' characteristics differ greatly, any ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input method framework|input method framework]]'' will face scalability problems when extending its support. To minimize these, ''uim'' has a highly modularized design.

The core library interfaces with loadable software modules that implement a particular natural language (e.g. Chinese or Korean) or input method-specific functionalities (e.g. keyboard-map switching). These modules (one or more) form particular ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input method|input methods]]'' (such as the Pinyin ''input method'' for Chinese). ''Uim'' comes bundled with a number of these, but others are developed as separate projects (e.g. [http://sourceforge.jp/projects/anthy/ Anthy], [http://sourceforge.jp/projects/shinji/ Mana] and [http://taiyaki.org/prime/ PRIME]).

In contrast to the client/server model which other ''input method frameworks'' are primarily based on, ''uim'' implements a library-level interface with applications through application-specific modules called ''[[Uim/Glossary#Bridge|bridges]]''. This layout was chosen mainly for simplicity, and may be changed in the future.

The core library of ''uim'' is primarily written in C to ensure a stable ABI (Application Binary Interface) since maintaining one in C++ is sometimes difficult. Because C is very primitive to work with directly, ''uim'' has an embedded scheme interpreter which allows for more productive development. (Some internal portions of ''uim'' - the xim and scim bridges - are written in C++.)

Productivity for input method developers to facilitate high-quality input methods is a high priority for ''uim''. Though it is stable and fully usable, there are currently less efforts aimed at desktop environment usability which is being prioritized in other ''input method frameworks''.

== Supported platforms and applications ==

''Uim'' is developed on Linux but portable to other *NIX operating systems and is know to also run on Linux Zaurus and Mac OS X.

Any application can use ''uim'' as long as there exists a ''[[Uim/Glossary#Bridge|bridge]]'' for it to connect to the ''uim'' library.
X applications can use [[Uim/uim-xim|uim-xim]] and console applications [[Uim/uim-fep|uim-fep]]. In addition to these, GTK+, Qt and Emacs have their own bridges; [[Uim/gtk+-immodule|gtk+-immodule]], [[Uim/qt-immodule|qt-immodule]] and [[Uim/uim-el|uim-el]], respectively.

== Comparison to other input method software ==

There are several other input methods available. Most cater to a specific language, but ''uim'', [http://www.scim-im.org/ SCIM], and [http://www.openi18n.org/subgroups/im/IIIMF/ IIIMF] (written by the person who made XIM) offer a modular structure for easy extensibility (such software suites are usually called as ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input method framework|input method frameworks]]'').
The main difference between these lies in SCIM and IIIMF's client/server structure, while ''uim'' remains a library-level direct connection with applications via the bridges.
&lt;!--
SCIM is often used as a front-end for ''uim''. ''Uim'' has recently added its own toolbars and there is a slight performance drop from runnig SCIM layered with ''uim'' since a new instance of SCIM must be launched with every new application. A couple of advantages of ''uim'' over SCIM are that it works in console and honours user customizations of the Compose table in &lt;code&gt;~/.XCompose&lt;/code&gt;.

{{:uim/todo|The above description of SCIM is incorrect.}}--&gt;

=== Language-specific input methods ===

; Chinese : The only seemingly still actively developed IM is [http://www.fcitx.org/ Fcitx] (Free Chinese Input Toy for X). Others are [http://sourceforge.net/projects/minichinput minichinput] (no development since 2003-07-17) and [http://cle.linux.org.tw/xcin/ xcin] (apparently no development since 10 Feb 2005).

; Japanese : [http://anthy.sourceforge.jp/ Anthy], [http://taiyaki.org/prime/ PRIME], [http://canna.sourceforge.jp/ canna] and [http://kimera.sourceforge.jp/ kimera] seem to be the main players (all but the last one are available as conversion engines under ''uim''). Lastly, [http://www.sumibi.org/ sumibi] is worth mentioning for its [http://sumibi.org/?long=1 online implementation] of an input method.

; Korean : [http://kldp.net/projects/nabi Nabi] is widely used. There are also [http://kldp.net/projects/imhangul imhangul] for GTK+ and [http://kldp.net/projects/qimhangul qimhangul] for Qt apps.

; Vietnamese : [http://www.unikey.org/linux.php X-unikey] seems to be the only one.

== Current conversion engine implementations ==
''Uim'' comes with a few ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input methods|input methods]]'' but others that are compatible with the scheme interpreter may be installed seperately. The latter have links to their official websites in the list below.

==Thank You==
Hello Khennjo,

I just wanted to personally thank you for contributing to the Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book.  It is greatly appreciated (especially since I know nothing about skin diving).  Thanks! --[[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 17:44, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

== Insignia Images ==

Hi Khennjo,

I'm a little bit uneasy about including the honor patches in the Wikibook.  My concern is that these the copyright to these patch designs are held by the Church, and in everything I've read about that, the church allows their use &quot;for Pathfinder ministry&quot; but not for other purposes.  There may be an incompatibility between that restriction and what is allowed here.  Files uploaded to Wikibooks have to be available for modification, creating derivative works, and for redistribution, including commercial redistribution.  I don't think the Church would accept that.

There is a chance we could work around it by calling it [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free_use|&quot;fair use&quot;]].  In order to do that though, we would have to attach a fair use rationale to the file.  One requirement of using fair use images here is that we would have to demonstrate that adding the image is worth the risk of losing a fair use challenge.  Also, we would have to demonstrate that there is no free (as in liberty) alternative.  

I am not one who enjoys opening a can of worms and engaging in (possibly heated) debate.  So even though I have thought many times about incorporating honor insignia in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]], I had decided against it.  If you are willing to engage in that debate, I can point you in the right direction, but my recommendation is that we not have the honor insignia here.

--[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:18, 28 July 2009 (UTC)
:One other thing.  When you uploaded [[:File:Skindiving.jpg]], you did not attach a license to it.  It will have to be tagged as fair use if you decide (and the Wikibooks community agrees) to keep it here.  Images without a license will be deleted in seven days. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:35, 28 July 2009 (UTC)

::OK, one more other thing!  Great job on [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Skin Diving|Skin Diving]].  I made a few very minor formatting adjustments that I hope are to your liking.  Fantastic! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:55, 28 July 2009 (UTC)


== Thanks Jim! ==

I've removed the file for the honor insignia that I've uploaded yesterday. And thanks for pointing out the issues behind the copyright concerns. I understand your view on this.

And thanks for the formatting adjustments. :)

Thanks again too for having this [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]]. It's been a great resource option for our club here in the Philippines.

Kindest regards! -- [[User:Khennjo|Khennjo]], 29 July 2009
:No problem Kenneth.  Working on this project has been a passion of mine for the past (almost) four years.  It has come a long way in that time, and I am always very gratified when I find out people are using it.  Thanks for your additions too.  They are top-notch. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:17, 29 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

'''''Hydrangea''''' (common names also Hydrangea, pronounced haidréindʒiə, and Hortensia) is a genus of about 70-75 species of flowering plants native to southern and eastern Asia (from Japan to China, the Himalaya and Indonesia) and North and South America. By far the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably China and Japan.

Species in the related genus ''[[../Schizophragma/]]'', also in Hydrangeaceae, are also often known as hydrangeas. ''[[../Schizophragma hydrangeoides/]]'' and ''[[../Hydrangea petiolaris/]]'' are both commonly known as climbing hydrangeas.
==Description==
Most are shrubs 1-3 m tall, but some are small trees, and others lianas reaching up to 30 m by climbing up trees. They can be either deciduous or evergreen, though the widely cultivated temperate species are all deciduous.

Hydrangea flowers are produced from early spring to late autumn; they grow in flowerheads (corymbs or panicles) at the ends of the stems. In many species, the flowerheads contain two types of flowers, small fertile flowers in the middle of the flowerhead, and large, sterile bract-like flowers in a ring around the edge of each flowerhead. Other species have all the flowers fertile and of the same size.

In most species the flowers are white, but in some species (notably H. macrophylla), can be blue, red, pink, or purple. In these species the exact colour often depends on the pH of the soil; acidic soils produce blue flowers, neutral soils produce very pale cream petals, and alkaline soils results in pink or purple. Hydrangeas are one of very few plants that accumulate aluminium. Aluminium is released from acidic soils, and in some species, forms complexes in the hydrangea flower giving them their blue colour.

==Uses==
Hydrangeas are popular ornamental plants, grown for their large flowerheads, with ''[[../Hydrangea macrophylla/]]'' being by far the most widely grown with over 600 named cultivars, many selected to have only large sterile flowers in the flowerheads. Some are best pruned on an annual basis when the new leaf buds begin to appear. If not pruned regularly, the bush will become very 'leggy', growing upwards until the weight of the stems is greater than their strength, at which point the stems will sag down to the ground and possibly break. Other species only flower on 'old wood'. Thus new wood resulting from pruning will not produce flowers the following season.

Hydrangeas are moderately toxic if eaten, with all parts of the plant containing cyanogenic glycosides. However, poisoning in humans is rare, as the plant does not look like an enticing food source.

==Maintenance==
Deadwood tends to accumulate on most species, and needs to be pruned out. Pruning is best performed just after flowering in order to ensure new bud sets for the following year. The plants are frequently deadheaded as well after the flowers fade, but in some cases the flowers do provide some winter interest for the garden.

==Propagation==
Primarily propagated by cuttings, though some species freely self-seed.

==Harvesting==
Flowers can be harvested for use either as fresh or dried flowers. To dry, hang the stems upside-down until fully dry.

I'm sorry if I've offended anyone. I'm confused as to what's wrong here... how can I get in touch with you to get some help with this matter?
:By posting here you are in touch, if you read what has been placed here by two editors you will see that this is not the type of material that is allowed on Wikibooks.  Wikibooks is here to provide &quot;textbooks&quot; for people to read and as both I and the editor above have said your material is not textbook like.  It is possible that you would be better looking on Wikiversity [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page] for the hosting of such material.  You could ask in the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] for further information. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for the additonal info, Herby. I will look into it. It was my impression that this is very much a textbook (in fact, there is an entire class taught by the author on this book at Brown University). Where can I find more information on your definition of &quot;textbook&quot;? I'm guessing from the comments above that you feel that this text is too specific? 

Regarding the page naming policy: I wasn't aware of it until just now, and I was in the process of correcting the naming scheme when you warned me that I would be blocked if I continued to edit the page.

:My apologies - I guess I just expect people to look at what is placed on their page and maybe read around.

Hello and thanks for contributing to Wikibooks. I would not say that New Media Art is not written as a wikibook. I had concerns whether this book can be used as an educational material and is not some kind of advocacy (I have no knowledge in this topic). We are sometimes dealing with works of pseudo-science created on Wikibooks, so please understand why I was a bit suspicious. Now when you said about this book being used on an university, I looked for the it in Google and found it in [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=3822830410 Amazon], so I have no doubts how valuable it is.

So when it comes to content, the book is suitable for Wikibooks, but there are some issues that need to be clarified. First of all, copyright status of New Media Art is not clear. Have all authors given explicit permission to license their work under GFDL licence? Amazon lists Uta Grosenick as an editor of the book; is text corrected by she included here on Wikibooks and if so, has she also given permission to use her work here?

Next, is this text meant to be further edited and improved? There's an another Wikimedia Foundation project - [[s:|Wikisource]], which is an repository of finished, already published books licensed under GFDL licence or not covered by copyrights. Wikisource may be more suitable if there is no sense in making changes to the book.

I will go offline now, since it's already late in my timezone. Please don't fear that your work may be removed - new books are given time to develop and no content is removed without a good reason and prior discussion. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

== Deletion ==

Per your request I have deleted your book. If there are any pages that I might have missed, just tag them with a deletion notice. Thanks. --[[User:Az1568|Az1568]]&lt;sup&gt; ([[User talk:Az1568|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 20:12, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

What if we plan to cut, paste, then re-edit the material from Wikipedia for our WikiBook? Should a request still be made? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:Anthonyfontana|Anthonyfontana]] ([[User talk:Anthonyfontana|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anthonyfontana|contribs]]) 19:35, 5 Feb 2007  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

:Well, anything that's transwikied needs to be edited and adjusted to be a book page, rather than an encyclopedia article. Copyright-wise, import is the safest option if you're going to use an extensive part of the WP article. If you're only using a sentence or two, you could just cite the article as a reference, but if more than that, Import is the best option. It's easy to do, so when in doubt, request an import. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:48, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

== Imported Attribution ==

What if,
# Article &quot;A&quot; is edited by &quot;User:Ans&quot; in wikipedia.
# Article &quot;A&quot; is imported to wikibooks.
# &quot;User:Ans&quot; in wikibooks is not the same person with &quot;User:Ans&quot; in wikipedia?
This will be the miss-attribution.

Can we make the attribution in the imported pages, to be something like &quot;User:Ans@wikipedia&quot; or &quot;User:Ans (imported from wikipedia)&quot; appearing in the revision history.
The mediawiki software should automatically insert text stating that the revision is imported, so, it will be clear that the editor appearing in that revision may not be the same person as in wikibooks.
We should requested this features in the software (if not yet implemented).
--[[User:Ans|Ans]] 06:04, 10 November 2007 (UTC)

:Yeah, that's a problem, but we pretty much just have to wait for SUL to be enabled for that. In some cases accounts can be renamed by b'crats for now (at least here... wikipedia's policy does not acknowledge this issue). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:53, 12 November 2007 (UTC)
:The import does appear in [[Special:Log/Import]], and it also appears in the revision history. You're correct that attribution can be a problem when the same username exists here. With the XML export-import, it is possible to modify the revision history (in particular to make all usernames point to Wikipedia), but the XML import feature is either supersceded by import, or is disabled, or is broken (not sure which). This issue will be solved by SUL though. For now we grin and bear it.

The page implies that articles from foreign language projects like French Wikipedia can't be transwikied here with their histories.

There's some process to go through to have other languages options which would involve discussion or voting just for a developer to type a few lines of code.

::Disagree, failing the possibility of doing a transwiki of the edit history (that I suppose is not permitted, or simple to fix, by the possible username collisions). If we want to be consistent with keeping Wikipedia editors expectations (the edit history merely protects the right to have your work recognized), we should default for the previous method of requiring a general attribution to the specific Wikipedia project (this is how it was done before transwikis became possible). The rational is simple, edit history is only a resource available on the web. If the content is in print there will be no reference to editors (note that edit history is sufficient because Wikipedia articles are not copyrightable, only the aggregation of the articles, the Wikipedia that would by license require a direct attribution.
::&quot;You agree that a hyperlink or URL is sufficient attribution...&quot; edit text refers to inclusion on specific project's page, not its edit history (and I do not know if all project share the statement), this without getting in more complicated issues.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:59, 17 December 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I tried to create an overall structure for a textbook. I freely admit that, while I did look over the guidelines, I didn't actually ''study'' them, and mainly used as my starting point my general understanding of how a textbook should be structured. If that conflicts with specific Wikibooks guidelines, I apologize and if the deviations are so glaring as to be irreconcilable, please feel free to reverse all my changes.

My intention was to have a textbook that could be used to step-by-step learn the discipline, as opposed to a more encyclopedic-style reference book organized into sections, which is what it seemed was the trend. Originally I had planned on taking the already existing material and putting it into its slots, but I quickly noticed that some of those other pages needed to be divided among various chapters so I left it for future edits.

My justifications for the progression I chose (and why I included some topics that may seem to be outside the scope of arithmetic) are varied by decision. Instead of trying to explain everything here, I'll hope that most of the decisions seem to make sense on their own and the ones that don't I'm happy to discuss individually, and at any rate I'm sure everything I've done can be improved upon greatly by other writers.

My plan is first to wait a few days and see if I'm not reversed immediately or that there are no vehement objections to the way I've ordered things. If not, or if the objections can be resolved, the next step is I'll begin to write the overview chapters (the first chapter, as well a the first chapter in each part) so that other authors can see my focus on what should be addressed (obviously, other authors should feel free to beat me to the punch or change focus where it seems necessary). From there, it's just a matter of filling in the material. What I was aiming for is a structure where everything you need to know to understand any given chapter has already been addressed in the previous chapters (in other words, for example, &quot;Exponents&quot; precedes &quot;Scientific Notation&quot; because you have to already know about exponents to understand scientific notion, and multiplication and decimals precede both of them for the same reasons).

Again, my apologies if I've done this completely wrong. I won't be at all offended if I'm reversed for misunderstanding the goal or method. [[User:Peter Alan McAllister|Peter Alan McAllister]] 19:52, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

I removed the link in the table of contents to [[Arithmetic/Multiplication]] (which I've nominated for speedy deletion, as all the content is in [[Arithmetic/Multiplication and Division|Multiplication and Division]] as well as the link to the deleted page titled 'Division'.  Now there is simply the [[Arithmetic/Multiplication and Division|Multiplication and Division]] section. [[User:Atrytone|Atrytone]] ([[User talk:Atrytone|talk]]) 20:24, 11 December 2008 (UTC)

I moved some links to the main table of contents in order to integrate entire sections of the pre-existing content into the structure of the book.
I removed the link in the table of contents to [[Arithmetic/Introduction]] as the material is duplicated in [[Arithmetic/Introduction to Arithmetic]] in the main table of contents.
I removed the link in the table of contents to [[Arithmetic/Reading Serial Numbers, Account Numbers, et cetera]] and nominated the page for speedy deletion because the content is minimal and not necessary for the scope of the book.

== general or introductory? ==

This was moved from general to introductory.  I do not really know why there is a difference, but there is a fundamental theorem of arithmetic, after all (which I added,) which is taught in high-level college courses: I would not call that introductory, though it may be taught in high school Algebra, and maybe in advanced elementary or middle school math, I think.--[[User:Dchmelik|Dchmelik]] ([[User talk:Dchmelik|talk]]) 07:42, 16 April 2009 (UTC)

== Beginner? ==

Is &quot;beginner&quot; really the intended reading level for this book?
* If not — if &quot;intermediate&quot; is more appropriate — then the front page needs to be edited.
* If so, a lot of the text that's already here will need to be rewritten, and some sections could probably be dropped. Also, per the description of &quot;beginner&quot; reading level, perhaps the whole thing should be moved to &quot;Wikijunior&quot;.

A text like this one has the potential to be a thorough Introduction to Art, like many University or College students receive in their first year (or Foundation level) of classes. It should therefore, include in-depth coverage of methods, elements and principles, critical evaluation, and contemporary issues both formal and conceptual in terms and format that are accessible.

'''What this book will not (or should not) do:'''
Marginalize one form of art in favor of another. 
Present information from a Western slanted perspective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Unix V7 Serial Programming =

=== Unix V7 - Introduction ===
Unix V7 was one of the early Unix versions which gained some wider distribution also outside of universities. It was commercially released in 1978. As a consequence, the Unix V7 way of accessing and controlling terminals set the standard for terminal and serial communication in Unix for quite some time. The V7 API does not consist of any particular C function calls. Instead, the settings and configuration of the serial device is done via the standard '''ioctl'''(2) system call, and data transfer is done via the standard '''read'''(2) and '''write'''(2) system calls.

Although, the API originated in Unix V7 it of course didn't remain unchanged. E.g. XENIX used a different name for the &lt;code&gt;tchars&lt;/code&gt; data structure (&lt;code&gt;tc&lt;/code&gt;). Some systems use a 32 bit value for the &lt;code&gt;sg_flags&lt;/code&gt; entry in the &lt;code&gt;sgttyb&lt;/code&gt; structure, others a 16 bit value. BSD added a bunch of ioctls, BSD 4.3 added a bunch of option codes (together sometimes called the BSD I/O environment), partly incompatible with Unix SVR3 codes, ...

All in all, if a later terminal API like &lt;code&gt;termio&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;termios&lt;/code&gt; is available, it makes much sense to use the later API instead of the Unix V7, or V7-lookalike API. If the Unix V7 API is really used, some extensive study of the particular system's documentation and include files is in order. Nevertheless, there is some chance to find that the API is used in some classic Unix source code, particular in free software from that age that survived until today.

Originally, the necessary definitions for the terminal (serial) specific '''ioctl'''(2) system calls could be found in the &lt;tt&gt;sgtty.h&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;sys/tty.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; headers. However, in later Unix versions the contents was moved to &lt;tt&gt;sys/ttold.h&lt;/tt&gt; and parts of it also ended up in &lt;tt&gt;termios.h&lt;/tt&gt;, or the API was removed completely. 

Mentioning &lt;tt&gt;termios.h&lt;/tt&gt; here sounds rather strange, since it is a later API. But termio and termios borrowed from the V7 API, and systems which still support the V7 API often do this by emulating the API on top of the normal termio or termios interface with a compatible device driver. This is done by pushing an additional STREAMS device driver module on top of the termio or termios device driver. That STREAMS module is typically called &lt;tt&gt;ttycompat&lt;/tt&gt;. How a particular Unix system can be configured to automatically push the module onto a device, how it can be manually pushed, or how the STREAMS device framework works is out of the scope of this description.

=== Unix V7 - Mode of Operation ===

As already mentioned, the Unix V7 way of controlling terminal devices is to use '''ioctl'''(2) system calls. '''ioctl'''(2) is not specific to serial devices. The system call is part of Unix's generic device driver interface. The more widely used system calls for this interface are '''read'''(2) and '''write'''(2). While '''read'''(2) and '''write'''(2) do transport the &quot;payload&quot; (the data), '''ioctl'''(2) on the other hand '''c'''on'''t'''ro'''l'''s the '''I'''/'''O''' operation as such. That is, it enables a program to configure the device.

The generic signature of the system call is

 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;       /* Unix SVR4 family */
 int ioctl(int fd, int command, ...);
or
 #include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;    /* Unix BSD family */
 int ioctl(int fd, int command, ...);
or
 ioctl(fd, command, data) /* Unix V7 - K&amp;R C */
 int fd, command;
 char *data;

With the following arguments:

;&lt;code&gt;fd&lt;/code&gt;: is a file descriptor pointing to an opened device.

;&lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt;:is an integer which tells the device what to do, and logically needs to be known by the device. The list of commands a serial device is supposed to understand is defined in &lt;tt&gt;sys/ttold.h&lt;/tt&gt; (newer Unix systems) or &lt;tt&gt;sgtty.h&lt;/tt&gt; plus &lt;tt&gt;sys/tt.h&lt;/tt&gt; (old Unix systems like Unix V7) as macros. For the remainder of this section &lt;tt&gt;sys/ttold.h&lt;/tt&gt; is used. Typically, &lt;tt&gt;sys/ttold.h&lt;/tt&gt; is itself included by &lt;tt&gt;sys/ioctl.h&lt;/tt&gt;. However, it doesn't hurt to include it explicitly for good measure.

:The names of the core terminal I/O control command macros start with &lt;code&gt;TIO...&lt;/code&gt;. In addition, a few file I/O control commands are also applicable. Their names start with &lt;code&gt;FIO...&lt;/code&gt;. We come to the commands and their purpose later, however, device-specific commands (&lt;code&gt;DIO...&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MX...&lt;/code&gt;) are not discussed.

;&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;:The actual parameter for the vararg ellipse &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; arguments of '''ioctl'''() is typically only a single pointer to some data structure - at least for the terminal control commands. This matches the old '''ioctl'''() format, where there was one single &lt;code&gt;char *data&lt;/code&gt; argument. 

;&lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;:For terminal control the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; pointer points to a data structure of type
:*&lt;code&gt;struct sgttyb&lt;/code&gt;,
:*&lt;code&gt;struct tchars&lt;/code&gt; or
:*&lt;code&gt;struct ltchars&lt;/code&gt;.

These data structures are used to communicate different types of information between the devioce driver and the application program. They control which settings are supposed to be done, or allow to fetch which parameters are currently set for the device.

Typically &lt;code&gt;struct sgttyb&lt;/code&gt; looks like:

  struct sgttyb {
      char sg_ispeed;  /* input line speed  */
      char sg_ospeed;  /* output line speed */
      char sg_erase;   /* erase char        */
      char sg_kill;    /* kill char         */
      int  sg_flags;   /* flags             */
  };

As one can see, it allows a program to communicate basic settings like the line speed and essential characters for the line discipline. Remember, the interface was made for communication with terminals, and therefore provides the support for a line discipline.

Typically &lt;code&gt;struct tchars&lt;/code&gt; contains additional information about terminal control characters and looks like:

 struct tchars {
     char t_intrc;  /* interrupt character       */
     char t_quitc;  /* quit character            */
     char t_startc; /* start output character    */
     char t_stopc;  /* stop output character     */
     char t_eofc;   /* end-of-file character     */
     char t_brkc;   /* input delimiter character */
 };

In addition to these data structures BSD added more terminal control characters in:

 struct ltchars {
     char t_suspc;  /* stop-process character         */
     char t_dsuspc; /* delayed stop-process character */
     char t_rprntc; /* reprint line character         */
     char t_flushc; /* flush output character         */
     char t_werasc; /* word erase character           */
     char t_lnextc; /* literal next character         */
 };

To summarize, a configuration of a serial device generally follows the following template of statements (pseudo code, error handling, etc. excluded):

 #include &lt;sys/stream.h&gt;     /* for ldterm */
 #include &lt;sys/termios.h&gt;    /* for ldterm - could of course also be used directly */
 #include &lt;sys/stropts.h&gt;    /* for handling the STREAMS module */
 #include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;      /* ioctl() signature */
 #include &lt;sys/ttold.h&gt;      /* terminal control */
 #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;      /* for open() */
 #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;       /* for open() */
 #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;          /* for open() */
   :
   .
 struct sgttyb data;
 int fd;
   :
   .
 /* 
  * Open the device.
  * O_RDRW   - open for reading and writing
  * O_NDELAY - ignore the state of the DCD line. Otherwise
  *            the ioctl() blocks until DCD indicates the
  *            remote side is ready. Also affects behavior of
  *            the read(2) system call, which will now not block
  *            if there is no input data available.
  * O_NOCTTY - Do not become a controlling terminal. Has no effect for STREAMS
  */
 fd = open(&quot;/dev/ttya&quot;, O_RDWR | O_NDELAY | O_NOCTTY);&lt;br&gt;

=== Unix V7 - Terminal I/O Control Commands ===

{{stubpar}}
==== Overview ====
As already mentioned, the possible terminal I/O control commands to be used for terminal devices via '''ioctl'''() are defined as macros. This section discusses their meaning and usage in '''ioctl'''() system calls.

Unfortunately, the set of commands is a mess. Almost every implementation of Unix decided it would be cool to add their own, incompatible commands. To add insult to injury, some popular Unix versions defined particular commands, but couldn't be bothered to implement them for decades, then dropped them. And to make even more programmers happy, half of the commands where never in any way seriously documented or described. The programmers apparently thought that only those with access to the Kernel source code are deemed worthy to program serial interfaces.

==== Original Unix V7 ioctls ====

This section lists the original Unix V7 I/O control commands. They are presented as they are used as part of an '''ioctl'''(2) call. This has been done, so the passed data types can also be presented. The argument data types are underlined in the following list.

===== Line Discipline =====
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCGETD'', &lt;u&gt;int *&lt;/u&gt;dscp):Get line discipline. See below.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCSETD'', &lt;u&gt;int *&lt;/u&gt;dscp:Set line discipline.
These commands did exist in V7, and were implemented. However, they were not documented. Particularly, the argument's meaning was not documented (and probably not used). Later the following argument interpretation was added:
:;OTTYDISC or 0:Unix V7 tty driver behavior
:;NETLDISC or 1:BSD Unix driver behavior
:;NTTYDISC or 2:New tty line discipline (''whatever that is'')

A typical usage looks as it follows. The &lt;code&gt;#ifdef&lt;/code&gt; test is done to avoid executing the '''ioctl'''() on a system with undefined TIOCSETD argument semantics (like the original V7, where the arguments of the command were not documented). The following changes the line discipline of the device identified by the handle ''fd'' to the Unix V7 tty driver behavior.

 #ifdef OTTYDISC
   int dscp = OTTYDISC;
   ioctl(fd, TIOCSETD, &amp;dscp);
 #endif

===== Hang-up on close =====
When a DT (data terminal, the computer) is no longer ready to send and receive serial data on an interface, it is supposed to drop the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) RS-232 control line of that serial interface. The following command allows to automate this.

;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCHPCL'', &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;NULL):Set ''hang up on last close'' flag. Typically this is implemented as dropping the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) pin on the serial interface when the last '''close'''(2) is called on the device. Note, there is no direct inverse operation in V7. However, the flag can be cleared in some implementations via the &lt;code&gt;sg_flags&lt;/code&gt; member of &lt;code&gt;struct sgttyb&lt;/code&gt;.

A typical sequence of events would look like it follows:

 /**********************************************************
  * Set ''hang up on last close'' flag
  *********************************************************/
 /*
 /* open device */
 fd = open(&quot;/dev/ttya&quot;, O_RDWR | O_NDELAY | O_NOCTTY);
 &lt;br&gt;
 /* device configuration (omitted) */
 &lt;br&gt;
 /* Set ''hang up on last close'' flag to drop DTR on last close */
 ioctl(fd, TIOCHPCL, NULL);
 &lt;br&gt;
 /* communicate via serial interface */
 &lt;br&gt;
 /*
  * Close device. If this is the last close (which it typically is), DTR
  * will be dropped/
  */
 close(fd);

 /**********************************************************
  * Clear ''hang up on last close'' flag via TIOCSETP
  * Note the slightly different flag name HUPCL here
  * vs. HPCL in TIOC''HPCL''.
  *********************************************************/
 &lt;br&gt;
 struct sgttyb tparam;
 ...
 fd = open( ... );
 ...
 ioctl(fd, TIOCGETP, &amp;tparam);  /* get current values */
 tparam.sg_flags &amp;= ~HUPCL;     /* only clear H[U]PCL flag */
 ioctl(fd, TIOCSETP, &amp;tparam);  /* apply changed parameters */

===== Modem State =====
Unix V7 had undocumented and probably unsupported commands for getting and setting a ''modem state''.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCMODG'', &lt;u&gt;int *&lt;/u&gt;state):Get modem state. Usually not implemented and not used. See TIOCMGET for getting the RS-232 control line status.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCMODS'', &lt;u&gt;int *&lt;/u&gt;state):Set modem state. Usually not implemented and not used. See TIOCMSET for setting the RS-232 control lines.
The original semantics of the &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; variable have been lost in the mist of time. On some implementations the later TIOCM_x macros for TIOCMGET/TIOCMSET are available and do also work with TIOCMODx. The TIOCM_x flags are:
;TIOCM_LE: (not V7) Line enable signal
;TIOCM_DTR: (not V7) Data terminal ready
;TIOCM_RTS: (not V7) Request to send
;TIOCM_ST: (not V7) Secondary transmit (?)
;TIOCM_SR: (not V7) Secondary receive (?)
;TIOCM_CTS: (not V7) Clear to send
;TIOCM_CD, TIOCM_CAR: (not V7) Carrier detect
;TIOCM_RI, TIOCM_RNG: (not V7) Ring indicator
;TIOCM_DSR: (not V7) Data set ready

 /**********************************************************
  * Set the RTS line if possible.
  * This mixes a TIOCM_x macro intended for TIOCMGET/TIOCMSET
  * with TIOCMODx and is not recommended.
  *********************************************************/
 &lt;br&gt; 
 int state;
 ...
 #if defined(TIOCM_RTS) &amp;&amp; defined(TIOCMODG)
    ioctl(fd, TIOCMODG, &amp;state);
    state |= TIOCM_RTS;
    ioctl(fd, TIOCMODS, &amp;state);
 #endif

===== Terminal Parameters =====
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCGETP'', &lt;u&gt;struct sgttyb *&lt;/u&gt;data):Get the terminal parameters. They are stored in &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;.
;gtty(fd, &lt;u&gt;struct sgttyb *&lt;/u&gt;data):Short version for TIOCGETP ioctl on some systems derived from V7.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCSETP'', &lt;u&gt;struct sgttyb *&lt;/u&gt;data):Set the interface to the provided parameters. Waits until output has drained. Clears (throws away) any pending input data, and then applies the parameters.
;stty(fd, &lt;u&gt;struct sgttyb *&lt;/u&gt;data):Short version for TIOCSETP ioctl on some systems derived from V7.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCSETN'', &lt;u&gt;struct sgttyb *&lt;/u&gt;data):Sets the interface to the provided parameters, but does not wait for drained output and does not clear input data. Depending on the hardware this used to generate some garbage input/output characters.

==== More Original Unix V7 sgtty.h ioctls ====

The following ioctls were all defined in the Unix V7 tty interface, but with a few exceptions not properly documented. The ''D'' ioctls were probably intended to control dialers (''ACUs''). The ''F'' ioctls are borrowed from file I/O. The ''M'' ioctls are actually intended for Unix/V7 special multiplexed (mxp) files - an Unix/V7 mechanism for inter-process communication. Why these ioctls are defined in sgtty.h is unclear, other mpx ioctls are defined in sys/mx.h instead.

;DIOCLSTN:
;DIOCNTRL:
;DIOCMPX:
;DIOCNMPX:
;DIOCSCALL:
;DIOCRCALL:
;DIOCPGRP:

;DIOCGETP:Per line-discipline get data.
;DIOCSETP:Per line-discipline set data.

;DIOCLOSE:
;DIOCTIME:
;DIOCRESET:
;FIOCLEX:Set the close-on-exec flag for this file descriptor. If the process is spawned (forked/execed), the file descriptor will be closed by the exec() system call. That way the spawned process doesn't inherit the open terminal interface.
;FIONCLEX:Clear the close-on-exec flag for this file descriptor. If the process is spawned (forked/execed), the file descriptor will  not be closed by the exec() system call. That way the spawned process inherits the open terminal interface.
;MXLSTN:Place the mpx file in listener mode.
;MXNBLK:Use non-blocking mode for the mpx file.

==== Terminal ioctls acquired over time ====

There are quite some additional I/O controls which have been acquired over time and which enhance the Unix V7 teletype API. The following are the ones which are rather common. Later interfaces like termio and termios also added I/O controls. These are not listed here.
----
Sending a break signal can be performed with the following two commands:

;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCSBRK'', &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;NULL):Set the ''break'' flag. Sends a ''break'' signal over the serial line. A ''break'' is an all-zero framing error.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCCBRK'', &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;NULL):Clear the ''break'' flag. Stops sending a ''break'' signal.

A simplified way to send a one-second break looks as it follows:

 ioctl(fd, TIOCSBRK, NULL); /* start break signal */
 /*
  * The following blocks the process for one second.
  * This is &quot;suboptimal&quot; in real applications.
  * Using asynchronous I/O and alarm(2)/setitimer(2)/signal(2)
  * or similar system calls, plus a callback which, when called,
  * turns the break of, is a better alternative.
  * Also, the granularity of sleep() is to rough, since
  * breaks of 250 ... 500 milliseconds are typical in
  * serial communication.
  */
 sleep(1);                  /* wait one second */
 ioctl(fd, TIOCCBRK, NULL); /* stop sending break signal */ 
 
----

The following commands can be used to control the RS-232 control lines:

;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCSDTR'', &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;NULL):Set DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCCDTR'', &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;NULL):Clear DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal.
&lt;!-- Aren't the following POSIX, not V7 ioctls? --&gt;
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCMODG'', &lt;u&gt;int *&lt;/u&gt;state):Get modem state. See below.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCMODS'', &lt;u&gt;int *&lt;/u&gt;state):Set modem state. Allows to access all RS-232 control lines. The status of each line is indicated by a bit in the &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; argument. The bits have the following symbolic names:
:;TIOCM_CAR '''or''' TIOCM_CD:DCD . Data Carrier Detect
:;TIOCM_CTS:CTS - Clear to send
:;TIOCM_DTR:DTR - Data terminal ready
:;TIOCM_LE '''or''' TIOCM_DSR:DSR - Data set ready
:;TIOCM_RNG '''or''' TIOCM_RI:RNG - Ring indicator
:;TIOCM_RTS:RTS - Request to send
:;TIOCM_SR:Secondary RxD
:;TIOCM_ST:Secondary TxD

Depending on which of the above commands is available, DTR can, for example be set as it follows:

 ioctl(fd, TIOCSDTR, NULL);
or
 int state;
 ioctl(fd, TIOCMGET, &amp;state);
 state |= TIOCM_DTR;
 ioctl(fd, TIOCMSET, &amp;state);
 
----
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCSTOP'', &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;NULL):Stop output as if the ''stop'' character has been typed.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCSTART'', &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;data_p):Restart output as if the ''start'' character has been typed.
----
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCLGET'', &lt;u&gt;int *&lt;/u&gt;flags):Get the terminal flags. See element &lt;code&gt;sg_flags&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;struct sgttyp&lt;/code&gt; for the details.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCLBIS'', &lt;u&gt;int *&lt;/u&gt;flags):Set particular terminal flags. The flags are or-ed with the currently already set flags.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCLBIC'', &lt;u&gt;int *&lt;/u&gt;flags):Clear particular terminal flags. The flags are &quot;not-and-ed&quot; with the existing flags.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCLSET'', &lt;u&gt;int *&lt;/u&gt;flags):Set the terminal flags.
----
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCGLTC'', &lt;u&gt;struct ltchars *&lt;/u&gt;data):Get ltchars data.
;ioctl(fd, ''TIOCSLTC'', &lt;u&gt;struct ltchars *&lt;/u&gt;data):Set ltchars data.
----
;ioctl(fd, ''FIORDCHK'', &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;NULL):Return the number of currently available input characters in the input buffer. The number is returned as the return value of the function call.
;ioctl(fd, ''FIONREAD'', &lt;u&gt;int *&lt;/u&gt;nbr):Return the number of currently available input characters in the input buffer. The number is written in to the &lt;tt&gt;*nbt&lt;/tt&gt; argument.

== Introduction {{stage short|25%|Jul 23, 2005}} ==

termios is the newer (now already a few decades old) Unix API for terminal I/O. The anatomy of a program performing serial I/O with the help of termios is as follows:

* Open serial device with standard Unix system call '''open'''(2)

* Configure communication parameters and other interface properties (line discipline, etc.) with the help of specific termios functions and data structures.

* Use standard Unix system calls '''read'''(2) and '''write'''(2) for reading from, and writing to the serial interface. Related system calls like '''readv'''(2) and '''writev'''(2) can be used, too. Multiple I/O techniques, like blocking, non-blocking,  asynchronous I/O ('''select'''(2) or '''poll'''(2)) or signal-drive I/O (SIGIO signal) are also possible.

* Close device with the standard Unix system call '''close'''(2) when done.

The necessary declarations and constants for termios can be found in the header file &lt;tt&gt;&lt;termios.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. So code for serial or terminal I/O will usually start with

 #include &lt;termios.h&gt;

Some additional functions and declarations can also be found in the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;fcntl.h&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;unistd.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; header files.

The termios I/O API supports two different modes: ''doesn't old termio do this too? if yes, move paragraphs up to the general section about serial and terminal I/O in Unix).''

1.  Canonical mode.&lt;br/&gt;This is most useful when dealing with real terminals, or devices that provide line-by-line communication. The terminal driver returns data line-by-line.
 
2.  Non-canonical mode.&lt;br/&gt;In this mode, no special processing is done, and the terminal driver returns individual characters.

On BSD-like systems, there are three modes:

1.  Cooked Mode.&lt;br&gt;Input is assembled into lines and special characters are processed.

2.  Raw mode.&lt;br&gt;Input is not assembled into lines and special characters are not processed.

3.  Cbreak mode.&lt;br&gt;Input is not assembled into lines but some special characters are processed.

Unless set otherwise, canonical (or cooked mode under BSD) is the default. The special characters processed in the corresponding modes are control characters, such as end-of-line or backspace. The full list for a particular Unix flavor can be found in the corresponding termios ''man page''. For serial communication it is often advisable to use non-canonical, (raw or cbreak mode under BSD) to ensure that transmitted data is not interpreted by the terminal driver. Therefore, when setting up the communication parameters, the device should also configured for raw/non-canonical mode by setting/clearing the corresponding termios flags. It is also possible to enable or disable the processing of the special characters on an individual basis.

This configuration is done by using the &lt;code&gt;struct termios&lt;/code&gt; data structure, defined in the &lt;code&gt;termios.h&lt;/code&gt; header. This structure is central to both the configuration of a serial device and querying its setup. It contains a minimum of the following fields:

 struct termios {
   tcflag_t c_iflag;    /* input specific flags (bitmask) */
   tcflag_t c_oflag;    /* output specific flags (bitmask) */
   tcflag_t c_cflag;    /* control flags (bitmask) */
   tcflag_t c_lflag;    /* local flags (bitmask) */
   cc_t     c_cc[NCCS]; /* special characters */
 };

It should be noted that real &lt;code&gt;struct termios&lt;/code&gt; declarations are often much more complicated. This stems from the fact that Unix vendors implement termios so that it is backward compatible with termio and integrate termio and termios behavior in the same data structure so they can avoid to have to implement the same code twice. In such a case, an application programmer may be able to intermix termio and termios code.

There are more than 45 different flags that can be set (via &lt;code&gt;tcsetattr()&lt;/code&gt;) or got (via &lt;code&gt;tcgetattr()&lt;/code&gt;) with the help of the &lt;code&gt;struct termios&lt;/code&gt;. The large number of flags, and their sometimes esoteric and pathologic meaning and behavior, is one of the reasons why serial programming under Unix can be hard. In the device configuration, one must be careful not to make a mistake.

== Opening/Closing a Serial Device {{stage short|00%|Jul 23, 2005}} ==

=== open(2) ===

A few decisions have to be made when opening a serial device. Should the device be opened for reading only, writing only, or both reading and writing? Should the device be opened for blocking or non-blocking I/O (non-blocking is recommended)? While '''open'''(2) can be called with quite a
number of different flags controlling these and other properties, the following as a typical example:

 const char *device = &quot;/dev/ttyS0&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;
 fd = open(device, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);
 if(fd == -1) {
   printf( &quot;failed to open port\n&quot; );
 }

Where:

;device:The path to the serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyS0)
;fd:The returned file handle for the device. -1 if an error occurred
;O_RDWR:Opens the port for reading and writing  
;O_NOCTTY:The port never becomes the controlling terminal of the process.
;O_NDELAY:Use non-blocking I/O. On some systems this also means the RS232 DCD signal line is ignored.

NB:  Be sure to #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt; as well for the constants listed above.

=== close(2) ===

Given an open file handle ''fd'' you can close it with the following system call

 close(''fd'');

== Basic Configuration of a Serial Interface ==

After a serial device has been opened, it is typical that its default configuration, like baud rate or line discipline need
to be override with the desired parameters. This is done with a rather complex data structure, and the '''tcgetattr'''(3) and
'''tcsetattr'''(3) functions. Before that is done, however, it is a good idea to check if the opened device is
indeed a serial device (aka ''tty'').

The following is an example of such a configuration. The details are explained later in this module.

 #include &lt;termios.h&gt;
 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 struct termios  config;&lt;br&gt;
 if(!isatty(fd)) { ... error handling ... }&lt;br /&gt;
 if(tcgetattr(fd, &amp;config) &lt; 0) { ... error handling ... }&lt;br /&gt;
 //
 // Input flags - Turn off input processing
 // convert break to null byte, no CR to NL translation,
 // no NL to CR translation, don't mark parity errors or breaks
 // no input parity check, don't strip high bit off,
 // no XON/XOFF software flow control
 //
 config.c_iflag &amp;= ~(IGNBRK | BRKINT | ICRNL |
                     INLCR | PARMRK | INPCK | ISTRIP | IXON);&lt;br /&gt;
 //
 // Output flags - Turn off output processing
 // no CR to NL translation, no NL to CR-NL translation,
 // no NL to CR translation, no column 0 CR suppression,
 // no Ctrl-D suppression, no fill characters, no case mapping,
 // no local output processing
 //
 // config.c_oflag &amp;= ~(OCRNL | ONLCR | ONLRET |
 //                     ONOCR | ONOEOT| OFILL | OLCUC | OPOST);
 config.c_oflag = 0;&lt;br /&gt;
 //
 // No line processing:
 // echo off, echo newline off, canonical mode off, 
 // extended input processing off, signal chars off
 //
 config.c_lflag &amp;= ~(ECHO | ECHONL | ICANON | IEXTEN | ISIG);&lt;br /&gt;
 //
 // Turn off character processing
 // clear current char size mask, no parity checking,
 // no output processing, force 8 bit input
 //
 config.c_cflag &amp;= ~(CSIZE | PARENB);
 config.c_cflag |= CS8;&lt;br /&gt;
 //
 // One input byte is enough to return from read()
 // Inter-character timer off
 //
 config.c_cc[VMIN]  = 1;
 config.c_cc[VTIME] = 0;&lt;br /&gt;
 //
 // Communication speed (simple version, using the predefined
 // constants)
 //
 if(cfsetispeed(&amp;config, B9600) &lt; 0 || cfsetospeed(&amp;config, B9600) &lt; 0) {
     ... error handling ...
 }&lt;br /&gt;
 //
 // Finally, apply the configuration
 //
 if(tcsetattr(fd, TCSAFLUSH, &amp;config) &lt; 0) { ... error handling ... }
 
This code is definitely not a pretty sight. It only covers the most important flags of the more than 60 termios flags. The flags
should be revised, depending on the actual application.

== Line-Control Functions {{stage short|25%|Jul 23, 2005}} ==

termios contains a number of line-control functions. These allow a more fine-grained control over the serial line in certain special situations. They all work on a file descriptor ''fildes'', returned by an '''open'''(2) call to open the serial device. In the case of an error, the detailed cause can be found in the global &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; variable (see '''errno'''(2)).

===tcdrain===
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#include &lt;termios.h&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 int tcdrain(int ''fildes'');

Wait until all data previously written to the serial line indicated by &lt;code&gt;fildes&lt;/code&gt; has been sent. This means, the function will return when the UART's send buffer has cleared.&lt;br&gt;If successful, the function returns 0. Otherwise it returns -1, and the global variable &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; contains the exact reason for the error.

==== use case ====

Todays computer are fast, have more cores and a lot of optimization inside. That can cause strange results because it result depends on circumstances the programmer may not aware of. See the example below:

[[File:ohne_tcdrain.jpg|thumb|without tcdrain()]]
  set_rts();
  write(); 
  clr_rts();

With that code you would expect a signal going up, the write and a signal going down. But that is wrong. Perhaps optimization causes the kernel to report success to write before the data are really written.


Now the same code using tcdrain()
[[File:mit_tcdrain.jpg|thumb|with tcdrain()]]
  set_rts();
  write();
  tcdrain(); 
  clr_rts();


Suddenly the code behaves as expected, because the clr_rts(); is executed only when data really is written. Several programmers solve the problem by using sleep()/usleep() what may be not exactly what you want.

===tcflow===
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#include &lt;termios.h&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 int tcflow(int ''fildes'', int ''action'');

This function suspends/restarts transmission and/or reception of data on the serial device indicated by ''fildes''. The exact function is controlled by the ''action'' argument. ''action'' should be one of the following constants:
;TCOOFF:Suspend output.
;TCOON:Restarts previously suspended output.
;TCIOFF:Transmit a &lt;code&gt;STOP&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;xoff&lt;/code&gt;) character. Remote devices are supposed to stop transmitting data if they receive this character. This requires the remote device on the other end of the serial line to support this software flow-control.
;TCION:Transmit a &lt;code&gt;START&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;xon&lt;/code&gt;) character. Remote devices should restart transmitting data if they receive this character. This requires the remote device on the other end of the serial line to support this software flow-control.

If successful, the function returns 0. Otherwise it returns -1, and the global variable &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; contains the exact reason for the error.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;#include &lt;termios.h&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 int tcflush(int ''fildes'', int ''queue_selector'');

Flushes (discards) not-send data (data still in the UART send buffer) and/or flushes (discards) received data (data already in the UART receive buffer). The exact operation is defined by the ''queue_selector'' argument. The possible constants for ''queue_selector'' are:
;TCIFLUSH:Flush received, but unread data.
;TCOFLUSH:Flush written, but not send data.
;TCIOFLUSH:Flush both.

If successful, the function returns 0. Otherwise it returns -1, and the global variable &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; contains the exact reason for the error.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;#include &lt;termios.h&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 int tcsendbreak(int ''fildes'', int ''duration_flag'');

Sends a break for a certain duration. The ''duration_flag'' controls the duration of the break signal:
;0:Send a break of at least 0.25 seconds, and not more than 0.5 seconds.
;''any other value'':For other values than 0, the behavior is implementation defined. Some implementations interpret the value as some time specifications, others just let the function behave like ''tcdrain()''.

A break is a deliberately generated framing (timing) error of the serial data &amp;ndash; the signal's timing is violated by sending a series of zero bits, which also encompasses the start/stop bits, so the framing is explicitly gone.

If successful, the function returns 0. Otherwise it returns -1, and the global variable &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; contains the exact reason for the error.

== Reading and Setting Parameters ==

=== Introduction ===

There are more than 60 parameters a serial interface in Unix can have, assuming of course the underlying hardware supports every possible parameter - which many serial devices in professional workstations and Unix servers indeed do. This plethora of parameters and the resulting different interface configuration is what make serial programming in Unix and Linux challenging. Not only are there so many parameters, but their meanings are often rather unknown to contemporary hackers, because they originated at the dawn of computing, where things were done differently and are no longer known or taught in Little-Hacker School.

Nevertheless, most of the parameters of a serial interface in Unix are just controlled via two functions:

;tcgetattr():For reading the current attributes.
and
;tcsetattr():For setting serial interface attributes.

All information about the configuration of a serial interface is stored in an instance of the &lt;tt&gt;struct termios&lt;/tt&gt; data type. '''tcgetattr()''' requires a pointer to a pre-allocated &lt;tt&gt;struct termios&lt;/tt&gt; where it reads the values from. '''tcsetattr()''' requires a pointer to a pre-allocated and initialized &lt;tt&gt;struct termios&lt;/tt&gt; where the function writes to.

Further, speed parameters are set via a separate set of functions:

;cfgetispeed():Get line-in speed.
;cfgetospeed():Get line-out speed.
;cfsetispeed():Set line-in speed.
;cfsetospeed():Set line-out speed.

The following sub-section explain the mentioned functions in more detail.

=== Attribute Changes ===

50+ attributes of a serial interface in Unix can be read with a single function: '''tcgetattr()'''. Among these parameters are all the option flags and, for example, information about which special character handling is applied. The signature of that function is as it follows:

 #include &lt;termios.h&gt;
 int tcgetattr(int fd, struct termios *attribs);

Where the arguments are:
;fd:A file handle pointing to an opened terminal device. The device has typically be opened via the '''open'''(2) system call. However, there are several more mechanisms in Unix to obtain a legitimate file handle (e.g. by inheriting it over a '''fork'''(2)/'''exec'''(2) combo). As long as the handle points to an opened terminal device things are fine. 
;&lt;nowiki&gt;*attribs&lt;/nowiki&gt;:A pointer to a pre-allocated &lt;tt&gt;struct termios&lt;/tt&gt;, where '''tcgetattr()''' will write to.

'''tcgetattr()''' returns an integer that either indicates success or failure in the way typical for Unix system calls:

;0:Indicates successful completion
;-1:Indicates failure. Further information about the problem can be found in the global (or thread-local) &lt;tt&gt;errno&lt;/tt&gt; variable. See the '''errno'''(2), '''intro'''(2), and/or '''perror'''(3C) man page for information about the meaning of the &lt;tt&gt;errno&lt;/tt&gt; values.

:Note; it is a typical beginner and hacker error to not check the return value and assume everything will always work.

The following is a simple example demonstrating the use of '''tcgetattr()'''. It assumes that standard input has been redirected to a terminal device:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 #include &lt;termios.h&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 int main(void) {
     struct termios attribs;
     speed_t speed;&lt;br&gt;
     if(tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &amp;attribs) &lt; 0) {
         perror(&quot;stdin&quot;);
         return EXIT_FAILURE;
     }&lt;br&gt;
     /*
      * The following mess is to retrieve the input
      * speed from the returned data. The code is so messy,
      * because it has to take care of a historic change in
      * the usage of struct termios. Baud rates were once
      * represented by fixed constants, but later could also
      * be represented by a number. cfgetispeed() is a far
      * better alternative.
      */
     if(attribs.c_cflag &amp; CIBAUDEXT) {
         speed = ((attribs.c_cflag &amp; CIBAUD) &gt;&gt; IBSHIFT)
                  + (CIBAUD &gt;&gt; IBSHIFT) + 1;
     } 
     else
     {
         speed = (attribs.c_cflag &amp; CIBAUD) &gt;&gt; IBSHIFT;
     }
     printf(&quot;input speed: %ul\n&quot;, (unsigned long) speed);&lt;br&gt;
     /*
      * Check if received carriage-return characters are
      * ignored, changed to new-lines, or passed on
      * unchanged.
      */
     if(attribs.c_iflag &amp; IGNCR) {
         printf(&quot;Received CRs are ignored.\n&quot;);
     }
     else if(attribs.c_iflag &amp; ICRNK)
     {
         printf(&quot;Received CRs are translated to NLs.\n&quot;);
     }
     else 
     {
         printf(&quot;Received CRs are not changed.\n&quot;);
     }&lt;br&gt;
     return EXIT_SUCCESS;
 }

Once the above program is compiled and linked, let's say under the name &lt;tt&gt;example&lt;/tt&gt;, it can be run as it follows:

  ./example &lt; /dev/ttya

Assuming, &lt;tt&gt;/dev/ttya&lt;/tt&gt; is a valid serial device. One can run '''stty''' to verify of the output is correct.


'''tcsetattr()'''
{{sectstub}}

 #include &lt;termios.h&gt;
 tcsetattr( int fd, int optional_actions, const struct termios *options );

Sets the termios struct of the file handle ''fd'' from the options defined in ''options''. ''optional_actions'' specifies when the change will happen:
;TCSANOW: the configuration is changed immediately.
;TCSADRAIN: the configuration is changed after all the output written to ''fd'' has been transmitted. This prevents the change from corrupting in-transmission data.
;TCSAFLUSH: same as above but any data received and not read will be discarded.

----

=== Baud-Rate Setting ===
Reading and setting the baud rates (the line speeds) can be done via the '''tcgetattr'''() and '''tcsetattr'''() function. This can be done by reading or writing the necessary data into the &lt;tt&gt;struct termios&lt;/tt&gt;. However, this is a mess. The previous example for '''tcgetattr'''() demonstrates this.

Instead of accessing the data manually, it is highly recommended to use one of the following functions:

;cfgetispeed():Get line-in speed.
;cfgetospeed():Get line-out speed.
;cfsetispeed():Set line-in speed.
;cfsetospeed():Set line-out speed.
Which have the following signatures:

 #include &lt;termios.h&gt;
 speed_t cfgetispeed(const struct termios *attribs);

;speed:The input baud rate.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;attribs&lt;/nowiki&gt;:The &lt;tt&gt;struct termios&lt;/tt&gt; from which to extract the speed.

 #include &lt;termios.h&gt;
 speed_t cfgetospeed(const struct termios *attribs);

;speed:The output baud rate.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;attribs&lt;/nowiki&gt;:The &lt;tt&gt;struct termios&lt;/tt&gt; from which to extract the speed.

 #include &lt;termios.h&gt;
 int cfsetispeed(struct termios *attribs, speed_t speed);

;&lt;nowiki&gt;attribs&lt;/nowiki&gt;:The &lt;tt&gt;struct termios&lt;/tt&gt; in which the input baud rate  should be set.
;speed:The input baud rate that should be set.

The function returns
;0:If the speed could be set (encoded).
;-1:If the speed could not be set (e.g. if it is not a valid or supported speed value).

 #include &lt;termios.h&gt;
 int cfsetospeed(struct termios *attribs, speed_t speed);

;&lt;nowiki&gt;attribs&lt;/nowiki&gt;:The &lt;tt&gt;struct termios&lt;/tt&gt; in which the output baud rate  should be set.
;speed:The output baud rate that should be set.

The function returns
;0:If the speed could be set (encoded).
;-1:If the speed could not be set (e.g. if it is not a valid or supported speed value).

{{NOTE|note=If you wonder why the function names don't start with the &lt;tt&gt;tc&lt;/tt&gt; but with a &lt;tt&gt;cf&lt;/tt&gt; prefix, then you see one of the many idiosyncrasies of the Unix API. Someone apparently wanted to be clever and thought that since the functions need to deal with the &lt;tt&gt;c_flags&lt;/tt&gt; member of &lt;tt&gt;struct termios&lt;/tt&gt;, they should start with &lt;tt&gt;cf&lt;/tt&gt;. Thereby totally ignoring that the whole idea of these functions is to hide an implementation detail (&lt;tt&gt;c_flags&lt;/tt&gt;) - not exposing it. Talk about the wrong level of focus.}}

Here is a simple example for '''cfgetispeed'''(). '''cfgetospeed'''() works very similar:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 #include &lt;termios.h&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 int main(void) {
     struct termios attribs;
     speed_t speed;&lt;br&gt;
     if(tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &amp;attribs) &lt; 0) {
         perror(&quot;stdin&quot;);
         return EXIT_FAILURE;
     }&lt;br&gt;
     speed = cfgetispeed(&amp;attribs);
     printf(&quot;input speed: %lu\n&quot;, (unsigned long) speed);&lt;br&gt;
     return EXIT_SUCCESS;
 }

'''cfsetispeed'''() and '''cfsetospeed'''() work straight-forward, too. The following example sets the input speed of stdin to 9600 baud. Note, the setting will not be permanent, since the device might be reset at the end of the program:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 #include &lt;termios.h&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 int main(void) {
     struct termios attribs;
     speed_t speed;&lt;br&gt;
     /*
      * Get the current settings. This saves us from
      * having to initialize a struct termios from
      * scratch.
      */
     if(tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &amp;attribs) &lt; 0)
     {
         perror(&quot;stdin&quot;);
         return EXIT_FAILURE;
     }&lt;br&gt;
     /*
      * Set the speed data in the structure
      */
     if(cfsetispeed(&amp;attribs, B9600) &lt; 0)
     {
         perror(&quot;invalid baud rate&quot;);
         return EXIT_FAILURE;
     }&lt;br&gt;
     /*
      * Apply the settings.
      */
     if(tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &amp;attribs) &lt; 0)
     {
         perror(&quot;stdin&quot;);
         return EXIT_FAILURE;
     }&lt;br&gt;
     /* data transmision should happen here */&lt;br&gt;
     return EXIT_SUCCESS;
 }

== Modes ==

{{sectstub}}

=== Special Input Characters ===
{{sectstub}}
=== Canonical Mode ===
Everything is stored into a buffer and can be edited until a carriage return or line feed is entered. After the carriage return or line feed is pressed, the buffer is sent.

 options.c_lflag |= ICANON;

where:

;ICANON:Enables canonical input mode

=== Non-Canonical Mode ===
This mode will handle a fixed number of characters and allows for a character timer.In this mode input is not assembled into lines and input processing does not occur.Here we have to set two parameters time and minimum number of characters to be received before read is satisfied and these are set by setting VTIME and VMIN characters for example if we have to set Minimum number of characters as 4 and we don't want to use any timer then we can do so as follows-:
 options.c_cc[VTIME]=0;
 options.c_cc[VMIN]=4;
== Misc. ==

There are a few C functions that can be useful for terminal and serial I/O programming and are not part of the terminal I/O API. These are

 &lt;nowiki&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 char *ctermid(char ''*s'');

This function returns the device name of the current controlling terminal of the process as a string (e.g. &quot;/dev/tty01&quot;). This is useful for programs who want to open that terminal device directly in order to communicate with it, even if the controlling terminal association is removed later (because, for example, the process forks/execs to become a daemon process).&lt;br&gt; ''*s'' can either be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; or should point to a character array of at least ''L_ctermid'' bytes (the constant is also defined in ''stdio.h''). If ''*s'' is &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, then some internal static char array is used, otherwise the provided array is used. In both cases, a pointer to the first element of the char array is returned

 &lt;nowiki&gt;#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 int isatty(int ''fildes'')

Checks if the provided file descriptor represents a terminal device. This can e.g. be used to figure out if a device will understand the commands send via the terminal I/O API.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 char *ttyname (int ''fildes'');

This function returns the device name of a terminal device represented by a file descriptor as a string.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;#include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 ioctl(int ''fildes'', TIOCGWINSZ, struct winsize *);
 ioctl(int ''fildes'', TIOCSWINSZ, struct winsize *);

These I/O controls allow to get and set the window size of a terminal emulation, e.g. an ''xterm'' in pixel and character sizes. Typically the get variant (TIOCGWINSZ) is used in combination with a SIGWINCH signal handler. The signal handler gets called when the size has changed (e.g. because the user has resized the terminal emulation window), and the application uses the I/O control to get the new size.

==Example terminal program==
A simple terminal program with termios.h can look like this:

Warning: In this program the VMIN and VTIME flags are ignored because the O_NONBLOCK flag is set.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;termios.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt; // needed for memset

int main(int argc,char** argv)
{
        struct termios tio;
        struct termios stdio;
        int tty_fd;
        fd_set rdset;

        unsigned char c='D';

        printf(&quot;Please start with %s /dev/ttyS1 (for example)\n&quot;,argv[0]);
        memset(&amp;stdio,0,sizeof(stdio));

        tcsetattr(STDOUT_FILENO,TCSANOW,&amp;stdio);
        tcsetattr(STDOUT_FILENO,TCSAFLUSH,&amp;stdio);
        fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);       // make the reads non-blocking




        memset(&amp;tio,0,sizeof(tio));
        tio.c_iflag=0;
        tio.c_oflag=0;
        tio.c_cflag=CS8|CREAD|CLOCAL;           // 8n1, see termios.h for more information
        tio.c_lflag=0;
        tio.c_cc[VMIN]=1;
        tio.c_cc[VTIME]=5;

        tty_fd=open(argv[1], O_RDWR | O_NONBLOCK);      
        cfsetospeed(&amp;tio,B115200);            // 115200 baud
        cfsetispeed(&amp;tio,B115200);            // 115200 baud

        tcsetattr(tty_fd,TCSANOW,&amp;tio);
        while (c!='q')
        {
                if (read(tty_fd,&amp;c,1)&gt;0)        write(STDOUT_FILENO,&amp;c,1);              // if new data is available on the serial port, print it out
                if (read(STDIN_FILENO,&amp;c,1)&gt;0)  write(tty_fd,&amp;c,1);                     // if new data is available on the console, send it to the serial port
        }

        close(tty_fd);
}

==== Introduction ====

&lt;tt&gt;&lt;termio.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (note the missing 's') is the older System V terminal I/O API. It has been replaced by &lt;tt&gt;&lt;termios.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; on modern systems. It is still in use on many systems, e.g. on embedded Unix systems or those based on Unix System V. Often modern systems still also provide the old API, too.

All settings to a serial device are done via the ioctl''(2)'' system call, as opposite to the special functions as provided by &lt;tt&gt;&lt;termios.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. 

==== Special Characters ====

{{sectstub}}

* INTR (default Ctrl-C or ASCII ETX)
* QUIT (default Ctrl-\, or ASCII ES)
* ERASE (default backspace or ASCII BS)
* KILL (Ctrl-U, or ASCII NAK)
* EOF (Ctrl-D, or ASCII EOT)
* NL (ASCII LF)
* EOL (ASCII LF)
* STOP (Ctrl-S, or ASCII DC3)
* START (Ctrl-Q, or ASCII DC1)

==== Setting and Getting Parameters via Termio ====

===== Primary commands =====

The main commands for controlling serial (terminal) I/O with termio all use an ioctl() call of the form

 ioctl(int fileDescriptor, int termioCommand, struct termio *arg);

The following commands use this ioctl() form:

;TCGETA
:Get current parameters

 #include &lt;termio.h&gt;
     :
     .
 struct termio params;
 ioctl(fileDescriptor, TCGETA, &amp;params);

;TCSETA
:Set parameters immediately

;TCSETAW
:Set parameters when output is empty (waits with change until all buffered data has been sent).

;TCSETAF
:Wait until output is empty, then flush input, then set parameters.

The &lt;tt&gt;struct termio&lt;/tt&gt; argument as used in all the above &lt;tt&gt;''ioctl''(2)&lt;/tt&gt; command looks as it follows:

{{sectstub}}

;struct termio

 /*
  * Classic ''struct termio''. More modern Unix versions
  * contain additional information. Unix versions who
  * support termio and termios often use the same
  * structure for termio and termios, so termio
  * contains the full termios data on this systems.
  */
 #define NCC 8
 struct termio {
     int c_iflag;	 /* input modes	  */
     int c_oflag;	 /* output modes  */
     int c_cflag;	 /* control modes */
     int c_lflag;	 /* local modes	  */
     char c_cc[NCC];	 /* control chars */
 };

===== Additional Commands =====

The additional commands use the following form of ioctl() calls:

 ioctl(int fileDescriptor, int termioCommand, int arg);

The following termio commands use this form:

; TCSBRK
: Wait until output is empty (drain). Optionally, a break can be sent when this happens. In fact, this is the most common application 

 #include &lt;termio.h&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 /* Convenience macros for the waitBreak cmd argument */
 #define WAIT_N_BREAK  0
 #define WAIT_ONLY     1&lt;br&gt;
 /*
  * Function for waiting until output is empty and opt. sending a break 
  */
 tcWaitBreak(int fileDescriptor, int cmd) {
     ioctl(fileDescriptor, TCSBRK, cmd);
 }&lt;br&gt;
 /*
  * Send break when output is empty 
  */
 tcBreak(int fileDescriptor) {
      tcWaitBreak(fileDescriptor, WAIT_N_BREAK);
 }

; TCXONC
: Start or stop the output.

 #include &lt;termio.h&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 /* Convenience macros for the start/stop cmd argument */
 #define STOP  0
 #define START 1&lt;br&gt;
 /*
  * Function for starting /stopping output 
  */
 tcStartStop(int fileDescriptor, int cmd) {
     ioctl(fileDescriptor, TCXONC, cmd);
 }&lt;br&gt;
 /*
  * stop output 
  */
 tcStop(int fileDescriptor) {
     tcStartStop(fileDescriptor, STOP);
 }&lt;br&gt;
 /*
  * start output
  */
 tcStart(int fileDescriptor) {
     tcStartStop(fileDescriptor, START);
 }


; TCFLSH
: Flush the input, output, or both queues.

 #include &lt;termio.h&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 /* Convenience macros for the flush cmd argument */
 #define FLUSH_IN   0
 #define FLUSH_OUT  1
 #define FLUSH_BOTH 2&lt;br&gt;
 /*
  * Function for flushing a terminal/serial device
  */
 tcFlush(int fileDescriptor, int cmd) {
     ioctl(fileDescriptor, TCFLSH, cmd);
 }

This line is also called the Fantasy variation. White bolsters his f3-pawn and hopes to obtain a full pawn centre should black take at e4. It has been used by Alexander Morozevich, the second-highest ranked player in the world (July 2008), with success. It can lead to original positions or transpose into a mainline French Defence with the moves: 3...e6 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. e5 Nfd7 6. f4 c5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Armenian}}

This section deals primarily with the Eastern Armenian dialect, the primary dialect of the country of Armenia. During Armenia's time as part of the Soviet Union, the U.S.S.R. took steps to highly standardize the language. As a result, the grammar may seem rather systematic and tedious at times. However, because of the standarization, exceptions are very rare, and once a grammatical rule is memorized, it is almost universally applicable. Exceptions are so rare, in fact, that the majority of them will be discussed in subsequent sections.


== Infinitives ==

Every Armenian verb consists of a root and one of five possible infinitive suffixes:'''-ել''','''-ալ''','''-անալ''', '''-անել''', or '''-ենալ'''. The root consists of everything in the word up until the suffix, and, with very few exceptions, will never change, no matter the tense. 

Armenian, like many languages in its language-family, requires strict subject-verb agreement, which is usually indicated by the suffix of the conjugated verb, eliminating the need for personal pronouns.

== Present Tense ==

There is only one present tense in Armenian, and though it's structured like English's present continuous tense, it can act as the present continuous (I am walking) or the simple present (I walk).

The Present tense is one of the few tenses in Armenian which has a single suffix, '''-ում''',  distributed equally, independent of the subject of the verb. The subject-verb agreement is then manifested through placement of a conjugated &quot;to be&quot; after the verb. 

'''Լինել (to be)'''

'''եu եմ'''-I am
(''yes em'')

'''դու եu'''-you(sing.) are
(''doo es'')

'''նա է'''-he/she/it is
(''nah eh'')

'''մենք ենք'''-we are
(''menk enk'')

'''դուք եք'''-you(pl./form.) are
(''dook ek'')

'''նրանք են'''-they are
(''nərank en'')


Example: In '''կարդալ'''  (to read), the suffix '''-ալ''' is replaced by the present tense marker '''-ում''', followed by one of the six listed present forms of &quot;to be&quot;.

'''Եu կարդում  եմ'''-I reading am
(''yes kartoom em'')

'''Դու կարդում  եu'''-you (sing.) reading are
(''doo kartoom es'')

'''Նա կարդում  է'''-he/she/it reading is
(''nah kartoom eh'')

'''Մենք կարդում  ենք'''-we reading are
(''menk kartoom enk'')

'''Դուք կարդում  եք'''-you (pl./form.) reading are
(''dook kartoom ek'')

'''Նրանք կարդում  են'''-they reading are
(''nərank kartoom en'')


If the verb ending is polysyllabic ('''-անալ''', '''-անել''', '''-ենալ'''), then only the final syllable, starting with the second vowel, is replaced by '''-ում'''.

Hence, '''մահանալ '''(to die) becomes '''մաhանում''', and so on.


'''Negation'''

To negate the verb, simply add a '''չ''' to the beginning of the present &quot;to be&quot; and switch its position to be before the verb. 

Example: '''Նրանք չեն ուտում'''-They aren't eating
(''nərank chen ootoom'')


'''Irregulars'''

Exceptions occur in monosyllabic verbs, such as '''գալ '''(to come) and '''տալ '''(to give) where the root is only marked by a single consonant. In cases such as these, the verb remains as it is, and the suffix '''-իu''' is added onto the end.

Example: '''Մենք գալիu ենք'''-we coming are (''menk galees enk'')


Another exception lies in the verb '''գիտենալ '''(to know). This verb is conjugated in the present by simply tacking on the present form of &quot;to be&quot; onto the end of the root '''գիտ'''.

Example: '''Եu գիտեմ'''-I know (''yes geetem'')

== Future Tense ==


There are two versions of the future tense in Armenian. The first and most common is marked by the prefix '''կ-''' added onto the root, as well as the final consonant in the infinitive suffix being replaced by the subject's corresponding end-marker.

'''Եu  -մ'''

'''Դու   -u'''

'''Նա   -n/a

'''Մենք  -նք'''

'''Դուք -ք'''

'''Նրանք -ն'''


Example: '''Հիանալ''' (to admire) becomes:

'''Ես կհիանամ''' I will admire (''yes kәheeyanam'')

'''Դու կհիանաս''' you (sing.) will admire (''doo kәheeyanas'')

'''Նա  կհիանա'''  he/she/it will admire (''nah kәheeyanah'')

'''Մենք կհիանանք''' we will admire (''menk kәheeyanank'')

'''Դուք կհիանաք''' you (pl. form.) will admire (''dook kәheeyanak'')

'''Նրանք կհիանան''' they will admire (''nrank kәheeyanan'')


If the verb is an '''-ել'''  or '''-անել'''  verb, and the subject is thid-person singular ('''նա'''), as usual, the '''լ ''' is dropped, but the '''ե''' that precedes it is changed to '''ի'''. So in the case of, for example, '''խոսել '''(to speak), the third-person singular version of it in the future tense would be '''կխոսի '''(''kәkhosee'') rather than '''կխոսե'''.


To negate, conjugate the verb as if it were in the third-person singular future, but without the '''կ''', and put the a negated present tense &quot;to be&quot; before the verb.

Example: '''Դու չես գնա''' you will not go (''doo ches gənah'')


Another way to express the future tense would be to simply add an '''-ու''' to the end of the infinitive verb and follow it with a present tense &quot;to be&quot;. 

Example: '''Մենք հանդիպելու ենք''' (''menk handeepeloo yenk'') where the verb is '''hանդիպել''' (to meet).

This would be the equivalent to saying &quot;we will be meeting&quot;, whereas '''մենք կհանդիպենք''' (''menk kәhandeepenk'') would more accurately be translated as simply &quot;we will meet&quot;.


To negate, simply follow the same procedure as negating present tense verbs.


'''Դու չես գնալու''' you will not be going (''doo ches gənaloo'')

== Past Tense ==


Armenian has a number of past tenses, all of which will be discussed in detail.

'''Preterite (simple past)'''

Just like English, this tense has the most variation and exceptions (though, generally these variations occur in groups rather than random exceptions, and the number of irregulars is not even close to the amount that exist in English). The bulk of Armenian verbs are conjugated similarly in the preterite tense, as the bulk of Armenian verbs are polysyllabic and end in either '''-ել''' or '''-ալ''' (as we saw in the present tense, irregulars tend to be entirely monosyllabic, or end with a polysyllabic infinitive stem).

In the case of '''-ել''' and '''-ալ''' verbs, remove the '''լ''' and replace it with the corresponding ending:


'''Եu  -ցի'''

'''Դու   -ցիր'''

'''Նա   -ց'''

'''Մենք  -ցինք'''

'''Դուք -ցիք'''

'''Նրանք -ցին'''


Example: '''Ասել''' (to say)


'''Եu ասեցի''' I said (''yes ahsetsee'')

'''Դու  ասեցիր''' you (sing.) said (''doo ahsetseer'')

'''Նա  ասեց''' he/she/it said (''nah ahsets'')

'''Մենք ասեցինք''' we said (''menk ahsetseenk'')

'''Դուք ասեցիք''' you (pl./form.) said (''dook ahsetseek'')

'''Նրանք ասեցին''' they said (''nərank ahsetseen'')


'''Մնալ''' (to stay/remain)


'''Եu մնացի''' I stayed (''yes mənahtsee'')

'''Դու  մնացիր''' you (sing.) stayed (''doo mənahtseer'')

'''Նա  մնաց''' he/she/it stayed (''nah mənahts'')

'''Մենք մնացինք''' we stayed (''menk mənahtseenk'')

'''Դուք մնացիք''' you (pl./form.) stayed (''dook mənahtseek'')

'''Նրանք մնացին''' they stayed (''nərank mənahtseen'')


Verbs which end with '''-անալ''', '''-անել''', or '''-ենալ''' are conjugated by replacing the '''նալ''' in the suffix with the corresponding stem:


'''Եu  -ցա'''

'''Դու   -ցար'''

'''Նա   -ցավ'''

'''Մենք  -ցանք'''

'''Դուք -ցաք'''

'''Նրանք -ցան'''


Example: '''Ստանալ''' (to receive)

'''Եu ստացա''' I received (''yes stahtsah'')

'''Դու  ստացար''' you (sing.) received (''doo stahtsar'')

'''Նա  ստացավ''' he/she/it received (''nah stahtsav'')

'''Մենք ստացանք''' we received (''menk stahtsank'')

'''Դուք ստացաք''' you (pl./form.) received (''dook stahtsak'')

'''Նրանք ստացան''' they received (''nərank stahtsahn'')



Many verbs which end in '''-նել''' (but not '''-անել''') are conjugated similarly to '''-անալ''' verbs, but without the '''աց'''.

Example: '''Հասնել''' (to arrive)

'''Եu hասա'''

'''Դու  hասար'''

'''Նա  hասավ'''

'''Մենք hասանք'''

'''Դուք hասաք'''

'''Նրանք hասան'''


There is also a family of verbs in Armenian which end in '''-ցնել'''. These verbs in all other tenses are treated the same as normal '''-ել''' verbs (the '''ցն''' simply being treated as part of the root). These verbs indicate a caused action. For example, where '''սովորել''' (''sovorel'') means &quot;to learn&quot;, '''սովորեցնել''' (''sovoretsnel'') means &quot;to cause to learn&quot; or in other words &quot;to teach&quot;. 

In the preterite tense, the '''ն''' in the stem becomes '''ր''' and from there it is treated like a normal '''-ել''' verb. So the first-person preterite of '''սովորեցնել''' becomes '''սովորեցրեցի'''.


'''Irregulars'''

Just as in the present tense, monosyllabic verbs tend to function under different rules. '''Գալ '''(to come) and '''տալ '''(to give) are the only two widely used monosyllabic verbs. There conjugations in the preterite are as follows:


 
'''Գալ  (to come)'''

'''Եu եկա''' I came (''yes yekah'')

'''Դու  եկար''' you (sing.) came (''doo yekar'')

'''Նա  եկավ''' he/she/it came (''nah yekav'')

'''Մենք եկանք''' we came (''menk yekank'')

'''Դուք եկաք''' you (pl./form.) came (''dook yekak'')

'''Նրանք եկան''' they came (''nərank yekan'')


'''Տալ (to give)'''

'''Եu տվեցի''' I gave (''yes təvetsee'')

'''Դու  տվեցիր''' you (sing.) gave (''doo təvetseer'')

'''Նա  տվեց''' he/she/it gave (''nah təvets'')

'''Մենք տվեցինք''' we gave (''menk təvetseenk'')

'''Դուք տվեցիք''' you (pl./form.) gave (''dook təvetseek'')

'''Նրանք տվեցին''' they gave (''nərank təvetseen'')



'''Ուտել''' is also conjugated irregularly.

'''Եu կերա'''

'''Դու  կերար'''

'''Նա  կերավ'''

'''Մենք կերանք'''

'''Դուք կերաք'''

'''Նրանք կերան'''


The verb '''լինել''' (to be) can also be used to mean &quot;to happen&quot;. When used in that context, it is conjugated as a normal verb, but an irregular one. The root turns into '''եղ-''' and it is conjugated the same as the preterite of '''գալ '''. Generally, the only practical sense in which the word would ever be used in this context is in the third-person singular: '''եղավ''' (''yeghav''), which literally means &quot;it happened&quot;, as in &quot;consider it done.&quot; Armenian speakers often say it in the same context as the English expression &quot;okay&quot; or &quot;whatever&quot;.

== Imperfect Past ==

To express the imperfect past tense, one would need to know the past conjugations of &quot;to be&quot;.

'''եu էի'''-I was
(''yes eyee'')

'''դու էիր'''-you(sing.) were
(''doo eyeer'')

'''նա էր'''-he/she/it was
(''nah ehr'')

'''մենք էինք'''-we were
(''menk eyeenk'')

'''դուք էիք'''-you(pl./form.) were
(''dook eyeek'')

'''նրանք էին'''-they were
(''nərank eyeen'')


This is the tense through which one expresses continuous action in the past, such as &quot;I ''was'' walking&quot; or &quot;we ''were'' talking&quot;. The rule is the same as in English. The verb is conjugated the same way as it is in the present tense (replacing the stem with '''-ում''') and followed then followed by the past conjugation of &quot;to be&quot;.

So whereas '''ես խմում եմ''' (''yes khəmoom em'') means ''I drinking am'', '''ես խմում ''էի''''' (''yes khəmoom eyee'') means ''I drinking was''.


Negation follows exactly the same rule as in the present tense.

'''Ես բամբասում էի''' (''yes bambasoom eyee'') ''I was gossipping'' becomes '''ես չէի բամբասում''' (''yes cheyee bambasoom'') ''I wasn't gossipping''.

== Perfect Tense ==

The perfect tense is a way to express the past which is almost as widely used as the preterite. It sees a much more frequent distribution than its English equivalent.

If the verb is a standard '''-ել''' verb (no '''ն''' or '''ցն''' preceding it), then it does not change from its infinitive form and either a present or a past form of &quot;to be&quot; is placed after it.

'''Մենք ընտրել ենք''' (''menk untrel enk'') we have chosen

or

'''Մենք ընտրել էինք''' (''menk untrel eyeenk'') we had chosen


To negate, add '''չ''' to the beginning of the &quot;to be&quot; conjugation and place the word before the verb.

'''Նրանք չէին սկսել''' (''nərank cheyeen skəsel'') ''they hadn't started''


If a '''ն''' precedes the '''-ել''' stem, such as in '''hասնել''' (to arrive), the '''ն''' is simply removed from the verb, becoming 

'''Դու hասել ես''' (''doo hahsel es'') ''you (sing.) have arrived''


The stem in all '''-ալ''', '''-անալ''', and '''-անել''' verbs becomes '''-ացել'''.


Example: '''Կշտանալ''' (to become full from eating) becomes '''կշտացել'''


Just as in the preterite tense, the '''ն''' in any '''-ցնել''' verb simply changes to a '''ր'''.

Example: '''Հեշտացնել''' (to simplify/make something easier) becomes '''հեշտացրել'''.


The stem in any '''-ենալ''' verb becomes '''-եցել'''.


'''Irregulars'''


The most commonly used irregulars are '''գալ ''' (to come), '''տալ''' (to give), '''լինել''' (to be), and '''ուտել''' (to eat).

'''գալ ''' becomes '''եկել'''

'''տալ''' becomes '''տվել'''

'''լինել''' becomes '''եղել'''

'''ուտել''' becomes '''կերել'''


== Conditional ==

This tense can be used to express &quot;would&quot;, and it can be used to denote future or past conditions, such as &quot;I would go&quot; or &quot;I would ''have gone''&quot;.

The conditional tense is expressed similarly to the future tense. The '''կ''' prefix is still tacked on to the beginning of the root, and the final '''լ''' is replaced the corresponding end marker.

For '''-ել''' and '''-անել''' verbs:

'''Եu  -ի''' 

'''Դու   -իր'''

'''Նա   -ր'''

'''Մենք  -ինք'''

'''Դուք -իք'''

'''Նրանք -ին'''

Example: '''Ուղարկել''' (to send)

'''Եu կուղարկեի''' (''yes k'ooghark'eyee'') ''I would send/would have sent''

'''Դու կուղարկեիր''' (''doo k'ooghark'eyeer'') ''you (sing.) would send/would have sent''

'''Նա  կուղարկեր''' (''nah k'ooghark'er'') ''he/she/it would send/would have sent''

'''Մենք կուղարկեինք''' (''menk k'ooghark'eyeenk'') ''we would send/would have sent''

'''Դուք կուղարկեիք''' (''dook k'ooghark'eyeek'') ''you (pl./form.) would send/would have sent''

'''Նրանք կուղարկեին''' (''nərank k'ooghark'eyeen'') ''they would send/would have sent''


For '''-ալ''', '''-անալ''', and '''-ենալ''' verbs, use the same endings, but precede them with '''յ''', as Armenian phonetics does not allow for a shift from '''ա''' to '''ե''' without a semi-vowel between them (the exception being the third-person singular, as its conjugation does not contain '''ի''').

Example: '''Ուշանալ''' (to be late)

'''Եu  կուշանայի'''

'''Դու   կուշանայիր'''

'''Նա   կուշանար'''

'''Մենք  կուշանայինք'''

'''Դուք կուշանայիք'''

'''Նրանք կուշանային'''


== Reflexives ==

To express reflexive action (''I was understood'' rather than ''I understood''), a '''վ''' is inserted into the verb, in most cases just before the suffix. Provided below are examples from all verb families.


'''Հիշել''' (to remember)

'''Հիշվել''' (to be remembered)

Present: '''Դու հիշվում ես''' ''doo heeshvoom es'' You are remembered (lit. you are being remembered)

Preterite: '''Նա հիշվեց''' ''nah heeshvets'' he/she/it was remembered

Future: '''Մենք կհիշվենք''' ''menk kəheeshvenk'' We will be remembered

Perfect: '''Նրանք hիշվել են''' ''nərank heeshvel en'' They have been remembered 


'''Կարդալ''' (to read)

'''Կարդացվել''' (to be read)

Present: '''Գիրքը կարդացվում է''' ''geerkə k'artatsvoom eh'' The book is read (lit. the book is being read)

Preterite: '''Գիրքը կարդացվեց''' ''geerkə k'artatsvets'' The book was read

Future: '''Գիրքը կկարդացվի''' ''geerkə kək'artatsvee'' The book will be read

Perfect: '''Գիրքը կարդացվել է''' ''geerkə k'artatsvel eh'' The book has been read


'''Դժվարացնել''' (to make difficult)

'''Դժվարացվել''' (to be made difficult)

Present: '''Սրանք դժվարացվում են''' ''sərank dəzhvaratsvoom en'' These are being made difficult

Preterite: '''Սրանք դժվարացվեցին''' ''sərank dəzhvaratsvetseen'' These were made difficult

Future: '''Սրանք կդժվարացվեն''' ''sərank kədəzhvaratsven'' These will be made difficult

Perfect: '''Սրանք դժվարացվել են''' ''sərank dəzhvaratsvel en'' These have been made difficult


'''Խոստանալ''' (to promise)

'''Խոստացվել''' (to be promised)

Present: '''Դա խոստացվում է''' ''dah khostatsvoom eh'' That is being promised

Preterite: '''Դա խոստացվեց''' ''dah khostatsvets'' That was promised

Future:  '''Դա կխոստացվի''' ''dah kəkhostatsvee'' That will be promised

Perfect: '''Դա խոստացվել է''' ''dah khostatsvel eh'' That has been promised


'''Խոստովանել''' (to confess/admit)

'''Խոստովացվել''' (to be confessed/admitted)

Present: '''Նրա մեղքերը խոստովացվում են''' ''nərah meghkerə khostovatsvoom en'' His sins are being confessed

Preterite: '''Նրա մեղքերը խոստովացվեցին''' ''nərah meghkerə khostovatsvetseen'' His sins were confessed

Future: '''Նրա մեղքերը կխոստովացվեն''' ''nərah meghkerə kəkhostovatsven''  His sins will be confessed

Perfect: '''Նրա մեղքերը  խոստովացվել են''' ''nərah meghkerə khostovatsvel en'' His sins have been confessed 


'''Կամենալ''' (to will/desire that something happen)

'''Կամեցվել''' (to be willed/desired)

== Cases ==

Armenian has seven grammatical cases: nominative, dative, accusative, locative, ablative, genitive, and instrumental.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{displaytitle|title=Wikibooks:What is Wikijunior?}}{{policy|WB:WIWJ}}

The aim of '''Wikijunior''' is to produce non-fiction books for children from birth to age twelve. These books could take the form of macropedias, textbooks, or primers. 

Wikijunior is a source of books for children written by an international community of volunteers. It is built on certain core values. Wikijunior is:
*'''kid friendly'''. Our books are written with children in mind. The subjects of our books are chosen because they are appealing to kids. These books are richly illustrated with photographs, diagrams, sketches, and original drawings. 
*'''collaborative'''. Wikijunior books do not have just one author, instead they are the product of many interested people working together. 
*'''fun'''. We write books that are easy to understand and age-appropriate. The writing style is light and friendly.
*'''reliable'''. Books present factual information that is verifiable and avoid opinion, original research, and fiction.
*'''open'''. The world is invited to join in and write, edit, and rewrite each article and book to improve its content.  Our books are distributed free of charge under the terms of the Creative Commons Share-Alike License.

If you discover a book or article that doesn't meet these standards, please [[WB:BOLD|be bold]] and fix it!

Development will happen online here at Wikibooks, and some of the finished books will go into print. In the future, a static online version of Wikijunior will be set up as a new project and &quot;completed&quot; versions will go there. However even the &quot;completed&quot; versions will be updated from time to time with changes posted to Wikibooks.

==Relationship with Wikibooks== 
Wikijunior is a part of the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikibooks and is subject to their rules and policies.  Wikijunior also has its own set of guidelines in addition to those.  Sometimes Wikijunior policy differs from policy on the rest of Wikibooks &amp;mdash; for example, a macropedia (an in-depth encyclopedia on a specific topic) is allowed on Wikijunior even though it is not generally allowed on the rest of Wikibooks.
&lt;!-- I'M NOT SURE THIS LAST PART IS NEEDED, SO I'M WRITING IT BUT LEAVING IT COMMENTED OUT FOR NOW
Wikibooks policies should mention when they make allowances for Wikijunior; but if they don't mention it, ask about the seeming contradiction on the Wikibooks policy's talk page, or at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General|Wikibooks general reading room]]. --&gt;

A fracture of the distal radius is the most common skeletal injury which is referred for acute orthopedic management.  Recently volar locking plates as well as more comprehensive plating systems have come to effect the mode of treatment for this injury and in typical fashion have been adopted rather broadly to the treatment of an injury which can often be well managed by closed manipulation and immobilization.  Decision making regarding choice of treatment is governed by context, ease of care, risk and benefit and expectation of outcome.  What may have been an acceptable result allowing for deformity may no longer be considered acceptable.  Traditionally the treatment goal is a pain free wrist achieved within a predictable and reasonable time frame allowing for return of strong grip, range of motion of the wrist and fingers.  This result is still readily achievable by closed means for the majority of fractures of the distal radius, especially those which result from what is the most common mechanism, that being low energy trauma from a fall.  

Patient expectation tends to shift.  They will expect to hear about an operative alternative which offers early motion in a removable splint and a more predictable restoration of anatomical relationships and perhaps and enhanced prospect for a return to full function.  They will increasingly be familiar with friends and family similarly treated.  Other patients will remain pleased to hear that surgery may be avoidable and will be quite willing to put up with some short term inconvenience and even the prospect of residual deformity in order to avoid the cost and risk of surgery.  

The process of informed consent will reveal which sentiment will hold sway in the patients decision making and thus skill in achieving the desired result by either operative or closed means will continue.  The artful orthopedist will acquire a sense of which direction is best to advise weighing many factors in a calculus he or she will be at a loss to explain.  Sometimes the wrong choice will be made and the patient will experience difficulties despite the best assessment that can be offered.  An unexpectedly poor outcome will likely effect the subsequent treatment advise of the orthopedist and in this way his or her practice pattern will evolve.  A ruptured tendon or infection subsequent to plating, or a malunion and stiff fingers following closed management.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Vectors (spatial)===

A [[wikipedia:Vector (spatial)|'''vector''']] is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction. Vectors can be visualized as arrows. The following figure shows what we mean by the ''components'' &lt;math&gt;(a_x,a_y,a_z)&lt;/math&gt; of a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[image:Vector1.png|400px]]

The ''sum'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; of two vectors has the components &lt;math&gt;(a_x+b_x,a_y+b_y,a_z+b_z).&lt;/math&gt;

*Explain the addition of vectors in terms of arrows.

The [[wikipedia:Dot product|''dot product'']] of two vectors is the number

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=a_xb_x+a_yb_y+a_zb_z.&lt;/math&gt;

Its importance arises from the fact that it is invariant under [[wikipedia:Rotation (mathematics)|rotations]]. To see this, we calculate

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b})\cdot(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b})=
(a_x+b_x)^2+(a_y+b_y)^2+(a_z+b_z)^2=&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_x^2+a_y^2+a_z^2+b_x^2+b_y^2+b_z^2+2\,(a_xb_x+a_yb_y+a_zb_z)=
\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{b}+2\,\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}.&lt;/math&gt;

According to [[wikipedia:Pythagorean theorem|Pythagoras]], the magnitude of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{a_x^2+a_y^2+a_z^2}.&lt;/math&gt; If we use a different coordinate system, the components of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; will be different: &lt;math&gt;(a_x,a_y,a_z)\rightarrow(a'_x,a'_y,a'_z).&lt;/math&gt; But if the new system of axes differs only by a rotation and/or [[wikipedia:Translation (geometry)|translation]] of the axes, the magnitude of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; will remain the same:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{a_x^2+a_y^2+a_z^2}=\sqrt{(a'_x)^2+(a'_y)^2+(a'_z)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The squared magnitudes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{b},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b})\cdot(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b})&lt;/math&gt; are invariant under rotations, and so, therefore, is the product &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}.&lt;/math&gt;

*Show that the dot product is also invariant under translations.

Since by a ''scalar'' we mean a number that is invariant under certain transformations (in this case rotations and/or translations of the coordinate axes), the dot product is also known as (a) ''scalar product''. Let us prove that

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=ab\cos\theta,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}.&lt;/math&gt; To do so, we pick a coordinate system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; in which &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}=(a,0,0).&lt;/math&gt; In this coordinate system &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=ab_x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b_x=b\cos\theta.&lt;/math&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar, and since scalars are invariant under rotations and translations, the result &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=ab\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt; (which makes no reference to any particular frame) holds in all frames that are rotated and/or translated relative to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}.&lt;/math&gt;

We now introduce the ''unit vectors'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat x},\mathbf{\hat y},\mathbf{\hat z},&lt;/math&gt; whose directions are defined by the coordinate axes. They are said to form an ''orthonormal basis''. ''Ortho'' because they are mutually orthogonal:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\hat x}\cdot\mathbf{\hat y}=\mathbf{\hat x}\cdot\mathbf{\hat z}=\mathbf{\hat y}\cdot\mathbf{\hat z}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

''Normal'' because they are unit vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\hat x}\cdot\mathbf{\hat x}=\mathbf{\hat y}\cdot\mathbf{\hat y}= \mathbf{\hat z}\cdot\mathbf{\hat z}=1.&lt;/math&gt;

And ''basis'' because every vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a [[wikipedia:Linear combination|''linear combination'']] of these three vectors — that is, a sum in which each basis vector appears once, multiplied by the corresponding component of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; (which may be&amp;nbsp;0):

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v}=v_x\mathbf{\hat x}+v_y\mathbf{\hat y}+v_z\mathbf{\hat z}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is readily seen that &lt;math&gt;v_x=\mathbf{\hat x}\cdot\mathbf{v},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;v_y=\mathbf{\hat y}\cdot\mathbf{v},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;v_z=\mathbf{\hat z}\cdot\mathbf{v},&lt;/math&gt; which is why we have that

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{\hat x}\,(\mathbf{\hat x}\cdot\mathbf{v})+\mathbf{\hat y}\,(\mathbf{\hat y}\cdot\mathbf{v})+\mathbf{\hat z}\,(\mathbf{\hat z}\cdot\mathbf{v}).&lt;/math&gt;

Another definition that is useful (albeit only in a 3-dimensional space) is the [[wikipedia:Cross product|''cross product'']] of two vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}=(a_yb_z-a_zb_y)\,\mathbf{\hat x}+(a_zb_x-a_xb_z)\,\mathbf{\hat y}+(a_xb_y-a_yb_x)\,\mathbf{\hat z}.&lt;/math&gt;

*Show that the cross product is antisymmetric: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}=-\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a consequence, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{a}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

* Show that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot(\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b})=\mathbf{b}\cdot(\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b})=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to both &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}.&lt;/math&gt;

*Show that the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;ab\sin\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}.&lt;/math&gt; Hint: use a coordinate system in which &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}=(a,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}= (b\cos\alpha,b\sin\alpha,0).&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;ab\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is also the area&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of the parallelogram&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b},&lt;/math&gt; we can think of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; as a vector of magnitude&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;P.&lt;/math&gt; Since the cross product yields a vector, it is also known as ''vector product''.

(We save ourselves the trouble of showing that the cross product is invariant under translations and rotations of the coordinate axes, as is required of a vector. Let us however note in passing that if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; are polar vectors, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is an axial vector. Under a reflection (for instance, the inversion of a coordinate axis) an ordinary (or ''polar'') vector is invariant, whereas an [[wikipedia:Pseudovector|''axial vector'']] changes its sign.)

Here is a useful relation involving both scalar and vector products:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c})=\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{a})-(\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Very Impressive ==

Wow, this is an amazing wikibook! I think it's the best one I've seen on the whole of Wikiboks! I am trying to add you to the languages bookshelf to make it more visible. [[User:Poppy|Poppy]] 20:17, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

::Thank you for your comment (which I didn't see until today, unfortunately). Cheers, Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 11:54, 25 August 2007 (UTC)

==Navigation==
I must also agree with the above statement, this is probobly the best language wikibook. Anyway, it would be helpful if at the bottom of each lesson page there was a naviagtion templete to go to the next lesson. It is a little inconvenient to have to scroll up to the top of the page. Thanks!--[[User:122.164.151.90|122.164.151.90]] 06:34, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

==Exercises==
This is certainly the best language wikibook I've seen so far. I have no background in language teaching apart from learning English, some Latin and currently Spanish (apart from failed attempts to learn French and Italian); however, I'm currently working on a &quot;wikibooklet&quot; for a Spanish audio course under a creative commons license, i.e., I'm writing transcripts of the Spanish dialogues, vocabulary lists, and exercises for each lesson. I have some questions about how to do this:
* I noticed that many of the templates of the Miskitu wikibook, which reveal answers/translations etc. by clicking, always reveal a bunch of answers at the same time. Is this done on purpose? Wouldn't it be better to reveal the answers individually in order to give the learner an immediate feedback for each question without revealing the answers of all questions?
* In [[Miskito/Method#Composing mini-exercises]] there is a list of nine exercise types:
:# True or false: You give Miskito sentences, the learner says if what they say is write or wrong.
:# Order the sentences: You give a series of Miskito sentences out of order, the learner puts them into the right order to form a coherent text.
:# Miskito-English translation: You give the Miskito, the learner gives the English.
:# Order the words: You give a Miskito sentence with the words in the wrong order, the learner puts them in the right order to form a sentence.
:# Sentence transformation: You give a sentence, the learner changes it in the way you specify (e.g. changing singular to plural).
:# Filling in blanks: You give Miskito sentences with a part missing, the learner provides the missing part and completes the sentence.
:# Combining: You give one or more elements of a Miskito sentence (but not the whole sentence), the learner gives the whole sentence combining or manipulating the elements in the way you have specified.
:# English-Miskito translation: You give the English, the learner gives the Miskito.
:# Answering questions: You ask questions (in Miskito), the learner answers them (in Miskito).
:I've ordered the types of exercises according to their difficulty (does everyone agree on the order?). My first question would be: does it make sense to have many different types of exercises just for the sake of variation? I recently worked through a Spanish audio course, which had the same four kinds of exercises for each lesson in a fixed order (1. translation of English words to Spanish words, 2. translation of sentences from English to Spanish, 3. role play (similar to asking and answering question in the foreign language), and 4. multiple-choice answers about the text) and my impression was that this fixed scheme of exercises establishes a certain routine, which I liked as a learner because after three lessons I knew exactly how the exercises work. 
*My second question would be, which exercises are the most important ones if I have limited resources to create them? If the goal of the exercises is to give users feed back on their abilities, I would think that English-foreign language translation and answering questions in the foreign language are the two most important exercises. If users can do this, they almost certainly are able to do all the other exercises. Or am I missing something? 
*In my experience a problem with answering questions in the foreign language is that I'm often missing vocabulary to express what I want to say and I need someone to check my answer because it is very often too different from the one or two possible answers that are proposed in a textbook. Thus, I would think that this type of exercise is more appropriate for a class room situation with a teacher than for a self-studying course.
*Thus, I'm currently planning to have only translations from English to the foreign language. However, I realize that this might be rather difficult for users and therefore a bit frustrating. Therefore, the exercises come in three flavors of different difficulty: 1. given the English translation of one sentence of the lesson text, the user only has to remember the original sentence of the lesson text in the foreign language, 2. same as 1. with variations of the lesson text (but using the same vocabulary and exactly the same verb forms), 3. same as 1. but varying the person and gender (singular and plural, formal and informal, masculine and feminine). I think these restrictions simplify these translation exercises to a very manageable level while still practicing and testing the important ability to translate from English to the foreign language. (I should mention that the whole course I'm working on is for beginners; a more advanced course should probably provide more difficult translation exercises.) An important feature of this choice is that the creation of these kinds of exercises appears to be quite manageable even for a non-native speaker of the language taught by a text book. Any comments on this choice would be very welcome! --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 13:18, 29 September 2008 (UTC)

==Sound?==
This is an interesting featured book.  But it would be really nice if at some point you can arrange to collect matching sound files for the exercises from a native speaker.  Personally I'd just be curious how the sound changes in a non-European language with different word order when people say things with different meanings but the same text, e.g. &quot;Good job!&quot; honestly vs. sarcastically, or how questions are asked with perhaps non-rising tone endings (e.g. English &quot;Would you like me to put it there?&quot; when &quot;there&quot; is already a known location and stress goes on &quot;like&quot; or &quot;put&quot;).

==Naming objects in the database==
{{JET:TOC}}
As with most other SQL databases, care is recommended when naming database objects such as tables, columns, indexes, views and stored procedures. Using names outside the normal naming conventions can cause problems when writing SQL code to handle those objects, requiring such names to be qualified in SQL code. The conventions in JET are:

* names must begin with an alphabetic character (a-z or A-Z)
* names must contain only alpha-numeric characters or the underscore
* names must not be [[#Reserved words|reserved words]]

==Qualifying special names==

There are occasions when objects are given names that cause problems in SQL statements, either by including special characters like spaces, or by using reserved words. Sometimes this is legitimate, other times it isn't, but either way the situation needs to be handled.

In such circumstances, the object names can be qualified in one of the following ways:
* wrapping the name in (square) brackets, &lt;code&gt;[...]&lt;/code&gt;
* wrapping the name in left single quotes (grave accents), &lt;code&gt;`...`&lt;/code&gt;

Here are some examples:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table `Name With Spaces` (
 `Complex Column Name a/b %` single, 
 [Text] text(20))
go

Insert Into `Name With Spaces` (`Complex Column Name a/b %`, [Text]) 
 Values (1.45, 'First attempt')
go

Select `Complex Column Name a/b %`, [Text] As [Output Complex Text Name]
 From `Name With Spaces`
go
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Complex Column Name a/b % Output Complex Text Name
------------------------- ------------------------
1.45                      First attempt
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Constants==

===Text constants===

Text constants can either be written with single quote (apostrophe) delimiters or double quote delimiters. Any instances of the delimiters used within the text constant need to be doubled.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Select 'Eat the &quot;food&quot; at O''Malley''s' As T1, 
 &quot;Eat the &quot;&quot;food&quot;&quot; at O'Malley's&quot; As T2
go
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
T1                             T2
------------------------------ ------------------------------
Eat the &quot;food&quot; at O'Malley's   Eat the &quot;food&quot; at O'Malley's
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Numeric constants===

Numeric constants can take the form of:

* plain integers &amp;ndash; &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt;
* decimal numbers &amp;ndash; &lt;code&gt;123.45&lt;/code&gt;
* decimal numbers in scientific notation &amp;ndash; &lt;code&gt;123.45E5&lt;/code&gt; (equates to 12,345,000)

Numeric constants cannot have commas, dollar signs or other non-numeric characters other than the decimal point or the E in scientific notation.

===Date/time constants===

Date and time constants are best written as hash-delimited strings, either in long textual format, US date format (&lt;code&gt;mm/dd/yyyy&lt;/code&gt;) or in ODBC date format (&lt;code&gt;yyyy-mm-dd&lt;/code&gt;).

&lt;!-- NB: don't use syntax highlighting on this fragment, as JET != SQL --&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Select #26 October 2007 6:43pm# As D_Long_Format, 
 #10/26/2007 18:43:00# As D_US_Format, 
 #2007-10-26 18:43:00# As D_ODBC_Format
go

D_Long_Format           D_US_Format             D_ODBC_Format
----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
26/10/2007 18:43:00     26/10/2007 18:43:00     26/10/2007 18:43:00
&lt;/pre&gt;

NB: JET does '''not''' unambiguously accept dates in other formats! Specifying a date in &lt;code&gt;dd/mm/yyyy&lt;/code&gt;, for example, will appear to work correctly when there is no possibility of interpreting that date in US date format, otherwise it will be interpreted incorrectly, ''no matter what regional settings are in use''. To remove ambiguity, it is best to specify dates in ODBC format.

==Reserved words==

This is a list of the reserved words in JET. Not all of these words will cause problems when used as object names, as at JET 4.0, but may in a future version of JET.

{{miskito_note|Although the above definition is true of most uses of ligatures, it is also possible for a noun with ligature to be used without anything preceding it, e.g. '''bukka'''. In this case, the ligature seems to make the phrase more definite: '''bukka ba''' ''the book'' (also '''buk ba''').}}

&lt;br&gt;

==Rules for adding '''-ka'''==
{{miskito_model|
* '''Miskitu''' kum kum Inglis bila aisisa, kuna naha '''Miskituka''' nani Inglis bila nu apia sa.
* '''Yapti''' wala nani ba inska atkisa, kuna baha '''yaptika''' inska laik apia sa.
* '''Kalila''' wîna auhni pali sa, kuna witin nani naha '''kalilka''' piras kan.
* '''Tiara''' kum kum lalah briras, bara baha '''tiarka''' nani dia muni wark plikras sa ki?
* '''Waitna''' kum kaikisna. Baha '''waitnika''' lalah makabisa.
* '''Aisa''' kum utla ra balan. Yang baha '''aisika''' nu sna.
* Yabal ra '''mairin''' kum an '''tuktan''' kum bara sa. Naha '''mairka''' an naha '''tuktika''' plun makabisa.

* Some '''Miskitos''' speak English, but these '''Miskitos''' do not know English.
* The other '''mothers''' buy fish, but that '''mother''' does not like fish.
* '''Chicken''' (meat) is very tasty, but they did not eat this '''chicken'''.
* Some '''young women''' have no money, so why don't those '''young women''' look for work?
* I see a '''man'''. That '''man''' is asking for money.
* A '''father''' came to the house. I know that '''father'''.
* There is a '''woman''' and a '''child''' on the road. This '''woman''' and this '''child''' are asking for food.
