[[w:WP:SNOW|SNOW]] is used as an interpretation on Wikipedia, and is something that I believe should always be followed. Here is an example.

1. If an article is speedily deleted for a reason not explicitly listed in the criteria for speedy deletion but it would almost certainly be deleted via the article deletion process anyway, there's little sense in undeleting it.

What this basically means is if something is going to happen, don't extend the process longer than it needs to be extended. 

On wikipedia it is descirbed as 

''If an issue doesn't even have a snowball's chance in hell of getting an unexpected outcome from a certain process, then there is no need to run it through that process.''

Of course, this does not mean that you cannot fight an uphill battle, becuase that is potentially winnable. In the Wikibooks community, it is best to settle the dispute through discussion and debate. This should not be done merely to assuage complaints that process wasn't followed, but to produce a correct outcome, which often requires that the full process be followed. Allowing a process to continue to its conclusion may allow for a more reasoned discourse, ensures that all arguments are fully examined, and maintains a sense of fairness.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= WLAN =

WLAN, or ''[[w:Wireless_LAN|Wireless Local Area Network]]'' is a set of standards for creating a Local Network using radios to communicate. A Wireless LAN can be thought of like a shared segment of network cable. Instead of the network card encoding the data into electrical signals on the wire, the wireless network card uses a radio to encode the data onto radio waves which it broadcasts.

Wireless LANs share many challenges with simple shared-segment LANs, such as collisions.

==Standards==
'''IEEE 802.11''' is a set of standards for [[w:Wireless_LAN|wireless local area network]] (WLAN) computer communication, developed by the [[w:Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] LAN/MAN Standards Committee ([[w:IEEE 802|IEEE 802]]) in the 5 [[w:GHz|GHz]] and 2.4 GHz public spectrum bands. 

Although the terms 802.11 and [[w:Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi]] are often used interchangeably, the [[w:Wi-Fi Alliance|Wi-Fi Alliance]] uses the term &quot;Wi-Fi&quot; to define a slightly different set of overlapping standards. In some cases, [[w:market demand|market demand]] has led the Wi-Fi Alliance to begin certifying products before amendments to the 802.11 standard are completed.   

===General description===
[[Image:Linksys Router.png|thumb|right|200px|A [[w:Linksys|Linksys]] [[w:Residential gateway|Residential gateway]] with an 802.11b radio and a 4-port ethernet switch.]]
[[Image:Compaq WL200 802.11b PCI card.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Compaq 802.11b PCI card]]
The 802.11 family includes over-the-air [[w:modulation|modulation]] techniques that use the same basic protocol. The most popular are those defined by the 802.11b and 802.11g protocols, and are amendments to the original standard.  802.11a was the first wireless networking standard, but 802.11b was the first widely accepted one, followed by 802.11g and 802.11n. Security was originally purposefully weak  due to export requirements of some governments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbwexchange.com/wireless_internet_access/802.11g_wireless_internet_access.asp Looking for 802.11g Wireless Internet Access information, definitions and technology descriptions?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and was later enhanced via the 802.11i amendment after governmental and legislative changes. 802.11n is a new multi-streaming modulation technique that is still under draft development, but products based on its proprietary pre-draft versions are being sold.  Other standards in the family (c–f, h, j) are service amendments and extensions or corrections to previous specifications. 

802.11b and 802.11g use the 2.4 GHz [[w:ISM band|ISM band]], operating in the United States under [[w:Part 15 (FCC rules)|Part 15]] of the US Federal Communications Commission Rules and Regulations. Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b and g equipment may occasionally suffer [[w:interference|interference]] from microwave ovens and cordless telephones. [[w:Bluetooth|Bluetooth]] devices, while operating in the same band, in theory do not interfere with 802.11b/g because they use a frequency hopping [[w:spread spectrum|spread spectrum]] signaling method ([[w:Frequency-hopping spread spectrum|FHSS]]) while 802.11b/g uses a direct sequence spread spectrum signaling method ([[w:DSSS|DSSS]]). 802.11a uses the [[w:U-NII|5 GHz U-NII band]], which offers 8 non-overlapping channels rather than the 3 offered in the 2.4GHz ISM frequency band.

The segment of the radio frequency spectrum used varies between countries. In the US, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as explained in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.  Frequencies used by channels one through six (802.11b) fall within the 2.4 GHz amateur radio band.  Licensed amateur radio operators may operate 802.11b/g devices under [[w:Part 97 (FCC rules)|Part 97]] of the FCC Rules and Regulations, allowing increased power output but not commercial content or encryption.&lt;ref name=&quot;part97&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ARRLWeb: Part 97 - Amateur Radio Service|publisher=American Radio Relay League|url =http://www.arrl.org/FandES/field/regulations/news/part97/|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protocols ===
==== Summary ====
Wireless networking standards define the essential elements of wireless protocols. The define how data is encoded, collision avoidance, frequencies, and so forth.

==== 802.11-1997 (802.11 legacy) ====
See Also [[w:IEEE 802.11 (legacy mode)|IEEE 802.11 (legacy mode) on Wikipedia]]

The original version of the standard IEEE 802.11, released in 1997 and clarified in 1999, specified two raw [[w:Data signaling rate|data rate]]s of 1 and 2 megabits per second (Mbit/s) to be transmitted in [[w:ISM band|Industrial Scientific Medical frequency band]] at 2.4 GHz.

Legacy 802.11 was rapidly supplemented (and popularized) by 802.11b.

The 802.11a standard uses the same core protocol as the original standard, operates in 5 GHz band with a maximum raw data rate of 54 Mbit/s, which yields realistic net achievable throughput in the mid-20 Mbit/s.

Since the 2.4 GHz band is heavily used to the point of being crowded, using the relatively un-used 5 GHz band gives 802.11a a significant advantage. However, this high carrier frequency also brings a slight disadvantage: The effective overall range of 802.11a is slightly less than that of 802.11b/g; 802.11a signals cannot penetrate as far as those for 802.11b because they are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path.

See Also [[w:IEEE 802.11b-1999|IEEE 802.11b-1999 on Wikipedia]]

802.11b has a maximum raw data rate of 11 Mbit/s and uses the same media access method defined in the original standard. 802.11b products appeared on the market in early 2000, since 802.11b is a direct extension of the modulation technique defined in the original standard.  The dramatic increase in throughput of 802.11b (compared to the original standard) along with simultaneous substantial price reductions led to the rapid acceptance of 802.11b as the definitive wireless LAN technology.

802.11b devices suffer interference from other products operating in the 2.4 GHz band. Devices operating in the 2.4 GHz range include: microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors and cordless telephones.

See Also [[w:IEEE 802.11g-2003|IEEE 802.11g-2003 on Wikipedia]]

In June 2003, a third modulation standard was ratified: 802.11g. This works in the 2.4 GHz band (like 802.11b) but operates at a maximum raw data rate of 54 Mbit/s, or about 19 Mbit/s net throughput. 802.11g hardware is fully backwards compatible with 802.11b hardware. 

The then-proposed 802.11g standard was rapidly adopted by consumers starting in January 2003, well before ratification, due to the desire for higher speeds, and reductions in manufacturing costs. By summer 2003, most dual-band 802.11a/b products became dual-band/tri-mode, supporting a and b/g in a single mobile [[w:adapter card|adapter card]] or access point.  Details of making b and g work well together occupied much of the lingering technical process; in an 802.11g network, however, activity by a 802.11b participant will reduce the speed of the overall 802.11g network.

Like 802.11b, 802.11g devices suffer interference from other products operating in the 2.4 GHz band. Devices operating in the 2.4 GHz range include: microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors and cordless telephones.

==== 802.11-2007 ====
In 2003, task group TGma was authorized to &quot;roll up&quot; many of the amendments to the 1999 version of the 802.11 standard. REVma or 802.11ma, as it was called, created a single document that merged 8 amendments ([[w:IEEE 802.11a|802.11a]],[[w:IEEE 802.11b|b]],[[w:IEEE 802.11d|d]],[[w:IEEE 802.11e|e]],[[w:IEEE 802.11g|g]],[[w:IEEE 802.11h|h]],[[w:IEEE 802.11i|i]],[[w:IEEE 802.11j|j]]) with the base standard. Upon approval on March 08 2007, 802.11REVma was renamed to the current standard '''IEEE 802.11-2007'''.&lt;ref name=802.11-2007&gt;{{cite book |title=IEEE |id=ISBN 0-7381-5656-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the single most modern 802.11 document available that contains cumulative changes from multiple sub-letter task groups.

802.11n is a proposed amendment which improves upon the previous 802.11 standards by adding [[w:multiple-input multiple-output|multiple-input multiple-output]] (MIMO) and many other newer features.  Though there are already many products on the market based on Draft 2.0 of this proposal, the TGn workgroup is not expected to finalize the amendment until November 2008.&lt;ref name=80211timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Reports/802.11_Timelines.htm |accessdate=2007-11-18 |date=[[2007-11-15]] |title=Official IEEE 802.11 working group project timelines }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Channels and international compatibility ===
See also [[w:Wi-Fi Technical Information|Wi-Fi Technical Information]]

802.11 divides each of the above-described bands into channels, analogously to how radio and TV broadcast bands are carved up but with greater channel width and overlap.  For example the 2.4000-2.4835 GHz band is divided into 13 channels each of width 22 MHz but spaced only 5 MHz apart, with channel 1 centered on 2412 MHz and 13 on 2472, to which Japan adds a 14th channel 12 MHz above channel 13.

Availability of channels is regulated by country, constrained in part by how each country [[w:Frequency allocation|allocates radio spectrum]] to various services.  At one extreme Japan permits the use of all 14 channels (with the exclusion of 802.11g/n from channel 14), while at the other Spain allowed only channels 10 and 11 (later all of the 14 channels have been allowed&lt;ref name=&quot;CNAF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Cuadro nacional de Atribución de Frecuencias CNAF|publisher=Secretaría de Estado de Telecomunicaciones|url =http://www.mityc.es/Telecomunicaciones/Secciones/Espectro/cnaf|accessdate=2008-03-05|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
), to which France adds 12 and 13.  Most other European countries are almost as liberal as Japan, disallowing only channel 14, while North America and some Central and South American countries further disallow 12 and 13.  ''For more details on this topic, see [[w:List of WLAN channels|Wikipedia's List of WLAN channels]].''

Besides specifying the center frequency of each channel, 802.11 also specifies (in Clause 17) a [[w:spectral mask|spectral mask]] defining the permitted distribution of power across each channel.  The mask requires that the signal be [[w:Attenuation|attenuated]] by at least 30 [[w:decibel|dB]] from its peak energy at ± 11 MHz from the center frequency, the sense in which channels are effectively 22 MHz wide.  One consequence is that stations can only use every fourth or fifth channel without overlap, typically 1, 6 and 11 in the Americas, 1-13 in Europe, etc.  Another is that channels 1-13 effectively require the band 2401-2483 MHz, the actual allocations being for example 2400-2483.5 in the UK, 2402-2483.5 in the US, etc.

Since the spectral mask only defines power output restrictions up to ± 22 MHz from the center frequency to be attenuated by 50 dB, it is often assumed that the energy of the channel extends no further than these limits. It is more correct to say that, given the separation between channels 1, 6, and 11, the signal on any channel should be sufficiently attenuated to minimally interfere with a transmitter on any other channel. Due to the [[w:near-far problem|near-far problem]] a transmitter can impact a receiver on a &quot;non-overlapping&quot; channel, but only if it is close to the victim receiver (within a meter) or operating above allowed power levels.

Although the statement that channels 1, 6, and 11 are &quot;non-overlapping&quot; is limited to spacing or product density, the 1–6–11 guideline has merit. If transmitters are closer together than channels 1, 6, and 11 (for example, 1, 4, 7, and 10), overlap between the channels may cause unacceptable degradation of signal quality and throughput.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciscodeployissues&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Channel Deployment Issues for 2.4 GHz 802.11 WLANs|publisher=Cisco Systems, Inc|url =http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/wireless/ps430/prod_technical_reference09186a00802846a2.html|accessdate=2007-02-07|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no standard or task group named &quot;802.11x&quot;.  Rather, this term is used informally to denote any current or future 802.11 amendment, in cases where further precision is not necessary.  (The [[IEEE 802.1x]] standard for port-based network access control is often mistakenly called &quot;802.11x&quot; when used in the context of wireless networks.)

802.11F and 802.11T are recommended practices rather than standards, and are capitalized as such.

==== Standard or amendment? ====

Both the terms &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;amendment&quot; are used when referring to the different variants of '''IEEE 802.11'''.

As far as the IEEE Standards Association is concerned, there is only one current standard, it is denoted by- '''IEEE 802.11''' followed by the date that it was published. IEEE 802.11-2007 is the only version currently in publication. The standard is updated by means of amendments. Amendments are created by task groups (TG). Both the task group and their finished document are denoted by 802.11 followed by a non-capitalized letter. For example [[IEEE 802.11a]] and [[IEEE 802.11b]]. Updating 802.11 is the responsibility of task group m. In order to create a new version, TGm combines the previous version of the standard and all published amendments. TGm also provides clarification and interpretation to industry on published documents. New versions of the '''IEEE 802.11''' were published in 1999 and 2007.

The working title of 802.11-2007 was 802.11-REVma. This denotes a third type of document, a &quot;revision&quot;. The complexity of combining 802.11-1999 with 8 amendments made it necessary to revise already agreed upon text. As a result, additional guidelines associated with a revision had to be followed.

=== Nomenclature ===

Various terms in 802.11 are used to specify aspects of wireless local-area networking operation, and may be unfamiliar to some readers.

For example, [[TU (Time Unit)|Time Unit]] (usually abbreviated TU) is used to indicate a unit of time equal to 1024 microseconds. Numerous time constants are defined in terms of TU (rather than the nearly-equal millisecond).

Also the term &quot;Portal&quot; is used to describe an entity that is similar to an [[IEEE 802.1D]] bridge. A Portal provides access to the WLAN by non-802.11 LAN STAs.

=== Community networks ===

With the proliferation of cable modems and DSL, there is an ever-increasing market of people who wish to establish small networks in their homes to share their high speed Internet connection.

Many hotspot or free networks frequently allow anyone within range, including passersby outside, to connect to the Internet. There are also efforts by volunteer groups to establish wireless community networks to provide free wireless connectivity to the public.

=== Non-standard 802.11 extensions and equipment ===
Many companies implement wireless networking equipment with non-IEEE standard 802.11 extensions either by implementing proprietary or draft features.  These changes may lead to incompatibilities between these extensions.

== Wireless Security ==

There are three formal standards for securing a wireless network from unwanted access and use:

* [[w:Wired_Equivalent_Privacy|Wired equivalent privacy]]/WEP
* [[w:Wi-Fi_Protected_Access|Wi-Fi Protected Access]]/WPA — Newer and much safer
* [[w:IEEE_802.11i-2004|IEEE 802.11i-2004]]/WPA2/WPA2-PSK — The latest and most secure of the three

All equipment will state on the packaging which standard(s) it supports. Most modern equipment will support all three.

In 2001, a group from the University of California, Berkeley presented a paper describing weaknesses in the [[w:802.11|802.11]] [[w:Wired Equivalent Privacy|Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) security mechanism defined in the original standard; they were followed by [[w:Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir attack|Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir's paper]] entitled &quot;Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of [[w:RC4|RC4]]&quot;.  Not long after, Adam Stubblefield and [[w:AT&amp;T|AT&amp;T]] publicly announced the first verification of the attack. In the attack they were able to intercept transmissions and gain unauthorized access to wireless networks. Equipment supporting only WEP should be avoided as that standard has been fatally compromised and can be defeated with minimal effort by an attacker (with the right tools, this can be done in 2 minutes).

The IEEE set up a dedicated task group to create a replacement security solution, 802.11i (previously this work was handled as part of a broader 802.11e effort to enhance the [[w:Media Access Control|MAC]] layer). The [[w:Wi-Fi Alliance|Wi-Fi Alliance]] announced an interim specification called [[w:Wi-Fi Protected Access|Wi-Fi Protected Access]] ([[w:Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]]) based on a subset of the then current IEEE 802.11i draft.  These started to appear in products in mid-2003. [[w:IEEE 802.11i|IEEE 802.11i]] (also known as [[w:WPA2|WPA2]]) itself was ratified in June 2004, and uses government strength encryption in the [[w:Advanced Encryption Standard|Advanced Encryption Standard]] AES, instead of [[w:RC4|RC4]], which was used in WEP. The modern recommended encryption for the home/consumer space is WPA2 (AES PreShared Key) and for the Enterprise space is WPA2 along with a [[w:radius server|radius server]] the strongest is [[w:EAP-TLS|EAP-TLS]]. 

In January 2005, IEEE set up yet another task group TGw to protect management and broadcast frames, which previously were sent unsecured.  See [[w:IEEE 802.11w|IEEE 802.11w]]

'''''Euphorbia maculata''''' (creeping spurge) is a mat-forming native annual weed common throughout the region. It grows on any exposed soils, in sunny or partially shaded locations. The leaves are opposite, usually with a purple center on the upper side, on reddish stems. 

The tiny white flowers are quickly followed by very small seeds which are easily moved on shoes, tools, etc. 

Remove by pulling, or by hoeing followed by mulch. Plants should not be disposed of in cold composting systems, since they produce copious seed.

The stems of this plant contain a milky sap that can cause skin irritation in susceptible people.

{| cellpadding=&quot;15&quot;
 | valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;|'''''Phytolacca americana''''' (pokeweed) is a shrub-like native herbaceous perennial with green or reddish stems, large leaves, and a long, fleshy taproot. The plant's seeds are berries that are spread by birds, and frequently are found around the driplines of trees, shrubs, and along fencerows. 

Pokeweed can be difficult to pull due to the very heavy and deep taproots, and a full-sized mattock may be required for large specimens. Seed supplies can be reduced by at least cutting down plants in adjacent uncultivated areas before the berries ripen. Seeds may germinate under mulch, and paper barriers are ineffective as the plant can push through.

Pokeweed shoots can be composted in cold piles if berries are not present (roots should not be added to cold piles).

The trick with weedy grasses lies in being able to identify them in contrast to desirable plants which may have grass-like leaves.

Unfortunately, at present Question Writer 3 does not support '''right to left''' text. 

Even if a right to left ISO embedded font is used, any right to left text that is entered will be flipped over when the quiz is viewed.

It is possible, if you have time and determination, to input your right to left text with all words and letters in reverse order.  

The example given below shows part of the front page of the Italian quiz sample with arabic script.  The resulting quiz shows the script characters in their standalone form, which makes reading much slower.  If you attempt this workaround, you will also have to make sure that you do not use any question types which require a written answer (fill in the blank or essay types).

      <comment>Make a distinction between filesystem and netdevice namespace, and get interface/device/driver notation right</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In many Unix operating systems the network devices have appearances in both the filesystem namespace (e.g. the &lt;tt&gt;/dev&lt;/tt&gt; directory) and the network interface namespace. This is not so in Linux, where no character devices are used.

In the majority of cases, the network interface is automatically created by the device driver while it is initializing after it has located your hardware. For example, the ethernet device driver creates eth[0..n] interfaces sequentially as drivers locate your ethernet hardware. The first ethernet card found becomes eth0, the second eth1, etc.

In some cases though, notably slip and ppp, the network devices are created through the action of some user program. The same sequential device numbering applies, but the devices are not created automatically at boot time. The reason for this is that, unlike ethernet devices, the number of active slip or ppp devices may vary during the uptime of the machine. These cases will be covered in more detail in later sections.

      <comment>iproute2</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">When you have all of the programs, you need and your address and network information you can configure your network interfaces. When we talk about configuring a network interface, we are talking about the process of assigning appropriate addresses to a network device and to setting appropriate values for other configurable parameters of a network device. The program most commonly used to do this is the ''ip'' command.

Typically you would use a command similar to the following:

 ip addr add 192.168.0.1/24 dev eth0
 ip link set eth0 up

In this case, I am configuring an ethernet interface &quot;eth0&quot; with the IP address 192.168.0.1 and a [[Wikipedia:CIDR|prefix length]] of 24 to specify the network size. The second command tells the operating system that it should set the interface active, but can usually be omitted, as it is the default. To shutdown an interface, you can just call `&lt;code&gt;ip link set eth0 down&lt;/code&gt;`.

iproute2 assumes certain defaults when configuring interfaces. For example, if you do not specify a prefix length, it will use /32.

There are many other options to the ''ip link'' command. The most
important of these are:

   up
      this option activates an interface (and is the default).

   down
      this option deactivates an interface.

   arp on/off
      this option enables or disables use of the address resolution
      protocol on this interface

   allmulticast on/off
      this option enables or disables the reception of all hardware
      multicast packets. Hardware multicast enables groups of hosts to
      receive packets addressed to special destinations. This may be
      of importance if you are using applications like desktop

   mtu N
      this parameter allows you to set the MTU of this device.

   addr &lt;addr&gt;
      this parameter allows you to set the hardware address of certain
      types of network devices. This is not often useful for ethernet,
      but is useful for other network types such as AX.25.

For ''ip addr'', one can specify

   (ip addr add ...) brd addr
      this parameter allows you to enable and set the accepting of
      datagrams destined to the IPv4 broadcast address, or to disable
      reception of these datagrams. One can use `brd +` to automatically
      fill in the broadcast address.

You may use the ip command on any network interface. Some user programs such as pppd and dip automatically configure the network devices as they create them, so manual use of ifconfig is unnecessary.

      <comment>moved [[Linux Networking/Configuring your Name Resolver.]] to [[Linux Networking/Configuring your Name Resolver]]: Remove period</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The `Name Resolver' is a part of the linux standard library. Its prime function is to provide a service to convert human-friendly hostnames like `ftp.funet.fi' into machine friendly IP addresses such as 128.214.248.6.

== What's in a name ? == 

You will probably be familiar with the appearance of Internet host names, but may not understand how they are constructed, or deconstructed. Internet domain names are hierarchical in nature, that is, they have a tree-like structure. A `domain' is a family, or group of names. A `domain' may be broken down into `subdomain'. A `toplevel domain' is a domain that is not a subdomain. The Top Level Domains are specified in RFC-920. Some examples of the most common top level domains are:

   COM
      Commercial Organizations

   EDU
      Educational Organizations

   GOV
      Government Organizations

   MIL
      Military Organizations

   ORG
      Other organizations

   NET
      Internet-Related Organizations

   Country Designator
      these are two letters codes that represent a particular country.

For historical reasons most domains belonging to one of the non- country based top level domains were used by organizations within the United States, although the United States also has its own country code `.us'. This is not true any more for .com and .org domains, which are commonly used by non-us companies.  

Each of these top level domains has subdomains. The top level domains based on country name are often next broken down into subdomains based on the com, edu, gov, mil and org domains. So for example you end up with: com.au and gov.au for commercial and government organizations in Australia; note that this is not a general rule, as actual policies depend on the naming authority for each domain.


The next level of division usually represents the name of the organization.  Further subdomains vary in nature, often the next level of subdomain is based on the departmental structure of the organization but it may be based on any criterion considered reasonable and meaningful by the network administrators for the organization.

The very left-most portion of the name is always the unique name assigned to the host machine and is called the `hostname', the portion of the name to the right of the hostname is called the `domainname' and the complete name is called the `Fully Qualified Domain Name'. 
 
To use Terry's host as an example, the fully qualified domain name is `perf.no.itg.telstra.com.au'. This means that the host name is `perf' and the domain name is `no.itg.telstra.com.au'. The domain name is based on a top level domain based on his country, Australia and as his email address belongs to a commercial organization, `.com' is there as the next level domain. The name of the company is (was) `telstra' and their internal naming structure is based on organizational structure, in this case the machine belongs to the Information Technology Group, Network Operations section.

Usually, the names are fairly shorter; for example, my ISP is called ``systemy.it'' and my non-profit organization is called ``linux.it'', without any com and org subdomain, so that my own host is just called ``morgana.systemy.it'' and rubini@linux.it is a valid email address.  Note that the owner of a domain has the rights to register hostnames as well as subdomains; for example, the LUG I belong to uses the domain pluto.linux.it, because the owners of linux.it agreed to open a
subdomain for the LUG.

== What information you will need. ==

You will need to know what domain your hosts name will belong to. The name resolver software provides this name translation service by making requests to a `Domain Name Server', so you will need to know the IP address of a local nameserver that you can use.

There are three files you need to edit, I'll cover each of these in turn.

== /etc/resolv.conf == 

The /etc/resolv.conf is the main configuration file for the name resolver code. Its format is quite simple. It is a text file with one keyword per line. There are three keywords typically used, they are: 

   domain
      this keyword specifies the local domain name.

   search
      this keyword specifies a list of alternate domain names to
      search for a hostname

   nameserver
      this keyword, which may be used many times, specifies an IP
      address of a domain name server to query when resolving names


An example /etc/resolv.conf might look something like:



             domain maths.wu.edu.au
             search maths.wu.edu.au wu.edu.au
             nameserver 192.168.10.1
             nameserver 192.168.12.1


This example specifies that the default domain name to append to unqualified names (ie hostnames supplied without a domain) is maths.wu.edu.au and that if the host is not found in that domain to also try the wu.edu.au domain directly. Two nameservers entry are supplied, each of which may be called upon by the name resolver code to resolve the name.

== /etc/host.conf ==

The /etc/host.conf file is where you configure some items that govern the behaviour of the name resolver code. The format of this file is described in detail in the `resolv+' man page. In nearly all circumstances the following example will work for you: 


             order hosts,bind
             multi on



This configuration tells the name resolver to check the /etc/hosts file before attempting to query a nameserver and to return all valid addresses for a host found in the /etc/hosts file instead of just the first.

== /etc/hosts ==

The /etc/hosts file is where you put the name and IP address of local hosts. If you place a host in this file then you do not need to query the domain name server to get its IP Address. The disadvantage of doing this is that you must keep this file up to date yourself if the IP address for that host changes. In a well managed system the only hostnames that usually appear in this file are an entry for the loopback interface and the local hosts name.


             # /etc/hosts
             127.0.0.1      localhost loopback
             192.168.0.1    this.host.name



You may specify more than one host name per line as demonstrated by the first entry, which is a standard entry for the loopback interface.

== Running a name server == 

If you want to run a local nameserver, you can do it easily. Please refer to the DNS-HOWTO and to any documents included in your version of BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain).

== [[GRE]] ==

I added a merge suggestion that [[GRE Preparation Guide]] should be merged with [[GRE]]. I worked on the later for a while, but am sadly no longer able to maintain it actively. Take a look at [[GRE]], and see what it's current status is, and what value it contains that you might find useful. Let me know if you think a merge is appropriate (we can do it on your terms) or if you think the two books are different enough that they can stay separate? I'll help you with this in any way that you need. Thanks. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:21, 22 September 2008 (UTC)

:Don't worry about delays in responses, we're all volunteers here and nobody is on a strict timeline. The [[GRE]] book I started back when I was studying for that test. If it's not helpful to you in any way, don't worry about it. Keeping two books on the same subject isn't a bad thing. Let me know if you need any help. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:50, 30 September 2008 (UTC)

I've added a {{tlx|query}} tag to [[GRE/GRE Aspirations with a 3 year Degree]] because it seems not to be textbook material. If you're going to fix it up, just remove the template and do so. In seven days it'll become a candidate for [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deletion]]. If you would like help to spruce it up, just ask. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:44, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In grammar the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative comparative] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superlative superlative] of an adjective or adverb is a form of adjective or adverb which indicates that something has some feature to a greater degree than anything it is being compared to in a given context. For example, if Adam is 45, Bess is 35, and Chris is 25, Bess is '''older''' than Chris but Adam is the '''oldest''' of the three, because his age transcends those of Bess and Chris in one direction, while Chris is the '''youngest''', because his age transcends those of Adam and Bess in the other direction. If Dan, who is 50, and Edna, who is 20, join the group, Dan now becomes the oldest and Edna the youngest.


== Rules ==

In [[Polish]] the construction of the comparative and superlative depends on the form of the word.

# For words ending on '''k''', e.g. szero'''k'''i, wyso'''k'''i or szyb'''k'''i, the comparative is constructed by removing the ending of the word and adding '''szy''', e.g. szer'''szy''', wyż'''szy''' and szyb'''szy'''. The superlative is constructed by adding '''naj''' in front of the comparative, e.g. '''naj'''szerszy, '''naj'''wyższy, '''naj'''szybszy'''.
# For words not ending on '''k''', e.g. stary, nowy and tani the comparative case is constructed by adding the '''szy''' directly on the end of the word, e.g. star'''szy''', now'''szy''', tań'''szy'''. The superlative is constructed in the same way as above, by adding a '''naj''' in front, e.g. '''naj'''starszy, '''naj'''nowszy, '''naj'''tańszy.
# Words ending '''n''' or '''pł''' construct the comparative and superlative the same way as above, except they need a '''niej''' between the ending of the word and the '''szy'''. So they become ład'''niejszy''', wygod'''niejszy''', ciep'''lejszy''' in the comparative case and '''naj'''ład'''niejszy''', '''naj'''wygod'''niejszy''', '''naj'''ciep'''lejszy''' in the superlative case. Note that the '''ł''' changes to '''l''' in &quot;ciepły&quot;.
# There are some irregular cases, see the examples below
# Finally, there are the adjectives which doesn't have comparative and superlative. An example in English is ''awful'', which becomes ''more awful'' and ''most awful''. In Polish the words '''bardziej''' and '''najbardziej''' are used for ''more''/''most'' and '''mniej'''/'''najmniej''' are used for ''less''/''least''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am currently a resident of Allen, Texas located in Collin County just north of Dallas off I-75. I am originally from West Texas having lived most of my life in the city of my birth, Abilene.

I am a graduate of Cooper High School in Abilene, Cisco Junior College, A.S., Hardin Simmons University, B.S., Tarleton State University, M.S., and West Texas A&amp;M. University, M.Ed. I am currently a student at Midwestern State University working on what is missing from my resume, a M.A. I am often asked why not a PhD., and my answer is that seems so final and limiting, I love studying different things, though whatever I take up usually involves computers in some way.

I am extremely interested in learning all I can about Second Life!</text>

== Perfective vs Imperfective ==

Each Polish verb is either '''perfective'''  or '''imperfective'''. Basically, perfective verbs imply completion, while imperfective verbs imply an ongoing action with no sense of completion. 

Perfective verbs are sometimes created by adding a prefix (do-, na-, od-, po-, prze-, przy-, s-, u-, wy-, z-, za-) to an imperfective verb, but not always - the prefix might also change the meaning slightly (e.g., &quot;pisać&quot; means &quot;to write&quot; and &quot;napisać&quot; - &quot;to have written&quot;, but &quot;przepisać&quot; means &quot;to rewrite&quot; or &quot;to copy the writing&quot;)

== Example: ''czytać'' ==
The verb ''czytać'' has a very typical conjugation. Many (but not all) verbs ending in '''-ać''' conjugate in this way.

'''czytać''', meaning &quot;to read&quot;, is an '''imperfective''' verb. For now we only look at the '''present tense''':

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 1st person
| align=&quot;center&quot; | ja 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | czyta'''m'''
| align=&quot;left&quot; | I am reading /I read
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 2nd person
| align=&quot;center&quot; | ty 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | czyta'''sz'''
| align=&quot;left&quot; | You (singular) are reading /You read
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 3rd person
| align=&quot;center&quot; | on / ona / ono 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | czyta
| align=&quot;left&quot; | He/she/it is reading /He/she/it reads
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 1st person, plural
| align=&quot;center&quot; | my 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | czyta'''my'''
| align=&quot;left&quot; | We are reading /We read
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 2nd person, plural
| align=&quot;center&quot; | wy 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | czyta'''cie'''
| align=&quot;left&quot; | You (plural) are reading /You read
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 3rd person, plural
| align=&quot;center&quot; | oni / one 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | czyta'''ją'''
| align=&quot;left&quot; | They are reading /They read
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;

In modern Polish there is no grammatical difference between &quot;W tej chwili czytam książkę.&quot; - I am reading a book right now - and &quot;Codziennie czytam gazetę&quot; - I read (the) paper every day.

&lt;br&gt;

'''Przeczytać''' means &quot;to have read&quot;. Polish does have an equivalent of present perfect, but it will probably seem a bit unclear to an English speaker. Don't worry, there is a hidden logic to it. Remember that perfective verbs imply '''completion''' so ''Przeczytam książkę'' means &quot;I will read the book (and finish).&quot; In other words, &quot;I will have read the entire book (in the future).&quot;

Note that, like in Spanish and Italian, subject pronouns (ja, ty, on, my, wy, oni) are usually omitted, because they are redundant. 

Ok, let's try conjugating this verb (Click &quot;▼&quot; to check your answer):

{{Question-answer
| question = '''I''' will have read (the entire book)
| answer = Przeczytam
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = To one person: You will have read (the entire book)
| answer = Przeczytasz
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = She/he will have read (the entire book)
| answer = Przeczyta
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = We will have read (the entire book)
| answer = Przeczytamy
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = To a group of people: You will have read (the entire book)
| answer = Przeczytacie
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = They will have read (the entire book)
| answer = Przeczytają
}}

&lt;br&gt;

== kupować ==
Other '''ować''' verbs will follow this pattern.
 
'''kupować''' (to buy) is an '''imperfective''' verb,  

This is how you conjugate it:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Subject
! Pronoun
! Conjugated verb 
! Translation   
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 1st person 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Ja 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | kup'''uję'''
| align=&quot;left&quot; | I am buying /I buy
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 2nd person 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Ty 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | kup'''ujesz'''
| align=&quot;left&quot; | You (singular) are buying /You buy
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 3rd person
| align=&quot;center&quot; | On / Ona / Ono
| align=&quot;center&quot; | kup'''uje'''
| align=&quot;left&quot; | He/she/it is buying /He/she/it buys
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 1st person, plural 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | My
| align=&quot;center&quot; | kup'''ujemy'''
| align=&quot;left&quot; | We are buying /We buy
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 2nd person, plural 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Wy
| align=&quot;center&quot; | kup'''ujecie'''
| align=&quot;left&quot; | You (plural) are buying /You buy
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 3rd person, plural
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Oni / One
| align=&quot;center&quot; | kup'''ują'''
| align=&quot;left&quot; | They are buying /They buy
|-
|}

As you can see, it's quite regular.

&lt;br&gt;

Let's try conjugating a verb of this same type. However, our chosen verb '''narysować (to have drawn a picture)''' happens to be a '''perfective''' verb, therefore, when you conjugate it, you get the future tense.

Ok, let's start conjugating. 
{{Question-answer
| question = I will have drawn
| answer = Ja narysuję
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = To one person: You will have drawn
| answer = Narysujesz
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = He will have drawn
| answer = On narysuje
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = We will have drawn
| answer = Narysujemy
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = To a group of people: You will have drawn
| answer = Narysujecie
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = They will have drawn
| answer = Narysują
}}

= Introduction to declension =

Polish has seven [[w:Grammatical case|cases]]. Here's the basic idea - you should be familiar with it if you studied Latin at school:

*The '''[[w:Nominative case|nominative case]]''' (lat. nominativus, pl. mianownik) - this is the &quot;basic&quot; form of a noun you'll find in the dictionary. In a sentence it serves as the subject:
*:'''''The man''' went to the store.''

*The '''[[w:Genitive case|genitive case]]''' (lat. genetivus, pl. dopełniacz) - this is the possessive case (in English you just add ''''s'''. Believe me or not, the ''''s''' is the vestige of more complicated declension English used to have). Besides, the genitive is used for the '''direct object in negative sentences''':
*: '''''A country's''' citizens must defend its honour.''
*: ''I did not buy '''the car'''.''

*The '''[[w:Dative case|dative case]]''' (lat. dativus, pl. celownik) indicates the '''indirect object''' of a verb ('''To whom?''' or '''For whom?'''):
*:''We told '''her''' the truth.'' 
*:''The man gave '''his daughter''' a book.''
*:''I made '''them''' dinner.''

*The '''[[w:Accusative case|accusative case]]''' (lat. accusativus, pl. biernik) - in sentences, noun in accusative is the '''direct object''' of an action:
*:''I bought '''the car'''.''

*The '''[[w:Instrumental case|instrumental case]]''' (lat. instrumentalis, pl. narzędnik) tells us with which? or how? an action is performed:
*:''He shot it with '''the gun'''.''

*The '''[[w:Locative case|locative case]]''' (in Latin this case merged with ablativus, pl. miejscownik) indicates a '''location''' of something/someone:
*:''I live in '''China'''.''

*The '''[[w:Vocative case|vocative case]]''' (lat. vocativus, pl. wołacz) is for directly addressing a person:
*:'''''Professor''', are you O.K.?''

Hi everybody,

I am having problems with finding images of the Manchu characters and with the software I have to type Manchu. If anybody has say a PDF file of the letters of the Manchu alphabet it would be great if they could upload it and finish this page, or just upload it and leave a message here. If somebody has the complete 12 characters tables that would be useful as well, especially the first one.

[[wikt:子|子]][[wikt:曰|曰]]：「[[wikt:學|學]][[wikt:而|而]][[wikt:時|時]][[wikt:習|習]][[wikt:之|之]]　[[wikt:不|不]][[wikt:亦|亦]][[wikt:說|說]][[wikt:乎|乎]]　[[wikt:有|有]][[wikt:朋|朋]][[wikt:自|自]][[wikt:遠|遠]][[wikt:方|方]][[wikt:來|來]]　[[wikt:不|不]][[wikt:亦|亦]][[wikt:樂|樂]][[wikt:乎|乎]]　[[wikt:人|人]][[wikt:不|不]][[wikt:知|知]][[wikt:而|而]][[wikt:不|不]][[wikt:慍|慍]]　[[wikt:不|不]][[wikt:亦|亦]][[wikt:君|君]][[wikt:子|子]][[wikt:乎|乎]]」

==Explanation==
* [[wikt:子|子]][[wikt:曰|曰]]: &quot;The master says&quot; or &quot;The master said&quot;.

Other similar uses include [[wikt:孟|孟]][[wikt:子|子]] (mèng zǐ) for Mencius and [[wikt:孫|孫]][[wikt:子|子]] (sūn zǐ) for Sun Tzu. In this case, it is ''assumed'' by the author that the learned reader will know who spoke the following quote, so it is not necessary to give the exact identity of the speaker.
** [[wikt:曰|曰]]: (yue1) ''verb'' to say. 曰 is one of the frequently used words for the verb &quot;to say&quot; in Classical Chinese. However, 曰 is not the only frequently used word for &quot;say&quot;.

** [[wikt:說|說]]: (yuè) ''adj.'' pleasant. This is a ''tongjia'' (interchangeable character)or an original form for [[wikt:悅|悅]].
** [[wikt:乎|乎]]: (hū) (question marker)
* [[wikt:有|有]][[wikt:朋|朋]][[wikt:自|自]][[wikt:遠|遠]][[wikt:方|方]][[wikt:來|來]]: Friends have come from distant places. ''(Or: ''A friend has come from a distant place.'')''

** [[wikt:而|而]]: (ér) but
** [[wikt:不|不]]: (bú) not

== Grammar ==
This grammar sections reveals that Classical Chinese in many aspects is close to English:
* The subject precedes the verb: [[wikt:朋|朋]][[wikt:來|來]] (''péng lái'') 'friend(s) come'
* The object comes after the verb: [[wikt:習|習]][[wikt:之|之]] (''xí zhī'') 'practice it'
* Adjectives used attributively precede nouns: [[wikt:遠|遠]][[wikt:方|方]]: (''yuǎn fāng'') distant place


However, there are notable differences:
* Chinese does not inflect for tense or number. In this example,
** [[wikt:子|子]][[wikt:曰|曰]] has no explicit tense: it could be 'Confucius says' or 'Confucius said'
** [[wikt:有|有]][[wikt:朋|朋]][[wikt:自|自]][[wikt:遠|遠]][[wikt:方|方]][[wikt:來|來]] has no explicit number: it could be 'Friends have come from distant places' or 'A friend has come from a distant place'
* Questions are formed by adding a marker at the end (usually it's [[wikt:乎|乎]] (''hū''), but other markers also exist)
* No linking verb is used with adjectives: [[wikt:說|說]][[wikt:乎|乎]] (''yuè hū'') 'is it pleasant?'; [[wikt:遠|遠]][[wikt:方|方]] (''yuǎn fāng'') 'distant place'
** In fact, Chinese adjectives are close to verbs ([[wikt:說|說]] (''yuè'') 'pleasant, [[wikt:遠|遠]] (''yuǎn'') 'distant'). As you'll see, adjectives and verbs share many similar features, including the fact that they both can be negated with [[wikt:不|不]] (''bù''), unlike nouns.


If you looked up words in the dictionary, you may have noticed that sometimes part of speech marked there doesn't match that in the dictionary:
* [[wikt:君|君]][[wikt:子|子]] (''jūn zǐ'') is given as the noun ('gentleman'), not as an adjective ('gentlemanly', 'like a gentleman should act')
It is because of a process called conversion: one part of speech can become another one. This process can also occur in English: &quot;I love her&quot; (a verb) versus &quot;my love&quot; (a noun).

==Grammar Notes==
English sentence of the type:
&lt;big&gt;A is B&lt;/big&gt; (A was B, etc.),
where A and B are nouns, is rendered in Classical Chinese this way:
&lt;big&gt;AB也&lt;/big&gt;

Note that [[wikt:也|也]] (yě) is a particle, not a verb like and English '''is'''. (Were it verb, it would have been placed between A and B). 

Construction «AB也» is used if A is always B in any case. So, for example, you can say «I am a man» — «吾人也», but not «I'm a minister», cause it´s something that can be taken from you.

In this case the verb 為 (wéi) is used, and it is a verb, not a particle (therefore it´s put between two nouns, line in English):
&lt;big&gt;A為B&lt;/big&gt;

For example, «吾為臣» — «I´m a minister».

Note that 為 (wéi) doesn´t change its forms like English verb does (am, is, are, be).

{| cellpadding=&quot;15&quot;
 | valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;|'''''Bidens frondosa''''' (devil's beggarticks) is an annual native plant found naturally  in low meadows but also a common weed of gardens. The plants emerge in mid spring, flowering in mid to late summer, then producing seeds that stick to clothing.

Despite being an annual, the plant can produce very tough root systems. Cold-pile composting is safe before flowers are produced.

Copy a blank version to use. Remember to use the &quot;|&quot; (pipe) character between each field.  Please delete any unused fields to avoid clutter in the edit window.

&lt;pre&gt;
{{cite paper |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= |version= |pages= |publisher= |date= 
             |url= |format= |id= |accessdate= }}

==Fields==
===Wikilinks===
Most fields can be wikilinked (i.e. ''title'' = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[book|book title]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;), but should generally only be linked to an existing Wikipedia article. Any wikilinked field '''must not''' contain any brackets apart from normal round brackets &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; don't use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&gt;[]{}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

===Description of fields===
====&lt;small&gt;Syntax (for the technical-minded)&lt;/small&gt;====
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 90%;&quot;&gt;
Nested fields either rely on their parent fields, or replace them:
*''parent''
**''child'' &amp;mdash; may be used '''with''' ''parent'' (and is ignored if ''parent'' is not used)
**OR:  ''child2'' &amp;mdash; may be used '''instead''' of ''parent'' (and is ignored if ''parent'' is used)
&lt;/div&gt;

====Description====
* '''last''': Surname of author. Don't wikilink (use ''authorlink'' instead).
** '''first''': First name(s) of author, including title(s) (e.g. ''Firstname Middlename'' or ''Firstname M.'' or ''Dr. Firstname M., Snr.''). Don't wikilink (use ''authorlink'' instead).
** '''authorlink''': Title of Wikipedia article about author. Article should already exist. Must not be wikilinked itself. Do not use this on its own, but along with &quot;author&quot; or &quot;first&quot; and &quot;last&quot;.
** '''coauthors''': Full name of additional author or authors, separated by &quot;, &quot; (e.g. ''Joe Bloggs, John F. Kennedy, H. R. Dent'').
** OR: '''author''': Full name of author, preferably surname first.
* '''title''': Title of paper. '''''This is the only required parameter.''''' Can be wikilinked '''only''' to an existing Wikipedia article. Do not use italics.
* '''version''': Version of paper, if available.
* '''pages''': First page and optional last page. This is for listing the pages relevant to the citation, not the total number of pages in the book, e.g. ''pp. 5–7''.
* '''publisher''': Publisher should not include corporate designation such as &quot;Ltd&quot; or &quot;Inc&quot;.
* '''date''': Full date of publication edition being referenced, in [[w:ISO 8601|ISO 8601]] YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. ''2006-02-17''. Must not be wikilinked.
* '''url''': URL of an online location where the book can be found. Cannot be used if you wikilinked ''title''.
** '''format''': Format, e.g. PDF. HTML implied if not specified.
* '''id''': A [[w:unique identifier|unique identifier]].  You need to specify the kind of identifier you are using, preferably with a template like {{tlx|ISSN}}.
** '''accessdate''': Full date when url was accessed, in ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. ''2006-02-17''. '''Required when ''url'' field is used.''' Must not be wikilinked.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= System of government =
About the system of government: some sources (e.g. Globe &amp; mail) give answer to this question as &quot;constitutional monarchy&quot; and not &quot;parlamentary democracy&quot;). Can someone explain?


= Most recent province =
Someone, this evening, changed the answer to the question about the most recent Candaian province.  They changed the answer from 'Prince Edward Island' to 'Nunavut'.  I'm not Canadian so therefore not 100% sure about the differences between province and territory but I suspect that Nunavut is only a territory so the answer to the question should be PE Island (which is a province).  Can someone who knows a little more than me check this and revert the edit if necessary. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:43, 8 December 2007 (UTC)
:Nunavut is indeed a territory. PEI is not the most recent addition, however - it is NL which is the youngest province; the text is correct now. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:08, 9 December 2007 (UTC)

Some sources indicate government type as &quot;constitutional monarchy&quot; while here it is &quot;parlamentary government&quot;. Which is correct?

:Parliamentary government is the correct one. (Source: A Look At Canada, 2007 Edition)

:They are both Correct. Canada is a Federal Parliamentary Democracy AND a Constitutional Monarchy.

Newfoundland is the last Province and Nunavut is the Most recent territory to join the Confederation.


= Provincial Representation =
what is right answer for 
5. What is the name of your provincial representative (member of the Legislative Assembly, member of the provincial Parliament, member of the National Assembly or member of the House of Assembly)? 

obviously not as it is, because

Gerry Sklavounos, B.C.L., LL.B., (born December 16, 1974) is a Quebec politician. He is the current Liberal Member of the National Assembly for the electoral district of Laurier-Dorion, as well as the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Health and Social Services.

&lt;big&gt;'''Randomized Evidence for Superior Vena Cava Syndrome'''&lt;/big&gt;


*'''Sao Paolo, 1999''' (Brazil) &lt;u&gt;Abstract&lt;/u&gt; &quot;Neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs radiotherapy alone for superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) due to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): preliminary results of randomized phase II trial.&quot; (Pereira JR, Eur J Cancer 1999;35(Suppl 4):260.
**Randomized. ''Terminated early due to larger number of treatment-related deaths in chemo arm.'' 34 patients with NSCLC. Treated with immediate RT + cisplatin vs. cisplatin/epirubicin/vinblastine. Info from PMID 12555872
**Outcome: no difference in relief or survival, but larger number of treatment-related deaths in chemotherapy-only arm

*'''London''' (UK)(no dates given) -- SCLC: chemo +/- RT 
**Randomized. 37/366 patients with SCLC enrolled in trial of chemotherapy +/- RT presented with SVC obstruction. 9 relapsed during chemo and were not randomized. Induction chemotherapy (adriamycin + vincristine + cyclophosphamide alternating with cyclphosphamide + MTX) x4 cycles then randomized Arm 1) RT 40/20 AP/PA vs. Arm 2) continued chemotherapy. Both consolidated with 8 cycles of chemotherapy
**'''1983''' PMID 6310812 -- &quot;Treatment of obstruction of the superior vena cava by combination chemotherapy with and without irradiation in small-cell carcinoma of the bronchus. (Spiro SG, Thorax. 1983 Jul;38(7):501-5.)
***Outcomes: After induction chemo, 21/37 (57%) CR, 10/37 (27%) PR of SVC symptoms. Median OS identical.
***Conclusion: Chemo alone effective for SVC; no benefit for consolidative RT induction chemo x4 cycles

*'''Oklahoma/Virginia''' -- high dose RT vs. nitrogen mustard + RT
**Randomized. 28 patients with SVC syndrome, 22 completed treatment. Arm 1) nitrogen mustard 0.4 mg/kg, then in 3-8 days RT 40-50 Gy in 1.5-2.0 Gy/fx vs. Arm 2) RT only (4 Gy/fx until drop in venous pressure at least 30 mm H2O or 20 Gy, then 2 Gy/fx for total 40-50 Gy), diuretics as necessary. Tumor + 1cm margin. Delivered by 2 MeV Van de Graaff unit.
**'''1969''' PMID 4898825 -- &quot;Treatment of malignant superior vena caval obstruction. A randomized study.&quot; (Levitt SH, Cancer. 1969 Sep;24(3):447-51.)
***Outcome: Time to venous pressure drop (NS), relief of symptoms (NS), duration of relief (NS), recurrence (NS), OS (NS)
***Toxicity: Combined arm more severe complications
***Conclusion: No difference between groups, suggest initially high daily dose</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey you two.  I've worked out some formatting for you and uploaded your files.  I listed them as &quot;educational fair use&quot; but you may get some questions about their origin.  Click on the pictures and it will take you to that picture's page and you should be able to work it out from there.  I hope this helps some.  I haven't had a chance to look at the embedded video.  Maybe this week sometime.~~BM

We appreciate it B. I tried the whole bracket thing until I was blue in the face! I think my biggest obstacle was that I couldn't upload any images. I kept getting an error message that I wasn't an autoconfirmed user. I will drop a note to Jess to have her update the copyright.~~LR

The pictures really add a lot to your chapter!  They were great and thanks BM for making them easily accessible.  I looked at the video, I didn't have any problems accessing it, so that was good.  When you found the video is there a date that you can place next to the website link that will allow people to know when the video itself was last updated, maintained, etc?  I know that is nit-picky so if not don't worry, just want to make sure all the works are cited.  Great job guys!~Meredith</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Naming==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... All names of things that are defined are identifiers. An identifier consists of 255 significant characters (letters, digits and the underscore character), from which the first must be an alphanumeric character, or an underscore ( _ ) ...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{cite web
  | last = Van Canneyt
  | first = Michaël
  | title = Free Pascal: Reference guide.
  | url = ftp://ftp.freepascal.org/pub/fpc/docs-pdf/ref.pdf
  | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}
&lt;!-- only spacing was changed --&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Pascal's identifiers are case-insensitive, meaning that for everything except characters and strings its case doesn't matter (&lt;code&gt;THING&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;thing&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ThInG&lt;/code&gt;, and etc are the same).


==Constants==
&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
program Useless;
const
    zilch = 0;
begin
    (*some code*)
    if zilch = zilch then
    (*more code*)
end.
&lt;/source&gt;

Constants (unlike variables) can't be changed while the program is running. This assumption allows the compiler to simply replace &lt;code&gt;zilch&lt;/code&gt; instead of wasting time to analyze it or wasting memory. As you may expect, constants must be definable at compile-time. However, Pascal was also designed so that it could be compiled in 1 pass from top to bottom(the reason being to make compiling fast and simple). Simply put, constants must be definable from the code before it, otherwise the compiler gives an error. For example, this would not compile:
&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
program Fail;
const
    zilch = c-c;
    c = 1;
begin
end.
&lt;/source&gt;

but this will:
&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
program Succeed;
const
    c = 1;
    zilch = c-c;
begin
end.
&lt;/source&gt;
It should be noted that in standard Pascal, constants must be defined before anything else (most compilers wont enforce it though). Constants may also be typed but must be in this form: &lt;code&gt;identifier: type = value;&lt;/code&gt;.

==Variables==

Variables must first be declared and typed under the &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; like so:
&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
var
    number: integer;
&lt;/source&gt;
You can also define multiple variables with the same type like this:
&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
var
    number,othernumber: integer;
&lt;/source&gt;
Declaration tells the compiler to pick a place in memory for the variable. The type tells compiler how the variable is formatted. A variable's value can be changed at run time like this: &lt;code&gt;variable := value&lt;/code&gt;. There are more types but, we will concentrate on these for now:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! type
! definition
|-
| integer
| a whole number from -32768 to 32767

== Reading, skimming, browsing ==
I am introducing the subsection on browsing here under the general category of reading.
The goal is to find a user-friendly was to talk about the browsers.

The browsers themselves: Chrome, Firefox, Explorer will be introduced much later in the Wikibook, perhaps under ... ? --[[User:Mihal Orela|Михал Орела]] ([[User talk:Mihal Orela|talk]]) 06:23, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

I have introduced a short list (using one word) of some popular browsers.

==Translation==

# The Master said, &quot;Is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application? Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters? Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?&quot;
# The philosopher You said, &quot;They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion. The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission! - are they not the root of all benevolent actions?&quot;
# The Master said, &quot;Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.&quot;
# The philosopher Zeng said, &quot;I daily examine myself on three points: whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful; whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere; whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.&quot;
# The Master said, &quot;To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.&quot;
# The Master said, &quot;A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.&quot;
# Zi Xia said, &quot;If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere - although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has.&quot;
# The Master said, &quot;If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid. Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.&quot;
# The philosopher Zeng said, &quot;Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice - then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence.&quot;
# Zi Qin asked Zi Gong, saying, &quot;When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?&quot; Zi Gong said, &quot;Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information! - is it not different from that of other men?&quot;
# The Master said, &quot;While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.&quot;
# The philosopher You said, &quot;In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them. Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done.&quot;
# The philosopher You said, &quot;When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters.&quot;
# The Master said, &quot;He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified - such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.&quot;
# Zi Gong said, &quot;What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud?&quot; The Master replied, &quot;They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.&quot; Zi Gong replied, &quot;It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.' - The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed.&quot; The Master said, &quot;With one like Ci, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence.&quot;
# The Master said, &quot;I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;Saptarishis Astrology&lt;/big&gt;''' 

Saptarishis Astrology is a Free multi-lingual E- Magazine incorporating all systems of astrology, mysticism &amp; various holistic sciences that aims to improve the quality of ones life. We desire to provide a global platform to net-based astrologers. Additionally, it focuses on bringing out hidden rare masters from villages of India who though are unable to communicate in English yet have uncanny mastery of the science preserved through generations.

'''&lt;big&gt;Volunteers&lt;/big&gt;''' 

The Saptarishis Astrology Magazine's Core Team consists of volunteer astrologers, astrology research scholars, designers, and managers who, together with a dedicated work group have taken the dream of launching digital magazine. Saptarishis Astrology represents the new era of astrology publishing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello,

I do not mind helping a bit on this project...its definately worthwile and is something I cpould definately have done with having just finished some a-level maths course (B). 

I think the pages need to be smaller and more bite-sized though and we need to add the synbols for completeness....i.e. collecting like terms together needs to be on its own.

If we can invent solutions and answers it would be good too :)</text>

{{status|0%}} __NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
This book is a guide and resource for those who intend to live in the United Kingdom, not only for those that want to come to Britain from other countries and cultures, but also for those who are growing up in Britain and want to know more about the land in which they live. Relevant British laws, society, geography, traditions and values, among many other key aspects of life, will be approached from two angles; how to best integrate with and support British society and how to get the best from society for yourself.

This is not intended as a tourist's guide, though there is nothing to prevent it from being used in this manner. As English is the most commonly spoken language in the UK, knowledge of English is vital for substantial communication across the social spectrum, so to that end the book is written in English, and therefore '''at least conversational knowledge of English is required'''.

The book aims to be as neutral and non-judgemental as possible, while being a true and useful source of information. This is not necessarily a complete source of information, many of the chapters can and do have large numbers of books written about the subject they concern, but links and references will be provided where possible.

For those that do not wish to integrate with society in the UK, the choice remains with you whether to read this book and what to take from it. For those that do, I hope that you find this book a useful resource; please feel free to make suggestions or edit the book yourself if you feel something is missing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=

The ability to simplify and manage algebraic equations is a fundamental tool you will need in order to successfully complete your studies. You will have covered many of what is going to be described below in earlier courses. However it will serve as a useful reminder tool when it comes to working on equations in later modules. 

Some of you may already know this and may decide to skip sections. However it will serve as a tool for finding out where certain parts of any examples have gone if more than 1 step is combined.

==Expressions and Terms==

All algebraic equations can be considered as a series of expressions. On each side of the equals '=' sign there will be an expression. For example:

 &lt;math&gt;5x + 2x = 7 &lt;/math&gt;
 
 contains the expressions &lt;math&gt;(5x + 2x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(7)&lt;/math&gt;

Within each expression, there will be a number of terms. A term is any variable, number, or algebraic letter. In the equation above we can say that there are three terms. These three terms are:

 &lt;math&gt;5x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;7&lt;/math&gt;

Now what is key to all equations is simplifying what they say, that is reducing the length of the expression by collecting like terms together. We have seen that the equation above technically has three terms. Let us break down a term further.

 The term &lt;math&gt;5x&lt;/math&gt; has a coefficient of &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; and a variable of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

When you simplify an expression, you simply collect the like terms together. In other words, you collect the terms with the same variables together.

So taking our very first equation: &lt;math&gt;5x + 2x = 7 &lt;/math&gt; we can see that the terms &lt;math&gt;5x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;+2x&lt;/math&gt; contain the same variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. They can therefore be added together to obtain &lt;math&gt;7x&lt;/math&gt;

So, From above we can see that like terms can only be collected together in order to simplify an expression and hence an equation. Terms which do not contain identical variables cannot be simplified. The exaples below show collecting like and unlike terms together.

===Example 1===

''Simplify the expression &lt;math&gt;5x^2 + 2x + 3x + 5 + 7&lt;/math&gt;''

The Table to the right shows the number of terms with each variable.
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
! Variable
! Number of Terms
|- 
| &lt;Math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| 1
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
|2
|-
|No Variable
|2
|}

Reading this table we can see that:

*There is only 1 term in &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;5x^2)&lt;/math&gt; and so it cannot be simplified.
*There are two terms in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;+2x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;+3x&lt;/math&gt;) so these can be added.
*There are two terms with no variable &lt;math&gt;+5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;+7&lt;/math&gt; and these can be added.

Therefore after simplifying the expression we finish with &lt;math&gt;5x^2 + 5x + 12&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 2===

''Simplify the expression &lt;math&gt;3x^2 + 2x + 2y - 4y - 3x +x^2 -xy&lt;/math&gt;''

Using the rules stated above the expression can be simplified to:

&lt;math&gt;4x^2 - x - 2y - xy&lt;/math&gt;

===Single Variables===

In example 2 above we ended up with the term &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt;. It is important to note that when there is just a variable, with no apparent coefficient, the coefficient is in fact 1. 

* &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;-1x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;1xy&lt;/math&gt;

= The Basics =

Hello and welcome, new subject of the UK! This chapter should be a resource containing essential information you need to get started. We will start off with a discussion of money, and a brief overview of how the monetary system in the country works. This will be followed by sections that detail some of the the types of food, transport, accommodation and conveniences that can be bought. Another section looks at the types of services provided by society, and then the established social structure within Britain is discussed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Usage ==
This template uses a parser function to create the table start and finish. The general syntax is:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Japanese vocabulary entry|begin}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry
 | english = 
 | japanese= 
 | reading = 
 | notes = 
}}
...
{{Japanese vocabulary entry|end}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Only the variables &lt;code&gt;english&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;japanese&lt;/code&gt; are required.

There are three further variables, &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;en-style&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ja-style&lt;/code&gt;, through which one can style the table row and -data.

== Example ==

= Money =

This section is a quick overview of what the monetary system in the UK consists of and how money is used, obtained and spent. Currency itself is a fairly crude method of representing the value of human effort, but love it or loathe it, money is essential for life in the UK today. The use of money is a skill that becomes intuitive with practice; it is a game that is simple to learn but virtually impossible to master. The worth a currency holds relies on the trust of the people that use it that the currency is worth something.

Money in the UK is generally used in denominations of pounds and pence (International Symbol: GBP) represented physically, symbolically or electronically. One penny is currently the smallest amount of GBP you can have, and there are one hundred of these to a pound. 

== How to use money ==

In holding money, either in physical form or in electronic or symbolic representations, you are using it. You consider the money to be worth a certain amount of food, human labour or comfort, and through this the money has a purpose in holding its own value. However this purpose becomes much more tangible when the use is actualised through the money being spent or invested in human labour or commodities.

In the medium to long term, money is typically held in electronic form in an account at a bank. Banks in the UK typically do not require you to pay them directly for this service; any money you deposit to the bank you can withdraw again. The banks gain from keeping some of the interest gained on the money held, and through penalty charges invoked by violation of a consumer agreement by customers.

Particularly in the short term, but also in the long term, money can be held in physical form as cash. The convenience of cash is that it is easily portable and accepted practically everywhere. Some people prefer to use cash over electronic payment methods such as debit or credit cards as these methods could potentially allow tracking of consumer usage and counteract anonymity. Due to its less traceable nature, cash can also be used to attempt tax evasion by disreputable tradespeople.

== How to spend money ==

Typically something on which money can be spent has an advertised value. This may be relatively fixed, as in the price of a loaf of bread, or fluctuate rapidly, as can happen with shares held in a company. To exchange money for commodities or services, an interaction has to take place. This can be in person, over a telephone conversation, electronically, or via a previous agreement. &lt;!-- To exchange money in person, --&gt;

The difference between spending and investing is almost transparent; that is, in spending the money, you intend to consume the resource that the money is spent on, whereas an investment is made in the hope of obtaining a monetary profit. However an argument could be made that any spending of money is also an investment. To give an example, a human needs to consume food to live. The economy of society would suffer slightly if the human died, and therefore the spending of money on food is a justified investment by society as a whole. This thought process can be extended to luxuries on the basis that happier people work more productively.

{{recipe}}

This potato casserole recipe is a long-time favorite in Utah.

==Ingredients==
* 32 oz. bag of frozen hash browns (you can also use those frozen potatoes O'Brien that have chunks of peppers in them)
* 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
* 1 can cream of chicken soup
* 1 cup sour cream
* 1/4 cup melted butter (you can omit this to save calories)
* 1/2 cup chopped green onions (some people call these scallions or spring onions) (you can omit the onions if you don't like them)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 1 cup corn flakes tossed with 1 tablespoon melted butter for topping

==Procedure==
You just take everything above except the corn flake topping, stir it all up in a big bowl, and dump the mixture into an 11x13 glass baking dish.  If you want the corn flake topping, then sprinkle that on top before baking.  Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  It's done when it is all bubbly and a little bit browned on top.  This is super fattening but very good. You can reduce the fat by using low fat cheese and fat free sour cream, and omit the butter.  You can also use low fat cream of chicken soup.

==Notes==
*You can mince up a white or yellow onion and put it in the dish in place of green onion.
*For a mild onion flavor you could substitute chives for the green onions.

'''Aragorn''' is a character in the Lord of the Rings trilogy series. He plays the part of a very strong, very athletic, and very good fighting warrior, who is part of the fellowship ( a group of nine people who set off in [[The Fellowship of the Ring]], first of the trilogy, to destroy a ring created by [[Sauron]] to rule all of Middle-Earth.
__TOC__

== Character ==
Aragorn has been described as a [[ranger]], one of the nomadic soldiers who protect the lands on their own. He is, however, the last in a long forgotten line of kings, the heir of [[Isildur]], king of [[Gondor]]. He comes to realize his fate to be the king in the third book, [[The Return of the King]], and claims the throne after the destruction of the dark lord '''Sauron'''. He is humble, strong, and very agile, and comes from the race of the Numenor. 

== Friends ==
Aragorn befriends ( throughout the journey ) an elf, named [[Legolas]]. He also becomes friends with a stubborn Dwarf known as [[Gimli]] during the long journey to destroy the ring. Other people who might be considered by Aragorn as friends are: [[Gandalf]], [[Eomer]], [[Theoden]], [[Frodo]], Eowyn and the rest of the Fellowship.

== Part in the first book ==
In '''The Fellowship of the Ring''', Aragorn meets Frodo, [[Pippin]], [[Merry]], and [[Sam]] in the '''Prancing Pony Inn''' on a rainy night. He sees them from a croner, a dark corner. They see him, and Frodo inquires to the bar manager, &quot;That man, in the corner. Who is he?&quot; The bar manager says to Frodo, &quot;He is one of them Rangers. Dangerous folk they are.&quot; Frodo then averts his eyes, hoping not to startle Aragorn, formerly known in the first book as Strider. 
&lt;p&gt;In the first book, Aragorn leads the group of four to Rivendell, the place of the Elves and where the council was made to make the company of nine, the &quot;Fellowship,&quot; set off to destroy the ring. He was formerly known by the hobbits as &quot;Strider&quot; due to the fact that he did not reveal his true name. Aragorn plated the part of the &quot;Swordsman&quot; during the journey. In the '''Mines of Moria''' Aragorn fought gallantly to protect the Hobbits from a massive Cave Troll that attacked their party. In '''Lothlorien''', later in the book, Aragorn comes to realize the fate of the Ringbearer, '''Frodo'''. He then reminds frodo of his oath to protect him, after Frodo escapes from the company to save them, only to find Aragorn and be frightened of him. In the end of the book, Aragorn is seen along with '''Legolas''' and '''Gimli''' &quot;hunting&quot; the orcs that took '''Merry''' and '''Pippin''' captive, and were heading off to Isengard.&lt;/p&gt;

== Part in the Second Book ==
In the Second book, [[The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers]], Aragorn is first seen with companions Legolas and Gimli hunting after a party of '''Uruk-Hai''' that had recently taken hostage '''Merry and Pippin'''.

==Introduction to Information Literacy== 


We are an information society. At least 61.8 percent of homes in the United States had a computer in 2003 (EarthTrends: World Resources Institute). More than likely that number has increased in the past five years. Everywhere we turn we hear or see how technology is being used to better learning and understanding in our school systems and workplace. There are so many different web sources that many people do not pick up dictionaries, encyclopedias, or journals for research. With all of these sources available for people it is hard to tell which sources are credible. Regardless of whether you are in the education system or not, every one must have not only reading skills and computer skills but information skills, too (http://www.ed.gov/pubs/UnderLit/understanding.html) . The US Secretary of Labor's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS Report), included information competency among its five essential workplace competencies for the 21st century.

Information literacy is the ability to access, evaluate, organize, and use information from a variety of sources—books, CD-ROMS, newspapers, videos, or the web. Information literacy requires an awareness of the way in which information systems work, of the dynamic link between a particular information need and the sources and channels required to satisfy that need (Darch et al. 1997). Being information literate requires knowing how to recognize the need for information; identify potential sources for information; develop successful search strategies; access sources of information including computer-based and other technologies; evaluate information, use information and critical thinking and problem solving (Valenza, 1998).

The goal of information literacy is to move people away from textbook learning and into using a variety of sources to learn. Because information literacy gives people a variety of sources to choose from, there are some concerns about information literacy. Many people can manipulate information on the web or create sites with faulty information; therefore, people must know how to determine if information is reliable.

==Information Sources==  
Information sources that all students should have access to.

*'''Abstracts'''--are among the most important sources to researchers because they contain content summaries of the articles, books and other materials. Example: Social work abstract sIndex area of stacks in reference
*'''Dictionaries'''--are alphabetical listings of words, phrases, and other terms. These may be consulted for explanations of meaning or usage. Example: International dictionary of psychology 
*'''Encyclopedias'''--provide topical descriptions and elaborations of meaning. They may be general and cover many subjects or be quite specific to a particular field or subject. Often short bibliographies of additional sources are appended to the articles. Example: Encyclopedia of education
*'''Field guides'''--are practical handbooks that provide reference data, charts and sketches for identification and similar data. Example: Birds of North America : a guide to field identification
*'''Guides'''--explain and illustrate a topic. Example: American armies and battlefields in Europe; a history, guide, and reference book
*'''Guides to the literature'''--these are selected bibliographies, often arranged in topical order. Example: Guide to information sources: chemistry
*'''Handbooks'''--are often a compilation of reference data and a kind of one-volume topical reference library. Example: Handbook of chemistry and physics
*'''Indexes'''--these are alphabetically arranged listings of journal and book contents, typically subdivided by author and subject. Example: Reader's guide to periodical literature
*'''Manuals'''--these generally contain instructions on particular topics. Example: The Merck manual of diagnosis and therapy
*'''Maps'''--while often geographical, astronomical maps are another example of a reference that shows the proximity of one locations or object in relation to others. Example: Topographical maps located in map cases
*'''Reviewing sources'''--these provide an evaluation or summary of the content of particular media, whether books, journal articles or films and videos. Example: Book review digest
*'''Tables'''--these bring together reference data, formula and statistics that are frequently or infrequently used. For example, interest tables contain amortization tables for loan amounts and the monthly payments at particular interest rates. Example: CRC standard mathematical tables
*'''Yearbooks'''--these provide up-to-date information on topics where information is changing periodically. For example, a political yearbooks might contain listings of state representatives, congressmen, or heads of state. Example: China yearbook

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Washington moves to New York==
When Washington heard that the Brtish were going to attack New York, he took the Army, and stationed it in present day New York City. 
==The British Mass Troops==
General Sir William Howe, with the services of his brother, Admiral Lord Howe, began amassing troops on Staten Island in July 1776. General Washington, with a smaller army of about 19,000 men, was uncertain where the Howes intended to strike. He unwittingly violated a cardinal rule of warfare and divided his troops about equally in the face of a stronger opponent. The Continental Army was split between Long Island and Manhattan, thus allowing the stronger British forces to engage only one half of the smaller Continental Army at a time. In late August, the British transported another 22,000 men (including 9,000 &quot;Hessians&quot;) to Long Island.
==The Battle of Long Island==
On August 22, 1776, Colonel Edward Hand sent word to Lieutenant General George Washington that the British were preparing to cross The Narrows to Brooklyn from Staten Island.

Under the overall command of Howe, and the operational command of Major Generals Charles Cornwallis and Sir Henry Clinton, the British force numbered over 30,000. The British commenced their landing in Gravesend Bay, where, after having strengthened his forces for over seven weeks on Staten Island, Admiral Richard Howe moved 88 frigates. The British landed a total of 34,000 men south of Brooklyn.
[[Image:Battle-of-Long-Island-Map-sml.jpg|thumb|250px|A map of the Battle of Long Island]]
About half of Washington's army, led by Major General Israel Putnam, was deployed to defend the village of Flatbush near Brooklyn while the rest held Manhattan. In a night march suggested and led by Clinton, the British forces used the lightly defended Jamaica Pass to turn Putnam's left flank. The following morning, American troops were attacked and fell back. Men under General William Alexander numbering about 400 fought a delaying action at the Old Stone House near the Gowanus Creek, attacking and counter-attacking a British artillery position there and sustaining over 50% casualties. This significantly aided the withdrawal of most of Washington's army to fortifications on Brooklyn Heights.

===American Evacuation===
Later in the day, the British paused. This was not unusual in combat of the time, as horrendous casualties could result from point-blank musket fire and hand-to-hand combat; even the winner of such a battle could find himself unable to proceed. It was not uncommon for a commander, certain of the numerical and tactical superiority of his force, to offer a cornered enemy the option to surrender and thus avoid further bloodshed with the ultimate outcome of the battle certain. If formal surrender terms were not offered, the commander in a hopeless situation could at least be afforded an opportunity to consider his situation and, presumably, decide to surrender. It appears that this happened here; the British commanders surely remembered the Battle of Bunker Hill and the casualties they suffered in that pyrrhic victory.

During the night of August 29-August 30, 1776, having lost the battle, the Americans evacuated Long Island for Manhattan. Not wanting to have anymore casualties, the Americans devised a plan. This evacuation of more than 9,000 troops required stealth and luck and the skill of Colonel John Glover and his 14th Continental Regiment from Marblehead, Massachusetts. It was not completed by sunrise as scheduled, and had a heavy fog not beset Long Island in the morning, the army may have been trapped between the British and the East River. However, the maneuver took the British by complete surprise. Even having lost the battle, Washington's withdrawal earned him praise from both the Americans and the British.

==Kip's Bay and Harlem Heights==
===Kip's Bay===
On September 15, the British landed a few thousand troops at the lightly defended Kip's Bay, Manhattan. Washington had left his main force up at the then small village of Harlem where he believed the main British assault would come. The American defender at Kip's Bay were bombared by the British ships, then, attacked by landing British troops. After Washington had heard of the landing, he came down and attampted to rally his men, but they continued their disorganized retreat. Washington became so frustrated that he threw his hat to the ground and shouted, &quot;Are these the men with which I am to defend America?&quot; When some fleeing men refused to turn and engage a party of advancing Hessians, Washington is said to have flogged some of their officers with his riding crop. After this, he is to have said to have been so depressed he just sat on his horse while the enemy advanced on him, a mere 80 yards away, until an aide came to him. 

As more and more British soldiers came ashore, including light infantry, grenadiers, and Hessian Jägers, they spread out, advancing in several directions. By late afternoon, another 9000 British troops had landed at Kip's Bay and sent a brigade down to abandoned New York, officially taking possession. While most of the Americans managed to escape to the north, not all got away.

===Harlem Heights===
[[Image:Harlem Heights.jpg|thumb|250px|Painting of the Battle of Harlem Heights]]
Knowlton's Rangers, a group of scouts, moved out before dawn on September 16th. At sunrise the party encountered the British pickets by a farmhouse. As the party approached the farmhouse they were spotted by the British from the picketline. As brief skirmish broke out, but when the British began to turn on the American flank, Knowlton ordered an organized retreat.

The American rangers were followed through the woods and field of Harlem by British Light troops. The British troops began to sing and sounded their bugle horns to signal that it was a fox-chase. Upon hearing this, an officer went to Washington and asked for reinforcements. Washington was reluctant but he devised a plan to entrap the British troops. The plan was to make a feint in front of a hill, and then draw the British troops into a hollow while waiting for the flanking part to entrap them. The plan worked, and the British troops were drawn into the hollow.
[[Image:Battle of Harlem Heights Map.JPG|thumb|250px|Map of the Battle of Harlem Heights]]
The flanking party arrived an hour later. It consisted of Knowlton's Rangers, which had been reinforced by three companies of riflemen, in total about 200 men. As they approached, an officer accidently mislead the men and firing broke out, causing the flanking movement to fail. The British troops, realizing their position, retreated to a field, in which there was a fence. The Americans soon pursued, and during the attack Knowlton was killed. Despite his death, the American troops pushed on, driving the British troops beyond the fence to the top of a hill. For two hours, the British troops held their ground at the top of the hill. However, the Americans, once again, overwhelmed the British troops and forced them to retreat into a Buckwheat field.

Washington had originally been reluctant to pursue the British troops, but after seeing that his men were fighting with fine spirit and dash, sent in reinforcements and permitted the troops to engage in a direct attack. By the time all of the reinforcements arrived, nearly 1,800 Americans were engaged in the Buckwheat Field. To direct the battle, members of Washington's staff such as Nathanael Greene were sent in. During this time, the British troops were also reinforced.

Despite being outnumbered, the British troops held their positions against the American assault. For nearly two hours the battle continued in the field and in the surrounding hills. Finally, the British troops were compelled to withdraw, but the Americans kept up close pursuit. The chase continued until it was heard that the British reserves were coming, and Washington ordered a withdrawal.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

      <minor />
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==

The UK shipping forecast is prepared by the UK met office 4 times a day and published on the radio, the [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/marine/shipping_forecast.html Met Office web site]  and the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast/shipping/index.shtml BBC web site].  However it is not available in a computer readable form.

Tim Duckett recently blogged about [http://www.adoptioncurve.net/archives/2008/03/twittering-the-shipping-forecast.php creating a Twitter stream]. He uses Ruby to parse the text forecast. The textual form of the forecast is included on both the Met Office and BBC  sites. However as Tim points out, the format is designed for speech, compresses similar areas to reduce the time slot and is hard to parse.  The approach taken here is to scrape a JavaScript file containing the raw area forecast data.


==Implementation ==
=== Dependancies ===
==== eXist-db  Modules ==== 
The following scripts use these eXist modules:
* request - to get HTTP request parameters
* httpclient  - to GET and POST
* scheduler - to schedule scrapping tasks
* dateTime - to format dateTimes
* util - base64 conversions
* xmldb - for database access

==== Other ====
* UK Met office web site

==Met Office page ==

The Met office page shows an area-by-area forecast but this part of the page is generated by JavaScript from data in a [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/lib/includes/marine/gale_and_shipping_table.js generated JavaScript file]. In this file, the data is assigned to multiple arrays. A typical section looks like

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// Bailey
gale_in_force[28] = &quot;0&quot;;
gale[28] = &quot;0&quot;;
galeIssueTime[28] = &quot;&quot;;
shipIssueTime[28] = &quot;1725 Sun 06 Jul&quot;;
wind[28] = &quot;Northeast 5 to 7.&quot;;
weather[28] = &quot;Showers.&quot;;
visibility[28] = &quot;Moderate or good.&quot;;
seastate[28] = &quot;Moderate or rough.&quot;;
area[28] = &quot;Bailey&quot;;
area_presentation[28] = &quot;Bailey&quot;;
key[28] = &quot;Bailey&quot;;

// Faeroes
...
&lt;/source&gt;

== Area Forecast ==

=== JavaScript conversion ===

This function fetches the current JavaScript data using the  eXist httpclient module, converts the base64 data to a string, picks out the required area data and parses the code to generate an XML structure using the JavaScript array names. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace httpclient = &quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/httpclient&quot;;

declare function met:get-forecast($area as xs:string) as element(forecast)? {
 let $jsuri := &quot;http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/lib/includes/marine/gale_and_shipping_table.js&quot;
(: fetch the javascript source  and locate the text of the body of the response :)
  let $base64:= httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($jsuri),true(),())/httpclient:body/text()
(: this is base64 encoded , so decode it back to text :)
  let $js :=  util:binary-to-string($base64)
(: isolate the section for the required area, prefixed with a comment
  let $areajs :=  normalize-space(substring-before( substring-after($js,concat(&quot;// &quot;,$area)),&quot;//&quot;))
 return 
   if($areajs =&quot;&quot;)  (: area not found :)
   then ()
   else 
(: build an XML element containing elements for each of the data items, using the array names as the element names :)

&lt;forecast&gt;
{
for $d in tokenize($areajs,&quot;;&quot;)[position() &lt; last()] (: JavaScript statements terminated by &quot;;&quot; - ignore the last empty :)
   let $ds := tokenize(normalize-space($d),&quot; *= *&quot;) (: separate the LHS and RHS of the assignment statement :)
   return 
     element {replace(substring-before($ds[1],&quot;[&quot;),&quot;_&quot;,&quot;&quot;)}(: element name is  the array name, converted to a legal name :)
             {replace($ds[2],'&quot;','')}  (: element text is the RHS minus quotes :)
}
&lt;/forecast&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, the output for one selected area is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;forecast&gt;
    &lt;galeinforce&gt;0&lt;/galeinforce&gt;
    &lt;gale&gt;0&lt;/gale&gt;
    &lt;galeIssueTime/&gt;
    &lt;shipIssueTime&gt;0505 Mon 07 Jul&lt;/shipIssueTime&gt;
    &lt;wind&gt;Northwest backing west 5 to 7.&lt;/wind&gt;
    &lt;weather&gt;Squally showers.&lt;/weather&gt;
    &lt;visibility&gt;Moderate or good.&lt;/visibility&gt;
    &lt;seastate&gt;Moderate or rough.&lt;/seastate&gt;
    &lt;area&gt;Fastnet&lt;/area&gt;
    &lt;areapresentation&gt;Fastnet&lt;/areapresentation&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;Fastnet&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;/forecast&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Format the forecast as text ===

The forecast data needs to be formatted into a string:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:forecast-as-text($forecast as element(forecast)) as xs:string {
      concat( $forecast/weather,
              &quot; Wind &quot;,  $forecast/wind,
              &quot; Visibility &quot;, $forecast/visibility, 
              &quot; Sea &quot;, $forecast/seastate
            )
}; 

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Area Forecast ===

Finally these functions can be used in a script which accepts a shipping area name and returns an XML message:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

import module namespace met = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/met&quot; at &quot;met.xqm&quot;;

let $area := request:get-parameter(&quot;area&quot;,&quot;Lundy&quot;)
let $forecast := met:get-forecast($area)
return
   &lt;message area=&quot;{$area}&quot;  dateTime=&quot;{$forecast/shipIssueTime}&quot;&gt;
       {met:forecast-as-text($forecast)} 
   &lt;/message&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Met/shipping.xq Lundy ]
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Met/shipping.xq?area=Fastnet Fastnet]

== Message abbreviation ==
To create a message suitable for texting (160 characters), or tweeting (140 character limit), the message can compressed by abbreviating common words. 


=== Abbreviation dictionary ===

A dictionary of words and abbreviations is created and stored locally.  The dictionary has been developed using some of the abbreviations in Tim Duckett's Ruby implementation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;dictionary&gt;
 &lt;entry  full=&quot;west&quot; abbrev=&quot;W&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;entry  full=&quot;westerly&quot; abbrev=&quot;Wly&quot;/&gt;
..
 &lt;entry  full=&quot;variable&quot; abbrev=&quot;vbl&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;entry  full=&quot;visibility&quot; abbrev=&quot;viz&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;entry  full=&quot;occasionally&quot; abbrev=&quot;occ&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;entry  full=&quot;showers&quot; abbrev=&quot;shwrs&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/dictionary&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Met/shippingdictionary.xml The full dictionary]

=== Abbreviation function ===
The abbreviation function breaks down the text into words, replaces  words with abbreviations and builds the text up again:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:abbreviate($forecast as xs:string) as xs:string {
   string-join(
(: lowercase the string, append a space (to ensure a final . is matched) and tokenise :)
      for $word in tokenize(concat(lower-case($forecast),&quot; &quot;),&quot;\.? +&quot;)
      return
(: if there is an entry for the word , use its abbreviation, otherwise use the unabbreviated word :)
        ( /dictionary/entry[@full=$word]/@abbrev,$word) [1]
        ,
      &quot; &quot;) (: join the words back up with space separator :)  
};

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Abbreviated Message  ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

import module namespace met = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/met&quot; at &quot;met.xqm&quot;;
let $area := request:get-parameter(&quot;area&quot;,&quot;Lundy&quot;)
let $forecast := met:get-forecast($area)
return
   &lt;message area=&quot;{$area}&quot;  dateTime=&quot;{$forecast/shipIssueTime}&quot;&gt;
       {met:abbreviate(met:forecast-as-text($forecast))} 
   &lt;/message&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Met/shippingabbrev.xq Lundy]
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Met/shippingabbrev.xq?area=Fastnet Fastnet]

== All Areas forecast ==

This function is an extension of the area forecast.  The parse uses the comment separator to break up the script, ignores the first and last sections and the area name in the comment

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:get-forecast() as element(forecast)* {
  let $jsuri := &quot;http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/lib/includes/marine/gale_and_shipping_table.js&quot;
  let $base64:= httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($jsuri),true(),())/httpclient:body/text()
  let $js :=  util:binary-to-string($base64)
  for $js in tokenize($js,&quot;// &quot;)[position() &gt; 1] [position()&lt; last()]
  let $areajs := concat(&quot;gale&quot;,substring-after($js,&quot;gale&quot;))
  return      
&lt;forecast&gt;
{
for $d in tokenize($areajs,&quot;;&quot;)[position() &lt; last()]
   let $ds := tokenize(normalize-space($d),&quot; *= *&quot;)
   return 
     element {replace(substring-before($ds[1],&quot;[&quot;),&quot;_&quot;,&quot;&quot;)}
                     {replace($ds[2],'&quot;','')}
}
&lt;/forecast&gt;
};

&lt;/source&gt;


=== XML version of forecast ===

This script returns the full Shipping forecast in XML:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace met = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/met&quot; at &quot;met.xqm&quot;;

&lt;ShippingForecast&gt;
    {met:get-forecast()}
&lt;/ShippingForecast&gt;
       
&lt;/source&gt;

* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Met/shippingfull.xq Execute]

=== RSS version of forecast  ===

XSLT would be suitable for transforming this XML to RSS format ...

== SMS service ==

One possible use of this data would be to provide an SMS on-request service, taking an area name and returning the abbreviated forecast. The complete set of forecasts are created, and the one for the area supplied as the message selected and returned as an abbreviated message. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

import module namespace met = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/met&quot; at &quot;met.xqm&quot;;

let $area := lower-case(request:get-parameter(&quot;text&quot;,()))
let $forecast := met:get-forecast()[lower-case(area) = $area]
return
   if (exists($forecast))
   then 
      concat(&quot;Reply: &quot;, met:abbreviate(met:forecast-as-text($forecast)))
    else 
      concat(&quot;Reply: Area &quot;,$area,&quot; not recognised&quot;)
  
&lt;/source&gt;

The calling protocol is determined here by the SMS service installed at UWE and described [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XQuery/String_Analysis#SMS_service here]

* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Met/met2SMS1.xq?text=lundy Execute]

== Caching ==

Fetching the JavaScript on demand is neither efficient nor acceptable net behaviour, and since the forecast times are known, it is preferable to fetch the data on a schedule, convert to the XML form and save in the eXist database and then use the cached XML  for later requests.

=== Store XML forecast ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace met = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/met&quot; at &quot;met.xqm&quot;;
declare variable $col := &quot;/db/Wiki/Met/Forecast&quot;;

if (xmldb:login($col, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;password&quot;))  (: a user who has write access to the Forecast collection :)
then 
       let $forecast := met:get-forecast()
       let $forecastDateTime := met:timestamp-to-xs-date(($forecast/shipIssueTime)[1])  (: convert to xs:dateTime :)
       let $store :=  xmldb:store( 
              $col,                    (: collection to store forecast in :)
              &quot;shippingForecast.xml&quot;,  (: file name - overwrite is OK here as we only want the latest :)
                                       (: then the constructed XML to be stored :)
              &lt;ShippingForecast  at=&quot;{$forecastDateTime}&quot; &gt;
                   {$forecast}
              &lt;/ShippingForecast&gt;
              ) 
       return
           &lt;result&gt;
               Shipping forecast for {string($forecastDateTime)} stored in  {$store}
          &lt;/result&gt;
else ()

&lt;/source&gt;

The timestamp used on the source data is converting to an xs:dateTime for ease of later processing.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:timestamp-to-xs-date($dt as xs:string) as xs:dateTime {
(: convert timestamps in the form 0505 Tue 08 Jul to xs:dateTime :)
   let $year := year-from-date(current-date())  (: assume the current year since none provided :)
   let $dtp := tokenize($dt,&quot; &quot;)
   let $mon := index-of((&quot;Jan&quot;,&quot;Feb&quot;, &quot;Mar&quot;,&quot;Apr&quot;,&quot;May&quot;, &quot;Jun&quot;,&quot;Jul&quot;,&quot;Aug&quot;,&quot;Sep&quot;,&quot;Oct&quot;,&quot;Nov&quot;,&quot;Dec&quot;),$dtp[4])
   let $monno := if($mon &lt; 10) then concat(&quot;0&quot;,$mon) else $mon
   return xs:dateTime(concat($year,&quot;-&quot;,$monno,&quot;-&quot;,$dtp[3],&quot;T&quot;,substring($dtp[1],1,2),&quot;:&quot;,substring($dtp[1],3,4),&quot;:00&quot;))
};

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Reducing the forecast data ===

The raw data contains redundant elements (several versions of the area name) and elements which are normally empty (all gale related  elements when no gale warning) but lacks a case-normalised area name as a key.  The following function performs this restructuring:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:reduce($forecast as element(forecast)) as element(forecast) {
            &lt;forecast&gt;  
                          { attribute area {lower-case($forecast/area)}}
                          { $forecast/*
                                    [not(name(.) = (&quot;shipIssueTime&quot;,&quot;area&quot;,&quot;key&quot;))] 
                                    [ if (../galeinforce = &quot;0&quot; ) 
                                      then not(name(.) = (&quot;galeinforce&quot;,&quot;gale&quot;,&quot;galeIssueTime&quot;)) 
                                      else true()
                                    ]
                            }
             &lt;/forecast&gt;
};

&lt;/source&gt;

There would be a case to make for using XSLT for this transformation. The caching script applies this transformation to the forecast before saving.

=== SMS via cache ===

The revised SMS script can now access the cache. First a function to get the stored forecast:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:get-stored-forecast($area as xs:string) as element(forecast) {
  doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/Met/Forecast/shippingForecast.xml&quot;)/ShippingForecast/forecast[@area = $area]
};
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace met = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/met&quot; at &quot;met.xqm&quot;;

let $area := lower-case(normalise-space(request:get-parameter(&quot;text&quot;,())))
let $forecast := met:get-stored-forecast($area)
return
   if (exists($forecast))
   then 
      concat(&quot;Reply: &quot;, datetime:format-dateTime($forecast/../@at,&quot;HH:mm&quot;),&quot; &quot;,met:abbreviate(met:forecast-as-text($forecast)))
    else 
      concat(&quot;Reply: Area &quot;,$area,&quot; not recognised&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

In this script, the selected forecast for the input area  extracted by the met function call is a reference to the database element, not a copy.  Thus it is still possible to navigate back to the parent element containing the timestamp.

The eXist datetime functions are wrappers for the Java class [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html java.text.SimpleDateFormat] which defines the date formatting syntax.

* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Met/met2SMS.xq?text=Lundy Lundy]

=== Job scheduling ===

eXist includes a scheduler module which is a wrapper for the [http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/ Quartz scheduler].  Jobs can only be created by a DBA user. 

For example, to set a job to fetch the shipping forecast on the hour, 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $login := xmldb:login( &quot;/db&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;admin password&quot; ) 
let $job := scheduler:schedule-xquery-cron-job(&quot;/db/Wiki/Met/getandsave.xq&quot; , &quot;0 0 * * * ?&quot;)
return $job
&lt;/source&gt;

where &quot;0 0 * * * ?&quot; means to run at 0 seconds, 0 minutes past every hour of every day of every month, ignoring the day of the week. 

To check on the set of scheduled jobs, including system schedule jobs:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $login := xmldb:login( &quot;/db&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;admin password&quot; ) 
return scheduler:get-scheduled-jobs()
&lt;/source&gt;

It would be better to schedule jobs on the basis of the update schedule for the forecast. These times are 0015, 0505, 1130 and 1725. These times cannot be fitted into a single cron pattern so multiple jobs are required.  Because jobs are identified by their path, the same url cannot be used for all instances, so a dummy parameter is added. 

''Discussion''
The times are one minute later than the published times. This may not be enough slack to account for discrepancies in timing on both sides. Clearly a push from the UK Met Office would be better than the pull scraping. The scheduler clock runs in local time (BST) as are the publication times.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $login := xmldb:login( &quot;/db&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;admin password&quot; ) 
let $job1 := scheduler:schedule-xquery-cron-job(&quot;/db/Wiki/Met/getandsave.xq?t=1&quot; , &quot;0 16 0 * * ?&quot;)
let $job2 := scheduler:schedule-xquery-cron-job(&quot;/db/Wiki/Met/getandsave.xq?t=2&quot; , &quot;0 6 5 * * ?&quot;)
let $job3 := scheduler:schedule-xquery-cron-job(&quot;/db/Wiki/Met/getandsave.xq?t=3&quot; , &quot;0 31 11 * * ?&quot;)
let $job4 := scheduler:schedule-xquery-cron-job(&quot;/db/Wiki/Met/getandsave.xq?t=4&quot; , &quot;0 26 17 * * ?&quot;)
return ($job1, $job2, $job3, $job4)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Forecast as kml ==

=== Sea area coordinates ===
The UK Met Office provides a [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/marine/shipping_forecast.html clickable map] of forecasts but a KML map would be nice. The [http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/tempusfugit/marine/area_coord.htm coordinates] of the sea areas can be captured and manually converted to XML.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;boundaries&gt;
    &lt;boundary area=&quot;viking&quot;&gt;
        &lt;point latitude=&quot;61&quot; longitude=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;point latitude=&quot;61&quot; longitude=&quot;4&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;point latitude=&quot;58.5&quot; longitude=&quot;4&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;point latitude=&quot;58.5&quot; longitude=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/boundary&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

The boundary for an area is accessed by two functions.  In this idiom one function hides the document location and returns the root of the document.  Subsequence functions use this base function to get the docuement and then apply further predicates to filter as required.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:area-boundaries() as element(boundaries) {
  doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/Met/shippingareas.xml&quot;)/boundaries
};

declare function met:area-boundary($area as xs:string) as element(boundary) {
   met:area-boundaries()/boundary[@area=$area]
};

&lt;/source&gt;

The centre of an area can be roughly computed by averaging the latitudes and longitudes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

declare function met:area-centre($boundary as element(boundary)) as element(point) {
   &lt;point 
      latitude=&quot;{round(sum($boundary/point/@latitude) div count($boundary/point) * 100) div 100}&quot;
      longitude=&quot;{round(sum($boundary/point/@longitude) div count($boundary/point) * 100) div 100}&quot;
   /&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== kml Placemark ===
We can generate a kml PlaceMark from a forecast:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:forecast-to-kml($forecast as element(forecast)) as element(Placemark) {
   let $area := $forecast/@area
   let $boundary := met:area-boundary($area)
   let $centre := met:area-centre($boundary)
   
   return 
     &lt;Placemark &gt;
        &lt;name&gt;{string($forecast/areapresentation)}&lt;/name&gt;
         &lt;description&gt;
           {met:forecast-as-text($forecast)}
         &lt;/description&gt;
         &lt;Point&gt;
             &lt;coordinates&gt;
                 {string-join(($centre/@longitude,$centre/@latitude),&quot;,&quot;)}
             &lt;/coordinates&gt;
         &lt;/Point&gt;
    &lt;/Placemark&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== kml area area ===

Since we have the area coordinates, we can also generate the boundaries as a line in kml.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:sea-area-to-kml(
    $area as xs:string, 
    $showname as xs:boolean
    ) as element(Placemark)
 {
   let $boundary := met:area-boundary($area)
   return 
     &lt;Placemark &gt;
        {if($showname) then &lt;name&gt;{$area}&lt;/name&gt; else()}
        &lt;LineString&gt;
            &lt;coordinates&gt;
            {string-join(
               for $point in $boundary/point
               return
                   string-join(($point/@longitude,$point/@latitude,&quot;0&quot;),&quot;,&quot;)
                , &quot; &quot;
                )
             }
            &lt;/coordinates&gt;
         &lt;/LineString&gt;
      &lt;/Placemark&gt;
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Generate the kml file ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module  namespace met = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/met&quot; at &quot;met.xqm&quot;;

(: set the media type for a kml file :)
declare option exist:serialize  &quot;method=xml indent=yes 
     media-type=application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml&quot;; 
     
(: set the file name ans extension when saved to allow GoogleEarth to be invoked :)
let $dummy := response:set-header('Content-Disposition','inline;filename=shipping.kml;')

(: get the latest forecast :)
let $shippingForecast := met:get-stored-forecast()

return
&lt;kml &gt;
   &lt;Folder&gt;
       &lt;name&gt;{datetime:format-dateTime($shippingForecast/@at,&quot;EEEE HH:mm&quot;)} UK Met Office Shipping forecast&lt;/name&gt;
       {for $forecast in $shippingForecast/forecast
        return 
         (met:forecast-to-kml($forecast),
          met:sea-area-to-kml($forecast/@area,false())
         )
       }
   &lt;/Folder&gt;
&lt;/kml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Met/forecast2kml.xq raw kml]

== Push messages ==

An alternative use of this data is to provide a channel to push the forecasts through as soon as they are received.  The channel could be a SMS alert to subscribers or a dedicated Twitter stream which users could follow.

=== Subscription SMS ===

This service should allow a user to request an alert for a specific area or areas.  The application requires:

* a data structure to record subscribers and their areas
* a web service to register a user, their mobile phone number and initial area [to do]
* an SMS service to change the required area and turn messaging on or off
* a scheduled task to push the SMS messages when the new forecast has been obtained

=== Document Structure ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;subscriptions&gt;
  &lt;subscription&gt;
     &lt;username&gt;Fred Bloggs&lt;/username&gt;
     &lt;password&gt;hafjahfjafa&lt;/password&gt;
     &lt;mobilenumber&gt;447777777&lt;/mobilenumber&gt;
     &lt;area&gt;lundy&lt;/area&gt;
     &lt;status&gt;off&lt;/status&gt;
  &lt;/subscription&gt;
  ...
&lt;/subscriptions&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;


==== XML Schema ====

(to be completed)

=== Access control ===
Access to this document needs to be controlled. 

The first level of access control is to place the file in a collection which is not accessible via the web.  In the UWE server, the root (via mod-rewrite) is the collection /db/Wiki so resources in this directory and subdirectories are accessible, subject to the access settings on the file, but files in parent or sibling directories are not. So this document is stored in the directory /db/Wiki2.  The URL of this file, relative to the external root is 
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/../Wiki2/shippingsubscriptions.xml http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/../Wiki2/shippingsubscriptions.xml] but access fails.

The second level of control is to set the owner and permissions on the file.  This is needed because a user on a client behind the firewall, using the internal server address, will gain access to this file.  By default, world permissions are set to read and update. Removing this access requires the script to login to read as group or owner. 
 
Ownership and permissions can be set either via the web client or by functions in the eXist xmldb module.

=== SMS push ===

This function takes a subscription, formulates a text message and calls a general sms:send function to send. This interfaces with our SMS service provider.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:push-sms($subscription as element(subscription))  as element(result) {
  let $area := $subscription/area
  let $forecast := met:get-stored-forecast($area)
  let $time := datetime:format-dateTime($forecast/../@at,&quot;EE HH:mm&quot;)
  let $text := encode-for-uri(concat($area, &quot; &quot;,$time,&quot; &quot;,met:abbreviate(met:forecast-as-text($forecast))))
  let $number := $subscription/mobilenumber
  let $sent := sms:send($number,$text)
  return 
       &lt;result number=&quot;{$number}&quot; area=&quot;{$area}&quot; sent=&quot;{$sent}&quot;/&gt;
};

&lt;/source&gt;

=== SMS push subscriptions ===

First we need to get the active subscriptions. The functions follow the same idiom used for boundaries:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;


declare function met:subscriptions() {
    doc(&quot;/db/Wiki2/shippingsubscriptions.xml&quot;)/subscriptions
};

declare function met:active-subscriptions() as element(subscription) *  {
    met:subscriptions()/subscription[status=&quot;on&quot;]
};

&lt;/source&gt;


and then to iterate through the active subscriptions and report the result:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:push-subscriptions() as element(results) {
&lt;results&gt;
   { 
     let $dummy := xmldb:login(&quot;/db&quot;,&quot;webuser&quot;,&quot;password&quot;)
     for  $subscription in  met:active-subscriptions()
     return     
        met:push-sms($subscription) 
   }
&lt;/results&gt;
};

&lt;/source&gt; 
This script iterates through the subscriptions currently active and calls the push-SMS function for each one.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module  namespace met = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/met&quot; at &quot;met.xqm&quot;;
met:push-subscriptions()
&lt;/source&gt;

This task could be scheduled to run after the caching task has run or the caching script modified to invoke the subscription task when it has completed. However eXist also supports triggers so the task could also be triggered by the database event raised when the forecast file store has been completed.

=== Subscription editing by SMS ===

A message format is required to edit the status of the subscription and to change the subscription area:

  metsub [ on |off |&lt;area&gt; ]

If the area is changed the status is set to on.

The area is validated against a list of area codes. These are extracted from the boundary data:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:area-names() as xs:string* {
   met:area-boundaries()/boundary/string(@area)
};
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

import module namespace met = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/met&quot; at &quot;met.xqm&quot;;
let $login:= xmldb:login(&quot;/db&quot;,&quot;user&quot;,&quot;password&quot;)
let $text := normalize-space(request:get-parameter(&quot;text&quot;,()))
let $number := request:get-parameter(&quot;from&quot;,())
let $subscription := met:get-subscription($number)

return
   if (exists($subscription))
   then       
        let $update :=
           if ( $text= &quot;on&quot;) 
           then update replace $subscription/status with &lt;status&gt;on&lt;/status&gt;
           else if( $text = &quot;off&quot;) 
           then update replace $subscription/status with &lt;status&gt;off&lt;/status&gt;
           else if ( lower-case($text) = met:area-names())
           then ( update replace $subscription/area with &lt;area&gt;{$text}&lt;/area&gt;,
                  update replace $subscription/status with &lt;status&gt;on&lt;/status&gt;
                )
           else ()
       return
         let $subscription := met:get-subscription($number)(: get the subscription post update :)
         return 
             concat(&quot;Reply: forecast is &quot;,$subscription/status,&quot; for area &quot;,$subscription/area)
 else ()
&lt;/source&gt;



=== Twitter ===

[http://twitter.com Twitter] has a simple REST API to update the status.  We can use this to tweet the forecasts to a Twitter account. Twitter uses Basic Access Authentication and a suitable XQuery function to send a message to a username/password, using the eXist httpclient module is :

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function met:send-tweet ($username as xs:string,$password as xs:string,$tweet as xs:string )  as xs:boolean {
   let $uri :=  xs:anyURI(&quot;http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml&quot;)
   let $content :=concat(&quot;status=&quot;, encode-for-uri($tweet))
   let $headers := 
      &lt;headers&gt;
          &lt;header name=&quot;Authorization&quot; 
                  value=&quot;Basic {util:string-to-binary(concat($username,&quot;:&quot;,$password))}&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;header name=&quot;Content-Type&quot;
                  value=&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/headers&gt;
   let $response :=   httpclient:post( $uri, $content, false(), $headers ) 
   return
        $response/@statusCode='200'
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

A script is needed to access the stored forecast and tweet the forecast for an area. Different twitter accounts could be set up for each shipping area.  The script will need to be scheduled to run after the the full forecast has been acquired. 

In this example, the forecast for given are is tweeted to a hard-coded twitterer:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace met = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/met&quot; at &quot;met.xqm&quot;;

declare variable $username := &quot;kitwallace&quot;;
declare variable $password := &quot;mypassword&quot;;
declare variable $area := request:get-parameter(&quot;area&quot;,&quot;lundy&quot;);

let $forecast := met:get-stored-forecast($area)
let $time := datetime:format-dateTime($forecast/../@at,&quot;HH:mm&quot;)
let $message := concat($area,&quot; at &quot;,$time,&quot;:&quot;,met:abbreviate(met:forecast-as-text($forecast)))
return 
    &lt;result&gt;{met:send-tweet($username,$password,$message)}&lt;/result&gt;  
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://twitter.com/kitwallace Chris Wallace's Twitter ]

==To do ==
=== Creating and editing subscriptions ===
This task is ideal for XForms.
=== Triggers ===
Use a trigger to push the SMS messages when update has been done.

== Re: Watching Books ==

This is actually a common request, and one that we should document more. On the main page of your book, look in the lower-left corner of the screen, directly under the search box. There should be a small box with links called the &quot;Toolbox&quot;, which should have a link that says &quot;Related changes&quot;. This link will show you all changes to pages which link to the current page. If you do that on the main TOC of your book, if that TOC contains links to all pages in the book, it should show you a list of all changes to all pages in the book.

Alternatively, you could add all pages in the book to your personal watchlist by clicking the &quot;watch&quot; tab at the top of each page. Then you go to [[Special:Watchlist]], and it shows you changes to all pages you are watching. If you go to the '''Watchlist''' tab at [[Special:Preferences]], you can set some options regarding this, such as automatically watching all pages you edit, or automatically watching all pages you create, etc. This should simplify the process, and will keep your watchlist up-to-date as you create and edit new pages. I hope this helps you. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:10, 7 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Quick Review of nanometals=
Nanometal (also called metal nanoparticles) is very attractive and that is because of their size and shape dependent properties. The optical properties (linear and nonlinear) depend on that and they on dominated by something called the collective oscillation of conduction electrons. There are so many ways that you can prepare metal nanoparticles but the most used methods are based on wet chemistry. You can find nanometal being used in medical applications to the weaponry the military use. Nanometals also have a thing called Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) this is what cause the change in colors that we see. For example in the 4th century when the Lycurgus cup was created. The cup changes red when the light is shone inside of the cup and green when reflective light is shone on the outside of it. There are so many methods that you can prepare nanometals and the most popular way is by reducing HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   (chlorauric acid) in a sodium citrate solution that is boiling and then the formation of gold nanoparticles are revealed by a deep red color that looks like wine in about 10 min.&lt;ref&gt;webs.uvigo.es/coloides/nano&lt;/ref&gt;

=Types of nanometal synthesis=
The most common types of nanometal synthesis deal with 'wet' methods in which metal nanoparticles are produced in a colloid with an organic material of some sort.

Gold nanoparticles can be produced by either:

1) Reduction of HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in a solution of sodium citrate, then boiling it, causing gold nanoparticles to form in a wine-red solution.

2) Mixing HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in water, which produces a solution that is subsequently transferred into toluene using tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB), a phase transfer catalyst. Phase transfer catalysts help reactants dissolve in organic (carbon-containing) material where the reactant otherwise couldn't w/o the PTC. Afterwards, the solution is stirred with sodium borohydride, in the presence of certain alkanes, which bind to the gold in the solution, allowing for the formation of gold nanoparticles.

Synthesis of other metal nanoparticles can possibly be achieved by reducing metal salts in organic solvents such as ethanol, or by variations of the above methods which synthesize gold nanoparticles.

The purpose of this book is to provide practical information to current and prospective [[w:Search_and_rescue_dog|SAR dog]] handlers. Since there are many different approaches to any element of SAR dog training, this book will be most useful if different opinions and approaches are documented simultaneously rather than constantly overwriting each other. If you see an error or have something to add to existing content, do so. If you have an alternative view, add this view rather than deleting existing content.

This book is organized in two ways: by training topic and chronologically. The training topics provide instructions on the training of individual skills the SAR dog needs, including multiple approaches to each skill and step in training. The chronological organization aims to provide what essentially amounts to a blueprint for raising and training a SAR dog, beginning at birth through certification and retirement. This blueprint must obviously be adapted to each training/dog team and represents a &quot;best case scenario&quot;.

Hi, my real-name is Tom Tarrant and I'm a keen wildlife/video-photographer in my spare-time (which is sadly far too-short!). Recently I've been adding images to bird articles on Wikipedia and felt that it would be nice to create some material in print to promote and educate wildlife-conservation. To my mind the natural-world is priceless and I would rather put my efforts into a non-profit publications, I am becoming very-comfortable with open-source computing and enjoying using Ubuntu, Firefox, Gimp, Kino and all the community-based software,
Would be extremely grateful for any tips and advice from other wikibook enthusiasts!

      <comment>/* Superlativo relativo */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In English, the comparative and the superlative can be created both by adding the modifiers ''more, less, most, least'' or by adding the suffixes ''-er, -est''. In Italian, since suffixes of the kind are not added to regular adverbs and adjectives, the only way to create comparatives and superlatives is to add modifiers like ''più'' or ''meno'' (equivalent to more,less...).

Along with articles, adjectives must have the same gender and number of the referred noun.


==Comparatives / comparative==
===Basic structure:===
...Più/meno + adjective/adverb(or noun) + di/che... &lt;br&gt;

'''Examples'''

 Marco è '''più alto''' di Luca              (''Marco is '''taller''' than Luca'')
 Marco corre '''più velocemente''' di Luca   (''Marco runs '''faster''' than Luca'')
 Pescare è '''meno faticoso''' che nuotare   (''Fishing is '''less tiring''' than swimming'')
 Quell'albero ha '''meno''' di 100 anni      (Literary: ''That tree has '''less''' than 100 years'')

===DI or CHE===
The word ''than'' can be translated with both ''di'' and ''che''. There are some rules that determine which is to be used.

;''Che'' is to be used when comparing two
:*adjectives referred to a person or thing
:*infinitives 
:*participles
:*nouns referred to a person or thing
:*nouns or pronouns preceded by a preposition
'''Examples'''
 L'acqua è più rinfrescante&lt;sub&gt;adj&lt;/sub&gt; '''che''' saporita&lt;sub&gt;adj&lt;/sub&gt;   (''Water is more refreshing '''than''' tasty'')
 Pescare&lt;sub&gt;inf&lt;/sub&gt; è più rilassante '''che''' nuotare&lt;sub&gt;inf&lt;/sub&gt;      (''Fishing is more relaxing '''than''' swimming)
 Ora ho meno sete&lt;sub&gt;noun&lt;/sub&gt; '''che''' fame&lt;sub&gt;noun&lt;/sub&gt;               (Literally: ''Right now I have less thirst '''than''' hunger'')
 Mi sono divertito di più a&lt;sub&gt;prep&lt;/sub&gt; Milano '''che''' a&lt;sub&gt;prep&lt;/sub&gt; Roma      (''I had a better time in Milan '''than''' in Rome'')

;''Di'' is to be used when Che is not compulsory, such as:
:*when followed by a number
:*when comparing two objects A&amp;B using the structure: ''[A] + verb + più/meno + adj/adv(or noun) + DI + [B]''
:*when using the words &quot;più/meno ''di quanto'' + verb&quot; or &quot;più/meno ''di quel che'' + verb&quot;
:*when comparing two improper nouns (the 'di' then articulates)
'''Examples'''
 Quell' albero ha meno '''di''' 100 anni           (''that tree is less than 100 years old'')
 Marco&lt;sub&gt;[A]&lt;/sub&gt; è più alto '''di''' Luca&lt;sub&gt;[B]&lt;/sub&gt;  (''Marco is taller than Luca'')
 Luca è meno alto '''di quanto''' pensassi         (Literally: ''Luca is less tall '''than''' I thought'')
 Marco è più alto '''di quel che''' ricordavo      (''Marco is taller '''than''' I remembered'')
 La macchina è meno cara della casa                (''The car is less expensive than the house'')

==Superlatives / Superlativi==
In Italian, as in most romance languages, the elative and superlative forms are joined in the ''Superlativo'', which can be of two kinds: ''Superlativo relativo'' (comparative) or ''Superlativo assoluto'' (absolute).

===Superlativo relativo===
It represents a general quality that, even if expressed at its highest level, is still compared with that of other objects (more than 2). It is formed simply by using ''più'' or ''meno'' between the determinative article and the adjective.&lt;br&gt;
'''Examples'''
 Marco è '''il più alto''' di loro                       (''Marco is '''the tallest''' of them'')
 Marco è '''il più alto''' tra loro                      (''Marco is '''the tallest''' among them'')
 (Loro) sono '''le meno chiaccherone''' della classe     (''They are '''the least talkative''' in the class'')

===Superlativo assoluto===
It represents a general quality at its maximum level (like the elative). Normally, it is formed by adding the suffix ''-issimo'' to the adjective's ending. The end of the suffix indicates the gender and number of the noun it refers to, therefore:
*''-issimo''    masculine, singular
*''-issimi''    masculine, plural
*''-issima''    feminine, singular
*''-issime''    feminine, plural

'''Examples'''
 Marco è '''altissimo'''              (''Marco is '''very tall''''')
 Quell'aereo è '''velocissimo'''      (''That plane is '''very fast''''')
 (Tu) sei '''molto carina'''           (Literally: ''You are '''very nice''''')

Another way to form the absolute superlative is to put words such as ''molto, tanto...'' (very, much...) before the adjective.

==Irregular forms==
There are some adjectives/adverbs that have their own form of superlative and ''comparativo di maggioranza'' (comparative using ''più'' and not ''meno''):

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Positive
! Comparativo di maggioranza
! Absolute superlative
|-
| Buono ''good''
| Migliore ''better''
| Ottimo ''best''
|-
|Cattivo ''bad''
|Peggiore ''worse''
|Pessimo ''worst''
|-
|Grande ''big''
|Maggiore ''bigger''
|Massimo ''biggest''
|-
|Piccolo ''small''
|Minore ''smaller''
|Minimo ''smallest''
|-
|Alto ''tall''
|Superiore ''taller''
|Sommo ''tallest''
|-
|Basso ''low''
|Inferiore ''lower''
|Infimo ''lowest''
|-
|Bene (adv) ''well''
|Meglio (adv) ''better''
|Benissimo (adv) ''very well''
|-
|Male (adv) ''badly''
|Peggio (adv) ''worse''
|Malissimo (adv) ''very badly''
|-
|}
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow&quot;&gt;Even if an irregular form is present, most of these adjectives can be used with their regular one.&lt;/span&gt; As a matter of fact, you will never hear an Italian addressing to Marco and say: &quot;Marco è sommo&quot;.


There are also words deriving from Latin terms ending with &quot;-er&quot;, which kept a superlative form similar to the old Latin one. The most &quot;common&quot; are:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Positive
! Absolute Superlative
|-
|Acre (''acrid'')
|Acerrimo
|-
|Misero (''poor'')
|Miserrimo
|-
|Integro (''integral'')
|Integerrimo
|-
|Celebre (''renowned'')
|Celeberrimo
|-
|Salubre (''healthy'')
|Saluberrimo
|-
|Tetro (''gloomy'')
|Teterrimo
|-
|Benefico (''beneficent'')
|Beneficentissimo
|-
|Magnifico (''magnificent'')
|Magnificentissimo
|-

Hi Aviceda,

I'm very excited that someone else is coming along to work on the FG's.  Any images that are on the Commons are directly usable here.  It's as if they already were here in fact.  Articles on Wikipedia are also usable here, but it's a little more tricky.  There are two approaches. The first is to request an import by leaving a message on [[Wikibooks:Requests for Import]], and an administrator will import the text from WP to WB.  You could also leave a request on my talk page, but it's better to ask where other admins can see the request.  If you wish to import only a couple of sentences, you can cut and paste and then leave a link in the summary field, such as &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;import text from [[w:some bird]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;.  Importing is better, but if you cannot wait, the second method will do the trick too.

If you find range maps (etc) on WP that are not on the Commons, you can transfer them.  This is a mosty manual process though, and if you need info on that, just ask.

My work on the FG started out when I was putting [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Birds]] together.  I realized after a while that it would be better to collect the info into a FG, so I started on that.  I still need to move several of the pages, as they are still under the old name.  We are also exploring options for improving [[:Template:Bird id]]. So if you have any ideas on that, please do not hesitate to share them on the template's talk page.

Thanks for your interest! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:06, 7 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Lesson 2 - '''''Greetings and other basics''''' ==
Now, when you know exactly [[Silesian/Lesson 1|how to read in Silesian]], you are ready to learn the basics. Each time you meet someone, it's necessary to greet him/her! And when you do that in Silesian instead of Polish, people love you! So, let's start with the basic dialogs - in the first one two good friends are meeting. In the second one - a man greets an elderly lady.

Note: Read both dialogs and then the vocabulary. There's also the translation, which is available when you click the title of the dialog, but try not to use it.

'''Jůn:''' Witej, Pyjter!
&lt;br&gt;'''Pyjter:''' O, witej, Jůn! Jak ći śe daři?
&lt;br&gt;'''Jůn:''' Jako tam, dźynki. Třim śe!
&lt;br&gt;'''Pyjter:''' Pyrsk!
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;'''Půn Klučńok:''' Dobře, dźynkuja. Do widzyńo!

== Grammar ==
Today we are not going to actually analyze the grammar in Silesian. This lesson is for you to see how the Silesian looks and how it sounds.
=== Nominative vs. vocative ===
As you see in the dialogs, in Silesian we use different cases. The basic case is nominative and it appears also in English in ''bank'', ''pencil'', ''tree'' and so on. When we address someone in Silesian, we usually change the form of a name (you won't learn how to do this yet). You would say ''This is '''Půn Jůn''''' (lit. Mr. John). But if this is a person you're talking with, you say eg. '''Půńe Jůńe, jak śe wům daři?''' (Mr. John, how are you?). Some words are the same in nominative and vocative, eg. '''půńi'''.

==Safety in the Digital Age==

When teaching about information literacy in the digital age it is imperative that parents and teachers teach students how to stay safe when using technology. Dangers that range from spam and spyware to online predators should be identified and methods to protect yourself should be outlined for students so they can make use of the wealth of information and technology available in a safe manner.

==Possible Student Dangers:==


* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic) Spam] : Spam is large amounts of messages sent to people who did not choose to receive them. Spam messages can include advertisements for questionable products and services, pornographic images, scams offering to help the receiver “get rich quick” or viruses and Trojan horses. To avoid spam try to not to give out your e-mail address to often. Often companies will sell your information to others. This can result in large amounts of unwanted e-mail.(Muller, 2008)

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus Viruses]: Viruses are pieces of computer code which attach themselves to computer programs. When the program is run the virus becomes embedded in the computer's memory. The virus can then cause damage to software of files on the computer.

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_%28computing%29 Trojan Horses] : Trojan horses appear to be useful software. However, once they are downloaded they can damage your software or files and/or send sensitive information (like usernames and passwords) back to someone else. 

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware Spyware] : Software that tracks your movements on the Internet, collects personal information or targets advertising to you. (What is Spyware?, 2008)

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberstalking Cyberharrasment/ cyberstalking] : When an adult harasses, threatens, humiliates or targets a child or another adult on line. This can occur through e-mails, instant messages, posts on discussion boards, text messages etc. (Stop Cyberbullying 2008)

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying Cyberbullying] : When minor harasses, threatens, humiliates or targets another child on line.

* On line predators: Predators may attempt to lure children into dangerous or sexual situations through contacting them on the Internet. This can happen through chat rooms, instant messaging, e-mails, or other communication.

(Stop Cyberbullying 2008)

==Guidelines for Avoiding Danger:== 

* Never give out personal information on the Internet
* Do not open e-mails, files or attachments from people you do not know
* Do not tell your password to anyone except your parents
* If anything makes you uncomfortable tell an adult immediately
(Canada Safety Council 2008)

==Tips for Parents and Teachers:==
*Keep the computer in a central location so you can monitor activity
*Possibly share an e-mail account with your child so you can monitor communication
*Check with your Internet service provider to see if they offer any services that can restrict access to certain sites for your child
*Look into software that filters on line content
*Teachers--make sure safety is part of your lesson plan. Make sure students are aware of any safety before using new technology. Here are some ideas for integrating internet safety into the classroom: [http://www.education-world.com/a_tech/tech043.shtml EducationWorld]
*Most importantly—talk to your children about safety. Make sure they know they can come to you if they are having problems or feel uncomfortable

      <comment>/* Sample Input XML Document */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a single large XML document with many consistent records in it.  You want to split it into many smaller documents so that each can be edited by a separate user.  There are many good reasons to split large files up.  Some have to do with how much data you want to load into an editor at a time or how you want to publish individual files to a remote site.

eXist and many other systems do versioning and keep date/time stamps for each file.  Using smaller files these functions may be easier to do.

== Method ==
We will create an XQuery that will iterate through all the records in the document.  For each record we will use the XQuery function to store a document in a collection.  The format of this function is:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;
xmldb:store($collection, $filename, $data)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Where:
* '''$collection''' is a string that holds the path to the collection we will be storing the data for each record.  For example '/db/test/data'
* '''$filename''' is the name of the file.  The name can either be derived from the data or it can be generated by a sequence counter in the split query.  For example 'Hello.xml&quot; or &quot;1.xml&quot;.
* '''$data''' is the data we will be storing into the file

== Sample Input XML Document ==
One way to get started is to put your data such as business terms into a spreadsheet and convert it to XML.  The oXygen XML editor has some very good tools for converting spreadsheets to XML format.  Make sure you put &quot;Term&quot; and &quot;Definition&quot; in the first row and use this row to define the element names.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;root&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
      &lt;Term&gt;Hi&lt;/Term&gt;
      &lt;Definition&gt;An informal short greeting.&lt;/Definition&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
      &lt;Term&gt;Hello&lt;/Term&gt;
      &lt;Definition&gt;A more formal greeting.&lt;/Definition&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample XQuery ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

let $input-document := '/db/test/input.xml'
let $collection := '/db/test/terms'

(: the login used must have write access to the collection :)
let $output-collection := xmldb:login($collection, 'my-login', 'my-password')

return
&lt;SplitResults&gt;{
     for $term-data in doc($input-document)/root/row
        (: For brevity we will create a file name with the term name.  Change this to be an ID function if you want :)
        let $term-name := $term-data/Term/text()
        let $documentname := concat($term-name, '.xml')
        let $store-return := xmldb:store($collection, $documentname, $term-data)
     return
        &lt;store-result&gt;
           &lt;store&gt;{$term-name}&lt;/store&gt;
           &lt;documentname&gt;{$documentname}&lt;/documentname&gt;
        &lt;/store-result&gt;
}&lt;/SplitResults&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Using A Sequence Counter for Artificial Keys ==
Sometimes there are not any elements in the importing record that can be used as a unique key or are not appropriate to use as an artificial key.  In this case you will want to use a counter to create an XML document with a unique number in it.  The sequence number generated is called an &quot;artificial key&quot; since it is not really related directly to any data elements in the record.

You can achieve this by adding an &quot;at counter&quot; to your for loop.  To do this just add the string &lt;b&gt;at $count&lt;/b&gt; after the for variable like the following

&lt;code&gt;
for $term-data &lt;b&gt;at $count&lt;/b&gt; in $input-file/row
&lt;/code&gt;

The store function can then use the $count variable to create a file name with this number:

&lt;code&gt;
let $filename := concat($count, '.xml')
&lt;/code&gt;

== Adding a ID to each item using the XQuery update Operator ==

Once you have inserted the data into a collection you will then want to assign each item a unique ID.  This is called an ''artificial key'' since it is created by an artifical import process and it not related to data inside of the item.  Artificial keys are usually assigned by the computer system that stores the data but not derived from the data.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;item&gt;
   &lt;person-name&gt;John Doe&lt;/person-name&gt;
   ...
&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also automatically add an ID to each item by doing the following:

   for $item at $count in $items
   return
      update insert &lt;id&gt;{$count}&lt;/id&gt; preceding $item/person-name

After this update the new ID element will be inserted before the person-name element:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;item&gt;
   &lt;id&gt;47&lt;/id&gt;
   &lt;person-name&gt;John Doe&lt;/person-name&gt;
   ...
&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

It is a best practice to make sure that items do not already have an ID element.

   for $item at $count in $items[not(id)]
   return
      update insert &lt;id&gt;{$count}&lt;/id&gt; preceding $item/person-name

This prevents duplicate ids from being added if the script gets run twice.  You can also modify this to start the count one higher then the largest id in a collection.

   (: get the largest ID in the collection :)
   let $largest-id := max(  collection($my-collection)/*/id/text() )
   let $offset := $largest-id + 1
   for $item at $count in $items[not(id)]
   return
      update insert &lt;id&gt;{$count + $offset}&lt;/id&gt; preceding $item/person-name

The split pattern is documented in the 
[http://www.eaipatterns.com/Sequencer.html Enterprise Pattern Integration] Web site.  Note that pattern is called &quot;Splitter&quot; dispite the fact that the name in the URL is &quot;Sequencer&quot;.

Also note that the size of the file you select to load into the client has a large impact on the way that concurrent edits are performed.  This has a large impact on what data needs to be locked for editing.  See
[http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2008/05/xrx_locking_grain_design.html XRX Locking Grain Design] for more information.

This book is intended for students of mathematics making their first forays in rigorous mathematics. This usually happens in the transition from calculus (usually involving mostly the 'mechanical' application of the rules of differentiation and integration), to (real) analysis which involves ''proving'' more general statements and usually requires a bit more lateral thinking than introductory calculus.

      <comment>/* Notation */ repeated paragraph</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">To study mathematics rigorously some key concepts must be understood. The most important of these is by far the groundwork which is laid down by basic ''logic''. All rigorous mathematical arguments rely on this groundwork and it is therefore essential to understand and become familiar with basic logic. Second to this, is understanding ''mathematical objects'' (or just 'objects') - their definition and how they ultimately relate to other objects through logical statements. Thirdly it is important to understand the role and meaning of ''notation'' in writing rigorous mathematics unambiguously. 

These three concepts seamlessly intertwine and any deficiency in one will certainly hamper the others.

== Some initial definitions == 

Our initial definitions will mostly be intuitive rather than rigorous. More rigorous definitions form part of theories that are subjects of study on their own and the reader is encouraged to look at the formal definitions, but these are outside the scope of this text.

We will call a logical '''statement''' any (mathematical) statement that is either unambiguously true or unambiguously false. For example, &quot;3 is less than 4&quot; is a true logical statement, &quot;9 is an even number&quot; is a false logical statement, and &quot;this statement is false&quot; is ''not'' a logical statement. 

Every statement has a '''negation'''. If a statement is true(false), its negation is false(true).

We define the word '''set''' to mean &quot;a collection of distinct 'mathematical objects'&quot; (the term 'mathematical objects' we leave undefined, but can be thought of any object that can be described mathematically). We say an object is an '''element''' of a set that contains it.

We define the word '''function''' to mean: &quot;a rule of associating every element contained in a set, called the '''domain''', unambiguously to exactly one element in another set, called the '''codomain'''&quot;

== Notation ==

The symbol &quot;:=&quot; is defined to read &quot;equal by definition&quot;, and is used to define letters or symbols used to refer to commonly occurring objects. Statements involving the symbol &quot;:=&quot; are always assumed to be true. There is a subtle, but important difference between the symbols &quot;:=&quot; and &quot;=&quot;. For example, we may first write &quot;a:=4&quot;. This defines the symbol 'a' to equal 4, which is then assumed to be true. Then &quot;a=5&quot; and &quot;a=4&quot; are statements, the first of which is false and the second true.

Statements are often referred to by the letters &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. 

Sets are often referred to by the capital letters &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. If we want to show that a collection of objects form a set we will use curly braces to denote it. For example, &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set containing 1,2,3 and 4. 

We define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;&quot; to mean: &quot;is an element of&quot;. So, &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt; reads &quot;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an element of (the set) &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, and is a logical statement. So, for example &lt;math&gt;1\in\{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt; is a true statement and &lt;math&gt;5\in\{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt; is false.

Functions are often referred to by the letters &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. If the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the domain, and the set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the codomain of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; we write &lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; which reads &quot;&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; maps (the set) &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; into (the set) &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. If &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt; we will use the notation &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; to refer to the element in the codomain &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which is associated to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; through the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

Often a word in a statement is replaceable. When this is a case &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is called a predicate. For example, we can define symbol &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; to mean &quot;x is an odd number&quot;. Then &lt;math&gt;P(2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(5)&lt;/math&gt; are statements, the first of which is false and the second true. 

We will only intuitively define the notion of a '''set''' as a collection of distinct mathematical objects called the '''elements''' of the set. Standard notation for writing sets are 'curly braces'. For example, we write &lt;math&gt;A:=\{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt;, which means that 'A', by definition, refers to the set containing the elements '1', '2', '3' and '4'. We define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;&quot; to read &quot;is an element of&quot;. Then &quot;&lt;math&gt;1\in A&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;math&gt;5\in A&lt;/math&gt;&quot; are statements, the first of which is true and the second false.

Sets can contain an infinite number of objects and can even contain sets themselves. Some of the most often used infinite sets are &quot;the natural numbers&quot; denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, &quot;the rational numbers&quot; denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, and &quot;the real numbers&quot; denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Sets can also be defined be logical statements. The notation &quot;&lt;math&gt;\{x | P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is defined to read &quot;the set of all objects, x, such that P(x) is a true statement&quot;. For example, if as before, &lt;math&gt;P(x):=&lt;/math&gt;&quot;x is an odd number&quot;, then &lt;math&gt;\{x | P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of ''all'' odd numbers. Then also, the statement &quot;&lt;math&gt;1234\in \{x | P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is false and the statement &quot;&lt;math&gt;1233\in \{x | P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is true.

Where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is any set, sometimes the notation &quot;&lt;math&gt;\{x\in A | P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is also used and means &quot;the set all elements, x, in set A such that P(x) is true&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the previous chapter we made clear what a logical statement is. In this chapter we will define and derive rules for working with compound logical statements. The symbols used to combining statements are called &quot;logical operators&quot;.

In this section the symbols &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; denote any logical statements.

= Logical operators and Truth Tables =

Truth tables are used in two ways. Firstly to define exactly what a certain compounded statement means, and secondly to derive the properties of more complicated compounded statements. Truth tables exhaust all possible combinations of the truth of falsehood of the constituent statements in the compounded statement to yield exactly under what combinations of truth and falsehood of the constituent statements, the compound statement is true or false.

== Definitions ==

=== Not, Negation ===
We define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;&quot; to mean &quot;not&quot;. If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a statement then &lt;math&gt;\lnot P&lt;/math&gt; is also a statement.  It inverts the truth or falsehood of logical statements. In other words, if the statement &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, then the statement &lt;math&gt;\lnot P&lt;/math&gt; is false and if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, then &lt;math&gt;\lnot P&lt;/math&gt; is true. We call &lt;math&gt;\lnot P&lt;/math&gt; the negation of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

We rigorously define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;&quot; by the following truth table

{| border=1 align=center
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;
|---- align=center
|T
|F
|---- align=center
|F
|T
|}

Even though &quot;not&quot; simplest logical operator, the negation of statements is important when trying to prove that certain objects have or do not have certain properties. It makes the skill of being able to correctly negate statements an important one.

=== And, Conjunction ===
We define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;&quot; to mean &quot;and&quot;. If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are statements then &lt;math&gt;P\land Q&lt;/math&gt; is also a statement, is called the '''conjunction''' of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, and it reads &quot;&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; AND &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. The compound statement &lt;math&gt;P\land Q&lt;/math&gt; is true only when ''both statements'' &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are true.

We rigorously define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;&quot; by the following truth table

{| border=1 align=center
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;P\land Q&lt;/math&gt;

|T
|---- align=center

|F

|T
|F
|---- align=center

|}


=== Or, Disjunction ===
We define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;&quot; to mean &quot;or&quot;. If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are statements then &lt;math&gt;P\lor Q&lt;/math&gt; is also a statement, is called the '''disjunction''' of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, and it reads &quot;&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; OR &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. The compound statement &lt;math&gt;P\lor Q&lt;/math&gt; is true only when ''either''  &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; ''or both statements''  &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are true.

We rigorously define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;&quot; by the following truth table

{| border=1 align=center
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;P\lor Q&lt;/math&gt;

|}

=== If ... then, Implication ===
We define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&quot; to mean &quot;implies&quot;. If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are statements then &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is also a statement and it reads &quot;&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; IMPLIES &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;&quot; or also &quot;IF &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; THEN &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. The compound statement &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is false only when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is false. We call &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; the '''hypothesis''' and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; the '''Conclusion''' of the implication.

We rigorously define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&quot; by the following truth table

{| border=1 align=center
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;

|T
|---- align=center
|T
|F
|F
|---- align=center
|F
|T
|T
|---- align=center
|F
|F
|T
|}

We call the statement &quot;&lt;math&gt;Q\Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;&quot; the '''converse''' of &quot;&lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

Logical implication plays an important role since most theorems take on the form of an implication.

=== If and only if, Equivalence ===
We define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&quot; to mean &quot;if and only if&quot;. If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are statements then &lt;math&gt;P\Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is also a statement and it reads &quot;&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true if and only if &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is true&quot;. 

We rigorously define the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&quot; by the following truth table

{| border=1 align=center
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;P\Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;

== Basic results ==
In this section we will prove some basic equivalences for compounded logical statements. We say that two (compound) statements are '''logically equivalent''' when written in the same truth table, their columns are identical. Knowing how to write statements into logically equivalent statements is very useful in the sense that a statement might be difficult to prove, yet a logically equivalent statement might be easier to prove.

=== Lemma 1 (DeMorgan's law, part 1) ===

&lt;math&gt;\lnot(P\land Q)&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lnot P \lor \lnot Q&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof'''

{| border=1 align=center
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;

!width=50|&lt;math&gt;P\land Q&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;\lnot(P\land Q)&lt;/math&gt;

!width=50|&lt;math&gt;\lnot P&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;\lnot Q&lt;/math&gt;
!width=50|&lt;math&gt;\lnot P \lor \lnot Q&lt;/math&gt;

Since the columns for the compound statements are identical, they are logically equivalent. QED

Proving the following theorems are left as exercises.
=== Lemma 2 (DeMorgan's law, part 2) ===
&lt;math&gt;\lnot(P\lor Q)&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lnot P \land \lnot Q&lt;/math&gt;
=== Lemma 3 ===
&lt;math&gt;P\Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(P\Rightarrow Q)\land(Q\Rightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;
=== Lemma 4 ===
&lt;math&gt;\lnot(P\Rightarrow Q)&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;P\land(\lnot Q)&lt;/math&gt;
=== Lemma 5 ===
&lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lnot P\lor Q&lt;/math&gt;
=== Lemma 6 (Contrapositive) ===
&lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lnot Q \Rightarrow \lnot P&lt;/math&gt;

=== Lemma 7 ===
&lt;math&gt;P\Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lnot P \Leftrightarrow \lnot Q&lt;/math&gt;

A '''predicate''' is defined to be a function mapping any set into the set &lt;math&gt;\{T,F\}&lt;/math&gt; where the symbols &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; mean 'true' and 'false' respectively. A predicate can be thought of a collection of statements, one for each element of the domain of the predicate.

For example, we may define the predicate &lt;math&gt;P:\mathbb{Z}\to \{T,F\}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;P(x):=&lt;/math&gt;&quot;x is an even integer&quot;. Instead of writing &quot;&lt;math&gt;P(5)=F&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;math&gt;P(16)=T&lt;/math&gt;&quot; we will say and write &quot;&lt;math&gt;P(5)&lt;/math&gt; is false&quot; and &quot;&lt;math&gt;P(16)&lt;/math&gt; is true&quot;.

If &lt;math&gt;P:A\to \{T,F\}&lt;/math&gt; is a predicate, then the predicate &lt;math&gt;\lnot P:A\to \{T,F\}&lt;/math&gt; defined to be such that &lt;math&gt;\lnot P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true exactly when &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is false and &lt;math&gt;\lnot P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is false exactly when &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true, is called the '''negation''' of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

There are two '''quantifiers''' denoted by the symbols &quot;&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;&quot; which read &quot;for all&quot; and &quot;there exists&quot; respectively. 

Let &lt;math&gt;P:A\to \{T,F\}&lt;/math&gt; be a predicate and let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be any subset of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (subsets are discussed in the next section). Then &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in B:P(x)&lt;/math&gt; which reads &quot;For all elements &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contained in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, P(x) is true.&quot; is a statement, and is defined to be true exactly when &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true for every element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contained in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\exists x\in B:P(x)&lt;/math&gt; which reads &quot;There exists an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contained in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; such that P(x) is true.&quot; is a statement, and is defined to be true exactly when &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true for at least one element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contained in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

We define the negation of statements involving quantifiers as follows &lt;math&gt;\lnot(\forall x\in B:P(x)):=\exists x\in B:\lnot P(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot(\exists x\in B:P(x)):=\forall x\in B:\lnot P(x)&lt;/math&gt;

= Logical rules of inferrence =

Proving the truth of statements require knowledge of standard valid logical rules of inference, the most important of which are:

== Adjunction ==
If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are both true then so is &lt;math&gt;P\land Q&lt;/math&gt;

== Simplification ==
If &lt;math&gt;P\land Q&lt;/math&gt; is true then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true.

If &lt;math&gt;P\land Q&lt;/math&gt; is true then &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is true.

== Addition ==
If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true then &lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt; is true (regardless of the truth or falsehood of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;).

== Disjunctive syllogism ==
If &lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt; is true, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false then &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is true.

If &lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt; is true, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is false then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true.

== Modus Ponens ==
If &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is true, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, then &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is true.

== Modus Tollens ==
If &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is true, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is false, then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false.



In a mathematical proof, these rules are usually not explicitly mentioned as they have become second nature to mature students and authors of mathematics. We will be very explicit and pedantic in the proofs of some results in the following chapters, so will mention them.

&lt;!--
== The use of logic in proving mathematical statements ==

Theorems in rigorous mathematics often take on the form of implications or equivalences, therefore it is important to know how to go about prove such statements. 

=== Implications ===
Looking at the truth table for implications we see that &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is always true when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false. When &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is true, only when &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is true and false otherwise. Therefore, proving an implication we only need to prove (by using the above rules of logical inferrence) that &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is true when we assume &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to be true. 

Beginning a proof an implication &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, we will always write &quot;'''Let''' &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be true.&quot; or just &quot;'''Let''' &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, and then use the above rules of inference to derive &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

Often, conjunctions occur in the hypothesis of an implication when the truth of two or more statements imply the truth of the conclusion. Disjunctions sometimes occur in in the conclusion of implications as in the Fredholm alternative.

=== Equivalence ===
As we have shown above, the equivalence &lt;math&gt;P\Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(P\Rightarrow Q)\land(Q\Rightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;, so proving that both implications, &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q\Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;, are true (as explained in the previous paragraph) is sufficient to assert the truth of &lt;math&gt;P\Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; (by adjunction). 

Writing the proof of an equivalence is always done in two parts. We will write &quot;We first prove &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and then proceed to prove the statement, after which we write &quot;Conversely, we now prove &lt;math&gt;Q\Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and then prove that statements.

Often one of the constituent implications of the equivalence is trivial, while the other is not.

=== Proof by contradiction (Reductio ad absurdum) ===
Proof by contradiction is a very important method of proof. Proving, by contradiction, that a statement &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, we will assume that it is false and then derive by the above rules of logical inference the truth of a statement which is clearly false. Since we assert consistency - that statements can only be either true or false - there must be a problem with our argument. This problem is the assumption that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, therefore &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must be true.

To begin a proof by contradiction we will write &quot;We will prove that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true. '''Suppose''', to the contrary that &lt;math&gt;\lnot P&lt;/math&gt; is true&quot;. Then by logical inference and the assumption we derive the truth of a statement &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; which will clearly be false, at which point we will write &quot;But &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is in contradiction with &lt;math&gt;\lnot Q&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must be true.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chris Bergmann Auran:

&quot;A decent rule of thumb might be that each lod should shave off at least 50% of the polygon detail, and that LODs below ~500 polys are not worthwhile unless you expect the item to be static and present numerous times in the same scene. (For example, a tree or generic house.)

More LODs means more memory usage and more CPU/GPU time in order to swap the LODs in and out as appropriate. You want to make sure that the time and memory lost in LOD swapping is more than compensated for in the polygon savings. Small polygon gains just don't make sense in this light.&quot;

*PMID 15936547 -- '''Intraoperative validation of CT-based lymph nodal levels, sublevels IIa and IIb: Is it of clinical relevance in selective radiation therapy?''' (Levendag P, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; &quot;The cranial border of the neck, i.e., the cranial border of level IIa/IIb, corresponds to the caudal edge of the lateral process of C-I. Except for the posterior border between level IIa and level IIb, a perfect match was observed between the other surgical-clip-identified levels II-V boundaries (surgical-anatomy) and the CT-based delineation contours. It is argued that (1) because of the parotid gland overlapping part of level II, and (2) the frequent infestation of occult metastatic cells in the lymph channels around the IJV, the division of level II into radiologic sublevels IIa and IIb may not be relevant. Sparing of, for example, the ipsilateral parotid gland in selective RT can even be a treacherous undertaking with respect to regional tumor control. In contrast, the surgeon's reasoning for preserving the surgical sublevel IIb is that the morbidity associated with dissection of the supraspinal accessory nerve compartment of level II is reduced, whereas there is evidence from the surgical literature that no extra risk for regional tumor control is observed. Therefore, in selective neck dissections, the division into surgical sublevels IIa/IIb makes sense.&quot;

**133 pts. Parotid-sparing RT, primary RT in 60, post-op RT in 73. 115 N+. All pts received bilateral neck RT. For the contralateral neck, the upper boundary of the neck CTV was intended to cover the subdigastric (jugulodigastric) LN; was defined at the CT slice where the posterior belly of the digastric muscle crossed the jugular vein (approx 1-1.5 cm above SD LN) -- this excludes the top of level II, specifically excluding most of IIB. In the ipsilateral neck, the CTV was delineated to the skull base. RP nodes (medial) contoured to the top of C1. Treatment was given using 3D-CRT or IMRT, using parotid-sparing techniques. 
**Analyzed location of tumor recurrence as infield, marginal, or outside. Median f/u 32 mo. 21 pts (16%) had LRR. Most likely recurrence was level II bilaterally (all were in-field). No recurrences were in contralateral neck above the subdigastric nodes. 3 recurrences in RP nodes above C1.
**Conclusions: contralateral, node-negative neck volume should extend superiorly to the subdigastric node. When RP nodes are at risk, they should be covered bilaterally to the skull base.

**Purpose: to assess long-term xerostomia in pts receiving parotid-sparing RT and to find factors that affect its severity.
**132 pts. One group of pts (n=84) received bilateral neck RT with a parotid-sparing technique (IMRT after 1996; modified 3-field technique with beam's eye view before 1996). Another group (controls; n=48) had smaller lateralized tumors and received RT only to the unilateral neck. Used self-reported questionnaires as well as measurements of salivary flow, unstimulated and stimulated, from each parotid duct orifice as well as for the submandibular and sublingual glands collectively. Contoured &quot;oral cavity&quot; to represent dose to the minor salivary glands.
**''Dosimetry:'' Mean dose to contralateral (spared) parotid was 21.9 Gy for the bilateral RT group vs 4.1 Gy for unilateral RT. Contralateral submandibular gland could be spared with UNI RT (14.7 Gy) but not with BIL RT. Unilateral parotid could not be spared with either technique. ''Sialometry:'' contralateral parotid flow was decreased for BIL RT post-RT but rose steadily, approaching pre-RT levels by 12 mos; for UNI RT, no decrease post-RT, then rose to a higher level (to compensate). No output for unilateral irradiated parotid. Submandibular gland flow remained low in the BIL RT group.
**Conclusion: parotid sparing leads to an improvement in xerostomia over time. The uninvolved oral cavity should also be spared in order to reduce xerostomia (reflecting minor salivary gland contribution).

**Retrospective. 103 patients with T1-T2 clinically N+ oropharyngeal CA, who underwent neck dissection (radical LND 15%, modified radical LND 71%, selective LND 14%). 
**Outcome: Positive Level IB 9%, Level II 91%, Level III 41%, Level IV 18%, and Level V 3%. If CT (-), then positive Level IB 3%, Level II 76%, Level III 17%, Level IV 6%, and Level V 1%. Can contour Level IB only posterior half
**Conclusion: Levels II and III should be included in high risk volumes regardless of imaging, Level IV should be low risk; Levels IB and V at very low risk and could be excluded from RT

**Treatment planning. 8 patients. Comparison of IMRT and standard 3-field technique for &quot;medium larynx&quot;, &quot;big larynx&quot;, and &quot;tonsil&quot;
**Conclusion: Dose-volume objectives of IMRT not consistent for some volumes with traditional 3F technique

Hi,everybody, best wisher for you! There is some information about 5082-5553-GI000 ,to share whit you .

http://www.chinaicmart.com/series-508/5082-5553-GI000.html

These low current seven segmen displays are designed for applica
tions requiring low power consumption. They are tested an selected for their excellent low current characteristics to ensure that the segments are matched a low currents. Drive currents as low as 1 mA per segment are available. Pin for pin equivalent displays are also available in a standard current or high light ambient design. The standard current displays are available in all color and are ideal for most applications. The high light ambient displays are ideal for sunlight ambients or long string lengths. For additional information see the 7.6 mm Micro Bright Seven Segment Displays, 10 mm Seven Segment Displays, 7.6 mm/10.9 mm Seven Segment Displays, 14.2 mm Seven Segment Displays, 20 mm Seven Segment Displays, or High Light Ambient Seven Segment Displays data sheets.
Thanks!

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:U660.jpg|frame|right|A German U-Boat about to submerge.]]
'''Submarines''' are ships designed to travel underwater, and remain there for an extended amount of time. Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. Back then they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range. In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen. German submarines were called U-Boats. The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines. Because of their success with submarines, after the war Germans aren't trusted to have many of them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Battle of Britain was the first part of a plan by the Germans for an invasion of Britain. The Germans called this plan Operation Sea-Lion. The Battle of Britain was the German attempt to get air supremacy over Britain for a landing of the Wermacht on the South coast of Britain.

==Background==
Before the Battle of Britain, Germany had launched Blitzkrieg on France and the low countries, and it also had control of Norway and Denmark. This gave Germany many airbases near the British coast. This allowed them to launch attacks on Britain from the air.

Germany never launched an invasion of Britain, but launched attacks by air. Germany bombed ports, factories and centres of population including London. They hoped that, with mounting casualties, the British would surrender. They also did this to knock out the Royal Air Force in a couple weeks, or RAF, so that an invasion would be possible. The Germans planned to knock out the RAF by attrition. They hoped with their superior numbers they would be able to take losses better. Instead, the British fought harder, and the Germans were unable to destroy Britain's air defenses in several months.

==Reasons for failure==
One of the reasons the Germans failed was that their fighters were overstretched and so could not accompany the German bombers. Later in the Second World War when the roles of Britain and Germany were reversed the British also had high losses when bombing France and Germany.

==The End of the Battle==
When some stray German bombers attacked London, in retaliation Churchill ordered the bombing of Berlin. In retaliation to this Hitler ordered the emphasis of attacks to focus on London. These attacks became known as the Blitz.

==Long-Term Effects==
The failure of Germany to knock out Britain, meant Germany would have to fight a war on two fronts when Germany invaded the USSR.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The invasion of Normandy, codenamed 'Operation Overlord', began on June 6, 1944, with the landing of airborne and amphibious troops in Normandy. The initial landing phase of this operation was the largest amphibious operation in history. The invasion culminated in Operation Cobra on July 24.

== Preparation ==
=== Early Planning ===
Proposals for opening up a 'second front' as early as Autumn 1942 were being considered by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. An alternate plan, drawn up by then-Brigadier General Dwight D. Eisenhower, proposed a landing before April 1943. While this plan never came to fruition, it brought Eisenhower's organisational and diplomatic skill to the attention of senior political and military leaders in both America and Britain, leading to his rise to Supreme Allied Commander in Europe in less than two years.

Planning for an invasion of occupied France began in earnest after the Casablanca and Tehran Conferences in 1943. The costly failure of the Dieppe raid in December the previous year had ruled out a direct assault on a seaport. The need for air support and proximity to the U.K. narrowed the choice of landing sites to the Pas de Calais and Normandy. While attacking Normandy would pose logistical problems, Pas de Calais was heavily defended, and the rivers and canals in the area would prevent a breakout from the beachheads. As a result, Normandy was chosen to be the landing site.

In March 1943, Frederick E. Morgan, a British Lieutenant General, was appointed Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander, or COSSAC. During June and July, the COSSAC staff worked on a plan for a full-scale attack on Western Europe. This plan, named Operation Overlord, was presented to the British Chiefs of Staff Committe in mid-July and to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff later that month. This plan envisaged a landing in Normandy, the use of prefabricated Mulberry harbours, the deployment of American forces on the right and British troops on the left, an airborne operation to secure the flanks and seize strategic points and a diversionary operation in the south of France (Operation Dragoon). The plan stated that the operation was to be launched on May 1, 1944.

The COSSAC's plan was accepted at the Quebec Conference in August 1943 but it was several months before a Supreme Allied Commander was appointed. In November, General Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Allied Commander in Europe in preference to U.S. Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall. Shortly after, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery was appointed Commander in Chief of the Ground Forces and Commander of the 21st Army Group. Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the Overlord plan in December 1943. While the key features of the plan were accepted, Montgomery though that the landing would not succeed unless it was significantly expanded (the original plan called for the landing of three divisions by sea and two brigades by air; it was revised to five divisions by sea and three by air), at the expense of the invasion of southern France. The expansion also delayed the landings by little over a month.

In April and May 1944, Field Marshal Montgomery presented his strategy for the invasion of Normandy. It would involve a ninety-day battle in which the Allied forces would pivot on the town of Caen. In the first foty days, a lodgement in Normandy including Caen and Cherbourg would be created. Once Normandy was secured, there would be a breakout towards Brittany and the Atlantic ports on one flank, and a an assault on Paris on the right.

=== Operation Fortitude ===
One of the most crucial elements of the Allied plan for the landings in Normandy was Operation Bodyguard, a deception plan intended to mislead the Germans as to where and when the attack would come. Bodyguard was divided into a number of components, the most important of which was Operation Fortitude, which, in turn, was divided Fortitude North and South.

Fortitude North was designed to trick the Germans into thinking that an Allied invasion would come in Scandinavia, thus tying down German units there. A fictionary army, the British 4th Army, was created, and headquartered in Edinburgh Castle. Double agents were used to feed information about the arrival of troops in the area to the Germans. Fortitude North also involved simulated radio traffic between nonexistent army units. However, the use of false radio traffic failed to achieve anything as the Germans were not monitoring the radio traffic. Commando attacks, designed to look like preparations for a full-scale invasion, and naval activity, increased in Scandinavia. British diplomats began negotiations with neutral Sweden to obtain concessions that would have been beneficial to an invasion of Norway, such as the right to fly reconnaissance missions in Swedish airspace. A secondary effect of diplomatic pressure on Sweden was that the export of crucial ball bearings to Germany was halted.

Fortitude South was intended to convince the Germans that the invasion of France would come at Pas de Calais (this was a logical choice from a geographical standpoint: Pas de Calais is the closest part of France to England), would be executed by the 21st Army Group (which was acutally part of the invasion of Normandy) and the American 1st Army Group (which did not exist, and was supposedly under the command of General George S. Patton), and would be preceeded by a diversionary attack at Normandy. Fortitude South involved a massive amount of false radio traffic, increased activity around Dover (intended to look like preparations for an invasion), the placement of dummy vehicles and landing craft near Dover and a supposedly pre-invasion bombing camapaign against targets near Pas de Calais. The most important part of Fortitude South was the use of double agents loyal to the Allies, including captured German agents, to feed misinformation to the Germans. One particularly important double agent was Joan Pujol Garcia, codenamed Garbo by the British. Operating the Portugal while pretending to be in the U.K., Garbo developed a network of nonexistent agents who were supposedly working for him.

Even after the landings in Normandy, the Allies maintained that the main attack would come in Pas de Calais, tying up German troops which could have been used as reinforcements.

=== Preparations for the Landings ===
Two armies, the British 2nd Army and American 1st Army, were used in the Normandy landings.

The British 6th Airborne Division was to be delivered by parachute and glider to the east of the River Orne to protect the left flank of the attack. The 2nd Army was also responsible for three beaches; from east to west, they were Sword, Juno and Gold. The 2nd Army included some 83 thousand troops, of which approximately a quarter were Canadian.

The American 1st Army included the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions. The former was to be dropped Vierville-sur-Mer to support the landing at Utah Beach; the latter was initially tasked with dropping in the middle of the Cotentin Peninsula to ease access to the Peninsula and prevent the Germans from reinforcing it, but, due to the presence of German forces in the drop zone, their mission was changed to guarding the right flank of Utah Beach. Units of the 1st Army would land at Omaha Beach and Utah Beach further west. The 1st Army consisted of about 76 thousand men.

The naval part of the operation, often regarded as a masterpiece of military planning, was under the command of Royal Navy Admiral Sir Betram Ramsay, who had been in charge of the evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk several years earlier, as well as the naval part of the landings in North Africa and Sicily. Almost seven thousand ships were involved, including 1200 battleships and over 4 thousand transports. The vast majority of these ships were British. Of the nearly 200 thousand naval personnel, about sixty percent were British and half that number American, with the rest coming from other countries. The warships were tasked with guarding the transports against submarines, surface ships or attacking aircraft, as well as supporting the landings with a shore bombardment.

=== German Preparations ===
Throughout 1942 and 1943, the Germans had believed that there was very little possibility of a successful Allied invasion of western Europe. While strong fortifications protected the major ports, German preparations for an invasion were otherwise limited. In late 1943, ''Generalfeldmarschall'' Gerd von Rundstedt, commander of ''Oberbefehlshaber West'' or OB West, the German Army Command in the West, seeing the buildup of Allied forces in Britain, requested reinforcements. Fresh troops were duly sent.

At around the same time, ''Generalfeldmarschall'' Erwin Rommel, renowned for his successes in North Africa and regarded as one of the best commanders in the ''Wehrmacht'', arrived in northern France to inspect the Atlantic Wall, as the coastal defences of Western Europe were called. After his inspection, Rommel asked Hitler for command of the defenders of northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands. These units were formed into Army Group B and put under Rommel's command. Rommel realised that the Atlantic Wall only protected the major ports. Thus, he had bunkers and pillboxes built, steel obstacles placed the the high-water marks at the beaches and low-lying areas flooded. Booby-trapped stakes (known as ''Rommelspargel'' or 'Rommel's asparagus') were set up further inland to deter or disrupt airborne landings.

In addition to static fortifications, Rommel wanted to use the Panzer Group West to defend the coast. However, there was a disagreement on the use of mobile forces. While Rommel wanted to put them close to the coast to use them in a counterattack against the invaders while they were vulnerable, ''General''Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg, the commander of the Panzer Group, wanted to concentrate them in Paris use them in a massive counterattack against the main Allied beachhead. Hitler imposed a compromise: most of the armored and mechanised units would be scattered across France and the Low Countries, while Rommel was given Panzer divisions, of which only one could reach the beaches in one day.

=== Exercise Tiger ===
Allied forces rehearsed their roles in the Normandy landings for months prior to the actual invasion. Exercises began in December 1943.

Exercise Tiger was a full-scale rehearsal of the attack on Utah Beach that occured in April 1944. Thirty thousand American troops were to participate in the mock landing at Slapton Sands on the coast of Lyme Bay in southern England. Nine German E-boats sighted the convoy of eight landing ships off the coast and attacked. Two landing ships were set on fire, of which one made it back to shore, and another sank shortly after being torpedoed. The remaining ships and their escorts retaliated, and the E-boat attacks ceased. A further landing ship was damaged by friendly fire. In the attack, 638 servicemen were killed. The surviving landing ships proceeded to land on Slapton Sands. General Eisenhower had ordered that the beach be shelled with live ammunition to simulate combat conditions. There was white tape on the beach which the troops were not supposed to advance beyond until the live shelling had stopped; however, some disregarded these orders and 308 men were killed.

Due to embarrasment and fear of leaks, survivors were sworn to secrecy. Ten missing officers had Bigot-level clearance, which mean that they had knowledge of the invasion plans. Fearing that they had been captured alive, the invasion was almost called off. Their bodies were later recovered. The casualty count was not released until after the Normandy landings.

=== Weather ===
The window of opportunity for a successful invasion was limited. A full moon was required, both for a spring tide and light for the aircraft pilots. Thus, there were only a few days each month on which an invasion could happen. Eisenhower selected June 5 as the date for the invasion, that is, D-Day. (While the term 'D-Day' is most often associated with the Normandy landings, as a general military term it refers to the day on which an operation is to begin.) However, on the night June 3, the weather was bad. High winds and low cloud made it unsuitable for a landing. It was forecast that the bad weather would continue for three or four days. At a meeting of senior Allied commanders, Eisenhower decided to postpone the invasion until June 6. If weather did not improve somewhat within forty-eight hours, the invasion would have to be postponed for two weeks. Not only would this have decreased the morale of the Allied troops, who were already being loaded onto the ships, the invasion would have run into what Churchill called &quot;the worst Channel storm in forty years&quot;. Early in the morning of June 4, it was agreed at another meeting that the postponement would stand.

Meanwhile, the Germans, confident that the Allies would not launch an invasion in adverse weather conditions, relaxed. Some troops stood down, and many senior officers left, some of them for wargames. Rommel was attending his wife's birthday.

Late on June 4, a meeting of the senior Allied commanders was convened again. Weather forecasts indicated that on June 6, the weather would improve slightly. Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory, the commander of the air forces, expressed his concern that visibility would be insufficient for the air operations to proceed. However, the other commanders agreed that the operation should go ahead on June 6. At a morning conference the next day, the final decision was made. Overlord was on.

=== Coordination with the French Resistance ===
The leaders of the French Resistance, most of whom were in the U.K., organised a massive sabotage campaign to increase the chances of a successful landing. The Resistance would attack railway lines, ambush roads and destroy other buildings of tactical signifance, such as telephone exchanges.

The BBC regularly broadcasted short messages in French to the Resistance. While these messages were seemingly meaningless, the few significant messages, masked by hundreds of meaningless ones, either instructed the resistance to commit a certain act of sabotage or gave them information. For example &quot;''Bercent mon coeur d'une langueur monotone''&quot; (&quot;soothe my heart with a monotonous languor&quot;), the second line of Paul Verlaine's poem ''Chanson d'Automne'', notified the Resistance that the invasion was imminent. Nazi intelligence had actually discovered the meaning of &quot;''Bercent mon coeur d'une langueur monotone''&quot;, but when military commanders in France were notified, the warning was not heeded as a false alarm had been raised in the past.

== D-Day ==
=== Airborne Operations ===
The purpose of the airborne operations just prior to the main amphibious landings was to allow the Allied troops to come ashore without being threatened by German counterattacks before they had consolidated their beachheads. The paratroopers were tasked with demolishing bridges that the enemy could use for a counterstroke agains the beachheads, and with securing bridges that the Allied forces might have to pass. They would also clear landing zones for the gliders, most of which would come later carry heavy equipment such as jeeps.

==== British Operations ====
There British airborne forces comprised one division, the 6th Airborne, which in turn was composed of the 5th and 3rd Parachute Brigades.

D-Day opened with a glider assault by units of the 5th Parachute Brigade against the bridge across the Caen Canal (later renamed the Pegasus Bridge) fifteen minutes after midnight. After briefly exchanging fire with a few sentries, the paratroopers were able to secure the bridge. Shortly after this, another glider assault commenced with the objective of seizing a bridge across the River Orne. Despite a navigational error by a pilot which led to one of the three gliders landing eight miles (13km) east of its intended target, the bridge was secured without further misadventure. These two bridges were the only routes by which the Germans could launch a flank attack at Sword Beach; they were also crucial for the Allied attack on Caen. The heavy cloud cover and poor navigation meant that many of the pathfinders were widely scattered; only one team was dropped correctly. Another was wiped out by RAF Avro Lancasters that had missed their target. Thus, the rest of the brigade was also scattered. The 7th Battalion managed to run into the defenders of the two previously mentioned bridges. After setting up defences, they managed to hold the bridges against a number of German counterattacks. One one occasion, the Germans deployed a tank, which was subsequently destroyed with an anti-tank weapon. On another, the ''Luftwaffe'' attempted to bomb the bridge, but the bomb failed to detonate. The 12th and 13th Battalions were tasked with capturing Las Bas de Ranville and Ranville to secure the bridgehead; despite heavy mortar and artillery fire, they completed their mission.

The first unit of the 3rd Parachute Brigade to land was the 9th Battalion. Due to the wide dispersal of the paratroopers, only a quarter gathered at the drop zone when the commander, Lieutenant Colonel Otway, decided to begin the assault on their primary objective, the Merville gun battery. After breaching the defensive perimeter with Bangalore torpedoes, the battalion attacked, but the defenders, who had been alerted to the threat by the explosions, inflicted heavy casualties. Despite a fifty percent casualty rate, they managed to reach the battery and destoy it, although one of the guns was not permanently put out of action. After capturing the village of Le Plein, the battalion was unable to complete any further objectives. The 8th Parachute Battalion was tasked with destroying two bridges at Bures and another at Troarn. With the exception of a brief firefight, their day was anticlimatic, as they found that all three of the bridges that had been tasked with destroying were already demolished. The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was tasked with destroying a bridge at Robehomme and another at Varaville. They ran into no resistance on their way to Robehomme, but the sappers tasked with destroying the bridge were not present. They arrived several hours late. Another detachment of the Battalion moved towards Varaville to destroy the bridge and several other objectives, but ran into almost a hundred defenders who had fortified the town. Nevertheless, they managed to persuade the Germans to surrender with concentrated mortar fire.

==== American Operations ====

=== The Landings ===
==== Naval Bombardment ====
Prior to the beginning of the actual amphibious landings, there was a naval bombardment beginning at 0550, which targeted not only pillboxes, bunkers etc. on the actual beaches, but also targeted coastal batteries and areas further inland to disrupt German troop movements. Some landing craft were equipped with howitzers and rockets, among other artillery, to act as fire support in conjunction with the larget ships. After the event, the German commander Field Marshal von Rundstedt would comment that the battleships were &quot;quickly mobile, constantly available artillery&quot; and that they &quot;play[ed] an important part in the battle within their range&quot; as they prevented any movement of tanks. However, despite their immense firepower, the impact on the beaches was unimpressive; many bunkers still remained.

==== Sword Beach ====
The easternmost landing beach was Sword Beach, assaulted by units of the British 3rd Division (and units attached to the division) under the command of Major-General Thomas Rennie. Sword Beach stretched five miles (8km) from Ouistreham to Aubin-sur-Mer, although landings would occur on a sector 1.8 miles (3km) long between Hermanville-sur-Mer and Colleville-sur-Orne (later renamed Collevillle-Montgomery) which was divided into Queen White and Queen Red sectors. The 8th Brigade, 1st Battalion of the South Lancashire Regiment and 2nd Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment would form the first wave. Three battalions of the 185th Brigade, supported by the Staffordshire Yeomanry, would march on Caen, while the 9th Brigade was tasked with protecting the right flank of the beach and linking up with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division landing at Juno Beach. Finally, the 1st Special Service Brigade (i.e. commandos), commanded by Brigadier Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, would capture Ouistreham and link up with the 6th Airborne paratroopers at Bénouville.

Forming the first wave were a number of tanks and demolition teams. Some of the tanks ran into the path of the landing craft carrying the demolition teams, but quick manoeuvering prevented a potential disaster, and most of the tanks reached the beach safely. The first tanks and troops ashore were immediately greeted with German fire, which was fortunately rather moderate. Ten minutes later, units of the 1st South Lancashire Regiment and 2nd East Yorkshire Regiment landed, along with a number of French commandos attached to Lord Lovat's brigade. The German defenders were suppressed without much trouble, and by 0800 the British troops had advanced beyond the beaches. In another five hours the commandos had linked up with the paratroopers on the Caen Canal and Orne. However, the troops on Sword were unable to link up with the Canadians on Juno.

At 1600, German tank forces and mechanized infantry units from the 21st Panzer Division launched the only German counterattack of any significance on D-Day. After being joined by the 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment, they managed to reach the beaches between Sword and Juno after four hours, but the division's ninety-eight panzers were stopped by anti-tank weapons, airstrikes and Allied tanks.

At the end of the day, the 3rd Division had landed twenty-nine thousand troops in Normandy at a cost of about 630 casualties, but had failed to join up with the Canadians in Juno and to seize the town of Caen: they were stopped three miles short of it by German panzers. Although Sword and Juno would be joined in a few days, the capture of Caen would finally take place some six weeks behind schedule.

==== Juno Beach ====
Juno Beach spanned six miles (10km) from Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer to Courseulles-sur-Mer and was just west of Sword Beach. It was assigned to the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and attached units, under the command of Major-General Rodney Keller. Juno was divided into two main sectors: Mike in the west and Nan in the east. The 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade would assault Mike with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, The Canadian Scottish Regiment and the 1st Hussars. They were to then take Courseulles and move inland. Nan was assigned to the Regina Rifle Regiment of 7th Brigade, as well as the North Shore Regiment and the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada of the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade. The 8th Brigade was to capture Bernières and the western edge of Saint-Aubin. By the end of D-Day, the 3rd Division was supposed to have secured the high ground to the west of Caen, the seaside towns of Courseulles, Bernières, Saint-Aubin and Beny-sur-Mer and the Bayeux–Caen railway line.

==== Sword Beach ====

==== Omaha Beach ====

==== Utah Beach ====

Behind the advanced assault of airborne soldiers came the primary invasion of three American infantry divisions, the 4th, 29th,and 1st Infantry Divisions on beaches codenamed Utah and Omaha, with two British Divisions and one Canadian on beaches marked Sword, Gold, and Juno. With the placement of infantry on mainland France, the battle of Normandy had begun. A battle that in the end would involve the liberation of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Denmark and Norway amongst others and bring the Nazi control of western Europe to an end.

Basic chemical information searching tips

   Hi,I am chelsea,working in a chemical trade platform([http://www.lookchem.com]) . welcome to visit our web page.
   I have seen something useful,now I will share with you. If you follow these tips below, your work will be easier and you will learn the practice of professional research along the way. 
I. Whenever possible, use the CAS Number (also known as the Registry Number), NOT a synonym or common name, to look up your chemical. Information resources may not have synonym indexes. Even if they do, they may use a different synonym than you. Some chemicals have dozens of synonyms. CAS Numbers are unique for each chemical and constant in all sources.

II. Use indexes. All information resources have index pages, and sometimes entire index volumes separate from the main volumes. Also look for &quot;legend&quot; pages to describe the information each entry contains.
III. Depending on your chemical, you may need to look up information in printed reference books, online databases, or both. Online resources are available through the library’s web site. You may be able to complete this assignment exclusively using the library’s electronic sources. But not everything is online—especially not in the free domain accessible with tools like Wikipedia and Google—so do not neglect print resources. Print resources for this assignment are available in the D.H. Hill Library reference collection (in the Learning Commons, 1st floor, east wing). Print resources can provide thorough information that is difficult to search for online, and can be surprisingly quick and easy to use.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You will need to know how to draw basic shapes before you can draw more complex shapes. This page will teach you how to draw these shapes. The shape tools are useful because they allow you to make and manipulate basic forms easily.

All shapes have control handles that can be dragged to manipulate various aspects. Sometimes it's better to use the shape's resize handles, instead of the Selector's generic resize abilities. While the Selector resizes relative to ''the document'', the shape tools will resize relative to ''the object''. Experiment with both to see which works best for you. (Use '''Ctrl-Z''' to undo any changes you don't want to keep.) To restrain the resize handles, '''Ctrl-drag''' them. This limits movement to 15-degree steps. To change the step size, go to '''File &gt; Inkscape Preferences''' and choose '''Steps'''.

==Rectangles==
[[Image:Inkscape_rectangle_tool.png|right|thumb|200px|A rounded rectangle with all handles extended.]]
Keyboard Shortcut - '''F4''' or '''R'''

To draw a rectangle, select the rectangle tool and drag from the top left to the bottom right. Hold down '''Ctrl''' while dragging to create a ratio-proportionate rectangle (e.g. a square). Hold '''Shift''' while dragging to draw the rectangle from its center.

Rectangles have four handles: the square ones control the size and aspect ratio, the round ones control rounding of corners. ('''Shift-click''' the handle to remove rounding.) One rounding handle is vertical, and makes rectangles more circular; the other is horizontal, and makes rectangles more elliptical.

==3D Boxes==
The 3D Box tool is an easy way to create a 3-dimensional rectangle. To select only one side of a 3D box, '''Ctrl-click''' it.

==Ellipses==
[[Image:Inkscape_ellipse_tool.png|left|thumb|200px|The ellipse tool, describing a segment.]]
Keyboard shortcut - '''F5''' or '''E'''

To draw an ellipse, circle, or an arc, select the ellipse tool (looks like a ellipse), and drag from the top left to the bottom right. The ellipse tool has four handles: two rectangular ones control the size and aspect ratio; two circular ones control the angle of the arc. Dragging the circular handles ''outside'' the ellipse makes a segment; dragging them ''inside'' creates an arc. '''Alt-click''' one of the circular handles to completely close the ellipse.

==Stars and Polygons==
Keyboard Shortcut - '''Shift-8'''

To switch between star and polygon, click the star-shaped or polygon-shaped icon in the ''Tool Controls bar'' of the Star/Polygon tool.

Stars and polygons have two handles: one outer handle, for stretching and rotation, and one inner handle, for skewing. '''Ctrl-drag''' the outer handle in order to stretch without rotating, and '''Ctrl-drag''' the inner handle to change the ratio of the two handles without skewing.

==Spirals==
[[Image:Inkscape_spiral_tool.png|right|thumb|200px|Spiral tool, describing a spiral with 12 turns and a divergence of .25.]]
Keyboard shortcut - '''F9''' or '''I'''

To draw a spiral, select the spiral tool and draw, observing the results. The spiral has two handles at each end of it-an inner one and an outer one. Dragging the handles lengthens and shortens the spiral.

''Shift-drag'' the outer handle to scale and rotate the spiral.

'''Alt-drag''' the inner handle to change the divergence (distance between the loops). To make the distance really big, hold '''Alt''' and move the inner handle first towards the center, and then further in the same direction beyond the center, and possibly beyond the external boundary of the spiral. Spirals with a divergence less than 1 are denser towards the edges; ones with divergence greater than 1 are denser towards the center. To reset divergence, '''Alt-click''' the handle. '''Shift-click''' the handle to return it to the center.

Experiment with the handles and the '''Shift''' and '''Alt''' keys to get a grip on the tool.

==Fill and Stroke==
All shapes have a fill and a stroke. (One exception to this is the spiral, which should only be given a stroke.) The stroke is the outline of the shape. The fill is the area inside the shape. To set fill and stroke colors, select the shape and go to '''Object &gt; Fill and Stroke''', or press '''Ctrl-Shift-F'''. Objects can be filled with solid, flat color from the inkscape pallet, a linear or radial gradient fill, or a pattern fill.

==Bitmap images==&lt;!--Alternative title: Raster images--&gt;
To insert a bitmap image—PNG or JPEG, paste it from the clipboard or drag and drop a bitmap file from the desktop. In this way, the images are only linked to, not embedded.

To turn some or all of the linked bitmap images into ''embedded images'', use in menu '''Effects &gt; Images &gt; Embed images'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Weed Management'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Weed control is at the core of gardening, since without it the garden would eventually revert to meadow, scrubland, and eventually forest. As with most garden chores, prevention and diligence are key, since weedy plants tend to grow much faster than ornamentals and crops. 

Long-term control requires three steps when engaging in weed control: knowing the weeds, removing the weeds, and preventing the re-emergence of the weeds. 

==1. Know the Weeds==
Like cultivated plants, each species of weed has its unique optimal growth conditions, habit, and life cycle, so being able to identify the weeds is essential for achieving effective control. Some weeds are easily controlled within a season, while others may require a longer-term commitment, but knowing how a weed spreads and reproduces enables the gardener to come up with a management plan for each type.

For professional gardeners, learning the common weeds found in the region is both easier and more useful than knowing the cultivated plants, since most gardens will only have perhaps 20 species of weed, while on the other hand having many more species and cultivars of desired plants. Knowing which plants should ''always'' be removed -- and knowing the best way to remove and dispose of them -- makes it much easier to simply jump into a garden and clean it up, rather than needing a &quot;tour&quot; of each new site to see what the &quot;good plants&quot; are. 

===Annual vs. Perennial===
The simplest distinction that needs to be made is whether a weed is an annual (growing from seeds each year), or perennial (growing from persistent roots or woody parts). Annual weeds can in most cases be controlled with greater ease, since one needs only interrupt the reproductive cycle, while perennials need to be controlled at the root as well as breaking the reproductive cycle.

Perennial weeds tend to have more substantive root systems, and most will grow back if at least the vast majority of the root is not removed or otherwise destroyed. Serious infestations of rhizomatous or stoloniferous plants (such as canada thistle, mugwort, nutsedge, or bindweed) may require soil barriers to smother the plants over a season. 

Annual weeds, on the other hand, tend to be much easier to pull, but also produce very large amounts of seed, since they do not use any energy on building up reserves of starches to survive winters (or summers, in the case of winter annuals). 

Biennial weeds are somewhere in between, since they spend their first year building up starches, and then use up all these starches at the end of their life cycles to produce seeds.

The second most important thing to know is when the seeds are produced and how they are spread. Removing weeds ''after'' they have gone to seed does nothing to prevent further germination (which can be an even greater problem when herbicides are used, since even after the weed appears to be &quot;dead&quot;, the seeds can in many cases continue to develop). Grubbing before flowers are produced is the best time. If flowers are already present, the weeds should be treated as if seeds were present when deciding on a disposal method.

===Roots===
Knowing the type of root that a weed has, how firmly it is attached to the above ground parts, as well as how much of the root is needed for the plant to re-grow is important for proper, long-term control. Weeds with taproots or woody roots require digging tools for removal, while plants with shallow or noncomplex root systems can often simply be pulled by hand. See the chapter on [[../Weeding tools|weeding tools]].

===How weeds spread===

All weeds spread by seed, and some perennials also spread vegetatively (through roots, stolons, etc.). How seeds are transported from the parent plant to the garden is important to understand, particularly since some weeds are easily spread on feet or on tools. 

Weeds that spread vegetatively are often the most intractable, since stoloniferous and rhizomatous weeds often grow back from even the smallest root fragments. Such weeds can best be controlled by soil barriers (such as newspaper and mulch), by removing and replacing the soil outright, or when those methods are simply not an option (for example, when perennial weeds are growing among desirable plants that cannot be transplanted away), control can be achieved after a time by diligent and regular grubbing.

Weeds that spread by seed can often be managed with a preventative approach. The most effective preventative is simply ensuring that the soil is always covered by a layer of seed-free mulch, since this will prevent any seeds on the soil surface from being exposed to light, which is the signal that causes many seeds to germinate. For this same reason, any time the soil is disturbed (by grubbing weeds, planting, or any other reason), fresh mulch should be added to cover up the disturbed area, since weed seeds will have been brought to the surface.

Weeds can also be controlled using Corn Gluten Meal (CGM), which is a byproduct of corn processing. While this only works for smaller seeds, it is an excellent choice for lawns and other areas (such as vegetable gardens) where mulches can't be used. CGM breaks down into nitrogen and other fertilizers after 4-6 weeks, after which it must be re-applied. 

Seed dispersal methods vary from plant to plant. Many plants rely on birds or other animals to disperse the seeds. Others are spread by wind. Finally, many are spread by foot traffic, tools, lawn mowers, etc. 

Birds spread seeds by eating the fruits, then passing the seeds a short while later. Bird-spread weeds are thus most common around the edges of shrubs, under power lines or other places where the bird perches. Little can be done to prevent birds from spreading these seeds, so the soil underneath regular perching spots should simply be kept well-mulched or otherwise shaded (by dense ground covers, etc.) to prevent germination, and regularly patrolled for seedlings (particularly tree seedlings) that are able to germinate despite preventative measures.

Nut-producing trees generally rely on squirrels and other rodents to plant the seeds deep in the soil. Neither mulch nor CGM provides any control to these plants, since their germination is triggered by soil temperature and moisture. Discouraging squirrels or removing any nearby nut-producing trees are the only preventatives. Weeds of this group need to be pulled as soon as they are seen, since most of them quickly develop deep taproots that make larger plants very difficult to remove. 

Wind-spread seeds end to settle against windbreaks or in low areas. The germination of smaller seeds can be prevented by either CGM or diligent mulching. Larger seeds (such as maple, ash, tuliptree, etc.) should be blown off after they fall, before additional mulch is laid down. 

Finally, weed seeds are also found in the soil itself, lying dormant under the surface (these seeds are known as the &quot;soil seed bank&quot;). This is why it is important to always add fresh mulch after weeds are removed, because once these dormant seeds are exposed to sunlight, they will germinate almost immediately. 

Many of the most common weeds of the region produce very small seeds that are dispersed on feet, tools, and other equipment. While these weeds are among the most numerous found in the field, their numbers can be drastically reduced by proper hygiene in the garden. When pulling these weeds, hey should be immediately put into a container (never left on the lawn, soil, or even on hard surfaces), tools should be wiped down after working near them or in soil where they are present, and shoes should be wiped or hosed off when moving from a weedy area to an area already cleaned. 

With all weeds, a key management strategy is to prevent seeds from being produced whenever possible. For example, nearby waste areas, unkempt woodlands, or invaded wildflower meadows should be monitored for problem weeds, and where possible mown or cleared before the seeds ripen. In many cases it is certainly worthwhile to eradicate seed sources even on neighboring properties (even just mowing or trimming weeds before the seeds ripen). 

==2. Preparation and the waste stream==
Once the weeds found on a site have been identified, the next step is to have the right tools ready, prepare for dealing with the waste stream, and finally make sure the site is ready to be worked on. 

Tools include a hand cultivator to loosen soil around the roots, a hoe for larger areas that have only seedlings, a tote to put the weeds in (or two totes, if using &quot;split-stream&quot; disposal), pruners for tree seedlings that are too well-established to pull out effectively, and finally a pair of gloves for removing spiny, thorny, or poisonous plants. 

For disposal a compost area should be kept ready to accept materials. If using &quot;hot&quot; composting, all materials can go to the same place. If a cold compost system is being used on-site, seed-bearing materials must be kept separate in order to prevent further dispersal when the compost is used in the garden. 

To prepare the site, make sure the edges are well-defined, if possible make sure the lawn was recently mown, and (again, if possible) the soil should me moist but not wet to make roots easier to remove.

Finally, a supply of mulch should be on-hand to cover any areas of soil that are disturbed during the process. 

==3. Removing the weeds and preventing re-emergence==
Once the weeds are identified and the tools and site are prepared, it's time to start grubbing them out. Different weed species require different removal methods, but the control method will also depend on where they are growing, the density of the desired plantings, etc.

In large, open areas where there are not currently any desirable plants, hoeing (particularly with stirrup hoes or offset hoes) is often the most efficient way to get the weeds out. If some plants are unable to be hoed, follow up with a mattock-type cultivator or if necessary with a spade for deeply tap-rooted plants. When hoeing, always follow up immediately by raking off the area, and then adding a layer of mulch.

In areas that are more densely planted, use the claw part of a mattock-type cultivator to loosen the soil below the weed by hitting just behind it and prying gently. This allows the root system to be removed intact, and is especially important for weeds that spread by rhizomes or are easily broken away from the root system when pulling. Mulch areas where the soil has been loosened immediately in order to prevent any newly-exposed soil seeds from germinating.

If the soil is soft and moist enough, simply manually pulling is often the easiest way. When pulling by hand, use a slow, firm motion rather than trying to jerk the weeds out, since this will more often than not cause the top of the weed to simply break off of the root. If gloves are worn, make sure the gloves fit very tightly so that the gardener can grab the plant just ''beneath'' the soil surface at the crown, rather than trying to pull by the above-ground stems. Again, add mulch to prevent new weeds from germinating.

If weeds are growing within the crowns of desirable plants, first try simply pulling, making sure to grab just below the soil line and also making sure that the weed (not the garden plant) is what's being pulled. 

In more extreme cases (such as when lawn grass or other grasses get into a perennial forb), it may be necessary to dig up the plant, separate out the weed roots (bare-rooting may be necessary), and replant. Bear in mind that the perennial will be stressed in the process, and may need shelter from direct sunlight for a few days, and may need extra irrigation for several weeks if this is done in summer. Alternatively, simply snip the weeds at the soil line and return regularly, putting off digging until fall when the plant will not be as badly stressed. 

In all cases, remember to put the weeds directly into a container for disposal, since putting the weeds on soil, lawn, or other surfaces will give the plant an opportunity to drop its seeds as it dries out, and risks leaving perennial root fragments behind that may regrow under the new mulch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We will now discuss some important set operations. Recall from the preliminaries that we only intuitively define a set to be a collection of distinct mathematical objects. There are much better and rigorous definitions of what sets are and form a subject for study all by itself, into which we will not delve.

Recall the meaning of the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, which reads &quot;is an element of&quot; so that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; an object, then &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt; a is a statement (which is either true of false, depending on whether &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;).


= Sets and Set operations =

In the following discussion, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; denote any sets.

== Definitions ==

=== The empty set: &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; ===
We will assume that the empty set exists, and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. As the name suggests, the empty set contains no elements so that for any object &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the statement &lt;math&gt;x\in \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; is false.

=== Set equality ===
Usually there is no ambiguity when we use the symbol &quot;=&quot; to refer to equality between sets. It is important that equality between sets is completely different to equality between numbers.

We define the logical statement &quot;&lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;&quot; to be true by definition when the statement &quot;&lt;math&gt;x\in A \Leftrightarrow x\in B&lt;/math&gt;&quot; (which reads &quot;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;&quot;) is true, and false otherwise. Intuitively this means that sets are equal if and only if they contain exactly the same elements. For example, &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}=\{1,2\}&lt;/math&gt; is false since &quot;&lt;math&gt;3\in \{1,2\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is false. It might be helpful to check the truth table to see that &quot;&lt;math&gt;3\in \{1,2,3\} \Leftrightarrow 3\in \{1,2\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is a false statement. It should then be clear that &quot;&lt;math&gt;\{5,6,7\}=\{5,6,7\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is true.

=== Subsets ===
If every element of the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, we then say that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

Rigorously, we say that the statement &quot;&lt;math&gt;A\subset B&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is true by definition when the statement &quot;&lt;math&gt;x\in A \Rightarrow x\in B&lt;/math&gt;&quot; (which reads &quot;If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;&quot;) is true.

We have seen previously that the statement &lt;math&gt;\{1,2\}=\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; is false, however the statement &lt;math&gt;\{1,2\}\subset \{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; is true. It should be clear that &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,5\}\subset \{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt; is false, since the statement &quot;&lt;math&gt;5\in \{1,2,3,5\} \Rightarrow 5 \in \{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is false.

=== Intersection ===
We define the intersection of sets by the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. Rigorously we write &quot;&lt;math&gt;A\cap B := \{x|x\in A \land x\in B\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; which reads &quot;The intersection of the sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is by definition equal to the set which contains exactly the elements which are contained in both &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

For example &quot;&lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4\}\cap \{1,4,5\}:=\{1,4\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

We say that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are '''disjoint''' when &lt;math&gt;A\cap B = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Union ===
We define the union of sets by the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. Rigorously we write &quot;&lt;math&gt;A\cup B := \{x|x\in A \lor x\in B\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; which reads &quot;The union of the sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is by definition equal to the set which contains exactly the elements which are contained in either one of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

For example &quot;&lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4\}\cup \{1,4,5\}:=\{1,2,3,4,5\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

=== Complement ===
To define the complement of the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; we assume that the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of some universal set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. We say &quot;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; lives in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. Often the universal set is implicitly clear, for example when we are studying real analysis we often just assume &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; or when studying complex analysis we assume &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. 

We define the complement of a set by the superscript &quot;&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. Rigorously &quot;&lt;math&gt;A^c := \{x \in X | \lnot x\in A\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; which reads &quot;the complement of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all elements which are contained in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and not in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

For example, if we assume &lt;math&gt;X=\{1,2,3,4,5\}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\{1,5\}^c:=\{2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Relative complement ===
We define the relative complement of sets by the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\backslash&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. Rigorously, &quot;&lt;math&gt;A\backslash B := \{x\in A | \lnot x\in B\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; which reads &quot;the relative complement of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is by definition equal to the set containing all the elements contained in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and is not contained in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

For example &quot;&lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4\}\backslash \{1,4,5\} := \{2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

== Some basic results ==

=== Lemma 1 ===
&lt;math&gt; (A = B) \Leftrightarrow (A\subset B) \land (B\subset A)&lt;/math&gt;. Which reads &quot;A equals B if and only if A is a subset of B AND B is a subset of A&quot;

'''proof'''
As explained in the previous chapter, &lt;math&gt; (A = B) \Leftrightarrow (A\subset B) \land (B\subset A)&lt;/math&gt; will be true by adjunction when both &lt;math&gt; (A = B) \Rightarrow (A\subset B) \land (B\subset A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;  (A\subset B) \land (B\subset A) \Rightarrow (A = B)&lt;/math&gt; are true.

We prove first &lt;math&gt; (A = B) \Rightarrow (A\subset B) \land (B\subset A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;, then by definition we have &lt;math&gt;x\in A \Leftrightarrow x\in B&lt;/math&gt;, which is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(x\in A \Rightarrow x\in B)\land (x\in A \Rightarrow x\in B)&lt;/math&gt;. By simplification we have that &lt;math&gt;x\in A \Rightarrow x\in B&lt;/math&gt; is true, and that &lt;math&gt;x\in A \Rightarrow x\in B&lt;/math&gt; is true. Therefore by definition &lt;math&gt;A \subset B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B\subset A&lt;/math&gt; are both true. By adjunction &lt;math&gt;(A\subset B)\land(B\subset A)&lt;/math&gt; is true. Therefore &lt;math&gt; (A = B) \Rightarrow (A\subset B) \land (B\subset A)&lt;/math&gt; is true.

Conversely, we prove &lt;math&gt;  (A\subset B) \land (B\subset A) \Rightarrow (A = B)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;  (A\subset B) \land (B\subset A)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, by simplification, both &lt;math&gt;A\subset B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\subset A&lt;/math&gt; are true. By definition both &lt;math&gt;x\in A \Rightarrow x\in B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in B \Rightarrow x\in A&lt;/math&gt; are true. By adjunction, &lt;math&gt;(x\in A \Rightarrow x\in B) \land (x\in B \Rightarrow x\in A)&lt;/math&gt; is true, which is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;x\in A \Leftrightarrow x\in B&lt;/math&gt;. Then by definition &lt;math&gt;A=B&lt;/math&gt; is true. Therefore &lt;math&gt;  (A\subset B) \land (B\subset A) \Rightarrow (A = B)&lt;/math&gt; is true. QED.

=== Lemma 2 ===
&lt;math&gt;A\subset A\cup B&lt;/math&gt;

=== Lemma 3 ===
&lt;math&gt;A\cap B\subset A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\cap B\subset B&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--

= Functions =
Functions are unambiguous associations between sets. Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be any sets. We say &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;a function from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and write &quot;&lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;&quot; when for every element, &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt; there exists ''exactly one element'' &lt;math&gt;y\in B&lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. We say &quot;&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and write &quot;&lt;math&gt;f:x\mapsto y&lt;/math&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;math&gt;f(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. We call &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the '''domain''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; the '''codomain''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

It is important to notice it is required that every element in the domain of a function is mapped to an element in the codomain, but not every element in the codomain needs to be mapped to. Also, different elements in the domain may be mapped to the same element in the codomain.

== Definitions ==

=== Injectivity ===
We say a function &lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; is '''injective''' exactly when &lt;math&gt;f(x_0)=f(x_1) \Rightarrow x_0 = x_1&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Importers====
When importing a data set, Opticks first displays the Open dialog which allows the user to select an importer and a file to import.  It calls the getType() method on each plug-in in the plug-ins directory and, for those that return ‘Importer’, it calls their getName() and getDefaultExtensions() methods and adds the name to the ‘Importer’ selection box and the extensions to the ‘File Type’ selection box.  When the user selects an importer from the selection box, Opticks calls the importer’s getDatasetParameters() method to determine if the selected file is a valid file that is recognized by the importer.  If the file is valid, the Options button is enabled. If the user then presses the Options button on the Open dialog, Opticks calls the plug-in’s getDatasetParameters() method again.  This allows the plug-in to parse the header of the file to be loaded and set the values in the DatasetParameters object appropriately.  The Options dialog is then populated with the values in the DatasetParameters and displayed.
When the user presses the Open button from the Open dialog, Opticks calls the plug-in’s getInputSpecification() and getOutputSpecification() methods.  It then fills the actual values on each plug-in arg and calls the plug-in’s execute() method to import the data set.

The ImporterShell class represents the shell for an importer plug-in.  Importer developers should take this class and extend it to support their importer-specific code.

 const char* getDefaultExtensions()

Takes no arguments.  Called by Opticks to get the valid file extensions to use as filters in the file selection dialog when importing the file.  This method returns a list of the extensions supported by the importer (as set in the plug-in's constructor with the setExtensions() method).  This list is returned as a character string.  The string consists of description followed by one or more file extensions separated by a semicolon.  Multiple file types may be specified with a double semicolon.  Examples include &quot;Landsat Header Files (*.hdr)&quot;, &quot;TIFF Files (*.tif; *.tiff)&quot;, and &quot;Source Files (*.c*);;Header Files (*.h)&quot;.
 bool getDatasetParameters()
Takes two arguments.  The first is a const char* that is the full path and filename of the dataset whose parameters are to be returned.  The second argument is a pointer to a DatasetParameters object.  This method fills the given DatasetParameters object with the parameters for the given file.  The default implementation of this method initializes the object and sets the modifiable flag to true for all parameters.  The method returns true if no errors occurred populating the DatasetParameters structure.  A common error is that the given file is not in the correct format for the importer.
 const void* getOptionsDialog()
This method provides an interface for which specialized options can be displayed to the user.  It takes a filename, which is the current filename selected for import as an argument, and a DatasetParameters pointer as arguments.  The method returns a void* pointer that is actually a handle to a Qt widget.  For importers with the SensorData subtype, the QWidget is added to the existing options dialog.  For other importers, the widget should be a QDialog that cen be displayed.  This method should return NULL if the importer does not have its own options widget.
All of the methods in Table 21 should be redefined by the importer plug-in.
In interactive mode, an importer’s execute() method is called by Opticks after the user has selected a file to load and an importer to load it with.  Additionally, the user may specify sampling criteria that indicate which portion of the cube is to be read.
Typically, an importer plug-in will read the header of the file it is to read and use the generic importer to read the data cube.  This frees the importer developer from the work of parsing the data cube according to potentially complicated sampling criteria.  See Section  for details on calling a plug-in from another plug-in.

====Exporters====
The ExporterShell class represents the shell for an exporter plug-in.  Exporter developers should extend this class to support their exporter-specific code.
 const char* getDefaultExtensions()
Takes no arguments.  Called by Opticks to get the valid file extensions to use as filters in the file selection dialog when importing the file.  This method returns a list of the extensions supported by the exporter (as set in the plug-in's constructor with the setExtensions() method).  This list is returned as a character string.  The string consists of description followed by one or more file extensions separated by a semicolon.  Multiple file types may be specified with a double semicolon.  Examples include &quot;Landsat Header Files (*.hdr)&quot;, &quot;TIFF Files (*.tif; *.tiff)&quot;, and &quot;Source Files (*.c*);;Header Files (*.h)&quot;.
 const void* getOptionsDialog()
This method provides an interface for which specialized options can be displayed to the user.  It takes a filename, which is the current filename selected for import as an argument, and a DatasetParameters pointer as arguments.  The method returns a void* pointer that is actually a handle to a Qt widget.  For importers with the SensorData subtype, the QWidget is added to the existing options dialog.  For other importers, the widget should be a QDialog that cen be displayed.  This method should return NULL if the importer does not have its own options widget.

====Viewers====
The ViewerShell is used to implement modeless dialog-based plug-ins. When a plug-in extends the ViewerShell , the plug-in automatically inherits code that properly destroy a modeless dialog. To provide default functionality to destroy the modeless dialog, the ViewerShell defines the following method that must be implemented in the developer's plug-in:

 virtual QWidget* getWidget() const = 0;

The ViewerShell destroys the dialog by overriding the PlugIn2::abort() method, getting the widget with getWidget(), and registering a PlugInCallback with DesktopServices to indicate that the plug-in has completed its implementation.  When the callback is executed, the dialog or widget is hidden and destroyed.  Then the plug-in is unloaded. Because the dialog is destroyed be calling abort(), derived plug-ins must also call the abort() method when the user closes the dialog or widget so that it will be destroyed.  This typically occurs in an overridden QWidget::closeEvent() method in the modeless dialog or widget.  See Section 5.3 for more details and example code for using modeless dialogs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Instructions on building Qt from source

Please note that there are only 32-bit binary builds of Qt available from TrollTech. Because of this, 
in order to run Qt in 64-bit, Qt must be manually built on windows in both 32-bit and 64-bit binary builds.

== Things to do before building Qt ==

# First extract the Qt zip file to a directory on your system.
# If you plan on building a 64-bit version of Qt, make a copy of the extracted Qt directory to another one, but add 64-bit to end of the new directory name. This new directory will be used to make the Qt 64-bit binary build. (For example if the name of the extracted Qt directory is Qt-win-src, then the name would be Qt-win-src-64-bit).   

== Building the 32-bit version ==
To make the 32-bit build of Qt, go to Visual Studio 2005-&gt;Visual Studio tools in the start menu and click on Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt.

In the Command Prompt, go to the 32-bit Qt directory you just extracted.

Once you are in the directory, type:

  configure.exe -qt-gif -qt-libpng -qt-libmng -qt-libtiff -qt-libjpeg

This will generate a Makefile.
   
Now to start the compilation, run nmake by typing:

  nmake

Once the compilation is complete, then type:

  nmake install

The reason for doing this is so you will only need the include directory from Qt, not the src one. 
   
The 32-bit binary build of Qt is now done.

== Building the 64-bit version ==

To make the 64-bit build of Qt, go to Visual Studio 2005-&gt;Visual Studio tools in the start menu and click on Visual Studio 2005 x64 Win64 Command Prompt.

In the Command Prompt, go to the 64-bit Qt directory you just extracted.

Once you are in the directory, type:

  configure.exe -qt-gif -qt-libpng -qt-libmng -qt-libtiff -qt-libjpeg

This will generate a Makefile.
   
Now to start the compilation, run nmake by typing:

  nmake

Once the compilation is complete, then type:

  nmake install

The reason for doing this is so you will only need the include directory from Qt, not the src one. 

The 64-bit binary build of Qt is now done.

== Setting up the folders ==

Once Qt is done building, don't move it to the dependencies folder just yet. You will still need to do some work on the files......(LOCO)

* Create a new directory named Qt in the dependencies folder.
* Inside the new Qt directory, Create the following 4 folders: bin, include, lib, and plugins.
* Inside each of these folders, Make a win32 folder if you are using the 32-bit version or a x64 folder if you are using the 64-bit version.

Copy all of the folders in the old Qt directory include folder and paste them in the new directory 

   include -&gt; win32/x64 folder.

Next go to the old Qt directory bin folder and copy all of the .dll files as well as the moc.exe, qmake.exe, rcc.exe, and uic.exe. Paste these files in the new Qt directory 

   bin -&gt; win32/x64 folder.

Also copy the .pdb files located in the old Qt directory lib folder and paste them in the new directory 

   bin -&gt; win32/x64 folder.

Now Move all of the .lib files in the old directory lib folder and put them in the new Qt directory

   lib -&gt; win32/x64 folder.

Go to the plugins win32/x64 folder in the new Qt directory and create a new folder named imageformats.

In the plugin -&gt; imageformats folder in the old directory, copy all files expect the .exp and .ilk files. Paste these in the plugins -&gt; win32/x64 -&gt; imageformats located in the new Qt directory.

Qt is now ready to run with Visual Studio.

      <comment>/* Characteristics */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">At the opening of the 20th century the dual-walled [[Beekeeping/WBC Hive|WBC hive]] was the most popular hive type used in the UK; however it was complicated to manipulate and by the 1920s alternative single walled designs had overtaken as the most popular hive types. One such single walled hive was chosen by the Ministry for Agriculture and named the 'British National'.

A standardised national hive design was seen as important enough for the British Standards Institute (BSI) to issue British Standard 1300 in 1946 which formalised the dimensions of the [[Beekeeping/WBC Hive|WBC]] as well as giving the design for the single walled 'Modified National'.  Shortage of wood supplies following the war caused the popularity of the dual-walled [[Beekeeping/WBC Hive|WBC]] to fall even further.

BS1300 was revised in 1960.  It was subsequently allowed to expire but the design laid out in BS1300:1960 is still the most popular hive design in use in the UK.

== Characteristics ==

There are several differences between the British National and the [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive|Langstroth Hive]]:

First is the location of the [[Beekeeping/bee space|bee space]].  British National frames hang level with the top of the box with a bee space gap at the bottom; unlike the [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive|Langstroth]] where the bee space is at the top of the box, though there are top-bee space variants of the national hive available.

Secondly the rebates in the British national box used for hanging the [[Beekeeping/frames|frames]] are wider allowing for longer top bars.  The British National has a top bar of 17&quot; with a comb width of 14&quot;, giving a 1.5&quot; lug on each side compared to 7/8&quot; on a Langstroth frame.

The third main difference is the overall dimensions.  The external dimensions of a British National box is 18 1/8&quot; square.

=== Components ===

==== Brood box ====

The British National brood box is 18 1/8&quot;x18 1/8&quot;x8 7/8&quot; made from 3/4&quot; timber.  

The internal dimensions are 16 5/8&quot;x14 5/8&quot; due to recessed side panels.  This is then filled with 12 frames, or 11 and a dummy frame, each having a comb area of 14&quot;x8 1/2&quot;.

==== Shallow box (Super) ====

The British National shallow box is 18 1/8&quot;x18 1/8&quot;x5 7/8&quot; made from 3/4&quot; timber.  

The internal dimensions are 16 5/8&quot;x14 5/8&quot; due to recessed side panels.  This is then generally filled with 9 or 10 frames each having a comb area of 14&quot;x5 1/2&quot;.

A shallow box may be used as an extension to the brood chamber (known as brood and a half).  In this case the shallow box would be filled with 11 frames and a dummy frame or 12 frames.

==== Deep Brood Box ====

Many strains of honey bee bred in the UK are not comfortable with their brood restricted to a single national brood box.  It is quite common for brood and a half to be used and with prolific strains such as [[Beekeeping/Honey_Bee_Races#Carniolan_Honey_Bee|Carniolan]] even this can be too little and two full size brood boxes are used.

While it was not part of the original standard it has become quite common to use a deeper brood box allowing the use of 14&quot;x12&quot; frames.  Comb area of various brood chambers are given for comparison below:

{| border=1
! Brood chamber type
! Comb Area
|-
| Single National Brood box
| 2618 sq. in. 
|-
| National 14x12 Brood box
| 3696 sq. in. 
|-
| Brood and a half
| 4312 sq. in.

| Double National Brood box
| 5236 sq. in. 
|-
|}

== Advantages ==

* Recessed sides of both brood box and supers provide a firm hand hold for lifting
* Smaller size of supers make them easier to lift
* Square profile of boxes means they can be rotated through 90 degrees on the floor allowing choice of having combs running parallel to the entrance (warm way) or perpendicular to the entrance (cold way)
* Long frame lugs assist in handling, especially in beginners.

== Disadvantages ==

* Reduced comb area in brood box can lead to congestion of the brood nest with prolific strains, unless alternative brood box configurations such as those mentioned above are used (eg. double brood).
* Smaller size of brood box and supers can lead to greater overall equipment costs to build an equivalent hive to other types.
* Smaller comb size can significantly increase the number of frames used in a hive, and thus inspection time and number of manipulations per hive.

      <comment>/* Sample Save XQuery */ typos and nav</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have an XML configuration file that only one person at a time will be editing.  You want to make it easy to edit the configuration file so that non-technical users without knowledge of XML or occasional users will not make any mistakes editing the file.

Note that this method may not be appropriate if multiple people might edit the same file or record simultaneously.  See the record locking section for more detail on this process.

== Method ==
We will load the entire file into an single XForms instance, edit it, and save the entire file.  This can be done with a single submission in the XForms application and a single '''store()''' operation in the eXist (or similar) database.  This can be done even if the configuration file is very complex, and has many sections and many repeating elements.  Regardless of the complexity of the file, you only need a single function call on the server to store the file.

== Program Outline ==
Let's assume that the file is stored in a single eXist collection such as my-config.xml.  To load this file into an XForms application, you simply put the document into an instance within the XForms model:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance src=&quot;my-config.xml&quot; id=&quot;config&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
   ...
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can then save the file by adding a submission element to the model that will save the file back to the database once the data has changed in the client.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:submission id=&quot;save&quot; ref=&quot;config&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;/&gt;
...
&lt;xf:submit id=&quot;save&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:label&gt;Save&lt;/xf:label&gt;
&lt;/xf:submit&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that you will need to use &quot;post&quot; not &quot;put&quot; in this example.  The submit element creates a button in your form with the label &quot;Save&quot;.

== Building the Forms Application for the Configuration File ==
There are many ways to &quot;autogenerate&quot; the XForms application that will edit the configuration file in a browser, even if your configuration file is complex and has many repeating elements.

One way is to use a transformation program that transforms an XML Schema to an XForms file.  One example of this is the [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-xformsniem/ NIEM transform].  Although there are other examples of this type of transform, most of these require you to have an XML Schema for your configuration file.  If you do not have an XML Schema there are tools that can generate an XML Schema from one or more instance documents.

If you do not have an XML Schema, you can &quot;draw&quot; your XForms client using commercial XForms tools such as [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/workplace-forms/#N100BD IBM Workplace Forms Designer].  This drag-and-drop environment makes it easy for non-programmers to build and maintain complex forms.

If you are building a form on a budget, then another option is to use the [http://www.orbeon.com/forms/builder Orbeon XForms Builder] which is an XForms application that will build the form for you.

== Client Side Save ==
If you have a secure Intranet you can use the HTTP PUT operator to save your configuration file directly to the web file system.  Sometimes you will need to be able to authenticate a user before you permit the save.  This can be done with a traditional login and session management system or you can create a single script that has the correct permissions.


== Sample Save XQuery ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare namespace xmldb=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/xmldb&quot;;

(: put the collection we want to save our data to here :)
let $my-collection := '/db/config-files'
let $my-config-file-name := 'my-config.xml'

(: get the data we want to update from the HTTP POST :)
let $my-posted-data := request:get-data()

(: make sure we have write access to this collection :)
let $login := collection($my-collection, 'my-userid', 'my-password')

let $store-return-status := xmldb:store($my-collection, $my-config-file-name, $my-posted-data)

(: this is what we return.  You can also return an XHTML file. :)
return
&lt;return&gt;
   &lt;message&gt;File {$my-config-file-name} saved in collection {$my-collection}&lt;/message&gt;
   &lt;result-code&gt;{$store-return-status}&lt;/result-code&gt;
&lt;/return&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In October, General Howe moved to encircle the American Army stationed on northern Manhattan. In response, Washington had the Army retreat off the island, into the Bronx. Howe continued to give chase to the American Army, but Washington responded by halting his army and chose a position near White Plains that he fortified. 
==Battle of White Plains==
Although the British outnumbered the Americans, Howe did not think it was wise to launch an attack on the main American position until they had taken Chatterton Hill, a strategic hill in the area of White Plains Howe decided to send Alexander Leslie and his brigade, along with 3 regiments of Hessians to take the hill. In total, the force numbered about 4,000 men. The British forded the Bronx, and were fired upon by American guns on the other side of the river. 
[[Image:William-howe-fifth-viscount.jpg|thumb|250px|General Lord Howe.]]
The first attempt to take the American positions failed, as they offered stiff resistance. Another attempt was made to take hill, with a Hessian regiment going around the back of the hill to attack the American Flank. As the main assault began to push the Americans back, the Hessian Regiment came in from behind and the Americans retreated, taking their cannon with them.

While the battle was a victory for the British, Howe refused to interfere with the American withdrawal, letting slip yet another opportunity to capture Washington and much of the Continental army and in the process suffering heavier casualties than the Americans.
==Fort Washington==
Instead of continuing to follow Washington north, How turned his army south and decided to launch an attack on the key American Fort, Fort Washington. It was the last American stronghold on the island of Manhattan.

On the morning of November 16, 1776, around 8,000 British and German troops, under the command of Howe, attacked Fort Washington. Although the American garrison put up a fierce struggle, they were forced to surrender when the British and Hessian forces managed to breach their walls with cannon fire. The fall of Fort Washington was a great loss of men and supplies for the American forces. The garrison lost around 53 men killed in action, 96 more wounded, and the rest (totaling 2,818 men) became prisoners of war. Knyphausen reported his casualties at 78 dead and 374 wounded during the storming of the fort.

Four days later, the isolated Fort Lee(located across the river from Fort Washington) was evacuated, leaving behind most of the fort's women, gunpowder and other arms to fall into British hands. With the collapse of both forts, the Hudson River was open from then on to British shipping, leaving the merchant ships and warships to move freely without serious harassment from the Americans. 

==Retreat Across New Jersey==
===Washington's Command in Jeopardy===
Washington had split his army, and turned his Army south and retreated hoping to make a stand in front on Philadelphia. General Charles Lee was in charge of the other group.
[[Image:Charles Lee (general).jpg|thumb|250px|General Charles Lee.]]
Toward the end of 1776, Lee's animosity for Washington began to show. During the retreat from Forts Washington and Lee, he dawdled with his army, and intensified a letter campaign to convince various Congress members that he should replace Washington as Commander-in-Chief. Around this time, Washington was accidentally given and opened a letter from Lee to a Colonel Reed, in which Lee condemned Washington's leadership and abilities, and blamed Washington entirely for the dire straits of the Army. Though he was the victim of the letter, Washington wasn't angry. He was suspicious and disappointed at both Lee and himself, for he (Washington) was a man that took too much responsibility and not enough credit for himself. He sent the letters to Reed and wrote an accompanying letter apologizing for the mistake. Although his army was supposed to join that of Washington's in Pennsylvania, Lee set a very slow pace. On the night of December 12, Lee and a dozen of his guard inexplicably stopped for the night at White's Tavern in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, some three miles from his main army. The next morning, a British patrol of two dozen mounted soldiers found Lee writing letters in his dressing gown, and they captured him. Among the members of the British patrol was Banastre Tarleton. Lee's Army then turned south to regroup with Washington. Lee was eventually recouped by the colonial forces in an exchange for General Richard Prescott.

===Retreat===
Howe sent General Lord Cornwallis to chase Washington's army through New Jersey. Cornwallis continued to chase the Americans until they withdrew across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania in early December. With the campaign at an apparent conclusion for the season, the British entered winter quarters. Although Howe had missed several opportunities to crush the diminishing rebel army, he had killed or captured over 5,000 Americans. He controlled much of New York and New Jersey and was in a good position to resume operations in the spring, with the rebel capital of Philadelphia in striking distance.

{{BookCat}}
And the British were Hoisted by their own Petard: Washington Picked up Kentucky Long Rifles in Pennsylvania, and
his men were better armed with these new rifles. These rifles were hand made by the Pennsylvania Dutch, who were actually 
German craftsmen.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About the Camera node==

[[Image:CameraNode.png|right|thumb|Camera node]]

The camera node is the starting node of any 3D effect. The camera represents the view you are using to see the scene. Use it to choose the point in space you want to view the 3D world from. A scene can have several cameras.

Located in the right hand side of the node, is the camera output button. Pressing it will open a output window displaying the camera view of the scene.

[[Image:CameraOutputWindow.png|center|thumb|Output window]]

==Parameters==

===Projection===
You may wish to choose the projection.

Use the orthographic projection to ...

===Background===
How does a empty 3D scene looks like? If a 3D world is empty the complete camera view is filled by the background. The background of a scene is filled with one color, the background color.

[[Image:CameraBackgroundTab.png|center|thumb|Camera background tab]]

The background color can be selectied by adjusting the sliders or using the Color dialog. Clicking on the color rectangle opens the color dialog.

===Position===
The position tab let you choose a position and orientation for the camera.

[[Image:CameraPositionTab.png|center|thumb|Camera position tab]]

To change the position and orientation of any object in the 3D space you need to know the axis orientation. The center of the camera view is 0.0 on the X and Y axis. To the left of center would be a negative x number. To the right would be a positive x number. Moving towards the top of the screen would be a positive y number, moving to the bottom of the screen would be a negative y number. Moving deeper into the screen is a negative z number, moving towards the viewer would be a positive z number.

Dragging the mouse over a output window showing a camera node controls the camera rotation values.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About the ImagePlane node==
[[Image:ImagePlaneNode.png|right|thumb|ImagePlane node]]
To add an image to the 3D world we need first to associate a plane to the image. The ImagePlane node does that, it represents a 2D plane in the 3D space with a image associated. The image plane can then be manipulated in the same way a plane is manipulated in a 3D space.

The image plane has the same size as the input image.

There are 2 inputs, the first one, in green, accepts a image. The second input connects to any 3D node.

==Parameters==
[[Image:ImagePlaneTab.png|right|thumb|ImagePlane parameters]]
===Scale===
The Image plane can be scale on the x and y axis. To resize an image plane and keep the image aspect ratio just set the same scale values for both x and y scale parameteres.

===Pivot===

The pivot point is the point around which the image plane rotates. By default the pivot value is 0,0, corresponding to the left bottom corner of the image plane. The controls offset the pivot from the left bottom corner.

Press ''Center'' to center the pivot point with the image plane.

==Example==
The example below adds a image to the 3D world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About the Translate node==
[[Image:TranslateNode.png|right|thumb|Translate node]]
The translate node translates all the nodes connected to its output.

==Parameters==
===Translation===
[[Image:TranslateOffsetTab.png|right|thumb|Translation parameters]]

Sets the translation offset along the X, Y and Z axis.

Note that when you translate, you are not moving a set amount from the center of the screen, you are moving a set amount from wherever you currently were on the screen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is just for note taking for projects.
Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; denote the distance from x to the nearest integer for &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1/{10^n} \{10^nx\}&lt;/math&gt;

==e==
First you have to define what log is, &lt;math&gt;log(x)=\int_{1}^{x} 1/t \cdot dt&lt;/math&gt;. Now we have this function log, which is clearly 1-1 for &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0\wedge x\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, so there must be an inverse to it, so there you have e, &lt;math&gt;log^{-1}(x)=e^x\because e^{log(x)}=log(e^{x})=x&lt;/math&gt;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About the Footage node==
[[Image:FootageNode.png|right|thumb|Footage node]]
The footage node is the starting node of any image processing operations. It represents a clip (sequence of frames) and it outputs an image for each different time.

To use the footage node, or any other image node, with 3D nodes you can use the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Nodes Reference/ImagePlane node|ImagePlane node]] which represents a image as a plane in the 3D space.

==Add footage to the node graph==
Adding footage nodes to the node graph is done differently than adding other nodes, ... are a special case of nodes because each footage node have an entry in the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Using the Timeline|timeline]].

To add a footage node to the node graph you need to have [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Managing footage|Footage window]] opened. Footage nodes are created by dragging the chosen footage from Footage window to the node graph window.

Another way of adding footage to the node graph is selecting the footage from the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Managing footage|Footage window]] and click (pic).

When adding a Footage node to the node graph a bar is also added to the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Using the Timeline|timeline]]. This bar represents the footage length (or duration) in time. For each Footage node in the Node Graph an associated bar in the Timeline is created. This means you can have several footage nodes, all referencing the same footage name and all with different timings.

The stating frame of a Footage node can be shifted in time moving the timeline bar back and forward. The footage node can be trimmed and extended. More about the timeline can be found in [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Using the Timeline|Using the Timeline]] chapter.

==Parameters==

===Footage===
[[Image:FootageTab.png|right|thumb|Footage parameters]]
Footage nodes point to footage hold on [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Managing footage|footage window]]. Footage node parameters only have one combo box with the list of all footage available, the same list found on [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Managing footage|footage window]].

This means that footage can be replaced any time of the development of a project and preserve its start and end time, chosen on the timeline. e.g add one frame footage to the node graph, extend it to a desired size, and at a later stage of the project replace that one frame footage with a bigger one.

You can have more than one footage node pointing to the same footage.

[[Image:Haft.jpg|thumb|A mayfly on a person's finger.]]

Mayflies are dainty insects with lacy wings and three long hair-like “tails” which trail behind in flight. They are often called dayflies because of their short lives. The length of adult Mayflies varies from ¼ inch to a little over 1 inch. Their soft bodies may be yellow, green, or brown. Some are black and white. The long, slender Brown Stream Mayfly is golden-brown in color. The Golden Mayfly has a yellow body as well as yellow antennae, legs, and tails. It has brown markings on its head and abdomen.
 
Like all insects, they have 6 legs, 3 body parts, and 2 antennae. They have two short, bristly antennae and their front legs are longer than the back ones. Mayflies are not true flies because they have four wings instead of two. The front wings are held upright when at rest. The hind wings are much smaller than the fore wings. A few of the smaller species lack hind wings altogether. 

Their transparent wings and wispy tails give Mayflies an uncommonly delicate and graceful appearance.
The wings have various markings depending on the species. The Brown Drake Mayfly ''Ephemera simulans'' has spotted wings. The wings of the Golden Mayfly ''Hexagenia'' are clear and lack markings. Young Mayflies have wings that are cloudy in appearance. 

Immature Mayflies are called naiads. Naiads have two forms—flattened and cylindrical. They have long legs and plate-like gills on the sides of the abdomen. They usually have three long thin tail projections and short antennae. Their body color may be green or brown depending on the food they eat. 

Names of Mayfly families often refer to the structure of the larvae. For example, Flat-headed Mayflies have flattened larvae. Their shape is an adaptation to living under rocks or logs in flowing streams. Minnow Mayflies have slender minnow-like larvae.

==Where does it live?==

Mayflies are found in freshwater areas throughout the world. Central [[Wikijunior:Europe/Hungary|Hungary]] is home to one of the largest Mayfly populations. Experts believe there are about three thousand different Mayfly species. About 600 species are found in North America. 

There are about twelve species of common burrowing Mayflies in North America. The larvae are inconspicuous because they burrow in sediment at the bottom of lakes and streams. 

Mayfly naiads can be found at almost any time of the year in clear running water. The flattened forms are attached to rocks or other substrates. The cylindrical forms swim well and prefer flowing or highly oxygenated water.

Mayfly larvae are sensitive to changes in water conditions. Recently, pollution in rivers and streams has caused some species to be endangered or become extinct.

==What does it eat?==

None of the Mayfly species feed during their short adult lives because they have only vestigial mouthparts.

The aquatic immature Mayflies feed by scavenging small pieces of plants or algae that live on rocks under the water.

==How does it defend itself?==

Although Mayflies do not seem to have any defenses, they have survived mostly unchanged for 350 million years. Scientists believe they were around even before the dinosaurs.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

Mayflies have incomplete metamorphosis. Eggs are placed on the surface or underwater by adult females. Immature stages molt (shed exoskeletons) and develop through several stages (instars) before leaving the water. The number of molts depends on the species and is affected by temperature and water conditions. A typical life cycle lasts one year.

When a naiad hatches from an egg, it may live underwater for several years before surfacing to molt into a subimago. This is the in-between stage after the naiad and before the adult. The subimago usually molts into a full-grown adult in a few hours. It has wings like the adult, but is unable to mate. 

Upon reaching the surface of a river or lake, the male subimago pulls itself free from its larval skin which is left floating on the surface. A pair of long filaments trails from the back tip of the abdomen.  In this first winged stage the subimago flutters toward the river bank landing in tree branches where it molts again. The Mayfly is the only insect that molts after reaching the winged stage. The fully adult stage is called the imago. Adults live for a day or two, just long enough to mate and lay eggs.

The males swarm in the air to find females and to mate. They have bifocal eyes to help them in their search. The upper part of each eye is enlarged for spotting females in the air above. The males use their long front legs to grab and hold a female. After mating, the female flies away and the male searches for another mate. The males continue to compete in finding females, swooping and fluttering over the water. 

Within a few hours, the females deposit several hundred eggs while flying low over the water, or by dipping the abdomen on the water surface. Some submerge themselves to lay eggs underwater. Females often die on the water surface as soon as their eggs are laid.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

In a few species, the males assemble in aerial columns several meters high into which the females fly to be mated. Within the hour, successful or not, they are all dead, and their bodies accumulate in piles on the water’s surface.

Some Mayfly species do not even lay their eggs. The whole abdomen with the eggs that it contains simply breaks off and falls into the water. 

Mayflies belong to the order ''Ephemerida''. Their scientific name refers to the very short (ephemeral) lives of adults.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Immature Mayflies are an important food source for fish. Many lures and artificial fishing flies are patterned after them. Anglers call the subimagos “duns” and the imagos “spinners.” 

In general, Mayflies are unnoticed and not considered pests. They do not cause harm to people by transmitting disease or biting. Some problems occur when Mayflies swarm around electric lights at night. Dead Mayflies sometimes cause a foul smell in rivers or lakes.

Emergences of millions of adult Mayflies from the Great Lakes formerly left huge drifts of dead insects on sidewalks in Toledo, Chicago, and Green Bay. These huge hatches disappeared in the 1960s because the lakes had become polluted. Recently Mayfly swarms have reappeared around Lake Erie—a welcome sign that the lake has been cleaned up to healthy levels again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==
[[File:CheliferCancroides1.jpg|thumb|A Pseudoscorpion.]]

Pseudoscorpions have a flat, pear-shaped body.  They have 4 pairs of legs, so they belong to the Class Arachnida.  They look like scorpions but have no tail or stinger.  The short rounded abdomen has twelve segments.  Each segment is protected by a tergite (plate above) and a sternite (plate below). 

Because of their very small size—usually less than ¼ inch long—pseudoscorpions are rarely seen. Members of the largest species, ''Garypus titanius'', grow to about ½ inch long.  

Most pseudoscorpions have 2 to 4 simple eyes. ''Albiorix anophthalmus'' is reported to be the only eyeless species. 

Their legs have 5 to 7 segments. Their long pedipalps (pincer-like claws) are similar to the pincers on a scorpion. There are no “teeth” on the pedipalps. Most species have venom glands and release venom from the pedipalps.

The body colors of most pseudoscorpions vary from yellowish-tan to dark brown. Sometimes red or olive tinges and dark markings can be seen. Adults of the eyeless species ''A. anophthalmus'' are light brown to tan with a gray area across the upper abdomen. 

Members of the Chernetidae family are very small ranging from 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch long. They have 5 segments on their legs and are usually tan to dark brown.

Like spiders, pseudoscorpions have silk glands. The duct openings are located on the chelicerae (jaws).

==Where does it live?==

In North America there are over 350 pseudoscorpion species. About 2,500 species are known worldwide. They live in cold regions like Northern Ontario and above the timberline in the Rocky Mountains. They are most abundant and diverse in warm tropical regions. They are found beneath tree bark, in tree hollows, and in leaf litter. Some species live in the soil. Others live under stones, in cracks of rocks, and in caves. A few species live at the seashore. 

Members of the species ''Chelifer cancroides'' are commonly found in homes, where they live in between pages of books. They are sometimes found trapped in bathtubs and sinks. 

The largest species, ''Garypus titanius'', lives in the middle of the southern Atlantic Ocean on Ascension Island.

Members of the rare eyeless species ''A. anophthalmus'' live in areas of complete darkness inside caves where temperature and humidity remain constant. They hide under small pieces of broken limestone scattered throughout the interior of the cave. This species has so far been discovered only in Arkenstone Cave in Pima County, Arizona.

==What does it eat?==

Many pseudoscorpion species eat insects and small invertebrates. The cave-dwelling ''A. anophthalmus'' is part of a complex food chain. It eats small invertebrates which feed on mold that grows on cricket guano.

The common household species ''C. cancroids'' eats booklice and dust mites. It sometimes feeds on mites that live underneath wing covers of certain beetles.

Most species in the Family Chernetidae have a varied diet. They feed on small flies, bark lice, caterpillars, butterflies, ants, mites, and small earthworms .

==How does it defend itself?==

In the growing stages, a silken cocoon provides good protection from enemies. As adults, pseudoscorpions can move quickly and easily in all directions to escape predators. Most species have venom glands and release venom from the claw-like pedipalps.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

A pseudoscorpion goes through 3 molts over the course of several years before it becomes an adult. The young usually grow inside a small, protective, silken cocoon. They live 2 to 3 years after reaching adulthood. Members of some species can live up to 4 years. 

In most species, the female has a brood pouch that remains attached to her abdomen. Hatchlings stay in the pouch and feed on a milk-like liquid from her ovaries. In some species, the female abandons the pouch leaving her embryos to develop unattended.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

Pseudoscorpions can clamp onto the leg of a fly or beetle to hitch a ride from habitat to habitat. Hitching a ride on a larger insect is known as phoresy.

They have silk glands and use silk to spin cocoons in which to molt. Silken cocoons also provide shelter during the cold winter months.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Because of their secretive nature and very small size, pseudoscorpions are rarely noticed by people.  They are often mistaken for either ticks or small spiders. Pseudoscorpions are neither dangerous nor destructive. They pose no hazard for homeowners.

[[Image:House_Dust_Mite.jpg|thumb|A dust mite.]]

Like all arachnids, mites have pincer-like mouthparts, four pairs of legs, and no antennae. Their two main body segments are fused together to make one large segment. Their color and body shape vary. They range in size from 1/64 inch to 1/8 inch. 

All mites belong to the Order Acari. Scientists have described over 45,000 species of mites. Experts believe only 5% of all the different kinds of mites have been found. 

Chigger mites are brownish or reddish in color. Some have a velvety surface. Their oval bodies are sometimes slightly pinched in the middle. They often have long hairs on the body and legs. There are 3000 species of chigger mites (family trombiculidae).

There are about 650 known species of spider mites (family tetranychidae). The color of these mites can be orange, red, green, or yellow. They have soft, rounded or pear-shaped bodies covered with fine pale hairs. 

There are 120 species of scabies mites (family sarcoptidae). Also known as mange mites, they are small in size and pale brown in color. They have slightly flat round bodies with fine wrinkles and long fine hairs. They have short stout legs.

Adult housedust mites (family pyroglyphidae) are creamy blue in color and have a striped pattern on a rectangular shaped body. 

Red velvet mites (family trombidiidae) can be as large as 1/16 inch long. The soft oval-shaped body is completely covered with a coat of fine red hairs. The front pair of legs is set forward like antennae. Hidden between a pair of stout palps are sharp mouth parts.

==Where does it live?==
Mites are found in various habitats throughout the world. Many species live outdoors in soil, leaf litter, and animal burrows. Others live on plants and animals. There are hundreds of species of mites that feed on bees inside hives.
 
Mites prefer warm moist surroundings. Beds, carpet and upholstery support high mite populations. Spider mites live in plants, trees, and shrubs. Scabies mites live in the skin or hair follicles of mammals, including humans.
 
Velvet mites are numerous in tropical regions. They are found in or on soil from savannas to forests. They often live in the litter of forest floors. Two-spotted spider mites are found in gardens, orchards, and greenhouses. Water mites live in ponds and slow streams. They crawl on immersed vegetation or swim through the water

==What does it eat?==
A favorite food of mites is human and animal dander (skin flakes). Most species of scabies mites leave tunnels when feeding on the epidermis (outer layer of skin). Chigger mites parasitize (feed on) humans, animals, reptiles, and birds. 

Although red velvet mites appear to be sluggish, fluffy creatures, adults are actually voracious predators. They are capable of attacking and eating prey many times their size. Young red velvet mites are parasites on grasshoppers, locusts, and crickets. 

Spider mites infest and feed on a wide range of plants. Two-spotted spider mites eat soft tissue and juice of American elm trees and house plants. House dust mites are not parasitic since they only eat dead tissue.

==How does it defend itself?==
Their small size allows mites to go unnoticed in dark places inside houses and on plants. They burrow into host surfaces and into soil where they are hidden from predators. 

Spider mites live under leaves where they make protective webs. Two-spotted spider mite males shoot silk to ward off competitors.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
Some mites give birth to living young, but most mite species lay eggs. Newly hatched young are called larvae. The larvae have only six legs. They grow two more legs after the first molt. Then they are known as nymphs.
 
Scabies mites mate on the skin of animal and human hosts. The eggs are laid in tunnels in the hosts’ skin. Females lay up to fifty eggs during their lifetime. Upon hatching, the young find shelter and food in hair follicles.

Chigger mites lay eggs in damp soil. The larvae climb grass blades to find passing hosts. While in the first stage, larvae feed on skin of mammals, birds, and reptiles. Later they penetrate the skin with sawlike chelicerae (jaws) to find fluid and tissue under the skin. When fully fed the larva drops off, molts, and finds small arthropods for prey.

Adult velvet mites come up from under the soil to mate and lay eggs. This often happens after a heavy rain. Some larvae feed on insects, such as grasshoppers while others feed on arthropods.

Varroa mites lay eggs in honeycomb cells where bees develop. The nymphs feed on bee larvae. When they become adults, they attach themselves to adult bees. They do this in order to feed and as a way of dispersing to other places.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
The tropical species Archegozetes longisetosus can lift over 1000 times its own weight. 

Spider mites produce silk from glands at the front of their bodies. 

Varroa destructor mites cannot reproduce unless they are inside a honey bee colony.

==How does this bug affect people?==
Dust mites are harmless to most people. They do not carry disease but they leave behind droppings that can cause allergic reactions. Symptoms can range from itchy eyes to asthma attacks. Unlike other kinds of mites, house dust mites are not considered parasites since they eat dead tissue.

Infestation by sarcoptes scabie mites causes extreme itching. Scratching leads to hair loss and infection. Sarcoptes scabie mites are the most common cause of mange.
 
Many spider mites are significant pests. They damage grasses and other plants. Infestations can seriously affect crops such as wheat, fruit, clover, cotton, and coffee. They cover plant parts with fine webbing causing the leaves to discolor and wither. Other pests that harm plants are thread-footed mites and gall mites.

Chigger mite bites cause severe itching, dermatitis, and allergic reactions. A few species transfer disease to humans.

Varroa destructor is a parasitic mite that attacks honey bees. It causes a disease called varroatosis. When it attaches to the bee’s body to suck juices, it spreads a virus that causes deformation of the bee’s wings. A serious mite infestation can cause an entire honey bee colony to die.

Many mite species are helpful to people. They attack insects and eat aphid eggs and roundworms.

== Toyota Prius ==
It is relatively easy to turn a [[w:Toyota Prius|Prius]] into a well-performing pure EV.

One would start with a 2004+ Prius with a worn-out or destroyed engine, but intact [[w:transaxle|transaxle]].  Remove the engine and [[wikt:gear|gear]] the transaxle's engine input [[wikt:shaft|shaft]] to the output shaft, possibly with a [[w:cogbelt|cogbelt]].  This is to turn the engine input shaft at a speed (e.g. 500 rpm @ 60 miles per hour or 97 km/h) that prevents MG1 from overspeeding when driving at highway speeds (above 62 miles per hour or 100 km/h ) while making [[w:MG1|MG1]]'s output power available to help drive and stop the vehicle.

With [[w:MG2|MG2]] rated at 50 kW output and MG1 rated at at least 25 kW, one could potentially provide up to 75 kW to the wheels for acceleration as an EV, only slightly less than the 82 kW peak available as a hybrid.  One could remove the 21 kW DC:DC converter between the battery and
motors, and instead provide a battery pack with a peak charging voltage of 500V.  The motors and high power drive electronics could be used as is.  It would hopefully be possible to bypass all the hybrid system logic and use only the motor driver circuits; otherwise, they would have
to be replaced.

[[w:Electrovaya|Electrovaya]] makes a 48V Li-ion module that stores 1.6 kWh and weighs 9.5 kg (21 lb).  A 1P9S/2P9S/3P9S, 433V, pack would hold 11.4/23.0/34.6 kWh to 80% [[w:DOD|DOD]] and weigh 188/376/564 [[w:lb|lb]].  One of these packs would add just -112/76/264 lb to the vehicle after removal of an estimated 300 lb of OEM battery, engine, and related components -- and would provide an estimated 57/115/170 miles of EV range. The battery cost, however, would be US$17k/$35k/$52k at an estimated $1200 per kWh-capacity.

A 1P33S pack of 12V, 30Ah Gold Peak NiMH modules would add 324 lb to the vehicle's weight, store 9.5 kWh to 80% DOD and weight 624 lb.  It would add 324 lb and would provide an estimated 48 miles of EV range.  At an estimated $1200 per kWh-capacity, the pack would cost $14.3k

In contrast, fuel savings at $0.10/kWh vs. $4.50/gallon would be $0.075/mile or only $11k over 150,000 miles at today's prices, well below the cost of even the 48 EV mile battery pack.

=== Genset trailer and external PHEV ===
For long trips and extended range, one can put the Prius´ internal combustion engine  and fuel tank in a [[w:genset trailer|genset trailer]], becoming an external [[w:plug-in hybrid electric vehicle|plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to put systems in place to avoid the problem of concurrent users writing over each other changes.

Consider the following scenario.  Bob loads the data to a configuration file into his client XForms application, makes half of his changes and then goes out to lunch before he does a save back to the server.  During lunch Alice opens the same data in her XForms client, makes some changes, and does a save.  When Bob gets back from lunch he does a save on the same data and wipes out all of Alice's updates.

This is known as the &quot;Lost Update Problem&quot; and is common when you have many users that may be concurrently editing the same data.

== Two Strategies for Managing Client Locks ==
There are many strategies to solve this problem, and each of them have some design limitations.

In general you will find two separate locking strategies which can be used together or independently:

The first strategy is to do checksums on the data when you move the data to the client.  When you save, you recalculate the checksum on the data and make sure it has not changed.  You can also put the last modified timestamp in the client and warn the user if the file has changed since they started editing it.  The '''etag''' element within the HTML header is frequently used to hold an md5 checksum of the data.

The second strategy is to set some state on the server when a resource is edited and provide reasonable timeouts if the user does not do a save.  This method is always more complex because you must deal with unlocking resources and this often involves tools and reports to view locked files.

The strategy presented here is to place a lock on the file when an Edit form is used and unlock the file when a save is performed.

eXist provides some simple functions to lock a file.  This lock can be used to prevent the second user from opening up an edit session.  The drawback to this approach is that if a file is locked and the user does not do a save, then a tool must be created to permit records to be manually unlocked.

== eXist Locking Functions ==
Here are some of the locking functions you can use on eXist:

 &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;util:exclusive-lock($a as node()*, $b as item()*) item()*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
 Puts an &lt;b&gt;exclusive&lt;/b&gt; lock on the owner documents of all nodes in the first argument $a. Then evaluates the expressions
 in the second argument $b and releases the acquired locks aftertheir completion.

 &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;util:shared-lock($a as node()*, $b as item()*) item()*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
 Puts a &lt;b&gt;shared&lt;/b&gt; lock on the owner documents of all nodes in the first argument $a. Then evaluates the expressions
 in the second argument $b and releases the acquired locks aftertheir completion.

 &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;xmldb:document-has-lock($a as xs:string, $b as xs:string) xs:string?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
 Returns the name of the user that holds a write lock on the resource specified in $b in the collection $a.
 If no lock is in place, the empty sequence is returned. The collection can be passed as a simple collection path or an XMLDB URI.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Selection of the SAR candidate dog is critical for both dog and handler success. While no selection method will be 100% accurate at selecting dogs who will be successful in SAR, the chances of wash-outs are greatly reduced by appropriate screening. Screening should be carried out at puppy selection (generally at 8 weeks) and then again at 1 yr of age. The primary concerns during candidate screening are the presence of appropriate drives (particularly [[w:Prey_drive|prey]] and [[w:Food_drive|food]] drives), tractability, temperament, and tenacity (&quot;work ethic&quot;). Extreme [[w:Defense_drive|defensiveness]] (&quot;civility&quot;) is a disqualifying characteristic, although well-trained dogs of steady temperament with natural defensive drive, a common trait in working breeds such as the GSD and Malinois, may make excellent working dogs.

'''Testing Prey Drive'''

Search and rescue training relies heavily on two drives: prey drive (the tendency to chase a moving object), and hunt drive (the tendency to search or &quot;hunt&quot; for an object when it stops moving and disappears from sight).  Prey drive is easily tested for by tying a toy or small towel onto the end of a string and dragging it across the ground in quick jerky movements.

'''Testing Distractibility'''

Testing for &quot;distractibility&quot; is an excellent way of predicting good work ethic in a puppy or older dog.  Dogs that are easily distracted lack the ability to focus on a task for long periods of time.  Although focus can be improved through training, some dogs are inherently more distractible and will struggle with this throughout their careers.  Even in 7 and 8 week old puppies differences in their ability to focus can be seen and tested for.

Perform this test when the pup/dog is hungry.  Using a smelly treat such as a piece of chicken or hotdog, show the treat to the pup and let him/her taste/lick it but do not let him have it.  Hold it in your closed fist and let the pup smell it, lick your hand, and in general try to get it from you.  This should be done while other people are moving about, littermates are playing nearby, etc.  Note how long the pup will remain focused, trying to obtain the treat, even with distractions going on all around.

For the second part of the test let the pup watch you toss the treat into some grass or leaves some distance away.  Make sure the pup sees the treat as it is tossed.  Release him and note how long he continues to search for the food.  If he finds it easily, repeat the test making it more difficult (longer distance, taller grass).  This is also testing for &quot;hunt drive&quot; but the addition of distractions gives a good measure of the distractibility of the pup.

Ideally we want to choose the dog or puppy that will chase a moving object, grab it, pick it up (often shaking or &quot;killing&quot; it), and then return with the object to the tester without becoming distracted.  On the food test we want the dog to remain focused on the food ignoring the distractions, and to continue to attempt to obtain the food without giving up.  When the treat is thrown the dog should hunt continuously until he finds it, then return to the tester looking for more.  

It is also important that a search dog be able to withstand physical discomfort. In addition to mental and physical exertion, the dog will likely need to navigate thick brush, snow and ice, and other obstacles that may cause physical discomfort. A reasonable degree of pain tolerance is thus desirable in the search dog. In puppies, some idea of this may be ascertained by pinching the webbing between the toes of the puppy. A puppy with little tolerance for this discomfort may turn into a dog that balks at going through brush or that is incapacitated by minor scratches.

While it is rare to find a dog or puppy who fits this &quot;ideal&quot; portrait, the closer he comes to it the greater his potential as an extraordinary search dog will be.

At the same time we are watching how the dog/pup interacts with other dogs, puppies and people.  He should show great desire to be with any and all people, and should not be overly bossy or dominant with littermates or other dogs.  While the dog that hides under the coffee table or sits in the back of the pen, fearful to come out, may tug at our heartstrings, this is not the one we want to choose to train for search work.  Neither do we want the puppy who is constantly bowling over, snarling at and pushing around his littermates, or the one who growls when a person approaches him, his food bowl or toy.  

He should be friendly, outgoing and curious, and should not become overly worried when placed in a new environment or when exposed to new people, dogs, noises, sensations, etc.  If startled he should recover quickly, endeavoring to investigate whatever it was that startled him.  He should not show fear or aggression with new dogs or people.

'''Testing for Sound Sensitivity/Surprise'''

A puppy can be tested for excessive &quot;softness&quot; of temperament in relation to surprise noises by creating a loud noise and watching the puppy's reaction. For example, while one person is playing with the puppy, have another throw a metal dog bowl onto the floor. A puppy with good temperament in this regard will startle but not spook, immediately recovering and expressing curiosity for the source of the noise. Some puppies may not startle at all. Puppies that &quot;spook&quot;, becoming fearful or running away, may not be appropriate SAR candidates. Keep in mind that it is important to accustom any dog to various noise environments. Even a dog that tests well as described should still be gradually exposed to as many noises as possible, including e.g. televisions, radios, music, vehicles, loud animal noises, gun shots, etc.

A few caveats: puppies that have been kept too long with littermates often become dependent upon them and will have a difficult time separating.  Puppies should not remain with littermates past 8-12 wks of age without also receiving a lot of individual time alone and with people and other dogs.  Obtaining two puppies from the same litter is not recommended; better to get two pups separated in age by a few months, who do not know each other.  Also, older pups or dogs who have not been socialized and taken places may not be able to adjust well to a job that requires them to be constantly exposed to new experiences and environments.

While puppies and dogs that do not test out well, or who show some of the problems indicated above may beat the odds and become good search dogs, they will almost certainly require a great deal of extra time and energy to fix these things- time and energy that would better spent on training them to do their job.  In all likelihood they will still never be as good at their job as dogs without these issues.  When someone's life is on the line it is essential that we provide the most highly trained, focused and motivated search dogs possible.

A number of comprehensive working puppy evaluation systems are currently in use in the working dog community and may be appropriate for selecting SAR dogs. Examples include Jack and Wendy Volhard's [http://www.volhard.com/puppy/pat.htm Puppy Aptitude Test (PAT)] and the [http://www.malinut.com/ref/write/paws/ PAWS Working Dog Evaluation] PAWS Working Dog Evaluation (PAWS stands for Possessiveness, Attention, Willingness, and Strength) as well as one modified from the Federal Emergency Management Agency canine testing (FEMA US&amp;R/Disaster Dog) at  [http://www.pawsoflife.org/pdf/PoLBasicTest.doc the Paws of Life Foundation Temperament Test]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Conditionals implement decision points in a computer program.
Suppose you have a program that performs some task on an
image. You may well have a point in the program where you
doe one thing if the image is a JPEG and quite another
thing if the image is a GIF file. Likely, at this point,
your program will include a conditional expression to make
this decision.

Before learning about conditionals, it is important to
learn about logical expressions. Such expressions are the
core of conditionals and loops&lt;ref&gt;
We will learn about loops in the next chapter.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Logical expressions ==

A logical expression evaluates to a truth value, in essence true or
false. For example, the expression x &gt; 0 resolves to true if x is positive
and false if x is negative or zero. In Sway, truth is represented by
the symbol :true and falsehood by the symbol :false. Together,
these two symbols are known as ''Boolean'' values.


One can assign truth values to variables:

      var z = c &gt; 0;

Here, the variable z has a value of :true if c is positive;
otherwise it has a value of :false.

== Logical operators ==

Sway has the following logical operators.
 
    ==  equal to
    &gt;=  greater than or equal to
    &gt;   greater than
    &lt;=  less than or equal to
    !=  not equal to
    &amp;&amp;  and
    ||  or

The first five operators are used for comparing two things,
while the last two operators are the glue that joins up simpler
logical expressions into more complex ones.

== Short circuiting ==

When evaluating a logical expression,
Sway evaluates the expression from left to right and
stops evaluating as soon as it finds out that the expression
is definitely true or definitely false.
For example, when encountering the expression

      x != 0 &amp;&amp; y/x &gt; 2

if x has a value of 0, the subexpression on the left side of the &amp;&amp;
connective resolves to false. At this point, there is no way for the
entire expression to be true (since both the left hand side and the right
hand side must be true for an &amp;&amp; expression to be true), so the right
hand side of the expression is not evaluated. Note that this expression
protects against a divide-by-zero error.

There are two basic constructs for selecting among alternatives in
Sway. They are the if-then-else statement and the switch (or case)
statement.

== If expressions ==

Sway's ''if'' expressions are used to conditionally execute code,
depending on the truth value of what is known as the
''test'' expression. One version of ''if'' has a block of
code following the test expression:

Here is an example:

    if (name == &quot;John&quot;)
        {
        println(&quot;What a great name you have!&quot;);
        }

In this version, if the test expression is true (i.e., 
the string &quot;John&quot; is bound to the variable ''name''), 
then the following ''block'' is executed (i.e., the compliment
is printed). If the test expression is false, the following
block is not executed.

Unlike most programming languages, Sway's ''if'' is a function.
In the above example, the two arguments are the test expression
and the following block. The following block is known as a 
''proximal'' block.

Here is another form of ''if'':

    if (major == &quot;Computer Science&quot;)
        {
        println(&quot;Smart choice!&quot;);
        }
    else
        {
        println(&quot;Ever think about changing your major?&quot;);
        }

In this version, ''if'' takes three arguments: the test expression
and the two following blocks&lt;ref&gt;
The ''else'' is there for looks only and is known as 'syntactic
sugar'.
&lt;/ref&gt;.
As before, the first block is evaluated if the test expression
is true. If the test expression is false, however,
the second block is evaluated instead.

Be aware that any proximal arguments must be blocks.
Although the following is legal in some languages,
a syntax error will be generated in Sway:

    if (name == &quot;John&quot;)
        println(&quot;What a great name you have!&quot;); //not a block!

Since wrapping a single expression in a block can be considered
tedious,
you may dispense with the proximal blocks and use regular function
call syntax for ''if'':

    if (a &lt; b,min = a,min = b);   //find the minimum of two numbers

The above is equivalent to:

    if (a &lt; b)
        {
        min = a;
        }
    else
        {
        min = b;
        }

Note that if you move expressions inside as regular arguments,
you will need a semicolon
after the close parenthesis, as with any other function call.

The function ''if'' has a return value, as does any other function 
in Sway.
Indeed, you can use the return value to simplify the above expression:

    min = if (a &lt; b) { a; } else { b; };

or

    min = if (a &lt; b,a,b);

If you use the return value of an if, you must end the expression with
a semicolon, regardless of whether you use proximal blocks or not.

Remember, if you use an ''if'' by itself and the if has proximal
blocks, do not follow the expression with a semicolon. Otherwise
a semicolon is needed at the end of the entire expression containing
the ''if''.

== if chains ==

You can chain ''if expressions'' together, as in:

    if (bases == 4) { println(&quot;HOME RUN!!!&quot;); }
    else if (bases == 3) { println(&quot;Triple!!&quot;); }
    else if (bases == 2) { println(&quot;double!&quot;); }
    else if (bases == 1) { println(&quot;single&quot;); }
    else { println(&quot;out&quot;); }

As before, the value of the block that is eventually evaluated is
the return value of the entire construct. If no block is evaluated,
the return value is :false.

What is the difference between chained ''if''s and a sequence of
unchained ''if''s? For example,

    if (bases == 4) { println(&quot;HOME RUN!!!&quot;); }
    if (bases == 3) { println(&quot;Triple!!&quot;); }
    if (bases == 2) { println(&quot;double!&quot;); }
    if (bases == 1) { println(&quot;single&quot;); }
    else { println(&quot;out&quot;); }

The answer is left as an exercise for the reader.

==Switch expressions==

The above if-chain can be rewritten using a ''switch'' expression:

   var x = 0;
   
   switch (x)
       {
       case(4) { println(x,&quot;HOME RUN!!!&quot;); }
       case(3) { println(&quot;Triple!!&quot;); }
       case(2) { println(&quot;double!&quot;); }
       case(1) { println(&quot;single&quot;); }
       else    { println(&quot;out&quot;); }
       }

If the switch expression, in this case ''x'',  matches any of 
the case expressions, in this case 4, 3, 2, and 1, then the block
following the matching case is evaluated.

In languages like C, the switch statement is more efficient
than an equivalent if-chain. In Sway, not so much. In fact,
the switch is equivalently (un)-efficient, but often more
pleasing to the eye. Unlike C, which requires the switch
and case
expressions to be integral and known at compile time,
Sway's switch is much more flexible, in that both
kinds of expressions can be any valid Sway expression,
including variables.

To use ''switch'', you will need to include the '''''basics''''' library.
To use the &quot;basics&quot; library, add the function call:

    include(&quot;basics&quot;);

at the top of your source code file.

As with ''if'', switch is a function with proximal block arguments.
By itself, a call to switch with a proximal block does not have
a terminating semicolon
As with ''if'', switch is a function with proximal block arguments.
By itself, a call to switch with a proximal block does not have
a terminating semicolon. In all other cases, s semicolon will be needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is the Timeline==
While the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Using the Node Graph|node graph]] allows you to arrange and adjust the nodes that comprise your composite, the timeline window provides a visual representation of the timing for each frame of a [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Nodes Reference/Footage node|footage node]]. The timeline lets the user position footage nodes in time as do some holding and trimming adjustments to footage nodes. The figure below illustrates the correspondence of the footage nodes with the timeline.

[[Image:FootageNodesTimeline.png|center|thumb|420px|Footage nodes and correspondent timeline bars]]

This chapter covers how to navigate the timeline window, and how to make adjustments to the timing parameters of each [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Nodes Reference/Footage node|footage node]].

==Timeline window==

===Play bar===
The play bar, at the top of the timeline window, and the play head, provide information about the progress and the working frame. The figure below illustrates the play bar and play head. 

[[Image:TimelineWindow.png|center|thumb|320px|Timeline window]]

The play Bar can be used to control the playback and facilitate the playhead navigation. Clicking with the mouse within the play bar moves the play head to the clicked position. It's also possible to control the playback speed and direction by interactively scrubbin the mouse across the play bar.

===Playback range===
The timeline shows a area in gray to represent the playback range. The playback range is set on the [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Main_window#Player_toolbar|player toolbar]].

[[Image:WorkingTime.png|center|thumb|320px|Timeline playback range]]

Note that the timeline length grows as footage is dragged to the right.

===Tooltips===

Clips (or bars) in the timeline show a tool tip if the mouse is left unmovable over a clip. The tool tip gives several information about the specific clip.

''First frame at'' represents the number of the actual start frame of the clip. The frame number in which the bar starts and the timeline frame in which the bar ends.

''Hold first frame'' or ''Hold last frame'' holds the first or last frame of the clip for the specified amount of frames. You can think on holding a frame as repeating the first or last frame at the begin or end of the clip.

The ''Trim In'' means the number of frames removed from the start and ''Trim Out'' specify the number of frames removed from the end of the clip. The values used here are offsets. A value of 5 in ''Trim In'' would use the 5th frame in the sequence as the start, ignoring the first four frames. A value of 95 would stop loading frames after the 95th.

==Manipulating clips==

As said before, the timeline lets you view and arrange the timing of your footage nodes. Each footage node has an instance in the timeline displayed as horizontal bar.

===Adjust clip's start time===
The duration of a clip is determined by the length of the correspondent bar in the timeline. Where the clip starts and ends is represented by the begin and end of the horizontal bar. To adjust the start time of a clip just move the correspondent clip's bar. Timeline bars only move horizontally.

===Holding and trimming===

[[Image:TimelineFrameHolding.png|right|thumb|170px|Holding the last frame]]

Holding and trimming are techniques to change the clip duration. Trimming consists of cutting frames from the original clip, and holding is used to extend the clip.

Footage bars have 2 handlers, in the form of arrows, at their ends. These handlers are used to adjust the length of the clip. You can trim frames off of the beginning or the end of a clip by adjusting the left or right handler.

To increase the duration of a clip, by holding the last frame, drag the right handle to the right. The clip’s duration extends as you pull the handle to the right or left. Note that the original clip size has a different color than trimmed/hold frames at the bar ends.

If the left handler at the beginning of the bar is dragged to the left the newly extended area of the clip, in a lighter color, represents the duration of the clip that has been expanded by freezing the first frame.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
Sometimes, a programmer wishes to execute a section of code multiple
times. This kind of task is commonly performed using a loop.
The most
basic loop structure in Sway is the ''while'' loop, whose format is...

    whileloop: 'while' '(' expr ')' block

where ''expr'' is any Sway expression that resolves to the
symbols :true or :false.

A ''while'' loop tests its condition before the body of the loop is
executed. If the initial test fails, the body is not executed at all. For
example;

    var i = 10;
    while (i &lt; 10)
        {
        print(i);
        i = i + 1;
        }

never prints out anything since the test immediately fails. In this example,
however:

    var i = 0;
    while (i &lt; 10)
        {
        print(i);
        i = i + 1;
        }


the loop prints out the digits 0 through 9:

    0123456789
    
A ''while'' loop executes its body (the block portion of the loop)
repeatedly (as long as the condition remains true).

To write an infinite loop, use :true as the test expression:

    while (:true)
        {
        var i = getInput();
        process(i);
        }

== Loops are function calls ==

As with ''if'', all Sway loops are function calls, usually
with proximal block arguments. If desired, small proximal
blocks can be moved inside the parentheses as regular arguments.
Also, the semicolon rule for ''if'' applies to loops as well:
A loop, by itself, having a proximal block argument is not
followed by semicolon. If you were to use the return
value of a loop (for while, it is :true if the test expression
was initially true and :false if the test expression was
initially false), you would need to terminate the entire 
expression with a semicolon.

== Other loops ==

Because loops are so easy to write in Sway, only the while loop
is built-in. Other loops can be found in the &quot;basics&quot; library.
To use the &quot;basics&quot; library, add the function call:

    include(&quot;basics&quot;);

at the top of your source code file.

=== do-until ===

The ''do-until'' loop is similar to the ''while'' loop, but the body
of the loop is executed once before the test is made. For example:

    var i = 10;
    do-until (i == 10) //note the test
        {
        print(i);
        i = i + 1;
        }

prints out the value of ''i'' once:

    10

Note that the do-until runs until the test succeeds, which is
the opposite of the while, which runs until the test fails.

The ''do-until'' loop is not used very often,
though sometimes it is useful for processing interactive input.
You can always write a ''do-until'' as a ''while'' loop. Consider
this loop:

    do-until (r == 0)
        {
        r = n / d;
        n = d;
        d = r;
        }

It can be rewritten as a ''while'' loop thusly...

    finished = :false;
    while (!finished)
        {
        r = n / d;
        n = d;
        d = r;
        finished = (r == 0);
        }

Note that the variable ''finished'', being initialized to :false,
ensures that the body of the loop is entered at least once.
At the bottom of the loop, ''finished'' is set to the 
''do-until'' test result.

Usually, the ''do-until'' is easier to read and understand.

=== for loops ===

Another loop found in many programs is the ''for'' loop.
The ''for'' loop is composed of four major parts:

*the initialization step
*the test
*the body
*the update

Note that these components correspond exactly to a while loop

    i = 0;                        // initialize
    while (i &lt; MAX)               // test
        {                         // body
        inspect(i);
        i = i + 1;                // update (in body)
        } 

with the update usually being the last statement in
the loop body. The corresponding ''for'' loop is:

    for (i = 0, i &lt; MAX, i = i + 1)  // init, test, update
        {                            // body
        inspect(i);
        }

See how the update has been moved out of the body.

For loops are commonly used to sweep through each element of an array:

     for (i = 0, i &lt; length(items), i = i + 1)
         {
         a[i] = b[i] * c[i]; 
         }


The ''for'' loop is a counting loop.
With most, but not all,
counting loops,
the loop
variable (in this case ''i'')
is initialized to zero and the loop test
(in this case &lt;tt&gt;i &lt; length(items)&lt;/tt&gt;)
is configured to succeed
as long as the loop variable is
strictly less than maximum of the count.
If the loop body is to be executed ''n'' times,
then the loop would look something like:

    for (i = 0, i &lt; n, i = i + 1)
        {
        ...
        }

This convention
stems from the fact that arrays in Sway
(detailed in a later chapter)
use 'zero-based indexing'. That is to say,
the first element of an array is located at index
zero, the second at index one and so on.

You should always use this convention unless there is
good reason not to&lt;ref&gt;
Just trust me on this one.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== for-each loops ===

The ''for-each'' loop is also useful for sweeping through arrays and lists. It does so without explicitly counting, however:

    for-each (s,items)
        {
        inspect(s);
        }

In this loop, each element in ''items'' is bound to the variable
''s'', in turn. The loop body executes as many times as there
are elements in the array or list. Note how much shorter the
''for-each'' loop is compared to the equivalent ''for'' loop:

    for (i = 0; i &lt; length(item); i = i + 1)
        {
        var s = items[i];
        inspect(s);
        }

which explicitly counts.

== Leaving loops ==

There are
numerous ways to leave a loop, besides having the
loop condition or test failing (or succeeding in the case of
the ''do-until''). It is possible to return from a function
even if in the middle of  a loop. This technique is often
used when searching an array:

    function find(x,items)
        {
        var s;
        
        for-each(s,items)
            {
            if (x == s)
                {
                return :true;
                }
            }
            
        :false;
        }

Note that if the item isn't found, the loop eventually terminates
and failure is noted by returning :false.

You can also leave a loop without leaving the function completely
by calling ''break'':

    i = 0;
    while (i &lt; 10)
        {
        if (i &gt; 5) { break(); }
        inspect(i);
        }
    println(:done);

Running this code yields:

    i is 0
    i is 1
    i is 2
    i is 3
    i is 4
    i is 5
    done

You will need to include '''''basics''''' to use ''break''. You could also
just throw an exception of type :break instead:

    i = 0;
    while (i &lt; 10)
        {
        if (i &gt; 5) { throw(:break,0); }
        inspect(i);
        }
    println(:done);

Finally, you can leave a loop by leaving the program via the
''exit'' function:

    while (1)
        {
        var input = getInput();
        if (reallyBad(input))
            {
            exit(-1);            //non-zero exit code
            }
        }

By convention, Sway programs that exit with code of zero
means processing went normally. A non-zero exit code
indicates that some sort of fatal error occurred.

''Mechanical vibration is defined as the measurement of a periodic process of oscillations with respect to an equilibrium point. This book should provide essential concepts involving vibrational analysis, uncertainty modeling, and vibration control. It should also give a good fundamental basis in computational results, mathematical modeling and assessment in performance of different systems and system components. Attention will be paid to vibrating systems such as beams, strings, plates and membranes, vibration isolation, critical speeds, the balancing of rotating and reciprocating machinery. Basic principles of control theory will be presented from feedback control systems. Finally, chapters will include numerous example problems and possibly projects.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Distinguishing Mechanical Vibration ==

In regards to the subject of this book, when referring to mechanical systems we are implying systems such as compressors, pumps and other machines. When referring to structures we are implying buildings, space craft and other large scale objects. A most intuitive differential is simply that mechanical systems are ones that we use, whereas a structural system is one that we can physically enter. Although there are clearly many cases where a studied system can be categorized as both, this book will mainly focus on the more mechanical aspects of vibration; but most of the beginning conceptual formations are identical. I also want to note that there are similarities between vibrational theorems and analysis and acoustical; initially viewed as separate but they overlap considerably within some mathematical and conceptual subject.

This book is intended to act as a guide for an undergraduate mechanical engineer. There will be references and explanation to core principles, regardless of whether or not they fall out of range in Vibrational Analysis. We will attempt to minimalize the amount of extraneous learning material within this text, but it is never a bad idea to offer a refresher lesson when working with all too often forgetable scientific and mathematical complexities. 

''Can you quickly recall the Taylor Series expansion for a function of two variables?''

This textbook aims to offer a balance of both learned material and material to be learned, but what we must assume is that the reader has at minimum a good understanding of the following and all of the background that each would require to understand:

'''Matrices'''
*Basic Operations
*Inverse
*Determinant
*Eigenvalues &amp; Eigenvectors

'''Taylor Series'''
*Linearization

'''Ordinary Differential Equations'''
*Linear Equations
*Homogenous Solutions
*Particular Solutions

'''Newtonian Physics'''
*Basic Velocitory and Aceleratory Understanding
*Inertia &amp; Damping
*Hooke's Law

'''MATLAB'''

'''Microsoft Excel'''

'''Fluid Dynamics'''

'''Probability'''
*Distribution
*Density
*Basic Correlation

'''Electrical Engineering Basics'''
*Resistor/Capacitor Systems

Don't worry if you aren't entirely familiar with all of these; certainly some can be considered to follow after the study of Vibration or some may seem virtually unrelated. They have only been noted to suggest the best background possible for success in quickly and efficiently learning the material presented in this text.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Understanding the Node Graph==
With the Node Graph you can apply operations on images and create 3D effects. The node graph provides a visual structure to represent
*a relation's tree of entities in a 3D world,
*and a sequence of operations on images.


[[Image:NodeGraphTab.png|center|thumb|600px|Node graph tab]]

The node graph is represented by nodes connected to each other by lines referred to as edges. In this node-based workflow each node in the graph performs a specific function.

Node inputs are on the top of the node. Node outputs are on the bottom of the node. The output port of one node is attached to the input port of the next node down in the node graph.

Nodes inputs and outputs are color coded, green and red, representing the 2 types of ports. Edges can only be connected between ports of the same color (type).
As said before, the node graph can be used to structure a 3D world and perform operations on images. Nodes with green ports are image nodes, they apply image processing operations over the input image and return the processed image in their output port. The nodes with only red ports are called 3D nodes, they simply represent a structure of a 3D world. The [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Nodes Reference/ImagePlane node|ImagePlane node]] is the only node with ports of different colors, used to bring a image to the 3D space. Inputs and outputs can also have tool tips describing the data they provide.

[[Image:CameraBackgroundTab.png|right|thumb|Parameter window]]

As you create a node graph you need to edit nodes parameters and visualize the output of different nodes. Parameter windows allow you to edit node's parameters while using the output window to inspect the different steps of the node graph. To bring up the parameters window just click over a node, selecting it. A parameters window pops up showing the node's parameters if no parameters window is open already. By default only one parameters window is opened and everytime a node is selected the node's parameters will be show in the opened parameters window.

The output window as a similar behaviour as the parameters window. To show the output window use the node's button located the right side of the node. Not all nodes have a output button, and different nodes might have different buttons. Clicking this button opens a output window in the same way a parameters window pops up.

To have more than one parameters window or output window see ...

Using the parameters window to modify one node parameter while visualising the result at a different node is one of the great advantages of using a node graph.

===Applying operations on images===
Image nodes are a subset of the Mewa Film nodes and understanding a node graph of image nodes is different to understanding a node graph of 3D nodes. Image nodes have green ports, they receive images as inputs and output an image.

The node graph of image nodes provides a top down &quot;schematic&quot; view of operations aplied over images. With an image ([[Mewa Film User's Guide/Nodes Reference/Footage node|footage node]]) as the top most node, image processing operations represented by nodes, are connected to the footage node. Image data is passed top-down, from one node to the next node connected to it. Thus, the image is modified by each node which output the processed image at it;s output. This structure of nodes ilustrates the operations and the order of operations applied to images (footage node).

Image processing nodes have a button on the right side, with a icon symbolizing a stack of images, see the figure on the right.

[[Image:NodeStackButton.png|right|thumb|Button]]

This button shows the output image of the node, this is very usefull to inspect the different stages of image processing operations over footage through the node graph.

The advantage of using a node graph is it makes possible to edit the parameters of any node while visualizing the output of any node simultaneously.

[[Image:ImageOperationsWithNodeGraph.png|center|thumb|600px|Working with images in the node graph]]

The size of the output image is the same size as the input image. If a image node has more than one input, the size of the input more to the left is the one which sets the size of the output.

===Creating a 3D effect===
With 3D nodes you can create 3D effects and animations by manipulating objects in a 3D space. 3D nodes have red ports and can represent any element in the 3D space. A translation to a 3D object, a camera, a image plane, a light, or a 3D model. 3D nodes can represent 3D objects and transformations applied inside the 3D space. A 3D object can be something as simple as a cube, sphere, or cone, or as complex as a character. Although some basic geometric objects are included with Mewa Film, most geometry is imported from a 3D application. A model is another way to refer to a geometric object.

When building a 3D world with the node graph you can imagine an empty 3D space where you start adding 3D objects represented by nodes. Then you add nodes to position and rotate your 3D objects.

Use [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Nodes Reference/Translate node|translate nodes]] and [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Nodes Reference/Rotate node|rotate nodes]] to animate the position and orientation of 3D objects, which can be connected to the camera node. A [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Nodes Reference/Camera node|Camera node]] only shows the 3D objects connected to it. You create a scene hierarchy by connecting nodes. This hierarchy describes the relationship between objects where a parent object is connected to a child object. Transformations that you apply to the parent object are applied to its child object.

The camera node is the starting point to create any 3D effect, it has a button, with an eye icon, that opens a output window showing the scene.

==Navigating the Node Graph==

===Pan===
The mouse middle button to pans the node graph view.

===Zoom===
Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

==Editing a Node Graph==
===Creating Nodes===
We start creating a node graph by adding nodes to the node graph window. To add nodes use the [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Main_window#Nodes_toolbar|nodes tool bar]], a menu appears listing the names of the available tools, just click the tool you wish to use and the corresponding node will be added to the Node graph.

Footage nodes are added to the node graph in a different way. See [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Nodes Reference/Footage node#Add footage to the node graph|Add footage to the node graph]] to know more.

===Moving Nodes===
To move a node, select the node and drag it within the Node Graph window.

Selecting a node will also pop the [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Using_the_Node_Graph#Parameters_window|parameters window]] of the node.

===Selecting nodes===
Nodes can be selected by mouse clicking, shift-clicking, or rubberbanding. Selected nodes are indicated by a blue stroke around the outside of the Node body. Items can be deselected by clicking on empty space in the node graph window.

[[Image:NodeGraph-RubberBand.png|right|thumb|Rubber band selection]]

To select nodes and edges with rubber band click with mouse left button on a empty space on the node graph window and drag the mouse to create the rubber band rectangle. When releasing, all items interecepted by the rubberband rectangle become selected.

The all node graph can be selected using keyboard shortcut ''Ctrl-A''.

===Connecting Nodes===
Edges are the visual representation of a connection between nodes. To connect two nodes, with the left mouse button, click and drag from one node port releasing over another node port.

Note that only connections between ports of the same color are allowed, and also only connections between inputs and outputs are allowed.

Ports provide information whether a connection is allowed or not. A port become highlighted if it can be dragged to create a connection and if it can connect to the dragging edge. If a connection is not allowed, the destination port does not get highlighted.

===Disconnecting nodes===
One way to disconnect two nodes is deleting the edge connecting the two nodes and delete it. An edge is selected using the ''rubber band selection'', see how to use the rubber band in [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Using_the_Node_Graph#Selecting_nodes|selecting nodes]]. After selecting the edges, the edges become blue. Then just press ''delete'' key to delete it.

==Parameters window==

[[Image:CameraBackgroundTab.png|right|thumb|Parameters window]]

A movie, or animation, is a sequence of still images, called frames, that played in quick succession are perceived as continuous motion. An animation is created by changing the value of a parameter over time. A parameter can be anything from the position, rotation, scaling, or transparency of an object, to the gamma, gain, or offset in a colour correction. Basically, any node parameter can be animated.

Nodes parameters are shown in parameter windows when a node is selected. In this window you can modify all available parameters from a node.

It's possible to have more than one parameter window open ... all parameter windows have at the top ...

===Using expressions in parameters===
All parameters have a input box, where a value can be inserted directly. But not only values can be inserted, the input box also accepts expressions. e.g. insert the following expression ''3*2''. 

The [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Scripting#Script Editor|script editor]] can be used to check an expression. See [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Scripting#Using the command line|Using the command line]] to read more.

===Controlling a parameter with a curve===
To create animations we use the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Animating parameters with Curve Editor|curve editor]]. A curve is attached to a parameter in the same way as a expression, this is important because it makes possible to access information in any node and use it in a different node, in other words, use the same curve on as much parameters as we wish.

The curve editor button has 2 clickable areas, a area with an icon and a second area with a down arrow. The drop down at the right, if clicked, shows a list of the available curves. Selecting one of the listed curves will associate the parameter with the choosen curve. The input text box will then show ''curvename.value(time)''.

Instead of using the curve editor button you can write ''curvename.value(time)'' directly in the input text box. Note that the text becomes blue, mining that a curve was found and succefully attached.

===Notes tab===
All nodes have a notes tab where any text can be inserted.

==Output window==
The output window is used in the node graph to display the output at a specific node. It can display the view of a camera node or show the output image of a image processing node.

You can change any node parameters while watching the result at the output window. This ability to choose the node to be displayed in the Output window from the node being edited in the Parameters window is central to working with Mewa Film node graph.

The window title gives information about the shown output.

Output windows are mostly used with the node graph, but output windows can also be used in montage to preview images at full resolution, see how to [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Editing with Montage#View a frame at full resolution|view a frame at full resolution]].

===Output window of image processing nodes===
Below is output window showing the output of a image processing node.

[[Image:OutputWindow.png|center|thumb|250px|Output of a image node]]

At the top left corner we have four check boxes named ''R'', ''G'', ''B'' and ''A'' reespectively. These check boxes, checked by default, represent image's RGBA channels. By modifying the state of these check boxes the user can isolate the channels, e.g the user wishes to view only the green channel, so will keep the green channel (check box named ''G'') checked, and uncheck the ''R'', ''B'' and ''A'' check boxes.

Followed by the channel check boxes we have the ''Fit'' button. When pressing the ''Fit'' button the shown image will be scaled and centered to fit the all image inside the output window.

===Output window of 3D nodes===
Node button is located on the right hand side of the node (see pic). Not all nodes provide a button, these button open a output window if none is already open.

The buttons symbol is described below ...

[[Image:NodeEyeButton.png|center|thumb|Button]]

When a node button is toggled a output window pop if none is open already, a the corresponding data is shown.

[[Image:CameraOutputWindow.png|center|thumb|Output of a 3D node]]

===Render===
Exporting the output is done on the output window. In the output window click [[Image:RenderButton.png]] to show the render dialog.

[[Image:RenderDialog.png|center|thumb|380px|Render dialog]]

==Multiple Parameter/Output windows==
You can create as many parameter windows as you need and up to 3 output windows. Each output window can be set to independently display any image channel from any node in the current node tree.

&lt;!-- Each output window has its own view shelf with its own controls --&gt;

The pin button is located in the top righ of the output window and is used to manage multiple output windows. Both parameter windows and Output windows have this pin button. Once one output window is open, by default the opened window will be used to display any node output.

To create additional Parameter/Output windows toggle the pin button, this holds the output to the node. When a Parameter/Output window is requested a new window will be created above the main window.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is the Curve Editor==
The curve editor is the heart of any animation, its a very intuitive graphical tool where you can model the behaviour of one or more parameters over time as a curve, e.g. to animate an 3D object we change the position and orientation of the object on successive frames to create the illusion of movement.

In the [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Using_the_Node_Graph|node graph]] each node has its own parameters shown at [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Using_the_Node_Graph#Parameters_window|parameters window]] where they can be modified. To see the node's parameters just click the node to make parameters window pop up.

Every parameter have a input text box where a value or expression can be inserted.

[[Image:SliderControl.png|right|thumb|Node parameter]]

If a expression is inserted in the text box, every time the [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Main_window#Player_toolbar|current frame number]] changes the result of the expression inside the parameter text box is calculated, that's why if the parameter input box contains a number the parameter will have a constant behaviour through time.

To have different value for every frame than you add an expression, e.g. ''2*time'', where ''time'' represents the current frame number. To know more about expressions see the [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Scripting|scripting]] chapter. 

Well, it's also possible to create a custom function using a curve, and model the curve point by point. That's why the curve editor is so good, you dont need to understand maths or programming, with the curve editor you can create your own curve, and use it in any parameter in the same way an expression is used.

[[Image:NodegraphParameterAssociatedCurve.png|center|thumb|500px|Associating a curve to a node's parameter]]

All parameters have a button [[Image:CurveButton.png]] with a down arrow next to it. You can associate an existing curve by clicking the down arrow, to show the menu with a list of available curves, and from the curve list click the curve you want to associate. If you want to create a new curve click the button [[Image:CurveButton.png]]. The name of the created curve contains the node name followed by the parameter name. To change the curve's name see [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Animating_parameters_with_Curve_Editor#Renaming_a_curve|renaming a curve]].

==The Curve Editor window==
To open the curve editor choose ''Curve Editor'' in the ''View'' menu.

[[Image:CurveEditorWindow.png|center|thumb|500px|Curve Editor window]]

Curve Editor window is divided in 2 panes, at the left pane we have the curve list, listing all the available curves. At right pane we have the area where the curve is edited.

A curve can have as many points as you need and each point has an interpolation method that can choosen. Every curve has 2 extrapolations.

===Fit in view===
The ''Fit in view'' button zooms the view to fit the selected points on the current view. If there are no points selected the ''Fit in view'' button will fit all points of the current selected curves.

===Frame and value input boxes===
Frame and value input boxes are enabled only when 1 point of a curve is selected.

You may move curve points manually by dragging them with the mouse, or you may type the exact yy value at the ''value'' input box. The xx value of a point is called frame. By entering a value at the frame input box will move the selected point to the entered frame number.

===Curve List===
The curve list shows all the existing curves. When a curve is create, is added to this list.

To delete a curve(s) select one or more curves and click [[Image:DeleteButton.png]]. Parameters using the deleted curve will replace their fiels with current value.

===Zoom and Pan===
You may navigate the Curve Editor space by using the Middle Mouse button to pan and the mouse wheel to zoom.

===Choose the curves to show===
When we have many curves we may want to choose the ones we want to see and edit, for that reason only the selected curves from the ''curve list'' are shown. To select one curve just click the curve to show in the ''curve list''. To select more than one curve, and consequently show more than one curve, hold Ctrl key while clicking on the desired curves.

===Change curve color===
The curve list shows all curves listed by name and respective color. If the rectangle containing the curve color is clicke a color dialog pops up allowing you to choose a different color for the curve.

===Renaming a curve===
*In the ''curve list'' double click on the curve to rename
*Type the curve new name followed by '''enter''' key.

All the parameters referencing the renamed curve will be updated with the new name.

==Editing curves==

Extrapolation lines are drawn as dash lines. 
There are 2 extrapolation regions, ''before curve'' extrapolation and ''after curve'' extrapolation.

===Working with curve points===
Manipulating the curve to obtain the desired curve is easilly achieved by moving and creating new points. To move a point mouse left-click over a point and drag to the new point position.

It's also possible to move a selection of points, selecting the points followed by a drag of one of the selected points.

There are several ways to select points in a cure, the most usual way is by is clicking on the point you wish to select. To select multiple points you can
*use the rubber band or
*hold shift key while clicking on the points to select.

Left mouse clicking in a empty area clears any selection of points.

To add points,
*click over a curve line, both curve line or extrapolation line. Note that the mouse cursor changes it's icon to a point finger icon to indicate that the mouse is over a line and if you click a point will be created.
*or use the context menu, right-mouse click and choose ''New Point''.

===Deleting points===
*Select the points to delete and press ''delete'' key,
*or, right-click over one of the selected points to open the context menu and choose ''delete''.

===Curve Interpolation===
Interpolation defines the shape of a curve between points. The interpolation mode is mostly used to choose the smoothness of the transitions of a curve between points, the smoother the transition between each point the less jitter you have in the respective animated parameter.

There are 2 interpolation methods available,
*Linear interpolation
*Cubic interpolation

The interpolation is set by point, this means 1 point can have linear interpolation and the next point can have cubic interpolation. The default is linear interpolation, which consists on a straight line between points.

To change the interpolation mode between points,
#right click on a point to open the context menu
#and from the context menu select an interpolation mode.

[[Image:PointContextMenu.png|center|thumb|Point context menu]]

Cubic interpolation is more sophisticated than linear interpolation, it creates a bezier curve between 2 points.
When cubic interpolation is chosen 2 tangent controls appear, also called handlers. Use these handlers to adjust the cubic interpolation to a desired form.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| [[Image:CurveEditor-LinearInterpolation.png|center|thumb|Linear interpolation]] || [[Image:CurveEditor-CubicInterpolation.png|center|thumb|Cubic interpolation]]
|}

Note that the left handler has a different color from the right hand side handler, this is to make it more easy to identify a handler when you have many handlers near to each other.

The interpolation between the selected point and the next point is changed. For example, the following figure shows the results of changing a keyframe’s interpolation from Constant to Hermite in an animation curve that uses Constant interpolation. Obviously the last point of a curve does not have a interpolation because does not have a next point to it.

To change the interpolation mode for a group of points,
#Press CTRL and select the points for which you want to change the interpolation,
#right click on one of the selected points to open the context menu,
#and from the context menu, select an interpolation mode.

===Curve  Extrapolation===
Extrapolation is the region of the curve outide the movable points, represented as a dashed line with the same color as the curve.
Extrapolation defines the shape of an animation curve before the first point or after the last point. The default extrapolation method is ''Constant extrapolation'', which simply holds the value steady.

The extrapolation methods available are,
*Constant extrapolation
*Linear extrapolation

The constant extrapolation, as said before, holds the first or last point value steady. It looks as an horizontal line.

[[Image:ConstantExtrapolation.png|center|thumb|Constant extrapolation]]

Linear extrapolation continue the value on its current slope.

[[Image:LinearExtrapolation.png|center|350px|thumb|Linear extrapolation]]

The slope of the linear extrapolation is defined by the point behind the last (or first) point, or by the cubic interpolation handler as shown by right side extrapolation of the image above.

To choose a extrapolation you use the context menu. To choose the extrapolation ''before curve'' right-click over the first point of the curve. To choose the ''after curve'' extrapolation activate the context menu on the last point of the curve.

===Copy and paste points===
*Select the points to copy and press ''Ctrl+C'',
*move the play head to the frame which the copied points will be inserted,
*press Ctrl+V to paste.

Note that the curve's section after the play head is shifted to the right to give space for the new pasted points.

Mewa Film scripting offers the artist a huge creative freedom, not only by giving the ability to use a wide variety of expressions and script code directly within any parameter of the application but also by giving the ability to create scripts.

Scripts can be written for numerous purposes, one of the most common uses is the automation of a specific set of tasks.

==Concepts==

An expression is any non-numeric entry, such as a variable or a mathematical expression. Any parameter can use an expression. Some expressions, such as time, are extremely simple. When you type the expression variable ''time'' into a value field, Mewa Film returns the numeric value of the current playhead position. For example, if the playhead (current time in [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Main window#Player toolbar|player toolbar]]) is parked at frame 1, typing ''time'' into a value field returns a value of 1 in that field.

==Script Editor==
To open the script editor choose the menu ''View &gt;&gt; Script Editor''.

[[Image:ScriptEditorWindow.png|center|thumb|Script Editor window]]

The script editor window is divided in 2 areas, the top area is a text editor where you can edit your script and then press ''run'' to execute the script. The script output comes on the bottom pane. The bottom pane ... command line, you can type a command followed by ''Enter''.

===Using the command line===
To check an expression using the script editor, in the command line area, just type your expression ...

==Creating a script==
Mewa Script is based on the ECMAScript scripting language, as defined in standard ECMA-262, most known as Java Script.

===print() function===
the ''print'' function is very useful for simple debugging purposes as to give feedback during a script execution.

&lt;pre&gt;
a=4;
print(a);
&lt;/pre&gt;

will print the contents of ''a''.

&lt;pre&gt;
str=&quot;this is text&quot;;
print(str);
&lt;/pre&gt;

===The ''time'' variable===

&lt;pre&gt;
time=5
&lt;/pre&gt;

moves the play head to frame number 5.

= Najdorf Sicilian, English Attack =
'''Moves:1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.Be3 e5'''

In recent years, the most popular way for white to combat the Najdorf Variation at master level has been 6.Be3. This is called the English Attack, after successful use in the 1980s by English GMs such as Nunn, Short, and Miles. 

The idea is nothing new: it has been for over half a century the most popular plan of attack against the [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...c5/2. Nf3/2...d6/3. d4/3...cxd4/4. Nxd4/4...Nf6/5. Nc3/5...g6|Dragon Sicilian]]. It seems a bit like caveman chess: pawn storm with f2-f3, g2-g4, h2-h4 and crack open the kingside while castling long. Such crude play would seem to be easy to punish, but the statistics have given White no reason to stop playing the system: out of 7,000 master-level games dating from 1956 to 2008, White won 39% (2697 games) and drew 29% (2027 games). This should be good for White, who can expect to win only about 36% of the time and draw only 28% when entering the Najdorf Sicilian.

Black's 6...e5 is the most popular, and the most unbalancing, response to 6.Be3. The pawn thrust drives off the well-placed White knight on d4 to a more passive square. Two active proponents of this idea are World Champion Anand and world #1 Carlsen. Although there is a hole on d5, Black is saying, basically, that it is irrelevant to the play on the wings, while White is saying that Black will be lost if d5 is occupied.

Besides the normal, routine 7.Nb3, White also has the less popular 7.Nf3 and the passive 7.Nde2, which gives Black a good game.

==Directions==
With your {{{name|}}} seeds and all of your tools ready, it is time to plant and grow some {{{name|}}}!

{{ #if: {{{seed image|}}}|[[File:{{{seed image}}}|thumb|right|A {{{name|}}} seed.]]|}}
===Step 1===
First, you have to separate and count the seeds that you want to plant.

{{-}}
[[File:Wikibooks planting-soil in pot.jpg|thumb|right|Leave a little space from the top of the pot!]]
===Step 2===
Then, either use your hands or a small cup to put your soil into the pot. Fill the pot with soil until it is close to the top. Gently push on the soil so it is a little firm, but not too much.


{{-}}
[[File:Wikibooks planting-hole.JPG|thumb|right|The hole should be {{{depth|}}} deep.]]
===Step 3===
Dig a small hole, either with your finger or with one of your tools. Measure the hole so that it is {{{depth|}}} from the top of the soil.

{{-}}
[[File:Wikibooks planting-cover.JPG|thumb|right|Cover the seed with soil.]]
===Step 4===
Pick up your seed drop it in the hole! Then, take a pinch of soil and fill the hole. Again, gently press down on the soil.
 
{{-}}
[[File:Wikibooks planting-watering.JPG|thumb|right|The seed is thirsty, so give it some water!]]
===Step 5===
Pour a litle water into your pot.

== Image Problem ==
Hi. I saw you uploaded a few images, but there is a problem with a couple of them. They are missing a license. If one is not applied by July 15th, they will be deleted. If you made the images yourself, I would suggest adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PD-Self}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the page. If you did not make the yourself, look at [[Wikibooks:Media]] and see what license best applies. Here are the images that do not have a license.&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:PerpendicularBisectorJPEG.jpg|50px]]&lt;br&gt;

Looking at all four of them, they all appear to be the same image. Would you like the other three to be deleted? [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 15:01, 10 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

Some of the theories and mathematical structures you will be learning shortly are entirely classical; in fact, the root of vibrational study is a derivation of [[Wikipedia:Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws of motion]]. During approximately the last four hundred years there has been an increased interest in this subject as engineers have been reevaluating earlier simpler formulation and design in an effort to maximize stability within their particular creation or area of focus. It is typically the vibration of all parts in a machine that can lead to its eventual failure and we are concerned with gaining the ability to shrink vibrational freedom. There are many applications where vibrations are permitted or even encouraged regarding the system; our efforts are typically reduction, though. The history of the evolution of vibrational study was modernized by the work of Lord Rayleigh in his book ''The Theory of Sound''; a reminder that in essence both vibration and acoustics are intrinsically identical.

We can begin by firstly separating some key terms in order to clarify before there is much room to get lost. The following terms will be used often:


[[Image:Beam mode 2.gif|right|thumb|250px|One of the possible modes of '''vibration''' of a cantilevered |I-beam.]]'''Vibration''' is a reciprocating motion of an elastic body or virtually any medium forced from a state of equilibrium. A classic example is a bell that has been struck with a hammer. It will periodically change its shape between two extremes. This can be heard as a sound and felt on the surface.&lt;/br&gt;Another example is given in the animation.

'''Oscillation''' is a reciprocating movement of a complete structure. An example could be the pad of an orbital sander which swings back and forth without actually changing its shape. 

 ''A vibrating structure undergoes deformation, while an oscillating structure does not.''

'''Structures''' range from simple objects like beams or rods to more complex things like rotor blades or the fuselage of an aircraft. Structures may be composed from several parts, but they can be considered one part in their analysis.

'''Systems''' are more general and abstract. They can loosely be defined as a grouping of parts, such as an assembly with different, distinguishable parts that do however interact closely with each other.

 ''All structures are systems, not vice-versa.''

[[Image:Damped spring.gif|right|frame|A '''damped''' spring-mass system.]]
'''Environments''' are external to the system but have the ability to interact with them and influence the system's behavior.

'''Modeling''' is the act of representing certain properties of physical structures or systems by means of mathematical formulation, simulation or the like. 

'''Inertia''' is the property of a mass which makes it resist any change in motion.

'''Stiffness''' is the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an applied force. The stiffer a structure the more resistant it is to deformation. 

'''Damping''' is the effect that reduces the amplitude of oscillations or vibrations over time by dissipating the kinetic energy that caused the movement into heat (see animation).

Do we need this section? What is the audience for this book? Wouldn't anyone seeking to learn about persistence in Java already know what Java is? [[User:Pengo|Pengo]] ([[User talk:Pengo|talk]]) 01:41, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

:It is a pretty brief section, but I think worthwhile having.  If nothing else it can help clarify what this book is about for people looking for a book on coffee.

:&quot;Do we need this section? What is the audience for this book? Wouldn't anyone seeking to learn about persistence in Java already know what Java is?&quot; Yes. Java developers. I assume they would.

== Missing ==

A scan of the contents suggests there's no discussion of the addition of unique constraints other than the primary key to tables.  Is this correct?  If so, shouldn't such a discussion be added somewhere? [[Special:Contributions/212.159.69.4|212.159.69.4]] ([[User talk:212.159.69.4|discuss]]) 08:13, 27 August 2011 (UTC)

:Yes, it would be good to have a section on DDL generation and constraints.  Feel free to add one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Units ==

Before you begin the second chapter of this book be sure to refamiliarize yourself with the following physical measurements. In the typical fashion of working almost exclusively in SI units as part of an effort to remove the engineering profession from outdated unitary systems, this text will present all problems in SI. You should be familiar with their English equivalents; afterall, if you plan on working in the United States you will be using English Units. The table below should cover all the units we will use throughout the text.

'''Daifukumochi (大福餅)''', or '''Daifuku (大福)''' (literally &quot;great luck&quot;), is a Japanese confection consisting of a small round ''mochi'' (glutinous rice cake) stuffed with sweet filling, most commonly ''[[Cookbook:Red Bean Paste|anko]]'', sweetened red bean paste made from azuki beans.  

Daifuku comes in many varieties. The most common is white, pale green or pale pink colored mochi filled with anko. These come in two sizes, one approximately the diameter of a half-dollar coin, the other palm-sized. Some versions contain whole pieces of fruit, mixtures of fruit and anko or crushed melon paste. Nearly all daifuku are covered in a fine layer of potato or taro starch to keep them from sticking to each other, or to the fingers.  Some are covered with confectioner's sugar or cocoa.

==Ingredients==

*1 c. sweet or glutinous rice flour/mochiko (available from Asian markets)
*2/3 c. water
*1/4 c. sugar
*potato starch/katakuriko (approx. 1/2 c.)
*[[Cookbook:Red Bean Paste|anko filling]]

==Procedure==

Prepare [[Cookbook:Red Bean Paste|anko filling]], form 12 small balls (marble sized) and set aside.

Prepare a smooth surface, such as a cutting board, by coating with potato starch; be generous, as the dough that will be spread out will be very sticky.

In a microwave bowl or measuring cup, heat water and sugar together in a microwave until sugar is dissolved.  Add rice flour and stir completely.  Microwave for 2 minutes, remove and stir.  Microwave for 2 more minutes or until dough begins to expand.  Remove from microwave, stir again, and remove the dough to the potato starch coated surface.  The dough, called ''[[Cookbook:Mochi|mochi]]'', will be '''very hot!'''

Spread mochi out until thin.  Using a knife, cut into 12 even sized pieces.  Coat the palms and fingers of your hands in potato starch.  Spread each piece out as thin as possible, keeping in mind the mochi is '''hot'''.  Place an anko ball in the middle, then wrap the mochi around the ball, forming a bigger ball.    Roll in potato starch and set on a plate coated with potato starch or a piece of wax paper.  

Serve warm or cool.  Store in an airtight container.  Very perishable.

==Variations==

*Chocolate chips may be substituted for anko.
*Food coloring may be added to the water before the rice flour is mixed in.
*Cocoa powder may be used instead of potato starch in the final step.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Perl 5.10 ==

Perl 5.10 was a release version of the perl programming language that included a few new special features. Around the same time that Perl 5.10 was being prepared, design was moving forward rapidly in the design of the new Perl 6 language. Perl 6 was going to be very different from Perl 5, but in some ways still very much the same.

Because the two versions were being designed simultaneously, and because some of the same people were involved in both design processes, the two share a few features. From the exchange, Perl 5.10 got the '''smart-match operator''', a switch-style '''given-when''' control structure, a '''defined-or''' operator and '''state variables''', plus a number of internal performance enhancements.

== Smart Match Operator ==

The '''smart match''' operator is like &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;eq&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;=~&lt;/code&gt; all crammed together, with a few extra features added as well. Smart match determines whether two objects match, regardless of what type of objects you throw at it.

== Given - When ==

Perl finally has a '''switch'''-like statement built into the language. Instead of using the popular '''switch''' and '''case''' keywords found in C, Perl 5.10 uses '''given''' and '''when'''.

For instance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $option = 3;

given ($option) {
    when (0) { say 'Option 0 is chosen!'; }
    when (1) { say 'We have an option 1 here'; }
    when (2) { say 'Option is 2'; }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Perl's '''given'''/'''when''' construct is much more powerful than C's '''switch'''/'''case''' construct, however. Rather than just allowing integers as the match criteria for each '''when''' clause, strings, regular expressions, and even arrays are allowed. For instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $name = 'Superman';

given ($name) {
    when ('Batman') { say 'Da na na na na na na na ... BATMAN!'; }
    when ('Superman') { say &quot;It's a bird, it's a plane...&quot;; }
    when (/woman/) { say 'Good day miss'; }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Defined-Or ==

Consider the oft-used code fragment:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if(!defined($thing)) {
   $thing = $new_thing;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

or, the more idiomatically-perl version:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$thing = $new_thing unless(defined($thing));
&lt;/source&gt;

Since this is so common, it was determined to make it into it's own operator: the '''defined-or''' operator:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
  $thing //= $new_thing;
&lt;/source&gt;

== State Variables ==

Perl 5.10 introduced the '''state''' keyword to declare persistent variables that retain their values between calls to a subroutine. State variables serve much the same purpose as static variables in C.

With previous versions of Perl, to declare a persistent variable, we had to declare it outside the subroutine:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
{
    my $count = 0;
    sub incrementCount {
        return $count ++;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This construct is rather ugly, because the subroutine must be placed within a block itself. Using the new '''state''' keyword, we can rewrite the code above as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub incrementCount {
    state $count = 0;
    return $count ++;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This book is still in an early stage of development. Many topics do not yet have pages, many pages consist of text dumped from our teaching resources, and many of the current pages are stubs. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

This book provides an introduction to Software Engineering from a perspective of an integration of agile perspectives and structured methodologies. Every section will have a case study.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motivation ==

This Wikibook contains links to code samples executed on a University server.  We need to keep track of all the links so that we can ensure that they remain live, so that all links can be executed by a test bed and to support changes to the directory structure or filenames.

== Approach ==

The script is similar to the index script at the beginning, to get the list of pages in the book. Then it fetches each page and extracts the anchor tags whose href links to the UWE eXist site. The WikiBook page is linked from the page title and the actual URL is listed.


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace h =&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;

let $book:= request:get-parameter(&quot;book&quot;,&quot;XQuery&quot;)
let $base := &quot;http://en.wikibooks.org&quot;
let $indexPage :=doc(concat($base,&quot;/wiki/Category:&quot;,$book,&quot;?x&quot;))
let $pages := $indexPage//h:div[@id=&quot;mw-pages&quot;]//h:li

    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Index of {$book} code samples&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
{
for $letter in distinct-values($pages/upper-case(substring(substring-after(.,'/'),1,1)))[string-length(.) = 1]
for $page in $pages[starts-with(upper-case(substring-after(.,'/')),$letter)]
let $title := string($page)
let $url := concat($base,$page/h:a/@href)
let $refs := doc($url)//h:a[starts-with(@href,&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki&quot;)]
order by $title
return
   if (exists($refs))
   then 
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{$url}&quot;&gt;{$title}&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;ul&gt;
            {for $ref in  $refs
              return 
                 &lt;li&gt; {string( $ref /@href)} &lt;/li&gt;
            }

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Idealization &amp; Formulation ==


In accord with how most engineers approach a problem, when we start studying systems we begin by taking a realistic problem and turning it into a specific mathematical formulation which will utilize known or currently developing techniques. It is standard to begin by taking a relatively complex and seemingly disordered system and creating a model which is simple, but also behaviorally correct. These simpler systems are called ''idealized systems'' and they are created by firstly having a deeply sophisticated understanding of the actual system and is derived from the actual system. When working in the derived idealized system, insight into the limitations of the actual system are developmentally realized; it is with this in mind that we always work from the ground up in all engineering and physical applications.
In the same way that in a first semester physics class you were trained to use a point-mass model when solving for a typical pulley/weight/etc. system and then move forward into more point-masses and eventually (as in a statics class) a distributed mass, we will move in the exact same ordering. Below you will see a few examples of increasingly complex idealistic modular representations:


[[Image:Structureandideal.jpg]]


Those are the classic steps towards approximating systems as done in a physics class. Next we will look at a schematic of a car and the models we will use throughout this text. These models are based off of the tire-suspension systems as well as the wheels and the body of the car. Below are the increasingly complex idealistic representations:


[[Image:Structureandideal2.jpg]]


This text will nearly follow the above flow of modeling.  There are also other vibration freedoms we will study; namely axial and torsional, and towards the very end nonlinear models.

&lt;big&gt;'''Randomized Trials of Radiation Therapy Technology'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Radiation Therapy Machines==
*'''Hopital Timone, Marseille''' (2006) -- Gamma Knife 4C vs PerfeXion
**Randomized. 200 patients. Arm 1) GammaKnife 4C vs Arm 2) GammaKnife PerfeXion
**'''2009''' PMID 19190462 -- &quot;Radiosurgery with the world's first fully robotized Leksell Gamma Knife PerfeXion in clinical use: a 200-patient prospective, randomized, controlled comparison with the Gamma Knife 4C.&quot; (Regis J, Neurosurgery. 2009 Feb;64(2):346-55; discussion 355-6.)
***Outcome: No technical failures. Median # of collimator sizes 4C 1 vs PerfeXion 2. Median treatment time 60 min vs 40 min (SS), but median beam-on time 33.4 vs 34.0 minutes (NS). Single run 42% vs. 99%. Collision risk requiring gamma angle 24% vs 0%.
***Toxicity: Less dose with PerfeXion to vertex (8x), thyroid (10x), sternum (13x), and gonads (15X)
***Conclusion: Technological advances with PerfeXion

==Immobilization==
===Head &amp; Neck===
*'''Princess Margaret''' (2006-2008) -- standard immobilization mask vs skin-sparing immobilization mask
**Randomized. 762 CBCT scans in 20 patients. Arm 1) standard mask (SM) vs Arm 2) skin-sparing mask (SSM) modified with low neck cutouts
**'''2010''' PMID 20056344 -- &quot;Cone-beam CT assessment of interfraction and intrafraction setup error of two head-and-neck cancer thermoplastic masks.&quot; (Velec M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Mar 1;76(3):949-55. Epub 2010 Jan 7.)
***Outcome:  Initial interfraction sigma SM 1.6 mm or 1.1 degrees vs SSM 2.0 mm and 0.8 degrees. No difference after CBCT correction. Initial intrafraction sigma &lt;1 mm and &lt;1 degree for both masks.
***Conclusion: Interfraction and intrafraction setup error not significantly different between masks. Mask cutouts should be considered to reduce skin toxicity

*'''Karolinska Hospital''' (Sweden)(1998-2001) -- head mask vs head-and-neck mask setup
**Randomized. 241/260 patients. H&amp;N cancers excluding NPC. Arm 1) Head mask vs. Arm 2) Head-and-shoulder mask. Both Posicast thermoplastic masks. Assessed reproducibility (port films and table positions), patient tolerability (fit, pain, movement within, claustrophobia), and skin damage
**'''2005''' PMID 15629618 -- &quot;Randomized trial on two types of thermoplastic masks for patient immobilization during radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer.&quot; (Sharp L, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Jan 1;61(1):250-6.)
***Outcome: No difference in reproducibility of setup
***Toxicity: Claustrophobia head mask 45% vs. head-and-shoulder maks 58% (SS), otherwise no difference in tolerability. Skin toxicity Grade 3 head mask 21% vs. head-and-shoulder mask 39% (SS)
***Conclusion: Smaller head makes reduced claustrophobial and skin reactions, without compromising reproducibility of the setup

===Prostate===
*'''Princess Margaret''' -- VacLok vs BodyFix
**Randomized. 32 patients. Arm 1) VacLok immobilization vs. Arm 2) BodyFix adbominal compression. Interfraction motion &gt;3 mm corrected pre-treatment
**'''2008''' PMID 18279985 -- &quot;A randomized comparison of interfraction and intrafraction prostate motion with and without abdominal compression.&quot; (Rosewall T, Radiother Oncol. 2008 Feb 13 [Epub ahead of print])
***Outcome: No difference in interfraction or intrafraction motion with or without adominal compression
***Conclusion: Addition of abdominal compression didn't influence interfraction or intrafraction prostate motion

*'''Nijmegen, The Netherlands''' -- 3D-CRT +/- endorectal balloon
**Randomized. 48 patients, treated with 3D-CRT to 67.5 Gy. Arm 1) No endorectal balloon (ERB-) vs. Arm 2) with endorectal balloon (ERB+). Rectosigmoidoscopy at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years. 146 endoscopies and 2,336 mucosal areas analyzed
**'''2007''' PMID 17161552 -- &quot;Reduced late rectal mucosal changes after prostate three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy with endorectal balloon as observed in repeated endoscopy.&quot; (van Lin EN, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Mar 1;67(3):799-811. Epub 2006 Dec 8.) Median F/U 2.5 years
***Outcome: ERB group significantly lower rectal wall volume exposed to high doses. Late rectal toxicity G1: ERB- 58% vs. ERB+ 21%; G2 4% vs. 0%; G3 4% vs. 0%. Overall G1+ rectal toxicity 67% vs. 21% (SS)
***Endoscopy: Telangiectasia ERB- vs ERB+ @ 6 months 16% vs. 24%; 1 year 45% vs. 28%; 2 years 39% vs. 24% (SS). High grade telangiectasia @ 1 years 20% vs. 10%; 2 years 19% vs. 9% (SS). Significantly less high grade telangiectasia at lateral and posterior part of Rwall
***Conclusion: ERB reduced rectal wall volume exposed to &gt;40 Gy, resulting in reduction of late mucosal changes and reduced late rectal toxicity

==Radiation Delivery: 3D Conformal RT==
===Prostate===
*'''Rotterdam, Netherlands''' (1994-1996) -- conformal RT vs conventional RT
**Randomized. 266 patients, prostate cancer Stage T1-4N0. RT 66/33. PTV expansion 15 mm. Arm 1) conventional RT (rectangular, open fields) vs. Arm 2) conformal RT (conformally shaped fields with MLC). PTV = GTV + 1.5 cm
**'''1999''' PMID 10098427 -- &quot;Acute morbidity reduction using 3DCRT for prostate carcinoma: a randomized study.&quot; (Koper PC, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999 Mar 1;43(4):727-34.)
***Outcome: Acute GI Grade 2 conventional 32% vs. conformal 19% (SS); Acute GU Grade 2 in 17% vs. 18% (NS). Further GI analysis: rectal symptoms 18% vs. 14% (NS) but anal symptoms 16% vs. 8% (SS)
***Conclusion: Significant reduction in GI toxicity, driven by anal symptoms. No difference between rectum/sigmoid and bladder toxicity

***Toxicity: Grade 2 conventional 10% vs 3D-CRT 7% (NS), Grade 1 47% vs. 40% (NS). Most bothersome symptoms: urgency, soiling, and fecal loss
***Predictors: Anal/rectal V90% for rectal toxicity. Acute anal/rectal toxicity for late rectal toxicity. Pretreatment urgency for later bladder toxicity
***Conclusion: Conformal RT at 66 Gy doesn't significantly decrease incidence of rectal, anal, and bladder toxicity compared with conventional RT

*'''Royal Marsden''' (1988-1995) -- conformal RT vs conventional RT
**Randomized. 225 men with prostate CA, T1-T4N0. NACHT in 68%. RT 64/31. Arm 1) conformal RT vs. Arm 2) conventional RT
**'''1999''' PMID 9929018 -- &quot;Comparison of radiation side-effects of conformal and conventional radiotherapy in prostate cancer: a randomised trial.&quot; (Dearnaley DP, Lancet. 1999 Jan 23;353(9149):267-72.) Median F/U 3.6 years
***Outcome: Radiation-induced proctitis G1+ conformal RT 37% vs. conventional RT 56% (SS), G2+ 5% vs. 15% (SS). No difference in bladder toxicity. No difference in bPFS (78% vs 83%, NS) 
***Conclusion: Conformal RT significantly reduced risk of late proctitis

==Radiation Delivery: IMRT==
===Head &amp; Neck===
*'''Prince of Wales Hospital; 2007''' (Hong Kong)(2001-2003) PMID 17971582 -- &quot;Prospective randomized study of intensity-modulated radiotherapy on salivary gland function in early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.&quot; (Kam MK, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Nov 1;25(31):4873-9.)
**Randomized. 60 patients with T1-2bN0-1 nasopharynx. Arm 1) IMRT 66 Gy (CTV=GTV + 1cm; at-risk anatomic sites; LN Levels IB-II, LN upper Level V, LN retropharyngeal; PTV=CTV+3mm), lower neck LN+ 66 Gy anterior field, LN- 54-60 Gy + intracavitary BT boostvs. Arm 2) 66 Gy 2D + intracavitary BT boost
**Outcome: observer-rated severe xerostomia IMRT 39% vs. 2D-RT 82% (SS), stimulated parotid flow (SS), unstimulated parotid flow (SS), but no difference in patient-reported feeling of xerostomia
**Conclusion: IMRT superior in preserving objective parotid function, but no difference in patient-reported benefit
**Editorial (PMID 17971579): Observer-rated scoring underestimates patient reports and has low agreement among various observers. Suspect sparing of parotid alone not sufficient. Parotid gland produces saliva without mucins (lubricants, bind water, and provide selective permeability barrier). Mucin-secreting glands (e.g. minor salivary glands, submandibular glands) produce &lt;10% saliva but &gt;50% mucins. May need to spare these glands as well for subjective feeling of benefit

**Randomized. 51 patients, Stage II (T2N0-1, AJCC 1997). Arm 1) conventional RT 68 Gy, neck 66 Gy vs. Arm 2) IMRT, GTV dose 68-72 Gy, PTV 66-68 Gy. Stimulated whole (SWS) and parotid (SPS) saliva flow evaluated, QoL SF-36, EORTC Core, EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 questionnaires. Minimum F/U 1 years
**1-year outcome: 25% whole flow (SWS) IMRT 50% vs. 2D 5% (SS), 25% parotid flow (SPS) 83% vs. 9% (SS). At 2 months, both group had xerostomia, but IMRT group improved significantly better over time. Also improvements in QoL
**Conclusion: IMRT significantly better than conventional RT for salivary function and QoL

===Breast===
*'''Canada''' (2003-2005) -- 2D vs. IMRT
**Randomized. 331 patients, early-stage BCA (no &gt;=4 LN+) treated with breast-only RT. Arm 1) 2D tangent + wedge vs. Arm 2) IMRT. RT dose 50/25 + optional 16 Gy electron boost.

***IMRT associated with decreased moist desquamation ), in inframammary fold (26% vs 43%). The breast volume (V95) is associated with acute skin toxicity.
***Outcome: Dose distribution: IMRT better. Moist desquamation anywhere in breast: IMRT 31% vs 2D 48% (SS), 26% vs. 43% (SS), no difference in pain 23% vs. 25% (NS) or QoL
***Conclusion: Breast IMRT reduced occurrence of moist desquamation

*'''Royal Marsden''' -- 2D vs. IMRT

***Change in breast: IMRT 40% vs. 2D 58% (SS); significantly fewer developed palpable induration. No difference in pain, hardness, or QoL
***Conclusion: Minimisation of inhomogeneity reduces late adverse effects

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Preface==
This page is designed to give you a little glimpse into the future of exactly what TI-89 BASIC is capable of performing. The following program is a game that displays a number on the screen and moves it around for 10 seconds. The object of the game is to memorize that number and then input it.

At first, the program in its entirety will be given (so that you have a chance to copy it to your calculator and test out what it does for yourself). Then, each block of code will be explained as to what it does so that you can get an idea of what it does. Before delving into the details of how it works, however, it may be best to finish reading the rest of this book so that you understand how the syntax and structure works.

==The program==
This program is called &quot;memory.&quot; If you wish to create it in your own calculator, go into the program editor, which can be reached by the following key presses: '''APPS'''+'''7'''+'''3'''. Make sure that the drop down is set to &quot;program&quot; and name it &quot;memory&quot; (a-lock should already be on, so you do not need to press the alpha button).

Also, this program was designed for the TI-89 and TI-89 Titanium. TI-92, TI-92+, and Voyager 200 may have different screen sizes or key mappings, and as such that will prevent this program from working correctly. If you would like to test this program and you have the TI-92, TI-92+, or Voyager 200, please leave a message on the [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|talk page]] with the screen resolution in pixels (horizontal x vertical) and what number the '''ENTER''' (or equivilant) key maps to.

Just a quick reference on some of the characters you will encounter here (again for the TI-89 and TI-89 Titanium): 
*'''©''' can be created by pressing '''♦''' + ''')'''
*'''&amp;''' can be created by pressing '''♦''' + '''×''' (the multiplication key)
*'''≤''' can be created by pressing '''♦''' + '''&lt;'''
*'''≥''' can be created by pressing '''♦''' + '''&gt;'''
*Text can be copied by pressing '''♦''' + '''↑''' (the shift key to capitalize text)
*Text can be pasted by pressing '''♦''' + '''ESC'''

The spaces after the colons are for readability only, it does not affect anything if you remove them.

==The explanation==
This section details how the above program works, broken down piece by piece. It may be best to read the rest of this book before reading this section, as basic structures and functionality will not be explained thoroughly here.

{{bcode:Example|1=
:memory(m)
:Prgm
:©NUMBER
}}
This defines the name of the program, what parameters it takes when called, specifies that it is a Program (not a Function), and tells the catalog listing help that the first parameter is a NUMBER.

{{bcode:Example|1=
:FnOff 1,2,3,4,5
:If m&gt;12 Then
:  Text &quot;Number too large&quot;
:  Stop
:EndIf
:If m&lt;1 Then
:  Text &quot;Number too small&quot;
:  Stop
:EndIf
}}
This turns off the first five functions on the graph screen, so that they will not be re-drawn while the program is running. Then, if the given number is too large (above 12) or too small (below 1), an error text box is displayed and the program execution is stopped

{{bcode:Example|1=
:int(m)­→n
:Lbl a
:ClrIO
:ClrDraw
:ClrGraph
:setGraph(&quot;Coordinates&quot;,&quot;OFF&quot;)
:setGraph(&quot;Grid&quot;,&quot;OFF&quot;)
:setGraph(&quot;Axes&quot;,&quot;OFF&quot;)
}}
This takes the floor of the given number (makes in an integer), so that only a whole amount of numbers gets displayed on screen. Then, it clears the I/O screen and Graph of all text/functions/drawings, and turns off the Coordinates, Grid, and Axes on the Graph so that the Graph screen is completely blank.

{{bcode:Example|1=
:int(rand()*10^n)­→x
:While x≤10^(n-1)
:  int(rand()*10^n)­→x
:EndWhile
:int(rand()*50)­→z
:rand(3)-2­→a
:rand(3)-2­→b
:0­→c
:rand(56)+10­→d
:rand(95-5*(n-8))+5­→e
}}
This initializes all of the variables. ''x'' is the number that will be displayed on-screen, so the first four lines (ending with the EndWhile) are a loop to make sure that ''x'' is of the correct length. ''z'' is how many pixels that the text will move in any one direction. ''a'' and ''b'' specify the direction the text is moving. ''a'' specifies vertical movement, so a value of -1 means it moves upwards, 0 means it does not move vertically, and 1 means it moves downwards. ''b'' specifies horizontal movement, so a value of -1 means it moves left, 0 means it does not move horizontally, and 1 means it moves right. ''c'' is a counter that increments by 1 every time the number moves one pixel. ''d'' and ''e'' are the vertical and horizontal starting points of the number (respectively).

{{bcode:Example|1=
:PxlText string(x),d,e
:PxlHorz 76
}}
This puts the number on the screen at the ''d'' and ''e'' coordinates from the above snippet. Then, it draws a horizontal line at the bottom of the screen. This line is the status bar for how much time the player has remaining to memorize the number being displayed.

{{bcode:Example|1=
:0­→p
:For y,0,50
:  getKey()­→k
:  If k=13 Then
:    Exit
:  EndIf
:  PxlOff 76,p
:  p+1­→p
:  PxlOff 76,p
:  p+1­→p
:  PxlOff 76,p
:  p+1­→p
:  If mod(y,10)=0 Then
:    PxlOff 76,p
:    p+1­→p
:  EndIf
}}
This sets ''p'' at 0 (''p'' is being used as a counter to see how to progress the status bar), then starts a loop that runs 51 times. At the beginning of the loop, a check is made for a keypress on the calculator's key pad. If the &quot;ENTER&quot; key is pressed, the loop is cut short and the part of the program where the user must type in the memorized number executes. Otherwise, it removes 3 or 4 pixels from the end of the status bar (3 normally, 4 if ''y'' -- the counter for the loop -- is evenly divisible by 10).

{{bcode:Example|1=
:  If c=z Then
:    int(rand()*50)­→z
:    0­→c
:    rand(3)-2­→a
:    rand(3)-2­→b
:  EndIf
:  c+1­→c
}}
This checks if the text has moved ''z'' pixels in the current direction, and if it has the text direction changes.

{{bcode:Example|1=
:  d+a­→d
:  If d&lt;10 Then
:    10­→d
:    z­→c
:  EndIf
:  If d&gt;60 Then
:    60­→d
:    z­→c
:  EndIf
:  e+b­→e
:  If e&lt;5 Then
:    5­→e
:    z­→c
:  EndIf
:  If e&gt;95-5*(n-8)+5 Then
:    95-5*(n-8)+5­→e
:    z­→c
:  EndIf
:  PxlText &quot;              &quot;,d-8,e-4
:  PxlText &quot; &quot;&amp;string(x)&amp;&quot; &quot;,d,e-4
:  PxlText &quot;              &quot;,d+8,e-4
:EndFor
}}
The beginning of this code is what actually &quot;moves&quot; the text. Two checks are made for both ''d'' (the vertical coordinate) and ''e'' (the horizontal coordinate) to make sure that the text hasn't moved to a spot where it would no longer be visible in its entirety. Then, it displays the text padded by spaces so that the previous text gets overwritten (instead of leaving a trail behind). After it displays the text, it either continues executing the loop or stops if the loop counter is 50.

{{bcode:Example|1=
:ClrDraw
:Input &quot;What is the number?&quot;,y
:If x=y Then
:  Disp &quot;Good Job!&quot;
:Else
:  Disp &quot;Sorry! The number was&quot;,string(x)
:EndIf
:Input &quot;Again? (0=no 1=yes)&quot;,x
:If x=1 Then
:  Goto a
:Else
:  DispHome
:EndIf
:EndPrgm
}}
This wipes the graph screen (so one cannot simply toggle back to it to see the number), then asks on the I/O screen for the number. Different text will display if the player inputs it correctly or incorrectly. Then, it asks if the player would like to try again. If they agree, it jumps back to the line saying &quot;Lbl a&quot;. If they do not agree, it displays the home screen then stops program execution

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Equilibrium ==

Before we can work with systems that have time dependent behavior, we must have a grasp of its counterpart. As you may have learned in your Statics class, a static system is defined as one which does not undergo any change with relation to the time it experiences. Virtually all problems an engineer solves start by evaluating the static characteristics of the system they are studying. This is done as a preliminary measure for further evaluation and can usually give insight and often help solve particular equations; in the least it offers another equation to work with in a case where more are needed to solve for variables. A static structure is one that is resistent to externally caused forces from deforming itself or by the act of sending forces within connections to the systems boundaries. With that understanding it can be said that the notion of a system in ''Equilibrium'' brings forth a useful conceptual tool, and will in turn lead to the notion of dynamic equilibrium, which is a formulation derived from Newton's second law of motion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As is no doubt seen in elementary Physics, the notion of '''vectors''', quantities that have a &quot;magnitude&quot; and a &quot;direction&quot; (whatever these may be) is very convenient in several parts of Physics. Here, we wish to put this idea on the rigorous foundation of Linear Algebra, to facilitate its further use in Physics. The interested reader is encouraged to look up the Wikibook [[Linear Algebra]] for details regarding the intricacies of the topic.

==Vector Spaces==
Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be [[w:Field|field]] and let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a set. &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''Vector Space over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;''' along with the binary operations of '''addition''' and '''scalar product''' iff

&lt;math&gt;\forall \mathbf{A},\mathbf{B},\mathbf{C}\in V&lt;/math&gt;

(i)   &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;  ...(Commutativity)

(ii)  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}+(\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{C})=(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B})+\mathbf{C}
&lt;/math&gt;  ...(Associativity)

(iii) &lt;math&gt;\exists\mathbf{0}\in V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{0}=\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; ...(Identity)

(iv)&lt;math&gt;\exists (\mathbf{-A})\in V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{-A}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; ...(Inverse)

&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;a,b\in F&lt;/math&gt;

(v) &lt;math&gt;(a+b)\mathbf{A}=a\mathbf{A}+b\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

(vi)&lt;math&gt;a(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B})=a\mathbf{A}+a\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

(vii)&lt;math&gt;a(b\mathbf{A})=(ab)\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

The elements of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are called '''vectors''' while the elements of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; are called '''scalars'''.  In most problems of Physics, the field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of scalars is either the set of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; or the set of complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.


Examples of vector spaces: 

(i) The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be visulaised as the space of ordinary vectors &quot;arrows&quot; of elementary Physics.

(ii) The set of all real polynomials &lt;math&gt;P(x)=a_0+a_1x+\ldots+a_nx^n&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

(iii) Indeed, the set of all functions &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is also a vector spaces over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, with addition and scalar multiplication defined as is usual.

Although the idea of vectors as &quot;arrows&quot; works well in most examples of vector spaces and is useful in solving problems, the latter two examples were deliberately provided as cases where this intuition fails to work.

==Basis==
A set &lt;math&gt;E\subset V&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''linearly independant''' if and only if 

&lt;math&gt;a_1\mathbf{E}_1+a_2\mathbf{E}_2+\ldots+a_n\mathbf{E}_n=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;a_1=a_2=\ldots=0&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_1,\mathbf{E}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{E}_n\in E&lt;/math&gt;


A set &lt;math&gt;E\subset V&lt;/math&gt; is said to '''cover &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;''' if for every &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\in V&lt;/math&gt; there exist &lt;math&gt;e_1,e_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=e_1\mathbf{E}_1+e_2\mathbf{E}_2+\ldots&lt;/math&gt;. (we leave the question of finiteness of the number of terms open at this point)


A set &lt;math&gt;B\subset V&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''basis''' for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; if  &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is linearly independant and if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; covers &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

If a vector space has a finite basis with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements, the vetor space is said to be '''n-dimensional'''


As an example, we can consider the vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; over reals. The vectors &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0);(0,1,0);(0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt; form one of the several possible basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. These vectors are often denoted as &lt;math&gt;\hat{i},\hat{j},\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt; or as &lt;math&gt;\hat{x},\hat{y},\hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;
===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space and let &lt;math&gt;B=\{\mathbf{b}_1,\mathbf{b}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{b}_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be a basis for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Then any subset of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; elements is linearly independant. 
====Proof====
Let &lt;math&gt;E\subset V&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;E=\{\mathbf{u}_1,\mathbf{u}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{u}_{n+1}\}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition of basis, there exist scalars &lt;math&gt;a_{1i},a_{2i},\ldots,a_{ni}&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;u_i=\displaystyle\sum_m a_{mi}\mathbf{b}_m&lt;/math&gt;

Hence we can write &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}c_i\mathbf{u}_i=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}c_ia_{mi}\mathbf{b}_m=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; that is

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^nc_1a_{1m}=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^nc_2a_{2m}=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^nc_{n+1}a_{3(n+1)}=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Which has a nontrivial solution for &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is linearly dependant.

If a vector space has a finite basis of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements, we say that the vector space is '''n-dimensional'''

==Inner Product==
An in-depth treatment of inner-product spaces will be provided in the chapter on [[Mathematical methods of Physics/Linear Algebra|Hilbert Spaces]]. Here we wish to provide an introduction to the inner product using a basis. 

Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;B=\{\mathbf{b}_1,\mathbf{b}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{b}_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be a basis for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Thus for every member &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, we can write &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n b_i\mathbf{b}_i&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; are called the '''component'''s of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the basis &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

We define the '''inner product''' as a binary operation &lt;math&gt;(\cdot) :V\times V\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{y}=\displaystyle\sum_i x_iy_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_i,y_i&lt;/math&gt; are the components of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;

Note here that the inner product so defined is intrinsically dependant on the basis. Unless otherwise mentioned, we will assume the basis &lt;math&gt;\hat{x},\hat{y},\hat{z}&lt;/math&gt; while dealing with inner product of ordinary &quot;vectors&quot;.

==Linear Transformations==
Let &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be vector spaces over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. A function &lt;math&gt;T:U\to V&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''Linear transformation''' if for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_1,\mathbf{u}_2\in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c\in F&lt;/math&gt; if

(i)&lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{u}_1+\mathbf{u}_2)=T(\mathbf{u}_1)+T(\mathbf{u}_2)&lt;/math&gt;

(ii)&lt;math&gt;T(c\mathbf{u}_1)=cT(\mathbf{u}_1)&lt;/math&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt;E=\{\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{e}_m\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F=\{\mathbf{f}_1,\mathbf{f}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{f}_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be bases for &lt;math&gt;U,V&lt;/math&gt; respectively. 

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e'}_i=T(\mathbf{e}_i)&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a basis, we can write &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e'}_i=\sum_j a_{ij}\mathbf{f}_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, by linearity we can say that if &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{u})=\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, we can write the components &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of those of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;v_j=\sum_i u_ia_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

The collection of coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''matrix''', written as 

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1m} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2m} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3m} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nm} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and we can say that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the bases &lt;math&gt;E,F&lt;/math&gt;

==Eigenvalue Problems==
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space over reals and let &lt;math&gt;T:V\to V&lt;/math&gt; be a linear transformations.

Equations of the type &lt;math&gt;T\mathbf{u}=\lambda\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;, to be solved for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}\in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are called '''eigenvalue problems'''. The solutions &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; are called '''eigenvalues''' of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; while the corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; are called '''eigenvectors''' or '''eigenfunctions'''. (Here we take &lt;math&gt;T\mathbf{u}=T(\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt;)

==Usage==
Template name: '''DROPBOX''' (currently identical functionality to DROPIMAGE).   Place text for a heading in parameter one position.  Place definitions for images, galleries, text, or an '''HTML''' table in parameter two position.   The content hides initially in the collapsed state, and drops when the link button is clicked.   The link toggles to collapse and expand the drop control.

The ''initial'' width of the control is not necessarily the ''dropped'' width, since the control expands to display the contents.   The '''width''' option sets the '''initial width'''.   the drop contents can contain links.   The template can be nested.

Three simple examples of its use, with results, are shown:

== Limitations ==
The '''width''' option sets the ''ititial'' width of the control.   It expands on opening, and has been observed to involve some overlap of adjacent structures.   This can be avoided by care in basic layout.   The '''width''' option should be set to avoid an overtight fitting of the '''caption'''.

Attempts at setting the ''vertical'' text alignment have so-far failed.

The content ''cannot'' be a Wikitext table, since the pipe symbols confuse the code; use an HTML table instead.

Bear in mind that the use of  '''&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;'''  tags will be needed for verbatim text layout, and if the block of text itself has these same tags within it, that the literals should be used to replace the  ones within the text.   (ie: use these instead;   '''&amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt;''' and '''&amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt;''').   This avoids the corrupted functioning which would otherwise result.

      <comment>moved [[Developing A Universal Religion/2. Possible Applications/6. Technological Singularity]] to [[User:Emesee/Technological Singularity]]: Makes no sense in book; was added following original outline.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The technological singularity is a theoretical point in the future of unprecedented technological progress, caused in part by the ability of machines to improve themselves using artificial intelligence.[1]

Statistician I. J. Good first wrote of an &quot;intelligence explosion&quot;, suggesting that if machines could even slightly surpass human intellect, they could improve their own designs in ways unforeseen by their designers, and thus recursively augment themselves into far greater intelligences. The first such improvements might be small, but as the machine became more intelligent it would become better at becoming more intelligent, which could lead to an exponential and quite sudden growth in intelligence.

Vernor Vinge later called this event &quot;the Singularity&quot; as an analogy between the breakdown of modern physics near a gravitational singularity and the drastic change in society he argues would occur following an intelligence explosion. In the 1980s, Vinge popularized the Singularity in lectures, essays, and science fiction. More recently, some prominent technologists such as Bill Joy, founder of Sun Microsystems, voiced concern over the potential dangers of Vinge's Singularity (Joy 2000). Following its introduction in Vinge's stories, particularly Marooned in Realtime and A Fire Upon the Deep, the Singularity has also become a common plot element throughout science fiction.

Others, most prominently Ray Kurzweil, define the Singularity as a period of extremely rapid technological progress. Kurzweil argues such an event is implied by a long-term pattern of accelerating change that generalizes Moore's Law to technologies predating the integrated circuit and which he argues will continue to other technologies not yet invented. Critics of Kurzweil's interpretation consider it an example of static analysis, citing particular failures of the predictions of Moore's Law. Others note that proponents of the &quot;singularity&quot; tend to ignore all of the negative impacts of technology, only focusing on the positive effects. The Singularity also draws criticism from anarcho-primitivism and environmentalism advocates.

Mathematician and author Vernor Vinge greatly popularized Good’s notion of an intelligence explosion in the 1980s, calling the creation of the first ultraintelligent machine the Singularity. Vinge first addressed the topic in print in the January 1983 issue of Omni magazine. Vinge (1993) contains the oft-quoted statement, &quot;Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly thereafter, the human era will be ended.&quot; Vinge refines his estimate of the time scales involved, adding, &quot;I'll be surprised if this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030.&quot;

Vinge continues by predicting that superhuman intelligences, however created, will be able to enhance their own minds faster than the humans that created them. “When greater-than-human intelligence drives progress,” Vinge writes, “that progress will be much more rapid.” This feedback loop of self-improving intelligence, he predicts, will cause large amounts of technological progress within a short period of time.

Most proposed methods for creating smarter-than-human or transhuman minds fall into one of two categories: intelligence amplification of human brains and artificial intelligence. The means speculated to produce intelligence augmentation are numerous, and include bio- and genetic engineering, nootropic drugs, AI assistants, direct brain-computer interfaces, and mind transfer.

Despite the numerous speculated means for amplifying human intelligence, non-human artificial intelligence (specifically seed AI) is the most popular option for organizations trying to advance the Singularity, a choice addressed by Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (2002). Hanson (1998) is also skeptical of human intelligence augmentation, writing that once one has exhausted the “low-hanging fruit” of easy methods for increasing human intelligence, further improvements will become increasingly difficult to find.

It is difficult to directly compare silicon-based hardware with neurons. But Berglas (2008) notes that computer speech recognition is approaching human capabilities, and that this capability seems to require 0.01% of the volume of the brain. This analogy suggests that modern computer hardware is within a few orders of magnitude as powerful as the human brain. It is also noted that the entire human genome is only about 750 megabytes of data, of which only 1.5% codes genes, most of which have nothing to do with intelligence. There is also only about 1% difference in the genes of a human and chimpanzee. This suggests that the &quot;software&quot; in the brain we are born with is relatively small—there is simply no storage space for a huge, arbitrary program.

One other factor potentially hastening the Singularity is the ongoing expansion of the community working on it, resulting from the increase in scientific research within developing countries.

Some critics assert that no computer or machine will ever achieve human intelligence while others do not rule out the possibility.[3] Theodore Modis and Jonathan Huebner argue that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining. Smart (2005) criticizes Huebner's analysis. Some evidence for this decline is that the rise in computer clock speeds is slowing, even while Moore's prediction of exponentially increasing circuit density continues to hold.

Others propose that other &quot;singularities&quot; can be found through analysis of trends in world population, world GDP, and other indices. Andrey Korotayev and others argue that historical hyperbolic growth curves can be attributed to feedback loops that ceased to affect global trends in the 1970s, and thus hyperbolic growth should not be expected in the future.

In &quot;The Progress of Computing&quot;, William Nordhaus argues that prior to 1940, computers followed the much slower growth of a traditional industrial economy, thus rejecting extrapolations of Moore's Law to 19th century computers. Schmidhuber (2006) suggests differences in memory of recent and distant events create an illusion of accelerating change, and that such phenomena may be responsible for past apocalyptic predictions.

Some anarcho-primitivism and eco-anarchism advocates, such as John Zerzan and Derrick Jensen, see the Singularity as an orgy of machine control, and a loss of free existence outside of civilization. Bell (2002, 2003) expresses a cautionary environmentalist perspective on the Singularity.

A recent study of patents per thousand persons shows that human creativity does not show accelerating returns, but in fact, as suggested by Joseph Tainter in his seminal &quot;The Collapse of Complex Societies[4]&quot; a law of diminishing returns.[citation needed] The number of patents per thousand peaked in the period from 1850–1900 and has been declining since.[citation needed] The growth of complexity eventually becomes self-limiting, and leads to a wide spread &quot;general systems collapse&quot;. Thomas Homer Dixon in &quot;The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization&quot; shows that the declining energy returns on investment has led to the collapse of civilizations. Jared Diamond in &quot;Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed&quot; also shows that cultures self-limit when they exceed the sustainable carrying capacity of their environment, and the consumption of strategic resources (frequently timber, soils or water) creates a deleterious positive feedback loop that leads eventually to social collapse and technological retrogression.

While discussing the Singularity's growing recognition, Vinge (1993) writes that &quot;it was the science-fiction writers who felt the first concrete impact.&quot; In addition to his own short story &quot;Bookworm, Run!&quot;, whose protagonist is a chimpanzee with intelligence augmented by a government experiment, he cites Greg Bear's novel Blood Music (1983) as an example of the Singularity in fiction. In William Gibson's 1984 novel Neuromancer, AIs capable of improving their own programs are strictly regulated by special &quot;Turing police&quot; to ensure they never exceed human intelligence, and the plot centers on the efforts of one such AI to circumvent their control. The 1994 novel The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect features an AI that augments itself so quickly as to gain low-level control of all matter in the Universe in a matter of hours. A more malevolent AI achieves similar levels of omnipotence in Harlan Ellison's short story &quot;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&quot; (1967). William Thomas Quick's novels Dreams of Flesh and Sand (1988), Dreams of Gods and Men (1989), and Singularities (1990) present an account of the transition through the Singularity; in the latter novel, one of the characters states that it is necessary for Mankind's survival that they achieve an integration with the emerging machine intelligences, or it will be crushed under the dominance of the machines—the greatest risk to the survival of a species reaching this point (and alluding to large numbers of other species that either survived or failed this test, although no actual contact with alien species occurs in the novels).

The Singularity is sometimes addressed in fictional works to explain the event's absence. Neal Asher's Gridlinked series features a future where humans living in the Polity are governed by AIs and while some are resentful, most believe that they are far better governors than any human. In the fourth novel, Polity Agent, it is mentioned that the Singularity is far overdue yet most AIs have decided not to partake in it for reasons that only they know. A flashback character in Ken MacLeod's 1998 novel The Cassini Division dismissively refers to the Singularity as &quot;the Rapture for nerds&quot;, though the Singularity goes on to happen anyway.

Popular movies in which computers become intelligent and overpower the human race include Colossus: The Forbin Project, the Terminator series, I, Robot, and The Matrix series. The television series Battlestar Galactica also explores these themes. See also List of fictional computers.

Isaac Asimov expressed ideas similar to a post-Kurzweilian Singularity in his short story &quot;The Last Question&quot;. Asimov's future envisions a reality where a combination of strong artificial intelligence and post-humans consume the cosmos, during a time Kurzweil describes as when &quot;the universe wakes up&quot;, the last of his six stages of cosmic evolution as described in The Singularity is Near. Post-human entities throughout various time periods of the story inquire of the artificial intelligence within the story as to how entropy death will be avoided. The AI responds that it lacks sufficient information to come to a conclusion, until the end of the story when the AI does indeed arrive at a solution, and demonstrates it by re-creating the universe, in godlike speech and fashion, from scratch. Notably, it does so in order to fulfill its duty to answer the humans' question.

St. Edward's University chemist Eamonn Healy discusses accelerating change in the film Waking Life. He divides history into increasingly shorter periods, estimating &quot;two billion years for life, six million years for the hominid, a hundred-thousand years for mankind as we know it&quot;. He proceeds to human cultural evolution, giving time scales of ten thousand years for agriculture, four hundred years for the scientific revolution, and one hundred fifty years for the industrial revolution. Information is emphasized as providing the basis for the new evolutionary paradigm, with artificial intelligence its culmination. He concludes we will eventually create “neohumans” which will usurp humanity’s present role in scientific and technological progress and allow the exponential trend of accelerating change to continue past the limits of human ability.

Accelerating progress features in some science fiction works, and is a central theme in Charles Stross's Accelerando. Other notable authors that address Singularity-related issues include Karl Schroeder, Greg Egan, Ken MacLeod, David Brin, Iain M. Banks, Neal Stephenson, Tony Ballantyne, Bruce Sterling, Dan Simmons, Damien Broderick, Fredric Brown, Jacek Dukaj, Nagaru Tanigawa and Cory Doctorow. Another relevant work is Warren Ellis’ ongoing comic book series newuniversal.

In the episode &quot;The Turk&quot; of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, John Connor mentions the Singularity. The Terminator franchise is predicated on the concept of a human-designed computer system becoming self-aware and deciding to destroy humankind - eventually it achieves superintelligence.

In the film Screamers - based on Philip K. Dick's short story Second Variety - mankind's own weapons begin to design and assemble themselves. Self replicating machines (here, the screamers) are often considered to be a significant prerequisite &quot;final phase&quot; - almost like a catalyst to the accelerating progress leading to a Singularity. Interestingly, screamers develop to a level where they will kill each other and one even professes her love for the human. This idea is common in Dick's stories, that explore beyond the simplistic &quot;man vs machine&quot; scenario in which our creations consider us a threat.

There is a feature-length documentary called Transcendent Man being made on Ray Kurzweil and his book The Singularity Is Near. The film documents Kurzweil's quest to reveal mankind's destiny.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You would like to monitor the service availability of several web sites or web services.  You would like to do this all with XQuery and store the results in XML files.  You would also like to see &quot;dashboard&quot; graphical displays of uptime.

There are several commercial services ([http://www.pingdom.com/ Pingdom], [http://host-tracker.com/ Host-tracker] )which will monitor the performance of your web sites in terms of uptime and response time. 

Although the production of a reliable service requires a network of servers, the basic functionality can be performed using XQuery in a few scripts.

== Method ==
This approach focuses on the uptime and response time of web pages.   The core approach is to use the eXist job scheduler to execute an XQuery script at regular time intervals.  This script performs a HTTP GET on a URI and records the statusCode of the site in an XML data file.

The operation is timed to gather response times from elapsed time (valid on a lightly used server) and the test results stored.  Reports can then be run from the test results and alerts send when a site is observed to be down.

Even though a prototype, the access to fine-grained data has already revealed some response time issues on one of the sites at the University.

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor3/index.xq Watch list]

== Conceptual Model ==

This ER model was created in QSEE, which can also generate SQL or XSD.

[[Image:XQueryMonitor3.jpg]]

In this notation the bar indicates that Test is a weak entity with existence dependence on Watch.

=== Mapping ER model to Schemas ===

==== Watch-Test relationship ====
Since Test is dependant on Watch, the Watch-Test relationship can be implemented as composition, with the multiple Test elements contained in a Log element which itself is a child of the Watch element. Tests are stored in chronological order.

==== Watch Composition ====
Two possible approaches:
* add the Log as a element amongst the base data for the Watch
   Watch
      uri
      name
      Log
         Test
* construct a Watch element which contains the Watch base data as WatchSpec and the Log
   Watch
      WatchSpec (the Watch entity )
         uri
         name
      Log

The second approach preserves the original Watch entity as a node, and also fits with the use of XForms, allowing the whole WatchSpec node to be included in a form. However it introduces a difficult-to-name intermediate, and results in paths like
   $watch/WatchSpec/uri 
when 
   $watch/uri would be more natural.

Here we choose the first approach on the grounds that it is not desirable to introduce intermediate elements in anticipation of simpler implementation of a particular interface.

==== Watch entity ====
A Watch entity may be implemented as a file or as an element in a collection.  Here we choose to implement Watch as a element in a Monitor container  in a document.  However this is a difficult decision and the XQuery code should hide this decision as much as possible.

==== Attribute implementation ====
Watch attributes are mapped to elements.  Test attributes are mapped to attributes.

==== Schema ====
===== Model Generated =====
QSEE will generate an [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor3/qseemonitor.xsd  XML Schema].  In this mapping, all relationships are implemented with foreign keys, with key and keyref used to describe the relationship.  In this case, the schema would need to be edited to implement the Watch-Test relationship by composition.

===== By Inference =====
This schema has been generated by Trang (in Oxygen ) from an example document, created as the system runs.

* Compact Relax NG
&lt;pre&gt;
    element Monitor {
        element Watch {
            element uri { xsd:anyURI },
            element name { text },
            element Log {
                element Test {
                    attribute at { xsd:dateTime },
                    attribute responseTime { xsd:integer },
                    attribute statusCode { xsd:integer }
                }+
            }
        }+
    }

&lt;/pre&gt;

* XML Schema 
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor3/trangmonitor.xsd  XML Schema]

==== Designed Schema ====
Editing the QSEE generated schema results in a schema which includes the restriction on statusCodes.

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor3/designmonitor.xsd  XML Schema]



==== Test Data ====

An XQuery script transforms an XML Schema (or a subset thereof) to a random instance of a conforming document.

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/XMLSchema/schema2instance.xq?file=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor3/designmonitor.xsd Random  Document]

The constraint that Tests are in ascending order of the attribute '''at''' is not defined in this schema. The generator needs to be helped to generate useful test data by additional information about the length of strings and the probability distribution of enumerated values, iterations and optional elements

=== Equivalent SQL implementation ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;

CREATE TABLE Watch(
	uri	VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
	name	VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT	pk_Watch PRIMARY KEY (uri)
) ;

CREATE TABLE Test(
	at	TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	responseTime	INTEGER NOT NULL,
	statusCode	INTEGER NOT NULL,
	uri	VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT	pk_Test PRIMARY KEY (at,uri)
) ;

ALTER TABLE Test
  ADD INDEX (uri), 
  ADD CONSTRAINT fk1_Test_to_Watch FOREIGN KEY(uri) 
                 REFERENCES Watch(uri) 
                 ON DELETE RESTRICT
                 ON UPDATE RESTRICT;

&lt;/source&gt;

In the Relational implementation the primary key '''uri''' of Watch is the foreign key of Test.  There would be an advantage to adding a system-generated id to use in place of this meaningful URI, both to remove the redundancy created and to reduce the size of the foreign key.  However a mechanism is then need to allocate unique ids.

== Implementation ==
=== Dependancies===
==== eXistdb modules ====
* xmldb for database update and login
* datetime for date formating
* util - for system-time function
* httpclient - for HTTP GET
* scheduler - to scheule the monitoring task
* validation - for database validation

==== other ====
* Google Charts


== Functions ==

Functions in a single XQuery module. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
module namespace monitor = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/monitor&quot;;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Database Access ==

Access to the Monitor database which may be a local database document, or a remote document.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function monitor:get-watch-list($base as xs:string) as element(Watch)* {
   doc($base)/Monitor/Watch
};

&lt;/source&gt;
A specific Watch entity is identified by its URI:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
  let $wl:= monitor:get-watch-list(&quot;/db/Wiki/Monitor3/monitor.xml&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Further references to a Watch are by reference. e.g.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function monitor:get-watch-by-uri($base as xs:string, $uri as xs:string) as element(Watch)* {
   monitor:get-watch-list($base)[uri=$uri]
};

&lt;/source&gt;

== Executing Tests ==

The test does an HTTP GET on the uri. The GET is bracketed by calls to util:system-time() to compute the elapsed wall-clock time in milliseconds. The test report includes the statusCode.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function monitor:run-test($watch as element(Watch)) as element(Test) { 
   let $uri := $watch/uri
   let $start := util:system-time()
   let $response :=  httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($uri),false(),())
   let $end := util:system-time()
   let $runtimems := (($end - $start) div xs:dayTimeDuration('PT1S'))  * 1000  
   let $statusCode := string($response/@statusCode)
   return
       &lt;Test  at=&quot;{current-dateTime()}&quot; responseTime=&quot;{$runtimems}&quot; statusCode=&quot;{$statusCode}&quot;/&gt;
};  

&lt;/source&gt;


The generated test is appended to the end of the log:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function monitor:put-test($watch as element(Watch), $test as element(Test)) {
    update insert $test into $watch/Log
};
&lt;/source&gt;

To execute the test, a script logs in, iterates through the Watch entities and for each, executes the test and stores the result:


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace monitor = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/monitor&quot; at &quot;monitor.xqm&quot;;

let $login := xmldb:login(&quot;/db/&quot;,&quot;user&quot;,&quot;password&quot;)
let $base := &quot;/db/Wiki/Monitor3/Monitor.xml&quot;
for $watch in monitor:get-watch-list($base)
let $test := monitor:run-test($watch)
let $update :=monitor:put-test($watch,$test) 
return $update

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Job scheduling ===

A job is schedule to run this script every 5 minutes

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $login := xmldb:login(&quot;/db&quot;,&quot;user&quot;,&quot;password&quot;)
return scheduler:schedule-xquery-cron-job(&quot;/db/Wiki/Monitor/runTests.xq&quot; , &quot;0 0/5 * * * ?&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Index page ==

The index page is based on a supplied Monitor document, by default the production database.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace monitor = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/monitor&quot; at &quot;monitor.xqm&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize  &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;
declare variable $heading := &quot;Monitor Index&quot;;
declare  variable $base := request:get-parameter(&quot;base&quot;,&quot;/db/Wiki/Monitor3/Monitor.xml&quot;);

&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;{$heading}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;{$heading}&lt;/h1&gt;
       &lt;ul&gt;
          {for $watch in  monitor:get-watch-list($base)
          return 
               &lt;li&gt;{string($watch/name)}&amp;#160;  &amp;#160; 
                        &lt;a href=&quot;report.xq?base={encode-for-uri($base)}&amp;amp;uri={encode-for-uri($watch/uri)}&quot;&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt;  
               &lt;/li&gt;
          }
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


&lt;/source&gt;

In this implementation, the URI of the monitor document is passed to dependent scripts in the URI.  An alternative would to pass this data via a session variable.

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor3/index.xq View]

== Reporting ==

Reporting draws on the log of Tests for a Watch

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

declare function monitor:get-tests($watch as element(Watch)) as element(Test)* {
    $watch/Log/Test
};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Overview Report ===
The basic report shows summary data about the watched URI and an embedded chart of response time over time.   Up-time is the ratio of tests with a status code of 200 to the total number of tests.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace monitor = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/monitor&quot; at &quot;monitor.xqm&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize  &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;

let $base := request:get-parameter(&quot;base&quot;,())
let $uri:= request:get-parameter(&quot;uri&quot;,())
let $watch :=monitor:get-watch-by-uri($base,$uri)

let $tests := monitor:get-tests($watch)
let $countAll := count($tests)
let $uptests := $tests[@statusCode=&quot;200&quot;]
let $last24hrs := $tests[position() &gt;($countAll - 24 * 12)]
let $heading := concat(&quot;Performance results for &quot;, string($watch/name))
return 
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;{$heading}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;h3&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;index.xq&quot;&gt;Index&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;{$heading}&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{$watch/uri}&quot;&gt;{string($watch/uri)}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        {if (empty($tests)) 
         then ()

            &lt;/tr&gt;

            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Uptime&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;{round(count($uptests) div count($tests)  * 100) } %&lt;/td&gt;

       &lt;/div&gt;
       }
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor/report.xq?uri=http://www.google.co.uk/ View]

=== Response time graph ===
The graph is generated using the [http://code.google.com/apis/chart/ Google Chart API]. The default vertical scale from 0 to 100 fits the typical response time. In this simple example, the graph is unadorned or explained.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function monitor:responseTime-chart($test as element(Test)* ) as element(img) {
   let $points := 
       string-join($test/@responseTime,&quot;,&quot;)
   let  $chartType := &quot;lc&quot;
   let $chartSize :=  &quot;300x200&quot;
   let $uri := concat(&quot;http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?&quot;,
                                       &quot;cht=&quot;,$chartType,&quot;&amp;amp;chs=&quot;,$chartSize,&quot;&amp;amp;chd=t:&quot;,$points)
   return 
        &lt;img src=&quot;{$uri}&quot;/&gt;  
};


&lt;/source&gt;

=== Response Time Frequency Distribution ===
The frequency distribution of response times summarised the  response times.  First the distribution itself is computed as a sequence of groups. The interval calculation is crude and uses 11 groups to fit with Google Chart.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function monitor:response-distribution($test as element(Test)* ) as element(Distribution) {
  let $times := $test/@responseTime
  let $min := min($times)
  let $max := max($times)
  let $range := $max - $min
  let $step := round( $range div 10)
  return
 &lt;Distribution&gt;
 {
      for $i in (0 to 10)
      let $low := $min + $i * $step
      let $high :=$low + $step
      return
           &lt;Group i=&quot;{$i}&quot; mid=&quot;{round(($low + $high ) div 2)}&quot; count=&quot;{ count($times[. &gt;= $low] [. &lt; $high]) }&quot;/&gt;
 }
&lt;/Distribution&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This grouped distribution can then be Charted as a bar chart.  Scaling is needed in this case.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function monitor:distribution-chart($distribution as element(Distribution)) as element(img) {
   let $maxcount := max($distribution/Group/@count)
   let $scale :=100 div $maxcount 
   let $points := 
       string-join( $distribution/Group/xs:string($scale * @count),&quot;,&quot;)
   let  $chartType := &quot;bvs&quot;
   let $chartSize :=  &quot;300x200&quot;
   let $uri := concat(&quot;http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?&quot;,
                                       &quot;cht=&quot;,$chartType,&quot;&amp;amp;chs=&quot;,$chartSize,&quot;&amp;amp;chd=t:&quot;,$points)
   return 
        &lt;img src=&quot;{$uri}&quot;/&gt;  
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally a Script to create a page:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace monitor = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/monitor&quot; at &quot;monitor.xqm&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize  &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;

let $base := request:get-parameter(&quot;base&quot;,())
let $uri:= request:get-parameter(&quot;uri&quot;,())
let $watch := monitor:get-watch($base,$uri)
let $tests := monitor:get-tests($watch)
let $heading := concat(&quot;Distribution for &quot;, string($watch/name))
let $distribution := monitor:response-distribution($tests)
return 

&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;{$heading}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;{$heading}&lt;/h1&gt; {monitor:distribution-chart($distribution)} &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;I &lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Mid&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Count&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt; {for $group in $distribution/Group return &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;{string($group/@i)}&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;{string($group/@mid)}&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;{string($group/@count)}&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt; } &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Validation ==
The eXist module provides functions for validating a document against a schema.  The Monitor document links to a schema:



&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $doc := &quot;/db/Wiki/Monitor3/Monitor.xml&quot;

return 
&lt;report&gt;
 &lt;document&gt;{$doc}&lt;/document&gt;
  {validation:validate-report(doc($doc))}
&lt;/report&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor3/validate.xq Execute]

Alternatively, a document can be validated against any schema:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $schema := &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor3/trangmonitor.xsd&quot;
let $doc := &quot;/db/Wiki/Monitor3/Monitor.xml&quot;

return 
&lt;report&gt;
 &lt;document&gt;{$doc}&lt;/document&gt;
  &lt;schema&gt;{$schema}&lt;/schema&gt;
  {validation:validate-report(doc($doc),xs:anyURI($schema))}
&lt;/report&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor3/validateschema.xq Execute]

This is used to check that the randomly generated instance is valid:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $schema := request:get-parameter(&quot;schema&quot;,())
let $file := doc(concat(&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/XMLSchema/schema2instance.xq?file=&quot;,$schema))
return 
 &lt;result&gt;
   &lt;schema&gt;{$schema}&lt;/schema&gt;
   {validation:validate-report($file,xs:anyURI($schema))}
   {$file}
&lt;/result&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor3/validaterandom.xq?schema=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Monitor3/monitor.xsd Execute]

== Downtime alerts ==

The purpose of a monitor is to alert those responsible for a site to its failure.  Such an alert might be by SMS, email or some other channel. The Watch entity will need to be augmented with configuration parameters.

=== Check if failed ===
First it is necessary to calculate whether the site is down. monitor:failing () returns true() if all tests in the past $watch/fail-minutes have not returned a statusCode of 200.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
 declare function monitor:failing($watch as element(Watch)) as xs:boolean  {
   let $now := current-dateTime()
   let $lastTestTime :=  $now - $watch/failMinutes * xs:dayTimeDuration(&quot;PT1M&quot;)
   let $recentTests := $watch/Log/Test[@at &gt; $lastTestTime] 
   return
        every $t in $recentTests satisfies 
              not($t/statusCode = &quot;200&quot;)    
   };
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Check if alert already sent ===
If this test is executed repetitively by a scheduled job, an Alert message on the appropriate channel can be generated.  However, the Alert message would be sent every time the condition is true.  It would be better to send an Alert less frequently. One approach would add Alert elements to the log, interspersed with the Tests. This does not affect the code which accesses Tests, but allows us to inhibit Alerts when one has been recently.  alert-sent() will be true if an alert has been sent in the last $watch/alert-minutes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function monitor:alert-sent($watch as element(Watch) as xs:boolean )  {
   let $now := current-dateTime()
   let $lastAlertTime := $now - $watch/alertMinutes * xs:dayTimeDuration(&quot;PT1M&quot;)
   let $recentAlerts := $watch/Log/Alert[@at &gt; $lastAlertTime] 
   return
       exists($recentAlerts)                                 
};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Alter notification task ===
The task to check the monitor log iterates through the Watches and for each checks if it is failing but no Alert has been sent in the period.  If so, a message is constructed and an Alert element is added to the Log.  The use of the Log to record Alert events means that no other state need to be held, and the period with which this task is executes is unrelated to the Alert period.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace monitor = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/monitor&quot; at &quot;monitor.xqm&quot;;
 
let $login := xmldb:login(&quot;/db/&quot;,&quot;user&quot;,&quot;password&quot;)
let $base := &quot;/db/Wiki/Monitor3/Monitor.xml&quot;
for $watch in monitor:get-watch-list($base)
return 
   if (monitor:failing($watch) and not(monitor:alert-sent($watch)))
   then 
       let $update := update insert &lt;Alert at=&quot;{current-dateTime()}&quot;/&gt; into $watch/Log
       let $alert := monitor:send-alert($watch,$message)
       return true()
   else false()

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Discussion ===
Alert events could be added to a separate AlertLog but it is arguably easier to add a new class of Events than create a separate sequence for each. There may also be cases where the sequential relationship between Tests and Events is useful.

* add create/edit Watch 
* detect missing tests
* Support analysis for date ranges by filtering tests by date prior to analysis
* improve the appearance of the charts

:I'm pretty sure that's an underspecified problem.  Knowing the lengths of all four sides of a quadrilateral is not enough information to set its shape (the angles can vary).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some excellent work has been done on this book and I surprised by the lack of contributors, well done! May I suggest a couple of things from a teachers point of view?

The sections that are in place in this book are sensible conceptual topics, however, they do not fully reflect the structure of the course and in some respects follow a more traditional route through education. The best selling point of the IOP advancing physics course is the angle on relevance in each topic. Is there a reason for the structure currently in place? --[[User:Smcintosh|Smcintosh]] ([[User talk:Smcintosh|talk]]) 19:18, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

Thank you for your comments. My main motivation in writing this book is to give an alternative approach to the content in the syllabus to the standard materials used to teach the course. A quick search of the internet will reveal the fact that many people are not happy with the course simply because it is so relevant to everything outside of physics that its approach to physics itself suffers. In writing this wikibook, I have tried to provide clear explanations of the facts which will be needed in the exams, providing those studying the course with an easy-to-use resource which does not hide the facts amongst lengthy discourses on the history, philosophy, beauty and sometimes obscure applications of physics. I am not saying these things do not have value - just that a resource is needed which places its emphasis on physics, not on other things which should be subservient to physics in a physics textbook. --[[User:Sjlegg|Sjlegg]] ([[User talk:Sjlegg|talk]]) 08:46, 12 July 2008 (UTC)


Irrelevant discussion removed. The paragraph was basically a whine about the course and therefore personal oppinion unrelated to this book --[[User:Smcintosh|Smcintosh]] ([[User talk:Smcintosh|talk]]) 10:59, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

If the point of your book is to provide a alternative method of teaching I will leave it alone, It would be nice if the title of the book reflected it is an alternate approach. I was looking for a free version of the book to supporting pupils or schools who can not afford to proved pupils with the text at £18 a copy. --[[User:Smcintosh|Smcintosh]] ([[User talk:Smcintosh|talk]]) 10:59, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

Since this Wikibook is not a copy of any other textbook, it is inevitable that it will do things differently from other textbooks. The only ways I know of to provide an £18 textbook for free are illegal. This Wikibook does try and cover the specification, but it is not endorsed by any official body. Also, there is no substitute for a teacher, who can provide tuition to pupils as individuals, and do practical work and coursework with them. --[[User:Sjlegg|Sjlegg]] ([[User talk:Sjlegg|talk]]) 11:44, 30 June 2009 (UTC)

5. The antiparticle of the electron (e-) is the positron. What is the charge and rest mass of a positron?

Charge: +1.6 x 10-19C

Mass: 0.511 MeV = 8.176 x 10-14 kg
==================================
Is the rest mass actually the same of that of the electron?:
9.10938215(45)×10−31 kg
=======================
as per:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron
{{unsigned|86.17.231.68|18 December 2011}}

Well spotted. That diagram is really bad, I only just noticed: the units are wrong. Where it says &quot;MeV&quot;, it should say &quot;MeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;. I'll see what I can do about fixing it.--[[User:Sjlegg|Sjlegg]] ([[User talk:Sjlegg|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sjlegg|contribs]]) 10:59, 19 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

-----------
A ''topological manifold'' &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of real dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a paracompact separable Hausdorff topological space, where, for any &lt;math&gt;x \in M&lt;/math&gt;, there is a neighborhood ''U'' of ''x'' and a homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(U)&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;R^n&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, or more precisely, the pair (\phi, 

equipped with an ''atlas'', a collection of pairs of an open subset &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;\tau_j: U_j \to \tau_j(U_j)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following conditions:
* (i) &lt;math&gt;\tau_j(U_j)&lt;/math&gt; is an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; are a locally finite open cover of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
* (ii) &lt;math&gt;\tau_{jk} = \tau_j \circ \tau^{-1}_k&lt;/math&gt;
In the above, &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''coordinate patch'', and &lt;math&gt;\tau_j&lt;/math&gt; a ''charts'' on &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt;. For each point &lt;math&gt;x \in M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau_j(p)&lt;/math&gt;, (which is an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;), is called a local coordinates at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. (ii) means that local coordinates are compatible in the sense: If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are local coordinates at the same point but are given by &lt;math&gt;\tau_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_k&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, then &lt;math&gt;x = \tau_{jk} (y)&lt;/math&gt;.

------------
A ''fiber bundle'' &lt;math&gt;(E, B, \pi, F)&lt;/math&gt; consists of topological spaces E, B and F, and a continuous function &lt;math&gt;\pi: E \to B&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;F \longrightarrow E \overset{\pi}\longrightarrow B \longrightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;
is exact. E, B and F are called the ''total space'', ''base space'' and ''fiber space'', respectively. Unless stated otherwise, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be connected.

In practice, we are usually given a pair &lt;math&gt;(B, F)&lt;/math&gt; and are asked to specify a pair &lt;math&gt;(E, \pi)&lt;/math&gt;. A trivial example of a fiber bundle, simply called a trivial bundle, can be defined as follows: let &lt;math&gt;E = B \times F&lt;/math&gt; and define &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\pi(x, v) = x&lt;/math&gt;. Locally, this is how a fiber bundle looks like. To give a more concrete example, take &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to be a circle and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a line segment. The trivial bundle of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is then just a cylinder. A Möbius strip is another different fiber bundle that is not a trivial bundle.

A ''manifold'' &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of real dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a paracompact Hausdorff second-countable topological space equipped with an ''atlas'', a collection of pairs of an open subset &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;\tau_j: U_j \to \tau_j(U_j)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following conditions:
* (i) &lt;math&gt;\tau_j(U_j)&lt;/math&gt; is an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; are a locally finite open cover of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
* (ii) &lt;math&gt;\tau_{jk} = \tau_j \circ \tau^{-1}_k&lt;/math&gt;
In the above, &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''coordinate patch'', and &lt;math&gt;\tau_j&lt;/math&gt; a ''charts'' on &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt;. For each point &lt;math&gt;x \in M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau_j(p)&lt;/math&gt;, (which is an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;), is called a local coordinates at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. (ii) means that local coordinates are compatible in the sense: If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are local coordinates at the same point but are given by &lt;math&gt;\tau_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_k&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, then &lt;math&gt;x = \tau_{jk} (y)&lt;/math&gt;.

One important thing to note is that a manifold is given with the specific dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. More axiomatic approach can be used to give a definition of manifold with no specific dimension.

Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is said to be &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt; ''differentiable'' if &lt;math&gt;\tau_j&lt;/math&gt; is a differomorphism (i.e., a differentiable bijection with differentiable inverse.) A ''tangent vector'' &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p \in M&lt;/math&gt; is a differential operator of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \sum_j a_j {\partial \over \partial x_j}&lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; are a local coordinates at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.) By &lt;math&gt;T_p M&lt;/math&gt; we mean the linear space spanned by the basis &lt;math&gt;\partial \over \partial x_j&lt;/math&gt;. The dual space of &lt;math&gt;T_p M&lt;/math&gt; we denote by &lt;math&gt;T^*_p M&lt;/math&gt;.

We now give a more abstract but direct definition of &lt;math&gt;T^*_p M&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be the ideal of all smooth functions in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; that vanish at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I^2&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all functions of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_k f_k g_k&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f_k, g_k \in I&lt;/math&gt;. We then let &lt;math&gt;T^*_p M = I / I^2&lt;/math&gt;. The obvious advantage of this definition is that the manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; need not be differentiable; in fact, the definition was motivated by an approach in algebra geometry; see [[w:Zariski tangent space]] for this. (Note that since the second dual of &lt;math&gt;T_p M&lt;/math&gt; can be identified with &lt;math&gt;T_p M&lt;/math&gt;, this definition allows us to define &lt;math&gt;T_p M&lt;/math&gt; as the dual of &lt;math&gt;T^*_p M&lt;/math&gt;.)

The ''cotangent bundle'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;T^*M&lt;/math&gt;, is a fiber bundle with the base space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and the fiber space being . The elements of T^*M are called ''one-forms''. A ''differential k-form'' or just ''k-form'' is a map from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k \otimes T^* M&lt;/math&gt;

For a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, a differential &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt;df(v) = v(f)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;v \in T_p M&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;dx_j(v) = a_j&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;v = \sum_k a_k {\partial \over \partial x_k}&lt;/math&gt;, we can write more explicitly:
:&lt;math&gt;df = \sum_k {\partial f \over \partial x_k} dx_k&lt;/math&gt;
The map that sends &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, is called a ''differential map''. It satisfies the usual rule of differentiation of products:
:&lt;math&gt;d(fg) = f dg + df g&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; is called a differential of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Note that not every element of &lt;math&gt;T^*M&lt;/math&gt; is a differential of a function.

Let &lt;math&gt;(M, g)&lt;/math&gt; be an oriented &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt; Riemann manifold. We define the inner product
:&lt;math&gt;\langle f_1 \wedge ...   \wedge f_p, g_1 \wedge ...   \wedge g_p \rangle = \operatorname{det} (\langle f_j, g_k \rangle)_{j, k}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f_j, g_k \in T^* M&lt;/math&gt;

We now give a (far-reaching) generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

'''Theorem (Stokes' formula)'''
:''&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial K} u = \int_K du&lt;/math&gt;''
Proof: First assume &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; has compact support. A direct computation then give the formula. For the general case, use a partition of unity.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; (TODO: need, apparently, a much more detail.)

A hermitian manifold &lt;math&gt;(X, h)&lt;/math&gt; is called a Kähler manifold if &lt;math&gt;Im h&lt;/math&gt; is d-closed.

''''Theorem (the vanishing of the Nijenhuis tensor)''' ''The following are equivalent.''
*''Nijenhuis tensor vanishes.''
*''&lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial} \circ \bar{\partial} = 0&lt;/math&gt;''
*''&lt;math&gt;d = \partial + \bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Iwo Jima==

The Battle of Iwo Jima was fought between the Japanese army and the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The battle, known to the USMC as &quot;Operation Detachment&quot;, started on 19 February 1945 and lasted until 26 March 1945 when the last Japanese soldiers were captured or killed. This was the first battle of the war fought on the Japanese &quot;home islands&quot; and the fighting was very fierce.

The Japanese had built deep bunkers to protect themselves, with tunnels so that they could move safely between the bunkers. There were many large hidden guns protecting the island.

===The battle===
[[File:Pre-invasion bombardment of Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|right|The battle begins with ships firing at the island]]
The battle started when US ships began to fire their guns at the island. Then nearly 100 aircraft attacked, dropping their bombs on the Japanese positions.  Then the ships fired again and again. These attacks did not hurt the Japanese much as they were hidden safely in their bunkers. When the ships had stopped firing, the Marines began landing on the beaches. The Japanese waited until many men were on the beach before beginning to fire machine guns at them.

Slowly the Marines moved forward, but they had trouble getting the Japanese out of the bunkers. Each time they thought a bunker was empty, more Japanese would run along the tunnels into the bunker and start shooting again. 

The fighting was very fierce and the Marines moved slowly. The Japanese bunkers were too strong for the Marines' guns, so they had to use flamethrowers and grenades instead. They also had eight tanks with flamethrowers that were used against tough bunkers.

The US Navy had aircraft carriers nearby. Fighter aircraft from these carriers supported the Marines by shooting up the Japanese whenever they could and by dropping bombs.

As the battle continued, the Japanese began to run out of water and food.  They became desperate and began to launch crazy attacks at night. In the end they were all either killed or wounded.

===Raising the flag===

[[File:USMC Memorial Silhouette.jpg|thumb|right|The monument at Arlington National Cemetery based on the famous &quot;Raising the Flag&quot; photograph]]

At the end of the battle, the Marines raised the US flag, or Stars and Stripes, on the island. A famous photograph of the flag raising was taken. This photograph was used to design a monument at the US national cemetery where US soldiers are buried.

===Aftermath===

Of the 22,000 Japanese Soldiers defending the island only 216 of them survived, most of them badly hurt. As was normal in the war, hardly any Japanese soldiers surrendered - most fought to the death.

Of the 70,000 American Marines there were 27,909 casualties, with 6,825 killed. 

==Okinawa==

The Battle of Okinawa was fought between the United States, Britain, their allies and the Japanese. It was also known as Operation Iceberg. It started in April 1945 and ended on June 21, 1945. This battle was a large and fierce fight. 

===Before the battle===

The aim of the battle was to capture a large island close to Japan. After many earlier island battles, the US and its allies were getting nearer to Japan. The plan was to use Okinawa once it was captured as a base to attack Japan itself.

===The battle===

===Aftermath===

More than 100,000 Japanese soldiers and 17,000 Americans Marines and sailors were killed as well as many thousands of people living on the islands. In fact nearly a quarter of the population died. 

Most of the buildings on the island were completely destroyed.

The island was very useful to the allies and it was used by warships to anchor. Many airfields were built so that airplanes could attack Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a textbook of common methods of applied mathematics that are often used by physicists. Knowledge of basic calculus and analysis is assumed. Although the book covers all the linear algebra required, it is recommended that the reader have at least some previous exposure to this subject. Familiarity with topology and measure theory/functional analysis may be helpful in some of the later chapters. Exposure to introductory level physics is sufficient. 

Authors are encouraged to maintain the level of mathematics as &quot;fairly rigorous&quot;, to minimise the amount of hand-waving. Thus the reader will be at an advantage if he/she has experience with mathematical proofs. 

Wikibooks that may be useful prerequisites:

      <text xml:space="preserve">The purpose of any exercise is to steadily develop skills and to acquire the automatic algorithms for fulfilling certain operations. As for the SQL language, practical exercises are intended to enable the database programmer to quickly devise SQL queries in order to solve practically any problem, by having already studied similar problems in exercises. This book provides such a collection of practical solved SQL exercises.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section we shall consider the vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; over reals with the basis &lt;math&gt;\hat{x},\hat{y},\hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;.

We now wish to deal with some of the introductory concepts of vector calculus. 

==Vector and Scalar Fields==
====Definition====
Let &lt;math&gt;C:\mathbb{R}^3\to F&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a field. We say that &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a '''scalar field'''

In the physical world, examples of scalar fields are 

(i) The electrostatic potential &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in space

(ii) The distribution of temperature in a solid body, &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

====Definition====
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}:\mathbb{R}^3\to V&lt;/math&gt;, we say that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a '''vector field'''; it associates a vector from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; with every point of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. 

In the physical world, examples of vector fields are 

(i) The electric and magnetic fields in space &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}(\mathbf{r}),\vec{B}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

(ii) The velocity field in a fluid &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

==The Gradient==
Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a scalar field. We define the '''gradient''' as an &quot;operator&quot; &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; mapping the field &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; to a vector in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; such that 

&lt;math&gt;\nabla C=\left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial x},\frac{\partial C}{\partial y},\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, or as is commonly denoted &lt;math&gt;\nabla C=\frac{\partial C}{\partial x}\hat{x}+\frac{\partial C}{\partial y}\hat{y}+\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}\hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;small&gt;We shall encounter the physicist's notion of &quot;operator&quot; before defining it formally in the chapter '''Hilbert Spaces'''. It can be loosely thought of as &quot;a function of functions&quot;&lt;/small&gt;

====Gradient and the total derivative====
Recall from multivariable calculus that the '''total derivative''' of a function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the linear transformation &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{|\mathbf{h}|\to 0}\frac{f(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{h})-f(\mathbf{a})-A\mathbf{h}}{|\mathbf{h}|}=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


In the usual basis, we can express as the row matrix &lt;math&gt;f'(\mathbf{a})=A=\displaystyle\begin{pmatrix}
\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial x} &amp; \tfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} &amp; \tfrac{\partial f}{\partial z}\\
\end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

It is customary to denote vectors as column matrices. Thus we may write &lt;math&gt;\nabla f=\displaystyle\begin{pmatrix} \tfrac{\partial f}{\partial x} \\ \tfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} \\
\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial z} \\ \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The transpose of a matrix given by constituents &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix with constituents &lt;math&gt;a^T_{ij}=a_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the gradient is the transpose of the total derivative.
==Divergence==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}:\mathbb{R}^3\to \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; be a vector field and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable. 

We define the '''divergence''' as the operator &lt;math&gt;(\nabla\cdot )&lt;/math&gt; mapping &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; to a scalar such that 

&lt;math&gt;(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{F})=\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial F_z}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

==Curl==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}:\mathbb{R}^3\to \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; be a vector field and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable. 

We define the '''curl''' as the operator &lt;math&gt;(\nabla\times )&lt;/math&gt; mapping &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; to a ''linear transformation from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; onto itself'' such that the linear transformation can be expressed as the matrix 

&lt;math&gt;(\nabla\times\mathbf{F})_{ij}=\frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_i}-\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_j}&lt;/math&gt; written in short as &lt;math&gt;(\nabla\times\mathbf{F})_{ij}=\partial_iF_j-\partial_jF_i&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,x_3&lt;/math&gt; denote &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; and so on.

the curl can be explicitly given by the matrix: &lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{F}=\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; \partial_1 F_2-\partial_2 F_1 &amp; \partial_1 F_3-\partial_3 F_1 \\
\partial_2 F_1-\partial_1 F_2 &amp; 0 &amp; \partial_2 F_3-\partial_3 F_2 \\
\partial_2 F_1-\partial_1 F_3 &amp; \partial_3 F_2-\partial_2 F_3 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

this notation is also sometimes used to denote the vector '''exterior''' or '''cross product''', &lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{F}=(\partial_2 F_3-\partial_3 F_2)\hat{x}+(\partial_1 F_3-\partial_3 F_1)\hat{y}+(\partial_1 F_2-\partial_2 F_1)\hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The use of logic in proving mathematical statements ==

Theorems in rigorous mathematics often take on the form of implications or equivalences, therefore it is important to know how to go about prove such statements. 

=== Implications ===
Looking at the truth table for implications we see that &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is always true when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false. When &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is true, only when &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is true and false otherwise. Therefore, proving an implication we only need to prove (by using the rules of logical inference) that &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is true when we assume &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to be true. 

Beginning a proof an implication &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, we will always write &quot;'''Let''' &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be true.&quot; or just &quot;'''Let''' &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, and then use the above rules of inference to derive &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

Often, conjunctions occur in the hypothesis of an implication when the truth of two or more statements imply the truth of the conclusion. Disjunctions sometimes occur in in the conclusion of implications as in the Fredholm alternative.

=== Equivalence ===
As we have shown above, the equivalence &lt;math&gt;P\Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(P\Rightarrow Q)\land(Q\Rightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;, so proving that both implications, &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q\Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;, are true (as explained in the previous paragraph) is sufficient to assert the truth of &lt;math&gt;P\Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; (by adjunction). 

Writing the proof of an equivalence is always done in two parts. We will write &quot;We first prove &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and then proceed to prove the statement, after which we write &quot;Conversely, we now prove &lt;math&gt;Q\Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and then prove that statements.

Often one of the constituent implications of the equivalence is trivial, while the other is not.

=== Proof by contradiction (Reductio ad absurdum) ===
Proof by contradiction is a very important method of proof. Proving, by contradiction, that a statement &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, we will assume that it is false and then derive by the above rules of logical inference the truth of a statement which is clearly false. Since we assert consistency - that statements can only be either true or false - there must be a problem with our argument. This problem is the assumption that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, therefore &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must be true.

To begin a proof by contradiction we will write &quot;We will prove that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true. '''Suppose''', to the contrary that &lt;math&gt;\lnot P&lt;/math&gt; is true&quot;. Then by logical inference and the assumption we derive the truth of a statement &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; which will clearly be false, at which point we will write &quot;But &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is in contradiction with &lt;math&gt;\lnot Q&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must be true.&quot;

{{dynamic navigation
|title=&lt;math&gt;\int \sec^3 x \, dx = \frac{1}{2}\sec x \tan x + \frac{1}{2}\ln|\sec x + \tan x| + C.&lt;/math&gt;
|body= This [[:w:antiderivative|antiderivative]] may be found by [[:w:integration by parts|integration by parts]], as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \int \sec^3 x \, dx = \int u\,dv &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
u &amp;{}= \sec x, \\
dv &amp;{}= \sec^2 x\,dx, \\
du &amp;{}= \sec x \tan x\,dx, \\
v &amp;{}= \tan x.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int \sec^3 x \, dx &amp;{}= \int u\,dv \\
&amp;{}= uv - \int v\,du \\
&amp;{} = \sec x \tan x - \int \sec x \tan^2 x\,dx \\
&amp;{}= \sec x \tan x - \int \sec x\, (\sec^2 x - 1)\,dx \\
&amp;{}= \sec x \tan x - \int \sec^3 x \, dx + \int \sec x\,dx.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Next we add &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{}\int\sec^3 x\,dx&lt;/math&gt; to both sides of the equality just derived:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
2 \int \sec^3 x \, dx &amp;{}= \sec x \tan x + \int \sec x\,dx \\
&amp;{}= \sec x \tan x + \ln|\sec x + \tan x| + C.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then divide both sides by 2:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \sec^3 x \, dx = \frac{1}{2}\sec x \tan x + \frac{1}{2}\ln|\sec x + \tan x| + C.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Create a Web Page==

Even if you do not already have a website it is quite simple to put your quiz online.  There are many different ways to do this without having any technical knowledge or having to pay for someone else’s expertise.

There are many free website creation sites online, you can easily find them in any search engine.  Before you go too far in setting up your new website make sure that you can load all the files that are needed to run your quiz.  Be warned, while there are probably more that will let load the .swf files that you need to run a single quiz, finding one that will permit you to load .html files is a bit more difficult.  

These files are needed to create a single link and run multiple random generated quizzes. So if you are using the '''Randomize''' option you will need to create a website where you can upload .html files.


===Using Spanglefish===

A free website provider that will allow the upload of .html files is [[http://www.spanglefish.com/|'''Spanglefish.com''']].

The site creation is not automated, but the team at Spanglefish react very speedily (less than 10 minutes in my case) to the requests for new sites.

Once you have your site created you can download their own online manual to help with creating pages and editing text, although it is very straightforward.

To put your quiz online, you first of all need to open the '''Library''' page where you can upload your files.  To start with this will not be a visible page, to make it visible you go to the '''Switch Pages On/Off''' tab in '''Site Admin''' and select '''Visible''' for the Library page.

 
[[Image:QW3 Spanglefish page settings.png|center]]


Once in the Library page you can easily upload your quiz files.  If you are going to be uploading a lot of files to your website you will probably want to create a folder for the quiz.
 

[[Image:QW3 Spanglefish doc library admin.png|center]]


You do this by clicking on the '''New Folder''' button.  
 

[[Image:QW3 Spanglefish new folder.png|center]]

When you are ready, click on the '''Upload File''' button.  A window will pop up asking where you want to upload the document to, you browse and select the appropriate folder.

[[Image:QW3 Spanglefish document folder.png|center]]
 

When you click '''Continue''' you will be able to browse for the Question Writer files that you need.  
 

[[Image:QW3 Spanglefish browse.png|center]]


Remember to upload all the files created when you published your quiz - there should be at least 3.


[[Image:QW3 Spanglefish loaded.png|center]]

 
Once you have finished uploading the files you will probably want to make the Library page invisible to your public and only accessible to those with administrator privileges on your web page.  This is achieved in the '''Switch Pages On/Off''' tab in Site Admin, this time choose '''Protected'''.


[[Image:QW3 Spanglefish page settings 2.png|center]]

 
You can add a link to your quiz as part of your home page, or by creating a new page:
 

[[Image:QW3 Spanglefish add text.png|center]]


In the editing box click on the '''hyperlink''' symbol


[[Image:QW3 Spanglefish hyperlink.png|center]]
 

And browse in '''other''' to find the .html file that you just uploaded.
 

[[Image:QW3 Spanglefish link to file.png|center]]


Your quiz is now loaded and available online.

You can see the web page created for this tutorial at http://www.spanglefish.com/questionwriter/

Question Writer supports the import of questions from text files. These may be saved from MS Word in .txt or .rtf files or from Notepad, but you must follow the format as described on this page.
 
Question Writer text import supports the following question types:

*Multiple Choice
*Multiple Response
*True or False
*Paragraph
*Fill in the Blank
*Matching
*Explanation
*Sequencing
*Partial Credit

The import format for multiple choice questions has required elements and optional elements, each of which is described below. This is followed by an explanation of the formatting required for true-false, paragraph, short answer, matching and multiple response questions.

As well as importing the question and answer text you can also import your question feedback and any image that you wish to include in the question.{{clr}}
|}


===Multiple Choice (required elements)===

Each question must begin with a question number with dot “.” or parentheses ”)”.  There must be at least one space between the number and question wording. 

	Example:		&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;3) Who was the 1st president of USA?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Example:		&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;3. Who was the 1st president of USA?&lt;/font&gt;


Each answer choice must start with a letter (a-z) and dot ”.” or parentheses “)”. 


&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;	a. Bill Clinton&lt;br&gt;
			b. Richard Nixon&lt;br&gt;
			c. Thomas Jefferson&lt;br&gt;
			d. George Washington&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

===Multiple Choice (optional elements)===

====Title====

Each question can include a title.  The title will be included as part of the question body. The title must be placed before the question wording and prefaced by “Title:”.&lt;br&gt;  
Example:	

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Title: 1st president of USA

3) Who was the 1st president of USA?&lt;br&gt;
a. Bill Clinton&lt;br&gt;
b. Richard Nixon&lt;br&gt;
c. Thomas Jefferson&lt;br&gt;
d. George Washington&lt;/font&gt;

'''Correct''' answers can be indicated in two ways:

*An asterisk character “*” can be placed in front of the correct choice (no space between it and ordering letter)
*A list of correct answers can be placed at the end of a quiz file. Its start is indicated with a keyword “Answers:“. Answer should be placed directly following this line (no blank lines between!). These answers are the last element of a document, everything that is placed after answers will be ignored.

Example:&lt;br&gt; 	
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Answers:&lt;br&gt;
1. A&lt;br&gt;
2. D&lt;br&gt;
3. D&lt;br&gt;
4. C&lt;/font&gt;

If you do not provide any answers, Question Writer will set the correct answer as the first option by default.

====Question Feedback====

Another optional element is question feedback. This can be placed right after the question. Feedback for a correct answer must start with “@” character. It must be followed be a space!

Example:&lt;br&gt; 	
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Title: 1st president of USA&lt;br&gt;
3) Who was the 1st president of USA?&lt;br&gt;
a. Bill Clinton&lt;br&gt;
@ No. He was 42nd president!&lt;br&gt;
b. Richard Nixon&lt;br&gt;
@ Far away… he was 37th…&lt;br&gt;
c. Thomas Jefferson&lt;br&gt;
@ Close, but still not right – he was the 3rd president of the United States.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;d. George Washington&lt;br&gt;
@ Exactly!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
 
Feedback doesn’t need to be specified for every available option. Also, general feedback for the whole question can be placed right after the question wording – before the first choice. It is also prefaced by a “@” character with a space for Incorrect answer feedback and by a &quot;~&quot; for correct answer feedback.

Example: &lt;br&gt;	
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Title: 1st president of USA&lt;br&gt;
3) Who was the 1st president of USA?&lt;br&gt;
~ Correct, George Washington was the 1st president. He took the office on April 30, 1789 and left it on March 4, 1797. He was not a member of any party.&lt;br&gt;
@ No, in fact George Washington was the 1st president. He took the office on April 30, 1789 and left it on March 4, 1797. He was not a member of any party.&lt;br&gt;
a. Bill Clinton&lt;br&gt;
b. Richard Nixon&lt;br&gt;
c. Thomas Jefferson&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;d. George Washington&lt;/font&gt;

====Importing an Image with the Question====

You can include an image for display with the question by adding:

Example: &lt;br&gt;	
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[img: &quot;filename.jpg&quot;]&lt;/font&gt;

immediately after the question number.  The image must be saved in the same folder as the text file for importing.

===Importing Multiple Response Questions===

Simply follow the guidance for Multiple Choice questions and indicate all the correct answer options.  Question Writer will recognise this as a Multiple Response question.

===Importing True or False Questions===

Importing &quot;true or false&quot; questions is similar to importing multiple choice questions (see above). These examples show the right way to do it.

Example: &lt;br&gt;	
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;3) Was George Washington the 1st president of USA?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;a) True&lt;br&gt;
b) False&lt;/font&gt;

Example: &lt;br&gt;	
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;3) Was George Washington the 1st president of USA?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;a. T&lt;br&gt;
b. F&lt;/font&gt;
 
The “True” or “T” choice must be placed first, before the “False” or “F” answer. This helps the Question Writer to correctly identify the question as true or false question type. If the order is different, the question will be interpreted as a multiple choice question.

Other elements of a question (title, feedback) can be added in the same way as described above for multiple choice. The same rules apply when indicating the correct answers.

===Importing Essay Questions===

When importing an essay question, all elements must be prefaced by an expression “Type:P”.&lt;br&gt; 
Example:&lt;br&gt; 	
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Type: P&lt;br&gt;
Title: Richard Nixon resignation.&lt;br&gt;
4.  Why did Richard Nixon resign from the presidency?&lt;/font&gt;

Question Writer doesn’t support sample answers for essay questions, so the answer should be left blank.

Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;a) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example:&lt;br&gt; 	
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Answers:&lt;br&gt;
1. A&lt;br&gt;
2. B&lt;br&gt;
3. C&lt;br&gt;
4. &lt;br&gt;
5. B&lt;/font&gt;

===Importing Fill in the Blank Questions===

Fill in the Blank questions must begin with a “Type:S” expression. All other parts of a question are handled in the same way.&lt;br&gt; 
Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Type: S&lt;br&gt;
Title: Election in 1961?&lt;br&gt;
5. Who was elected as the 35th president of USA in 1961?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Question Writer allows only one correct answer for each question, but it allows multiple forms of that answer.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt; 	
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Type: S&lt;br&gt;
Title: Election in 1961?&lt;br&gt;
5. Who was elected as the 35th president of USA in 1961?&lt;br&gt;
a. JFK&lt;br&gt;
b. John F. Kennedy&lt;br&gt;
c. John Fitzgerald Kennedy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Answers can also be placed at the end of document, in a similar way to multiple choice questions.

Multiple forms of an answer are indicated by repeating the question number.&lt;br&gt;
Example: &lt;br&gt;	
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Answers:&lt;br&gt;
…&lt;br&gt;
4. A&lt;br&gt;
5. JFK&lt;br&gt;
5. John F. Kennedy&lt;br&gt;
5. John Fitzgerald Kennedy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

===Importing Matching Questions===

The process of importing a &quot;matching&quot; question is again similar to importing multiple choice questions, but there are some key differences. The first line of formatting must start with &quot;Type: MT&quot;. 

Each answer (which contains both portions of a match) must begin with a letter followed by a dot &quot;.&quot; or a parentheses &quot;)&quot;.  Both parts are separated by an “=” character. Each pair should not contain new line characters, blanks etc.

Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Type: MT&lt;br&gt;
Title: Presidents and parties&lt;br&gt;
4) Match the correct president and political party he was a member of.&lt;br&gt;
a. Dwight D. Eisenhower = Republican&lt;br&gt;
b. Woodrow Wilson = Democratic&lt;br&gt; 
c. William H. Harrison = Whig&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Spaces before or after the &quot;=&quot; symbol are optional, but it is important that an answer only uses it for a purpose of separation. If you plan to list correct answers for other questions at the bottom of the document, simply skip the number for all questions that are of the matching variety.

===Importing Explanation Questions===

This kind of question should be prefaced with “EX” character in the type section. 

Example: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Type: EX&lt;br&gt;
Title: Quiz explanation.&lt;br&gt;
4.  You have 10 minutes for all questions – please be accurate and fast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

This question type shouldn’t have a particular answer specified, so it must be left blank just like the answer for paragraph question.

===Importing Sequencing Questions===

To import a sequencing question, use the ‘Type: SEQ’:

Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Type: SEQ&lt;br&gt;
Title: Italian cities’ population.&lt;br&gt;
5. Order these Italian cities by population – largest population at the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;A.	Rome&lt;br&gt;
B.	Milan&lt;br&gt;
C.	Naples&lt;br&gt;
D.	Turin&lt;br&gt;
E.	Palermo&lt;br&gt;
F.	Genoa&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

The correct answer is indicated by the way in which the elements are ordered. If you plan to list correct answers for other questions at the bottom of the document, skip the number for any sequencing questions.

===Importing Partial Credit Questions===

Partial credit question type must be prefaced with a type declaration &quot;Type: PC&quot;.

The maximum number of answers that can be selected can also be defined. The syntax of this part is = Max{x} where x is the integer. If no maximum is declared, the default value is 1. Note: This doesn’t need to be the number of correct answers, just the maximum number the user may select.

Each of answers must be followed by a “=” sign and the number of points. If there are no points specified, the default value is 0.

Example:

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Type: PC&lt;br&gt;
Title: Example partial credit question.&lt;br&gt;
6. Which of the following answers is the most correct? = Max{2}&lt;br&gt;
a. The best answer = 10&lt;br&gt;
b. More or less fine = 5&lt;br&gt;
c. Not too good = 1&lt;br&gt;
d. Wrong! = 0&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Partial credit questions can also include general feedback. However it is only possible to define the correct answers (and points) for Partial Credit questions in the question, not at the end of the document.

===Sample Import File===

You can find a sample of an .rtf document containing questions on the Question Writer Website [http://www.questionwriter.com/samples/sampleimport.zip].  You can use this to try out importing questions to a quiz, or even as a template to prepare your own questions and answers for importing.

You can also export or [[../../../Save and Publish/Publish your Quiz/Publish Questions in Text Format|publish a file in text format]], and use that file as a reference for future import files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why the heavy emphasis on Shakespeare here instead of the designated subject title of literary criticism? In my literary criticism class, Shakespeare barely came up, not because he was left out, but because he wrote no literary criticism. I think the topics ought to address the subject heading, literary criticism (what it is, how to do it, etc.), rather than all the emphasis on one author. How strange! There is an entire Wikibook section devoted to Shakespeare, I see. Wouldn't much of the excellent material that was placed here better serve if it were located there instead?</text>

== [[Science Fiction Literature]] ==

I noticed that you put the subpages in the Wikibooks namespace. Subpages of a book belong in the same namespace as the rest of the book, that is in the book/module/main namespace. The Wikibooks namespace isn't for books or subpages of a book. I've gone ahead and fixed this for you. There isn't a need to include &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; before your links like on Wikipedia if that is what you were thinking, rather than linking to a page in the book/module/main namespace on Wikibooks like it would from Wikipedia it links to different namespace. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:29, 28 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, I am a bureaucrat at the English Wikibooks. You had registered the username Maxim, but have made
*0 edits, and
*0 log entries.

Since you are inactive at Wikibooks, we are considering giving your username to someone else who uses that username on other wikis. To do this, we will change your username to Maxim (usurped). If you return to Wikibooks you are of course welcome to change your username again to just about anything you like. We do this to allow active users to have the same username on all the wikis we operate.

If you do not want us to change your username, please respond within 7 days of this email, and we will discuss possible compromises.

Thanks

what are two types of measurement?

==Re: Vector quantities==
IT IS BETTER TO DEFINE A SCALAR TO BE A QUANTITY THAT REMAINS INVARIANT UNDER ADMISSIBLE CO-ORDINATE TRANSFORMATION DECTATED BY THE CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE OF THINKING.TO BE MORE EXPLICIT,CONSIDER THE EQUATION M=M(0)/square rootof(1-v squared/c squared).here M(0)IS A SCALAR QUANTITY;BUT M IS NOT A SCALAR QUANTITY.IT MAY BE VIEWED AS ONE OF THE COMPONENT OF ENERGY-MOMENTUM 4- VECTOR.IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO SAY THAT SCALAR IS A TENSOR OF ZERO RANK.ALSO IT IS ALWAYS SAFE TO SAY THAT A VECTOR IS AN ELEMENT BELONGING TO A VECTOR SPACE OVER THE FIELD OF REAL NUMBERS.(if we are dealing with real linear vectorspace).

      <comment>/* Just three models are needed for a solid background */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===Many things have changed..===
Many things have evolved in the domain of CDRs during the recent decades, and –as a consequence- so has the work of the CDR engineers.&lt;br&gt;
*Unit cost. The CDR  is often just a small section of a complex but tiny silicon chip. More than one CDR can be found inside the chip, and it may even happen that a series of almost identical ones, differing slightly in some critical circuit elements, are made inside the same chip. Just one of those CDRs will actually be used. The characteristics of certain critical circuit elements can not be chosen exactly in the first place because of their manufacturing variability. The one in the series that will come out of production better balanced is the one that is chosen. The other are left unused with little concern for their cost that is practically negligible.
*Quantity manufactured of each design. On one side the unit cost declines with the improvement of the manufacturing technology, on the other each design happens to be manufactured in larger and larger quantities, following the trend of modern electronics.
*Circuit complexity. Each circuit element can today be implemented using blocks of really complex circuitry, and there are more and more cases when the (slow speed) functions are made by dedicated software rather than by hardware.
*Frequency. From MHz to GHz. The widespread use of media with THz of useful bandwidth, like the optical fiber, opens every day possibilities of higher speed applications. In parallel, the accuracy of the reference frequency has evolved from hundreds of  ppm to ten ppm or less, and consumer electronics with frequency accuracy of the reference oscillator below 1 ppm are becoming common use.
*Application specific CDR. General purpose CDRs have disappeared. In new systems and equipment, the CDR is defined for a very precise application. If the application is subject to change with the operating conditions of the equipment, more CDRs are present and the one best fitting the requirement is activated at any moment.
*CAD tool versatility. For high level description, synthesis, simulations as well as for design for testability and for automatic generation of test software of the resulting circuit.
*Test equipment versatility. The circuit can be stimulated, checked, characterized, troubleshooted to an extent that was unconceivable not many years ago.

===Engineers can become lazy or neglect theory===
The CDR engineer has become more and more dependent on predefined solutions of parts of his circuits, on software for simulation and circuit synthesis, on characterization and test equipment.&lt;br&gt;
The engineer becomes specialized for just one task in the complex organization that deploys so many CDRs in the world.&lt;br&gt; 
The negative side of all this is the possibility to lose the ability to understand the circuit behavior. The need for an engineer to understand the CDR with its own intelligence may be neglected, and just hardware and software tools may be relied upon.&lt;br&gt;
Such extremes may be rare, but it is not infrequent to find good technical literature on CDRs that could be improved if the author had a better knowledge and more command of the fundamental mathematical models.

===Just three models are needed for a solid background===
'''“All models are wrong; some models are useful”'''  ([[wikipedia: W. Edwards Deming|W. Edwards Deming]])

In the case of CDRs, it might be reworded as: “All CDR models are wrong; there are three models that are useful”&lt;br&gt;
Many problems can be solved better, or quicker –if not avoided altogether-, if the engineer is familiar with and uses three simple mathematical models, because the fundamental behavior of every CDR can be referred to one of them:
#The phase aligner (1&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;t order, 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; type)
#The regenerator (2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order, 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; type)
#The robust, tolerant monolithic implementation with bang-bang detector and ring VCO (2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order, 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; type).
&lt;br /&gt;
These three structures (1-1, 2-1, 2-2) out of two architectures (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order) are the ones used in practice. How to choose among them?
&lt;center&gt;'''The choice depends on whether the phase comparator (and/or the VCO) is linear or not'''&lt;/center&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;The 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order loop  models can be characterized by one parameter  only,  e.g.  ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt;, where ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; =  G =  1/τ.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;The 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loops models can be characterized by two parameters only,  e.g.  ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; and ζ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;''(in these 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loops ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; can be expresed as a function of the other two parameters)''&lt;/small&gt;.

&lt;br clear=all&gt;


*For the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loops, ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; can be expresed as a function of the other two parameters. For the 2-1 and 2-2 loops :
&lt;center&gt; &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt; / 2 &amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; ;  &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; =  2 &amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n22&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''e.g. if ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; ,  then,  ζ = ½''.&lt;/center&gt;
*&lt;u&gt;If&lt;/u&gt; the filtering caracteristics ( &lt;u&gt;τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;  or   τ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/u&gt; ) &lt;u&gt;are kept fixed&lt;/u&gt;, and just the open &lt;u&gt;loop gain is varied&lt;/u&gt;, then the behaviour of &lt;u&gt;the two 2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;u&gt;order loops&lt;/u&gt; is different, &lt;u&gt;almost &quot;opposite&quot;&lt;/u&gt;:
::2-1	 ω&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = G / τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and '''ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =1 / ( 4 G τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)'''&lt;br /&gt;
:::the 2-1 gets less damped with more gain, i.e. more damped with less gain.
::2-2	 ω&lt;sub&gt;n22&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = G / τ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; and '''ζ&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = G τ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; / 4''' &lt;br /&gt;
:::the 2-2 gets more damped with more gain, i.e.less damped with less gain !&lt;br /&gt;
:This opposite behavior of  ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; and of  ζ&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to the loop gain G explains why 
:::2-1  is not used with bang-bang phase detectors nor VCOs, while 
:::2-2  (not preferred whith phase comparator and VCO of linear type) becomes the preferred choice with bang-bang phase detectors (and VCOs).
*The interesting characteristics of the 2-1 (rejection of the signal jitter, that make it preferred for regenerator applications) depends on a good control of the damping ratio, ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; . ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, in turn, depends on the loop gain G and decreases when G increases (risk of jitter peaking!): &amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =1 / ( 4 G &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;).
:The gain of the non linear blocks (bang bang detector and bang-bang VCO) is not constant, but varies with the signal amplitude. In particular, the bang-bang gain is maximum when the signal at the input of the blocks deviates least from its center value. The gain is minimum instead when the signal deviates most from its center value.

[[File:Static gain of comparators.png|thumb||center|660px|&lt;center&gt;Transfer curve and gain of the linear and of the bang-bang comparators as a function of the phase difference at their inputs&lt;/center&gt;]]

*It is important to emphasize that the “instantaneous” gain of a bang-bang phase detector in a CDR never reaches the highest values of the its static characteristics, because the jitter present in the incoming signal is never exactly zero for any significant interval of time.
:Even when acquisition is achieved, some input jitter is present and the average output of the phase detector jitters from left to right and back, along the high slopes of the characteristic curve, but is never able to settle at the very top (which would only happen if jitter was constantly = 0). &lt;br /&gt;
:The very high gain of the non-linear blocks at small signal amplitudes tends to reduce to a (often) negligible value Es, for all structures. Some may be faster in acquisition and in squeezing Es, but all squeeze it at the end of the acquisition phase.&lt;br /&gt;

*On the other hand, even if not infinite, such high gain deteriorates the jitter rejection.
:The jitter cut off frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; increases with G (proportionally in the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order loop, quadratically in the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loops)
:''In the 2-1 loop there is even the additional adverse effect of jitter amplification around ω&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt; as soon as  ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; becomes lower than 0.707!!''


'''As a result, the three fundamental structures find their best fit as follows:'''
# ''' 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order'''
::'''linear or non-linear blocks; preferred when E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is zero by definition (= for phase aligners). Preferred when the acquisition time shall be minimum (burst-mode transmission). Furthermore, it is a good choice in many cases when there are no specific requirements that suggest a 2nd order loop.'''
#  '''2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order'''
##'''2.1  type 1: preferred for regenerator applications when linear blocks are used.'''
##'''2.2  type 2: preferred for  applications where non-linear (= widely variable gain) blocks are used and in particular where the low frequency noise of the VCO  must be reduced.'''

&lt;big&gt;'''Diarrhea'''&lt;/big&gt;


*low fiber diet
*[[w:Sandostatin|Sandostatin]]
*[[w:Paregoric|Paregoric]]


'''''Prophylaxis:'''''
*5-ASA drugs (oral):
**Mesalamine (Asacol, Pentasa) - is 5-ASA without side chains
**Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) - 500 mg BID
**Balsalazide (Colazal) - 3 x 750 mg tabs BID (i.e. 2250 mg twice a day)
***Prodrug cleaved in the colon to mesalamine.
**Olsalazine - 2 5-ASA molecules bound
*5-ASA enemas, foams


'''''Selenium'''''
*'''Lippe Hospital, Germany''' (2000-2006) -- selenium vs control
**Randomized. 81 patients with uterine (88%) or cervical (12%) cancer. If pretreatment selenium &lt;84 ug/l randomized to Arm 1) selenium 500 ug PO daily vs Arm 2) control. Primary endpoint: efficiency of supplementation
**'''2010''' PMID 20133068 -- &quot;Multicenter, Phase 3 Trial Comparing Selenium Supplementation With Observation in Gynecologic Radiation Oncology.&quot; (Muecke R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Feb 2. [Epub ahead of print])
***Outcome: Selenium level post RT significantly higher with supplement. Grade 2+ diarrhea selenium 20% vs no selenium 44% (SS). No difference in other measures
***Conclusion: Selenium supplementation effective in improving blood selenium status in deficient patients, and reduces RT-induced diarrhea


'''''Octreotide'''''
*'''RTOG 0315''' (2003-2006) -- octreotide vs placebo
**Randomized. 215 patients, rectal or anal cancer. Arm 1) long-acting octreotide 30 mg given 4-7 days before RT, and again day 22 vs Arm 2) placebo. Primary endpoint Grade 2+ diarrhea
**'''2010''' PMID 20339140 -- &quot;Octreotide acetate in prevention of chemoradiation-induced diarrhea in anorectal cancer: randomized RTOG trial 0315.&quot; (Zachariah B, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010 Apr 21;102(8):547-56. Epub 2010 Mar 25.) Median F/U 10 months
***Outcome: Grade 2-4 acute diarrhea octreotide 44% vs placebo 49% (NS). No difference in chemotherapy delivery, RT delivery, medical resource utilization, bowel function or QoL
***Conclusion: Prophylactic use of octreotide had no benefit

&lt;big&gt;'''Proctitis Management'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Acute radiation proctitis==
*Timing: during and within 6 weeks of RT
*Symptoms: diarrhea and rectal urgency or tenesmus, bleeding not as common
*Course: usually resolve within 2-6 months
*No specific therapy required; no prophylactic measures successful


===Sucralfate Prophylactic===
*'''Multi-institutional, 2001''' (Australia)(1995-1997) PMID 11597802 -- &quot;The effect of oral sucralfate on the acute proctitis associated with prostate radiotherapy: a double-blind, randomized trial.&quot; (Kneebone A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Nov 1;51(3):628-35.)
**Randomized. 338 patients with localized prostate CA. Randomized to 1) 3g oral sucralfate suspension BID during RT or placebo; balanced but placebo group more liquid baseline stools
**Outcome: No difference in stool frequency, consistency, flatus, mucus, or pain. More bleeding in sucralfate group (64% vs. 47%, SS)
**Conclusion: No difference for oral sucralfate

*'''North Central Cancer Treatment Group, 2000''' PMID 10715293 -- &quot;Sucralfate in the prevention of treatment-induced diarrhea in patients receiving pelvic radiation therapy: A North Central Cancer Treatment Group phase III double-blind placebo-controlled trial.&quot; (Martenson JA, J Clin Oncol. 2000 Mar;18(6):1239-45.)
**Randomized. 123 patients, pelvic RT to minimum 45 Gy +/- oral sucralfate 1.5g q6 hours
**Outcome: fecal incontinence (16% vs. 34%, SS), need for protective clothing (8% vs. 23%, SS) worse with sucralfate, otherwise no difference
**Conclusion: sucralfate didn't improve bowel toxicity, and may have aggravated some GI symptoms

*'''TROG, 1997''' (Australia) PMID 9424000 -- &quot;A phase III double-blind randomised study of rectal sucralfate suspension in the prevention of acute radiation proctitis.&quot; (O'Brien PC, Radiother Oncol. 1997 Nov;45(2):117-23. 
**Randomized. 86 patients with localized prostate CA. Treated with 1) daily 3.0g sucralfate enema in 15 mL suspension vs. 2) suspension alone. RT 64/32. (See below for long-term proctitis results)
**Outcome: Grade 2 proctitis sucralfate 61% vs. placebo 71% (NS). No difference in time-to-onset or duration, or quality of life
**Conclusion: Sucralfate enema not helpful in reducing acute radiation proctitis


===Misoprostol Prophylactic===
*'''Goettingen, 2005''' (Germany) PMID 16137837 -- &quot;A phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of misoprostol rectal suppositories to prevent acute radiation proctitis in patients with prostate cancer.&quot; (Hille A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Dec 1;63(5):1488-93.)
**Randomized. 100 patients with prostate CA. RT +/- misoprostol suppositories
**Outcome: No differences in proctitis symptoms, onset, or duration. More rectal bleeding in misoprostol group
**Conclusion: Misoprostol not helpful


==Chronic radiation proctitis==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
{{clr}}


*Timing: 9-14 months after RT, but sometimes after 2 years (and as late as 30 years)
*Etiology: obliterative endarteritis and chronic mucosal ischemia, leading to progressive epithelial atrophy and fibrosis. Ultimately, development of a chronically ischemic intestine prone to fibrosis and bleeding
*Symptoms: diarrhea, obstructed defecation (if strictures), bleeding, rectal pain, rectal urgency, and fecal incontinence. Rarely fistulas, SBO
*Diagnosis: colonoscopy, barium studies if suspecting strictures and fistulas
*Treatment:
**Stool softeners - consider if mild obstructive symptoms
**Dilation - consider if stool softeners not effective in obstructive symptoms
**Sulfasalazine - disappointing results
**Sucralfate enema - no benefit in prophylaxis; good response in radiation proctitis
**Hyperbaric oxygen - some benefit for fecal urgency and bleeding
**Metronidazole - benefit for bleeding and rectal ulcers
**Formaldehyde - induction of coagulative necrosis; beneficial for bleeding
**Endoscopy (Argon plasma coagulation) - benefit for bleeding
**Surgery - reserved for intractable symptoms



===Sucralfate Therapeutic===
*'''Chandigarh, 1991''' (India) PMID 1670631 -- &quot;Radiation-induced proctosigmoiditis. Prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of oral sulfasalazine plus rectal steroids versus rectal sucralfate.&quot; (Kochhar R, Dig Dis Sci. 1991 Jan;36(1):103-7.)
**Randomized. 37 patients with RT-induced proctosigmoiditis. Treate with 1) 3.0g oral sulfasalazine x4 weeks + 20 mg BID rectal prednisolone enama vs. 2) 2.0g BID rectal sucralfate enema 
**4-week outcome: both groups significant clinical and endoscopic improvement; sucralfate enema clinically significantly better clinically, same endoscopically
**Conclusion: both treatments effective; sucralfate enemas better clinical response and cheaper


===Sucralfate Prophylactic===

&lt;big&gt;'''Esophageal Toxicity Management'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Toxicity and Dosimetry==
*''Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Toxicity/Esophagus|Esophagus Toxicity]] section for information about toxicity grading and dosimetric considerations


==Treatment Overview==
*Symptomatic relief
**Topical anesthetics (e.g. viscous lidocaine)
**NSAID analgesics
**Narcotic analgesics
**Ca++ blocker if spasm a component
**Proton pump inhibitor if GERD a component
*Nutritional support
**IV fluids
**G-tube feeding
**TPN
*Sucralfate may be helpful, but clinical trials inconclusive


==Prevention==
===Sucralfate===
*'''NCCTG''' (1993-1994) -- Sucralfate suspension vs placebo
**Randomized. 97/100 patients undergoing mediastinal RT. Arm 1) Sucralfate suspension 1g/30 ml QID during and for 2 weeks after RT vs. Arm 2) placebo
**'''1997''' PMID 9060568 -- &quot;Placebo-controlled trial of sucralfate for inhibiting radiation-induced esophagitis.&quot; (McGinnis WL, J Clin Oncol. 1997 Mar;15(3):1239-43.)
***Outcome: No difference in RTOG esophagitis score or self-reported questionnaire scores
***Toxicity: GI toxicity sucralfate 58% vs. placebo 14% (SS); medication stopped 40% vs. 4% (SS)
***Conclusion: No benefit for oral sucralfate solutions, with significant side effects

===Amifostine===
*'''Greece Multicenter''' (1997-1999) -- amifostine vs control
**Randomized. 97 patients with advanced lung CA, undergoing definitive RT 55-60 Gy. No concurrent chemotherapy. Arm 1) amifostine 340 mg/m2 QD 15 min prior to RT vs. Arm 2) control
**'''2001''' PMID 11704311 -- &quot;Randomized phase III trial of radiation treatment +/- amifostine in patients with advanced-stage lung cancer.&quot; (Antonadou D, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Nov 15;51(4):915-22.)
***Pneumonitis: Grade 2+ amifostine 9% vs. control 43% (SS); Grade 2+ lung damage 16% vs. 49% (SS); 6-month rate of fibrosis 28% vs. 53% (SS)
***Esophagitis: Grade 2+ amifostine 4% vs. 42% (SS)
***Outcome: 2-month PR/CR amifostine 75% vs. control 76% (NS)
***Conclusion: Amifostine reduces pneumonitis, lung fibrosis, and esophagitis without compromising efficacy 

===Glutamine===
*'''Barcelona; 2007''' (Spain) PMID 17531398 -- &quot;Prevention of radiochemotherapy-induced esophagitis with glutamine: results of a pilot study.&quot; (Algara M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Oct 1;69(2):342-9. Epub 2007 May 24.)
**Prospective. 75 patients with lung CA. Prophylactic glutamine powder 10g TID. RT 65-70 Gy
**Outcome: no esophagitis in 49% of concurrent chemo-RT and 73% of sequential chemo-RT patients
**Dosimetry: Grade 2+ esophagitis if V50 &lt;=30% risk 22% vs. V50 &gt;30% risk 71% (SS)
**Conclusion: Oral glutamine may have role in prevention of esophageal complications</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Amyloidosis'''&lt;/big&gt;


*Characterized by deposition of insoluble protein fibers in tissues, leading to tissue dysfunction
*Usually a systemic disease with widespread protein deposition, although rare localized forms exist


'''''Tracheobronchial Amyloidosis'''''
*'''Mayo Clinic; 2007''' (1999-2004) PMID 17625086 -- &quot;External beam radiation therapy for tracheobronchial amyloidosis.&quot; (Neben-Wittich MA, Chest. 2007 Jul;132(1):262-7.)
**Retrospective. 7 patients with tracheobronchial amyloidosis. EBRT 20/10 to trachea starting just below vocal cords to both mainstem bronchi, 1.5 cm radial margin. Median F/U  3.3 years
**Outcome: Subjective improvement 100%. Time-to-improvement 1 month - 1 year. Recurrence in 1 patient after 17 months
**Toxicity: Grade 2 esophagits 1 patient, Grade 2 pneumonitis 1 patient
**Conclusion: EBRT safe and can provide symptomatic improvement</text>

'''There are ''two'' different sets of style rules in use;''' a set of HTML attributes that is associated with the specific elements in tables, and a Cascading Style Sheet set, CSS properties, that is of more general use.

Each of ''table'', ''caption'', ''row'', and ''cell'' can be considered as separate ''elements'' in the more general building of tables.  In each case where an attribute refers to the same format as a CSS property at the same level of the same element, the CSS property takes priority.     

A short list of each style-set is given for quick reference though these listings are by no means complete.   A link has been provided at the bottom of this drop-list for a full CSS properties reference.

'''Style Expression Spacing Rules for WIKITEXT'''
----
'''Main Points to Avoid'''

*Line breaks are ''not'' permitted ''within'' style expressions.   Let the software do the wrapping.
*Spaces are not permitted immediately ''before'' colons or semi-colons. 

'''These have Latitude'''

*Space between the various table symbols and the word ''style'' is OK.
*Space around any ''equals'' symbol is OK.
*Space between the style rules and their ''outside'' parentheses is OK.
*Spaces ''after'' colons and semi-colons are OK.
*A semi-colon can be placed immediately ''after'' the last style rule.

'''In addition'''

*Compound values like '2px solid black' ''must'' be space-separated.
*HTML attributes ''must'' be separated from CSS style expressions with space.
*HTML ''element'' line-spacing is permitted but not for Wikitext elements.  
*Wikitext and HTML table elements ''can'' be indented for clarity.
*Long lines in code LISTINGS can wrap ''only'' if there are some spaces added.
----
----


'''Combining the two style rule methods:'''

It is possible to mix the attributes with CSS styles provided that they keep to their own local formats.
That is to say; nothing with an equals sign between the quotes, and no CSS rules outside
of them.   Note that the Wiki apostrophe codes and various HTML tags can still be used directly on text.  An example of mixed styles is shown below.

&lt;pre style=&quot;border:1px solid dimgray;background:white;font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
{| border=1 width=300px style=&quot;background:lightyellow;color:maroon;&quot;
| height=100px| &lt;u&gt;''First''&lt;/u&gt; cell
| style=&quot;background:black;color:white;&quot; width=200px align=center|''Second'' cell
|}&lt;/pre&gt;


'''Priorities for Inline Styles.'''   

When there is a contest at the same level between an attribute and a style, the ''style will have priority''.

When two similar properties exist in a style expression, each having a different value, the ''second'' value will be taken.

When there are two ''entire'' style expressions in the same table line, the second is ''ignored''.   The same situation applies for two similar attributes in a line; the second is ignored.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sway uses a ''port'' system for input and output.
When Sway starts up, the current input port defaults to
'''''stdin''''' (the keyboard) and the current output
port defaults to '''''stdout''''' (the screen).

To change these ports, one first creates new port
and then sets the port.
For example, to read from a file (say &quot;data&quot;)
instead of the keyboard,
first create a file port:

    var p = open(&quot;data&quot;,:read);   //p points to a port
    var oldInput = setPort(p);

Once the port is set, all input will come from the new port.

To change the output port, the procedure is similar, except
the symbol &lt;tt&gt;:write&lt;/tt&gt; is used instead.

    var p = open(&quot;data&quot;,:write);   //p points to a port
    var oldOutput = setPort(p);

Opening a file in &lt;tt&gt;:write&lt;/tt&gt; mode overwrites the file;
to append content to an existing file, use the &lt;tt&gt;:append&lt;/tt&gt;
symbol instead.

Sway only allows a limited number of ports to be open at
any given time. If you no longer need a port, close it with
the built-in function ''close'', which takes a port as its
sole argument:

    close(p);

== Reading ==

Sway supplies built-in functions for reading characters,
integers, reals,
strings, and whitespace delimited tokens:

    s = readChar();
    i = readInt();
    r = readReal();
    s = readString();
    t = readToken();

Both the ''readChar'' and the ''readToken'' functions return strings.
Sway uses the same rules as the C programming language
for what characters constitute an integer and a real .
None of these functions take an argument; they use the current
input port.

To read a symbol, use the ''symbol'' function in conjunction
with the ''readToken'' function:

    s = symbol(readToken());

To read a line of text, use the built-in ''readLine'' function:

    l = readLine();
    
The ''readLine'' function reads up to, and including, the next
newline character, but the newline is not part of the
returned string.

The ''pause'' function always reads from '''''stdin''''',
regardless of the current input port.
It reads (and discards) a line of text (up to and including the newline).
Its purpose is to pause execution of a program for debugging
purposes.

== Writing ==

Most output functions write to the current output port.

The simplest output function is ''display''. It takes a single
argument, which can be any Sway object:

    display(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);

The character sequence '\' followed by 'n' indicate that
a newline is to be displayed.

More useful than display are the functions ''print'' and
''println'' in that they take any number of arguments:

    print(&quot;(f(x) is &quot;,f(x),&quot;\n&quot;);
    println(&quot;(f(x) is &quot;,f(x));

The ''println'' function is just like ''print'', except it
outputs a newline after the displaying the last argument.
Thus, the two calls above produce the same output.

When a string is printed, the quote marks are not displayed.
Likewise, when a symbol is printed, the colon is not displayed.

The ''inspect'' function is discussed in more detail in
[[Chapter 10|../ch10]], but, in short, prints out the unevaluated
version of its argument followed by its evaluated argument:

    sway&gt; inspect(f(x));
    f(x) is 3
    INTEGER: 3

The ''inspect'' function always prints to '''''stdout''''',
regardless of the current output port.

== Pretty printing ==

There are three built-in pretty printing functions:
''pp'', ''ppFlat'', and ''ppObject''. They print reasonable
representations of all Sway objects to the current output
port. The difference between ''pp'' and ''ppFlat'' is that ''ppFlat''
coalesces all contiguous white space (including tabs and
newlines) into a single space, thus printing the representation
on a single line.

The ''ppObject'' function is used for printing Sway functions
in object form. Given the function:

    function f(x)
        {
        var y = x + 1;
        y * y;
        }

the ''pp'' function outputs:

    sway&gt; pp(f);
    function f(x)
        {
        var y = x + 1;
        y * y;
        }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function f(x)&gt;

while ''ppObject'' outputs:

    sway&gt; ppObject(f);
    &lt;FUNCTION 2626&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 807&gt;
        prior: :null
        filter: :null
        parameters: (x)
        code: { var y = x + 1; y * y }
        name: f
    FUNCTION: &lt;function f(x)&gt;

== Formatting ==

The ''fmt'' function can be used to format numbers and strings
if the default formatting is not acceptable. It uses the C
programming language formatting scheme, taking a formatting
specification as a string, and the item to be formatted.
The function returns a string.

For example,

    sway&gt;&quot;&lt;&quot; + fmt(&quot;%6d&quot;,3) + &quot;&gt;&quot;;
    STRING: &quot;&lt;     3&gt;&quot;
    
    sway&gt;&quot;&lt;&quot; + fmt(&quot;%-6d&quot;,3) + &quot;&gt;&quot;;
    STRING: &quot;&lt;3     &gt;&quot;

A format specification begins with '%' and usually followed
by a number representing the width (in number of characters)
of the resulting string. If the width is positive, the
item is right justified in the resulting string. If the width
is negative, the item is left justified.
After any width specification is a character specifying the
type of the item to be formatted: 'd' for integer, 'f' for
string, and 's' for string.

The format specification is quite a bit more sophisticated
than shown here. You can read more on a Linux system by
typing the command 'man 3 printf' at the system prompt.

== Testing for end of file ==

The ''eof?'' function can be used to test whether the last
read was successful or not. The function is NOT used to
test if the ''next'' read is successful. Here is a typical
use of ''eof?'' in tokenizing a file:

    t = readToken();
    while (eof?() == :false)
        {
        store(t);
        t = readToken();
        }

== Pushing back a character ==

Sometimes, it is necessary to read one character too
many from the input. This happens in cases like
advancing past whitespace in the input.
Here is a typical whitespace-clearing loop:

    ch = readChar();
    while (space?(ch))
        {
        ch = readChar();
        }

    //last character read wasn't whitespace
    //so push it back to be read again later

    pushBack(ch);

The ''pushBack'' function takes a string as its
sole argument, but only pushes back the first
character of the string; subsequent characters in
the string are ignored.

In the previous chapter, we learned about looping using
the functions ''while'', ''do''-''until'', ''for'', and ''for''-''each''.
These functions implement what is known as ''iterative'' looping.

Recursion is another way of looping; often, recursive
loops are 
easier to write and understand, as compared to iterative loops,
such as ''while''s and ''for''s.
Many mathematical functions are easy to implement recursively, so
we will start there. Recall that the factorial of a number
''n'' is:

    &lt;math&gt; n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 2 * 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Consider writing a function which computes the factorial of a positive
integer. For example, if the function were passed the value of 4, it
should return the value of 24 since 4! is 4*3*2*1 or 24. One approach
would be to use an iterative 
loop to cycle through all the multipliers, saving the
partial product at each iteration.
Getting the code to work correctly does take
a bit of fiddling to get all the important bits right.
A working implementation might look like:

    function factorial(n)
        {
        var i;
        var product = 1;
       
        for (i = 1, i &lt;= n, i = i + 1)
            {
            product = product * i;
            }
        product;
        }

This implementation raises many questions, since it goes
against the general convention for structuring
a counting loop:

* Why was the product initialized to one instead of zero?
* Why was the loop initialization chosen to be &lt;math&gt;i = 1&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;i = 0&lt;/math&gt;?
* Why was the loop test &lt;math&gt;i &lt;= n&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;i &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;?

With some pondering, these questions can be answered because of
the mathematics of multiplication..

There is a radically different approach that can be taken, an extremely
simple, elegant, and powerful approach, called ''recursion''.
To apply
recursion to solve a problem, it must be possible to state the solution
of a problem in ever simpler terms. For factorial, the factorial of a
number can be stated in terms of a simpler factorial.

    &lt;math&gt; 0! = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
    &lt;math&gt; n! = n * (n - 1)! &lt;/math&gt; otherwise

This second formulation states that the factorial of zero is onea.
&lt;ref&gt;
Mathematicians, being an inclusive bunch, like to invite
zero to the factorial party.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and that the factorial of any other (positive) number is obtained by
multiplying the that number by the factorial of one less than that
number. After some study, you should be able to see that both
the first formulation (with the ellipses ...) and this new
formulation are equivalent&lt;ref&gt;
The first formulation gets the basic idea of factorial
across but is not very precise. For example, how would you computer
the factorial of three using the first formulation?
&lt;/ref&gt;.
The second form is particularly well suited for implementation
as a computer program:

      function factorial(n)
          {
          if (n == 0)
              {
              1;
              }
          else
              {
              n * factorial(n - 1);
              }
          }

or
      function factorial(n)
          {
          if (n == 0,1,n * factorial(n - 1));
          }

using ''if'''s pure function call syntax.

Note how these two versions of ''factorial''
precisely implement the second formulation.

Convince yourself that the function really works by tracing the function call:

    factorial(3)

Decomposing the call, we find that:

    factorial(3) is 3 * factorial(2)

since ''n'', having a value of 3, is not equal to 0.
and so the second block of the ''if'' is evaluated.
We can replace &lt;tt&gt;factorial(2)&lt;/tt&gt; by &lt;tt&gt;2 * factorial(1)&lt;/tt&gt;, yielding:

    factorial(3) is 3 * 2 * factorial(1)

since ''n'', now having a value of 2, is still not zero.
Continuing along this vein, we can replace
&lt;tt&gt;factorial(1)&lt;/tt&gt; by &lt;tt&gt;1 * factorial(0)&lt;/tt&gt;, yielding:

    factorial(3) is 3 * 2 * 1 * factorial(0)

Now in this call to factorial,
''n'' does have a value of zero, so we can replace
&lt;tt&gt;factorial(0)&lt;/tt&gt; with its immediate return value of zero:

    factorial(3) is 3 * 2 * 1 * 1

Thus, &lt;tt&gt;factorial(3)&lt;/tt&gt; has a value of six:

    sway&gt; factorial(3);
    INTEGER: 6

as expected.

== The parts of a recursive function ==

Recursive approaches rely on the fact that it is
usually simpler to solve a smaller problem than a
larger one. In the factorial problem, trying to
find the factorial ''n'' - 1 is a little bit simpler
than finding the factorial of ''n''. If finding the
factorial of ''n - 1'' is still too hard to solve easily,
then find the factorial of ''n - 2'' and so on until
we find a case where the solution is easy.
With regards to factorial, this is when ''n'' is equal to
zero. The 'easy-to-solve' code (and the values that gets
you there) is known as the ''base'' case. The
find-the-solution-for-a-simpler-problem code (and the values
that get you there) is known as the ''recursive'' case.
The recursive case usually contains a call to the very
function being executed. This call is known as a
''recursive'' call.

Most well-formed recursive functions are composed of
at least one ''base'' case and at least one ''recursive'' case.

== The greatest common divisor ==

Consider finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers. One
approach is use repeated division. The first division divides the two
numbers in question, saving the remainder. Now make the divisor
the dividend and the remainder the divisor. Repeat this
process until the remainder is zero.
At that
point, the current divisor is the gcd.

Let's turn it into a function,
first iteratively and then recursively.

    // compute the gcd of two positive integers iteratively
    
    function gcd(first,second)
        {
        var remainder;
    
        do-until (remainder == 0)
            {
            remainder = first % second;
            first = second;
            second = remainder;
            }
    
        first;  //first holds the last divisor
        }

The ''do-until'' loop insures that the loop body is 
executed before the remainder is tested.
Let's rewrite the function recursively. First we identify the recurrence
case(s) and then the base case(s). In this case, the recurrence and
base cases are a little different than in the factorial example. We
recur&lt;ref&gt;
The word is ''recur'', NOT ''recurse''!
&lt;/ref&gt;if the remainder is not zero. We immediately return the answer if
the remainder is zero. Now that the recurrence and base cases have been
identified, we can write the recursive version without too much trouble.

    // compute the gcd of two positive integers
    
    function gcd(first,second)
        {
        if (first % second == 0)
            {
            second;
            }
        else
            {
            gcd(second,first % second);
            }
        }

or

    function gcd(first,second)
        {
        if (first % second == 0,second,gcd(second,first % second));
        }

or, to remove the repeated computation of the remainder:

    function gcd(first,second)
        {
        var remainder = first % second;
        if (remainder == 0,second,gcd(second,remainder));
        }

Again, the recursive version is more compact.

Look at how the recursive version turns ''second'' into ''first''
by passing ''second'' as the first argument in the recursive
call.
By the same token, ''remainder'' becomes ''second'' by nature
of being the second argument in the recurive call.
To convince yourself that the routine really works,
modify ''gcd'' to inspect the arguments:

    function gcd(first,second)
        {
        var remainder = first % second;
        inspect(array(first,second,remainder));
        if (remainder == 0,second,gcd(second,remainder));
        }

You haven't learned about arrays or the built-in ''array''
function yet, but think of it as a way to group multiple things
together. Inspecting the array is a trick to get multiple
values inspected with a single call to ''inspect''.

    sway&gt; gcd(66,42);
    array(first,second,remainder) is [66,42,24]
    array(first,second,remainder) is [42,24,18]
    array(first,second,remainder) is [24,18,6]
    array(first,second,remainder) is [18,6,0]
    INTEGER: 6

Note, how the first remainder, 24, keeps shifting
to the left.
In the first recursive call, the remainder becomes 
''second'', so the 24 shifts one spot to the left. On
the second recursive call, the current ''second'',
which is 24,
becomes ''first'',
so the 24 shifts once again to
the left.

==The Fibonacci sequence==

A third example of recursion is the computation of the
&lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; Fibonacci number.
The Fibonacci series looks like this:
 
    n       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8    ...
    Fib(n)  0   1   1   2   3   5   8  13  21    ...

and is found in nature again and again&lt;ref&gt;
Pineapples, the golden ratio, chambered nautilus, etc.
&lt;/ref&gt;..
In general, a Fibonacci number is equal to the sum of the previous
two Fibonacci numbers. The exceptions are the zeroes and the first
Fibonacci numbers which are equal to 0 and 1 respectively. Voila! The
recurrence case and the two base cases have jumped right out at us! Here,
then is a recursive implementation of a function which computes the nth
Fibonacci number.
 
    // compute the nth Fibonacci number
    // n must be non-negative!
    
    function fibonacci(n)
        {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
        }

Our implementation is straightforward and elegant. Unfortunately, it's
horribly inefficient. Unlike our recursive versions of
''factorial'' and ''gcd'',
which recurred about as many times as the iterative versions looped,
our Fibonacci version will recur many, many more times than an iterative
version of Fibonacci when computing larger Fibonacci numbers. Here's why.

Consider the call to &lt;tt&gt;fib(6)&lt;/tt&gt;.
Tracing all the recursive calls to ''fib'', we get:

    fib(6) is fib(5) + fib(4)

Replacing &lt;tt&gt;fib(5)&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;fib(4) + fib(3)&lt;/tt&gt;,
we get:

    fib(6) is fib(4) + fib(3) + fib(4)

We can already see a problem, we will compute fib(4) twice,
once from the original call to fib(6) and again when we
try to find fib(5).
If we write down all the recursive calls to &lt;tt&gt;fib(6)&lt;/tt&gt;
which each recursive call indented from the previous, we
get a structure that looks like this:

    fib(6)
        fib(5)
            fib(4)
                fib(3)
                    fib(2)
                        fib(1)
                        fib(0)
                    fib(1)
                fib(2)
                    fib(1)
                    fib(0)
            fib(3)
                fib(2)
                    fib(1)
                    fib(0)
                fib(1)
        fib(4)
            fib(3)
                fib(2)
                    fib(1)
                    fib(0)
                fib(1)
            fib(2)
                fib(1)
                fib(0)

We would expect, based on how the Fibonacci sequence is
generated to take about six 'steps' to calculate &lt;tt&gt;fib(6)&lt;/tt&gt;. 
Instead,
ultimately there were 13 calls to either
&lt;tt&gt;fib(1)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;fib(0)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
13 is a Fibonacci number. Curious!
&lt;/ref&gt;.
There was a tremendous amount of duplicated,
and therefore wasted effort. So let's try to compute
Fibonacci numbers using an iterative loop:
      
      function fib(n)
          {
          var i;
          var first = 0;
          var second = 1;
   
          for (i = 0, i &lt; n, i = i + 1)
              {
              var sum = first + second;
              first = second;
              second = sum;
              }
   
           first;
           }

In the loop body, we see that ''fib'' is much like ''gcd'';
the second number becomes the first number and some combination of
the first and second number becomes the second number.
In the case of ''gcd'', the combination was the remainder and, in the
case of ''fib'', the combination is sum.

As with factorial, hitting on the right way to proceed iteratively
is not exactly straightforward, while the recursive version
practically wrote itself.
Noting the similarity of ''fib'' and ''gcd'' suggest a way to
have both recursion and efficiency at the same time.

==More on recursive loops==

To transform an iterative loop into a
recursive loop, one first identifies those variables
that are changing in the loop body;
these variable will become formal parameters in the recursive
function.
For example, the ''fib'' loop above has three (not two!)
variables that
are being changed during each iteration of the loop:
''first'', ''second'', and ''i''. So, we start out
our recursive function as thus:

    function loop(first,second,i)
        {
        ...
        }

The loop test becomes an ''if'' test in the body of
the ''loop'' function:

    function loop(first,second,i)
        {
        if (i &lt; n)
            {
            ...
            }
        else
            {
            ...
            }
        }

The if-true block becomes the recursive call.
The arguments to the recursive call encode the updates
to the loop variables 
The if-false block becomes the value the loop attempted to
calculate:

    function loop(first,second,i)
        {
        if (i &lt; n)
            {
            loop(second,first + second,i + 1);
            }
        else
            {
            first;
            }
        }

Using function call syntax for ''if'' shortens up the function:

    function loop(first,second,i)
        {
        if (i &lt; n,loop(second,first + second,i + 1),first);
        }

Next, we embed the ''loop'' function into our the function
containing the original loop. That way, any non-local variables
referenced in the test or body of the original loop will
be visible to the ''loop'' function:

    function fib(n)
        {
        function loop(first,second,i)
            {
            if (i &lt; n,loop(second,first + second,i + 1),first);
            }
        ...
        }

Finally, we call the ''loop'' function with the initial
values of the loop variables:

    function fib(n)
        {
        function loop(first,second,i)
            {
            if (i &lt; n,loop(second,first + second,i + 1),first);
            }
        loop(0,1,0);
        }

For more practice, let's convert the iterative version of
''factorial'' into a recursive function using this method.
We'll see we'll end up with a different recursive function
than before.

    function factorial(n)
        {
        var i;
        var product = 1;
   
        for (i = 1, i &lt;= n, i = i + 1)
            {
            product = product * i;
            }
        product;
        }

We start, as before, by working on the ''loop'' function.
In this case,
only two variables are changing in the loop:
product and ''i''.

    function loop(product,i)
        {
        ...
        }

Next, we write the ''if'' expression:

    function loop(product,i)
        {
        if (i &lt;= n,loop(product * i,i + 1),product);
        }

Next, we embed the ''loop'' function and call it:

    function factorial(n)
        {
        function loop(product,i)
            {
            if (i &lt;= n,loop(product * i,i + 1),product);
            }
        loop(1,1);
        }

    
The moral of this story is that any iterative loop can be rewritten
as a recursion and any recursion can be rewritten as
an iterative loop. Moreover, in 'good' languages&lt;ref&gt;
Someday, Sway will be a 'good' language.
&lt;/ref&gt;,
there is no reason to prefer one way over the other,
either in terms of the time it takes or the space used
in execution. Use a recursion if that makes the implementation
more clear, otherwise, use an iterative loop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are three main ''data structures'' built into Sway:
''arrays'', ''lists'', and ''objects''.
A data
structure is simply a collection of
bits of information
&lt;ref&gt;
Bits in the informal sense, not zeros and ones.
&lt;/ref&gt;
that are
somehow glued together into a single whole. Each of these bits
can be be accessed individually. Usually, the bits are somehow
related, as well, so the data structure is a convenient way
to keep all these related bits nicely packaged together.

== Arrays ==

An array is a data structure with the property that each
bit of information can be accessed just as quickly as the
others. To create an array, one uses the ''array'' function:

    var a = array(42,64.0,&quot;hello&quot;,:world);

This call creates an array that packages together four items or
elements. The variable ''a'' is created and set to point at
the package.

To access individual elements, one uses the 'square bracket'
notation or the 'dot' notation. For example, here's how to access the
first item in an array:

    sway&gt; a[0];
    INTEGER: 42
     
    sway&gt; a . 0
    INTEGER: 42

Note that array indexing (the number between the brackets or after
the dot is known as an ''index'') is zero-based. That is, the first
element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. Usually,
the 'dot notation' is not used for arrays, because of the high
precedence of 'dot'. For example:

    a[row * cols + col]

is not the same as:

    a . row * cols + col

as in the later, the element at the ''row'' index is retrieved and then
multiplied by ''cols'' and then that number is added to ''col''.
To make the latter the same as the former, one would parenthesize the
index calculation:

    a . (row * cols + col)

With bracket notation, the parenthesization is performed
automatically.

One can assign to arrays as well:

    sway&gt; a[0] = :forty-two;
    SYMBOL: :forty-two
     
    sway&gt; a[0];
    SYMBOL: :forty-two

One can also look at the tail end of an array. The tail end of
an array is the array without the first, or head, element.

    sway&gt; tail(a);
    ARRAY: [64.000000000,&quot;hello&quot;,:world]
     
    sway&gt; tail(a)[0];
    REAL_NUMBER: 64.000000000

If you keep taking the tail of an array,
eventually you end up with &lt;tt&gt;:null&lt;/tt&gt;:

    sway&gt;tail(tail(tail(tail(a))));
    SYMBOL: :null;

=== Allocating empty arrays ===

It is possible to allocate an array without specifying the actual
elements:

    var b = alloc(10);

This creates an array of ten elements (with indices ranging from
zero to nine).

    sway&gt; b[0];
    SYMBOL: :null;

Each of the elements is initialized to :null.

== Lists ==

A list is a data structure that has the property that
it can be lengthened and shortened by adding or removing
elements anywhere in the list. The trade-off for this
flexibility is that elements further down in the list
take longer to access than those elements earlier in
the list. Creating and accessing elements in a list is
very similar to arrays:

    var a = list(42,64.0,&quot;hello&quot;,:world);
     
    sway&gt; a[2];
    STRING: &quot;hello&quot;
    
    sway&gt; a[3] = 13;
    INTEGER: 13

To make a list longer, one can easily add an element to
the front of an existing list to make a new list:

    var b = &quot;apple&quot; join a;
    LIST: (&quot;apple&quot;,42,64.000000000,&quot;hello&quot;,:world)

=== Lists can share elements ===

It is very important to note that both ''a'' and ''b'' above share elements
and changes to ''a'' will affect ''b'':

    sway&gt; a[1] = :pie;
    SYMBOL: :pie
     
    sway&gt; a;
    LIST: (42,:pie,&quot;hello&quot;,:world);
     
    sway&gt; b;
    LIST: (&quot;apple&quot;,42,:pie,&quot;hello&quot;,:world);

Making ''b'' independent of ''a'' is a task that seems easier than
it actually is. Here is a function that makes the attempt:

    function join*(item,items)
        {
        function copy(stuff)
            {
            if (stuff == :null,:null,stuff[0] join copy(tail(stuff)));
            }
        item join copy(items);
        }

This works in some cases:

    var x = list(:apples,:pears,:bananas);
    var y = :kumquats join* x;               //note join*, not join
    
    x[1] = :persimmons;

    sway&gt; x;
    LIST: (:apples,:persimmons,:bananas);
     
    sway&gt; y;
    LIST: (:kumquats,:apples,:pears,:bananas);

The problems is that the copy made by ''join*'' is a ''shallow''
copy. That is, the incoming list was copied, but the elements
were not. In the case of a list of symbols, the elements do
not need to be copied, but that is not always the case:

    var m = list(2,3,4);
     
    sway&gt; var p = list(1,m,5);
    LIST: (1,(2,3,4),5)

    sway&gt; var q = 0 join* p;       // note, join*, not join
    LIST: (0,1,(2,3,4),5)

Got it so far? Not only does ''q'' share the elements of 
''p'', they both share elements of ''m''. Consider this move:

    p[1][1] = 333; 

where we change the first element of the first element of ''p'':

    sway&gt; p;
    LIST: (1,(2,333,4),5)
     
    sway&gt; q;
    LIST: (0,1,(2,333,4),5)

A change made through ''p'' has still changed ''q''. To solve this
problem, one needs to make a ''deep'' copy, where the elements
of the list are copied and the elements of the elements are
copied, and so on.

=== Changing the tail of a list ===

One can use the ''tail='' function to change the tail of
a list:

    var a = list(1,2,3);
     
    a tail= list(222,333);

    sway&gt; a;
    LIST: (1,222,333);

You can use ''tail='' on any kind of list, even those produced by
''tail'':

    var b = list(1,2,3);
     
    tail(b) tail= list(333);

    sway&gt; b;
    LIST: (1,2,333);

=== Inserting into the middle of a list ===

One uses a combination of join, tail, and tail= to insert into
the middle of a list. Here's how to insert an item after the
first element:

    var c = list(1,3,4);

    c tail= (3 join tail(c));

    sway&gt; c;
    LIST: (1,2,3,4);

The parentheses are needed to insure that the tail of ''c'' is
not set to the number 3 and the result joined with the tail of ''c''.

This method of insertion changes the original list. It is
also possible to make a new list with the inserted element
by writing an insertion function:

    function insert(item,items,index)
        {
        if (index == 0)
            {
            item join items; //put the item at the head of the list
            }
        else
            {
            items[0] join insert(item,tail(items),index - 1);
            }
        }

    var d = list(1,3,4);
    var e = insert(2,d,1); //insert at the second element

    sway&gt; d;
    LIST: (1,3,4);

    sway&gt; e;
    LIST: (1,2,3,4);

Note that insert does a combination of a shallow copy of the
elements preceding the inserted element and creates a sharing
of the elements after the inserted element.

Objects are discussed in the next chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Battle of Trenton==
Prior to Christmas, moral of the Continental Army was at an all time low. Most soldiers contracts would be up by the end of the year, and it seemed that the Revolution was lost. Washington knew he needed a quick victory in order to inspire new recruits and get old ones to stay. He decided that they would attack the British at Trenton.

===The American Plan===
The American plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three different directions. General John Cadwalder would launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown, in order to block off any reinforcements. General James Ewing would take 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over the Assunpink Creek and prevent any enemy troops from escaping. The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, in order to launch a pre-dawn attack. Depending on the success of the operation, the Americans might possibly follow up with separate attacks on Princeton and New Brunswick.

During the week prior to Christmas, American advance parties had begun to ambush enemy cavalry patrols, capturing dispatch riders, and attacking Hessian pickets. This became so effective, that the Hessian commander had to send 100 infantry and an artillery detachment to protect his letter to the British commander at Princeton.

===Hessian Moves===
Trenton had two main streets, King (now Warren) Street and Queen (now Broad) Street. Rall had been ordered to build a redoubt at the head of these two streets (where the battle monument stands today) by his superior, Count Carl von Donop, whose own brigade was stationed in Bordentown. Donop himself had marched south to Mount Holly on December 22 to deal with the South Jersey Rising, and clashed with the New Jersey militia there on December 23.

Rall was a 36-year professional soldier with a great deal of battle experience who had requested reinforcements and been turned down by British commander General James Grant. Grant regarded the Americans with great disdain and sent no reinforcements. Rall's subordinates were convinced that the Americans were going to attack, but Rall himself was not worried, he believed that one bayonet charge would send the Americans fleeing with panic, as bayonet charges had done before.

===The Crossing===
[[Image:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|thumb|300px|Washington crosing the Delaware]]Before Washington and his troops left, Benjamin Rush had come in an attempt to cheer up the General. While he was there he saw a note Washington had written which said &quot;Victory or Death&quot;. Those words would be the watchword for the surprise attack. The terrible weather conditions delayed the landing in New Jersey, which were supposed to be completed by 12:00 am until 3:00 am, and Washington realized it would be impossible to launch a pre-dawn attack. Another setback also occurred for the Americans. Both General Cadwalder and Ewing were unable to join in the attack due to the weather conditions.

For the next four and a half hours, the American troops marched to Trenton. It was a miserable trip. Many did not have boots, so they were forced to wear rags around their feet. Many men's feet bled, turning the snow to a dark red. Two men even laid down in the snow, only never to get back up.

===The Battle===
A small guard post was set up by the Hessians in Pennington about nine miles (14&amp;nbsp;km) north of Trenton, east of Washington's route to the city. When the squad guarding this post saw the large American force on the march, Lieutenant von Wiederholdt, in command of this Pennington picket, made an organized retreat. Once in Trenton the picket began to receive support from other Hessian guard companies on the outskirts of the town. Another guard company nearer to the Delaware River rushed east to their aid, leaving open the River Road into Trenton. General John Sullivan, leading the southern American column entered Trenton by this route and made hard for the only crossing over the Assunpink Creek, which was the only way out of Trenton to the south, in hopes of cutting off the Hessian escape.
[[Image:Henry-revolutionary-war.jpg|thumb|300px|Washington leading the attack on Trenton]]
When the 35 Hessian Jägers under the command of Lieutenant Grothausen who were stationed at the barracks on the northern edge of the town saw the vanguard of Sullivan's forces charging into Trenton, they ran over the Assunpink bridge and left Trenton. Slowly, various companies of the three defending regiments formed and entered the battle. Lieutenant Biel, Rall's brigade adjutant, finally awoke his commander, who found that the rebels had taken the &quot;V&quot; of the major streets of the town where earlier that month Pauli would have constructed the redoubt. The northern American column quickly took this position. The Americans stationed two cannon on a rise that guarded the two main routes out of the town. The Hessians tried to bring four guns into action, but American fire kept them silent, and denied the Hessians a chance to form in the streets. The remaining men in the column, along with the other American column near the river, moved to surround the Hessians.

The Knyphausen regiment of Hessians was separated from the other two regiments and driven back through the southern end of Trenton by John Sullivan's column. The other two Hessian regiments, Lossberg and Rall, retreated into an open field and attempted a counterattack that was quickly driven back. Rall ordered his force to retreat southeast into an apple orchard just outside Trenton. The Hessians in the orchard attempted to reorganize, and make one last attempt to retake the town so they could escape to Princeton.

The Americans, by this time, occupied the majority of the buildings and, from cover, fired into the ranks of the Rall regiment as the Hessians advanced. As the Hessians fought back into the streets of Trenton, they came under fire from cannons, and even some civilians who had joined the battle. Their formations were broken up by cannon fire. At this point, Rall was mortally wounded. The Hessians then retreated back to the Orchard, where they were then surrounded and forced to surrender.

The remains of the Knyphausen Regiment were attempting to escape to Bordentown, but they were slowed when they tried to haul their cannon through boggy ground. They were cut off from the bridge, surrounded by Sullivan's men, and forced to surrender. The regiment surrendered just minutes before the rest of the brigade.

===Casualties and Effects===
The American forces had suffered only a handful of wounded, although two men died of hypothermia on the march and more the next night, while the Hessians suffered 115 casualties with at least 25 dead, as well as 920 captured. The captured Hessians were sent to Philadelphia, and later Lancaster only to be moved once again in 1777, this time to Virginia. [[Image:Trenton Surrender.jpg|thumb|300px|The surrender of the Hessians at Trenton.]]Rall was mortally wounded and died later that day at his headquarters. All four Hessian colonels in Trenton were killed in the battle. The Lossberg regiment was effectively removed from the British forces. Parts of the Knyphausen regiment escaped to the south, but Sullivan captured some 200 men along with the regiment's cannons and supplies. Also captured were about 1,000 arms and some much-needed ammunition.

Only four Americans were wounded, two during the rush to capture Hessian artillery before they could be used in the battle. These wounded were officers: Captain William Washington (the general's cousin), who was badly wounded in both hands, and young Lieutenant James Monroe, the future President of the United States. Monroe was carried from the field bleeding badly after he was struck in the left shoulder by a musket ball, which severed an artery. Doctor John Riker clamped the artery, keeping him from bleeding to death.

==Battle of the Assunpink Creek==
Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis had left 1,400 British troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton, New Jersey. Following the surprise victory at the Battle of Trenton early in the morning of December 26, 1776, General George Washington of the Continental Army and his council of war expected a strong British counter-attack. Washington and his council decided to meet this attack in Trenton.

===The Battle===
On December 30, he crossed the Delaware River back into New Jersey and, over the next few days, massed his troops on higher ground south of Trenton, across a stream running through downtown called Assunpink Creek. On January 2, 1777, the day-long march ended when the larger British army led by General Cornwallis encountered Washington's own army. The Americans slowly withdrew, splitting into smaller units in order to harrass the British. The small groups of American soldiers had succeeded in slowing Cornwallis' march from Princeton to Trenton, and inflicting heavy casualties, but the British force arrived en masse in the late afternoon.

The armies were facing each other from 200 yards (200 m) apart with only the creek and the bridge in between. Cornwallis ordered the assault. Cannon and rifle fire erupted from Washington's side leaving heavy British casualties after fierce fighting. Two more attempts were made by the British to take the bridge, but each time they were repulsed. The bridge held, darkness fell, and Cornwallis withdrew. Hundreds of British soldiers were recovered from the bridge ending the battle. Cornwallis commented &quot;Rest for now. We'll bag the fox in the morning.&quot;

===Escape===
That night, Washington's army built up their campfires before silently slipping away after midnight while an unsuspecting Cornwallis slept. Cornwallis had failed to post adequate scouts to detect movements by Washington's army. Washington and his staff decided to sneak away in the night, marching around the British forces and attacking their rear in Princeton. The Americans left a token force to build fortifications as though they were planning to defend at the creek and to disguise the sound of their march. British forces perceived the movement, but Cornwallis believed this to be Americans planning a night attack and ordered British troops into defensive positions, allowing Americans to successfully march their army around Cornwallis

==Battle of Princeton==
Throughout the night, the army marched over a back road toward Princeton and reached the Quaker Bridge over Stony Brook, about a mile south of town. The Quaker Bridge was not strong enough to support the army’s cannon and ammunition carts, so another bridge had to be built quickly. While the bridge was being constructed, Washington reformed his army, and then split it into two parts—the smaller left wing under General Nathanael Greene and the larger right wing under General John Sullivan. Washington had intended to attack Princeton before dawn, but the sun was rising.

Greene’s assignment was to advance to the Princeton-Trenton highway to stop its traffic and destroy its bridge over Stony Brook. Sullivan’s division, the main attack force, moved toward the rear of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). The British were known to have outposts on the roads to the north, east and west, but an abandoned road went into town from the west, which Sullivan took.

Before Greene’s wing (with 3,400 men) reached the highway, the leading brigade, 1,200 men under General Hugh Mercer of Virginia, encountered 800 men who were elements of the British 4th Brigade, accompanied by 2 light guns, under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood. The British group was marching from Princeton to Trenton to reinforce General Leslie's 2nd Brigade. The last unit of the 4th Brigade was left to hold Princeton with another 400 men.

===The Battle===
Upon seeing the American force, Mawhood formed up his men across the edge of an orchard which Mercer's troops were passing through. A violent firefight developed, and Mawhood launched an assault which largely cleared the orchard of Mercer's troops, who began to retreat in confusion. General Mercer was wounded but refused to surrender. When he tried to attack the enemy with his sword, he was bayoneted until presumed dead; he died nine days later. Colonel John Haslet of Delaware replaced General Mercer and was killed by a shot to the head.

During this confusion, General Washington rode up to rally Mercer's men, while a fresh brigade of 2,100 troops under General John Cadwalader arrived with an artillery battery. Washington then rode straight into the British fire, personally leading the attack. As Washington charged towards the British lines, he was heard yelling &quot;Parade with me my brave fellows, we will have them soon!&quot;

With these reinforcements, and Washington having successfully rallied Mercer's men, the larger American force was able, by pressure of numbers, to retake most of the orchard, until fire from Mawhood's guns halted the American advance.
[[Image:GeorgeWashington BattleofPrinceton.jpg|thumb|300px|Washington rallying the troops at Princeton]]
A second British assault cleared the orchard, and seemed about to win the day until Sullivan led up another 1,300 troops. Now outnumbered nearly 6 to 1, Mawhood led a final charge to break through American lines. A number of the British soldiers broke through the Americans in a desperate bayonet charge, continuing down the road to Trenton. Washington led some of his force in pursuit of Mawhood, but they abandoned this and turned back when some of Leslie's troops came into sight. The remainder of the British fell back into Princeton, which, along with the men already there, they defended against Sullivan's force for a while, before retreating to New Brunswick. A number of troops were left behind in Princeton. Facing overwhelming numbers and artillery fire, they surrendered. The British casualty list stated 86 killed and wounded and 200 captured. The Americans suffered 40 killed and wounded.

In Trenton, Cornwallis and his men awoke to the sounds of cannon fire coming from behind their position. Cornwallis and his army began to race to Princeton. However, Washington's rear guard had managed to damage the bridge over the Stony Brook, and American snipers further delayed Cornwallis' Army. The exhausted American Army slipped away, marching to Somerset County Courthouse (now Millstone), where they spent the night. When the main British force finally reached Princeton late in the day, they did not remain but continued in haste toward New Brunswick, New Jersey.

===Aftermath===
After the battle, Cornwallis abandoned many of his posts in New Jersey, and ordered his army to retreat to New Brunswick. The battle at Princeton cost the British some 100 men killed, 70 wounded 280 captured and greatly boosted the morale of the Continental troops, leading 8,000 new recruits to join the Continental Army.

American historians often consider it a great victory on par with the battle of Trenton, due to the subsequent loss of control of most of New Jersey by the Crown forces as well as the important political implications of the battle across the Atlantic in France and Spain, both of which would expand their military aid to the Continental forces after the battle. Fredrick the Great is to have pronounced Washington's achievements in those few weeks, the most brilliant in military history.

== Introduction to Approach ==


We are following a development framework that incorporates agile development approaches in a structured framework.  (see [http://agilemanifesto.org/ manifesto], [http://www.sdmagazine.com/ manifesto description], [http://www.agilemodeling.com/ more]).   Agility implies

-	individuals and iterations over processes and tasks

-	working software over comprehensive documentation 

-	customer collaboration over contract negotiation

-	responding to change over following a plan.

The focus of the project is on the production of robust working systems (software, hardware and maintenance documentation).  Planning, comprehensive development documentation and processes are important but are 'means to an end' with a focus on content rather than format/representation.  It is expected that you discard most of the models you develop (although you do have to keep them for assessment!).

We aim, then for the middle ground between Bureaucracy and Adhocracy.

[[Image:Risk_management.gif]]

At any one point you should expect to have five interacting streams of work underway.  At different times, different streams are more important. 
[[Image:Spiral_arrows.gif‎]]
[[Image:Spiral_arrows_wiggly.png‎ ]]

The varying proportions of each stream coalesce into &quot;sectors&quot; defined by a deliverable output, steering and communication with the client.

[[Image:Spiral_sectors2.png|400px]]

The sectors here can be seen to resemble a structured development process. 

[[Image:3circles.jpg]]
We are going through three iterations.  The first iteration is aimed at building understanding within the development group and client.   The second iteration is aimed at designing and releasing (to the client) a system that meets many of the functional requirements.  The third iteration, &quot;robust delivery&quot; is intended to review the success of the second iteration in meeting business requirements, to review functional requirements (there will probably be more), and to deliver a robust and stylish &quot;bullet proof&quot; implementation.  

At any time, you will be working in a sectors made up of the 5 work streams, being one of three iterations and having a focus on a particular area.
[[Image:Sector-explode.gif]]
[[Image:Spiral_section_background.png]]
Each sector is defined by what it produces.  We provide you with a suite of tools that may be used within each sector, but so long as you can provide evidence of a rational process (see evidence portfolio below), we are less concerned with the internals of the sector.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Iteration overview.==

Having gone through nearly two years of doing assignments with specific instructions, the students arrive second year classes in software engineering expecting to be given a detailed brief. When they don't get one from us, they turn to the client, hoping to find one there.  Usually they don't get one there either.

[[Image:I1_clientinterview.jpg |align=&quot;left&quot;]]

In 2008 our software engineering class is working to develop the &quot;Living Campus Information Infrastructure&quot; . What does that mean? Good question, and one the students have been asking both us and their client, Paula.

In this project we are not being deliberately vague, we genuinely don't know where this project is heading. This makes teaching the course interesting, in adopting the agile concept of embracing change we are also experiencing the values of courage, simplicity, feedback and respect. This applies to the students and the academics equally, which makes for a shared learning experience.

We're also following the manifesto, valuing those things on the left more than those on the right:

* individuals and iterations over processes and tasks

* working software over comprehensive documentation

* customer collaboration over contract negotiation

* responding to change over following a plan.

We mix this agile approach with a framework - three iterations. Each has milestone deliverables, the first is understanding and communication, the second a functional delivery, and the third: a robust delivery.

So the goals of the first iteration are all about building understandings - not what the project is going to result in, nor even what it has to do. Rather, the focus is on why - why is this a project that needs their help. In other words - what is the business opportunity.

The first iteration is also about building confidence and communication (within the group and with stakeholders).

In the first iteration the goals are to build up understanding of the business opportunity, and how the teams might use their skills in information technology to work towards meeting that opportunity.

One of the first things they do is to meet with the client. The purpose of this meeting is to establish connections with the client.  It is not the time to be expecting detailed functional requirements.  

By the end of the first iteration we will have:

* established a development team

* established firm communication links with the client

* established that we are on common ground with the client about the high level need for the project

* established a methodology and work practices.

The first iteration is quick. For a full year capstone project, this should take a maximum of two weeks.  Two weeks, that's hardly long enough!  Yes it is. On each of the tasks described in each chapter, an information box indicates how long each task should take.  If it's taking longer than this, then you're doing something wrong.

Use of product: the extent to which interacted with by live user within expected lifespan of product; both frequency and intensity of interaction are considered. 

Value of process:  the extent to which being involved in the process generates follow-on business value (to both client and institution).  

Quality of work: quality of produced product or process. 



Working Product – installation plan and user manual should be on user plan and due dates, installation must be working and ready
Testing: being rigorous about your testing, getting other people to use with without your intervention test cases, automated testing, a good thing to do.  Always have a working product, always have something that is somebody said, “I want the delivery tomorrow thanks” “we have 4 of the functional requirement” “I say scrap it, you have something working” “what wed rather have is working, working, working , not done”
Do the nightly build? Don’t bite of more than you can chew in a day, be careful with versions, also aware of continuous integration
Use pair programming, 2 people with one keyboard is more productive than 2 separate keyboards
Be aware of release planning – you should have on a piece of paper, or whiteboard, what the dates are and what you are delivering on those dates. Get them using the system as soon as possible
And lastly, if your not already, use a whiteboard, make all this stuff, they key thing here, make all this stuff visible what they talk about in the book is key metrics, make them visible, write up your functional requirements and a tick them off on a date when they are done or expected to be done, and put them up on the whiteboard

Abstract
This paper proposes a value proposition (or earned value) model for considering computing capstone projects with real clients. The value of student industry projects are considered in terms of value of product, benefit of process, and in terms of quality of work.  This model is developed from discussion of an assessed value of example projects. Characteristics of projects in different value categories are explored and potential uses of the model discussed. 
Keywords:  capstone projects, computer education, value proposition

1	Introduction
Many computing degrees include a capstone project (Fincher and Petre 2001).  Chamillard and Braun (2002) argued that “the most critical aspect of the (software engineering/capstone) sequence is the use of real projects, with real customers” (p227). 
The value of these projects is of interest for several reasons.  In the initiation of capstone projects the project size and scope may be specified in course documents in terms of a nominal hypothetical value for the required project size and complexity.  At the end of a project, the value may have a role in assessment (eg Mann and Smith 2005 describe a 80% weighting on deployment and implementation with a threshold for assessment of attaining “client satisfaction”). 
The value of a project can also be seen to have importance in development.  Cockton (2004) describes value propositions as driver in human computer interaction.  On a larger scale, Boehm (2003) describes the role of value in project monitoring and control.
A single project may be examined in terms of its potential value, especially with expectations for innovation, and be seen as having potential for developing as business, perhaps in an institution supported incubator (Tidd et al.2001).  At an institutional level there is interest in valuing any contribution to industry and community, especially where the claim is for the value of applied research (ie in Pasteur’s quadrant, Stokes’ 1997). 
The capstone literature is full of claims for the value of individual projects (eg Garrett et al. 2003), for the value of courses Bruhn and Camp’s (2004) “win-win-win” situation for all:
1. The students gain real professional skills;
2. The industry receives useful products; and
3. The faculty successfully engages students in meaningful education that prepares them for transitions from academic theory to industrial practice.”
Bruhn and Camp give an example of “one heathcare corporate sponsor reports that one team saved them over $100,000 in consulting services, plus a projected savings of thousands annually in overhead and operational costs”.  But beyond such anecdotes of individual projects there is little in the literature regarding the economic value of capstone projects.
We argue that the value to the industry is more complex than just this “receives useful products”.  We first examine client satisfaction as a means of valuing projects and then attempt to give a monetary value to projects.  We then propose an earned value model of considering projects and finally, consider the implications of such a model. 
2	Client satisfaction
The value to the client is usually expressed as client satisfaction which could be used to calculate a monetary value.  Each client may be asked to provide a letter expressing their satisfaction with the project (Figure 1).  These letters are a source of pride for the students and many institutions but they are difficult to use for ascribing value of the project to the business. 
The most obvious flaw is the  dual role of these letters – their primary role is a tool in assessment – after working with students for a year, unless the interaction has gone very badly, most clients will try to say positive things (the school report phenomena).  A further difficulty is inconsistency of language. 
Nevertheless, clearly there would be many projects where a positive client response lines up with what we would consider to be a good project.  Similarly, a bad project will often elicit a tempered response.  Most capstone supervisors will also recognise mismatches of client response and quality of project (“Great project – fail”, or “Terrible project – pass”).  
3	Value proposition
In accounting, the client satisfaction would be considered in terms of “prepared to pay” Copeland et al. (2000).   
In this section we examine this “prepared to pay” using the capstone projects described by (Mann and Smith 2004, 2005) as examples.  These projects range from websites to complex applications and embedded systems (see full descriptions in Mann and Smith 2004, 2005).
A project to develop a remote water monitoring buoy (Richards et al. 2005) has resulted in a business now preparing to sell monitoring buoys for $70,000 each.  This business can be clearly valued at several hundred thousand dollars.  This is despite not having any significant intellectual property.
Potential is also found in projects undertaken for large organisations.  In 2005, a project for a major meat company investigated RFID by adding the chips to the labelling system: After this exercise the company is now 
embarking on a multi-million initiative to convert the production lines to RFID capable.  Although the product of this work was RFID in a very small part of the production system, the company found this very valuable “this project has enabled us to obtain a very good understanding of RFID and the knowledge gained will be of much value to us”.  A consultant to spend several months working with a company as it explored new technology in this way would cost at least $50,000.  Similar examples include the proof of concept of a content management system for an accountancy firm and proving the potential of mobile access to corporate data for a large institution. 
Some projects result in a tool that the client can directly make money from.  An electrical engineering company servicing dairy farms had a need to measure power quality in rural areas.  A project team developed a recording voltmeter suitable for use in agri-industrial environments and a software application.  This unit is now being hired out at a cost of $200 per day.  The engineers could have purchased a system for around $7000 but they are now in a position to manufacture the devices themselves, this. being new business for our client.  
Many capstone projects are designed to act in support of the business infrastructure.  Such infrastructure projects are more difficult to ascribe a value (how much are the checkouts worth to a supermarket?).  

{{Adfexemplar | Workflow management system for architectural office | Dirk Tuinman, and Jason Hasler 

The project management project was perfectly managed and well appreciated by the client: &quot;&quot;initial indications are that the new EPM system will make the adminstration of projects easier and more efficient to track, manage and report on, and most importantly, less time consuming&quot;.  

[[Image:AdfArchitechs.jpg |400px]]

}}

A workflow support system for an architectural office resulted in measurable savings in time for the business.  The system, a hybrid project management system, contacts management system and file management was explicitly developed to meet the legal requirements of an architectural practice.

An event management system (Wade et al. 2004) is a tool that produces graphical images and equipment schedules that assist with communication about event layouts between conference centre customers, staff and consultants.  The system quickly became part of the business system, being used to manage 84 major events in the first few months and in active use three years later.  Similar systems cost more than $20,000.

}}

Other business infrastructure financial systems include tenancy management systems, an ecommerce sales system for an international clothing company, and an booking/invoice system for a chain of restaurants.  Each of these, in active use before the end of the project and servicing a critical business function can be seen to be of high value to the business.  Depending on the scale of the system (and business) a commercially developed customised management system could cost anything from $10-100,000.  
Some business infrastructure projects deliver technical solutions.  In 2005 a project for a regional media company delivered the ability to capture and rebroadcast content.  Another project, the Museum Object Acquisition System (Garrett et al.. 2003) provided a 3D artefact display solution for a museum which in currently in active use (www.otagomusuem.govt.nz).  MOAS replaces an object capture approach that had been costing the museum $1000 per object and not delivering the benefits required.  In addition, the museum is still working with the students (now graduates) to market the system itself. 
For some projects the drivers are non-financial.  A rest home management system was driven by changes in health legislation.   
“I write to express my grateful thanks for allowing Leith House to be involved in the third year project that has produced such fine work. I was very happy working with the three students that were involved with this huge undertaking. They were so professional and thorough in their approach. This programme gives to our business a first class professional care package which actually runs the whole of the staffs’ day, enabling them to better deliver the care in a more structured way”. Also, the Health and Disabilities Act has required that we have a system that documents the outcomes of all actions and there are hundreds of these every day. It has been so difficult in the past to be able to measure and portray to the H&amp;D that we meet their requirements. We now have confidence that we have a superb way of proving that we do meet their requirements and deliver the highest care to our residents.  We have now, the tools to achieve great results. I am indebted to your department an am delighted with the excellent result that will be ongoing for many years to come”. 
For some projects the initiative is the development of a new business.  One project, for example, was the development of a platform to support an after school distance tutoring programme.  The successful development of the platform was critical to the ongoing business success.  In another development, a sports management new business is entirely reliant on the sports contract management system developed as a project. 
On a less tangible front, projects may be intended to  support non-business infrastructure.  A race car engine performance monitoring system (Benson et al.  2005) was intended to increase car performance (a commercial but different system retails for $20,000).  Similarly, a cricket training device was intended to improve the reaction time of eye muscles as batsman follow high speed deliveries. 
Such intangible benefits can also be seen in exhibition development (Mann and Smith 2005), a 3D rugby training system and a kiosk for a gold-fields exhibit.  It is, unfortunately, difficult to cost these projects.  The clients are community based institutions with a limited ability to pay.   Many of these developments have wider benefit, Scicards, for example (Goodsir et al. 2005) was part of a wider initiative to promote science to primary age children.   In addition to this perhaps, immeasurable, benefit, the publicity surrounding the initiative was extremely valuable to both the client and institution.  By the time the project was submitted, the webpage (branded with both organisations) had had 14,000 unique visitors and had received extensive media coverage.

Projects supporting school based initiatives and other community projects have had similar outcomes.  At the extreme are projects with community benefits in other countries.  
The marketing value of the projects is difficult to calculate.  Approximately half the projects generate a news item in the regional news media.  Several have been covered in national press (MOAS, SciCards, Rest home, power monitoring), one has been the subject of a TV advertising campaign (Fox et al. 2004) and three have attracted national and international print and television (Smarttop, BallCam, eFence). 
4	Model
It would be possible to formalise the values ascribed to each project and aggregate these values.  This, though, would be a flawed process.  In the somewhat idealised section above too many factors have been ignored.   The notion of “earned value” (Ergdogmus 2002, and Huang and Boehm, 2005) recognises that the benefits ascribed to a development should be tempered by other factors, in our case, the quality of the work. 
We can then, propose a four factor model of earned value for considering capstone projects:
1.	Use of product
2.	Value of process (to client and institution)
3.	Quality of project
4.	Pedagogical benefits

The latter, the pedagogical benefits has been widely discussed elsewhere.  Each of the remaining factors can be defined as follows:
Use of product: the extent to which interacted with by live user within expected lifespan of product; both frequency and intensity of interaction are considered. 
Value of process:  the extent to which being involved in the process generates follow-on business value (to both client and institution).  
Quality of work: quality of produced product or process. 

While recognising that these are not entirely independent measures, we argue that examining capstone projects against these three measures will highlight substantial differences in earned value. 
In the following sections we explore this earned value model by way of application to the existing project set. 
5	Model applied
The full corpora of projects (n=102) were assessed according to the earned value model.  Each project was classified high/medium/low for each measure.   This process was not formalised but done to explore the model.   The summarised data are shown in Table 1 and Figures 2 and 3.

Figure 3: Key clusters highlighted 

 
Figure 3 shows the datacube with key clusters highlighted.  The interaction of the measures can be seen with a dominance of the ordinal, with a reasonably even distribution along it.   In the section below we examine the characteristics of key clusters, both the strong (frequent) groups and those that are weak or missing from the corpora. 
5.1	High use product

5.1.1	7 High product, high process, high quality 
This group of projects are the star projects described as exemplars in Mann and Smith (2004, 2005).  They are the high quality projects that delivered both product and process benefits for the client. 
These projects tend to be for repeat clients.  Most of these are local government or community institutions (museum, library etc) but the project types are wide ranging.   Examples in this group include exhibition developments, an event management system and a 3D object capture system, all of them could be considered total systems that are well packaged.  Almost all had an early delivery of functional product. 
Two slightly lower quality projects achieved the same outcomes in product and process, but without spark. 

5.1.2	6 High product, medium process, high quality

A second group of projects had high value products but the clients probably did not get as much from the process itself.   The common thread in these projects is a slightly distant client (emotion rather than distance): an accounting system was developed for a client who was instructed by head office to deploy such a system, a school technician was told he was having a project done for him, an academic stood in for an absent 
colleague, and so on.

Projects might include significant event management.

}}

5.1.3	5 High product, medium process, medium quality 

This group can be characterised as having a keen client with clearly scoped project and the project team got away with slightly lower quality of work.  These are mainly web-database systems but with some back-end application processing (cf just data i/o) or more complex display or interactivity (eg spatial). 
Only two projects got away with being of very low quality but still resulted in a highly useful product.   One of these was working with an education development – deficiencies were overshadowed by excited children, the other, the development of a database to support homestay accommodation – although poorly designed and implemented – anything would have been an improvement on the non-functional paper system.  

5.1.4	9 High product, low process, high or medium quality 
These projects have high product high use despite little involvement of client in the development process.  They tend to be projects with tightly defined functional requirements at outset and tight simple solutions.  Seven of these projects involved electronic or microprocessors developments.  
Only one project managed high product with low process despite low quality (gaming house).  This for a client so desperately in need of help that anything would be beneficial, the product developed was functional but it was poorly written, had poor design etc. 

5.2	Medium product use

5.2.1	3 Medium product use, high value process, high or medium quality

Only three projects fall into this category.  These are projects for which the major benefit for the client is in the process.  The actual product may be a little disappointing.  Two of these were educational infrastructure projects, the third a sports training simulator.  For all, the product is in actual use but the far greater benefit to the client was the increased understanding of their own needs and/or community involvement in the development process. 

In the case of the 3D rugby decision simulation, while the product was actively used for a three month period during development, it was not packaged in such a way as to allow extensive further use.  The improved understanding of their own business (sporting) context has had great benefit to the client who is now leading the development of an integrated system for the national union. 

5.2.2	3 Medium product use, medium value process, high quality.
Only three projects fall into this category of being considered high quality products but only reaching medium product and process value.  

One of these was a project management system that the group scoped down during development to a relatively small tool.  This superbly developed tool was perhaps too elegant for the client who, expecting complexity, clung to existing systems and failed to use the tool to its full potential.   An almost identical scenario can be seen for a tourism familiarisation tool that was too elegant for its own good.  
One excellent project has only had medium use and had little process benefit, halfway through the project the client decided to buy the expensive alternative commercial product with less features.  The group carried on to complete the project.   

These projects could perhaps be seen as slight overkill, the academic imperative of excellence setting a 
higher standard than was needed for the industrial reality. 

5.2.3	10 Medium product use, medium value process, medium quality.
This large group of projects could have been much more exciting.  Medium quality work turned them into workman-like rather than their exciting potential.  These are mostly web-database systems that we could call content management systems, but in reality are dynamic websites that are somewhat light on functionality and content.    For several, the missing factor was adequate testing prior to deployment so that while in use, some features are not working properly, meaning the system’s ongoing utility is limited. 
A further nine projects are low value in process and only had medium uptake of products.  These are largely adequate projects but again, they didn’t quite live up to expectation.  In this group are several eCommerce websites that, while functional, did not quite make it to being fully integrated. 

5.3	Low product use

5.3.1	Low product use but high quality
Only three projects here deemed of high quality.  One had  high process value; although the project originally intended a development stage, the analysis became the focus of the project.  It is perhaps not surprising that with an emphasis on implementation and deployment in assessment, this is the only ‘process project’ 
The two high quality projects with low product use and low process value can be considered as missed opportunities.  Both of these are excellent technical developments (and both won external awards) but we failed to capitalise on the developments.


5.3.2	7 High process value, medium and low quality

These are projects that despite a lack of use of the product and varying quality of work, can be seen to have been of high value to the client.  In most cases the client went on to develop products using ideas developed in the project. For all of these the original intention was a working product but most finished up being “first-failure call it prototype 1”.   Despite being apparent failings, some of these projects have had significant impact on the client’s business.  The electric fence data network, for example, was a long way off “product” but has lead to substantial development income for the client.  We have tried in recent years to avoid projects that might be seen as failed developments such as these, rather we have recast them in early stages of development as having a product: that being an intentional prototype (or series of prototypes) to answer specific questions.  


5.3.3	18 medium process, medium/low quality
These are project for which no product was produced but there were still some benefits to the client.  Some have made a business pathway clear, sometimes that this is in an area worth investing in, in others, an area or technical approach they wish to avoid.  
Strangely perhaps, this group contains several intentional prototype projects.   It seems that when we switch focus to a prototype development, a higher (or at least different) set of requirements become apparent.  While the required experimental approach might be understood by academics, in particular that a well designed experiment with negative results is better than a poor experiment with apparently positive results, this approach has not been well adopted by students.  

In one case a group failed to understand the effects of scale on perception for a set of reaction time training lights.  In another, a GIS/GPS development got bogged down in a tangential technical area but missed the overriding question about utility initially posed by the client.   Several projects took simply too long to reach a first prototype stage – a stable platform that would have allowed testing of concepts.   Sometimes a macho attitude towards the use of tools such as phidgets (Greenberg and Fitchett 2001) may be to blame here with students instead struggling to program in assembler or low level tools. 
It is interesting that some of the most innovative and media friendly projects are in this category.

5.3.4	11 Low process, medium and low quality
It is difficult to see benefits to clients for this category at the opposite end of the spectrum from the “star projects”.  In some cases the only benefit is in the 4th dimension, the pedagogical benefits, but for most these projects are not successful.
These projects have little in common in terms of complexity, type of project or scope.  They do, however, mostly (9/11) share a characteristic of not having a “real client”, instead having internal clients or Chinese-wall structures. 
6	Discussion
The value of projects is likely to become an increasingly important aspect of capstone projects.  
The earned value model may be of use in each of the various stages of each capstone project.  In the initiation stage, the intended positioning of the project on the model could be used in communication between client, students and supervisors.  It is hoped that this positioning will provide a common understanding of the benefits of the proposed development.  
At the end of the project, a positioning on the model might aid in assessment.  This would clarify the contribution the work has made and make explicit any claims made as to product value.  The awkward “client satisfaction” can be usefully disaggregated into product and process.   The act of positioning one’s own project on the model may be a useful catalyst in the reflective process for students.
During development the intended position on the model may be useful in determining direction for the project.  This may be particularly the project is (by design or accident) becoming the development of a prototype. The characteristics of  previous projects in this category highlight a fine line between value and situations where the work involved outweighs benefits to the client.  
This work has highlighted that we do need to be cautious about claims for value of end product.   It is too easy to claim benefits on the basis of what the product might be able to do, any attempt to place a monetary value on projects (individually or in aggregate) should carefully take into account the earned value, that is the quality of the projects and the separately costed benefits for product and process.    A useful area of further research would be to develop costing questions and equations for the different value categories. 
At a wider level the distribution of the projects on the model raises management questions.   Clearly we would want all projects to fall in the top right – generating high value to clients in process, product and the academic stamp of quality, but equally clearly; most projects fall short of this goal.   We can and should ask ourselves what factors drive projects down on one or more axis? 
One factor is the choice of projects, perhaps sub optimal from client’s perspective.   Choices made for pedagogical benefits reduce efficiency.  The technical complexity requirements of a project (ie we don’t give credit for typing) may conflict with the desire of client who wants a webpage – instead we insist on developing a content management system (sometimes less than successfully).  
Another consideration is the assessment of ongoing value.   The model has helped identify some projects that have missed their potential.   Initiatives to develop innovation processes involving appraisal of product portfolios could use a model such as this to identify potential products for commercialisation. 
We are not all content with the cluster at the bottom left.   While some of these projects may have been suitable learning experiences for the students, there is a significant potential damaging effect on community relations.  We should ensure that where clients are involved, is at least medium value for product or more likely process for the client – this will have impact on the choice of project.   Fortunately, or perhaps it was a contributing factor, most of these poor projects did not have a direct client relationship. 
This model also leads to consideration of what are we looking for in projects.   Most capstone courses attempt a balance of product and process in teaching (Clear et al 2001), a model such as this may help in identifying alternative approaches.

When we took on the Scicards project the client was already committed to going live with the system in less than a month.   The value proposition and the order of development was critical to the success of this project. 

The effect of this was that between 29th April and 31 October 2005 when the project was finished, the site had already had more that 14,000 unique visitors, 2855 on one day that the site featured on national television. 

This responsive and robust delivery was matched by a strong focus on the needs of the users, bourne out by feedback:

[[Image:Scicards3.gif |left]] SciCards is a nationwide promotion with over 170,000 cards distributed throughout the country. SciCards Online originated from the Otago Museum’s SciCards project, funded by the Royal Society of New Zealand and IBM. It is a trading card project aimed at building an appreciation of science and technology in young persons throughout New Zealand, aged between eight and twelve. 

The project was divided up into three different release dates in April, July and September.  2005.  Each release consisted of five different cards some of which linked to online activities on the website.

The group's role was:
* Building SciCards Online – including the ‘look and feel’, infrastructure and content
* Creating and implementing online activities relative to particular SciCards
* Creating a virtual Collectors Book for cards to be stored and played with
* Creating rewards for collection of cards and completion of activities

We designed the content for all of the above, and contracted the artwork to an illustrator as per our specification.

[[Image:Scicards2.gif]]

Countless hours were spent establishing a stable platform for our first release which was due approximately four weeks after our initial project meeting.  Our stable platform was a prototype with a database connection to the local server BITDEV at Otago Polytechnic, which was successful and helped us in further testing before we deployed it.

The stable platform involved building an Information System that was used to collect user information and their respective cards. Once this was completed we concentrated on creating the content of the website.  This entailed many brainstorming group sessions and resulted in storyboards used to illustrate our ideas for the ‘look and feel’ of the website.

The storyboards were approved and discussed with the client and the illustrator prior to illustration.  These were supplied disjointedly, due to the illustrator having other commitments.  Within two weeks of the release date we received some of the illustrations, others only came days before the release date.  One huge factor to this was that the client changed the release date to earlier. Due to the time restriction we had to sit down with the client and prioritise which components of the website were the most important. 

Functional Requirements for the First Release are as follows:

The system as implemented does:
* Allow users to register and login
* Allow users to participate with three online activities
* Allow users to add and record cards online through codes
* Record and supply survey results 
* Enable users to arrange/link cards
* Enable users to save data
* Enable users to give feedback
* Enable users to view facts 
* Keep track of facts viewed by users
* Personalise user’s environment
* Keep track of completed activities
* Activate cards on completion of activities
* Provide an opportunity for users to learn and interact in science and technology
* An Interactive Front Page
* SciCards Registration System
* Registered Users Database
* Hair Activity
* Shoe Activity
* Amend Sport Activity to suit requirements
* User’s Science Appreciation Survey
* Storage of Survey Results
* Collector’s Book System
* Collector’s Strategy Page
* Feedback

The Hair Activity, for example was designed to encourage young scientists to think about specific ingredients in hair products. The user applies the products and the hair reacts according to the hair type.

In the shoe activity, the users examined the functionality of the components of a shoe.
Including the different compounds that make up the components of a shoe and how different components apply to different sports/activities.

The Sport Activity enabled users to learn about gravity and action through the trajectory of 
projected objects.  Demonstrated by catching interesting objects. 

The Collector’s Book System is where users can collect and store their virtual cards. Users can view pop-up facts as they collect each card.  Linking and arranging the cards in a special way led to rewards during the year.  

We delivered a fully functional system to the client on the 29th April 2005 meeting all requirements stated above.  This set a precedence for the rest of the project and showed that we were competent and committed to meeting the client’s requests. 
 
The first release was performed under intense time constraints.  In the second stage, decisions were made to ensure a robust system that would provide durability.  

After much discussion with the client regarding the longevity of the project, long-term in-house management and the possibility of extending the life of SciCards Online we undertook some investigation and recommended adopting a commercial provider and recommended GeneratorWEB as the long term solution.  The system required a stable platform and an actively maintained database which we were unable to provide at the end of the project.

Mike Hodges of GeneratorWEB was contracted at this point in time to allow for the compatibility of the components developed by us with regard to GeneratorWEB.

Now with a new management system, a whole new set of functional requirements was required. Our main objective was to concentrate on the development of the content of the website, and we also had to assist in the transition to GeneratorWEB by amending our files from the First Release.  Mike Hodges was able to use the database developed by us.

Requirements for the Second Release – fulfilled to client’s satisfaction

* Travel Activity
* ‘What’s that Smell?’ Activity
* Special Effect Reward for Sports Card
* Tailor existing SciCards Website to meet GeneratorWEB’s requirements
* User’s Science Appreciation Survey Two
* Collector’s Book System – additional changes


A special reward animated the Sports Card.  Upon entering the Sports Card into the Collector’s Book, the card came alive!  The reward system was initiated to encourage users to add their virtual cards to their Collector’s Book and complete activities.

Third Release was 1st September 2005

Requirements for the Third Release – fulfilled to client’s satisfaction 

* Animation Activity
* ChatBot Activity:Enable users to interact with an online Chatbot – named SciBot
* Travel Activity Reward: Reward for completing the Travel Activity
Upon completing the Travel Activity, a secret Code is revealed – when entered into the users’ Collector’s Book the cycling character rides his bicycle around the book.
* Cardiovascular Pop-up Animation 
* Screen Saver Reward
* Collector’s Book Alterations:  This Reward is for collecting all the cards and loading them into the Collectors Book. Once all the cards have been added, the user must link all the cards together by dragging the images as per the hints on the back  of each card.  This in turn pops up the hidden Cardiovascular System printed on  on the backs of the cards.  A Screen Saver Reward links from the Cardiovascular Pop-up Animation and allows users to download a special SciCards Screen Saver. 


''We are proud of our project and how we have handled the challenges we faced.  SciCards Online has been a monumental success, including television appearances, newspaper articles and positive feedback from all over the country.  ''

''The expectations throughout the project were extremely high and the pressure was felt by everyone involved.''
''
SciCards Online has been up and running since 29th April 2005 (First Release), and has been robust and consistent throughout the year. The database records as well as website statistics prove that the system has been in use since the first release.'' 

''We believe that starting our project immediately, with early deliverables required us to be extremely organised in our approach to project management.  Documenting everything as it happened also was a great tool for keeping track of the project’s progress – being able to look back at what we had written helped us understand exactly what was going on at that point in time.  Approximately 80% of the time working on our project was spent working together – we feel this worked well for us, as we always knew what each other was doing, where we were at and how much we had to go.  Fortunately there was no group conflict.''

''Throughout our project we were always aiming for 110% we wanted to be the best we could be, and be proud of ourselves at the end.  We each believe that we have done very well, to accomplish this much from where we started.''
 
''Our Third Year Project has prepared us for “the challenges that lie ahead” by equipping us with the necessary skills to manage projects, deadlines and client relations. These are all skills that we will use in the future.''

The rainbow sector diagrams in the book are intended as templates for steering your own project. In the first two iterations we have linked the boxes, in the third iteration the sectors are blank.

The trick is to get from the inputs on the left to the outputs on the right.

1.  Draw the activities you need to get from the inputs to the outputs.  If something is not driving towards the output, then ask yourself, why are we doing this?

2. Pay attention to all five workstreams.

==Examples==
===Capstone Project===
The capstone project is an important component of most Information Technology degrees, the Bachelor of Information Technology (B.InfoTech) at Otago Polytechnic is no exception.  A complete list of projects is online at [http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/schools-departments/information-technology/bitweb/projects/recent-projects.html www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz]

Fincher et al. (2001) describe “keys for success” for projects.  While they intend these measures to be used in establishing programmes, rather than specific projects, they do present a useful yardstick for successful projects.    The Otago B.InfoTech is perhaps unique in its strengths in complete systems, including both hardware and software.


A significant challenge in the design of capstone courses is relationship between process and product.  As academics we argue that a strong process will result in a good product but instructors face little direction in the identification of a suitable process.  A major issue is that of systematically incorporating prototypes into the software design and development lifecycle.  In this paper we have identified a development framework which successfully does that integration.  This framework was developed from exemplar projects and provides a best system framework.   The framework is also used to explore the development process of weaker projects.  


=== Role of development methodology ===

This chapter aims to explore the role of development methodology in successful capstone projects, in particular the extent, nature and integration of prototyping.

In computing development projects the choice of development methodology is as perennial a subject for debate as is the choice of programming language.  A methodology has to be selected for any given project and the selection may be based on a myriad of factors.  Many educational institutions contain a capstone project whereby students, often in groups, work to complete a significant project.   The choice of development process becomes pivotal in a capstone project (Beasley 2003; Chamillard and Goold 2003;. Bridgeman 2003, Clear 2003).  In computing education, the choice is complicated by the introduction of the teaching imperative.  The issue we face is finding not only the best approach for development but the best approach for teaching it.

Clear et al. (2001) described what they call the “process versus product tension” (p95) in the design of capstone courses.  They refer to the decision as to whether the focus of the capstone course should be on the development process, or on the product of that development: a working system.  They argue that as the capstone course emulates work as a professional “it is advisable that an acceptable methodology or process be adopted and followed. What specific methodology or adaptation thereof is chosen is less important than the use of some formal process”.  Chamillard and Braun (2002) describe the problem thus: 

{{cquote| “Given the importance of process in real software development activities, we want to ensure that our students get appropriate exposure to process issues. On the other hand, we also do not want our students to believe that if they follow an appropriate process, it does not matter if they generate a working product! We must therefore also provide the appropriate emphasis on the product the students are developing to ensure it meets the project requirements”.  (p229) |||}}


What then, is an appropriate process for capstone projects?  Traditionally, most capstone courses have used a derivation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC, eg that described by Hoffer et al. 1999).  In recent years, instructional designers have mixed this with components of agile modelling and especially prototyping (Fincher et al. 2001).  

Hakim and Spitzer (2000) argue that the “challenge is to systematically incorporate prototypes into the software design and development lifecycle”.   

In this paper we aim to identify a framework for successful projects.


=== Exemplar projects ===
 
In the following sections we examine the qualitative evidence of the development process of exemplar projects.  Groups were selected to give a range of project category.  Quotes are given from the students’ reflective reviews to portray the complexity of the decisions and process.

{{Adfexemplar | ACKI | Kevin Barclay |

The ACKI development aimed to create a box that sits between computer and keyboard, for users with limited mobility (Barclay et al. 2001).  This was a generic solution for the needs of unique users.  The box emulated the keyboard to feed analog or digital input form any device.

Several aspects of the development process stand out.  A stable testbed was established meaning that a detailed testing protocol could be established with an integrated test routine.  The group kept a detailed log book of process and defined test outcomes. 
Different levels of prototype met different needs, the testbed was used to investigate technical issues, while whiteboard pens emulated joysticks to explore level of control, what does input device need to do.

This project aligns with an Agile Development Framework even though it was a hardware based project.  For each component “miniature lifecycles” were used with an – analyse-design-test cycle.

}}

{{Adfexemplar |School network | Boudewyn Erkens, Lorna Lou, Rebecca Sidaway |


This project aimed to meet the ICT needs of a local primary school.  In addition to network design and implementation, the group worked closely with the teachers in meeting professional development needs.  While the project was hardware and training, the group followed the topdown structure of the SDLC.  The training needs in particular were met through training needs analysis and then lessons were designed and implemented.  The network solution was prototyped using a rapid installation and borrowed equipment which the school used for a month to see if the solution met their needs.

5.7	Alternative CAD interface
The SDLC was used as the basis for a project that aimed to develop a drawing board interface to architectural CAD systems (Lawton and Meikle 2003).    Much of the project was development and configuration of hardware and then user testing of each iteration.  The team developed many different prototype systems, and although using many of the same components, they built largely from scratch each time on a rig they developed.

“Aspects of prototyping were revisited again and again ...  and again.  Some aspects proved to be overly time consuming, and in one case a decision had to be discarded for this very reason.”

“Paper” interfaces will be developed with the assistance of architectural draughting students.  The students will be asked to evaluate each version of the interface and contribute suggestions or criticisms.  This will influence the following draught of the interface, as well as the requirements of the menu file (the interface code for the CAD application).

The hardware will be assembled and installed for testing with potential users.  As with the criticisms, observations and suggestions will be evaluated and incorporated into the system.  This stage is repeated until the functional requirements have been met”

The iterative stages of analysis, logical design and prototyping were run concurrently.  Aspects of the project involving prototyping included a drawing surface, the construction of the frame, a pointing device, the projection system and the customisation of the AutoCAD interface.  Problems were encountered, as well as unforeseen benefits of the system.

5.8	SMS
The development of a system for the control of several remote devices via a cellphone was the goal of this group. This system involved the development and integration of several hardware and software components.  The group followed an SDLC process, developing a hardware and software prototype in analysis:
“we threw together an application…after getting this test application working we came up with a few problems with our design…we now had our functional requirements nailed down, and signed off, and could continue in-depth planning…”

The group developed a working system “prototype” and in implementation replaced major components sequentially. 

5.9	Edubuilder
The construction industry is an area where there are multiple layers of complexity, interacting roles, differing timescales and consequences of decisions.  This is a prime target for a good interactive learning experience supported by technology.  This project undertook to provide a content management system in an area where there is a vast store of expert knowledge available but few good information sources that take advantage of interactive media.  
The group followed the SDLC and began by working through a huge pile of building standards and struggled to find an underlying theme to hold it together.  They used several metaphors before coming back to the building itself and the project plan chart.   They developed a diagrammatic prototype and in discussion with several “clients” it became apparent that the different timescales, contexts and user views of a Gannt chart, that this was the elusive concept.  To test this premise the group developed several prototypes to prove the concept, these ranged from a single sketch to a semi-functional interactive mockup of the system.  These prototypes were used to explicitly test various aspects of the premise.
In order to implement this concept the group realised some complex technical procedures were needed.  The group used a carefully managed testing regime that identified a need for a test, the development of code, a test procedure and recording.
As requirements were well defined, a stable system was developed and a rigorous testing regime utilised, the implementation at the end of the project was remarkably rapid yet the deliverable was robust and useful.
5.10	 Information system for suit hire
Despite being an ideal candidate for a traditional information system, the client for this project was not entirely convinced that he needed a computerised system.  To alleviate this concern the group developed an early prototype on the computer that mirrored the paper based system.  The client was convinced that he would gain efficiency while not losing the basis of the paper based system.  This prototype also allowed the development of strong functional requirements.  The group was also able to test their understanding of the current system by “operating” the prototype in parallel with the existing system, at the clients’ premises.  
Once analysis was completed, the group discarded the prototype.  They then went through normal logical and physical design involving several prototypes.  The client was unavailable for five months during this stage but the group was able to test the prototypes according to the strong functional requirements they had developed.  The resulting system was substantially different from the original prototype in operation of the business but it retained the look of the paper based system.
5.11	Familtrak
A familiarisation tour (“famil”) is a trip taken by people in the travel agency to familiarise themselves with the products they are selling.  They are supposed to write up an account on their return but hardly ever do.  The client for this project wanted a system to facilitate the reporting and dissemination of such.  This was much more than a simple database, the solution involved a webpage, XML, GIS and a high degree of interactivity (Hamilton 2003).
.The initial functional requirements were worked out between the group and the client.  The group then undertook several weeks of validating and improving the functional requirements.  This included much observation of work patterns, a questionnaire and a paper based prototype.  A prototype was first used to represent the set of functions the system would be required to carry out. In logical design, a second paper based prototype was used to develop the structure of the system. The group first tested the prototype entirely on paper with the client, and then in a very clever move scanned in the paper and linked it together, resulting in a low fidelity but high interactivity prototype.  This meant that “testing was completed before any code was written”.
The was released to the client for actual production use three months before due date and the group was then able to work on perfecting the system and developing some of the more difficult aspects (linking spatial and multimedia aspects).
6	Exemplar Processes
From the exemplar projects some themes emerge.   These we distil into an exemplar development framework.

1.	“SDLC”  identified methodology
2.	Prototyping used
3.	Strong functional requirements used
4.	Functional requirements tested with low fidelity but high interactivity prototypes
5.	Stable platform for development developed early
6.	Prototypes part of integrated testing plan
7.	Early functional deliverable to client
8.	Robust final deliverable
9.	Still need ‘normal’ design – prototyping doesn’t replace
10.	Prototypes used in communication with client
11.	Maturation by revolutionary (cf evolutionary).  Staged replacement for hardware.

Some of these factors are perhaps expected measures of quality; it is not surprising that they appear here: we did not look at spelling or good intra-group communication but they would be expected on such a framework also.   What we have though is evidence that the exemplar groups do these things.   Some factors are surprising; we did not expect to find the maturation process so similar for the exemplar projects.

7	Validation
In order to further explore the importance of the development framework, we undertook an analysis of the full set of documented projects.  The first author worked through the documentation with a third person who did not know the history of the projects to assign a five point scale to each of eleven factors.  These scores are compared to the grades for the projects.
It should be noted that this analysis uses grade used as measure for quality and we recognise that there are other factors at play here.  We also recognise the potential bias of the authors in making this assessment, although this should have been partially mitigated by the impartial third person.
A simple summation of the eleven factors provides a very high correlation (r=0.756) with the grade received for each project (Figure 3: for this and subsequent statistics the exemplar projects are excluded).  Further, the relationship is not affected by the type of project.    
 
 

Figure 3:  Process score summation is closely related to quality, this is unaffected by the project type.

Figure 4 shows all the projects assessed according to the development framework.  All factors are positively correlated with the grade.  
Some anomalous projects can be identified:  Project “78 HW A” was a hardware procurement project that did not follow the framework, whereas “174 IS A-” was a retrospective project where processes had been followed but evidence was lacking resulting in a slightly lower grade.  
Most of the constituent factors that make up this score could be considered general measures of quality.  Other measures such as efficacy of group work, or spelling, would probably also have positive relationships.  This is still useful, we would also identify these factors as critical success factors.   Some of the factors are not quite so obvious; the type of implementation – revolutionary or staged replacement as opposed to evolutionary – is striking in the pattern of being carried out by better groups.  
 

Figure 4: Projects assessed by development framework, ordered from top by grade. The darker shading indicates a 4 or 5 where this factor is used.  Exemplar projects above the line.

Perhaps more important than the overall correlations of the process factors, is the relationships between them at different ends of the spectrum – what are the poorer groups doing differently?
By examining Figure 4 carefully (or looking at the correlations – not shown), some interesting patterns emerge.  Poorer groups did less prototyping, which is understandable; they did less of other things too.  What is critical is that when they did prototyping they did not also do “normal design” nor have stable systems, early delivery etc.   Poorer groups that used prototypes in early stages also had very weak functional requirements, did not have strong testing plans etc, in other words the prototype became the development in total.   Groups in the middle ranges that did prototypes tended to have weaker logical and physical design, instead they saw the development as one of making the prototype robust.  
These patterns can also be seen in the comments of the marking panel for groups in the lower half of the grades (Table 2). 

Wrote code as proof of concept prototype then tried to design it.  'one half of the team was designing and the other half coding and both at different rates' 

Technical decisions made in getting prototype out haunted later development good process limited by technical skills

Functional prototype developed early but without design, that bad design stuck, Digitised a bad process as some stages of SDLC missed.

Initial concepts done with prototype, anything deemed to be too hard never got considered as a real requirement SDLC but skipped from initial idea to implementation

Couldn't achieve much technical complexity so scoped down to make prototype deliverable

After successful prototype almost no progress for the rest of the year.  At last minute, they independently implement the rest of it and retrospectively did SDLC analysis

Prototype developed for proof of concept stuck SDLC very weak.. Client happy but insufficient technical complexity

Palm development.  Never had stable platform.  Couldn't make it work.

8	Conclusion
Hakim (2000) argued that the “challenge is to systematically incorporate prototypes into the software design and development lifecycle”.  In this paper we have identified a development framework which successfully does that integration.  This framework was developed from exemplar projects and provides a best system framework.  

Stein (2002) also identifies properties common to successful projects.  But cautions “it is true however, for each property I can find … less successful project(s) containing the same property”.  By examining how the development framework compares with what poorer groups are doing, we have been able to identify how this framework might apply to weaker groups.  In particular, we have demonstrated the risk of weaker groups doing prototypes instead of normal design, or conversely, sticking to a naïve view of the SDLC that results in poorly tested designs.  

This paper has not considered the level of technical complexity of a project.  Goold (2003) discusses the effect of both technical skills of group members and the scope of the proposed project.  It would be worth examining the complexity of projects, and how this relates to both the grade and the development framework adopted.   We found that the framework applies equally well across different types of project (see also Avrahani 2002).  

The tension between product and process can be lessened by adopting a process that can be seen to produce good products while being flexible and robust.  We believe that the development framework developed in this paper will provide a foundation for capstone courses.

4	Results

4.1	Initial findings
It is worth investigating external features of the projects to indicate development characteristics of successful projects.  
Between 2001 and 2003, 65 projects have been completed.  35% gained As, 32% Bs, 16% C and 17% failed.  The projects can classified into eight categories as shown in Table 1 along with marks distributions for each.  With some small exceptions (“total systems” are all successful, ‘hardware’ has a higher than expected failure rate), there are no strong relationships between the type of project and the grade.   Good grades are possible whatever the type of project.

Table 1: Classification of projects and grade distribution.

Figure 1:   Effect of group size on project grade.

There is an effect of group size, as shown in Figure 1.  While groups of two or three show similar patterns, the students working alone have a much higher chance of failure.  We believe that there are two underlying factors here: the quality of students (i.e. why are they working alone), and that they miss the benefits of working in a group.  

Most students follow a document centred development approach.  The students were wrong however, size does not count, the rumour about assigning grades by weight is not true.   Figure 1 demonstrates a very weak relationship between the final grade and the number of pages in the documentation (n=49, complete documentation available in the library).  Once above a minimum threshold of around 100 pages, any grade is possible. There are a cluster of top grades at around 260 pages.  The projects with greatest amount of documentation did not get top grades and clearly poor projects cannot be rescued by a mass of documentation.

 
Figure 2:  Weak relationship between pages and grade (n=49)

Good projects can not be identified by type of project nor by the quantity of work.  So we come back to the question, what are the good groups doing?

In the traditional waterfall model, very little coding was performed the until the Implementation stage - a long way through the project.   Such structured developments work best when:

- a set of high quality, stable user requirements exist

- the developers have previously built similar systems

- the project is not very complex

These characteristics are rare, especially in student projects.

In Rapid Application Development, on the other hand, coding starts almost on day one, the developed system is, by definition, used to describe its own requirements.  This works well when the system is not very complex an incremental build is feasible, that is, each functional component can be added to the system without disruption. 

We have already identified that the Agile Development Framework a compromise between structured and agile methods, here we do it again, and describe the ADF as a revolutionary prototyping methodology.  

Three components: prototyping; methodology and revolutionary (OK, slightly different order).  

Let’s start with what a prototype is not: it is not the name we give to a failed first attempt: a prototype is something we do on purpose in order to answer a specific question.  

A prototype is defined by Sallis et al (1995) as a “'''working model'''”.  This suggests a level of abstraction: the “working” suggests that the system functions - the “model” suggests that it doesn’t.  Together this means that a prototype is a cutdown version, the bits we need are there, the bits we don’t - are cut away. Determining what it is that we need is determined by the question we are trying to answer.  

This is a methodology, it is not hacking.  A hacking approach is one where, given a problem, you sit down and start programming.  This might work for tiny projects or for hobby development where it alright to figure out the specifications as you go and adapt the code.   It does not work for more complex systems where the need to rework generates high costs at a late stage.  

The prototyping model has several advantages;

- Ability to place a functioning and useful system in hands of users quickly

- Information requirements do not have to be completed before effort starts

- Ability to try out ideas without high risk or cost

- Increase in users’ interest and understanding in process

- Increase in users’ interest and satisfaction with final system.
  
The most important aspect of a prototype is that it adds to your knowledge.  It should be developed with that in mind.  This is where the rigour of prototyping comes in.  There are several complete prototyping methodologies such as Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) but we use a more tried and tested approach: scientific method. 

Question: sometimes formulated into a hypothesis

Method: a carefully designed test to give an answer to that question (and nothing else, the notion of ‘barely sufficient’ applies here)

Evaluate answer 

We also argue for an '''revolutionary''' approach to prototypes.  This means that while we learn from each prototype, little, if any of their construction is carried forward.  This is sometimes referred to as “throwaway prototypes”.  

The concept of throwaway prototypes was applied to computing by Brooks in his famous search for a magical silver bullet in Mythical Man Month (1975) where he argued “plan to throw one any, you will anyhow”.  While the book (and its advice) is still highly regarded, this quote is now regarded (including by Brooks) as bit simplistic.  His argument assumed a standard waterfall model but where you have two tries at getting it right.  

Throwaway prototypes avoid some of the potential disadvantages of prototypes:

- the danger of users being unwilling to give up the prototype is avoided.   As prototypes are explicitly used in order to answer specific questions, the users know that from the outset that this is not “the” system.  This means you are not put in the position of saying “you know that system we delivered a few months ago, well it turns out it was quite buggy so here’s a new one”.

- the danger of prototypes becoming a substitute for analysis is avoided as the prototypes are explicitly for the purpose of analysis and design.

- the danger of work arounds and quick fixes becoming entrenched in production code is avoided as ideas and techniques are pushed forward, not actual code.  We do need to be careful to recognise the difference between prototype and production.  A production system will have quality code, validation, backup, recovery etc, while a prototype might have none of these things.

The figure below shows the role of construction and prototyping throughout the development process.

Matt describes his client centred prototyping approach: 
{{cquote|From the start our team wanted to include the client as much as we could in the development process.  There is a risk that the client will not follow the development process.  This could result in a misalignment of concepts ideas.  We thought this would reduce the possible risks involved.  To address this problem we implemented design and testing of the interface with the client.  Some mock-ups wire frames were created.  A simple web site was created to demonstrate the interactivity and actions of the application.  This was received well by the client and actually brought about a redefinition of the application’s focus.  A few of the interfaces were developed with the clients input.  Looking back this was a very demonstrated to me when another project group was having difficulty with their client.  The client was expecting something different from what was presented. }}

This paper examines the use of biomimicry in software engineering.  By adopting the models of nature, we might hope to work more sustainably and produce more sustainable products. Could this be a way to the paradigm shift we have been looking for? To this end, perhaps nature and biomimicry could be super system metaphors for the development of sustainable software products.
In software development the system metaphor has been adopted as a core practice by the agile community. Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained (2000) defines a system metaphor as: 

&quot;a story that everyone - customers, programmers, and managers - can tell about how the system works.&quot;

 The paper describes system metaphors and then examines work in this field.


==Introduction==

In this paper we explore options to give software engineering a heart of green. 
Blevis (2007) describes a broad approach that brings together computing (HCI) and sustainability in a way that benefits both streams.  He argues that sustainability &quot;can and should be a central focus of interaction design.&quot; But, Blevis later (2008) writes &quot;the moment you decide sustainability is an issue with respect to interaction design and the design of interactive devices is the moment you realize how complex the business of deciding what to actually do about it is.  It is not just a simple matter of calculating the energy and environmental costs of manufacturing, use, salvage, and disposal of one technology over another&quot;.  

So what is it a matter of?

Blevis suggests five principles to underpin Sustainable Interaction Design:  (i) linking invention and disposal (ii) promoting renewal and reuse (iii) promoting quality and equality (iv) decoupling ownership and identity and (v) using natural models and reflection. 

In this paper, we focus on the last of these principles and ask, what is the nature of this &quot;use natural models and reflection&quot;.  Although Blevis focuses on Interaction Design, we look more broadly at software engineering as a whole.  

==Sustainability in software engineering ==
Following Hanks ''et al.'' (2008), we focus on the link between sustainability and information technologies in two broad senses: (i) ''sustainability through software engineering —''how systems can be used to promote more sustainable behaviours; and (ii) ''sustainability in software engineering''—how sustainability can be used as a critical lens in the design of technologies themselves. 

We focus on software engineering because, in addition to software driving demand for new hardware, software drives a wider set of values, beliefs and behaviours in society such that sustainability should be considered in software development process.
Software engineering has perhaps already adopted a sustainable approach without explicitly realising it - Agile proponents at least. The language of software engineering is already close to sustainability – discussions on stakeholders, interaction, and system requirements perhaps give evidence to an extant systems approach. 

Blevis proposes a rubric, which, while intended for artefacts of interaction design, can be extended to wider software engineering: 
The items of Blevis\’ rubric are:

1. Disposal - does the design cause the disposal of physical material, directly or indirectly and even if the primary material of the design is digital material?

2. Salvage - does the design enable the recovery of previously discarded physical material, directly or indirectly and even if the primary material of the design

3. Recycling - does the design make use of recycled physical materials or provide for the future recycling of physical materials, directly or indirectly and even if the primary material of the design is digital material?

4. Remanufacturing for reuse - does the design provide for the renewal of physical material for reuse or updated use, directly or indirectly and even if the primary material of the design is digital material?

5. Reuse as is - does the design provide for transfer of ownership, directly or indirectly and even if the primary material of the design is digital material?

6. Achieving longevity of use - does the design allow for long term use of physical materials by a single owner without transfer of ownership, directly or indirectly and even if the primary material of the design is digital material?

7. Sharing for maximal use - does the design allow for use of physical materials by many people as a construct of dynamic ownership, directly or indirectly and even if the primary material of the design is digital material?

8. Achieving heirloom status - does the design create artifice of long-lived appeal that motivates preservation such that transfer of ownership preserves quality of experience, directly or indirectly and even if the primary material of the design is digital material?

9. Finding wholesome alternatives to use - does the design eliminate the need for the use of physical resources, while still preserving or even ameliorating qualities of life in a manner that is sensitive to and scaffolds human motivations and desires?

10. Active repair of misuse - is the design specifically targeted at repairing the harmful effects of unsustainable use, substituting sustainable use in its place?

Recognising that this incorporation of sustainability is complex, Blevis is not claiming to have all the answers (or even all the questions). He does though pose some valuable research questions which he breaks into two sections. The first group concerns policy and prediction:

(a) How can the effects of information technologies on unsustainable behaviours be measured?

(b) How can the effects of harmful use of information technologies be predicted, or simulated?

…(f) Who is responsible for ensuring that design with the materials of technologies is directed towards sustainability?
His second category of questions concerns motivating sustainable behaviours by means of sustainable interaction design:

(a) How can digital artifice be designed such that people will prefer sustainable behaviours to unsustainable ones? …(c) How can renewal &amp; reuse of digital artifice be made to be more attractive than invention &amp; disposal in the view of interaction designers and in the public view?

==Computing and natural science==

A related driver for this work is the realisation that &quot;computation is everywhere&quot; (Denning, 2007), not least of which is the natural sciences.  Denning continues &quot;the old definition of computer science - the study of phenomena surrounding computers - is now obsolete. Computing is the study of natural and artificial information processes.&quot;  In his article, Denning quotes Ken Wilson, who describes computation as the third leg of science (joining the traditions of theory and experiment) and Nobel Laureate and Caltech President David Baltimore: &quot;Biology today is an information science&quot;.
Ecology in particular provides many examples of systems thinking, where the linkages between biological and environmental factors are explored in relation to human interventions.  Computing can be used to model these interactions; conversely computing systems can be modelled on the ecosystem, capitalising on similarities in language and patterns.  Odum (1996) states &quot;because ecology is an integrative science, it has tremendous potential to provide a communication bridge between science and society&quot;. 

==Metaphor in software engineering==

In software development the System Metaphor has been adopted as a core practice by the agile community. Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained defines a system metaphor as: 

''&quot;a story that everyone - customers, programmers, and managers - can tell about how the system works.&quot; p. 179.''
Wake and Wake (2002) argue that we seek a system metaphor for several reasons:

'''Common Vision:''' To enable everyone to agree on how the system works. The metaphor suggests the key structure of how the problem and the solution are perceived. This can make it easier to understand what the system is, as well as what it could be.

'''Shared Vocabulary:''' The metaphor helps to suggest a common system of names for objects and the relationships between them. This can become a jargon in the best sense: a powerful, specialized, shorthand vocabulary for experts. Naming something helps give you power over it.

'''Generativity:''' The analogies of a metaphor can suggest new ideas about the system (both problems and solutions). For example, the metaphor, &quot;Customer service is an assembly line&quot;. This suggests the idea of a problem being handed from group to group to be worked on, but it also raises the question, &quot;What happens when the problem gets to the end of the line - does it just fall off?&quot; This can bring out important issues that might otherwise lurk and fester.

'''Architecture:''' The metaphor shapes the system, by identifying key objects and suggesting aspects of their interfaces. It supports the static and dynamic object models of the system.

Some commonly used system metaphors are the spreadsheet, an assembly line, the shopping cart (used in e-commerce), a desktop or fridge door (information freely available, editable by all) and a library (information access and control systems).  
The need for an underlying principle can be seen in Don Gotterbarn\’s work on ethics (2002). His premise is quite simple - if you\’re going to build something, think about the impacts.  With Simon Rogerson he developed the concept of a Software Development Impact Statement (SoDIS) as a model which can be used to identify the ethical dimensions of a software development project and to identify ways to mediate the potential negative consequence of that project. The approach is developed from a distilling of 28 codes of ethics and is based around considering harm. When the approach was first developed it first considered harm caused by the computer, this was expanded to responsibility as a professional and now the questions are much broader.

What is the relationship between Don\’s ethics and sustainability?  We attempted to draw a Venn diagram and failed: is ethics the superset? is sustainability? are they largely overlapping sets? or are they the same thing through different lens?). Don\’s suggested approach to integrating sustainability is to include &quot;environment&quot; as a stakeholder. The structured questions &quot;Is there harm on the &lt;environment&gt;?&quot; would then prompt consideration of sustainability.  Unfortunately, this has limited success.  We found that this was too much of a blank piece of paper - our students just left it blank.  Don believes that this could be solved with more active prompting and questioning.  He gives examples of how he challenges students with consequences they hadn\’t thought of.  Unfortunately the rest of the world doesn\’t have Don in their classroom (or development team) facilitating discussion.  We also worry about the ability of computing professionals to identify unexpected consequences resulting from incremental and perhaps insidious change in fields increasingly remote from their core expertise.
Somehow we need a balance between a checklist and rules (which we know doesn\’t work) and a blank piece of paper with an instruction to \’use professional judgement\’. 

Don gives an example that is useful here.  He talks about a remote car starting device - a button to press as you approach your car so that it is ready to run by the time you get to it.  This would be a reasonably easy thing to program and to model.  In UML terms we would have an actor and a use case involving &quot;unlock&quot; to which we add &quot;start&quot;, a defined system boundary makes it easy to write code. How do we get the developer to think about the consequences of this? In places other than the US most cars are manual - remotely starting them is going to run someone over.

Is it simply a matter of having a bigger bounding box in UML - could we instigate a new symbol - the dotted world box?  How much bigger?   One option is the inbuilt redundancy used by engineering, but in software this is not always a good thing - particularly with regard to complexity of logic.  He says that the &quot;how do we know when we\’re done?&quot; question has long been the problem – how big a blank piece of paper are we giving people?  He sees the answer as a series of concentric rings with diminishing impact and that you work these rings until you reach &quot;the edge of your intellect&quot;.   This doesn\’t solve the problem of the student/developer who is happy with having reached the edge of their intellect/impact in the first ring.
The intention of the super-system metaphors we propose is to prompt people to think of their computing developments in terms of biological models then the sustainability impacts would be more obvious without it becoming a box ticking exercise.
Whitehead (2007) also stresses the importance of the metaphor in software engineering.  He argues that the &quot;collaborative work to create software artefacts is the collaborative work to create models of the software system&quot;.   The metaphor that underlies the model of collaboration is therefore critical to the outcome of software engineering.   When this metaphor is wrong, the outcomes can also be wrong, as Winschiers and Paterson (2004) describe for ICT developments in Namibia.  They argue that the whole paradigm of ICT transfer needs a rethink if ICT is to meet the needs of non-Western cultures.  

==Biomimicry as metaphor==

Biomimicry is described as:

''Biomimicry (from bios, meaning life, and mimesis, meaning to imitate) is a design discipline that studies nature\’s best ideas and then imitates these designs and processes to solve human problems. Studying a leaf to invent a better solar cell is an example of this &quot;innovation inspired by nature.&quot;''

''The core idea is that nature, imaginative by necessity, has already solved many of the problems we are grappling with. Animals, plants, and microbes are the consummate engineers. They have found what works, what is appropriate, and most important, what lasts here on Earth. This is the real news of biomimicry: After 3.8 billion years of research and development, failures are fossils, and what surrounds us is the secret to survival. (Biomimicry Institute, 2008)''

The link to sustainability is strong.  Biomimicry Guild argues that biomimicry design processes…

''Are sustainable: Biomimicry follows Life\’s Principles. Life\’s Principles instruct us to: build from the bottom up, self-assemble, optimize rather than maximize, use free energy, cross-pollinate, embrace diversity, adapt and evolve, use life-friendly materials and processes, engage in symbiotic relationships, and enhance the bio-sphere. By following the principles life uses, you can create products and processes that are well adapted to life on earth''. (Biomimicry Guild, 2008)

There is clearly much biologically inspired computing: genetic algorithms; neural networks; viruses and so on.  At a genetic level nature certainly stores information, and expresses this information. Further, nature has communication systems, and sometimes this forms complex information systems.   

The value of biomimicry has not gone unnoticed.  There is a Bio-inspired computing conference (Suda and Tschudin 2006) with sessions including bio-inspired security systems, networks, search algorithms, congestion control.  In ''Biomimicry for optimisation, control and automation'', Passino (2004) has an extensive chapter on foraging behaviours as a basis for search optimisation.  Vertegaal and Poupyrev (2008) recently edited a special edition of CACM on organic user interfaces:
''These three general directions together comprise what we refer to in this section as Organic User Interfaces: User interfaces with non-planar displays that may actively or passively change shape via analogue physical inputs. We chose the term &quot;organic&quot; not only because of the technologies that underpin some of the most important developments in this area, that is, organic electronics, but also because of the inspiration provided by millions of organic shapes that we can observe in nature, forms of amazing variety, forms that are often transformable and flexible, naturally adaptable and evolvable, while extremely resilient and reliable at the same time. We see the future of computing flourishing with thousands of shapes of computing devices that will be as scalable, flexible, and transformable as organic life itself. ''

Clearly, there are biological metaphors that could be used in software development.  The bigger question, is whether biomimicry itself could provide a metaphor to transform software development? – a super metaphor?
Almost all software development follows an engineering based project management paradigm. The underlying model is one of business, only very occasionally does science get a look in with scientific method sneaking in only in the form of test based development.

The development methodology described by Biomimicry Guild can be seen to closely align with the software development processes (see, for example, the Agile Development Framework, Mann and Smith 2006).

We\’ve already seen that there could be benefits in biological metaphors. These could be facilitated with questions such as &quot;How does Nature achieve this function in this environment?&quot; Find champion adapters by asking &quot;whose survival depends on this?&quot;.

Thompson (2008) argues that:
''The team is in itself a super-organism and as such it needs to be treated in ways that enhance and support its complex and interconnected nature. If you can see the team as a whole and not as the mere aggregation of the individual parts that make it up, you can discover how much more productive, reliable and efficient a virtual team can be. ''

==Ecosystem as metaphor==
In ''Sustainable Software Development: An Agile Perspective'' Tate (2006) dismisses building construction as a metaphor for software development as building projects are largely static and have a clear finishing point.  Instead he uses a coral reef metaphor for the software development industry since, like a coral reef, successful software &quot;inhabits a complex and continually evolving ecosystem…&quot; and &quot;the development team needs to interact with and foster its ecosystem.&quot;
''A successful software product plays the role of the underlying coral in the reef. The coral is what makes the entire ecosystem possible. None of the other organisms can survive without it. …continually evolving, growing, and changing. The reef is incredibly complex yet also fragile and vulnerable, just as a software product\’s ecosystem is prone to disruptive technologies or competition. This level of complexity, growth, constant change, evolution, and vulnerability I believe accurately portrays the complex world that today\’s software products inhabit.''

While many Agile references to sustainability derive from a goal of maintaining work pace (through small teams and 40 hour weeks) and long term survival, nevertheless the notion of being aware of the environment in which the industry exists, and the need to nurture that environment, are apparent. By definition, lean methodologies are easier on people, use fewer resources and consider the needs of the stakeholders at every stage of the development and beyond (Boehm, 2004).

Tate describes sustainable development as a pace that can be maintained indefinitely but &quot;this does not mean slower development - quite the opposite&quot;, nor a lessening of rigour:

''Sustainable development requires a singular focus on a form of technical excellence that regularly provides useful software to customers while keeping the cost of change low….(and be) …able to deal with change, not be afraid of it or view it as a risk''

Tate describes a mindset that the team is in it for the long haul as underlying sustainable development. The team adopts and fosters principles and practices that help them continually increase their efficiency, so that as the project gets larger and more complex and customer demands increase, the team can continue at the same pace while keeping quality high and sanity intact.  They do this by continually minimising complexity, revisiting their plans, and paying attention to the health of their software and its ability to support change.  The key points include a working product at all times;  fix then code (not code then fix);  test driven development and so on. These are all worthy goals, but this approach is clearly not informed by Blevis\’ lens of sustainability.  It does not describe a culture that is considers the full scope of sustainability (An appreciation of importance of environmental, social, political and economic contexts…etc).  One suspects though, that a workplace coming to grips with the ecosystem metaphor and following Tate\’s advice would be more likely to see the bigger picture. 

The original title for Highsmith\’s (2002) Agile Software Development ''Ecosystems'' was Agile Software Development ''Methodologies''.  But, as Highsmith explains, it was changed &quot;because (methodologies) didn\’t fit with the focal points of Agile development – people, relationships, and uncertainty&quot;.   Ecosystem was used to &quot;describe a holistic environment that includes three interwoven components  - a &quot;chaordic\’ perspective, collaboration values and principles, and a barely sufficient methodology&quot;

Highsmith argues that the word ecosystem &quot;conjures visions of living things and their interactions with each other&quot;, is &quot;thought of as dynamic, ever changing environment in which people and organisations constantly initiate actions and respond to each other\’s actions&quot; and &quot;focuses us on the dynamic interactions of individuals and teams rather than on the static lines on organisation charts&quot;.  Unfortunately, this is the last mention of what we might consider a sustainability or biologically inspired use of ecosystem throughout Highsmith. 

In January 2008, Computerworld reported IDC\’s annual top ten predictions for the NZ computing industry.  Number one is the impact of the skills crisis in NZ computing slowing investment. Number five is: 

''Green IT - issues behind the hype will shine through''

What interests us most though is their repeated use of the term &quot;ecosystem&quot;:

''3. Emergence of the software as a service ecosystem - proposition will convert into penetration''

and

''7. Will the future of the channel ecosystem be revolution or evolution?''

This use of &quot;ecosystem&quot; is perhaps unfortunate.  It is not an indicator of a greater understanding through a biological metaphor.   They are not alone in this.  For example, Benkler\’s (2001) &quot;series of technological shocks to the economic and technological ecosystem within which information is produced&quot; demonstrates use of the word with no biological underpinnings at all.    

Others demonstrate a greater understanding.   Trimeche ''et al.'' (2005) describe end user experience in a multi-device ecosystem, meaning just ''system'' (although their system includes social context, spatio-temporal context).  Similarly, Lentz and Bleizeffer (2007) use IT ecosystems to infer complexity (and synonymously with ''environment'') but they do discuss evolving technologies and integrated software and hardware interactions with associated human systems.   
In the context of multimedia semantics, Scherp and Jain (2007) used ecosystem to be mean ''framework''.  Their Semantics Ecosystem is based on the relationships between physical world and mental model (plus products of the mind).  This model has flows in both directions: analysis and synthesis.  They do though include concepts borrowed from systems, particularly notions of feedback and emergent semantics.

David Messerschmitt and Clemens Szypersk\’s (2003) book Software Ecosystem renamed the software ''industry'' the software ''ecosystem'' and examined the complexities of our business in terms of larger systems.  Unfortunately, Messerschmitt and Szypersk don\’t go far beyond the emphasis on the interconnectedness of a variety of issues surrounding software development.

In the preface Messerschmitt and Szypersk argue:

''The software industry is itself very complex, with many complimentary products necessary to for a systems solution and complex alliances and standardisation processes needed to meet the needs of numerous stakeholders. Together, the software suppliers, standardisation bodies, content suppliers, service suppliers, and end-user organisations form a complex web of relationships. The &quot;ecosystem&quot; metaphor is truly descriptive. ''

''The overarching theme of the book is that software is different. ''

Remember the benefits of a metaphor – common vision, a shared vocabulary, architecture and generativity.  All of these, especially the last, benefit most from actually using the metaphor - borrowing from the idea to create new understandings.  It is pointless to have a metaphor and then ignore it. Messerschmitt and Szypersk do recognise the value of cross disciplinary thought:

''it is interesting to compare software to other industries, looking for parallels that might offer insights to the software industry''

and

''some insights and perspectives on software from the economics profession are described in chapter 9.''

Nowhere though, do Messerschmitt and Szypersk actually use the ecosystem metaphor. And they are missing so many opportunities.  They do take something like a systems approach - they look for simple laws to describe flows of information and then try to consider these in larger systems. On page 34, for example, they examine Moore\’s law and how it might operate over different scales.

''Since previous technologies (like transportation or electrification) did not advance according to Moore\’s law, there must be something distinctive about the material information technologies''

It is a shame that a whole field of environmental science is ignored: landscape ecology. It has much to say about scaling effects. Missed opportunities for new understandings continue:

* there is discussion about heterogeneity without reference to biodiversity;

* specialization and change without evolution;

* networks with out food webs;

* value chains without food chains;

* productivity without photosynthesis;

* models of development and maturity without succession;

* community without community;

* competition without competition;

* change without disturbance;

* components without demography;

* cooperation without relationships;

* interfaces without edge effects;

In addition to missed opportunities, things seem awry from an ecosystem perspective. &quot;Environments&quot; are described that in the various chapters that stop at the boundaries of that chapter (users, hardware or network).  A model of the internet is provided where the heterogeneous internet consists of separated (but communicating) homogeneous environments. Other factors crucial to ecosystems are missing entirely: stochastic events, feedback, limiting factors.

Messerschmitt and Szypersk perceptively state:

''The daily operation of most software systems requires human intervention ''
''…these functions are called system administration. ''

Again, we could be so much further ahead if they then went on to borrow from the field of human ecosystems.  Instead they have a chapter (9) on economics. There, the abstract discussions on supply, risk, complementarity, competitive advantage, time, and re-use are all crying out for some actual consideration of ecosystems.
Fortunately, other authors are further along this continuum.  Hsi (2004) captures a computing ecosystem framework, using niche as &quot;conceptual fitness&quot;.  

''In biology, ecosystems describe a defined envelope of physical, chemical, and biological processes within a space and time.  More generally, an ecosystem is &quot;a system of interacting species in a particular environment&quot;.  We define a computing ecosystem as a set of use contexts that use computing to fulfil goals, contained within an environment of interest.  A computing ecosystem can be a single person and a handheld PDA or a multi-national company of database management specialists.  In a computing ecosystem, the organisms are the computing functions that users apply towards achieving their goals.''
But then they seemingly abandon the metaphor and perform an analysis based on morphology, ontological excavation (from graph theory) and Use Case mapping. 

Chilley (a panellist in Fraser ''et al.'' (2005) discussion on software robustness) describes how

''Inherently complex, this new world is also more problematic than previously. Whereas traditional end to end systems can be likened to chains, linear systems where the weakest link will constrain the overall strength of the whole, the emerging service-driven systems are non linear, more likely to change their links and associations over time, changing their configuration to suit the demands of the moment. The structure of the underlying information ecosystem and the various cyber terrains it inhabits is also evolving and becoming more opaque.''

In the same panel Gabriel (2005) described systems that are called such systems autopoietic or self-creating. 

''We can note that the theory and practice of software as it exists and as it is taught is antithetical to this notion (current software is allopoietic or other creating—it is the manufacturing model). Therefore, I would claim that though it is possible to make some software systems robust (for a while) using current languages and techniques, we can never fully succeed by proceeding this way. Our languages and techniques—design, implementation, methodologies, etc—are inflexible (by design), having been created to be consistent with / mimic simplistic mathematical models.  As long as we use arithmetic and crude cartons as the basis for all programming, we will move only slowly toward robustness.''

''A better approach is to compartmentalize (modularize / encapsulate / spatially compartmentalize) those parts of our software that do things like computing away from those parts that constitute its living architecture—&quot;living&quot; in the perhaps literal sense, but definitely not &quot;living&quot; in any sense related to how we compute today.  And this latter type of software—the living part—will not be produced (or manufactured) in the same ways as the former, nor in the same sorts of languages. ''

McCormack (2007) describes the abstraction of natural ecosystem processes.  Real ecosystems are highly complex and diverse 
systems, so we need to be careful about the processes we wish to mimic and how well suited (or otherwise) they are to the goal.  

McCormack\’s examples are in creative discovery: artworks: eg Eden:  This work consists of a complex artificial ecosystem 
running in real-time on a two-dimensional lattice of cells.  The ecosystem consists of three basic types of matter: rocks, biomass, and evolving agents. If a rock occupies a cell, agents or biomass may not.  Agents attempting to move into a cell occupied by a rock will \’feel\’ pain and suffer energy loss.
Briscoe and De Wilde (2006) also explicitly use an ecosystem metaphor.  They describe a business optimisation technique &quot;inspired by natural ecosystems&quot;: a &quot;digital ecosystem model&quot;. They illustrate this with figures that would not be out of place in Odum (1996). (Figure 1).

{|
|'' …in the Digital Ecosystem there will be multiple evolving populations in response to similar requests. This is shown in Figure 4 where the shades of the evolving populations indicates similarity in the requests being managed. For example, the four habitats in the top left  may all be travel agents, the three with evolving populations may be looking for package holidays within the same continent. A great holiday package (services) found and used in one habitat, will then be migrated to the other connected habitats… where it will be integrated into any currently active evolving populations''
Figure 1: Ecosystem image and text from Briscoe and De Wilde (2006)

Scacchi (2007) uses the ecosystem metaphor on a different level in an analysis of Free and Open Source development.  There, recognising that the &quot;growth patterns (of FOSS) seem to challenge the well established laws of software evolution&quot;, they suggest ecological thinking as the basis for further research: 

''&quot;Persistent self-sustaining organisation or project community…Coevolution of interdependent software systems and standards for interoperation within an FOSS ecosystem represents an opportunity for research that investigates understanding such a software evolution process through studies supported by modelling and simulation techniques&quot;.''

==Conclusion==

Blevis argues that we should use natural models and reflection as an underlying principle in interaction design.  In this paper we have examined whether we could adopt biomimicry in software engineering.  By doing so we might hope to work more sustainably and produce more sustainable products.

While biomimicry and bio-inspiration has been successful in specific areas of computing, we are yet to see a successful application at a paradigm level. 

Instead, we have observed repeated use of terms such as ecosystem without any benefit the metaphor might have otherwise afforded.  This approach entirely ignores ecological science; it does not even vaguely approach sustainability.
So, with the term software ecosystem suddenly gaining prominence along with the recognition of green computing, we suspect people are putting two and two together and getting five. Feel free to use the word, we are not word-use Luddites (despite ecosystem being explicitly coined for the ecological sciences), but please don\’t think that by putting ecosystem behind everything means you are acting sustainably. The term greenwash comes to mind.

A final word of caution.  Despite the use of inherently natural models, and the strong links to sustainability given above, biological metaphors taken out of context may not be at all sustainable. Nature is not always a benign operation; much of what we see in nature is a result of fierce battles in the competition for scarce resources – primarily light. A whole systems approach would be crucial in such a paradigm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Computers define and control many aspects of our lives.  From banking systems to air traffic control, food production to medical care, we are continuously exposed to technological systems which potentially track our behaviour, invade our privacy and put our safety at risk.  How then, to ensure that ethical concerns are taken into account? A litigious society ensures (most of the time) that human lives are not at risk from faulty products, but can we also be sure that software meets the needs of the disabled community, or that the ecological impact is minimised?

==Sociotechnical computing==

Developers naturally focus on getting the technical components of a system correct.  Is the system effective, is it robust, is there sufficient bandwidth to meet the client’s requirements?  However the software may be used in ways never intended by the developers and assumptions made during the development process can have a critical impact on outcomes. For example, in industrial settings, users sometimes disable electronic safety systems in order to increase outputs, possibly at the cost of fingers or limbs.  

Computing systems are tools that are increasingly embedded and invisible to the end user. Computer errors, whether intentional or accidental, can affect educational outcomes, financial records, alter personal data or determine elections,  This potentially creates a power imbalance as computer ‘experts’ have the ability to manipulate systems to their own advantage.

In addition, software systems do not function in isolation.  They are designed and used by humans, who bring their own values and biases to the process.  It is important to take these factors into consideration when designing software, by using thoughtful value choices and being aware of the choices we are making.


==Example==

The Therac-25 was a computer controlled medical linear accelerator used for treating cancer.  Many of these machines were in use in the United States during the 1980’s.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25 for details.


==Code of ethics==

For software engineers, ethical practice has two dimensions:

1. Technical Ethics 

Doing a technically competent job at all phases of the software development process

2. Professional Ethics

Using a set of moral values to guide the technical decisions

Software engineering has grown from its computer engineering roots into a recognised professional discipline.  The development of a code of ethics was an important step in this process, and the Software Engineering Code of Ethics was adopted by the IEEE Computer Society and the ACM in 1999.

The code, developed through extensive consultation within the software engineering  industry,  “documents the 
 ethical and professional obligations of software engineers.” (Gotterbarn, Miller, Rogerson, 1999) and provides normative guidelines rather than taking a regulatory approach.


In brief, the code suggests that software engineers should

* consider who is affected by their work 
* examine if they and their colleagues are treating other human beings with due respect; 
* consider how the public, if reasonably well informed, would view their decisions; 
* analyze how the least empowered will be affected by their decisions;
* consider whether their acts would be judged worthy of the ideal professional working as a software engineer.

==Stakeholders==

A critical aspect of any ethical analysis is to identify the stakeholders who may be affected by the use of the system under development.
  
What is a stakeholder?  Traditional definitions from the corporate world usually assume a financial stakeholding in a project.  This narrow focus would usually only include the client who has commissioned the software system. 
 
Williamson (2003) defines four levels of stakeholder:

1. Direct - People or groups who directly interact with the project (eg, end users, operators).

2. Indirect - People or groups who do not directly interact with the project, but exercise strong influence over direct 
users (eg, employers, supervisors). 

3. Remote - People or groups who remain at a distance from the project, but could be affected/influenced by the    project (eg, patients, clients).

4. Societal - Wider social influences.  This might include government or regulatory agencies who have an interest in the organisation where the software is used.

This broader view ensures that we consider the ‘downstream’ effects of the system being developed. For an ethical analysis there is a need to check for issues at every stage of development, with every stakeholder and from every perspective. 

Williamson uses a &quot;audience map&quot; to help identify the stakeholders. 

[[Image:Audiencemap.jpg |400px]]

{{Adfexemplar |Living Campus | Software Engineering 2008 | 

The audience map was used by groups to identify stakeholders of the Living Campus project.  These stakeholders were then used in the SoDIS process that followed.

[[Image:Elc_audiencemap1.JPG |400px]]

}}






==Sodis==
SoDIS (Software Development Impact Statement) is a system which uses a stakeholder impact analysis to identify, evaluate and mitigate risks in the software development process.  Through this process the developer is encouraged to consider of people, groups or organisations and how they are related to the proposed project and its products or deliverables.

This tool is designed to identify risks in a software engineering project through a rigorous analysis of the impact on stakeholders of the development and use of the final product.  It primarily addresses ethical issues but in the process wider concerns are often identified.  It can be used at any stage of the SDLC as a review exercise, but would generally be applied in the early planning stages.

The SoDIS Project Auditor is a software package that uses SoDIS to facilitate the process of auditing projects for risks.



We are using SoDIS during the first iteration of the Design Concept.  In this way we can identify potential design issues with the system before any significant design decisions are made.  Later we will do an in depth Sodis analysis, which will highlight risks associated with the use of the system in place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">DM81LS95A • DM81LS96A • DM81LS97A
3-STATE Octal Buffer


General Description
These devices provide eight, two-input buffers in each package. All employ low-power-Schottky TTL technology.One of the two inputs to each buffer is used as a control line to gate the output into the high-impedance state, while the other input passes the data through the buffer. The DM81LS95A and DM81LS97A present true data at the out-puts, while the DM81LS96A is inverting. On the
DM81LS95A and DM81LS96A versions, all eight 3-STATE enable lines are common, with access through a 2-input NOR gate. On the DM81LS97A version, four buffers are enabled from one common line, and the other four buffers are enabled form another common line. In all cases the
outputs are placed in the 3-STATE condition by applying a high logic level to the enable pins.


Features :

Typical power dissipation 

DM81LS95A, 

DM81LS97A 80 mW 

DM81LS96A 65 mW 

Typical propagation delay

Design specification is about taking the seemingly vague ideas from the interaction design and refining these into detailed blueprints that can be given to programmers. 

In the second iteration of the Agile Development Framework the design specifications are the detailed instructions that we can give the programmers (recognising that in many cases this is really us wearing a different hat). In the second iteration we’ll be working towards the first “Functional Delivery’ and will be developing detailed screen interface layouts, data structures and system diagrams and so on. Similarly, in the 3rd iteration, where the outcome is the “Robust Delivery”, we’ll have all of that, plus detailed testing specifications.

So, what do we do in this first iteration? Remember that the purpose of the first iteration is to generate a flow of information in the  team (including the client) and to increase understanding about the problem area we’re working in. The implementation we’re about to do is about building a prototype to help us achieve those things.   A prototype, by definition, has a clearly defined purpose: we do it to answer specific questions (rather than a failed first attempt).

This prototype has two main purposes:

1.	a quick implementation to use as a model for talking with the client and for users “if we build something like this is it what you had in mind?” , “ if we were to build something like this, would it meet your business requirements (/opportunity)?”  Note we need to make sure that this defines the problem, and is not attempting to describe a solution. 

Here's the analogy: for a project described as 'make me a way of moving a family 400 miles', a prototype might resemble a go-kart.  If the client then says 'oh no, did I forget to mention it has to float?' then we saved a potentially embarrassing miscommunication. 

2.	a chance for the group to get their hands dirty.  This is especially important for student projects for two reasons - first it is a chance for the group to see how it operates (is the group member who describes himself as a ‘gun programmer’ dreaming or a real asset to the group?); secondly it gives the team a chance to experience some of the methods and tools that they might meet when they do the 2nd and 3rd iterations – we would rather find out now that something is going to be particularly tricky to implement than when a delivery deadline is looming.  In the go-kart story from just above - now is the time to discover that no one in the group has any welding experience!

So, in this design specification sector we are taking everything we know already and recasting it in terms of what we need to know for the first implementation, or perhaps more correctly; in questions that the first implementation can be designed to answer.  We do this by creating a “knowledge base”. '''This “knowledge base” gives us a snapshot of where are and what we know (and what we don’t know) about the project'''. By going through the project in a structured way, we should already be able to generate a great deal of statements about the project.  Some of these we’ll know with a high degree of certainty, some we’ll have a fair idea of, others still we’ll have to make up.   This might be a good time to recap a couple of the agile values: courage and honesty.

The questions we ask are all things that we need to know eventually, if not now. The courage value comes in here with recognition that this is your project, no fairy godmother is going to appear with all the answers. Who writes the functional requirements? You do. Who writes the acceptance tests? You do. Who writes the User Manual? You do. (I could play this game all night but you get the picture).  The honesty value comes in recognising the certainty and importance we ascribe to each of these statements. 

So, you should undertake an exercise to write down everything you know (or don’t know) about the project.  Each of these statements should be examined to see how much certainty you can associate with each one.  Then, how important they are.   A matrix of these measures gives us a steer as to what we should be doing next.

== Questions ==

{{XExample|This list of questions is intended to prompt you to think about all aspects of the project.}} 

Write answers as stand-alone statements rather than answers to questions.   
Don’t be afraid to write other statements that are directly prompted by these questions.  

Each question may generate more than one statement

Who is the client?

What is their business?  (/what is their mission statement)

What are their key performance indicators?

What is their problem (or business opportunity)?

How did they come to have this business problem/opportunity?

At a high level: how will the project success be measured? (from the client’s point of view/ from yours...)

If the client had unlimited resources, how would you solve the problem?

If the client had already made the decision to employ a person to solve the problem (so your job is to work out that persons 
job description) what would that person do ?

What group processes have you put  in place (to ensure smooth communication, to resolve differences, to facilitate creativity, 
to facilitate quality of work...)

Complete the following: “Our evidence portfolio is ... “

Complete the following: “Our Scrum meetings are ... “

What is an appropriate system metaphor for the project?

What is the nature of the benefit to the client? (Involvement in the process; product to sell; enabling  new markets; improved 
business practice etc).

What factors will constrain the development of your project?

What is the current practice?  (what do the people do?,  what are the paper systems? what are the computer systems?)

What are the functional requirements? (“The user will ... “)

What are the system requirements for the system?

Who are the users (/what are their characteristics?)

Who are the stakeholders (/what is their relationship with the system, what will they like/dislike about the system)?

If you had unlimited resources, what would you do to solve the problem?

If the instruction was that the problem was not to be solved with computers, what would you do?

The users will really like  ________ about this system

The users will really dislike  ________ about this system

Has this been done before?  Have separate parts been done before?

What are the options on how to acquire it? 

What are the costs (not just financial) of this system?

What are the benefits of this system?

Explain the system in ROI (Return on Investment) terms

How would you explain the problem/opportunity to a journalist?

Are there intellectual property issues with this project (infringing on others, or potential for commercialisation)

Draw a system sketch

== What next? ==

We take the highest ranking statements (least certain and most important) and use them to drive the prototype implementation.  

Some questions will not need an elaborate prototype.   Others will need answering even before you embark on a prototype.  Key questions here are: has his problem been solved before? , what is available off the shelf?, what components could we incorporate?

For student projects a valid question is &quot;do we have the capability?&quot;.  Hence, a useful first iteration prototype might be &quot;hello world&quot; in the likely implementation platform. 

On presentation of their project to an external industry panel one group got the response 
“while we don’t mind if you reinvent the wheel, you should know that you have and make it better, instead, you have reinvented the  wheel without reference to the round wheel, and given us a square wheel”.  

[[Image:Sqaurewheel.jpg |400px]]

For example: For a project to develop an “intelligent” robot head for a museum...

== Taking it further ==


The knowledge base could be used as a driver for the whole project.   If you were to write the knowledge base on a white board or series of cards (and continually updating it via the Scrum meetings), choosing a task for each day could be as simple as taking the top most ranking statement (most important/least certain) and working to answer it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview Iteration Two ==

The second iteration is the heart of the development process.  In it we progress from having a high level understanding of the business problem/opportunity to having a system deployed in active use by users. 

In the first iteration we have: 

- established a development team

- established firm communication links with the client

- established that we are on common ground with the client about the high level need for the project

- established a methodology and work practices.

In the second iteration we progress through a development cycle.  We first work out in some detail what needs to be done, work out how to do it, and (you guessed it)  do it.  We finish this iteration with a deployed system that functions and is useful.  Exactly what that system does (and what gets left until the third iteration) we’ll come back to.  For the moment, it is important that we know that the date of delivery is the most important variable.  This is called a '''timebox''', which means that we adjust what we are trying to do to fit the time and resources available.  

Remember that the internals of each of these sectors is not explicitly defined.  What is more important is the flow of information as we massage and enhance our understandings as we move to the output of that sector. We should, though, always be able to explain why we are doing something, and demonstrate how it helps us towards the goal. 

Although the focus here is on structured processes, we undertake them according to agile principles.  We expect that scrum meetings are the basis for each day’s work, that there is a focus on quality and simplest thing that could possibly work, and that the emphasis remains on outcomes rather than processes for the sake of it.   Always keep a metaphorical eye on the rainbow for that sector to a) check that all workstreams are covered, and b) know how what you are doing directly feeds the outcome of that sector. We should include the client as much as possible through the process and will be sending formal documentation at the end of each sector (sometimes a detailed proposal, sometimes an update letter). 

The evaluation sector is the transition between iterations.  In it, we look back at what we have done so far and plan the next sectors.  This is an important phase in formalising our interaction with the client by means of a proposal.   


== Functional Requirements ==

The Functional Requirements sector can be summarised in one word: “what”.  Here we work out what the system needs to do (as opposed to how to do it).  

The functional requirements are instructions describing what functions the software is supposed to provide, what characteristics the software is supposed to have, and what goals the software is supposed to meet or to enable users to meet.  
Functional requirement statements begin with “The system shall...”.  (Note: there are some moves to replace this with user stories “The user shall...”).  They are usually accompanied by system requirements: “The system shall have....”.

To get to these functional requirements we go through a process of collecting and understanding as much information as we can.  Very quickly we have to understand every detail of the organisation we’re working with.  From the first interview we have to be knowledgeable about the business.  Fortunately we have some techniques to help collect and structure this information, working from both above and below the problem.  We use functional decomposition to help us understand the business workflow, data modelling to identify structures and relationships and logic structuring to capture business rules.  We also observe and question users.  

These techniques will lead us directly to directly to functional requirements that define what the system has to do.  We test these functional requirements to make sure that they address the business opportunity and  are feasible to develop (though we have to be careful not to restrict our thinking).  These requirements become the basis for our development and are fed onto the next sector.


== Interaction Design ==

In Interaction Design we develop the look and feel of a system that meets the functional requirements. Although we mostly think about interfaces being computer screens, most projects have other non-screen interface elements, for example forms, reports and sometime s physical interactivity systems.

The output of this sector is a design proposal that we will formally present to the client.  The client and users should be closely involved in this sector. 

This is the most fun and creative stage of the whole development process, but it is also a sector that requires much rigour and care.  All five workstreams are likely to be running simultaneously and you should expect to have several balls in the air at the same time.

Four tricks this time:

- Test everything: users don’t behave or think the way you do

- Don’t cheat: building an interface in your favorite IDE and then working backwards through process doesn’t work.  Do not skimp on the dialogue diagrams.

- Users should forget they are using your system: the measure of success is primarily in match to the users’ model of how something should be done, and people like things simple so you should be as elegant as possible: a few well designed interfaces are far preferable to a multitude of hotchpotch.

- Go around again.  This sector is hard work but is the most satisfying of all.  If something doesn’t work, keep trying and if it does work, test it until you break it. It is far easier to get it right here than when you’ve spent ages coding it.  And remember, for the users, the interface IS the system, all the other stuff is just mechanics - this has to be right.

The flow here is directly from functional requirements that we turn into tasks performed by the users (whom we consider in some detail).  These tasks we develop into diagrams that represent the best possible way of achieving those tasks.  Then we think of all the possible things that can go wrong and make sure that our system can support this.  While we are doing this, we have one eye on developing a logical data model that supports the information we are working with.
At the same time as are doing this we work on developing design themes. Starting with the metaphor, we come up with some alternatives about what the system will look like.  This means the style of look, but perhaps more importantly, the style of interactivity.  

Then comes the most important bit: taking the theme, the dialogue diagrams and the logical data model and converting these to a wireframe interface.  This interface we test as a paper based prototype with the actual user.  Expect here to realise you’ve gotten something completely wrong and go back to the dialogue diagram, the design theme, the tasks or even the functional requirements.  It is important to recognise the iterative nature of this stage, revising past decisions, adding or changing functional requirements is part of the development process.

We present the results of this development and testing in Interaction Design presentation/document to the client.

== Design Specifications ==

In the design specifications we put the detail on the Interaction Design. 

By the end of this sector we have a blueprint to give to programmers.  They should be able to build exactly what we specify.  
The design specification integrates both the look and the how.  We take the design theme and wireframe and develop detailed interface specifications and complete designed products such as the user manual.  Alongside this we continue to develop the database (the key here is ‘no magic’ - all data come from and goes to somewhere).  The physical data model is a detailed specification of the information to be stored and manipulated by our system.  

Alongside the ‘how’ of the interfaces we also work out the how of the back end.  This starts with the database and system architecture (expressed in a diagram), then decisions about coding structures  and ends with development and testing of a stable development platform.

The stable development platform is the framework upon which your system is to be built.  For example, for a database with a web front end we would expect you to demonstrate connectivity and basic database functions via the web (insert, delete, query, update) plus any standard infrastructure (login etc).


== Implementation ==

The implementation stage is about building a system according to the specifications.  This is where you get the pay back for all the hard work you’ve done so far. Building upon the  stable platform, with a physical database designed and tested, and with detailed interface specifications, this implementation shouldn’t be an enormous task.  Fortunately, software engineering also facilitates the implementation sector.  We use several tools from Extreme Programming (XP) to help us.  
We use modular and pattern based development, we use paired programming, and we use test based development.  We test extensively and then we test some more.  We carefully think out the best way of deploying the system and we do it.  While this is happening we train the users. 

At the end of this sector we have deployed a system that works and, importantly is in active use by the users.  


== Evaluation ==

Once the system has been in use for a while we need to take time to do an evaluation.   This is more than just a “does it work?” (although that is important too, but also includes a hard look at the functional requirements (were they right?, are there any missing?, and so on) and a reflective look at all aspects of the development.  The client should be closely involved in this reflective process.

== Requirements and the Planning Game ==

The goal of software engineering is to deliver software that does what it is supposed to do, on time and under budget.  As we have learned, traditional plan driven methodologies have consistently failed to achieve this.  One key factor has been the strategies for the elicitation of requirements.  Plan driven waterfall methodologies determine requirements thoroughly at an early stage, then use these requirements to guide the remainder of the process.  The problem is: what happens when the requirements change?  This might happen when the business itself changes, or different users consider the software and suggest alternative applications, or the client gains a better understanding of the possibilities of the software.


== What is a requirement? ==
• 
A requirement is a statement identifying a capability, physical characteristic, or quality factor that defines a product or process need for which a solution will be pursued.

	Functional requirements describe what the system does (capabilities).

Eg, “The system shall enroll students in courses”

	Non-functional requirements describe what the system has (physical characteristics).
Includes reliability, quality, safety, maintainability.


== Language ==

One of the challenges in the discussion between the customer and the developers is the language used.  The customer is an expert in his business domain, and will use language appropriate to that domain. For example an accountant will use terms such as ‘return on investment’ (ROI) or ‘net present value’ (NPV).  In the education domain, phrases such as ‘path of study’ (POS) or ‘equivalent full time student’ (EFTS) are part of the familiar vocabulary.  The developers meanwhile, are familiar with technical terms and can easily confuse the customer with this jargon.  


== The Agile Approach ==

Agile methods use an approach to determining requirements that can be described as “just in time” requirements analysis. Meetings are held with the customer and/or users in which a best guess is made of what the requirements might be, given the current understanding of the problem.  The language used must be understandable to both customer and developer, as the process is the beginning of an ongoing conversation which will continue throughout the development.

Kent Beck, in Extreme Programming (2005) describes a formal requirements gathering process called “The Planning Game”.  This is one of the defined Extreme Programming practices.  Remember that the key values in Extreme programming are: 

	Communication
	Simplicity
	Feedback
	Courage
	Respect

The Planning Game applies these values by encouraging early, effective discussion with the whole development team, including the customers.  User stories are captured onto index cards and displayed for the whole team to discuss.  They are then used to plan the development, including releases and estimation of time.  Team members prioritise the cards, discuss constraints and describe tests for the completion of the stories.  
Mike Cohn (2004) has developed Beck’s ideas with his application of user stories to agile development.  


== What is a user story? ==

“A user story describes a functionality that will be valuable to either a user of purchaser of a system or software.” (p4, Cohn, 2004)

The story describes something that the user will do in a single session, for example,
“The student will access a project file”, “The student group will have concurrent access to the project files”.

The user stories include three components:

1.	The story itself

2.	Comments which may clarify details of the story, or raise a point for later discussion

3.	Tests to indicating the completion of the story

Jeffries (2001) describes the process of composing the user stories as “Card, Conversation and Confirmation”.  The cards are used to capture the initial requirements, which are then discussed among the team and then implemented and tested.  This emphasises the stories’ role as a communication tool, to be used in the development process.  They are not used to document the process and are not a contractual obligation.  Traditional requirements documents were both of these things.

Using this approach allows the team to spread the decision making across the duration of the project.  Big picture decisions can be made early, which allows initial planning.  Details can be added later as required.  Early, large stories are known as ‘epics’.  

How big is a story?

Ideally, it describes a task that will require ½ - 10 days coding, assuming an experienced development team.  Learning to estimate the size of a story is an important skill for developers.  Planning which stories will be included in each iteration is dependent on good time estimations.

Why use story cards?

	They emphasise verbal rather than written communication

	They are understandable by all team members

	They assist effective planning

	They enable iterative development

	They encourage deferring detail 
(Cohn, 2004)


A good story is:
• Independent
• Negotiable
• Valuable to users or customers
• Estimatable
• Small
• Testable

(Wake, 2003a)


{{Adfexemplar | Shac09 | Software Engineering 2007 |

By thinking about various system metaphors, the class was able to write a large number of stories about people involved in the metaphors (eg Judicial system - &quot;The lawyer applies for a mistrial&quot;).  These were easily translated to the real system - an information system to support a sustainable house building competition.  These user stories were then sorted and ranked via the planning game.

== What is a metaphor? ==

In the first iteration, the functional requirements sector involves us having discussions about our approach to the business problem or opportunity.  We do this by means of a system metaphor.  

A metaphor is a comparison between two seemingly unrelated subjects.  They are used in language to enliven, to encourage interpretation and to provide a vehicle for understanding when either there are no direct terms for a concept or other explanataion is cumbersome.  By understanding and experiencing one thing in terms of another we can provide a means of exploring a concept even before we’ve really come to terms with what it is we’re talking about. 

Perhaps the most famous metaphor is Shakespeare’s opening: 

{{cquote|All the world’s a stage 
And all the men and women merely players 

They have their exits and their entrances || (William Shakespeare|  As You Like It 2/7 }}

In ordinary conversation we speak of “pulling your socks up”, “drowning in paper”, “unfolding the road map to peace” and “my memory is a little foggy”.   The metaphor we use for something can be quite informative.  For example, the words we use for business are often based on a war metaphor: “hostile takeover”,  “losing ground”,  and so on, and these in turn affect the management of the business.  Ray Jackson (quoted in CEO Forum) uses lessons from the military in a discussion of business practices:

''I think it taught me that the world is always imperfect, and that your knowledge base is also imperfect. In military operations, you never really have ‘all the facts’, in the literal sense. So it teaches you to operate on incomplete data: take the data you have, turn it into information, and figure out what you need to do. I guess I learnt that clarity is better than certainty: there comes a time when you have enough information to move on. If you wait for certainty it never arrives. The military makes you comfortable with uncertainty.''

''The other thing I learnt was the need to not procrastinate in making decisions, and to be incisive. You learn a process of continually making decisions, then reviewing those decisions as more information comes to light. This has been very useful in business.''

''The military also teaches you to carefully manage resources. On a naval mission, for instance, you only have a limited amount of fuel, a limited amount of ammunition, and so on. Your most important limited resource, of course, is your people, so you need to look after and nurture them - you can’t work them to death! The military teaches you to always be very mindful of your resources and how you can best use and conserve them.''

''I also think you learn a lot about leadership and communication. I like the expression ‘People don’t want to be continually inspired, they just want to know what they should do’.
''
''Most military people have a highly competitive, ‘we are here to win’ streak, so that toughness and commitment is there. Some aspects of business are like a battle, so those types of attitudes can be useful.''
''
Another useful attitude is to set your goals, and then be steadfast in pursuing them come what may. The goals of war and business are different, of course. War is about defeating an enemy - it’s a zero sum game. In business, on the other hand, your objective may be to be the most profitable company. It’s not a goal that involves defeating an enemy in the same way - it’s more about achieving your own goals.'' 

(See also Marketing’s maneuver theory for explicit - and controversial use of the military/business metaphor: “The Armory - the online resource for the competitive marketer is the exclusive host for The Art of Attack - How to Attack and Dislodge the Larger Competitor”).

Lakoff and Johnson (1980) argue that we live our life by metaphors.

== Software development: system metaphor ==

In software development the System Metaphor has been adopted as a core practice by the agile community.  Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained defines a system metaphor as: 

“a story that everyone - customers, programmers, and managers -  can tell about how the system works.”   p. 179.

Wake argues that we seek a system metaphor for several reasons:

'''Common Vision:''' To enable everyone to agree on how the system works. The metaphor suggests the key structure of how the problem and the solution are perceived. This can make it easier to understand what the system is, as well as what it could be.

'''Shared Vocabulary:''' The metaphor helps suggest a common system of names for objects and the relationships between them. This can become a jargon in the best sense: a powerful, specialized, shorthand vocabulary for experts. Naming something helps give you power over it.

'''Generativity:''' The analogies of a metaphor can suggest new ideas about the system (both problems and solutions). For example, the metaphor, “Customer service is an assembly line”. This suggests the idea of a problem being handed from group to group to be worked on, but it also raises the question, “What happens when the problem gets to the end of the line - does it just fall off?” This can bring out important issues that might otherwise lurk and fester.
    
'''Architecture:''' The metaphor shapes the system, by identifying key objects and suggesting aspects of their interfaces. It supports the static and dynamic object models of the system. 

Another benefit is '''Generalisability'''. We can use the metaphor to move between developments: &quot;Like the lettuce project, but with more of a greywater approach&quot; is a real sentence used in developing a new project.

Choosing a metaphor takes work.  Hopefully, you’ll traverse deep and rich ground as you come to agreement over an appropriate metaphor.  This an important part of the process and you should attempt to recognise and capture these thoughts.  Jefferies (2001), in an evocative description of an agent-based information retrieval system describes “this program works like a hive of bees, going out for pollen and bringing it back to the hive”.   Although Jefferies doesn’t describe them, it is likely that they tried other metaphors first.  Perhaps  “a vacuum cleaner sucking up all knowledge?...no there’s lots of them and anyway the information is structured -  not just a big dustball, well perhaps a library? no, that is big and static, what we want is something that selectively collects information, like a fleet of recycling trucks...”.  

Some metaphors are used repeatedly in software development.  Some common approaches: 

1. Spreadsheet Metaphor

2 Script Metaphor

3 Manufacturing Metaphor (e.g. LinesStationsBinsParts or AssemblyLine)

4 Accounting Metaphor (double-entry archive notation)

5 Shopping Cart Metaphor (e-commerce)

6 Auction Metaphor (e-commerce)

7 Blackboard Metaphor (ai)

8 Document Processor (desktop systems where the “model” gets saved as a file)

9 Virtual Space Metaphor (eg. VR)

10 Desktop Metaphor

11 Tools and Materials Metaphor

12 Buttons Everywhere Metaphor

13 Person - what would a person employed to do this job do?  

(other sometimes useful metaphors: bank, courts, newspaper, farm, road map, police indentikit) 



In cases where no one can think of an appropriate metaphor (with or without vivid imagery), the approach is to develop a “naive metaphor”.  This means that you describe the system more literally (a student management system would have student and enrolment objects etc).  The disadvantage of this is that it isn’t really a metaphor - you won’t gain any deeper understanding or insights as it is rooted in what you already know.   Try and avoid 'nearly computing' metaphors - concepts such as a CD rack are too close to computing to be useful.

===Process===

So, what do we do with this system metaphor?  For some Agile proponents, the system metaphor forms that basis for much of the programming, the tenor and subjects of the metaphor directly translating to classes and patterns.  

We take a lighter approach.  The system metaphor is primarily a tool for discussion here in the functional requirements of the first iteration.  It may also prove useful to prompt thought in the Interaction Design  of Iteration 2.

The metaphor should be stated in simple terms.  As Ryan states: “The system is a bakery” jibes better than “The system interprets text as commands and executes them against builders that produce resultant objects and attach assorted decorators, sorting them via pipes and filters to the correct bins; the user can than browse and eat them as needed.” (C2 2006).

Once you have a metaphor, the trick is to explore all of its characteristics, writing them down on paper or whiteboard.  These ideas will flow directly to the user stories or functional requirements.


{{Adfexemplar |Project management software | Software Engineering 2006 |

For a project to develop a project management and group collaboration tool, a metaphor of a fridge door was useful:


* always there (you don’t have to open it to find information),
* messages to family (from each other, phone messages)
* calendar (today, arrangements, upcoming events)
* shopping list
* security strap (to stop little chocolate stealers)
* inspiration (“do you need that chocolate?” sticker)
* progress charts (weight gain/loss)
* family cleaning/cooking roster
* current work (especially for younger ones, sketches named and sometimes dated)
* document repository (music tickets, bills to pay) - interestingly layered!
* reconfigurable (information held together by fridge magnets)
* teaching role (alphabet letters introducing words and information to little ones).
* star chart (kids’ behaviour management, behaviour contract and rewards).
* public place,
* central place: we go past it as part of normal life (work)flow (but without it jumping out and interrupting)
* achievements (kids’ school certificates)
* photos of family (selves and relatives/baby photos)
* newspaper clippings
* limited space, information has to be managed to avoid loss in clutter (but this is done without any rules, design or manager) (note, I did write “it does this” here, the door itself of course doesn’t do anything except act as a static repository, it is the family who actively manage the information).
* phone numbers (family/friends/doctor’s etc)
* menu/phone number for pizza place

...and does all these things without getting in way of real job (keeping food cold - our system mustn’t get in way of the project being undertaken).  An alternative metaphor for this project was a car dashboard (see below), another was a library.

}}

For another project, a community based surf report system for surfers, a single system metaphor proved elusive. The process, however, was very useful. As we explored possible system metaphors - a newspaper; a radio snow report; a school newsletter - the reasons why these didn't work as metaphors effectively built a list of characteristics of our system.

== Tricks ==


{{drop|W}}hile a different metaphor might be better, it is unlikely that a metaphor can be wrong, especially if you are using it as a tool for exploration.  ''If you realise that another metaphor is better, then good, it means that you have made a breakthrough in your understanding''. 

Rather than “wrong” the worst outcome is that the metaphor becomes a cause of miscommunication.  The following is extracted from the c2.com/xp wiki: 

''Ask yourself, what more familiar things is this problem like? Is it really like ordering coffee from a fancy coffee machine? Is it really mostly like steering (tacking) a sailboat across a lake? driving from Toronto to Paris? (...a journey of less than 90 minutes, since Paris is just on the other side of Brantford. -- RandyMacDonald) (just to avoid the CanadianCulturalAssumption)
''
''You mean Paris, Kentucky, right? :) Or perhaps a polar route during a cold winter...''

''* Whoever tried to clean this up by deleting didn’t fix the underlying problem, so I put it back. Next WikiGnome: clarify the driving-from-Toronto-to-Paris issue or leave as is for now.''

''No, best left! It illustrates rather beautifully the way subtle misunderstandings can arise. Developer-One says: “This is like driving to Paris”, meaning a short journey. Developer-Two gets a mental image of driving through the Chunnel from the UK to France, and considers how to avoid trains. Developer-Three (in the USA) ponders submarine cars. The misunderstandings here highlight the importance of MeaningDependsOnContext in discussions, especially about something as crucial as the SystemMetaphor. -- BenLast''

We have to be careful then , to avoid “false insights”.   

Before you discard a metaphor for another, be sure to capture all the characteristics of the first - they will still be useful in the Planning Game.  Also, capture the things that lead you to make that change in metaphor.  The things wrong with the metaphor can define your system just as well. 

A metaphor needs to be familiar enough to the group that needs to use it.  To say that it is “an accrual accounting system but for carbon credits” might be a perfect metaphor for the financial accountants but if such accounting isn’t understood by the programmers, then it will act to confuse rather than enlighten.  

Sometimes the metaphor limits understanding.  The  paper based rows and columns spreadsheet was a strong model in the development of spreadsheets (!), but  the conceptual leap from the paper to the real power of a modern spreadsheet is quite large.  This leads to the danger of introducing “magic”: “it’s like a magic whiteboard”.  While this helpfully encompasses all of the basic functions of a whiteboard, the real innovation of the system is hidden behind a veneer of “magic”. 

We also need to know when to give up on the metaphor.   The project management development described above by the fridge door metaphor was also described by a car dashboard.  This worked extremely well as a system metaphor in early stages: unobtrusive but critical monitoring of vital indicators etc, but became cumbersome when used as the basis for the interface design (dials, steering wheel with leather trim and so on).

Metaphors work best when you give them chance to work.  As soon as you start slipping back to describing characteristics of computing things (security, login in, etc), try and lift your thinking back to a more abstract metaphor.  One way to do this is to think about the metaphor on steroids - what would a super x look like?  Be careful though, as discussed above, you have to more specific than a &quot;magic x&quot;.






===example: dashboard===

{{Adfexemplar |Dashboard | Software Engineering 2006 |

The dashboard metaphor was useful in developing ideas for a project management system (in fact, one to support the Agile Development Framework).  Using the familiar concept of the car dashboard providing critical information was a useful way of thinking about what information project groups needed to be able to see constantly; what events would prompt warning lights etc.  Some groups continued the metaphor for the whole development process, it, got complicated when we tried to mix the notion of drilling down for more information (not a function one would normally find on a car dashboard).

{{Adfexemplar |Talking with Leonardo | Chrissie Jackson and Jonathon Ung  for Otago Museum|

The Leonardo Talking Head robot is an interactive robot with a personality. The robot will accept speech and respond back. It is designed primarily for children and has the ability to educate users on the works and life of Leonardo.

Leonardo greets visitors when someone activates the sensor. He has four main topics that he can talk about: Art, History, Machines and Science. This project is in conjunction with designers who are making the actual head.

For this project, an actor metaphor was used: 

* Greets Audiences.
* Play a scene
* An actor can talks, sings, dances, and with hand sign languages
* Convert Ideas and concepts of plays to customers
* Display sense of humours
* Fashion and styles representation
* Have characters and roles with different emotions display
* Skills of communication with audiences in verbal, nonverbal acts.
* He /she can be a moral model to the general public.
* Reflects the reality of life to audiences.
* Audiences can experience the different emotions involves as well,
* Such as fear, joy, peace, sadness, anxiety, happiness.
* Promotes business ventures.
* Provides a mean of escape/fantasy
* Provides entertainment, know ledges, and sense of appreciation
* Provides information to educate.
* Actor can be a representation of fame.

This metaphor was useful in helping us understand the system because it shows the characteristics we need to take into consideration when developing the system.

===Metaphor for business opportunity ===

If you are really stuck, then one way of making a naive metaphor work is to think about metaphors for the business opportunity (rather than a metaphor for the information system itself.  This may be particularly useful when the business opportunity itself is hard to comprehend.  

{{Adfexemplar |eLivingCampus| Software Engineering 2008 |

The groups first developed metaphors for the whole project:

* Coffee cup good content, recyclable, logos, inspirational quote,

* Encyclopedia: stores information, index, pictures, summaries, searchable, updated regularly, accurate, online and hard copy

* Living organism: dynamic, inputs/outputs, conditions, intelligent, feeding ideas, 

* A road map: information organised logically according to what you need to know at a glance but also can find find detail, legend and key structure, mobile, translates well to digital (mobile GPS etc), foldable (to highlight area of interest). 

* CD rack: holds lots of information, can be sorted by user, expandable, information can be sampled, 

Some of these metaphors turned out to be too close to computing.  The encyclopedia and the CD rack, for example, didn't really offer much new insight - they describe any generic computer system.

Perhaps because the Living Campus itself is not something the students had encountered before, we then switched tack, and  thought about metaphors for the Living Campus itself.  What are the characteristics of familiar businesses (or institutions or processes) that could be used to help think about the Living Campus - then, what are the information needs of those metaphors?

[[Image:DeveofaMetaphor.png |align=&quot;left&quot;]]

The Living Campus Information Infrastructure project benefited from thinking about information needs of other businesses:

* Wartime propaganda: selectively positive, well organised, sense of urgency, targeted messages, constant broadcast

* Olympics: complex network, many different needs, instantaneous integration of results and other media, tailored for and by different markets, pride, competitive, sponsors at different levels, logos embedded throughout

* Marketing a company: logo, contact details, descriptions of customers, testimonials, showcases innovation, innovation needed in getting attention, case studies

* Count Calendar (long running NZ farming TV programme): relevance to farming but most of audience not farmers, educational mixed with entertainment, narrative, further information, sponsorship, house style

* Greenpeace: headline seeking but backed by evidence, moral high ground, 

* Building development: plans, consents, &quot;what is happening here?&quot;, engineering modelling, artists' impressions.

* Museum: mix education and entertainment, what's on show, categories, must be correct (though note importance of user understandings), can be boring, wayfaring, mixed audiences, changeable, house style, interactive, helpful staff

* Art gallery: (museum +), layout, elitist, events, interpretive information, database, catalogue, collection, openings, storage, 

* Zoo: feeding times, breeding programme, animal and visitor behaviour management,school trip bookings, gift shops, conservation, fund raising, weather, seasonal

* A&amp;P show: community oriented society, supported by other societies, schools involved, competitions, community participation, outdoors (some exhibit halls), weather contingency, event, showcases community, animals and plants, business stalls, something for everyone, marketing, localised but regional and national structures, unique characters, interactive, committee structures,

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bite: Mapping the users’ interaction as they carry out tasks
Time: 5% of development time

Input: Tasks
Process evidence: Dialogue diagrams
Client: Discussion, testing
 
Dialogue: the sequence of interaction between a user and a system.



Dialogue diagrams are used to visually map the steps in the user tasks.  Like the user tasks, the focus is on the users interaction with the system.  By drawing the steps involved in the interaction, actions that may have been missed out are discovered. 

You will encounter different types of dialogue diagrams.  You can use whichever type is most meaningful for your project.

1.	Hoffer focuses on the interface (See page 484). The boxes in the diagram represent the actual screens the user is seeing.  The arrows between the boxes represent the path between the screens.  It is important to indicate all possible flows through the system (forward and backward).  
These diagrams are well suited to web pages and applications where each user action occurs on a separate interface.  They can be used as the basis for a site map, showing navigational paths.

2.	We prefer a less structured and more detailed dialogue diagram, which takes into account that the user may carry out many actions on one page.  We are interested in capturing all details of the user task, so draw all of the steps you can think of.  Here, the boxes describe what is happening between user and interface (eg, enter address details), the arrows point to the next event. The key question is: “What happens next?” 



It is not important that you produce perfectly constructed diagrams.  
As usual, we like to see evidence of development.  This dialogue diagram is a draft.

It is important that your diagrams

•	Are understandable  - do they help you and the client to understand what your system does?

•	Represent your tasks accurately

•	Are complete – don’t leave your users stuck in a dead end.



== Dialogue Diagram: ==

Initially we include only those steps that demonstrate the “straight-through” path.  It is important to have a complete dialogue diagram before considering all of the other possible routes through your system.  Remember that all of your users are unique, and none of them are predictable.  



== Sequence Diagram: ==


Next, you need to draw the links representing the other paths.  Key question: “What if…?”
If possible, photocopy your dialogue diagrams and edit them with a different coloured pen.

•	Can the users save their changes from any screen?  

•	Can they exit from any screen?  

•	Do they need to go back if they make a mistake?  Does that reset the form?

•	Can they edit their entries on a previous screen?

•	Forgot password.

•	What error messages might the user see?

•	How does the system handle incomplete entries?

•	Is there a help feature on each screen?


Don’t include options such as “computer crashed”; unless such factors are a particular feature of your development environment, assume a functional computer and network. 

Group similar actions together.  E.g., “enter name”, “enter street”, “enter city”, etc, can usually be included in a single action “enter personal details”.

Sometimes several related tasks can be combined into one large diagram.


== Testing ==

You can test your dialogue diagrams against your tasks.  Have a group member read out the steps in the task, while you check the diagram.  Does the task need to be edited?

Use the Interaction Cases to test your system.  If you were Joe Student, how would you carry out this task?  Make notes about the testing of your system.



== Case Study ==

For a fashion website a task “comment on user’s wardrobe” was expanded into the the following dialogue diagram.  Despite the complexity of interaction represented here (see over page for a tidied view), the wireframe interface (initial view top left here) shows a single coherent interface. 

The whiteboard version was tidied up a little to produce a working Dialogue Diagram with a simultaneous development of the data model (following a “no magic in either direction” approach).
Case Study: First Call Resolution

For a system to support call centre operators the functional requirement “Provide Course Information” generated a task “Provide course information to a caller”.  In developing a dialogue diagram, it soon became apparent that this high level task was hiding a great deal of complexity.

The dialogue step “Query caller” turned out to form a structured conversation that could take many different routes.  The trick in developing the wireframe interfaces is going to be to bring all these different pathways back into a single coherent interface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Arriving at an agile framework for teaching software engineering


Abstract
This paper describes the pathway by which have arrived at teaching a particular combination of agile and structured methodologies in a software engineering course within a vocational computing degree.  The background of teaching to a pure structured approach is followed by descriptions of eight iterations of increasing agility.  The current approach: the “agile framework” is introduced and described. 

Keywords:  capstone projects, computer education, value proposition

1	Introduction
Teaching software engineering at undergraduate level poses the challenge of presenting a robust discipline to students while reflecting industry currency, as software engineering methodologies have been continuously evolving since inception. The recent emergence of the agile methodologies is a significant shift away from established software engineering practices.  This has created what Booch (2004) calls “method wars”.   The pathway of an institution as picks its way though this battlefield is of interest because it provides a model for considering how the next changes, as yet unforeseen, might be incorporated. 
In this paper we describe a case study, that of the authors’ pathway in arriving at an ‘agile framework’.  The authors’ problem was to determine a framework for introducing agile development within the course without losing the benefits of the structured approach that had been successfully taught over the past six years.  Despite the military analogy used by Booch (2004), this pathway is seen as an evolution rather than a revolution.
In the following sections we first examine the requirements for a methodology for teaching.  We then describe the evolution of the teaching methodology employed.  


2	Requirements of a methodology for teaching software engineering
Boehm (2004) describes the conflict between plan driven or predictive methodologies and the agile approach and states that “successful, sustainable software development requires both discipline and agility”.  In industry, being able to adapt quickly to change can give an organisation the cutting edge over competitors, by reducing time to market and better meeting client requirements.  However, to ensure software systems are robust, it is essential that the development is based on sound, disciplined practices.  
In adopting an agile approach, developers need to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  Traditional methods, while often held up as a key factor in disastrous software engineering project failures (Standish 1994) have been successfully used in projects for more than 40 years.
Agile methods are also continually evolving as more developers apply the principles in new contexts.  In fact, Conboy (2004), asserts that “there is no universally accepted definition of an agile method in the field of Information Systems Development”.
Noble, Marshall, Marshall, &amp; Biddle (2004) note that the shift to an agile approach in industry “has created a need for a similar shift in software engineering education”, explaining that “document centric project methodologies do not align well with students’ reasonable expectations of more agile working methods”.
The issue then, is not how to teach agile or even how to introduce agile elements into the course (Keefe &amp; Dick, 2004) but to present a coherent model for teaching the ‘middle ground’ as a sustainable approach to software engineering education and to prepare them for the capstone project.  In providing the students with a coherent range of techniques for software development, they are then well prepared to apply the appropriate strategy in their capstone projects and in the workforce.  Boehm (2004) quotes Phillippe Kruchten, architect of the Rational Unified Process, as likening CMM for Software to a dictionary –in making the desired point “there is no need to use all the words available” (p23).  Similarly, a robust framework presenting the middle ground of software engineering can incorporate methodologies from both agile and plan driven approaches, along with strategies for selecting the appropriate tools for the job at hand.
What are the requirements for a robust methodology for teaching software engineering?   It should incorporate a real-life client to mirror an industry experience. It should be flexible (to demonstrate adaptability to change, both in the project and in teaching).  It should have a user focus – rather than a plan focussed approach, and it should be applicable over a wide variety of projects, including hardware and network based projects.
2.1	The Agile  Model
In 2001, a group of developers met in Snowbird, Utah to discuss the state of  software development.  They had, by various paths, come to the same conclusion - that software quality could be improved by the use of ‘light’ methodologies, with an emphasis on communication, simplicity and embracing change.  At this meeting, the term “Agile Method” was coined, and a radically new approach to software development was launched. (Smits, 2005). These developers, including Kent Beck (Extreme Programming) and Ken Schwaber (Scrum Methodology) formed the Agile Alliance, which was dedicated to the  promotion of the agile approach.  They formulated the shared values of the agile movement.
Agility implies
•	individuals and iterations over processes and tasks
•	working software over comprehensive documentation 
•	customer collaboration over contract negotiation
•	responding to change over following a plan.
3	Case study of our evolution
In reviews of the 1999 capstone projects and in assessing the 1998 projects we felt that students weren’t getting enough structure and the process was being treated as a game (this itself was a decision by the previous lecturer to follow a simulation based experiential model).  
The IT205 course is one semester at second year and is a compulsory pre-requisite for the capstone project.  
We decided to adopt a strategy of making it real: “real projects for real clients” and to follow an “empowerment” approach (Robinson 1994).  These decisions were influenced by papers at the time describing the needs of the New Economy and others describing the importance of the student experience.  We aimed to create an educational environment or culture that would enable students to move into the New Economy.  This entailed a change in approach to one where the focus was on student empowerment.  This empowerment was multifaceted – the course handout was presented as a draft; the course content was changed according to needs of the project and students; the students managed the relationship with the client, projects were self assessed and so on.  The other change was to adopt a real project for a real client, in that year a ship safety system for an Offshore Master (Mann &amp; Buissink-Smith, 2000).   
The structure of the course was a strict adherence to a seven stage document-centred Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as described by Hoffer, Valacich &amp; George (2004).  The course did not include implementation, as it was felt that the students would be better focussed on the best development if they were not hampered by the knowledge (worry?) that they would have build what they designed.  
The approach taken in this and subsequent years was to attempt to expose students to ‘real world’ situations, while maintaining a positive and constructive learning environment.  Within the bounds of the academic environment and staying true to the SDLC, we endeavoured to replicate “real world experiences”.  In 2001, we enforced a project swap on project groups (Smith, Mann &amp; Buissink-Smith, 2001).   A “run over by a bus” (ROBAB) scenario was repeatedly used in class to emphasise to the students the importance of project documentation.   At the end of the Analysis phase, some groups were required to swap their project documentation and continue with the new project and documentation.  
For some students the effect of this was catastrophic.   One student responded with a dramatic outburst shouting as he slammed the door: “I came here to learn and excel, not be dealing with other people’s xxxx”, but most quietly accepted the revision and began to plan their next course of action.  In this instantiation, the students benefited from the heavyweight structure.   A student comment reported in Smith et al. (2001) seems particularly interesting in hindsight: 
 “It was important to keep in mind that the process seemed more important than the final product.” (SF)
At the time we interpreted this as ‘we were focussed on learning the process’, but in hindsight we wonder if the process was dominating, ie they were learning SDLC rather than software engineering or perhaps focussing on the client’s product development?
At first glance the swapping process would appear to be in conflict with the concepts of empowerment.  Most of the concepts of empowerment have been at least dented by the bus crash – in particular are issues of ownership of the process, choices and possibly even “perpetrators and victims of discipline”.  The empowerment model, however, does not say that the teacher cannot challenge the students, indeed the model describes students who are “actively engaged in meaningful experiences that the teacher facilitates”.  For a while our software-engineering students perceived they had no control, but soon realised they could do it, this, is in a large part due to the stability and framework offered by the SDLC.  The students who swapped thought we should repeat the exercise.  So, while the locus of control dislocates for a time, it quickly returns and the overall feeling toward the course was positive.  
In subsequent years the use of real clients and projects in software engineering has continued (Mann &amp; Smith, 2004, 2005).  Students undertake a development for these clients, following a prescribed SDLC development process (with increasing agility), accompanied by theoretical instruction.  The intention is that the students experience the scope of software engineering with all the implicit difficulties: client issues; complexity of business systems and group work.  
The increasing agility has been threefold.  First we have seen an increasing importance of prototyping and user centred design.  The second factor is the evolution of the SDLC in the primary text Hoffer et al (2005).  While the first edition gives a seven stage SDLC, by the third it is a five stage model and in the 4th edition it is actually drawn as a cycle.
The third factor in increasing agility has come about through an increasingly varied selection of clients.  Our approach has been one of teaching the whole SDLC, but focussing on those aspects required for that particular client project.   For example, a development of learning and motivation software was prompted by a desire to introduce a project that was much undefined and had more potential for creative work than previous data driven systems.  This was a perfect exercise for teaching the importance of early stages of development, the client had little idea of what he wanted, he only recognised that he would benefit from exploring such developments to “be a global player and have more free time”.  It also was good in highlighting to students the value of SDLC stages in progressing the project.  This project excited students but as it progressed they found it frustrating as it was so ill-defined.  
An animal ethics management system was chosen in response to the open ended Motivation project – we wanted a project that was tightly defined.  The student groups worked with a client from a crown research institute to develop an animal tracking and ethical approval system.  This was to integrate with existing systems.  This development suited the scope of the SDLC and was ideal for the data analysis phases as there was much extant processes and information:
In some cases, the structure imposed by the SDLC gave the students the wrong message, one of deterministic development.  A tightly scoped development of generic software with three clients (a Job management system for small engineering businesses) resulted in multiple outcomes according to the client was not appreciated by the students:
 “why are there so many different outcomes to the same problem…I felt the lecturers let down the process by not doing enough homework on what was going to result…shouldn’t the lecturers have get a tighter reign” (SF)
Our comments at the time:
“it was interesting to see the groups using the SDLC to create some order from chaos…we need to make it clear that students are marked on ability to demonstrate the process, not on actual outcome”. (LecNotes)
Other software engineering projects have included a student management system project which was interesting as the students initially thought it too small but in reality is, of course, a huge undertaking.  This realisation was drawn out by the development process.  It became a challenging project.  
A client from the maritime museum came to us saying that he wanted a webpage.  We could immediately see that there was much more to his needs than that.  This task appealed as it turned out to be much bigger than students’ initial understanding.  The complexity of museum data, the integration of many existing systems, and the potential for multiple directions meant that very quickly the students realised that without a firm development methodology they would be swimming.
In 2003 we were able to produce guidelines for the selection of software engineering projects.  In addition to being real, exciting and interesting, we stated that the project should “facilitate teaching the structure of the chosen methodology (SDLC, especially each stage, milestones).  For early stage developments the client should have an idea of a business problem, but not a solution…facilitate teaching each of the methodologies’ (SDLC) range of tools and techniques. The more creative projects are better for logical design work but are difficult to apply to data modelling”. 
In 2005 we investigated the relationship between project methodology, the scale of the project, and student learning. The value of a formal methodology is emphasised by a large and complex project can lead to good outcomes, emphasizing the role of in providing a pathway:
“When we first looked at the brief for Captain Black we thought that the scope for the project had the potential to be much larger than anything we could confidently develop” (SF)
This, though, can have a disempowering effect, a potentially huge project was clearly not feasible and students lost interest, poor groups scoping this project very small, to the extent of developing little more than login systems.  
At the other end of the scale, a very small project can further shrink as students lose interest as a result of feeling that the SDLC process is overkill.  In the middle of this are tasks that turn out to be much bigger than students’ initial understanding.  
In an experiment in 2004 (Mann &amp; Smith, 2005) separate streams were presented with different projects of differing technical scope.  While the intention was that the differences were in size, the actual differences in project were in the ability of the client to specify their business problem.  Again, the structure of the SDLC gave the students a framework within which to tackle the problem:
 “At the onset I had no clue of being able to do what was required, so I didn’t have a preconception about what it would look like.  I did not think we could do it and definitely not me.  Now I see it can be done…” (SF)
Unfortunately, the vagaries of the second problem were not overcome by the structure.  Instead students went through the motions, often providing meaningless statements.
“Due to additional requirements needed by VideoShop regarding their current video rental system, an opportunity has arisen to develop a new enhanced system which will meet these requirements.  The current system lacks features required by management and staff to progress financially in the business” (SW). 
Neither set of groups responded to the opportunity for consideration of complex interactions, even the strongest groups only touched the surface of the areas we had identified as complex.
We have then, an evolution of a model that, while based on the SDLC, has seen increasing flexibility.  The underlying framework has several advantages.  It has provided a base process to return to when things go wrong, it lays out a clear pathway for development and has predictability for teaching.
In parallel to the ongoing development of software engineering are the developments of the industry or capstone project itself.   Following on from our software engineering course, it is not surprising that students describe as their chosen methodology an ‘SDLC mixed with prototyping’.  The issue of what such a description might imply goes beyond computer education: both the scientific and trade literature widely cover issues of prototypes (fidelity, evolutionary/revolutionary etc) but a model for the successful integration remains elusive.  Hakim and Spitzer (2000) argued that the “challenge is to systematically incorporate prototypes into the software design and development lifecycle”.   
In 2003 we aimed to explore the role of development methodology in successful capstone projects, in particular the extent, nature and integration of prototyping (Mann &amp; Smith, 2004).  By examining the characteristics of exemplar projects we described a development framework and then verified this model by using it to describe a larger corpora of projects. 
These we distilled into an exemplar development framework.
1.	“SDLC”  identified methodology
2.	Prototyping used
3.	Strong functional requirements used
4.	Functional requirements tested with low fidelity but high interactivity prototypes
5.	Stable platform for development developed early
6.	Prototypes part of integrated testing plan
7.	Early functional deliverable to client
8.	Robust final deliverable
9.	Still need ‘normal’ design – prototyping doesn’t replace
10.	Prototypes used in communication with client
11.	Maturation by revolutionary (cf evolutionary).  Staged replacement for hardware.
A side finding in Mann &amp; Smith (2004) was that despite a prescribed document-centric process, there was only a weak relationship between the pages of documentation and assessed grade. 
We also found that poorer groups did less prototyping, which is understandable; they did less of other things too.  What is critical is that when they did prototyping they did not also do “normal design” nor have stable systems, early delivery etc.   Poorer groups that used prototypes in early stages also had very weak functional requirements, did not have strong testing plans etc, in other words the prototype became the development in total.   Groups in the middle ranges that did prototypes tended to have weaker logical and physical design, instead they saw the development as one of making the prototype robust.  
In 2004 we were able to conclude that “the tension between product and process can be lessened by adopting a process that can be seen to produce good products while being flexible and robust.  We believe that the development framework described here will provide a foundation for capstone courses”.
In 2004 this development framework was made compulsory for all capstone projects (Mann &amp; Smith, 2005) to great success.  The results showed that project groups did follow the framework and significant increase in the average grade with a reduction in the failing grades.  Again, the relationships of parameters within the framework shows that for weaker groups the incremental traditional SDLC process does not sit well with an early development model.
In implementing the framework the following instructions were given:  
We require that you follow the SDLC under an umbrella of Agile Software Development.  This gives the benefits of the structure of SDLC while adding flexibility of agile development. 
The focus of the project is on the production of robust working systems (software, hardware and maintenance documentation).  Planning, comprehensive development documentation and processes are important but are 'means to an end' with a focus on content rather than format/representation.  It is expected that you discard most of the models you develop (although you do have to keep them for assessment!).
We also put emphasis on prototyping and testing.  We are going through the SDLC twice.  The first iteration is to analyse and design and release (usually to the client) a system that meets most of the functional requirements.  The second iteration is intended to review the success of the first iteration in meeting business requirements, to review functional requirements (there will probably be more), and to deliver a stylish &quot;bullet proof&quot; implementation. 
To enforce framework components such as early deliverables, the following milestones were set:
You are required to have at least four significant deliveries of system.
1. Requirements prototype. At the end of the analysis stage.  This is a prototype aimed to test functional requirements.
2. Stable platform (week 12).  The platform for your system should be developed and tested.  For example, for a database with a web front end we would expect you to demonstrate connectivity and basic database functions via the web (insert, delete, query, update) plus any standard infrastructure (login etc).
3. Major release 1, week 25. Deliver to the client a system that meets most of their needs.   This system should be usable and stable.  
4. Major release 2, week 42. Deliver to the client a production system that meets all of their needs.  
Although the overall pattern was clearly one of improved grades, the weaker groups, again, demonstrated confusion over the relationships between aspects of agile methodology and the traditional processes.   These groups can be characterised as either developing a prototype and initially testing it, but this becomes the project, the subsequent robust development is poor, or are poor at incorporating early development and testing into SDLC. 
3.1	Summary of evolution to date
The methodology used was primarily Systems Development Life Cycle (based on Hoffer et al, 2004) but had evolved over the six years of teaching the course.  The limitations of existing system were that it had become documentation heavy and provided limited access to the client.  In addition, students were writing requirements early before they really knew what the client wanted.  As the project was not implemented, students moving into the capstone project had little experience of the implementation issues and often failed to produce the required outcomes.  
By 2005, the taught methodology had evolved to a modified SDLC but with an agile “umbrella” – recognising the importance of embracing change throughout the process.  An ethical risk management approach has been introduced using the SoDIS tool, and a usability focus applied in design.  
The taught methodology in second year could be described as a lose SDLC with a heavy emphasis on prototyping and with a strong user focus but with out considering implementation.  The capstone project, meanwhile, was a “twice through the SDLC” also with focus on prototyping where the emphasis in assessment was on implementation and deployment.  Many agile methods were actively encouraged (especially scrum meetings, pair programming, test based development, user involvement).
4	Agile framework approach
Described here is a development framework that incorporates agile development approaches in a structured framework.
The focus of the project is on the production of robust working systems (software, hardware and maintenance documentation).  Planning, comprehensive development documentation and processes are important but are 'means to an end' with a focus on content rather than format/representation.  It is expected that students discard most of the models they  develop, although they do have to keep them for assessment, this we describe as an evidence portfolio.  The emphasis is on evidence of a rational process so we encourage time spent annotating diagrams rather than tidying them for presentation.   
Any development methodology can be seen as a process of reducing uncertainty.  At the beginning, we have only an idea, or a business problem to address, there are a great many uncertainties.  At the end we have a functional system.  The pressures affecting the level of uncertainty at any one time can be seen as interacting streams of work (Figure 1 and 2). 
 
 Figure 1: Pressures affecting uncertainty. 
  
Figure 2: Five interacting streams of work.

 
Figure 3: Sectors of importance of different aspects
The varying proportions of each stream coalesce into “sectors” defined by a deliverable output, steering and communication with the client (Figure 3).  The sectors here can be seen to resemble a structured development process but crucially, allow for a flexible pathway according to project needs.
For both Software Engineering and the Capstone Project we use three iterations (Figure 4).   The first iteration is aimed at building understanding within the development group and client.   The second iteration is aimed at designing and releasing (to the client) a system that meets many of the functional requirements.  The third iteration, “robust delivery” is intended to review the success of the second iteration in meeting business requirements, to review functional requirements (there will probably be more), and to deliver a robust and stylish “bullet proof” implementation.   

 

Figure 4: Three iterations.
At any one time, then students are working in a sector made up of the five work streams, being one of three iterations and having a focus on a particular area.  Each sector is defined by what it produces (Table 1).  Although we aim to provide students with a suite of tools that may be used within each sector, so long as they can provide evidence of a rational process (see evidence portfolio below), we are less concerned with the internals of the sector.  
Sector diagrams are used to illustrate position on development framework and flow of information (Figure 5).  This is the crux of our approach in mixing structure and agility.  Students are encouraged to adapt these diagrams meaning that they don’t have to complete every task suggested, so long as they can show that there has been a rational process of getting from the input to the output (petri net concepts have been useful here).  In the second iteration we are covering the tools and techniques with only an agile leaning, in the third iteration the focus is the agile techniques.
The underlined items in Table 1 form the basis of assessment for the courses.  75% of the marks come from implementation, although, similar to the argument above, this must be backed by “rationale for decisions”.  This 75% consists of 10% for stable platform, 15% for 2nd release and 50% for final delivery.  The rationale for decisions is given in an evidence portfolio.  In addition, client satisfaction is considered a threshold requirement in order to be assessed. 

 
Figure 5: Sector diagrams used to illustrate position on development framework and flow of information (this one for second iteration: design concepts).
In the first functional release the emphasis is on getting a useful system to the client.  The components in the assessment are timely, rationale for decisions and technical competence.  In the final robust delivery, these are joined by quality assurance activities and outcomes; implementation; deployment; technical complexity and client documentation.
5	Conclusion
In this paper we have described the pathway we have followed in arriving at an agile framework for teaching software engineering.   This approach combines agile and structured methodologies in a way that promotes agility whilst giving an underlying structure for development and teaching.

In Iteration One, we used the Planning Game to identify some high level requirements for the system.  These requirements were then used to define the scope of the system (metaphor), for the ethical analysis, and were the basis for the first release. They have provided a communication tool for discussing the project with the client and within the development group. 

The agile movement’s approach to requirements is two-fold
1. Requirements always change
2. It is not possible to define all requirements at the beginning of the project

[[Image:Fr_whiteboard_close.JPG]]
[[Software Engineering with an Agile Development Framework/Iteration Two/Functional requirements/Worked example|Worked example]]

It is important to understand that requirements are not a magical, defined entity.  No-one knows what all the requirements are.  Each user will have a perspective, and all views may be correct.  We have described the requirements determination stage as a ‘fishing expedition’.  Cohn (2005) extends this metaphor by explaining that “different sized nets can be used to capture different sized requirements” (p43).  Our initial Planning Game was the first pass, capturing the biggest and most obvious requirements.  In this iteration we will use a smaller mesh size, to ‘capture’ the smaller requirements.  

Further, Cohn explains that “requirements, like fish, mature and possibly die” (p43).  Requirements defined in the first iteration may become redundant as other requirements are defined, or what seemed a minor requirement may become a critical component of the project.  (These are the requirements that begin as a “wouldn’t it be good if the system could also…?” conversation.)

And lastly on the fishing theme, while you won’t capture all the requirements on your trawling expedition, and you might haul in some extraneous seaweed or crabs, a skilled requirements trawler will use the best techniques to make the expedition efficient.  

Requirements Specification Documents
Traditional software development methodologies use Requirements Specification documents to define the scope of a project.  This approach assumes that we can “get the requirements right the first time, complete, concise and clear.” http://satc.gsfc.nasa.gov/support/STC_APR98/do_reqmnt/do_reqmnt.pdf

Many large development organisations publish requirements standards, which suppliers need to comply with for tender purposes.  Check out the NASA website for a great source of these.  A requirements specification  document can be huge and defines the requirements down to the smallest detail.  Many months and sometimes years can be dedicated to this level of requirements analysis.

As an example of the level of detail involved, the requirements specification for the ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility for the Mars Lander includes this requirement: 
“ASPERA-3 and MEX OA IDFS data and any APAF-generated intermediate files of ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry shall be provided to all ASPERA-3 Co-I’s.”  (from  www.aspera-3.org/idfs/APAF_SRS_V1.0.pdf)

These documents are a result of a structured, often waterfall, methodology.  They are a reasonable attempt to bring some certainty into the software development process, in the context of rampant project failure. They also provide a legal and contractual basis for the development. The financial justification for this approach stems from a view that change in a project is a bad thing and that as soon as we can agree on the “correct” requirements we can move on to the design and build stages.  


Cost of Change Graphs
The Cost of Change curve is hotly debated in the Agile forum.  
The traditional view (here we are talking about a single release of a product in a waterfall methodology) holds that changes in requirements occurring in the early stages of the development cycle are cheap to implement because little has been invested in the project.  A change in requirements during the design stage will involve reworking of analysis and design, and will cost more.  Once programming begins, cost start to mount and organisations are likely to resist the work required to repair the damage. (“It will be OK, we can add that feature in the next release”). After the product has been released, changes are prohibitively expensive to implement, involving new releases of the software, updated user documentation and damage to the developer’s reputation.

The agile version suggests that this problem of the cost of change can be resolved.  The flatter agile curve is produced by ensuring that feedback loops are shortened and that every requirement (user story) is tested and verified before it is implemented.  Any incremental or iterative methodology will improve the change curve, by preventing investment in faulty code.

Rule No1 for requirements.  Requirements will change.   
In keeping with the agile principles of  Extreme Programming, we need to embrace change and use communication with the stakeholders to ensure that our understanding of the requirements is sufficient for the development process.  Boehm and Turner (2004) state that “successful, sustainable software development requires both disciplne and agility” (p23).  It is acknowledged that the agile methods are best suited to smaller projects where the client is accessible and requirements may change. While the overhead of a 200 page requirements document is not necessary for most projects, it can be useful to record the requirements to ensure clear understanding has been agreed with the client, especially in larger or mission critical projects.  Writing good requirements is a useful skill which will advance the development team’s understanding of the project.

“Agilists create high-value documentation” (Ambler, 2006).  We will use the planning game to elicit a further set of deeper, more detailed requirements.  In this second iteration we need to understand the user perspective – what does the user need the system to do?   We will produce a draft requirements document that will become the basis for your development through the second iteration.  Have the courage to change your requirements as your understanding of the project changes.  Requirements may be deleted, added or edited at any time during the development. (You will need to justify these decisions!)
Writing good requirements.


Common Problems
Language
The same term is used for the same item in all requirements.
Each requirement can usually be written in the format: 
The System shall provide ........ 
The System shall be capable of ........ 
(It is the industry convention to use “Shall” for requirements, “Will” for statements of fact and 		“Should” for goals.)

The language of the requirements is important. If you find yourself using “Are”, “is”, “was” you are probably describing the system rather than its functionality.  Eg, “The system is storing the student data”.  Preferable is “the system shall store student data”

Avoid unnecessary words such as  “must”, “support” (as in “system will support backups”),“but not limited to”, “etc”, “and/or” and lists.  They cannot easily be defined, cause uncertainty and leave room for multiple interpretations. If requirement is not definable, it may need to go back to the user for further clarification. 

Avoid weak phrases such as: Minimize / Maximize, Rapid, User-friendly, Easy, Sufficient, Adequate, Quick.  
It is preferable to define the actual limits of the system.  Eg, rather than “the system shall enrol students quickly” use “the system shall process each student enrollment within 24 hours.” 

If insufficient information is available – poor requirements will be written because developers will make assumptions about missing information.  The solution is to communicate frequently and clearly.

Avoid describing implementation in requirements.  You need to focus on the what, not the how Eg, “provide a database” Preferable:  “provide capability for storing, displaying and sorting customer data”
This may be a database, but allows for other possibilities, eg an xml file.

Avoid describing the use of the system.
Eg, “System shall allow user to open a dialogue box and enter data”
Preferable:  “system shall allow data entry”

Prioritising

First set of requirements/user stories is often a wish list, including many ‘nice to have’ features.
Refinements and clarifications are negotiated during the course of a project, and the requirements/user stories are defined in further iterations.  Additional requirements or changes to existing requirements are identified in the normal course of engineering a solution.

Who should be involved in prioritising the requirements/stories? 

Client
Developers
Stakeholders

A traditional approach divides requirements into 
	“Essential” requirements are those that must be included in the system
	“Useful” requirements are those that would reduce system effectiveness if left out
	“Desirable” requirements are those that are not part of the core, but make the system more 			attractive to the users priorities.

The agile approach uses the successive iterations to identify the most critical requirements. Which requirements or tasks will be implemented in this iteration? the next iteration?  Both Scrum and eXtreme Programming approaches use a requirements stack to prioritise requirements.  The story cards are  ranked in order, with new cards added at the agreed level.  Cards can be removed or reprioritized.  At any time, the developers are implementing the highest priority requirements.  


Summary
Writing good requirements and user stories is difficult, requires careful thinking and analysis, but is not magical.  With experience, developers can improve the quality of the project and minimise reworking by writing effective and realistic requirements.

Data is...

Why do some argue is most important thing:


Static structure of system
- like a map

Advantages of database approach
Program-data independence
Minimal data redundancy
Improved data consistency
Improved data sharing
Improved data quality
Reduced program maintenance

Difference between data model and database

Modelling process

Data modelling is DESIGN
Creative solutions needed
Data model is one solution to req’s

Data modelling is IMPORTANT
Need a blueprint to build a house

Data modelling is a discipline
Professional judgement required


Entity relationship model:
Detailed graphical representation of 		entities and associations

Focus is purely data
Not what happens to it
Depicts the form of the data
Not the data values
Specific to the needs of the business


Person, place, object, event, concept
that is of interest to the organisation
single, unambiguous names
Student, book, product

Time 
Space
Fuzzy

Association between the instances of one or more entity types
name strongly 
make a sentence to describe the relationship
may have attributes – an associative entity







A book is borrowed by a patron
A patron may borrow a book

Conceptual Schema
A detailed, technology independent specification of the overall structure of a database
Physical Schema
Specifications for how data from a conceptual schema are stored in a computer’s secondary memory




Each entity is described by attributes.  These are what we use to describe the instances of each entity.  There are strict rules about attributes, they need to be independent and not repeating information.   They also need to be atomic (can’t be broken down), and not be dependent on other values.

In the example below, StudentName is unsuitable as it can be broken down into first and surname; StudentAge isn’t necessary as it can be calculated (putting it in by hand is asking for trouble), and StudentGrades is not atomic - ot contains multiple values - which will not work (we’ll come back to this one).

We also need some way of uniquely identfying each instance, this becomes the Primary key for the entity.  This has to be not change be unique. We could use the name but, despite us all feeling special, our names aren’t.  We could combine the name with date of birth and make a concatenated key.  Unfortunately, dates are very difficult to deal with (what is the significance of the 12th of September?) and it doesn’t resolve our non-unique problem (Sam went to school with two Jacqueline Clare Robertsons, both born on 30/7/69).  So we have to use a new value: a STUDENT_ID. 

We can get the same information from these attributes and the data is structured much more powerfully. 
The courses a student is enrolled in is more difficult to solve, but the solution is the heart of the power of a data based (and hence database) approach to understanding the business and implementing a solution.

In the example above Bob is taking only Geography (wise choice), so that is easy to deal with.  Jane, however is taking French, Geography and History.   If we try and store this information in an attribute called Courses it is very difficult to extract this information - while it would be easy to get a list of Jane’s courses, a list of who is taking Geography would be very hard to extract (and involve string manipulation etc). 

The real strength of data modelling, is in the identification of relationships.  A relationship describes the association between entities.  

We can see that there are clear relationships between STUDENT and COURSE, and COURSE and TEACHER.   These assocations can be expressed as sentences: “a STUDENT takes this COURSE”, “a COURSE is taught by a TEACHER” (we’ll come back to cardinality). 

The STUDENT - TEACHER association, however, is not so clear.  The relationship (at least the one we are considering here) is already expresssed by the model. We can extract which teacher is teaching which students via the COURSE they are teaching and enrolled in.  We don’t need a STUDENT-TEACHER relationship. 

Even that this level of consideration, we a being forced to carefully think about the business we are dealing with.  We could have described a STUDENT-TEACHER-COURSE model.  Why have we chosen not to have the STUDENT-TEACHER relationship rather than not having STUDENT-COURSE?

We can also express the numbers of instances that might be involved in the relationship.   Here we have “many STUDENTS may take many COURSES”, or conversely “many COURSES may be taken by many STUDENTS”.   We express the “many” on our diagram with a “crows foot” (hanging on to the many end).  Unfortunately, this gives us a none-specific relationship, we know we have lots of students and lots of courses, but not who is taking what.

One solution to these unconnected lists, is to include attributes for each of the courses someone is taking (below)..  

Unfortunately this doesn’t work either.  What happens when someone enrols in more courses than you have previously thought of, where do the results actually go, and we still don’t have a way of finding out who is enrolled in Geography.

What we need is a new entity to represent this relationship.  This is called an associative entity.  We might have identified it earlier as it is really quite strong in terms of ‘thingness’.   The relationship betweem STUDENT and COURSE also has several parameters in its own right: date, result, perhaps internal assessment grades and so on.  The fact that the relationship has attributes indicates that it is really an entity.   

Again, we come back to the value of this process in understanding the business.  Is it just one entity?  We can think of sveral possible names for the entity - are they the same thing. 

There are cases where multiple names indicate multiple associations - the Human resources manager authorises payment of salaries (one relationship), but is also on the payroll herself.  

This middle entity shows the association between STUDENT and COURSE, ENROLMENT.  

When we implement the model, the ENROLMENT entity (table) does not contain the student’s names, nor the courses - the computer can quite efficiently go and get them.   Instead we just use the primary keys from the other entities  - they become foreign keys.

There is though, a flaw in our model.  Jane Smith seems to be enrolled twice in History.  This is not a mistake (except for Jane) - she failed it the first time.  In order to allow this to happen we need to represent more information, the year of enrolment. 
Our model can generate the information required, it will be useful as the development progresses as we work to make it more tigtly defined.  

The primary focus in functional requirements is the process itself, by developing such a model, we are forced to think carefully about the business we are working with.

== Lesson 3 - '''''What is that?''''' ==
This lesson's goals are to show the third person of verbs' conjugation (in singular and plural) as well as of personal pronouns. Read your first text in Silesian, please.

&lt;small&gt;Note: Read the text and then the vocabulary. There's also the translation, which is available when you click the title of the dialogue, but try not to use it.&lt;/small&gt;

== Grammar ==
=== Sentence structure ===
A typical sentence structure is [[:w:en:Subject Verb Object|SVO]], but any modifications are also possible and do not change the meaning, eg.
&lt;poem&gt;
'''Adam je důma.'''
''Adam is at home.''
'''Adam důma je.'''
''Adam at home is.''
'''Důma je Adam.'''
''At home is Adam.''
'''Důma Adam je.'''
''At home Adam is.''
'''Je Adam důma.'''
''Is Adam at home.''
'''Je důma Adam.'''
''Is at home Adam.''
&lt;/poem&gt;

At this level learn to construct only SVO sentences. Unlike Polish (which is by the way very similar to Silesian) questions are formed only by adding the question mark at the end (and no invertion!), eg. '''Adam je důma?''' (''Is Adam at home?''). When we ask with an interrogative pronoun (we already know 3 of them - '''co''', '''jak''' and '''kaj''') it stands at the beginning, eg. '''Co to je?''' (''What's that?'').

=== Gender of nouns ===
Nouns in Silesian are divided into three groups: masculine, feminine and neuter. The generalized rule is that:

* Masculine nouns are ended with a consonant, eg. '''dům''' (''a house'').
* Feminine nouns are ended with '''-a''', eg. '''dźouška''' ('' a girl'').
* Neuter nouns are ended with '''-o''' or '''-e''', eg. '''mjasto''' (''a city'').

Unlike in English, speaking eg. about a school (''šula'') we use a pronoun '''uůna''' (she).

Pay attention that in Silesian there are no articles like ''a'', ''an'', ''the''. So &quot;the school&quot; and &quot;a school&quot; is just '''šula'''.

=== The third person - personal pronouns and conjugation of verb &quot;to be&quot; ===
Let's sum up the information from the text in this small chart.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!English
!Silesian
!English
!Silesian
|-
|He '''is'''
|Uůn '''je'''
|He '''isn't'''
|Uůn '''ńy je'''
|-
|She '''is'''
|Uůna '''je'''
|She '''isn't'''
|Uůna '''ńy je'''
|-
|It '''is'''
|Uůno '''je'''
|It '''isn't'''
|Uůno '''ńy je'''
|-
|They (''m'') '''are'''
|Uůńi '''sům'''
|They (''m'') '''aren't'''
|Uůńi '''ńy sům'''
|-
|They (''f'') '''are'''
|Uůne '''sům'''
|They (''f'') '''aren't'''
|Uůne '''ńy sům'''
|}

The pronoun '''uůńi''' is used also for mixed-sex group.

=== Tyn, ta, to ===
In this lesson you have learned three demonstrative pronouns: '''tyn''', '''ta''' and '''to'''. The first one is used only befor the masculine nouns and precise the subject. The same thing is with '''ta''', but this pronouns works befor the feminine noun. '''To''' can function similarly before the neuter noun or... be a subject. Saying '''To je sam''' (''This is here'') we may speak about something masculine, feminine, neutral or even about a group of things.
== Exercises ==
1. '''Which of these nouns is macsculine, which is feminine and which is neuter?'''
{|
| dům
| godka
|-
| šula
| mjasto
|-
| państwo
| půn
|-
| půńi
| winkel
|-
| Ślůnsk
| čowjek
|}

2. '''Complete with the demonstrative pronouns.'''
&lt;poem&gt;
a) ... synek
b) ... šula
c) ... půńi
d) ... Ślůnsk
e) ... mjasto
f) ... je daleko.
g) ... godka
h) ... państwo
&lt;/poem&gt;
3. '''Translate into Silesian.'''

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f3f3f3; border: solid 1px #aaaaaa; padding: 6pt; margin: 1em auto; width: 50%&quot;&gt;
Mr. Nowak is at home and Mrs. Nowak isn't. This house is very far away. It is in a city. And where is this city? It's there. Is there a school? Yes, but the school is also here, at the corner.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is  designed specially for users who study Mandarin Chinese with the Pimsleur audio program. It is not a textbook for the program but a collection of information that might come in handy for Pimsleur students, like a systematic grammar overview (which the audio program does not provide).

Another goal is to provide some access to written Chinese (simplified Chinese) resp. to the Pinyin system. Since most Chinese are not really familiar with the Pinyin romanization, it cannot be used in written communication. Still, even for students who decide not to spend time to study the Chinese writing, it is highly recommendable to acquire knowledge of the Pinyin writing. At some point, every student needs to go beyond the vocabulary and the grammar that the Pimsleur program provides, and look up information in a dictionary or textbook. Without knowledge of at least the Pinyin writing, this is hardly possible.

I saw your request to [[User:SB Johnny]] to correct your English, and thought maybe I could help you instead. Your English is pretty good! I made a few modifications that help the flow.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:39, 14 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

|}

=== Automatic Uninstall ===

You can usually uninstall the software satisfactorily by using 

Control Panel -&gt; Add/Remove Programs (Windows XP / 2000)

Control Panel -&gt; Programs -&gt; Uninstall Software (Windows Vista)

Choose the 'Question Writer 4' entry and the software will be uninstalled.

=== Manual File Deletion ===
You should always try to automatically uninstall the software first when removing the software. Following that, you can also try to manually delete all the files associated with Question Writer.

You'll need to choose your system setting 'Show Hidden Files And Folders / System Files'. There are steps on how to do that here
http://www.xtra.co.nz/help/0,,4155-1916458,00.html

Remove the following directories from your file system -

'''C:\Program Files\Question Writer 4'''

'''C:\Program Files\Question Writer 4 Basic'''

(Windows 2000 / Windows XP)

'''C:\Documents and Settings\Your Name\Local Settings\Application Data\Central Question Ltd'''

(Windows Vista)

'''C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Local\Central Question Ltd'''

Replace 'Your Name' with your user name or the profile name with which Question Writer was installed.

How a phase aligner compensates the initial phase step. The simple architecture of the PLL (first order, type one) generates a simple exponential decay of the phase error, witha time constant set by the attenuation in the feedback block.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Practically all motion based problems are directly derived from Newton’s Law’s of Motion, and Mechanical Vibration is no exception. In fact, after applying these equations under basic differential equations we have the basis of all that this text book will cover; albeit with increasing complexity and focus on specifics. Based on observation of experiments, in a vibrational model we notice that the acceleration the body experiences is always in the direction of the applied force. We can then surmise in accord with a standard convention of sign an equation relating force and acceleration vectorally. This is none of than Newton’s famous second law of motion:


:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}= m \mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;


Bold notion indicates that the variable is a vector. This equation correlates to the physical embodiment of a force of 1 N equivalent to a mass of 1 kg accelerating at 1 m/sec^2

By manipulating this equation we can bring forth other useful vibrational relationships. Earlier in this chapter ''Inertia'' was briefly mentioned as the property of matter which acts as a resistance to a change in the bodies momentum; this is explained as a body which has a mass ''m'' having a change in velocity. The change in momentum per unit time is related to the acceleration of the body and is represented equationally by:


:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}= m \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\ \sum{\mathbf{F}} = {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p} \over \mathrm{d}t} = m{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v} \over \mathrm{d}t} = m\mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;


This can be seen as a direct relation to Newton's Second Law of Motion:


:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}= m \mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;


We will now move along to understand Hooke's Law which is defined as the amount which a material body is deformed (or in the case of our supposed springs, deformation of the spring; strain) is linearly related to the force that is causing the deformation (the stress). It is an approximation of the bodies elasticity. The stiffness constant is expressed in units of force per unit length and assumes spring displacement is measured from the initial resting length of the spring. This is shown in the following equation as:


:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}=-k\mathbf{x} \ &lt;/math&gt;


There do exist more complex nonlinear relations for the spring model under Hooke's Law but they will not be used for our vibrational modeling purposes.

== Use Northern Cemetery example of careful process ==


Did prototype and then started to implement but realised still needed to do design
Stable platform
Prototypes basis for communication with client

“Prototyping was undertaken, and initially began by making up some rough web pages in Macromedia Dreamweaver, investigating possible layouts for pages such as the home page and the burial details of an individual.  While these pages focused on layout, colours were just randomly chosen when the colour schemes that the client had expressed interest in could have been included instead.
After meeting and having some heated discussion surrounding this issue, the group reached the conclusion that this method of prototyping was not going to work and that a more structured approach was needed”.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Adfexemplar | Worked example for Sustainable Habitat Challenge |Software Engineering 2007 |

In 2007 Software Engineering worked on developing the information infrastructure for a nation wide sustainable house building challenge (&quot;Shac&quot;). 

In this variant on the planning game we collected together everything we had on the project (knowledge base, system metaphor, stories, data models etc).  We photocopied everything and cut it up into little strips of paper (&quot;cards&quot;).  We then arranged these on a whiteboard according to functional groupings. 

[[Image:planning1.jpg |400px]]

[[Image:Planning2.jpg |400px]]

After a while, it became apparent that our groupings were not conveying the whole of the Shac process, so we added a timeline, and used this to arrange the cards.  This helped to make it clear that we were not doing the Shac process, but rather supporting other people who were doing it.   This changed the focus to concentrating on what users were trying to achieve rather than what they were doing with our system.

This planning game formed the basis for the functional requirements.  The first requirement applied to all others:

All functions must have an underlying approach of &quot;encouraging sustainable behaviour&quot;.   All functions must include the basis of facilitating public engagement in the process and sustainability. 

The system shall provide an integrated (financial and environmental) budgeting and reporting system for teams 
* Integrated means financial and environmental
* The system should support teams throughout the entire entry, design and build process

The system shall provide a means to generate integrated sustainable building calculators.

The system shall provide a dynamic timeline structure to support teams and Shac administration in project management.

The system shall provide an engaging and interactive game of sustainable building choices.
* the purpose of this element is to educate children (8-15) about the sustainability, building choices and to raise awareness of Shac09.  The game should, mirror sustainability decisions etc in the actual Shac09 process, and to this end should as far as possible make use of actual sustainability calculators.

The system shall provide for progress reporting.
* a generic and configurable milestone reporting system has several special cases: entry, design submission, judging submission.

The system shall provide for a collaborative competition structure. 
* Submitted entries (at all phases) will be remotely presented to judges who will remotely confer and give feedback and make decisions.
* Incorporate all evidence submitted to be considered, including designs, team blogs, and information submitted to sustainability budgets etc.
* Support for appeals etc.
* A system of public voting. 

The system shall provide at least three calculators for determining the impact of design options.  
* Each calculator should work from the same base information
* Calculators should integrate ecological footprint, embedded energy, lifetime energy, cost, and social factors.
* The system should take into account the geographic location of the dwelling.

The system shall incorporate interactive 3D representation of builds at all stages of process. 

The system shall provide user and group management functions.
The system shall provide content management functions, including: news; individual and group blogs and webpages; resource links; content approval; guest book; incorporating all media; file sharing; templates. 
The system shall provide communication between all users.
	- intra and inter-group communication
	- including formal and tracked conversations between teams and judges
	- closed discussions within particular groups

==Epidemiology==
*0.5% intracranial neoplasms
*10-20% intracranial neoplasms in &lt;1 y/o
*70% of choroid plexus tumors occur in pts &lt;2 y/o

==Histology==
*Choroid plexus papillomas are WHO grade I.
*Choroid plexus carcinomas are WHO grade III.
*80% of choroid plexus tumrs are papillomas.

==Patterns of Spread==
*Most common site is 4th ventricle.
*As high as 44% of choroid plexus carcinomas can have CSF seeding.
*CSF seeding rare for choroid plexus papilloma.

==Treatment==
===Surgical Excision===
*'''Johns Hopkins, 2002'''  (1985-2000) PMID 12125972 -- &quot;Is there a requirement for adjuvant therapy for choroid plexus carcinoma that has been completely resected?&quot; (Fitzpatrick et al., J Neurooncol. 2002; 57(2):123-6.)
**75 cases of choroid plexus carcinoma described in literature. 37 had GTR, 38 had STR
**84% survival if GTR vs 18% if STR
**Long term survival was seen in pts who received GTR and no further tx; numbers were small.

===Adjuvant Radiotherapy===
*'''Indications for adjuvant RT'''
**positive margins
**positive neuraxis staging
**WHO grade III

*'''Indications for CSI'''
**positive margins
**positive neuraxis staging

===Deferred Radiation in Young Children===
*'''Baby POG I''' (1986-90)
**Prospective. 198 children &lt; 3 yrs (132 &lt; 2 yrs, 66 age 2-3 yrs), bx proven malignant brain tumors (low-grade astro excluded), treated with maximal surgery, postop chemo (CTX/VCR followed by cis/etopo) for 2 yrs (if age &lt; 2 at dx) or 1 yr (age 2-3) or until disease progression, followed by RT. 
**Histologies: 8 pts w/ choroid plexus tumors included in Baby POG I
**'''1993''' PMID 8388548 -- &quot;Postoperative chemotherapy and delayed radiation in children less than three years of age with malignant brain tumors.&quot;  (Duffner et al., N Engl J Med.  1993; 328(24):1725-31)
***CR to chemo PFS comparable those with GTR PFS
**'''1995''' PMID 7619719 -- &quot;Postoperative chemotherapy and delayed radiation in infants and very young children with choroid plexus carcinomas. The Pediatric Oncology Group.&quot;  (Duffner et al., Pediatr Neurosurg. 1995; 22(4):189-96.)
***8 pts w/ choroid plexus carcinoma tx'd w/ surg, prolonged chemo, delayed RT.  
***Results suggest this approach may allow prolonged DFS in young pts.</text>

|Task
|Describe the tasks that people are carrying out
|10 hours
|Functional Requirements
|Completed 
|Discussion with client
|Spiral_section_background_2_dc.gif |thumb]]
}}

Tasks are what happens to functional requirements when you mix them with people.   For each we carry out an analysis of that task.   It is important that the descriptions are from the point of view of the person, not the computer.  

e.g.: if the task was to brush your teeth, then focus on the sequence of steps, the clean feeling etc, not how bendy the toothbrush is. 

===Analysis checklist===

{|
|Task:||Task number and name - descriptive and concise
|-
|Function(s)||Function(s) being carried out relationship with other tasks
|-
|Viewpoint:||Which user is doing it
|-
|User analysis:||What are the characteristics of the users in this task e.g. Skills experience
|-
|Environment:||In what environment will the task be carried out; Physical - office noise lighting,  Social -stress confidentiality
|-
|Pre-requisite knowledge:||What does the user need to know before carrying out task: may be information e.g. student ID number or skills e.g. training in SMS
|-
|Priority:||high/med/low
|-
|Frequency:||How often is this task carried out by this user group Eg Once a day, twenty times per hour
|-
|Duration:||How long does this task take eg 5 minutes, one hour
|-
|Fragmentation:||Does the task consist of several short tasks or must it be completed in one session? Describe which.
|-
|Independence:||Is the task dependent on other tasks or can it be carried out in isolation from other tasks?
|-
|Task performance criteria:||How can we measure how well the task is being carried out? From human point of view - measurable standards e.g. Size of queues, satisfaction, accuracy of results
|-
|Typical use:||Describe the task, what steps are carried out (bullet points)
Make sure this is from the point of the user. Avoid specific reference to computer terms.
|-
|Variants:||List of variations on the task - user error, change mind, machine eats EFTPOS card
|-
|Associated tasks:||List very similar tasks by number and name same task - different user group same task - different environment
|-
|}

===Worked example===


{|
|Task:|| Enroll student 
|-
|Function(s)||Function Student enrollment carried out at Customer Services, student at desk.
|-
|Viewpoint:|| Customer Services staff member
|-
|User analysis:|| Trained and experienced in use of SMS, confident computer user,good customer skills.
|-
|Environment:|| Front desk reception, good lighting and layout.  Could be busy, noisy, pressured for time.  Dealing with confidential information at times. 
|-
|Pre-requisite knowledge:|| Student needs to be already entered in SMS (contacts task), POS complete and signed, user trained in SMS 
|-
|Priority:|| med - varies with peak times, impt to be efficient if student is waiting for enrollment.
|-
|Frequency:|| Very frequent but varies with time of semester, time of day.  10 per hour in first week of term.
|-
|Duration:|| 5-10 minutes 
|-
|Fragmentation:|| Several stages involved, data can be saved at any point and enrollment completed later. All data from enrollment form needs to be entered for completion.
|-
|Independence:|| Dependent on contacts task.  Can be completed at same session.
|-
|Task performance criteria:|| Speed of processing, feedback from students, feedback from departments, backlog of enrollments not processed. Error free.
|-
|From human point of view - measurable standards|| e.g. Size of queues, satisfaction, accuracy of results
|-
|Typical use:
|| 
- collect information from student 

- find student in SMS

- enter details from enrollment form

- enter details from POS form

- check validation 

- Visa, birth certificate etc

- complete enrollment

- print docs for student 
|-
|Variants:|| information incomplete - no validation, student not in system, student data not matched to system data
|-
|Associated tasks:|| enrollment - back office - student not present
online enrollment process
|-

===Familtrac====
FAMILTRACK


From the start our team wanted to include the client as much as we could in the development process.  There is a risk that the client will not follow the development process.  This could result in a misalignment of concepts ideas.  We thought this would reduce the possible risks involved.  To address this problem we implemented design and testing of the interface with the client.  Some mock-ups wire frames were created.  A simple web site was created to demonstrate the interactivity and actions of the application.  This was received well by the client and actually brought about a redefinition of the application’s focus.  A few of the interfaces were developed with the clients input.  Looking back this was a very demonstrated to me when another project group was having difficulty with their client.  The client was expecting something different from what was presented.  It is important to test early and then test some more.

Project Approvals:
Aug 2001:
Project stage one and two signed off on behalf of Dunedin Visitor Centre and IT3

May 2002:
There was agreement on the FamilTrack interface after an interview with the client on 27 May 2002.  The client was shown the wire-frame web interface and the paper based wire-frames.

September 2002:
The Familtrack prototype was shown to the client prior to used testing.  The application was installed at the Visitor Centre while user testing was being completed.   This was an opportunity for the client to inspect the application.

Interviews:
Monday, 27 May 2002

Discuss wire frames:
•	communicate plan
•	approve designs
•	assess changes

Findings:
•	ideas were discussed
•	wire frame designs were discussed

Approve designs:
•	client approved designs

Assess changes:
•	client communicated a change my understanding of the goals of the users when the data was extracted from the system
•	Focus on grouping by regions for information input
•	Focus on the familiarisation tour during input.

Interface Design
Interface design terms of reference
The interface design appendix shows the development of the FamilTrack interface.

Procedure
The look and feel of the FamilTrack was designed and tested with users prior to implementation.  The following steps were followed:

•	Concepts and ideas developed on paper.  A brainstorming technique was combined with group discussion.
•	Paper based wire frames were developed.
•	Web based interface if wire frames was created. This was tested with 2 users and the client.

Design Steps – concepts and ideas
This consisted of discussion of the project with different groups:

•	Discussion of concepts and development ideas within the team
•	Discussion of project with other students and lecturers
•	Discussion with the team mentor, Andrew Sewell
•	Interview with the client (Interview 1 &amp; 2)

 

Paper based wire frames

      <text xml:space="preserve">Each time you meet you should have a &quot;stand up meeting&quot; using the scrum questions.  
Every week you should have a scrum meeting (the same but take a bit longer).
At the end of every sector you should have a review meeting.  This would usually include the client.

You are expected to have considered group management issues.  We suggest that you use the BPP given in software engineering as a template.

    * Management issues
          o You should consider (and write down) how your project is to be managed.  This should include factors such as:
                + Risk management, quality assurance etc. as required by you adopted methodology.
                + Do you require any ethical  (etc.) approval?
                + What mechanism will you use to review your methodology?
                + What will happen if a group member leaves?
                + Are there likely to be any special hardware/software requirements?
                + What will happen if the client loses interest?
                + How should marks be allocated amongst the group?
                + Any special resources required? What are the contingencies if these don't happen?

School children visit the Marine Studies Centre, but often have trouble retaining their knowledge once they go back to school. Children are taught by the Marine Studies Centre educator, Steve Cutler. They are involved in a hands-on learning experience where they are taught an area of Marine Science appropriate to their age. Content is matched to the NZQA curriculum achievement objectives for each level. The majority of learning materials are currently paper based.
The planned CD will benefit the business by providing the teachers with a learning aid to help reinforce children’s learning. A CD will benefit the Marine Studies Centre by enhancing their professional image and extending their Marine Science programme into the school classroom. This will help all those involved to interact with modern technology and learning methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On at least four occasions throughout the project we we perform peer testing (see positive Tasmanian experience).  In given sessions every group will present their work to date to a &quot;review group&quot; who will test and comment on that work.   The review groups will be allocated by Sam and contain one member from the producing group an &quot;author&quot; who will present the work for 5 minutes and then the rest of the group will review the work using a worksheet provided.  This review does not count towards assessment for IT301 but participation is compulsory.

 

The &quot;author&quot; from each group will present information to their review group who will critique it for you (template review form)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vivendi announced that the merger between Activision and Vivendi Games to form a new company under the name of Activision Blizzard has been finalized.


VIVENDI AND ACTIVISION COMPLETE TRANSACTION TO CREATE ACTIVISION BLIZZARD

World's Most Profitable Pure-Play Online and Console Game Publisher

Cash Tender Offer for Up to 146.5 Million of Activision Blizzard Shares at 27.50 per Share to Commence Within Five Business Days

Vivendi owns 52% on a Fully Diluted Basis/54% of Outstanding Shares of Activision Blizzard


July 10, 2008. Paris, France and Santa Monica, CA. Vivendi (Euronext Paris: VIV) and Activision, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI) today announced the completion of the transaction announced on December 2, 2007 to create Activision Blizzard, as the world's most profitable pure-play online and console game publisher. Activision Blizzard was formed by combining Activision, one of the world's leading independent publishers of interactive entertainment, and Vivendi Games, Vivendi's interactive entertainment business, which includes Blizzard Entertainment's® World of Warcraft®, the world's #1 subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Activision Blizzard will continue to operate as a public company traded on Nasdaq under the ticker ATVI.

Jean Bernard Levy, CEO of Vivendi, said: &quot;We have created the world leader in online and console games with this transaction and the combined strengths of the two businesses offer immense growth potential. I am also very confident that, with the new leadership team in place, the new entity is perfectly positioned to take advantage of these rapidly developing markets across the globe.&quot;

Rene Penisson, Chairman of Activision Blizzard, added: &quot;We are delighted that the merger has been completed. We are very excited about the opportunity for Activision Blizzard to create a broader entertainment software platform. We are leaders across North America and Europe and are creating a substantial footprint in the rapidly growing Asian market. We are determined to 'think big'!&quot;

&quot;The completion of this transaction marks the beginning of an important new chapter in the history of interactive entertainment,&quot; said Robert Kotick, President and Chief Executive Officer of Activision Blizzard. &quot;By combining leaders in mass-market entertainment and subscription-based online games, Activision Blizzard has leading market positions across all categories of the rapidly growing interactive entertainment software industry. With more than 10.7 million subscribers on World of Warcraft, and with tens of millions of people playing Guitar Hero, Activision Blizzard's games are transcending the traditional stereotypes and are more popular as a form of entertainment than ever before. We look forward to building upon our brands to create value for our shareholders, customers and consumers.&quot;





&quot;From the beginning, our goal has been to make the best games in the world, and this transaction strengthens our ability to do just that,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, Blizzard Entertainment cofounder and Chief Executive Officer. &quot;As part of Activision Blizzard we'll have the reach and resources to share our games with an even wider audience while maintaining the same approach as always to providing high-quality entertainment and services to our players.&quot;

In addition to World of Warcraft, the #1 subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game, the transaction brings together some of the world's leading interactive entertainment franchises including Guitar Hero®, the #1 family entertainment and #1 music-based franchise; Call of Duty®, the #1 first-person action franchise; Tony Hawk, the #1 action sports franchise; Spider-Man, the #1 Super Hero franchise; Cabela's, the #1 sports hunting franchise; and two of the top-ten kids movie-based franchises, Shrek and Madagascar™, for calendar year 2005 through 2007 according to the NPD Group, Chart Track and The GFK Group.

The transaction was approved by Activision's stockholders at a special stockholder meeting on July 8, 2008 and closed on July 9, 2008.

What are the characteristics of a successful capstone project?

A combination of a good team and strong methodology combined with creativity and technical skills produced a solution that exceeded all expectations. 

A strong relationship with a client is critical to the success of a project.  This was the first project we undertook with the Museum, but has led to many more. 

The Otago Museum was established in 1868 and is the key culture and heritage organisation for the Otago region.  With a collection of over 1.7 million items, the Otago Museum is one of the four largest museums in New Zealand.    With a long term duty of care responsibility, the vast majority of these items are in storage but this does not sit freely with a mission statement including “to inspire and enrich our community, and enhance understanding...”.  A solution for this contradiction was the challenge set for this project group in 2002. [[Image:Moas-montage.jpg |thumb]]

[[Image:Moas_kiwi.jpg |400px |left]] 

The Museum had previous experience with 3D capture of artifacts but it was prohibitively expensive and performed on a individual piece basis.   The solution is essentially a 3D capture and display system.   Although the turntable was the most visible part, the true strength of the project was the fact that an integrated system  was produced.   To reduce the effort and time required for each object to a matter of seconds, required an integrated yet modular system.   The solution is not “rocket science”, the only real novel solution is an optical switch to control the camera,  yet, as Loudon (2001) argued, sometimes it is the robust and creative application of old ideas in a new way that provides innovation.  
  
[[Image:Moas_timeline.png|400px |left]] With this project we pioneered the Agile Development Approach.  In the case of the hardware system this was seen is several stages.  The initial testing was on a converted record player, the test items chosen to reflect difficult artefacts (a shiny pink pig and a rock with almost indiscernible striations). 

[[Image:Moas2.jpg |thumb]] 

A virtual prototype was used to establish design parameters for lighting and focal arrangements.  The first production prototype was used in the client’s environment before the production version of the turntable was manufactured to industrial specifications.  The timeline of the project demonstrates the importance of combining agility with a structured methodology and clearly identified deliverables and milestones. 

Prototyping was also used in the development of the software applications, to both test development approaches and as a communication tool for the clients.  These were, in the main, revolutionary rather than evolutionary prototypes although the strict coding standards applied by the group meant that even early prototypes were relatively robust. [[Image:Moas-prototype.jpg |thumb]] 

[[Image:Moas_inside.jpg |thumb]]

The museum project (described in more detail in Garrett et al. 2003) aimed to provide a solution for the Otago Museum.  This was a complex project that aimed to resolve the differences between two high level goals of the museum – the long term storage of artefacts that conflicts with the public education imperative.  The group developed an automated system that captures 3D objects and displays them on the web. 

The group performed extensive prototyping and testing as part of a carefully managed development plan.  
A functional prototype involving hardware and software, along with a great deal of ‘sellotape’ was developed as part of analysis.  Despite considerable frailties and faked components this was tested at the Museum in order to demonstrate the worth and feasibility of a system as described by the functional requirements.  Following a revolutionary pattern the group developed several hardware and software prototypes, each of which they extensively tested at the museum.   Doing this enabled the group to perfect the process before automating each step.  The group’s reflective review describes the excitement of capturing a first museum object (a moa bone), a tiny object (a weta) and a huge object (a stuffed tiger).
Three months before the end of the project the group was able to begin the construction of a production system.  This they did to perfection, both the software and hardware systems were extremely well engineered: elegant and commented code and bullet-proof and redundant hardware systems.  This system was installed and in production in the museum a month before hand in date.


The finished system has several software components to capture, manipulate, store and present both the 3D artefacts and a virtual tour of the Museum.   This was achieved by the development of an intranet style application that integrates MOAS components (capture, management, and database) and their output (36 images).  The interface that fits with the existing Otago Museum website, logos and other publications and is designed for a broad audience.  The database supports an unlimited amount of object categories with unlimited levels of hierarchy and is presented in a way that allows users to easily navigate large numbers of objects and to interact and manipulate the digital objects.  Using SQL and Active Server Pages the system implements recursive queries to manage large taxonomy of object categories and  generates dynamic and complex search queries based on many different object attributes.   An object viewer was developed and implemented in JavaScript with additional Visual Basic Code to watermark the images.   The object viewer includes a pre-loader, zoom controls, rotation controls, pan controls and toggle rotation controls. 

[[Image:MoasWeta.jpg |thumb]]

This project was an outstanding success, and continues to be so.   Fincher et al. (2001) state the importance of finding good clients, providing a real service to the clients but of the client’s having realistic expectations.   In this project we could not have wished for better clients, and, at the time of delivery the client was very pleased, the project “exceeded expectations”.   All four students graduated with the “Award for Excellence the B.InfoTech”. 
[[Image:Moas-group.jpg |thumb]]

The project also managed to achieve the additional benefit of creating significant exposure for both institutions. 

Perhaps the most important factor of all is the group itself.  They operated in a cohesive unit while assigning individual responsibilities and showing much individual flair.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The simplest structures on which we can study operations of both &quot;algebra&quot; and &quot;calculus&quot; is the [[w:Banach space|Banach space]]. The crucial importance of Hilbert Spaces in Physics is due to the fact that the not only are Hilbert Spaces a special case of Banach space, but also because they contain the idea of inner product and the related conjugate-symmetry.  
(This chapter requires some familiarity with basic [[Measure Theory|measure theory]])

==Inner Product==
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; (here, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; stands either for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;). The binary operation &lt;math&gt;(\cdot):V\times V\to F&lt;/math&gt; is said to define an '''inner product''' if and only if,

For all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a,b\in F&lt;/math&gt;

(i)  (Conjugate Symmetry): &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{y})=\overline{(\mathbf{y}\cdot \mathbf{x})}&lt;/math&gt;

:This implies that &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{x})\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{x})=\overline{(\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{x})}&lt;/math&gt;

(ii) (Linearity in first variable): &lt;math&gt;(a\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{y})=a(\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{y})&lt;/math&gt;

:Conjugate symmetry implies that &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}\cdot b\mathbf{y})=\overline{(b\mathbf{y}\cdot \mathbf{x})}=\overline{b(\mathbf{y}\cdot \mathbf{x})}=\overline{b}(x\cdot y)&lt;/math&gt;

(iii) (Positivity): &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{x})\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\in V&lt;/math&gt;

(iv) (Definiteness): &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{x})=0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;

If an inner product is defined on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, we say that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an inner product space. 

The complex-conjugate is sometimes denoted as &lt;math&gt;\overline{z}=z^*&lt;/math&gt;
==Hilbert Space==
Observe that the positive-definite nature of the inner product implies that we can define a [[w:Normed vector space|norm]] on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\forall\mathbf{x}\in V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{x}\|=(\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is [[w:complete_space|complete]] under this norm, we say that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a '''Hilbert Space'''.

Thus a Hilbert space is a ''complete inner product'' space.

===Examples===
In the examples of Hilbert spaces given below, the underlying field of scalars is the complex numbers '''C''', although similar definitions apply to the case in which the underlying field of scalars is the real numbers '''R'''.

====Euclidean spaces ====
Every finite-dimensional inner product space is also a Hilbert space. For example, '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the inner product defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle = \sum_{k=1}^n x_k\overline{y_k}&lt;/math&gt; 
where the bar over a complex number denotes its complex conjugate.

====Sequence spaces====
Given a set ''B'', the sequence space &lt;math&gt;\ell^2&lt;/math&gt; (commonly pronounced &quot;little ell two&quot;) over ''B'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; \ell^2(B) =\big\{ x : B \xrightarrow{x} \mathbb{C} \text{ and } \sum_{b \in B} \left|x \left(b\right)\right|^2 &lt; \infty \big\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This space becomes a Hilbert space with the inner product
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle = \sum_{b \in B} x(b)\overline{y(b)}&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' and ''y'' in &lt;math&gt;\ell^2(B)&lt;/math&gt;.
''B'' does not have to be a countable set in this definition, although if ''B'' is not countable, the resulting Hilbert space is not separable. Every Hilbert space is isomorphic to one of the form &lt;math&gt;\ell^2(B)&lt;/math&gt; for a suitable set ''B''.  If ''B''='''N''', the natural numbers, this space is separable and is simply called &lt;math&gt;\ell^2&lt;/math&gt;.

====New Hilbert spaces from old====
Two (or more) Hilbert spaces can be combined to produce another Hilbert space by taking either their direct sum or their tensor product.

===Square-integrable functions===
Among examples of Hilbert spaces, the one that holds the most interest for the physicists are the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^2&lt;/math&gt; spaces.

Consider &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^2&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of all functions &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; that are ''square integrable'' with respect to a real measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \|f\|^2 d\mu&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined.

Define inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^2&lt;/math&gt; as

&lt;math&gt;(f*g)=\int_a^b f(x)^*g(x)d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Provided the inner product exists for any pair of functions &lt;math&gt;f,g&lt;/math&gt;, we can see that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^2&lt;/math&gt; is an inner product space.

The reader may notice an ambiguity here, as &lt;math&gt;(f*g)=(f*g')&lt;/math&gt; need not imply that &lt;math&gt;g=g'&lt;/math&gt;. To resolve this, we use a different equivalence relation between functions, &lt;math&gt;f\sim f'\Leftrightarrow \int_a^b \|f-f'\|d\mu=0&lt;/math&gt;, and hence, &lt;math&gt;f=f'&lt;/math&gt; at all points of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; except for a set of points of measure &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

The &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^2&lt;/math&gt; space is an example of what are called the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^p&lt;/math&gt; spaces. It can be shown([http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=6270]) that all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^p&lt;/math&gt; spaces are complete, and hence, the Lebesgue space, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^2&lt;/math&gt; is also complete.

Thus, we have that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^2&lt;/math&gt; is a Hilbert space. 

Let us identify &lt;math&gt;\psi\in\mathcal{L}^2&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\left|\psi \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and denote the inner product of &lt;math&gt;\psi,\phi\in\mathcal{L}^2&lt;/math&gt; as 

&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\phi|\psi\right\rangle=\int_a^b \phi^*(x)\psi(x)d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

The reader with previous experience in quantum mechanics will be able to recognise this as a formal justification for the [[w:dirac notation|dirac notation]].

{{Adfexemplar | Information mapping | Paul van Tuel, Steven Turnbull |

The understanding of an extremely complex system was needed for this group to develop a system to support the post production pathway for a television company.  As part of SDLC analysis the group developed many complex and detailed DFDs.  In an interesting twist, these DFDs became the prototype for communication with the client, the basis of detailed functional requirements and eventually the operational deliverable.

Once the group established that the system was to be a hierarchical diagram system, they put together a program that generated dynamic diagrams from a database.  This stable platform meant the group could concentrate on design and interactivity and develop separate prototypes in each stage as part of a testing regime.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For many projects, the content of the software is beyond the scope of the IT project team.  It is not a sensible use of an IT professional's skills to to typing up recipes to fill a cooking database.  Hence, we try to focus on developing content management systems rather than &quot;websites&quot;.  But there are significant exceptions to this rule:

* when the data itself has significant IT complexity.  

* when the content is integral to the software - that is, cannot be separately considered as &quot;the stuff someone else will put in later&quot;.

===Case studies ===

{{Adfexemplar | Hospitality training CD |Dave Ponting, Luke Quarrie, Georgina Robertson for Etrusco Restaurant and Otago Polytechnic Hospitality  |

Etrusco at the Savoy is a restaurant in Dunedin with exacting standards of presentation and service. Working with Fred &amp; Meegan Gianone and Otago Polytechnic School of Hospitality. This project group has developed an interactive CD to meet the training needs of the business. Fred &amp; Meegan described it as a &quot;fantastic effort&quot;.  These images show the development of the content from orginal wireframes to finished product.

[[Image:Etrusco_front.png |400px]]
[[Image:Etrusco_reservation.jpg | 400px]]



The group produced paper based prototypes early as part of requirements determination.  In discussion with the client they were not looking for comments on font, image – but rather what are the functions the client would like.    They then mocked up the whole system and were able to test this with the client and their staff in detail.  The final system was similarly extensively tested. 

The group used an iterative approach to create the content management system and then produced each component of the content in turn in a modular fashion.  This approach to always having a working product is a very sensible implementation plan.

{{Adfexemplar | Marine Quest- Crab feeding utensils | Alastair Nicholl, Liz Coup and Janey Labes for Portobello Aquarium |

The group received funding for an artist to implement their wireframes and specifications.  Here we follow the group's development of a particular game: Crab feeding utensils.

[[Image:Adfcrab8.jpg|400px]]

Our first prototype is referring to the paperbased game that the Marine Studies Centre currently uses. We thought it would be a good candidate to be digitalised on the computer.   The client provided us with a paper-based  version of this game. After contact with the client during iteration 1, we established that this was an important concept for children to understand (as several of the Marine Studies Centre programmes focussed on food chains).

[[Image:AdfCrab2.jpg‎ |400px]]
[[Image:Adfcrab3.jpg|400px]] 

These are from the first detailed storyboards that we completed for Crab Feeding Utensils. We decided to present the user with a choice of crabs. When a crab was clicked, a close up image of the crab would appear with a choice of utensils at the side of the screen. To make the game more interesting and increase “replayability”, we added additional utensils that were not matched to any crab and made the choices random each time the game was played.

A clue would appear below the crab image to help the user identify the correct utensil. Content was taken from the existing paper-based resources. If the user selected the wrong utensil, they would receive feedback in the form of a sound effect and the utensil returning to the side of the screen and being disabled. When the user chose the correct utensil, the feedback would include sound effects and an animation of the crab feeding. An idea was proposed that the animation could include the crab “using” the actual kitchen utensil, followed by the realistic feeding motion. This idea was later discarded as it was not educational.

[[Image:Adfcrab4.jpg |400px]]

This was the flash game built. This version focuses on core game functionality rather than accurate artwork. Images are used as placeholders.  

[[Image:Adfcrab5.jpg|400px]] 
This is the version we created after we had received the Main Menu from the artist. In this version we had clues to help the user, and the kitchen utensils were random.  When we initially showed the client this it was hard to get across that the images were just place holders, and that they will be replaced by the artist.

[[Image:Adfcrab6.jpg|400px]]

In this version we had a robust game, and in future versions all that has changed is feedback and interface design. Key features of this version: The utensil bar changed from horizontal to vertical to make more room for the feedback, Clues added, Treasure functionality, Random utensils, An anchor over the crabs to let the user know that they got it right.

[[Image:Adfcrab7.jpg|400px]] 
In this final version we added additional feed back when the user got the correct utensil. This was result of observations during user testing - most user did not realize that they had got it right and that the crab was feeding. A few kids even thought that the shrimp was dancing.

{{Adfexemplar |Talking with Leonardo | Chrissie Jackson and Jonathon Ung  for Otago Museum|

The Leonardo Talking Head robot is an interactive robot with a personality. The robot will accept speech and respond back. 

This sequence of images depicts the development of the script.

The first script, recorded by the group to test the interaction. 

[[Image:Leonardo_script1.jpg]]

The group then worked with the client to develop a more complete narrative.

[[Image:Leonardoscript2.jpg]]

The style of the narrative was used in describing the twenty key facts the Museum wished to highlight.

[[Image:Leonardoscript3.jpg]]

[[Image:Leonardoscript4.jpg]]

Each sentence was broken up into sub-sentences and re-written with slightly different words, the sub-sentences to be strung together randomly - giving seemingly different conversations to successive museum visitors, even if they gave the same responses.

{{Adfexemplar | Northern Cemetery| Christine Rout, Daniel Butel, Meikle Skelly  |

This project aimed to provide a resource for a heritage tourism trust.  The project was essentially a dynamic webpage for a cemetery but with several added complications, primary among these the 18,000 historical records to manage.  

The group made a static webpage quite quickly and extensively used several versions of this in communication with the client, from this the group developed the functional requirements.  The client was happy and the group “just needed to make prototype robust”.  They then proceeded to develop the prototype – making dynamic and adding “functions and polish”.  After following this path for about six weeks, the group realised that were heading down a dead end. The approach to development was not working as the client was becoming distracted by details of the prototype (comments on font etc when they were trying to discuss functions), and a realisation that they had missed the logical design steps of task analysis, interactivity design etc.  The group then stopped development of the prototype and then went through logical and physical design properly.   Going back through these stages highlighted assumptions they had made with the prototype, they had assumed an encyclopaedia approach but a story approach focus was much better.  The wireframe designs allowed focus on content.

{{cquote |“Prototyping was undertaken…investigating possible layouts for pages such as the home page and the burial details of an individual.  While these pages focused on layout, colours were just randomly chosen when the colour schemes that the client had expressed interest in could have been included instead… After meeting and having some heated discussion surrounding this issue, the group reached the conclusion that this method of prototyping was not going to work and that a more structured approach was needed”. |||}}

The group realised early on that the system would be a dynamic webpage.  Early in the project (while redoing the logical design) they developed a structure that provided a stable platform for development: a database with read/write/edit that generated webpages in the required language. 

In the third iteration the group developed style guides to determine the look of each page.  From there it was a relatively simple implementation to combine the stable platform and the style guides to produce the finished product.

{{Adfexemplar | Data projector control system | Jim Campbell, Mark Allen and Don Brewer  |


The bane of the presenters life, the projector. How many times have you been in a flash lecture and had a pause in proceedings while the lecturer fumbles with the remote, turns the lights off and accidentally turns the projector off when they meant to advance a slide. This project has developed software and hardware solutions that work with a range of data projectors so that the control of the system is driven by simple icons on the projectors computer. No longer will you have to &quot;talk among yourselves&quot; while a frustrated lecturer runs for a technician. 

The project saw the delivery of a working system in institutional theatres.  This though is only a part of the deliverables.  In addition to the application, commented source code was supplied.  The system was also designed to cater for new and different projectors, with configuration data separately managed.  As part of the delivery the group also ran an extensive training campaign for academics using the new system, including signs and videos. 

[[Image:Adf_projector_Imre.jpg |400px]]

Client satisified: &quot;A real problem with the benefits of a simple solution&quot; , &quot;I was impressed that they were focussed on a simple practical solution. My initial concern was that we would get an expensive prototype but instead I got a production system. I enjoyed the team's enthusiasm…their positive attitude always gave the impression that they would produce a result&quot;

{{Adfexemplar | Timed Lapse | Daniel Himburg and Jade Thomlinson  for Lloyd Godman |

“[http://www.lloydgodman.net/Time/Time7.htm Timed Lapse]” is the result of a collaboration with a photographer, Lloyd Godman. We have worked with Lloyd for six years, developing various exhibition pieces mostly involving plants and light controlled via a computer according to either the state of the plants or the visitors. For an international exhibition “Accelerating Sequence” (at MOCA, Atlanta Georgia), artists were challenged to explore time and aging. Timed Lapse is a combination of plants growing (and dying) while the images of visitors are collected and displayed in an ever increasing time lapse sequence.

The project students didn't get to go to the States.  Instead they had to prepare the exhibit to a stage where Lloyd could set up the work himself.  As he was purchasing much of the equipment remotely, the system had to be designed to be configurable by him.   When a camera failed at the last minute, the project team wrote code and remotely fixed it from a distance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already, in the previous chapter, introduced the concept of matrices as representations for linear transformations. Here, we will deal with them more thoroughly.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a field and let &lt;math&gt;M=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;N=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;. An '''n×m matrix''' is a function &lt;math&gt;A:N\times M\to F&lt;/math&gt;.

We denote &lt;math&gt;A(i,j)=a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can be written as the array of numbers &lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1m} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2m} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3m} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nm} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the set of all n×m matrices defined on a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Let us define ''scalar product'' &lt;math&gt;cA&lt;/math&gt; to be the matrix &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; whose elements are given by &lt;math&gt;b_{ij}=ca_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. Also let ''addition'' of two matrices &lt;math&gt;A+B&lt;/math&gt; be the matrix &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; whose elements are given by &lt;math&gt;c_{ij}=a_{ij}+b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

With these definitions, we can see that the set of all n×m matrices on &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; form a vector space over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;

==Linear Transformations==
Let &lt;math&gt;U,V&lt;/math&gt; be vector spaces over the field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the set of all linear transformations &lt;math&gt;T:U\to V&lt;/math&gt;. 

Define addition of transformations as &lt;math&gt;(T_1+T_2)\mathbf{u}=T_1\mathbf{u}+T_2\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; and scalar product as &lt;math&gt;(cT)\mathbf{u}=c(T\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the set of all linear transformations from &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space. This space is denoted as &lt;math&gt;L(U,V)&lt;/math&gt;.

Observe that &lt;math&gt;L(U,V)&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;mn&lt;/math&gt; dimensional vector space

==Operations on Matrices==
===Determinant===
The '''determinant''' of a matrix is defined iteratively (a determinant can be defined only if the matrix is square). 

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix, its determinant is denoted as &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt;

We define, &lt;math&gt;\left| \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\
\end{pmatrix}\right| =a_{11}a_{22}-a_{21}a_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;n= 3&lt;/math&gt;, we define &lt;math&gt;\left| \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \\
\end{pmatrix}\right|=a_{11}\left| \begin{pmatrix}
a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\
a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \\
\end{pmatrix}\right|-a_{12}\left| \begin{pmatrix}
a_{21} &amp; a_{23} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{33} \\
\end{pmatrix}\right|+a_{13}\left| \begin{pmatrix}
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{32} \\
\end{pmatrix}\right|&lt;/math&gt;

We thus define the determinant for any square matrix

===Trace===
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an n×n (square) matrix with elements &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''trace''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the some of its diagonal elements, that is,

&lt;math&gt;tr(A)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii}&lt;/math&gt;

This is conventionally denoted as &lt;math&gt;tr(A)=\sum_{i,j=1}^na_{ij}\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''Kronecker delta''' is a symbol which you will encounter constantly in this book. It is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij} = \left\{\begin{matrix} 
1, &amp; \mbox{if } i=j   \\ 
0, &amp; \mbox{if } i \ne j   \end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

The Kronecker delta itself denotes the members of an n×n matrix called the '''n×n unit matrix''', denoted as &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;
===Transpose===
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an m×n matrix, with elements &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. The n×m matrix &lt;math&gt;A^T&lt;/math&gt; with elements &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}^T&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''transpose''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;a^T_{ij}=a_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;

==Matrix Product==
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an m×n matrix and let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be an n×p matrix. 

We define the product of &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; to be the m×p matrix &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; whose elements are given by 

&lt;math&gt;c_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; and we write &lt;math&gt;C=AB&lt;/math&gt;

===Properties===
:(i) Product of matrices is not commutative. Indeed, for two matrices &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt;, the product &lt;math&gt;BA&lt;/math&gt; need not be well-defined even though &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as above.

:(ii) For any matrix n×n &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;AI=IA=A&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the n×n unit matrix.

=Petrov's Defence, Damiano Variation=
===4. Qe2===
White threatens the black knight. Qe7 is the usual move, but d5 and d6 are about as good. If the black knight moves immediately, black will lose material.

This position almost only occurs among beginners because this trap is so well known and black's position is terrible.

==What is gNewSense?==

gNewSense is a free GNU/Linux operating system. In this case, free refers to freedom like free speech rather than free beer, which means you're allowed to do the following with gNewSense:

* Use it for any purpose you like
* Distribute copies of gNewSense to any one you want
* Study the source code of gNewSense and understand its working. (This is largely impossible with Windows or OS X)
* Modify gNewSense so that it suits your purposes. (This is largely impossible with Windows or OS X)

==What's so great about gNewSense?==

gNewSense is great as it offers you the four freedoms as stated above. Well you can use Windows or OS X for any purpose you want. People who protect us, like police and army, use them; terrorists use Windows and OS X, too. The good news is that gNewSense can be used for anything, to create, to protect and to destroy. So gNewSense is leveled with competitive operating systems.

Now let's talk about the second point of free software: to distribute it freely to your friends, and possibly enemies to get their good will, to family and loved ones. With gNewSense you can distribute the operating system because it's free(dom). If you distribute Windows or OS X, you will still be happy if you like to count bars behind prison. You will be called a pirate, criminal and possibly enemy of the state.

If the above paragraph shocked you, then we must remind you that we are not kidding. It could happen to you if you use Windows or OS X. So you'd better start using gNewSense or risk facing the cold shoulder of society. In court you could argue that you had purchased Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X for yourself and that you have the right to do anything you want with what you own. Well the bad news is even if you have purchased a copy of a proprietary Operating System, you do not own it.

Microsoft and Apple have the right to control you if you are using their software. Believe it or not it's the awful truth. If you are using proprietary software the software vendor may spy on you, may not release crucial updates in time, may not allow you to modify the operating system because they think its a security breach.

So why did those companies launch and market their operating system? A simple answer is that they think, and have mostly succeeded, in fooling people around. They make you pay for them to shackle you! And that's a fact.

Coming to the third point of free software. You should be able to study the code and understand how it works. Well, for Windows and OS X the source code isn't made available to you. And it's practically difficult and almost impossible in all cases to find out how software works from binary files. Microsoft and Apple don't want you to know how their software works, simply because they are afraid of competition. In gNewSense you can study the source code of the software, find how it works and possibly create your own GNU/Linux distribution, if you are skilled enough.

Now the fourth law of free software, to modify it for your own purpose. gNewSense allows you to modify the software so that it fits your needs. If you try to modify Microsoft's or Apple's software, you will be labeled a criminal and possibly fined millions of dollars and put behind bars.

In short gNewSense is great, so start using it.

==Getting gNewSense CD==

To get gNewsense go to http://cdimage.gnewsense.org/ where you will find the latest CD images. But it's recommended that you download via Bittorrent by going to http://torrent.gnewsense.org/. You can check out various mirrors for gNewSense by visiting 
http://www.gnewsense.org/Mirrors/Mirrors.

If you are using a Windows Operating System, use tools like Free Download Manager or use Bittorrent client. Visit http://www.opendisc.org to get to know about many free programs that you can use on Windows.

Once you have got the CD, you need to burn it. In Windows just click the iso file twice (double click) for it to guide you on burning the CD.

==Booting Up==

Once you have burned the image on to your disk, put it into your computer disk drive and restart your computer. In a short notice you will see a screen like shown

[[Image:GNewSese_boot.png]]

Just press enter. If all goes well you will be able to see gNewSense live user screen as shown below

[[Image:GNewSense_screenshot.png]]

Now you can start playing with 100% free Operating System software.

==Using the Live CD==

==Installing on your PC==
=== Installing on the Yeeloong Laptop of Lemote Tech ===

The aim of the project gNewSenseToMips is to realize the intention of The Free Software Foundation to port the gNewSense distribution (http://www.gnewsense.org/static/homepage/ ) on the Yeeloong laptop (http://www.lemote.com/english/yeeloong.html ) manufactured by Lemote Tech (http://www.lemote.com/ ).

      <comment>/* Ethernet */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This section covers information specific to Ethernet and IP. These subsections have been grouped together because I think they are the most interesting ones in the formerly-called Technology Specific Section. Anyone with a LAN should be able to benefit from these goodies.

== Ethernet == 

Ethernet device names are `eth0', `eth1', `eth2' etc. The first card detected by the kernel is assigned `eth0' and the rest are assigned sequentially in the order they are detected.  
By default, the Linux kernel only probes for one Ethernet device, you need to pass command line arguments to the kernel in order to force detection of further boards.

To learn how to make your ethernet card(s) working under Linux you should refer to the Ethernet-HOWTO.

Once you have your kernel properly built to support your ethernet card then configuration of the card is easy.

Typically you would use something like (which most distributions already do for you, if you configured them to support your ethernet): 
             root# ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
             root# route add -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0

Most of the ethernet drivers were developed by Donald Becker, becker@CESDIS.gsfc.nasa.gov.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== EQL - multiple line traffic equaliser == 

The EQL device name is `eql'. With the standard kernel source you may have only one EQL device per machine. EQL provides a means of utilizing multiple point to point lines such as PPP, slip or plip as a single logical link to carry tcp/ip. Often it is cheaper to use multiple lower speed lines than to have one high speed line installed.

Kernel Compile Options:
             Network device support  ---&gt;
                 [*] Network device support
                 &lt;*&gt; EQL (serial line load balancing) support

To support this mechanism the machine at the other end of the lines must also support EQL. Linux, Livingstone Portmasters and newer dial- in servers support compatible facilities.  

To configure EQL you will need the eql tools which are available from: metalab.unc.edu.

Configuration is fairly straightforward. You start by configuring the eql interface. The eql interface is just like any other network device. You configure the IP address and mtu using the ifconfig utility, so something like:

             root# ifconfig eql 192.168.10.1 mtu 1006

Next you need to manually initiate each of the lines you will use.  These may be any combination of point to point network devices. How you initiate the connections will depend on what sort of link they are, refer to the appropriate sections for further information.  

Lastly you need to associate the serial link with the EQL device, this is called `enslaving' and is done with the eql_enslave command as shown:

        root# eql_enslave eql sl0 28800
        root# eql_enslave eql ppp0 14400

The `estimated speed' parameter you supply eql_enslave doesn't do anything directly. It is used by the EQL driver to determine what share of the datagrams that device should receive, so you can fine tune the balancing of the lines by playing with this value.  
To disassociate a line from an EQL device you use the eql_emancipate command as shown:

             root# eql_emancipate eql sl0

You add routing as you would for any other point to point link, except your routes should refer to the eql device rather than the actual serial devices themselves, typically you would use: 

             root# route add default eql

The EQL driver was developed by Simon Janes, simon@ncm.com.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== IP Accounting (for Linux-2.0) == 

The IP accounting features of the Linux kernel allow you to collect and analyze some network usage data. The data collected comprises the number of packets and the number of bytes accumulated since the figures were last reset. You may specify a variety of rules to categorize the figures to suit whatever purpose you may have. This option has been removed in kernel 2.1.102, because the old ipfwadm- based firewalling was replaced by ``ipfwchains''.

Kernel Compile Options:

             Networking options  ---&gt;
                 [*] IP: accounting

After you have compiled and installed the kernel you need to use the ipfwadm command to configure IP accounting. There are many different ways of breaking down the accounting information that you might choose.  I've picked a simple example of what might be useful to use, you should read the ipfwadm man page for more information.  Scenario: You have a ethernet network that is linked to the internet via a PPP link. On the ethernet you have a machine that offers a number of services and that you are interested in knowing how much traffic is generated by each of  ftp and world wide web traffic, as well as total tcp and udp traffic.

You might use a command set that looks like the following, which is shown as a shell script: 

             #!/bin/sh
             #
             # Flush the accounting rules
             ipfwadm -A -f
             #
             # Set shortcuts
             localnet=44.136.8.96/29
             any=0/0
             # Add rules for local ethernet segment
             ipfwadm -A in  -a -P tcp -D $localnet ftp-data
             ipfwadm -A out -a -P tcp -S $localnet ftp-data
             ipfwadm -A in  -a -P tcp -D $localnet www
             ipfwadm -A out -a -P tcp -S $localnet www
             ipfwadm -A in  -a -P tcp -D $localnet
             ipfwadm -A out -a -P tcp -S $localnet
             ipfwadm -A in  -a -P udp -D $localnet
             ipfwadm -A out -a -P udp -S $localnet
             #
             # Rules for default
             ipfwadm -A in  -a -P tcp -D $any ftp-data
             ipfwadm -A out -a -P tcp -S $any ftp-data
             ipfwadm -A in  -a -P tcp -D $any www
             ipfwadm -A out -a -P tcp -S $any www
             ipfwadm -A in  -a -P tcp -D $any
             ipfwadm -A out -a -P tcp -S $any
             ipfwadm -A in  -a -P udp -D $any
             ipfwadm -A out -a -P udp -S $any
             #
             # List the rules
             ipfwadm -A -l -n
             #

The names ``ftp-data'' and ``www'' refer to lines in /etc/services.  The last command lists each of the Accounting rules and displays the collected totals.  

An important point to note when analyzing IP accounting is that totals for all rules that match will be incremented so that to obtain differential figures you need to perform appropriate maths. For example if I wanted to know how much data was not ftp nor www I would substract the individual totals from the rule that matches all ports.

 root# ipfwadm -A -l -n
 IP accounting rules

The new accounting code is accessed via ``IP Firewall Chains''.  See the IP chains home page for more information.  Among other things, you'll now need to use ipchains instead of ipfwadm to configure your filters. (From Documentation/Changes in the latest kernel sources).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Multiple IP addresses ==

There are some applications where being able to configure multiple IP addresses to a single network device is useful. Internet Service Providers often use this facility to provide a &quot;customized&quot; what to their World Wide Web and ftp offerings for their customers.

For example, assume you have an Ethernet network that supports two different IPv4 subnetworks simultaneously and you wish your machine to have direct access to both, you could use something like: 

 ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth0
 ip addr add 192.168.10.1/24 dev eth0

Adding an address also automatically adds a route to the accompanying network.

To delete an alias, simply replace add by del:

 ip addr del 192.168.10.1/24 dev eth0

All routes associated with that address will also be deleted automatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== IP Firewall (for Linux-2.0) == 

IP Firewall and Firewalling issues are covered in more depth in the Firewall-HOWTO. IP Firewalling allows you to secure your machine against unauthorized network access by filtering or allowing datagrams from or to IP addresses that you nominate. There are three different classes of rules, incoming filtering, outgoing filtering and forwarding filtering. Incoming rules are applied to datagrams that are received by a network device. Outgoing rules are applied to datagrams that are to be transmitted by a network device. Forwarding rules are applied to datagrams that are received and are not for this machine,
ie datagrams that would be routed.

Kernel Compile Options:

             Networking options  ---&gt;
                 [*] Network firewalls
                 ....
                 [*] IP: forwarding/gatewaying
                 ....
                 [*] IP: firewalling
                 [ ] IP: firewall packet logging

Configuration of the IP firewall rules is performed using the ipfwadm command. As I mentioned earlier, security is not something I am expert at, so while I will present an example you can use, you should do your own research and develop your own rules if security is important to you.

Probably the most common use of IP firewall is when you are using your linux machine as a router and firewall gateway to protect your local network from unauthorized access from outside your network.  

The following configuration is based on a contribution from Arnt Gulbrandsen, &lt;agulbra@troll.no&gt;.

The example describes the configuration of the firewall rules on the Linux firewall/router machine illustrated in this diagram:

&lt;pre&gt;

The following commands would normally be placed in an rc file so that they were automatically started each time the system boots. For maximum security they would be performed after the network interfaces are configured, but before the interfaces are actually brought up to prevent anyone gaining access while the firewall machine is rebooting.

Good firewall configurations are a little tricky. This example should be a reasonable starting point for you. The ipfwadm manual page offers some assistance in how to use the tool. If you intend to configure a firewall, be sure to ask around and get as much advice from sources you consider reliable and get someone to test/sanity check your configuration from the outside.

The new firewalling code is accessed via ``IP Firewall Chains''.  See the IP chanins home page for more information.  Among other things, you'll now need to use ipchains instead of ipfwadm to configure your filters. (From Documentation/Changes in the latest kernel sources).  
We are aware that this is a sorely out of date statement and we are currently working on getting this section more current. You can expect a newer version in August of 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== IPIP Encapsulation == 

Why would you want to encapsulate IP datagrams within IP datagrams? It must seem an odd thing to do if you've never seen an application of it before.  Ok, here are a couple of common places where it is used: Mobile-IP and IP-Multicast. What is perhaps the most widely spread use of it though is also the least well known, Amateur Radio.  

Kernel Compile Options:


             Networking options  ---&gt;
                 [*] TCP/IP networking
                 [*] IP: forwarding/gatewaying
                 ....
                 &lt;*&gt; IP: tunneling


IP tunnel devices are called `tunl0', `tunl1' etc.

&quot;But why ?&quot;. Ok, ok. Conventional IP routing rules mandate that an IP network comprises a network address and a network mask. This produces a series of contiguous addresses that may all be routed via a single routing entry.  This is very convenient, but it means that you may only use any particular IP address while you are connected to the particular piece of network to which it belongs. In most instances this is ok, but if you are a mobile netizen then you may not be able to stay connected to the one place all the time. IP/IP encapsulation (IP tunneling) allows you to overcome this restriction by allowing datagrams destined for your IP address to be wrapped up and redirected to another IP address. If you know that you're going to be operating from some other IP network for some time you can set up a machine on your home network to accept datagrams to your IP address and redirect them to the address that you will actually be using temporarily.

The diagram illustrates another possible reason to use IPIP encapsula­ tion, virtual private networking. This example presupposes that you have two machines each with a simple dial up internet connection. Each host is allocated just a single IP address. Behind each of these machines are some private local area networks configured with reserved IP network addresses. Suppose that you want to allow any host on net­ work A to connect to any host on network B, just as if they were prop­ erly connected to the Internet with a network route. IPIP encapsula­ tion will allow you to do this. Note, encapsulation does not solve the problem of how you get the hosts on networks A and B to talk to any other on the Internet, you still need tricks like IP Masquerade for that.  Encapsulation is normally performed by machine functioning as routers.

Linux router `A' would be configured with a script like the following:



        #!/bin/sh
        PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin
        mask=255.255.255.0
        remotegw=fff.ggg.hhh.iii
        #
        # Ethernet configuration
        ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 netmask $mask up
        route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask $mask eth0
        #
        # ppp0 configuration (start ppp link, set default route)
        pppd
        route add default ppp0
        #
        # Tunnel device configuration
        ifconfig tunl0 192.168.1.1 up
        route add -net 192.168.2.0 netmask $mask gw $remotegw tunl0



Linux router `B' would be configured with a similar script:



             #!/bin/sh
             PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin
             mask=255.255.255.0
             remotegw=aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd
             #
             # Ethernet configuration
             ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.1 netmask $mask up
             route add -net 192.168.2.0 netmask $mask eth0
             #
             # ppp0 configuration (start ppp link, set default route)
             pppd
             route add default ppp0
             #
             # Tunnel device configuration
             ifconfig tunl0 192.168.2.1 up
             route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask $mask gw $remotegw tunl0



The command:



             route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask $mask gw $remotegw tunl0



reads: `Send any datagrams destined for 192.168.1.0/24 inside an IPIP encap datagram with a destination address of aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd'.

Note that the configurations are reciprocated at either end. The tunnel device uses the `gw' in the route as the destination of the IP datagram in which it will place the datagram it has received to route.  That machine must know how to decapsulate IPIP datagrams, that is, it must also be configured with a tunnel device.

== A tunneled host configuration. ==

It doesn't have to be a whole network you route. You could for example route just a single IP address. In that instance you might configure the tunl device on the `remote' machine with its home IP address and at the A end just use a host route (and Proxy Arp) rather than a network route via the tunnel device. Let's redraw and modify our configuration appropriately. Now we have just host `B' which to want to act and behave as if it is both fully connected to the Internet and also part of the remote network supported by host `A':


&lt;pre&gt;

      192.168.1/24

          -
          |      ppp0 =                ppp0 =
          |  aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd      fff.ggg.hhh.iii
          |
          |   /-----\                 /-----\
          |   |     |       //        |     |
          |---|  A  |------//---------|  B  |
          |   |     |     //          |     |
          |   \-----/                 \-----/
          |                      also: 192.168.1.12
          -

&lt;/pre&gt;


Linux router `A' would be configured with:



             #!/bin/sh
             PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin
             mask=255.255.255.0
             remotegw=fff.ggg.hhh.iii
             #
             # Ethernet configuration
             ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 netmask $mask up
             route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask $mask eth0
             #
             # ppp0 configuration (start ppp link, set default route)
             pppd
             route add default ppp0
             #
             # Tunnel device configuration
             ifconfig tunl0 192.168.1.1 up
             route add -host 192.168.1.12 gw $remotegw tunl0
             #
             # Proxy ARP for the remote host
             arp -s 192.168.1.12 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx pub



Linux host `B' would be configured with:



        #!/bin/sh
        PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin
        mask=255.255.255.0
        remotegw=aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd
        #
        # ppp0 configuration (start ppp link, set default route)
        pppd
        route add default ppp0
        #
        # Tunnel device configuration
        ifconfig tunl0 192.168.1.12 up
        route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask $mask gw $remotegwtunl0



This sort of configuration is more typical of a Mobile-IP application.  Where a single host wants to roam around the Internet and maintain a single usable IP address the whole time. You should refer to the Mobile-IP section for more information on how that is handled in practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== IP Masquerade == 

Many people have a simple dialup account to connect to the Internet.  Nearly everybody using this sort of configuration is allocated a single IP address by the Internet Service Provider. This is normally enough to allow only one host full access to the network. IP Masquerade is a clever trick that enables you to have many machines make use of that one IP address, by causing the other hosts to look like, hence the term masquerade, the machine supporting the dialup connection. There is a small caveat and that is that the masquerade function nearly always works only in one direction, that is the masqueraded hosts can make calls out, but they cannot accept or receive network connections from remote hosts. This means that some network services do not work such as talk and others such as ftp must be configured to operate in passive (PASV) mode to operate.  Fortunately the most common network services such as telnet, World Wide Web and irc do work just fine.

Kernel Compile Options:


             Code maturity level options  ---&gt;
                 [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
             Networking options  ---&gt;
                 [*] Network firewalls
                 ....
                 [*] TCP/IP networking
                 [*] IP: forwarding/gatewaying
                 ....
                 [*] IP: masquerading (EXPERIMENTAL)



Normally you have your linux machine supporting a slip or PPP dialup line just as it would if it were a standalone machine. Additionally it would have another network device configured, perhaps an ethernet, configured with one of the reserved network addresses. The hosts to be masqueraded would be on this second network. Each of these hosts would have the IP address of the ethernet port of the linux machine set as their default gateway or router.

A typical configuration might look something like this:


&lt;pre&gt;

	     -                                   -
	      \                                  | 192.168.1.0
	       \                                 |   /255.255.255.0
		\                 ---------      |
		 |                | Linux | .1.1 |
	     NET =================| masq  |------|
		 |    PPP/slip    | router|      |  --------
		/                 ---------      |--| host |
	       /                                 |  |      |
	      /                                  |  --------
	     -                                   -


&lt;/pre&gt;

Masquerading with IPFWADM

The most relevant commands for this configuration are:

             # Network route for ethernet
             route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0
             #
             # Default route to the rest of the internet.
             route add default ppp0
             #
             # Cause all hosts on the 192.168.1/24 network to be masqueraded.
             ipfwadm -F -a m -S 192.168.1.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0



Masquerading with IPCHAINS

This is similar to using IPFWADM but the command structure has changed:

             # Network route for ethernet
             route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0
             #
             # Default route to the rest of the internet.
             route add default ppp0
             #

You can get more information on the Linux IP Masquerade feature from the IP Masquerade Resource Page. Also, a very detailed document about masquesrading is the ``IP-Masquerade mini-HOWTO'' (which also intructs to configure other OS's to run with a Linux masquerade server).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== IP Transparent Proxy ==

IP transparent proxy is a feature that enables you to redirect servers or services destined for another machine to those services on this machine.  Typically this would be useful where you have a linux machine as a router and also provides a proxy server. You would redirect all connections destined for that service remotely to the local proxy server.

Kernel Compile Options:


             Code maturity level options  ---&gt;
                     [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
             Networking options  ---&gt;
                     [*] Network firewalls
                     ....
                     [*] TCP/IP networking
                     ....
                     [*] IP: firewalling
                     ....
                     [*] IP: transparent proxy support (EXPERIMENTAL)



Configuration of the transparent proxy feature is performed using the ipfwadm command

An example that might be useful is as follows:

             root# ipfwadm -I -a accept -D 0/0 telnet -r 2323

This example will cause any connection attempts to port telnet (23) on any host to be redirected to port 2323 on this host. If you run a service on that port, you could forward telnet connections, log them or do whatever fits your need.

A more interesting example is redirecting all http traffic through a local cache. However, the protocol used by proxy servers is different from native http: where a client connects to www.server.com:80 and asks for /path/page, when it connects to the local cache it contacts proxy.local.domain:8080 and asks for www.server.com/path/page.

To filter an http request through the local proxy, you need to adapt the protocol by inserting a small server, called transproxy (you can find it on the world wide web). You can choose to run transproxy on port 8081, and issue this command:

             root# ipfwadm -I -a accept -D 0/0 80 -r 8081

The transproxy program, then, will receive all connections meant to reach external servers and will pass them to the local proxy after fixing protocol differences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mobile IP ==

The term &quot;IP mobility&quot; describes the ability of a host that is able to move its network connection from one point on the Internet to another without changing its IP address or losing connectivity. Usually when an IP host changes its point of connectivity it must also change its IP address.  IP Mobility overcomes this problem by allocating a fixed IP address to the mobile host and using IP encapsulation (tunneling) with automatic routing to ensure that datagrams destined for it are
routed to the actual IP address it is currently using.

A project is underway to provide a complete set of IP mobility tools for Linux.  The Status of the project and tools may be obtained from the: Linux Mobile IP Home Page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Multicast ==

IP Multicast allows an arbitrary number of IP hosts on disparate IP networks to have IP datagrams simultaneously routed to them. This mechanism is exploited to provide Internet wide &quot;broadcast&quot; material such as audio and video transmissions and other novel applications.  

Kernel Compile Options:


     Networking options  ---&gt;
             [*] TCP/IP networking
             ....
             [*] IP: multicasting


A suite of tools and some minor network configuration is required.  Please check the Multicast-HOWTO for more information on Multicast support in Linux.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== NAT - Network Address Translation == 

The IP Network Address Translation facility is pretty much the standardized big brother of the Linux IP Masquerade facility. It is specified in some detail in RFC-1631 at your nearest RFC archive. NAT provides features that IP-Masquerade does not that make it eminently more suitable for use in corporate firewall router designs and larger scale installations.

An alpha implementation of NAT for Linux 2.0.29 kernel has been developed by Michael.Hasenstein, Michael.Hasenstein@informatik.tu- chemnitz.de. Michaels documentation and implementation are available from:

Linux IP Network Address Web Page

Newer Linux 2.2.x kernels also include some NAT functionality in the routing algorithm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Traffic Shaper - Changing allowed bandwidth ==

The traffic shaper is a driver that creates new interface devices, those devices are traffic-limited in a user-defined way, they rely on physical network devices for actual transmission and can be used as outgoing routed for network traffic.

The shaper was introduced in Linux-2.1.15 and was backported to Linux-2.0.36 (it appeared in 2.0.36-pre-patch-2 distributed by Alan Cox, the author of the shaper device and maintainer of Linux-2.0).

The traffic shaper can only be compiled as a module and is configured by the shapecfg program with commands like the following:

             shapecfg attach shaper0 eth1
             shapecfg speed shaper0 64000

The shaper device can only control the bandwidth of outgoing traffic, as packets are transmitted via the shaper only according to the routing tables; therefore, a ``route by source address'' functionality could help in limiting the overall bandwidth of specific hosts using a Linux router.

Linux-2.2 already has support for such routing, if you need it for Linux-2.0 please check the patch by Mike McLagan, at ftp.invlogic.com.  Refer to Documentationnetworking/shaper.txt for further information about the shaper. 
 
If you want to try out a (tentative) shaping for incoming packets, try out rshaper-1.01 (or newer), from ftp.systemy.it.

The latest versions of Linux, 2.2 offer a lot of flexibility in routing policy. Unfortunately, you have to wait for the next version of this howto, or go read the kernel sources.

==Use, Limitations, and Options==

===Use===
----
This template makes a preformatted text box with adjusable styles.   It wraps long lines while preserving the preformatting of other lines.

The wrapping of long code lines, while preserving other preformats might be useful for Wiki and other code listings.   '''Poetry and lyrics''' might also make use of it, since they consist largely of preformatted text.   In any case, preformatted text can be CSS-styled to a considerable extent and need not be restricted to the style-sheet's default styles.    Refer to the options for their use.  The format to call the template into use is just:      
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{prewrap|width=200px|border=1px solid lightgrey|cbgc=lightyellow|1=Text with its formats here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Two typical examples look like this:
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
{{prewrap|width=200px|cbgc=lightyellow|The time has come for all good men to come to the aid of the party.   The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog 0123456789 times.
1   2   3   4   5
6    7    8    9    0}}{{prewrap|width=400px|align=left|cbgc=lightyellow|1=&lt;table class=toccolours style=&quot;margin: 1em 0 0 0; width: {{{width|300px}}}; background: {{{background|#f9f9f9;}}};&quot; align= {{{align|left}}}&gt;
&lt;td align=center style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;{{{Heading|{{{1}}}}}}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=left style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;{{{Content|{{{2}}}}}}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;}}
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
Notice that the very long ''unformatted'' text section and the long table list lines have been wrapped in their specified widths while the other lines which are formatted, have their white-space preserved.   This behaviour will be seen only for browsers which support the pre-wrap value of the white-space property.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
===Limitations===
----
This pre-wrap value is planned for Firefox 3.   Versions of Opera after Opera 8 already work well with it.   IE6 does not handle it but IE7 is unclear.

This template suffers in the usual way from parameters containing pipe symbols, and the conventional fixes still need applied.   For example, to display the code for a Wiki table, be sure to separate the template's closing curly brackets from the closing curly bracket of the table listing with a space.   In addition, use the ''numbered parameter'' when calling the template into use. HTML symbols are tolerated better.(See the above example).

Be sure to use the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' code to force the next box or text line into a clear space.   Follow-on material will otherwise float-left and wrap.  

===Options===
----

====Container====
----
;align:   container page position. left, center, or right, default left
;border:   box outer all round border, default 1px solid lightgray
;height:   box height, default auto
;width:   box width, default auto
;overflow:   action in event of text overflow; eg scrollbars , default auto
 

====Content==== 
----
;cbgc:  content box background color, default transparent 
;cfc:   content text color, default inherit
;clh:   content height between text lines, default 1.1em
;cp:    content text padding, default 1em 
;cff:   content font family, default inherit
;cfs:   content font size, default inherit
;cfst:  content font style, default normal
;ctha:  content text horizontal alignment, default left. Options; left,center,right 
;cfw:   content font weight, default normal 

====The White-space Property==== 
----
;wrap:   white-space handling, default pre-wrap. Options are normal, pre, pre-wrap, or nowrap.

====Notes on White-space====
----
The ''normal'' option resembles the usual Wiki behaviour for white-space, in that it does not generally preserve white-space, except for excess line spacing.   The ''pre'' option preserves ''all'' white-space.   The ''pre-wrap'' option wraps long lines while preserving all other white-space; this is the choice for Wiki code listings.   The ''nowrap'' option does not preserve any white-space, not even double line spacing, and places everything into one line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To work with money it is very important to have a good grasp of how to use math. To make a simple transaction you need to be able to add and subtract. But if you have a bank account or work with investments, it becomes more and more important to understand multiplication and division. In fact, to make any money at all you have to be able to do math!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create an XForms front end to an XQuery script that will move a resource from one collection to another collection or you want to move a collection from one location to another location.

== Method ==
We will build a simple XForms front end to the xmldb:move() operator.  The syntax of the move operators is the following:

xmldb:move($from-collection, $to-collection, $resource)

Where:

   $from-collection is the path name to the collection you are moving the file from
   $to-collection is the path name to the collection you are moving the file to
   $resource in the name of the resource

If you are going to move a complete collection the format is:

xmldb:move($old-collection, $new-collection)

On this case the operation:

   xmldb:move('/db/bar', '/db/foo')

would result in the bar collection being located inside the foo collection:

   /db/foo/bar

To test this application create two test collections in your eXist database such as:

   /db/from-collection
   /db/to-collection

== Sample XForms Client ==

Create the following xhtml file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot; 
xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Move File&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;style language=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
       &lt;![CDATA[
       @namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
         .from .xf-value  {width: 40ex;}
         .to .xf-value  {width: 40ex;}
       ]]&gt;
       &lt;/style&gt;
       &lt;xf:model&gt;
           &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;     
               &lt;data&gt;
                   &lt;from&gt;/db/from-collection&lt;/from&gt;
                   &lt;to&gt;/db/to-collection&lt;/to&gt;
                   &lt;resource&gt;foo.xml&lt;/resource&gt;
               &lt;/data&gt;
           &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
            &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;save&quot; method=&quot;get&quot; 
               action=&quot;move.xq&quot;
               separator=&quot;&amp;amp;&quot;
               replace=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/xf:model&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Move Resource&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;from&quot; class=&quot;from&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;From Collection:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:input&gt;
        &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;to&quot; class=&quot;to&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;To Collection:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:input&gt;
       &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;resource&quot; class=&quot;resource&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Resource:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:input&gt;
        &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;save&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Move File&lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:submit&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample XQuery on Server ==
The following XQuery named &quot;move.xq&quot; should be placed in the same collection as the move.xhtml file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace xmldb=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/xmldb&quot;;

(: this logs you in and makes sure you have write access to the desitination folder :)
let $login := xmldb:collection('/db/to-collection', 'username', 'password')

let $from := request:get-parameter('from', '')
let $to := request:get-parameter('to', '')
let $resource := request:get-parameter('resource', '')

let $code := xmldb:move($from, $to, $resource)

return
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Move Result&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;from:&lt;/b&gt;{$from}&lt;br/&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;to:&lt;/b&gt;{$to}&lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;b&gt;resource:&lt;/b&gt;{$resource}&lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;b&gt;result code:&lt;/b&gt;Result code is
     &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Move a Collection ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html omit-xml-declaration=yes indent=yes&quot;;

(: this logs you in and makes sure you have write access to the destination folder :)
let $login := xmldb:login('/db', 'user-id', 'your-password')
 
let $from := request:get-parameter('from', '')
let $to := request:get-parameter('to', '')

(: You can put in checks to make sure that both from and to are not null here and that they both exist. :)
 
let $move-result-code := xmldb:move($from, $to)
 
return
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Move Collection Result&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Move Collection Result&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;from:&lt;/b&gt;{$from}&lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;to:&lt;/b&gt;{$to}&lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;b&gt;result code:&lt;/b&gt;Result code is:{$move-result-code}
     &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
Now that you have the core move code done, you can enhance the program to browse to a specific collection for the source and browse to a specific collection for the destination.  You can also create a listing of the resources in the source and destination folders.

== What is Sahana? ==
{{wikipedia|Sahana FOSS Disaster Management System}}
=== Overview ===
[http://sahanafoundation.org/ Sahana] is a web based collaboration tool that addresses the common coordination problems during a disaster. The New York City Office of Emergency Management has worked with contractors, the original creators of Sahana, and the international open source Sahana community to modify the application to fill operational gaps in the New York City Coastal Storm Plan. 
==== Technology and infrastructure ====
*WAMP/LAMP technology stack (Windows or Linux Operating System)
**Apache Web Server
**MySQL database
**PHP/Perl programming language 

== How is Sahana Organized? ==
=== Modules ===
Sahana is organized according to functional modules.  The following are module descriptions describe the main functions of New York City Sahana

==== Site System - Manage emergency sheltering facility profiles ====
The Site System module tracks basic information about each of our CSP sheltering facilities. 
Data points: Facility name, address, operational use, staffing pattern, opening sequence  

==== Staff Registration System - Store contact information for NYC employees designated for CSP operations ====
The Staff Registration System (SRS) organizes contact information for the city employees who have been assigned to the CSP.  SRS database size is limited only by hardware (currently configured for ~68,000 staff)
Data points: Unique Identifier, first name, last name, Emergency role classification, agency, PMS ID, civil service title, home address, work address, three phone numbers, two email addresses, language information,  and drivers license classification

==== Shelteree Tracking System - Monitor shelterees staying in city run shelters ====
The Shelteree Tracking System captures information on people seeking shelter in the NYC sheltering system.  Shelterees are organized by family representative and include pets in the family unit.
Data points: Name, age, address, pet information, family composition, facility within which the family is taking shelter

==== Staff Activation, Notification, and Deplyoment System (SANDS) - Activate and assign ~36,000 CSP staff to over 600 discrete operations ====
The Staff Activation, Notification, and Deployment System (SANDS) merges data from the Site System and the Staff Registration System to assign 36,000 staff to over 600 discrete operations based on the geographic location of the staff and the needed staff classifications of the activated operations.  After facility activation, staff assignment, and message creation take place, that information is pushed to a third party mass-messaging provider who has the ability to send text and audio messages to ~60,000 people in under 40 minutes.

==== Reporting - Provide situational awareness for decision makers and logistics coordinators ====
The reporting module integrates table-based data aggregation and googlemaps mashups to provide real time situational updates on staffing levels, shelteree levels, shelteree population characteristics, shelteree family timelines, and a search function for staff and shelterees.

==== Administration - Manage accounts, passwords, and application configurations ====

== Who uses Sahana? ==
Administrators at the Office of Emergency Management, Department of Homeless Services, and city employees in the field are all users of Sahana.

=== How does an Evacuation Center use Sahana? ===
Evacuation Center Sahana staff are responsible for electronically checking in all staff assigned to the Evacuation Center and it's attached Hurricane Shelters.  For step by step instructions, please go to &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;(include link)&lt;/font&gt;

=== How does a Hurricane Shelter or Special Medical Needs Shelter use Sahana? ===
Hurricane Shelters and Special Medical Needs Shelters Sahana staff are responsible for electronically entering shelteree data.  Currently, Sahana staff at Hurricane Shelters and Special Medical Needs Shelters do not check in their own staff.

Who started this book as a guide to Sim City? [[User:Davumaya|Davumaya]] ([[User talk:Davumaya|talk]]) 21:04, 15 July 2008 (UTC) Never mind I found out how this came to be via deletion discussion. Interesting. But urban planning is a profession and skill set that is related to but has little to do as Sim City simulates. I will be taking this book into the proper direction. [[User:Davumaya|Davumaya]] ([[User talk:Davumaya|talk]]) 21:12, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

:I believe the intention of the past discussion that lead to its current shape was for Sim City to be used as a learning tool to help aid in explaining and teaching urban planning. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:28, 17 July 2008 (UTC)

== Merge/rename ==

'''Urban planning''' does not fully encompass what this book should entail. A proper guide to the profession would need to include the terms ''land use'' and ''development''. As well the focus would need to be properly addressed, are we speaking of all types of planning from city to regional? I will in the coming days figure out some alternative names and propose them here. [[User:Davumaya|Davumaya]] ([[User talk:Davumaya|talk]]) 21:37, 15 July 2008 (UTC)


Sim City's creator is Will Wright not Sid Meier (Civilization) - I can't edit the page, someone pls make the correction</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Health effects of Benzene ==

Unless someone can point out a reason why so much should be devoted to the health effects of Benzene, it seems improper to have it here. Wikipedia covers the health effects of benezene in greater depth and I think if that's someone's interest, they'll go check Wikipedia first. A short note that Benzene is hazaradous and a carcinogen is probably sufficient. Anyway, if nobody objects over the next few weeks or so, I'm gonna yank that. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 03:31, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

==Images==
Anyone have any ideas as to how best to create free images of electron density around a conjugated molecule? This chapter needs those badly. [[User:Bmjm|Bmjm]] ([[User talk:Bmjm|talk]]) 21:35, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

:What molecules would you want to see? There are one or two on Commons:

      <text xml:space="preserve">I thought I would share this with everybody given the effort that went into getting this to work.

What I wanted to do was raise alerts for a specific Storage Group / Mailstore going down using caiLogA2, and reset the trigger when that specific Storage Group / Mailstore came back up.

: Event Type:	Information
: Event Source:	MSExchangeIS Mailbox Store
: Event Category:	General 
: Event ID:	'''9523'''
: Date:		16/07/2008
: Time:		1:42:35 p.m.
: User:		N/A
: Computer:	NZWNLSSTEMP01
: Description: The Microsoft Exchange Database '''&quot;test SG-1\Mailstore-1b&quot;''' has been started. 


The specific identifiers in this case are the '''Event IDs''' and the Store name'''test SG-1\Mailstore-1b'''


After much trial and error I have determined that the &quot;\&quot; is a special character that cannot be tolerated. Also the filters are sensitive to case and leading and trailing blanks.
 
So…

We use the following filter settings with .* being the wildcard marker replacing what we can do without. NOTE that it a dot and a star  '''.*'''



Using Positive Pattern &amp; Positive Toggle Pattern.


* ''Rule name''
* SYSTEM_LOG\application
* Computer: .* Source: MSExchangeIS Mailbox Store Type: .* Event-ID: 9539 User: .* Category: .* Description: .*test SG-1.*Mailstore-1b.*
* Computer: .* Source: MSExchangeIS Mailbox Store Type: .* Event-ID: 9523 User: .* Category: .* Description: .*test SG-1.*Mailstore-1b.*
* ''Per Poll''
* ''Toggled''
* ''Generate''
* ''Send''

 


Now all I need to do is reproduce this for all the different Mailstores being very careful to match the spelling and character cases, and watch for leading and trailing blanks.

Only problem at the moment is that I cannot find where the filters are stored and cannot edit existing filters.  Each change requires building a whole new filter.





'''''Job definitions'''''

* ''-.*First Storage Group.*Mailbox Store-0.*''
* SYSTEM_LOG\application
* Computer: .* Source: MSExchangeIS Mailbox Store Type: .* Event-ID: 9539 User: .* Category: .* Description: .*First Storage Group.*Mailbox Store-0.*

* ''Send''

= file formats =

Kicad creates and uses files of several different formats.

* Files that end in &quot;.sch&quot; are schematics.
* Files that end in &quot;.lib&quot; are schematic part library files.
* Files that end in &quot;.cache.lib&quot; are schematic part library files, too. But the parts are only a cache for parts used in the current project the file is named for.
* Files that end in &quot;.pro&quot; are project files
* Files that end in &quot;.dcm&quot; add documentation to parts in the library file with the same name. The &quot;.dcm&quot; file contains the description, keywords and docfilename whereas the &quot;.lib&quot; file contains information about how the part is drawn, the pins etcetera.

* Files that end in &quot;.bak&quot; ... are old backup files ... (Don't archive).
* Files that end in &quot;.bck&quot; ... are old backup files ... (Don't archive).

* Files that end in &quot;.brd&quot; are PCB layout files.


* Files that end in &quot;.000&quot; ...
* Files that end in &quot;.cmp&quot; ... are footprint information files that are modified by the PCBNew program
* Files that end in &quot;.erc&quot; are output from the schematic electronic rules check (ERC).
* Files that end in &quot;.gcd&quot; ...
* Files that end in &quot;.lst&quot; are netlist output from the schematic. (Don't archive).
* Files that end in &quot;.net&quot; are netlist output from the schematic. (Don't archive).

* Files that end in &quot;.mod&quot; are module libraries (a KiCad &quot;module&quot; is called a &quot;footprint&quot; or a &quot;decal&quot; in other CAD software)
* Files that end in &quot;.mdc&quot; ...

* Files that end in &quot;.dsn&quot; are regenerated from the &quot;.kicad_pcb&quot; file every time you hit the &quot;autoroute&quot; button and then hit the &quot;Export a Specctra Design (*.dsn) file&quot;. (Don't archive).

* Files that end in &quot;.ses&quot; are session files output from the autorouter. (Don't archive).

*vtext_justify = Vertical text justify (T=Top, B=Bottom, C=Centre(default))

=== Description of $FPLIST ===

This line exists if one or more footprints are specified. Footprint names can have wildcards.

=== Description of ALIAS ===

This line exists only if the component has alias names.

'''Format:'''

'''ALIAS''' ''name1 name2 name3…''

=== Description of DRAW ===

Lists graphic elements and pins. Each line defines a single element. The line starts with a single character indicating the type e.g. P indicates a polygon. The following items are commonly used in some of the elements:

*posx, posy = Position of the graphic element
*unit = unit no. in case of multiple units
*convert = In case of variations in shape for units, each variation has a number. 0 indicates no variations. For example, an inverter may have two variations - one with the bubble on the input and one on the output.
*thickness = line thickness
*fill = fill colour (F=filled with foreground colour, f=filled with background colour, N=Not filled(default))

==== A record (Arc) ====

'''A''' ''posx posy radius start_angle end_angle unit convert thickness fill startx starty endx endy''

*posx, posy = centre of the circle part of which is the arc
*radius = radius of the lost arc
*start_angle = start angle of the arc in tenths of degrees
*end_angle = end angle of the arc in tenths of degrees
*startx, starty = coordiantes of the start of the arc
*endx, endy = coordinates of the end of the arc

==== C record (Circle) ====

'''C''' ''posx posy radius unit convert thickness fill''

*posx, posy = centre of the circle
*radius = radius of the circle

==== P record (Polyline) ====

The polyline has a series of points. It need not described a closed shape i.e. a polygon. To do this make the first pair the same as the last pair.

'''P''' ''point_count unit convert thickness (posx posy)* fill''

*point_count = no. of coordinate pairs. posx and posy are repaeated these many times.

==== S record (Rectangle) ====

'''S''' ''startx starty endx endy unit convert thickness fill''

*startx, starty = Starting corner of the rectangle
*endx, endy = End corner of the rectangle

==== T record (Text) ====

'''T''' ''direction posx posy text_size text_type unit convert text''

*direction = Direction of text(0=Horizintal, 900=Vertical(default))
*text_size = Size of the text
*text_type = ???
*text = Text to be displayed. All ~ characters are replaced with spaces.

==== X record (Pin) ====

'''X''' ''name num posx posy length direction name_text_size num_text_size unit convert electrical_type pin_type''

*name = name displayed on the pin
*num = pin no. displayed on the pin
*posx = Position X same units as the length
*posy = Position Y same units as the length
*length = length of pin
*direction = R for Right, L for left, U for Up, D for Down
*name_text_size = Text size for the pin name
*num_text_size = Text size for the pin number
*electrical_type = Elec. Type of pin (I=Input, O=Output, B=Bidi, T=tristate,P=Passive, U=Unspecified, W=Power In, w=Power Out, C=Open Collector, E=Open Emitter, N=Not Connected)
*pin_type = Type of pin or &quot;Graphic Style&quot; (N=Not Visible, I=Invert (hollow circle), C=Clock, IC=Inverted Clock, L=Low In (IEEE), CL=Clock Low, V=Low Out (IEEE), F=Falling Edge, NX=Non Logic). Optional (when not specified uses &quot;Line&quot; graphic style).

=== Field Description ===

=== Drawings ===

All physical units are in mils (1/1000th inch) unless otherwise noted.  The default layer number for graphic segments is 21, which corresponds to SilkS_Front.

'''DS''' ''x1 y1 x2 y2 width layer''
:Draws a line segment from (''x1'', ''y1'') to (''x2'', ''y2'') with width ''width'' on the ''layer'' number specified.

'''DC''' ''x1 y1 x2 y2 width layer''
:Draws a circle whose center is (''x1'', ''y1''), and whose radius is specified by the segment (''x1'', ''y1'') - (''x2'', ''y2'') with line width ''width'' on the ''layer'' number specified.

'''DA''' ''x1 y1 x2 y2 angle width layer''
:Draws a circular arc.  Center is at (''x1'', ''y1'').  The arc's starting point is (''x2'', ''y2'').  The length of the arc sweeps clockwise (for positive angles) from here by the number of degrees specified by (''angle'' / 10).

=== Pad Descriptions ===

=== $SHAPE3D ===

=== $PAD ===

A pad is usually a copper area for electrical connection to an electrical component. It has an optional hole for through-hole components, or may be defined as an area on a single copper layer for surface-mount components. It can also be used as a thermal connection for heat distribution, or as a hole for mounting or other uses.

'''Sh''' &quot;''padNum''&quot; ''shape'' ''xSize'' ''ySize'' ''yBaseIncrease'' ''xBaseIncrease'' ''angle''
:Defines the pad's dominant shape. ''padNum'' defines the pad number. The shape of the pad (''shape'') can be circular ('''C'''), ovate ('''O'''), rectangular ('''R'''), or trapezoidal ('''T''') with its size specified by ''xSize'' and ''ySize''. (Note that for circular pad shapes ''xSize'' and ''ySize'' must be equal.) The pad is rotated at an angle of ''angle''. For trapezoidal shapes, ''yBaseIncrease'' specifies how much taller the pad's left edge is from its right, and ''xBaseIncrease'' specifies how much wider the pad's bottom is from its top; ''xSize'' and ''ySize'' then specify the size of the pad at its center and the trapezoidal effect increases one edge and decreases the other.

'''Dr''' ''dia'' ''xOffset'' ''yOffset''
:Defines the pad's drilled hole offset from the pad's position by (''xOffset'',''yOffset'') with a diameter of ''dia''. To specify no hole, specify ''dia'' as '''0'''. Note that the drilled hole can be located offset from the center of the pad's shape ('''Sh''') although [[pcbnew]] requires the drilled hole be located on the pad itself.

'''At''' ''type'' ''flag'' ''layers''
:Defines the pad's attributes. The pad type is specified by ''type'' and can be '''STD''' for a standard pad with a hole, '''SMD''' for a surface-mount pad, '''CONN''' for a connector, or '''HOLE''' for a hole. ''flag'' is '''N''' (unknown function). ''layers'' specifies the active layers as a 32-bit hexadecimal number with leading zeroes such that active layers are indicated by a 1 bit and inactive by 0.

'''Ne''' ''unknown'' &quot;''netName''&quot;
:Defines the net name as ''netName''. There are other options specified by the ''unknown'' flag: it appears that ''unknown'' is 0 in a module library and has a numeric value other than 0 when placed and connected in a board file.

'''Po''' ''x'' ''y''
:Defines the position of the pad as (''x'',''y''). This is the point that traces must terminate for [[pcbnew]] to confirm connection to a pad.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pedigree charts, Descendant charts, Register reports, Ahnentafel reports, Timeline reports – they all look at the same data from different view points.   Often the very act of looking at the same data that has been worked on for years from a different angle will highlight a link or a correlation that hasn't been noticed before.  This in turn may prompt the instigation of new lines of research, extending Family Trees into new directions.

Until recently, geographical mapping of Family Trees was the domain of a handful of enthusiastic Genealogists who had a great deal of time on their hands or who had access to expensive GIS systems to produce maps for web pages.  However since the introduction of a number of free
mapping sites from Google, Microsoft and Yahoo this technology has now been made accessible to anyone with an Internet connection.
 
These new technologies provide the researcher with the opportunity to do more than just share static charts or maps with relations or fellow researchers.  Now genealogists can share clickable, zoomable maps showing locations of people and events from their family’s history.  It is 
possible to overlay data with another researcher’s data to look for possible correlations.  It is even possible overlay digitised copies of old maps and see how the landscape has changed over the years.  

The emerging standard way of storing this kind of data is to use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language KML] files which are readily viewed by tools such as [http://maps.google.com Google Maps] or [http://earth.google.com Google Earth].  These require no special Genealogy software to view and so offer an alternative
method of sharing a family tree with friends or relations.

Tools such as [http://www.familytreeassistant.com Map My Ancestors] or [http://www.progenysoftware.com Map My Family Tree] offer the ability to
take existing Family Tree files and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocode geocode] the places for viewing in [http://earth.google.com Google Earth].

Spam. No not the canned food SPAM, but it sure is unhealthy like the canned food when we get tons of spam emails. 


Why is spam such a nuisance? To understand the nuisance, one need to understand the numbers behind spam emails. The following tables are extracted from spam-filter-review.toptenreviews.com which shows the magnitude of spam emails we are dealing with. These statistics were derived from a number of different reputable sources including: Google, Brightmail, Jupiter Research, eMarketer, Gartner, MailShell, Harris Interactive, and Ferris Research.&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

Spam messages are the equivalent of the junk mail you receive in your postal mailbox, and it's a huge problem. &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Not even the government can stop the flow of spam emails - all thanks to the Bill of Rights. &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Often spammers are out to sell you any products or services, but rather to identify active email addresses that are valid.&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; These valid email addresses can be sold to marketers just like how our mailing addresses or phone numbers are sold. Spam have become such an issue that in 2004 Bill Gates (probably the number one receivers of spam emails in the world) publicized of creating a program that filters our spam messages and that by 2006 we will live spam free. However, it's already 2008 and spam emails still exist and is still a major issue which schools and corporations needs to worry about. http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/vulnerabilities/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=177103434


Unfortunately, once you're on a spam list it's practically impossible to escape. However avoiding these traps may help you avoid getting more spam in the future.
So what can we do to reduce spam emails? There are several techniques that one can do to reduce the amount of spams one can receive which is highlighted by the next section.



==== Ways to reduce the amount of spam emails we receive ====


1) Limit the public use of your email addresses. The more you exposed your email address to the public the more spam emails you will receive.

2) Never reply or open any spam emails. Any spam emails that are opened or replied to informs the spammers of your existence and that your email is valid.

3) Disguising your email address on public website or groups by spelling out the at sign &quot;@&quot; and DOT &quot;.&quot;. This usually programs that spammers uses to catch valid email addresses.

4) Use alternate email addresses to register for any personal or shopping website. Never use your home or business addresses for these sites but rather use email addresses that are free from Yahoo, Hotmail, or GMAIL.

5) Do not forward any emails from unknown recipients.

6) Use the preview options in your email program, before opening the email.

7) Never use your email address as your screen name in chat groups or rooms.

8) Never E-mail a spammer asking them to remove their address from the mailing list (sad, but true - more often than not this just confirms that your e-mail address is active!)

9) If all else fails, you just disconnect yourself from the Internet world. ;)


==== Anti Spam Softwares ====

Turning on Spam Filter options that are available in most email programs and Internet service provider. As most filters are, it is not 100% proof to block all spams. Thus, initially the spam filter might need training to avoid accidentally tag emails that are legit as spam and vice versa.



McAfee SiteAdvisor is a free plugin that can be installed on Internet Explorer and Firefox for most operating systems.
The plugin displays a color rating based on reviews for each site visited with the following color rating:
Green - Safe: We tested the site and didn't find any significant problems. (&quot;We've tested this site and found it safe to use,&quot; for secure sites.)
Yellow - Caution: Our tests revealed some issues you should know about. (Example: a site tried to change our browser defaults, or sent a lot of non-spam e-mail)
Red - Warning: Our tests revealed some serious issues that you'll want to carefully consider before using this site at all. (Example: The site sent us lots of spam e-mail or bundled adware with a download).
Grey - The site has not been tested, or is in the process of being tested.
Grey box with M - SiteAdvisor's Review Site for a website (to reduce phony reviews).

== Phishing ==


Phishing. Also known as carding or spoofing. Phishing is homonym for fishing which also probably came from the word fishing. 

Unlike fishing where you would take out your tackle box and hook a bait for the fish to bite on , phishing rather sets up a bogus website to maliciously collect sensitive information about you. Phishing comes usually comes in form of an email where it has several link that routes to an almost legit banking of your choice and but when clicking on the link does not route you to the bank, rather to a fake site where it's main purpose is to collect sensitive information from the email recipient. Phishing usually mimic to be one of the reliable and reputable company, government, or website such as PayPal, Amazon.com, EBay, Citibank, Bank of America, Apple, and even Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 

[[Image:PhishingTrustedBank.png|thumb|right|Example of Phishing Email]]


People who usually falls for this trap or got phished usually have to deal with identity theft and loosing several hundred or thousands of dollars. Not only do the victim looses money and their identity theft, but also their valuable time to clean up their identity and possibly their credit history. Usually Phishers opens a new line of credit cards with their newly acquired sensitive information they phished from their phishing emails.



==== Ways to avoid being PHISHED ====

1. ALL legitimate businesses and government agencies NEVER request personal information over an unsecured Web site. So be suspicious of demanding or threatening e-mails requesting for any sensitive information.

2. Check your accounts regularly such as Bank, Credit Cards, Cellular accounts to make sure all transactions are legitimate.

3. Never call telephone numbers found on suspected Web site or email.

4. Be careful regarding with attachments send through email, as downloading any unknown attachments on your computer can put your personal information at risk and potentially harm your computer’s hard drive. Always make sure the attachments is virus free and comes from a legitimate Web site, not an e-mail message.

5. Always type in the URL of the Web page you need. Phishing schemes depend on embedded links that take you to fake sites.

6. Only provide personal information (like a credit card number and social security number), do so only via a secure website or the telephone. 

7. Keep your computer up-to-date with anti-virus and firewall programs and patches for your operating systems.

8. Keep updated with the latest security improvements of your software providers.

9. Use common sense, if it feels weird, or too good to be true, it probably is. Don’t be tempted by easy money or cowed by authoritative language.

10. Lastly again, don’t use the Internet at all. ;)

==== Anti-Phishing Programs ====


Windows Vista has this new feature called the Microsoft Phishing filter that works within Windows Mail and Internet Explorer 7. This new feature compares the link embedded in the email messages to an online list of known phishing websites. If the link matches one of the link to a fraudulent website, Windows mail displays a warning message at the top of the message or the Internet Explore browser. The page will also be displayed a neutral page and displaying a warning message.  This add-on feature or settings is also available on other browser in Firefox and Safari.

Whether you're using Windows Internet Explorer, Apple Mail, or any other email program always use your own intuition to determine if the link is legitimate or not. Never provide any sensitive information such as social security number or date of birth and password over email. Any sensitive information that is needed are usually gather in person, mail, phone, or directly on the company or organization website. Never through the email.

McAfee Site Advisor which was mentioned earlier can be used to thwart phishing emails. 

Gmail has the functionality to allow users to report any phishing emails to the Gmail team to review and possibly tag senders of the phishing email as phishers. Most email programs probably have tutorials on how to detect and thwart Phishing emails. Here is a short youtube tutorial video on how to detect phishing in GMAIL --&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWVoPu1lLM


==Hoaxes==

Hoaxes are usually prank emails that delivers false information to the recipient. Some of the hoax usually tells the recipient to either maliciously delete an essential file from their computer or perform certain action such as forwarding it to certain number of people within a timeframe. Also hoax emails misleads the recipients in believing something that contradicts reality. In 2001, an email was circulated around the Internet, depicting a shark jumping out of the water attacking military personnel climbing up the suspended ladder attached to helicopter. This image that circulated around the Internet also claimed to be National Geographic picture of the year. However, National Geographic who wants to maintain their reputation and work, publicized that the image and email is a hoax and that the image was enhanced by someone using 2 of the existing National Geographic images. Here is the article that was publish by National Geographic --&gt; http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0815_020815_photooftheyear.html


Other hoax emails are usually to mislead victims that there are huge amount of money that they can collect from a deceased prince or distance relatives. While other hoax email can be posed as legitimate doctors or lawyers who are looking to rent or buy certain items posted on some of the favorite want ads site such as craigslists.com or Ebay. Here is an example of a hoax email I received within 2 days of posting my rental place. Note that I xxxx  or$#%#% out certain part of the email to protect the legit business name where the hoaxer used.

If any email seems to be good to be true, do your checking before falling prey into such hoax emails. Luckily, I Google on supposedly this fake doctor that is using a free yahoo email address and found the following site that lead me to believe the above email is a hoax email. http://hubpages.com/hub/The-Apartment-Listing-Response-Scam


Here is another example of a hoax email notoriously known as the nigerian 419 scams where supposedly I can invest in a lucrative investments --&gt; http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/info/nigeria.htm

Hoax email has been such an issue that ABC news did a 20/20 on nigerian 419 scams. http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=2705112
 


==== Useful Anti Hoax sites ====

There are several sites on the Internet that can be used as reference to check if the email is a hoax or not. Some of my favorite sites are:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ISDN ==

The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a series of standards that specify a general purpose switched digital data network. An ISDN `call' creates a synchronous point to point data service to the destination. ISDN is generally delivered on a high speed link that is broken down into a number of discrete channels.  There are two different types of channels, the `B Channels' which will actually carry the user data and a single channel called the `D channel' which is used to send control information to the ISDN exchange to establish calls and other functions. In Australia for example, ISDN may be delivered on a 2Mbps link that is broken into 30 discrete 64kbps B channels with one 64kbps D channel. Any number of channels may be used at a time and in any combination. You could for example establish 30 separate calls to 30 different destinations at 64kbps each, or you could establish 15 calls to 15 different destinations at 128kbps each (two channels used per call), or just a small number of calls and leave the rest idle. A channel may be used for either incoming or outgoing calls. The original intention of ISDN was to allow Telecommunications companies to provide a single data service which could deliver either telephone (via digitised voice) or data services to your home or business without requiring you to make any special configuration changes.

There are a few different ways to connect your computer to an ISDN service.  One way is to use a device called a `Terminal Adaptor' which plugs into the Network Terminating Unit that you telecommunications carrier will have installed when you got your ISDN service and presents a number of serial interfaces. One of those interfaces is used to enter commands to establish calls and configuration and the others are actually connected to the network devices that will use the data circuits when they are established. Linux will work in this sort of configuration without modification, you just treat the port on the Terminal Adaptor like you would treat any other serial device.  Another way, which is the way the kernel ISDN support is designed for allows you to install an ISDN card into your Linux machine and then has your Linux software handle the protocols and make the calls itself. 
 
Kernel Compile Options:

             ISDN subsystem  ---&gt;
                     &lt;*&gt; ISDN support
                     [ ] Support synchronous PPP
                     [ ] Support audio via ISDN
                     &lt; &gt; ICN 2B and 4B support
                     &lt; &gt; PCBIT-D support
                     &lt; &gt; Teles/NICCY1016PC/Creatix support


The Linux implementation of ISDN supports a number of different types of internal ISDN cards. These are those listed in the kernel configuration options:


	·  ICN 2B and 4B
	·  Octal PCBIT-D
	·  Teles ISDN-cards and compatibles


Some of these cards require software to be downloaded to them to make them operational. There is a separate utility to do this with.


Full details on how to configure the Linux ISDN support is available from the /usr/src/linux/Documentation/isdn/ directory and an FAQ dedicated to isdn4linux is available at www.lrz-muenchen.de.  (You can click on the english flag to get an english version).

A note about PPP. The PPP suite of protocols will operate over either asynchronous or synchronous serial lines. The commonly distributed PPP daemon for Linux `pppd' supports only asynchronous mode. If you wish to run the PPP protocols over your ISDN service you need a specially modified version. Details of where to find it are available in the documentation referred to above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PLIP for Linux-2.0 == 

PLIP device names are `plip0', `plip1 and plip2.

Kernel Compile Options:


&lt;pre&gt;
             Network device support  ---&gt;
                 &lt;*&gt; PLIP (parallel port) support
&lt;/pre&gt;


plip (Parallel Line IP), is like SLIP, in that it is used for providing a point to point network connection between two machines, except that it is designed to use the parallel printer ports on your machine instead of the serial ports (a cabling diagram in included in the cabling diagram section later in this document). Because it is possible to transfer more than one bit at a time with a parallel port, it is possible to attain higher speeds with the plip interface than with a standard serial device.  In addition, even the simplest of parallel ports, printer ports, can be used in lieu of you having to purchase comparatively expensive 16550AFN UART's for your serial ports. PLIP uses a lot of CPU compared to a serial link and is most certainly not a good option if you can obtain some cheap ethernet cards, but it will work when nothing else is available and will work quite well.  You should expect a data transfer rate of about 20 kilobytes per second when a link is running well.

The PLIP device drivers competes with the parallel device driver for the parallel port hardware. If you wish to use both drivers then you should compile them both as modules to ensure that you are able to select which port you want to use for PLIP and which ports you want for the printer driver.  Refer to the ``Mudules mini-HOWTO'' for more information on kernel module configuration.

Please note that some laptops use chipsets that will not work with PLIP because they do not allow some combinations of signals that PLIP relies on, that printers don't use. 

The Linux plip interface is compatible with the Crynwyr Packet Driver PLIP and this will mean that you can connect your Linux machine to a DOS machine running any other sort of tcp/ip software via plip.

In the 2.0.* series kernel the plip devices are mapped to i/o port and IRQ as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
        device  i/o     IRQ
        ------  -----   ---
        plip0   0x3bc   5
        plip1   0x378   7
        plip2   0x278   2
&lt;/pre&gt;



If your parallel ports don't match any of the above combinations then you can change the IRQ of a port using the ifconfig command using the `irq' parameter (be sure to enable IRQ's on your printer ports in your ROM BIOS if it supports this option). As an alternative, you can specify ``io='' annd ``irq='' options on the insmod command line, if you use modules. For example:

             root# insmod plip.o io=0x288 irq=5

PLIP operation is controlled by two timeouts, whose default values are probably ok in most cases. You will probably need to increase them if you have an especially slow computer, in which case the timers to increase are actually on the other computer.  A program called plipconfig exists that allows you to change these timer settings without recompiling your kernel. It is supplied with many Linux distributions.

To configure a plip interface, you will need to invoke the following commands (or add them to your initialization scripts): 

             root# /sbin/ifconfig plip1 localplip pointopoint remoteplip
             root# /sbin/route add remoteplip plip1

Here, the port being used is the one at I/O address 0x378; localplip amd remoteplip are the names or IP addresses used over the PLIP cable.  I personally keep them in my /etc/hosts database: 

             # plip entries
             192.168.3.1   localplip
             192.168.3.2   remoteplip

The pointopoint parameter has the same meaning as for SLIP, in that it specifies the address of the machine at the other end of the link.  
In almost all respects you can treat a plip interface as though it were a SLIP interface, except that neither dip nor slattach need be, nor can be, used.

Further information on PLIP may be obtained from the ``PLIP mini- HOWTO''.

      <comment>Fixed a bug, added example lines for iterator variant.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Python (2.5) source code. The code needs to be reviewed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def findmax(a):

    if len(a) == 0:
        return 0

    curr_max = a[0]

    for i in a:
        if i &gt; curr_max:
            curr_max = i

    return curr_max
&lt;/source&gt;

Simple example of how to use the function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print findmax( [12, 13, 555, 124, 342] )
&lt;/source&gt;

Output should be: 555


Another way to implement the algorithm:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def imax( iterable, key=lambda x: x ):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;returns largest item, as input could take iterator or sequence
    &quot;key&quot; function will be applied on every item, before comparison is made
    &gt;&gt;&gt; imax( [12,3,4, 89, 90,88] )
    90
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    current_max = None
    for x in iterable:
        if current_max is None or key(x) &gt; key( current_max ):
            current_max = x
    return current_max
&lt;/source&gt;

Simple example of how to use the function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print imax( [12, 13, 555, 124, 342] )
print imax( [12, 13, 555, 124, 342], lambda x: 1.0/x )
&lt;/source&gt;

==User testing==

{{Adfexemplar| Power monitoring | Hamish Dobson and Tim Grieve for Austin Brothers Electrical |


Our client experiences problems with the quality of power supplied to electrical equipment from the electricity provider. This affects the operational efficiency of specialist electrical equipment in the farming industry such as pumps and electric motors. In the past solving such faults has relied on educated guesses and experimentation often resulting in wasted man hours and materials. The problems experienced have created a need for an Information Technology solution to be able to accurately monitor and record various electrical statistics to aid in the efficient resolution of these problems.

{{cquote| Using the Recording Voltmeter we can now gain an accurate picture of line conditions over a period of time...
The recording Voltmeter has solved our problem by providing us with the information we need at a financially viable cost}}

The operating environment of the voltmeter is extremely challenging.  A very robust design was needed to withstand dirt and water over months of field trials before the project was completed.

This project developed a  hardware device to measure various aspects of water quality, and send the results of those measurements to a central computer (in real time). Intended for use in remote locations, the components of the bouy were extensively bench tested (on a windowsill) before field testing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Adfexemplar | Marine Quest | Alastair Nicholl, Liz Coup and Janey Labes for Portobello Aquarium, with artist Serge Ratten |

[[Image:Mq_menu_initial.jpg |left]] Our initial idea was to create a main menu that had different islands for different games. We wanted the user to be able to navigate to each island by steering the boat.


[[Image:Mq_menu_islands.jpg |left]]
We added all of the islands so that we could  see how it would work and how many there would be. We discussed at length whether to have a bird’s eye perspective or a first person perspective. We looked at different ways for the user to interact, either by steering the boat or by clicking on the individual island. 

[[Image:Mq_menu_boat.jpg |left ]] This was an alternative menu system. It uses text around the
Boat’s steering wheel. When the user clicked on a Game, the boat would steer and drive to
that island. 


[[Image:Mq_menu_txt.jpg |left]] This was an alternative text based menu option which was presented to the client. However the client much preferred the graphical menu.

[[Image:Mq_menu_storyboard.jpg |left]] After presenting the client with the alternative menu options, we decided to use the graphical islands concept for the Main Menu. We further developed the idea of this concept by drawing up a more detailed version of the island menu. These included additional details such as specifications for backgrounds, music and sounds.

[[Image:Mq_menu_islands_detail.jpg |left]]Each of the islands was based on an existing educational  programme offered by the Marine Studies Centre. We incorporated an island for each of the 6 primary programmes.   We added the “Games” island as a place to put the extra games we had designed. The idea at this stage was that children would be able to use the treasure they had earned playing the educational games and “spend it” on this island.


The group received funding for an artist to implement their wireframes and specifications. 


(This story continues in [[Software_Engineering_with_an_Agile_Development_Framework/Iteration_Three/Content_production]], where the Group employed an artist).

[[Image:Serge_rotates.jpg |400px| left]] The artist initially came back with a radically different design where the screen rotated when clicked so that each island could be accessed. We felt that this concept was not user friendly as the functionality and affordances were not obvious. We wanted all of the islands to be presented in the Main Menu at once. We gave this feedback to the artist, who was receptive, and he created a second version that closely matched what was outlined on the storyboards.

[[Image:Serge_sketch.jpg |left]]

[[Image:Mq_early_menu.jpg]|left]]
[[Image:Mq_menu_release.jpg |left]] This version was released in second iteration. Visually, it appears to be the same as the previous version, but has been optimized significantly. This involved reformatting the flash file and changing the sequence of layers, removing unnecessary tweens, and adding the functionality of loading individual games. When this version was released to the client, we included the Rock Pool Relatives game. We wanted to test the navigation of the Main Menu, so left the individual game icons on the sub islands enabled. When the user clicked on the icons, they were presented with a “Found Game” screen so they would know that a game was to be added in that location at a later date.



The Group had decided to develop games incrementally.  The functional delivery of iteration two had a subset of games. More were added in Iteration 3, along with a reworking of much code for optimisation and delivery.

[[Image:Mq_menu_final.jpg]] An intermediate version was again more robust (not shown). They improvement in this version was the way that the games were loaded into the main menu. This version had three games integrated with the main men; Rock Pool Relatives, Crab Feeding  Utensils, and Let’s Get Fishy!. In addition this version included functionality for the treasure.
This is the third version that was released to the client. This version changed screen sizes from 700x400 to the 700x525 which uses the same proportions as an 800x600 screen (which is the
screen size that we are developing for).  This version had five robust games, Rock Pool
Relatives, Crab Feeding Utensils, Let’s Get Fishy, Who Lives Here? and Sharky shark. Credits were also added to this version.

At the top of each page in this section it currently shows Cookbooks | Recipes | Kitchen Tools | etc.
There should be another entry called Menus which joins together various of the Recipes.  Menus
could be separated by Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Parties, Kids Parties, etc.</text>

===Overview of analytical preparation===
Chemical analysis of brines maybe complicated by salinity effects and by the interfering effects of the various ions in solution.So, before actually running an analysis, stop and consider your sample matrix and the tests you wish to undertake.

===The basics===
Unpack the container of brine/water samples and look for any analysis requests, sampling logs or chains of custody and other documentation.Make a note of which tests are required and the quantity of the sample. 


Is there enough sample to conduct all tests separately? If not, are there some tests that can be run sequentially on samples without affecting later tests? For example, SG and temperature may be read with a hydrometer and thermometer prior to other tests. Be aware that reading pH with a meter should be conducted AFTER other tests such as EC and SG, as the reference electrode in the meter contains KCl.


What analytical equipment will you need? If you need an oven, spectrophotometer or scales, these require warming up. Turn them on now. 

===The sample===

Consider the samples. What do you know about them? Do you know enough about the sample matrix to determine the dilutions required to prevent interferences from affecting the method you plan to use? 


Is there any literature that describes existing typical analyses (major ions) of the sample matrix? Seawater-derived brines of known specific gravity are well described in Baseggio (1974). Brines from inland salt lake brines are less well known, but if there have been any typical analyses conducted on your brine previously, they will helpfully inform your analytical decisions. Information on brines derived from groundwaters  may be available from government agency online bore monitoring databases.  For example, in South Australia PIRSA and DLWBC have online databases that contain information from groundwater bores that form a network across the state. 


If there is no existing information on the sample matrix, what tests will you need to conduct to determine the level of interferences? You may need to analyse first for the interference you suspect, take an EC/pH reading, and/or run the samples along with some matrix spikes. At a minimum, determining the specific gravity of the brine with a hydrometer will give you a helpful pointer regarding these necessary salinity dilutions you may need.

===Dilutions, sample size and extra preparation===

Very high dilutions are not good practice.  Each time you halve the concentration of the sample you essentially double the size of the minimum practical quantation limit.  Use the smallest dilution that will provide you with reliable results. Using the test methods you have available, will any dilutions be small enough to still provide a useful minimum practical quantation level? You may need to utilise a quick 'dip test' such as the Merck phosphate strips to characterise the sample, allowing you to estimate appropriate dilutions. If you are not sure that you have selected an appropriate dilution, consider &quot;bracketing&quot; the sample dilution. that is, make 3 dilutions including your best estimate, a large dilution and a smaller dilution. The use of standard additions is also recommended if you are unsure about the salinity and other interferences your sample matrix presents. See your test method, Eaton ''et al'' 1995, or any good chemistry manual for details on the technique of standard addition.

 
When doing titrations, use the information obtained from your consideration of the samples to determine what sample size you need to test and what approximate volume of titre and size of burette will be appropriate for the sample.


Determine if the samples need additional preparation before they can be tested (eg water or acid extraction for soils, and digestions for some water/brine parameters). 

===Method familiarisation===

Get out the test method documentation (including any extraction/digestion processes) and become familiar with all the requirements. Read it right through and consider what you will need to do in each step.


Check:
# that you have  laid out a page in your lab notebook with the sample details and the tests in the order you will conduct them, 
# that you have sufficient reagents to test all your samples, 
# that you have all the necessary labware for the number of samples for each step of the procedure, 
# that all the equipment (scales, ovens, spectrophotometers, environmental chambers, incubators etc) is ready, turned on and/or warmed up, 
# that any scales being used have been checked against a known mass and calibrated if necessary, 
# that any meters being used have been calibrated, 
 
===Ready, steady, go...===

Lay out the equipment and reagents for the first analysis, and start the analysis.

==Informational Literacy With ELL Learners==

Informational literacy is important to all learners but has special importance for the job of TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) and ELLs (English Language Learners). This type of learner is not only learning the academic aspects of the content material, but also learning linguistic proficiency of another language.

==Topics==

ELL learner's perception of literacy. 

Types of ELL literacy learners. 

Key characteristics of effective instructional techniques for ELL learners. 

Use of technology within the classroom with the ELL learner. 


==ELL Learner's Perception of Literacy==

With the ELL learner information must be presented in a way to scaffold the process of academic inquiry. &quot;To be most effective, students will also need understandings of traditional information structures as well as understandings of the shifts in the way knowledge is built and organized.&quot; (Valenza, 2007) If we as the teacher can present the material in a way which is easily understood and accessible to the ELL learner then we can help them communicate more effectively and succeed in learning any subject presented to them. Scaffolding should be part of the instruction with the ELL learner and [http://www.ncte.org/library/files/Free/Journals/vm/VM0111Scaffolds.pdf scaffolding with the ELL learner (PDF)] is a comprehensive site to examine this type of instruction. A valuable resource for information literacy and instruction with a ELL is [http://www.everythingesl.net/ everythingESL]. Both of these online resources have good informational materials to help the educator in the classroom and win the confidence of the ELL with instruction.



==Types of ELL Literacy Learners==

There are three types of ELL that have been identified by researchers Olsen and Jaramillo (1999) and Ruiz de Velasco et al. (2000) The types of learners include:long term English learners;recent arrivals with limited schooling;and English learners with interrupted formal schooling.

Long term English learners are successful with conversational English with peers, teachers and others. Many have not had a consistent program for English language learning and content academic subject areas. Content knowledge is limited due to constraints of academic knowledge in math, science or social studies. There is a positive perception that they are doing well because they receive B's and C's on their report card, but scores poorly on state mandated tests.

Recent arrivals with limited formal schooling speak limited English or are not able to function with conversational English in social settings. They have limited formal schooling for English and other content academic subject areas. They have limited or no knowledge of academic English and subject matter to succeed in school. Poor perception of school and score poorly on state mandated tests due to lack of content knowledge. (Freeman &amp; Freeman, 2004)


==Key Characteristics of Effective Instructional Techniques for ELL Learners==

There are some key instructional strategies that can be used with the ELL learner in the classroom to make them successful with their academic learning. Based on research some effective techniques have been found to include some common strategies to include: collaboration, include background experiences of the student and the use of scaffolding for example using graphic organizers has proven to be an effective method to organize information. (Freeman &amp; Freeman, 2004)

Concerns about the content/evolution are valid and should be made clear to the people working on it (without putting the &quot;community&quot; spot light on it), as such VFD shouldn't be a first choice for it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Exceptions occur when the interpreter detects an
error in the code. These errors could be syntax
errors or semantic errors. You've seen the
aftermath of exceptions before: undefined variable
exceptions, divide by zero exceptions, and so on.

When an exception is generated, it is said to be ''raised'' or
''thrown''. Unless the exception is caught, it 
terminates proccessing of the current function call,
then propagates upward, terminating the processing
of the function that made the call, and so on and so on.

Unless the exception is ''caught'' (see the next section),
the exception eventually terminates the Sway interpreter
if executing a file. If Sway is running interactively,
the processing terminates up to, but not including,
the prompt-read-eval loop (the one with the &lt;tt&gt;sway&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
and &lt;tt&gt;more&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; prompts).

== Handling exceptions ==

It is possible to stop the propagation of an exception
by using the ''catch'' function. The sole argument
to ''catch'' is an expression that may generate an exception.
The ''catch'' function evaluates its argument and, 
if no exception was raised, returns the value of the
evaluated expression. 
If an exception was raised, ''catch'' converts the
exception into an ''error'' object.

Here is a typical use of catch:

    var x = catch(process(a,b));
    
    if (x is :ERROR &amp;&amp; x . type == :mathError)
        {
        x = 0;
        }
    else if (x is :ERROR)
        {
        throw(x);
        }
    
    ...

Note that if you catch an exception but it turns out
you don't wish to handle it, you can rethrow it with
the ''throw'' function.

== Throwing exceptions ==

You can generate your own exceptions with a different
use of the ''throw'' function. This use of ''throw'' requires
two arguments. These arguments can be anything, but, by
convention, the first argument is a symbol and the
second is a string giving more explanation concerning
the error. For example, suppose you wish raise an
exception if a variable is supposed to be even and
it's not:

    if (x % 2 == 1)
        {
        throw(:oddValue,&quot;x is &quot; + x + &quot;, it should be even.&quot;);
        }

== Try catch blocks ==

If you include the '''''basics''''' library,
you can use the '''try'' function, which simplifies
the catching and processing of exceptions. Here is
a version of the typical usage shown previously:

    var error;
    
    ...
    
    try (error)
        {
        x = process(a,b);
        }
    else if (error . type ==  :mathError)
        {
        x = 0;
        }
    else
        {
        throw(error);
        }
    
    ...

The ''try'' function requires that a variable be passed as the
first argument;
it will set this variable to the caught
exception, should an exception occur.

== Returns are exceptions ==

The ''return'' function generates a
special exception of type ''':return''', so the expression

    return x + y;
    
is equivalent to:

    throw(:return,x + y);

Since a return is ultimately an exception,
encountering a return causes an immediate
end to the processing of the body of a function.

This exception, however, is caught by the part of
the interpreter that sets up the function call and
is not allowed to propagate further.

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

Please continue with this Sumerian language book! I've learned more in the last two days about the Sumerian language than in the last two years staring that texts and translations. Thank you!

== Added Lesson 6 ==

Thanks for the comment! It spurred me to add a new lesson, which you can find in the usual place. It walks you through a real Sumerian sentence from the literary work &quot;Enki's journey to Nibru&quot;. Hope you enjoy it! [[User:Mike.the.kitty|Mike.the.kitty]] ([[User talk:Mike.the.kitty|talk]]) 16:19, 24 July 2008 (UTC)

== Great Primer! ==

I posted this comment under one of the lessons, and I'm re-posting here.

This is one of the best language intros (of any kind) that I've read. You've done a wonderful job of explaining what Sumerian is about, without forcing the reader to slog through a lot of technical details right up front. Most language texts give short shrift to the student's need to get the &quot;lie of the land&quot; before burying him in mechanics.

Many thanks!

== Thanks :) ==

I'm glad you enjoyed it! I can't take too much credit for this style of grammar, though - it's more or less known as the &quot;inductive&quot; style of teaching, where you actually throw out real pieces of text and explain them a little bit at a time, slowly building up to the more complicated things. There's a great inductive grammar for Sumerian by John Hayes that I would really recommend - unlike this one, it focuses more on the ability to actually read tablets from the very first lesson!

Your comment has spurred me to start a new chapter. I'll get a first revision up sometime in the next couple weeks, if all goes well. Until then, keep on discovering! [[User:Mike.the.kitty|Mike.the.kitty]] ([[User talk:Mike.the.kitty|talk]]) 14:55, 2 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
void srand( unsigned seed );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function srand() is used to seed the random sequence generated by [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/rand|rand]](). For any given ''seed'', [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/rand|rand]]() will generate a specific &quot;random&quot; sequence over and over again.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
srand( time(NULL) );
for( i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ )
  printf( &quot;Random number #%d: %d\n&quot;, i, rand() );
&lt;/source&gt;

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
int rand( void );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/rand|rand]]() returns a pseudo-random integer between zero and '''RAND_MAX'''. An example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
srand( time(NULL) );
for( i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ )
  printf( &quot;Random number #%d: %d\n&quot;, i, rand() ); 
&lt;/source&gt;

The rand() function must be seeded before its first call with the [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/srand|srand]]() function - otherwise it will consistently return the same numbers when the program is restarted. 

{{NOTE|The generation of '''random numbers''' is essential to [[Cryptography|cryptography]]. Any [[Wikipedia:stochastic process|stochastic process]] (generation of random numbers) simulated by a computer, however, is not truly random, but pseudorandom; that is, the randomness of a computer is not from random radioactive decay of an unstable chemical isotope, but from predefined stochastic process, this is why this function needs to be seeded.}}

      <comment>the solo guitarist in jazz was always around but Django and Charlie Christian were also adept at playing chordal accompaniment - Solo Flight was not the norm for Jazz at that time (big band period) - so emphasizing the roots of jazz guitar are rhythmic</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Jazz Basics== 

'''Jazz Chords: '''

Early jazz bands relied on the banjo because of its ability to match the volume of the other instruments. The guitar was soon to replace the banjo as the rhythmic string instrument favored in a jazz ensemble. Early jazz guitarists tended to play block chords to provide the rhythmic support which was once the role of the banjo. These early jazz guitarists had to adopt a very economical chordal style to match some of the fast tempos they were expected to play. This involved three or four note chords and the legacy of this is to be found in all jazz guitar styles. Here are three moveable exercises illustrating the basic jazz chord vocabulary:

&lt;u&gt;'''Exercise One: Four Note Jazz Chords In Root Position'''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=4&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;



'''Jazz Forms''' Any student of jazz has to be familiar with the two main forms: the twelve bar blues and the [[w:thirty-two-bar form|thirty-two-bar ballad]]. A very famous thirty-two bar song is &quot;Misty&quot; by Errol Garner and many other jazz standards also use this form. Jazz musicians have also used the twelve-bar blues form extensively.   

'''Fake Book''' Fake Books are collections of jazz standards (tunes that are in most musicians' repertoires) by the likes of Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Bud Powell, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, etc.  You should start by getting a Fake Book and recordings of the tunes.  Listen to the songs and get a general feel for the jazz style.

Note that a fakebook is a good aid for learning tunes, but professional jazz musicians are expected to develop a large repertoire of memorized tunes.  It is also helpful to learn tunes in every key, though the fakebook will usually present them in the most common key.  This approach has two benefits: one, it forces you to consider the relationships between the chords rather than simply memorizing the chord names to play; and two, many singers perform tunes in keys other than the &quot;book key.&quot;

'''Jazz Style''' Jazz rhythms are meant to swing. While not all jazz consists of swinging rhythms (some may have a straight eighth feel) it is important to become familiar with this style of playing. Swing is a difficult style to notate because it involves pulling and pushing against the beat; so students approach jazz by listening to the music first. If you are new to jazz then the song &quot;My Favourite Things&quot; from the musical &lt;i&gt;The Sound Of Music&lt;/i&gt; is a good place to start. Listen to John Coltrane's jazz version and compare it against the original soundtrack version. You will notice that the original version swings less and that Coltrane's version lasts longer than the original. Jazz musicans are expected to be able to improvise around a melody and this is exactly what Coltrane does; extending the song and melody beyond its original form. The drums and piano on Coltrane's version definetly swing in comparison to the backing instruments of the original. Swing may be a difficult style to describe on paper but its very easy to hear. 

The use of octaves is a common technique in jazz guitar. Once a jazz guitarist has learnt the notes to a melody, say &quot;Summertime&quot;, they will then play the same melody using octaves. Audiences hear octaves as a single melodic line and therefore using octaves is a highly effective technique for re-inforcing the melody line. Jazz guitarists are also very adept at playing scales backwards. The jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell on the album &lt;i&gt;Midnight Blue&lt;/i&gt; uses simple minor pentatonic scales to great effect starting on their highest note and descending through the scale to the lowest note. Kenny Burrell may also open a solo with a backwards minor pentatonic scale. Playing scales backwards is a technique that provides for surprise openings, unusual bridges and tension releasing. 

Many famous early jazz guitarists cited horn players as a major influence. The rise of jazz coincided with the development of radio and the gramophone and early recordings of jazz played a major role in developing the main stylistic elements of the genre. Louis Armstrong's &quot;West End Blues&quot; (Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five - 1928) is considered one of the masterpieces of early jazz and cemented the role of the brass soloist forever in jazz. Jazz guitarists of the day took note and soon it became standard practice for guitarists to copy &quot;horn riffs&quot;. Charlie Christian (Benny Goodman Band 1930s) is still considered by many as one of the great players of the instrument with many of his riffs displaying &quot;horn-like&quot; qualities. Christian also played a role in the development of Be-Bop participating in ''jams'' with Dizzy Gillespie and Theolonius Monk at Minton's Playhouse in New York (1941) which were recorded by a jazz fan. These recordings represent the transition from Swing to Be-Bop and offer a rare chance to hear the informal &quot;after-hours&quot; meetings of some of the greatest players in jazz.  A good jazz guitarist will normally have a few &quot;horn riffs&quot; in his vocabulary. Try playing along to a Miles Davis or John Coltrane recordings; choose a slow tempo ballad. Brass instruments are melodic instruments and therefore, unlike the guitar, horn players cannot form chords. This means that horn players develop very strong melodic capabilties and focus and this provides an ideal opportuntiy for a guitarist to improve their lead guitar and melodic focus.

==Essential Jazz Guitarists and Recordings==
[[File:Pat Metheny Barcelona 2008.jpg|thumb|The jazz guitarist Pat Metheny; whose understated guitar style drew not only praise from jazz fans but also gained him a following from many who had no experience of jazz.]]
Here is a list of jazz guitarists every guitarist should know, in more-or-less chronological order.

* [[w:Charlie Christian|Charlie Christian]] was the first guitarist to popularize the electric guitar as a solo instrument in jazz.  Listen to the recordings he made with Benny Goodman in the late 1930s, including &quot;Solo Flight.&quot;
* [[w:Django Reinhardt|Django Reinhardt]] was a gypsy jazz guitarist who played swinging single-note lines on the acoustic guitar.  Listen to his recordings with the Hot Club of France from the late 1930s.
* [[w:Tal Farlow|Tal Farlow]] brought the harmonic and melodic innovations of the [[w:Bebop|Bebop]] style of jazz to the guitar.  His mid-1950s recordings are recommended listening.
* [[w:Jim Hall|Jim Hall]] brought a motif-based style of improvisational development to the jazz guitar.  His recordings with Bill Evans are an excellent starting point.
* [[w:Wes Montgomery|Wes Montgomery]] is renowned for his horn-like single lines, innovative octaves, and 'impossible' chord solos.  The three essential Wes Montgomery recordings, all from the early 1960s, are &lt;i&gt;The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Full House&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Smokin' At The Half Note&lt;/i&gt;.
* [[w:George Benson|George Benson]] is known for his improvisation as well as his more popular later works.  Listen to his work with organists [[w:Jack McDuff|Jack McDuff]] and [[w:Dr. Lonnie Smith|Dr. Lonnie Smith]].
* [[w:Pat Martino|Pat Martino]] is known for his fluid single-line improvisation.  A good introduction to his playing is &lt;i&gt;Live At Yoshi's&lt;/i&gt;, featuring organist [[w:Joey DeFrancesco|Joey DeFrancesco]] and drummer [[w:Billy Hart|Billy Hart]].
* [[w:Joe Pass|Joe Pass]] was a great improvisor, but he is known especially for his solo chord-melody arrangements of jazz standards.  Essential listening includes the &quot;Virtuoso&quot; series of recordings which showcase his solo pieces.
* [[w:John McLaughlin|John McLaughlin]] is known as a pioneering jazz-rock guitarist.  His work in the 1970s with the [[w:Mahavishnu Orchestra|Mahavishnu Orchestra]] should be considered essential listening.
* [[w:John Scofield|John Scofield]] is known for his angular lines and use of dissonance.  For new jazz listeners, his two recordings with [[w:Medeski Martin and Wood|Medeski Martin and Wood]] are probably the best introduction to his playing.
* [[w:Allan Holdsworth|Allan Holdsworth]] is a jazz-rock guitarist known for his peerless technique and his unique approach to harmony.  &quot;Believe It,&quot; a mid-1970s jazz-rock recording by the New Tony Williams Lifetime, and &quot;None Too Soon,&quot; a more straight-ahead jazz recording under Holdsworth's name, are both essential listening.
* [[w:Pat Metheny|Pat Metheny]] is known for his small-group work as well as his work with the Pat Metheny Group.  A good introduction to his playing is the record &quot;Bright Size Life,&quot; which also features electric bassist [[w:Jaco Pastorius|Jaco Pastorius]].

==Jazz Movement Exercises==
These three exercises lend themselves to the 12-bar blues form. They are designed to aid movement along the fretboard and to give the student the chance to practice applying one chord on each beat of a bar.

&lt;u&gt;'''Jazz Movement Exercise One'''&lt;/u&gt;

===Environment report===
Environmental report

The environment the project will be finally used in, will vary from very quiet when only a few people are viewing it, to very noisy when a school trip views the exhibit. The target project audience is most likely to be very noisy when in numbers. The overall temperature will be fairly constant due to the air conditioning required by the butterflies. Lighting will also be constant, as the project will be indoors, and can be easily controlled. In the habitat there will be a constant temperature of around 28 degrees Celsius with 90% humidity with the temperature only dropping slightly over night. There should be no obvious problems caused by the climate due to the fact that any hardware will be contained entirely inside or entirely outside the habitat.

===storyboard===
Storyboarding was vital to our development. As we all hated documentation, we used storyboards as often as possible which saved a lot of time and misunderstanding as we could all see what others were thinking.

Interface storyboards had multiply stages where many details were changed and many potential problems were found. Most of the storyboarding was done in the first three months with almost post storyboards done on whiteboards in the main being small modification to the original storyboards

The following storyboard was used for presentation to show the client an overall design concept and to illustrate our current understanding of the interface requirements. The final product has two main changes from the following storyboard, there is no VR section instead there is a third person flyer section and the projection display has become the final section. Nether of these changes require any storyboarding to implement so no was ever made. 

===Functional requirements===

Functional Requirements
'' 
{|
|''||REQUIREMENT
THE SYSTEM SHALL||DESCRIPTION
|-
|FR 1||Allow the museum to have an interactive software activity based on butterflies.||The museum provides a learning experience for museum\’s visitors.
|-
|FR 2||Allow people to create their own virtual butterfly.||Features will be provided to allow people to design their own butterfly.
|-
|FR 3||Allow a butterfly entered into the database to be retrieved by its creator.||A database will keep butterflies so that people can come back and see them again.
|-
|FR 4||Limit the amount of time a user can use the system.||To keep the line moving so many people can use the system.
|-
|FR 5||Appeal to both adults and children.||The need to appeal to the greatest number of people is an import factor
|-
|FR 6||Butterflies shall fly and move around and interact with the environment.||To make the display interesting to watch and a better overall experience
|-
|FR 7||Butterflies will be deleted after a set amount of time.||To free up resources for more butterflies and to complete the life cycle. Database files will remain but de-activate because it is bad practice to delete any thing of a database.
|-
|FR 8||Show the natural life cycle. ||The complete life cycle of a Butterfly showing the four major stages
|-
|FR 9||Cater for ages 8 and up.||Able to be used by most people above the age of 8 without aid.
|-
|FR10||Flexible enough to handle a different topic.||The overall design should be able to handle being changed to display another concept
|-
|FR11||Give users the opportunity to take something home that relates to the exhibit.||The museum wants their visitors to have something physical to take away to inform whilst advertising the museum and the tropical house so as to generate new and repeat visits.
|-
|FR12||Must have a shutdown procedure for when the power is turned off.||There are many powered displays in a museum. A shutdown sequence is more complex than a switch therefore its desirable. 
|-
|FR13||Must have a start-up procedure for when power is turned on.||The same as shut down. Power on is as complex a task that should be ask of museum staff when start the display.
|-
|FR14||Have a type of screensaver.||Screensaver will be needed because the monitors will be running for long hours.  Also there is a need for a &quot;screen saver&quot; loop to entice and inform users to the product.
|-
|
|-
|C1||Should not appear as a computer to users.||Most people find computers can be intimidating, boring or common. All of which are not aspects that are likely to enthral users to interact with them. 
|-
|C2||Run unattended and be maintenance free.||Due to the fact that there will be very little maintenance available for long periods of time, there is a great need for the system to run without the need of regular attendance.
|-
|C3||Be completely robust.||Able to withstand the wear and tear of a museum interactive exhibit.
|-
|C 5||Show version number etc on start-up.||A version number is needed so there is no confusion to what version of software/ hardware is currently operating. Important when servicing or upgrading software.
|-
|C6||Function normally within a humid and varying environment. ||28˚C and a humidity of 90% are the conditions within the butterfly house. The system may also be installed for a time in the museum foyer other areas which may have varying conditions.
|-
|C7||Be able to handle up to 1000 users a day.||The number of visitor to the museum is very erratic due to the likes of holidays and weather. It is also common to have large group visits such as tour or school groups. This mean that the system may have times that it is constant use throughout a day or not at all. 
|-
|C8||Offer different levels of information ||Able to cater for those who want to know more.
|-
|C9||Offer the user a reason to return||Some reason that a user will repeatedly return to the exhibit.
|-

Project executive summary

The goal of this project is to provide a dispatch system for City Taxis.  The Dispatch System should be ready for use as soon as possible.

We are using a methodology that combines iterative and Agile thinking.  We believe that understanding grows throughout a project, therefore through the use of prototyping and regular meetings with stakeholders, constructive feedback will be created to ensure the implementation of a successful system.  The system should facilitate dispatches and provide historical records.  

Main risks identified so far include: lack of compliance to legislation, loss of privacy, inaccurate data, insecure data..

Section Three: Methodology
Project Methodology

The Agile methodology encourages realistic schedules and resource allocation, allows for changing requirements and technical complexity of projects.   It also takes into account technical shortfalls of group members and access to appropriate technology.
Phased life-cycle approach to help the group realize what activities are to be undertaken, what deliverables for each stage may be, enable different types of communication between activities and different stages, determine whether deliverables of each stage are satisfactory prior to proceeding to the next stage.
The relative quickness of each cycle means that the team and client are revisiting the stages of the project a number of times, and therefore there is a higher probability of completing a project that satisfies the client.  This also allows the flexibility to adjust to the changing client/ project needs.
Regular use of “Scrum” meetings (15 minute regular meetings between team members, and client) facilitates a high standard of communication between team members and the client, and keeps the focus on what is happening next and who is doing what.
The use of prototypes allows the client to kinesthetically experience the development of the project at regular intervals.  This promotes constructive feedback from the client, and increases the probability of the project moving in a direction that meets the stakeholders requirements.
Because construction and evaluation is happening throughout the project, there is a greater likelihood that the finished product will meet the stakeholders’ needs.
Understanding is not expected to be obtained by all parties early in the project.  It is expected that as all parties are involved in a constructing, evaluating process; understanding will continue to growSection 
 

Project Outline

Project Description

City Taxis needs an improved dispatch system that facilitates taxi dispatches easily and successfully, while accurately recording all data needed.
The main hub of City Taxis consists of phone operators and a sole dispatcher.  The phone operators deal with customer bookings.  The dispatcher allocates the jobs and communicates with the drivers.
The current system seems to facilitate the dispatch jobs quite well in the office environment, but at a high financial cost.
The current communication system between the taxi drivers and the main office, seems to have time delays and distracts the drivers more than what is considered necessary.
The ability to store data that is easily accessible is paramount, as future legislative requirements specify that certain data is accessible by police.
The immediate desire of the client is that a system is put in place that accurately records the dispatch data for future reference, while providing an easy to use front-end interface.
  
Project risks
Software development is intrinsically risky and uncertain which is why we need clear and measurable goals at the start of the project.  The main project risks include the inability of software to perform to expectations of users and the inability of software developers to produce a working or functioning system for users.  Also:

•	Failure to gain user commitment
•	Lack of adequate user involvement
•	Misunderstanding user requirements
•	Failure to manage end user expectations
•	Conflict between different users
•	Inadequate user training
•	Running out of time

Green Card, Red Card
Early on in the process we left a card system for City Taxis staff to use to comment on their current system. Things they like could be written on green cards, things for improvements on red cards.

Discussion 23 July

•	A booking always requires a phone number and a name
•	Situations are going to occur where there is no street address. In this case, the pickup needs to have a location which is to be given a suburb and an area
•	In theory, it doesn’t matter if there are duplicate  location entries in the address table
•	Shortcut do not dynamically updates, and would have their own interface for editing
•	Instructions is an optional field
•	Address numbers are not compulsory
•	Rules that apply to pickup also apply to destination
•	Vehicle type is an optional field and by default is blank
•	Time required is compulsory and defaults to current time
•	Number of passengers is optional
•	Large boot is to be removed from the form
•	True value for Bike Rack will generate “, Bike Rack” to be concatenated into the vehicle type field of the dispatch screen. This happens when dispatch data is generated
•	A booking requires both a pickup and a destination

Current State of Booking Form
•	Data does not get recorded properly if there is no street name
•	There are currently no booking validation processes, anything appears go in regardless of how little data there is, although no data is created if some pieces of data are missing
•	If a blank booking is made no data goes through, yet the dialog “Booking Saved” is displayed
•	A booking requires a pickup and a destination address otherwise no new data is recorded

TaxiDispatch Functional Release

13 August 2007

Before going to City Taxis I made a last minute change to the code on the booking form to make phone numbers optional. This suits their needs at the moment better.

On arrival I split the database putting the backend on a folder on the computer to be used as the dispatchers workstation, mapped as the “T: drive” on City Taxis’ local area network. I packaged up the frontend into an install file, and had the setup file created to a shared folder on our polytech computer. The program was installed on all machines on the City Taxis network and testing began.

Problems and suggestions arising from the test included:
•	Dispatch job screen not working correctly. Jobs will not clear if there is more than one on the screen. This is probably nothing more than a programming bug.
•	The are delays experienced after saving a booking or clearing the booking form of around three seconds. Most of the time this is OK but could be a problem during busy times. Even so at any time a three second delay is long enough to be annoying.
•	There is no ability to cancel a booking.
•	We haven’t facilitated for different vehicle types. No restrictions are imposed, meaning a booking can be made for 6 passengers in one car even though this is not physically possible.
•	The drop-down boxes to help with address details do not work with the down arrow key.
•	Special instructions do not appear to be going into the database.
•	Various corrections to the street database and additions to the list of location shortcuts were made, some still need to be made.
•	A suggestion was made for the next release that the dispatcher needs to be able to reposition a car on the board at any time.

I spent the first hour or so showing the booking form to the staff on duty and supervised their usage thereof. Afterwards I sat at the dispatchers desk watching dispatchers and generally made myself available to write down suggestions, comments, and problems. Some problems with data I was able to fix instantly on site using the polytech computer to access the backend and edit data on tables directly.

[[Image:Adftaxibulk20.jpg|400px|left]]

Ruled Out
•	Physical Board: not practical, does not fit in with needs of client

Combination  Options:
1.	Access tables + Access queries + Access forms
2.	SQL Server + Access queries + Access forms
3.	SQL Server + Stored procedures (SQL server) + Windows application
4.	SQL Server + ColdFusion + HTML
5.	Access tables + ColdFusion or PHP + HTML
6.	SQL Server + ColdFusion or PHP + Google Maps

Ruled Out
•	Option 6: Google maps does not match up with the requirements of the wireframe interface
•	Options 1 and 2: These options use Access forms which do not practically support the features of the wireframe interface
•	Options 4 and 5: These options use HTML as a front end. This does not have a proper coding environment, and would make for complicated and difficult attempt to support our wireframe interface

Leaving
•	Option 3: SQL Server + Stored procedures (SQL Server) + Windows application

The SQL server is the best suited backend because, unlike Access, it is designed for a multi user environment and has better stability and facilities for backups. It is also less restrictive in what we can do with the data.

Stored procedures on a SQL server would make a good logical layer because they are held close to the actually data, and once it is  created it will make front end development much easier. There is bigger scope for customised procedures to fit in with the needs of the front end.

A standalone windows application is also the best platform with which to make a front end, because as we will be designing and building it ourselves, we can make it meet our requirements. Microsoft Visual Studio is probably the best environment to code with, as it will have facilities to connect with a SQL server data source.

The above diagram also shows the coathanger concept where coathangers are used to rate each item.  The more green hangers an item has the more suitable that item is for the user, and the more red hangers an item has, the more unsuitable that item is for the user.  Hangers can also be half green and half red as the hanger rating comes off a suitability index so an item can be 3.5 coathangers out of 5.  We looked at using a colour slider bar for ranking items but decided to go with a star rating (using coathangers as that is unique) instead.

==Ingredients==
* 400g potatoes (about two potatoes)
* Knob of butter (1/4 cup)
* 3/4 cup plain flour
* Pinch of salt 
* Three peeled medium/small apples (or two peeled large apples)
* Two tablespoons sugar

Optional:
* 1.5 tsp cinnamon
* 1.5 tsp ground cloves

==Procedure==
#Peel the potatoes and quarter them.  Boil in water until the center is soft.  Drain the water and then leave the potatoes in the hot pan to dry out then mash them until smooth.  
# Rub the butter into the flour until it's crumbly.  Add salt and then mix in mashed potatoes. Knead for a few minutes.
# Divide in half and roll into two rounds. 
# Slice the apples and place in a pot, add the sugar (and cinnamon and cloves) and heat through for three minutes, remove from heat.
# Use the two disks of potato bread like a sandwich and place the apple mixture into the middle.
# Preheat a skillet pan with two tablespoons of oil and place the potato bread sandwich in it and cook for three minutes each side and serve straight away.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Adfexemplar | Fire room training | Grant Helm, Stuart Mathews, Ming Shen  for Fire Service|

We have developed a training aid system that displays captured thermal imaging video and body statistics of trainee fire-fighters that are wearing breathing apparatus in the hot fire training room at Dunedin central fire station. The fire room is in blackout conditions and operates at temperatures up to 300 degrees Celsius - significant challenges for IT systems!

The system developed by the group is a combination of procured hardware and software with developed middleware. An application was developed for a debrief session that visually displays thermal conditions during the exercise.

{{Adfexemplar | Occupational Therapy Simulation | Phil Brophy and Pam Murphy |

Despite a client insisting “a serious thing, no fun”, a game engine hides behind this project. A interactive system enables occupational therapy students to be in simulated practice decision making situations where they have to take the consequences of the decisions made. The system is flexible enough for the client to develop new scenarios and monitor student performance.

The introduction of digital technology throughout the editing, scheduling and broadcasting processes, allowed the station to provide better programming at convenient times to Dunedin viewers.

{{Adfexemplar |Talking with Leonardo | Chrissie Jackson and Jonathon Ung  for Otago Museum|

The Leonardo Talking Head robot is an interactive robot with a personality. The robot will accept speech and respond back. It is designed primarily for children and has the ability to educate users on the works and life of Leonardo.

In this sector, the group took the conversational interaction style developed in the previous sector and developed a system to generation such conversation. Initial designs were hierarchical but became iterative as progressed closer to code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As will be seen, the theory of Green's functions provides an extremely elegant procedure of solving differential equations. We wish to present here this method on a rigorous foundation. 

==The Dirac delta-function==
The Dirac delta-function &lt;math&gt;\delta (x)&lt;/math&gt;is not a function as it is ordinarily defined. However, we write it as if it were a function, keeping in mind the scope of the definition.

For any function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,we define 

&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\delta (x)dx=f(0)&lt;/math&gt; but for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{-\epsilon}f(x)\delta (x) dx=\int_{\epsilon}^{\infty}f(x)\delta (x) dx=0&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta (x)dx=1&lt;/math&gt;

These conditions seem to be satisfied by a &quot;function&quot; &lt;math&gt;\delta (x)&lt;/math&gt; which has value zero whenever &lt;math&gt;x\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, but has &quot;infinite&quot; value at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;

===Approximations===
There are a few ways to approximate the delta function in terms of sequences ordinary functions. We give two examples

====The Boxcar function====
[[Image:Boxcar function approximation.png|thumb|right|150px]]

The boxcar function &lt;math&gt;B_n:\mathbb{R}\to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;B_n(x) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; |x|&gt;\tfrac{1}{2n} \\ 1 &amp; |x|\leq\tfrac{1}{2n} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

We can see that the sequence &lt;math&gt;\left\langle B_n\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; represents an approximation to the delta function.

====The bell curve====
[[Image:Dirac function approximation.gif|thumb|right|100px]]

The delta function can also be approximated by the ubiquitous [[w:gaussian function|Gaussian]]. 

We write &lt;math&gt;G_n(x)=\frac{n}{\sqrt{\pi}} \mathrm{e}^{-x^2n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Green's function==
Consider an equation of the type &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}u(x)=F(x)&lt;/math&gt;...(1), where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''differential operator''. The functions &lt;math&gt;u,F&lt;/math&gt; may in general be functions of several independants, but for sake of clarity, we will write them here as if they were real valued. In most cases of interest, this equation can be written in the form

&lt;math&gt;a(x)\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}+b(x)\frac{du}{dx}+c(x)=F(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be solved for &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; in some closed set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt; being non-zero over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;

Now, it so happens, that in problems of physics, it is much more convenient to solve the equation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}u(x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the delta function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\delta (x-x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, the solution of the operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Green's function''' &lt;math&gt;G(x,x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. That is, 

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}G(x,x_0)=\delta (x-x_0)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, by the definition of the delta-function, we have that &lt;math&gt;F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(x')\delta(x'-x)dx&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;F(x')&lt;/math&gt; act as &quot;weights&quot; to the delta function.

Hence, we have, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}u(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(x')\mathcal{L}G(x,x')dx&lt;/math&gt;

Note here that&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is an operator that depends on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}u(x)=\mathcal{L}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(x')G(x,x')dx&lt;/math&gt;. We can view this as anologous to the inversion of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; and hence, we write 

&lt;math&gt;u_p(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(x')G(x,x')dx&lt;/math&gt;

The subscript &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; denotes that we have found a particular solution among the many possible. For example, consider any harmonic solution &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}u_h(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. 

If we add &lt;math&gt;u'(x)=u_h(x)+u_p(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;u'(x)&lt;/math&gt; is still a solution of (1). Thus, we have a class of functions satisfying (1).

===Boundary value problems===
Problems of physics are often presented as the operator equation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}u(x)=F(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be solved for &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; on a closed set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, together with the '''boundary condition''' that &lt;math&gt;u(x_b)=u_b(x_b)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x_b\in\partial A&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\partial A&lt;/math&gt; is the boundary of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;). 

&lt;math&gt;u_b(x_b)&lt;/math&gt; is a given function satisfying &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}u_b(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; that describes the behaviour of the solution at the boundary of the region of concern.

Thus if a problem is stated as 

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}u(x)=F(x)&lt;/math&gt; with

&lt;math&gt;u(x_b)=u_b(x_b)&lt;/math&gt;

to be solved for &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; over a closed set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,

The solution can be given as &lt;math&gt;u_S(x)=u_p(x)+u_b(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(x')G(x,x')dx+u_b(x)&lt;/math&gt;

==Green's functions from eigenfunctions==
Consider the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding eigenfunctions &lt;math&gt;\phi_n&lt;/math&gt; of the differential operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\phi_n=\lambda_n\phi_n&lt;/math&gt;

Without loss of generality, we assume that these eigenfunctions are orthogonal. Further, we assume that they form a basis. 

Thus, we can write &lt;math&gt;u(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n\beta_i\phi_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Now &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}u(x)=\mathcal{L}\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\phi_i=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\mathcal{L}\phi_i=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\lambda_i\phi_i=\sum_{i=1}^n\beta_i\phi_i=F(x)&lt;/math&gt; and hence, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i=\frac{\beta_i}{\lambda_i}&lt;/math&gt;

by definition of orthogonality, &lt;math&gt;\beta_n=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(x)\phi_n(x)dx=(F(x)\cdot\phi_n(x))&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;u(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\phi_i(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\beta_i}{\lambda_i}\phi_i(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{(F(x')\cdot\phi_i(x'))}{\lambda_i}\phi_i&lt;/math&gt;

and hence, we can write the Green's function as &lt;math&gt;G(x,x')=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\phi_i(x)\phi_i(x')}{\lambda_i}&lt;/math&gt;

=Whole Wheat Irish Soda Bread=

===Ingredients===

* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole-wheat]]
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]

===Directions===

# Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|325°F]], 165°C, gasmark 3.
# Use [[Cookbook:Cooking Spray|cooking spray]] or grease and then lightly flour a 9x5x3 [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|baking pan]].
# Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl.
# Form a cavity in the middle.
# Pour in the buttermilk.
# Mix until just moistened.  ''Too much mixing will make it tough.''
# Gently shape the dough to fit pan.
# Cut the top at least three times with a knife.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] for 65-70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the bread comes out clean.
# Cool on a wire rack.
# Wrap in tea-towel or foil several hours or overnight for best flavor.

===Tips, Notes, and Variations===

* If you're in a hurry, bake at 375°F for 35-40 minutes.
* I usually substitute a tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] in milk for the buttermilk.
* &quot;Baker's Secret&quot; is a brand of cooking spray that includes the flour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PLIP for Linux-2.2 ==

During development of the 2.1 kernel versions, support for the parallel port was changed to a better setup.

Kernel Compile Options:

             General setup  ---&gt;
                 [*] Parallel port support
             Network device support  ---&gt;
                 &lt;*&gt; PLIP (parallel port) support

The new code for PLIP behaves like the old one (use the same ifconfig and route commands as in the previous section, but initialization of the device is different due to the advanced parallel port support.  

The ``first'' PLIP device is always called ``plip0'', where first is the first device detected by the system, similarly to what happens for Ethernet devices. The actual parallel port being used is one of the available ports, as shown in /proc/parport. For example, if you have only one parallel port, you'll only have a directory called /proc/parport/0.

If your kernel didn't detect the IRQ number used by your port, ``insmod plip'' will fail; in this case just write the right number to /proc/parport/0/irq and reinvoke insmod.

Complete information about parallel port management is available in the file Documentation/parport.txt, part of your kernel sources.

If you are fortunate enough to have a semi permanent connection to the net and would like to have your machine automatically redial your PPP connection if it is lost then here is a simple trick to do so.  Configure PPP such that it can be started by the root user by issuing the command:

     # pppd

Be sure that you have the `-detach' option configured in your /etc/ppp/options file. Then, insert the following line into your /etc/inittab file, down with the getty definitions: 

     pd:23:respawn:/usr/sbin/pppd

This will cause the init program to spawn and monitor the pppd program and automatically restart it if it dies.

SLIP devices are named `sl0', `sl1' etc. with the first device configured being assigned `0' and the rest incrementing sequentially as they are configured.

Kernel Compile Options:

             Network device support  ---&gt;
                 [*] Network device support
                 &lt;*&gt; SLIP (serial line) support
                 [ ]  CSLIP compressed headers
                 [ ]  Keepalive and linefill
                 [ ]  Six bit SLIP encapsulation

SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) allows you to use tcp/ip over a serial line, be that a phone line with a dialup modem, or a leased line of some sort.  Of course to use SLIP you need access to a SLIP- server in your area. Many universities and businesses provide SLIP access all over the world.

Slip uses the serial ports on your machine to carry IP datagrams. To do this it must take control of the serial device. Slip device names are named sl0, sl1 etc. How do these correspond to your serial devices ? The networking code uses what is called an ioctl (i/o control) call to change the serial devices into SLIP devices. There are two programs supplied that can do this, they are called dip and slattach 

== dip ==

dip (Dialup IP) is a smart program that is able to set the speed of the serial device, command your modem to dial the remote end of the link, automatically log you into the remote server, search for messages sent to you by the server and extract information for them such as your IP address and perform the ioctl necessary to switch your serial port into SLIP mode. dip has a powerful scripting ability and it is this that you can exploit to automate your logon procedure.You can find it at: metalab.unc.edu.

To install it, try the following:

             user% tar xvzf dip337o-uri.tgz
             user% cd dip-3.3.7o
             user% vi Makefile
             root# make install

The Makefile assumes the existence of a group called uucp, but you might like to change this to either dip or SLIP depending on your configuration.

== slattach ==

slattach as contrasted with dip is a very simple program, that is very easy to use, but does not have the sophistication of dip.  It does not have the scripting ability, all it does is configure your serial device as a SLIP device. It assumes you have all the information you need and the serial line is established before you invoke it. slattach is ideal to use where you have a permanent connection to your server, such as a physical cable, or a leased line.

== When do I use which ? ==

You would use dip when your link to the machine that is your SLIP server is a dialup modem, or some other temporary link. You would use slattach when you have a leased line, perhaps a cable, between your machine and the server and there is no special action needed to get the link working. See section `Permanent Slip connection' for more information. 
 
Configuring SLIP is much like configuring an Ethernet interface (read section `Configuring an ethernet device' above). However there are a few key differences.

First of all, SLIP links are unlike ethernet networks in that there is only ever two hosts on the network, one at each end of the link.  Unlike an ethernet that is available for use as soon are you are cabled, with SLIP, depending on the type of link you have, you may have to initialize your network connection in some special way.

If you are using dip then this would not normally be done at boot time, but at some time later, when you were ready to use the link.  It is possible to automate this procedure. If you are using slattach then you will probably want to add a section to your rc.inet1 file.  This will be described soon.

There are two major types of SLIP servers: Dynamic IP address servers and static IP address servers. Almost every SLIP server will prompt you to login using a username and password when dialing in. dip can handle logging you in automatically.

== Static SLIP server with a dialup line and DIP. == 

A static SLIP server is one in which you have been supplied an IP address that is exclusively yours. Each time you connect to the server, you will configure your SLIP port with that address. The static SLIP server will answer your modem call, possibly prompt you for a username and password, and then route any datagrams destined for your address to you via that connection. If you have a static server, then you may want to put entries for your hostname and IP address (since you know what it will be) into your /etc/hosts. You should also configure some other files such as: rc.inet2, host.conf, resolv.conf, /etc/HOSTNAME and rc.local. Remember that when configuring rc.inet1, you don't need to add any special commands for your SLIP connection since it is dip that does all of the hard work for you in configuring your interface. You will need to give dip the appropriate information and it will configure the interface for you after commanding the modem to establish the call and logging you into your SLIP server.  
If this is how your SLIP server works then you can move to section `Using Dip' to learn how to configure dip appropriately.

== Dynamic SLIP server with a dialup line and DIP. ==

A dynamic SLIP server is one which allocates you an IP address randomly, from a pool of addresses, each time you logon. This means that there is no guarantee that you will have any particular address each time, and that address may well be used by someone else after you have logged off.  The network administrator who configured the SLIP server will have assigned a pool of address for the SLIP server to use, when the server receives a new incoming call, it finds the first unused address, guides the caller through the login process and then prints a welcome message that contains the IP address it has allocated and will proceed to use that IP address for the duration of that call.

Configuring for this type of server is similar to configuring for a static server, except that you must add a step where you obtain the IP address that the server has allocated for you and configure your SLIP device with that.

Again, dip does the hard work and new versions are smart enough to not only log you in, but to also be able to automatically read the IP address printed in the welcome message and store it so that you can have it configure your SLIP device with it.  If this is how your SLIP server works then you can move to section `Using Dip' to learn how to configure dip appropriately.

== Using DIP. ==

As explained earlier, dip is a powerful program that can simplify and automate the process of dialing into the SLIP server, logging you in, starting the connection and configuring your SLIP devices with the appropriate ifconfig and route commands.  
Essentially to use dip you'll write a `dip script', which is basically a list of commands that dip understands that tell dip how to perform each of the actions you want it to perform. See sample.dip that comes supplied with dip to get an idea of how it works. dip is quite a powerful program, with many options.  Instead of going into all of them here you should look at the man page, README and sample files that will have come with your version of dip.  

You may notice that the sample.dip script assumes that you're using a static SLIP server, so you know what your IP address is beforehand.  For dynamic SLIP servers, the newer versions of dip include a command you can use to automatically read and configure your SLIP device with the IP address that the dynamic server allocates for you. The following sample is a modified version of the sample.dip that came supplied with dip337j-uri.tgz and is probably a good starting point for you.  You might like to save it as /etc/dipscript and edit it to suit your configuration:

&lt;pre&gt;

     #       This file should work for Annex type dynamic servers, if you

     #

     main:
     # Next, set up the other side's name and address.
     # My dialin machine is called 'xs4all.hacktic.nl' (== 193.78.33.42)
     get $remote xs4all.hacktic.nl
     # Set netmask on sl0 to 255.255.255.0

     port cua02

     if $errlvl != 0 goto modem_trouble
     dial 555-1234567
     if $errlvl != 1 goto modem_trouble

     # We are connected.  Login to the system.
     login:
     sleep 2
     wait ogin: 20
     if $errlvl != 0 goto login_trouble
     send MYLOGIN\n
     wait ord: 20
     if $errlvl != 0 goto password_error
     send MYPASSWD\n
     loggedin:

     # We are now logged in.
     wait SOMEPROMPT 30
     if $errlvl != 0 goto prompt_error

     # Command the server into SLIP mode
     send SLIP\n
     wait SLIP 30
     if $errlvl != 0 goto prompt_error

     # Get and Set your IP address from the server.
     #   Here we assume that after commanding the SLIP server into SLIP
     #   mode that it prints your IP address
     get $locip remote 30
	if $errlvl != 0 goto prompt_error

	# Set up the SLIP operating parameters.
	get $mtu 296
	# Ensure &quot;route add -net default xs4all.hacktic.nl&quot; will be done
	default

	# Say hello and fire up!
	done:
	print CONNECTED $locip ---&gt; $rmtip
	mode CSLIP
	goto exit

	prompt_error:
	print TIME-OUT waiting for sliplogin to fire up...
	goto error

	login_trouble:
	print Trouble waiting for the Login: prompt...
	goto error

	password:error:
	print Trouble waiting for the Password: prompt...
	goto error

	modem_trouble:
	print Trouble occurred with the modem...
	error:
	print CONNECT FAILED to $remote
	quit

	exit:
	exit

&lt;/pre&gt;

The above example assumes you are calling a dynamic SLIP server, if you are calling a static SLIP server, then the sample.dip file that comes with dip337j-uri.tgz should work for you.

When dip is given the get $local command it searches the incoming text from the remote end for a string that looks like an IP address, ie strings numbers separated by `.' characters. This modification was put in place specifically for dynamic SLIP servers, so that the process of reading the IP address granted by the server could be automated.

The example above will automatically create a default route via your SLIP link, if this is not what you want, you might have an ethernet connection that should be your default route, then remove the default command from the script.  After this script has finished running, if you do an ifconfig command, you will see that you have a device sl0.
This is your SLIP device.  Should you need to, you can modify its configuration manually, after the dip command has finished, using the ifconfig and route commands.

Please note that dip allows you to select a number of different protocols to use with the mode command, the most common example is cSLIP for SLIP with compression. Please note that both ends of the link must agree, so you should ensure that whatever you select agrees with what your server is set to.

The above example is fairly robust and should cope with most errors.  Please refer to the dip man page for more information. Naturally you could, for example, code the script to do such things as redial the server if it doesn't get a connection within a prescribed period of time, or even try a series of servers if you have access to more than one.

== Permanent SLIP connection using a leased line and slattach. ==

If you have a cable between two machines, or are fortunate enough to have a leased line, or some other permanent serial connection between your machine and another, then you don't need to go to all the trouble of using dip to set up your serial link. slattach is a very simple to use utility that will allow you just enough functionality to configure your connection.

Since your connection will be a permanent one, you will want to add some commands to your rc.inet1 file. In essence all you need to do for a permanent connection is ensure that you configure the serial device to the correct speed and switch the serial device into SLIP mode.  slattach allows you to do this with one command. Add the following to your rc.inet1 file:

&lt;pre&gt;
             #
             # Attach a leased line static SLIP connection
             #
             #  configure /dev/cua0 for 19.2kbps and cslip
             /sbin/slattach -p cslip -s 19200 /dev/cua0 &amp;
             /sbin/ifconfig sl0 IPA.IPA.IPA.IPA pointopoint IPR.IPR.IPR.IPR up
             #
             # End static SLIP.

Where:


   IPA.IPA.IPA.IPA
      represents your IP address.


   IPR.IPR.IPR.IPR
      represents the IP address of the remote end.

&lt;/pre&gt;

slattach allocates the first unallocated SLIP device to the serial device specified. slattach starts with sl0. Therefore the first slattach command attaches SLIP device sl0 to the serial device specified and sl1 the next time, etc.  slattach allows you to configure a number of different protocols with the -p argument. In your case you will use either SLIP or cSLIP depending on whether you want to use compression or not.  Note: both ends must agree on whether you want compression or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SLIP server. ==

If you have a machine that is perhaps network connected, that you'd like other people be able to dial into and provide network services, then you will need to configure your machine as a server. If you want to use SLIP as the serial line protocol, then currently you have three options as to how to configure your Linux machine as a SLIP server. My preference would be to use the first presented, sliplogin, as it seems the easiest to configure and understand, but I will present a summary of each, so you can make your own decision.

== Slip Server using sliplogin . ==

sliplogin is a program that you can use in place of the normal login shell for SLIP users that converts the terminal line into a SLIP line.  It allows you to configure your Linux machine as either a static address server, users get the same address everytime they call in, or a dynamic address server, where users get an address allocated for them which will not necessarily be the same as the last time they called.

The caller will login as per the standard login process, entering their username and password, but instead of being presented with a shell after their login, sliplogin is executed which searches its configuration file (/etc/slip.hosts) for an entry with a login name that matches that of the caller. If it locates one, it configures the line as an 8bit clean line, and uses an ioctl call to convert the line discipline to SLIP. When this process is complete, the last stage of configuration takes place, where sliplogin invokes a shell script which configures the SLIP interface with the relevant ip address, netmask and sets appropriate routing in place.  This script is usually called /etc/slip.login, but in a similar manner to getty, if you have certain callers that require special initialization, then you can create configuration scripts called /etc/slip.login.loginname that will be run instead of the default specifically for them.

There are either three or four files that you need to configure to get sliplogin working for you. I will detail how and where to get the software and how each is configured in detail. The files are: 

&lt;pre&gt;
·  /etc/passwd, for the dialin user accounts.

·  /etc/slip.hosts, to contain the information unique to each dial-in
   user.

·  /etc/slip.login, which manages the configuration of the routing
   that needs to be performed for the user.

·  /etc/slip.tty, which is required only if you are configuring your
   server for dynamic address allocation and contains a table of
   addresses to allocate

·  /etc/slip.logout, which contains commands to clean up after the
   user has hung up or logged out.
&lt;/pre&gt;


== Where to get sliplogin ==

You may already have the sliplogin package installed as part of your distribution, if not then sliplogin can be obtained from: metalab.unc.edu.  The tar file contains both source, precompiled binaries and a man page.

To ensure that only authorized users will be able to run sliplogin program, you should add an entry to your /etc/group file similar to the following:

     slip::13:radio,fred


When you install the sliplogin package, the Makefile will change the group ownership of the sliplogin program to slip, and this will mean that only users who belong to that group will be able to execute it.  The example above will allow only users radio and fred to execute sliplogin.

To install the binaries into your /sbin directory and the man page into section 8, do the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
     # cd /usr/src
     # gzip -dc .../sliplogin-2.1.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     # cd sliplogin-2.1.1
     # &lt;..edit the Makefile if you don't use shadow passwords..&gt;
     # make install
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to recompile the binaries before installation, add a make clean before the make install. If you want to install the binaries somewhere else, you will need to edit the Makefile install rule.  

Please read the README files that come with the package for more information.

== Configuring /etc/passwd  for Slip hosts. ==

Normally you would create some special logins for Slip callers in your /etc/passwd file. A convention commonly followed is to use the hostname of the calling host with a capital `S' prefixing it. So, for example, if the calling host is called radio then you could create a /etc/passwd entry that looked like:

     Sradio:FvKurok73:1427:1:radio SLIP login:/tmp:/sbin/sliplogin

It doesn't really matter what the account is called, so long as it is meaningful to you.

Note: the caller doesn't need any special home directory, as they will not be presented with a shell from this machine, so /tmp is a good choice.  Also note that sliplogin is used in place of the normal login shell.

== Configuring /etc/slip.hosts == 

The /etc/slip.hosts file is the file that sliplogin searches for entries matching the login name to obtain configuration details for this caller. It is this file where you specify the ip address and netmask that will be assigned to the caller and configured for their use. Sample entries for two hosts, one a static configuration for host radio and another, a dynamic configuration for user host albert might look like:

&lt;pre&gt;
#
Sradio   44.136.8.99   44.136.8.100  255.255.255.0  normal      -1
Salbert  44.136.8.99   DYNAMIC       255.255.255.0  compressed  60
#
&lt;/pre&gt;


The /etc/slip.hosts file entries are:


1. the login name of the caller.

2. ip address of the server machine, ie this machine.

3. ip address that the caller will be assigned. If this field is coded
   DYNAMIC then an ip address will be allocated based on the
   information contained in your /etc/slip.tty file discussed later.
   Note: you must be using at least version 1.3 of sliplogin for this
   to work.

4. the netmask assigned to the calling machine in dotted decimal
   notation eg 255.255.255.0 for a Class C network mask.

5. the slip mode setting which allows you to enable/disable
   compression and slip other features. Allowable values here are
   &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;compressed&quot;.

6. a timeout parameter which specifies how long the line can remain
   idle (no datagrams received) before the line is automatically
   disconnected. A negative value disables this feature.

7. optional arguments.


Note: You can use either hostnames or IP addresses in dotted decimal notation for fields 2 and 3. If you use hostnames then those hosts must be resolvable, that is, your machine must be able to locate an ip address for those hostnames, otherwise the script will fail when it is called. You can test this by trying trying to telnet to the hostname, if you get the `Trying nnn.nnn.nnn...' message then your machine has been able to find an ip address for that name. If you get the message `Unknown host', then it has not. If not, either use ip addresses in dotted decimal notation, or fix up your name resolver configuration (See section Name Resolution).

The most common slip modes are:


   normal
      to enable normal uncompressed SLIP.


   compressed
      to enable van Jacobsen header compression (cSLIP)


Naturally these are mutually exclusive, you can use one or the other.  For more information on the other options available, refer to the man pages.

== Configuring the /etc/slip.login  file.==

After sliplogin has searched the /etc/slip.hosts and found a matching entry, it will attempt to execute the /etc/slip.login file to actually configure the SLIP interface with its ip address and netmask. 
 
The sample /etc/slip.login file supplied with the sliplogin package looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
     #!/bin/sh -
     #
     #       @(#)slip.login  5.1 (Berkeley) 7/1/90
     #
     # generic login file for a SLIP line.  sliplogin invokes this with
     # the parameters:
     #     $1       $2       $3    $4, $5, $6 ...
     #   SLIPunit ttyspeed   pid   the arguments from the slip.host entry
     #
     /sbin/ifconfig $1 $5 pointopoint $6 mtu 1500 -trailers up
     /sbin/route add $6
     arp -s $6 &lt;hw_addr&gt; pub
     exit 0
     #
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will note that this script simply uses the ifconfig and route com­ mands to configure the SLIP device with its ipaddress, remote ip address and netmask and creates a route for the remote address via the SLIP device. Just the same as you would if you were using the slattach command.

Note also the use of Proxy ARP to ensure that other hosts on the same ethernet as the server machine will know how to reach the dial-in host.  The &lt;hw_addr&gt; field should be the hardware address of the ethernet card in the machine. If your server machine isn't on an ethernet network then you can leave this line out completely.  

== Configuring the /etc/slip.logout  file. ==

When the call drops out, you want to ensure that the serial device is restored to its normal state so that future callers will be able to login correctly.  This is achieved with the use of the /etc/slip.logout file. It is quite simple in format and is called with the same argument as the /etc/slip.login file.


&lt;pre&gt;
             #!/bin/sh -
             #
             #               slip.logout
             #
             /sbin/ifconfig $1 down
             arp -d $6
             exit 0
             #
&lt;/pre&gt;


All it does is `down' the interface which will delete the manual route previously created. It also uses the arp command to delete any proxy arp put in place, again, you don't need the arp command in the script if your server machine does not have an ethernet port.

== Configuring the /etc/slip.tty  file. ==

If you are using dynamic ip address allocation (have any hosts configured with the DYNAMIC keyword in the /etc/slip.hosts file, then you must configure the /etc/slip.tty file to list what addresses are assigned to what port. You only need this file if you wish your server to dynamically allocate addresses to users.

The file is a table that lists the tty devices that will support dial- in SLIP connections and the ip address that should be assigned to users who call in on that port.  

Its format is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;

     # slip.tty    tty -&gt; IP address mappings for dynamic SLIP
     # format: /dev/tty?? xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
     #
     /dev/ttyS0      192.168.0.100
     /dev/ttyS1      192.168.0.101
     #
&lt;/pre&gt;


What this table says is that callers that dial in on port /dev/ttyS0 who have their remote address field in the /etc/slip.hosts file set to DYNAMIC will be assigned an address of 192.168.0.100. 
 
In this way you need only allocate one address per port for all users who do not require an dedicated address for themselves. This helps you keep the number of addresses you need down to a minimum to avoid wastage.

== Slip Server using dip . ==

Let me start by saying that some of the information below came from the dip man pages, where how to run Linux as a SLIP server is briefly documented. Please also beware that the following has been based on the dip337o-uri.tgz package and probably will not apply to other versions of dip.

dip has an input mode of operation, where it automatically locates an entry for the user who invoked it and configures the serial line as a SLIP link according to information it finds in the /etc/diphosts file.
This input mode of operation is activated by invoking dip as diplogin.  This therefore is how you use dip as a SLIP server, by creating special accounts where diplogin is used as the login shell.

The first thing you will need to do is to make a symbolic link as follows:

     # ln -sf /usr/sbin/dip /usr/sbin/diplogin

You then need to add entries to both your /etc/passwd and your /etc/diphosts files. The entries you need to make are formatted as follows:

To configure Linux as a SLIP server with dip, you need to create some special SLIP accounts for users, where dip (in input mode) is used as the login shell. A suggested convention is that of having all SLIP accounts begin with a capital `S', eg `Sfredm'.

A sample /etc/passwd entry for a SLIP user looks like:

&lt;pre&gt;
     Sfredm:ij/SMxiTlGVCo:1004:10:Fred:/tmp:/usr/sbin/diplogin
     ^^         ^^        ^^  ^^   ^^   ^^   ^^
     |          |         |   |    |    |    \__ diplogin as login shell
     |          |         |   |    |    \_______ Home directory
     |          |         |   |    \____________ User Full Name
     |          |         |   \_________________ User Group ID
     |          |         \_____________________ User ID
     |          \_______________________________ Encrypted User Password
     \__________________________________________ Slip User Login Name

&lt;/pre&gt;


After the user logs in, the login program, if it finds and verifies the user ok, will execute the diplogin command. dip, when invoked as diplogin knows that it should automatically assume that it is being used a login shell. When it is started as diplogin the first thing it does is use the getuid() function call to get the userid of whoever has invoked it. It then searches the /etc/diphosts file for the first entry that matches either the userid or the name of the tty device that the call has come in on and configures itself appropriately.  By judicious decision as to whether to give a user an entry in the diphosts file, or whether to let the user be given the default configuration you can build your server in such a way that you can have a mix of static and dynamically assigned address users.  

dip will automatically add a `Proxy-ARP' entry if invoked in input mode, so you do not need to worry about manually adding such entries.  

== Configuring /etc/diphosts ==

/etc/diphosts is used by dip to lookup preset configurations for remote hosts. These remote hosts might be users dialing into your linux machine, or they might be for machines that you dial into with your linux machine.

The general format for /etc/diphosts is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
      ..
     Suwalt::145.71.34.1:145.71.34.2:255.255.255.0:SLIP uwalt:CSLIP,1006
     ttyS1::145.71.34.3:145.71.34.2:255.255.255.0:Dynamic ttyS1:CSLIP,296
      ..
&lt;/pre&gt;

The fields are:

1. login name: as returned by getpwuid(getuid()) or tty name.

2. unused: compat. with passwd

3. Remote Address: IP address of the calling host, either numeric or
   by name
4. Local Address: IP address of this machine, again numeric or by name

5. Netmask: in dotted decimal notation

6. Comment field: put whatever you want here.

7. protocol: Slip, CSlip etc.

8. MTU: decimal number

   An example /etc/net/diphosts entry for a remote SLIP user might be:

     Sfredm::145.71.34.1:145.71.34.2:255.255.255.0:SLIP uwalt:SLIP,296

which specifies a SLIP link with remote address of 145.71.34.1 and MTU
of 296, or:

     Sfredm::145.71.34.1:145.71.34.2:255.255.255.0:SLIP uwalt:CSLIP,1006

which specifies a cSLIP-capable link with remote address 145.71.34.1 and MTU of 1006.

Therefore, all users who you wish to be allowed a statically allocated dial-up IP access should have an entry in the /etc/diphosts. If you want users who call a particular port to have their details dynamically allocated then you must have an entry for the tty device and do not configure a user based entry. You should remember to configure at least one entry for each tty device that your dialup users use to ensure that a suitable configuration is available for them regardless of which modem they call in on.

When a user logs in they will receive a normal login and password prompt at which they should enter their SLIP-login userid and password. If these verify ok then the user will see no special messages and they should just change into SLIP mode at their end. The user should then be able to connect ok and be configured with the relevant parameters from the diphosts file.  

== SLIP server using the dSLIP  package.==

Matt Dillon &lt;dillon@apollo.west.oic.com&gt; has written a package that does not only dial-in but also dial-out SLIP. Matt's package is a combination of small programs and scripts that manage your connections for you. You will need to have tcsh installed as at least one of the scripts requires it. Matt supplies a binary copy of the expect utility as it too is needed by one of the scripts. You will most likely need some experience with expect to get this package working to your liking, but don't let that put you off.  
Matt has written a good set of installation instructions in the README file, so I won't bother repeating them.

You can get the dSLIP package from its home site at: apollo.west.oic.com /pub/linux/dillon_src/dSLIP203.tgz or from: 
metalab.unc.edu /pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/dSLIP203.tgz

Read the README file and create the /etc/passwd and /etc/group entries
before doing a make install.
