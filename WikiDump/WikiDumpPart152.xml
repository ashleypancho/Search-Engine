      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Advantages of After Hours Clinics ==

Medical practices have a huge role to play in treating their patients, even when the practice closes for the day. Injuries and illnesses can happen any time, and people may require a Perth after hours doctor. Patients cannot wait for days, let alone months, just to get a checkup; what they need is to go to a GP after hours clinic.

Sometimes there are instances when private practice can offer better and faster health care services as compared to the overcrowded hospital ER, which are commonly known to charge higher rates. The same medical treatment is given to people who are ill during those late hours. Being able to give them that same care means that patients are important to every after hours GP Perth/Northbridge doctor, and that says a lot! 

While they trust professionals to help them get better, some patients trust their own physicians more. In fact, a survey of patients have found that patient satisfaction with [http://northbridgemedical.com.au/ after hours GP] care was higher for the people who sought help from their family physician than those who went to a walk-in clinic, ER, or made use of a telephone consultation service. 

Looking for GP after hours clinic may be a bit challenging since a lot of them close by late afternoon. Also, not many after hours GP are available in various locations, and that is why people resort to going to emergency departments when seeking urgent care in the late hours. Luckily, there are some prominent after hours GP clinics in Western Australia. 

After hours GP Perth/Northbridge normally are open until five in the afternoon or seven in the evening. Others, such as Northbridge Medical Center, offer after hours GP health care services to patients from five thirty in the afternoon ‘til nine in the evening, from Mondays to Fridays. On weekends, they open from eight in the morning until nine in the evening. If that is not convenient enough for patients, this Northbridge after hours GP has reduced waiting hours and timely appointments. 

Northbridge after hours GP proffers the same services as those normal hours medical centers. Practitioners prescribe patients with medications, give injections, do stitching and splinting, as well as advise receiving IV fluids. They even do strep tests, blood tests, x-rays, and urine tests at the center. 

Finally, what is great about after hours GP Perth/Northbridge clinics like Northbridge Medical is that they treat young, adult, and old patients. Practitioners are trained and highly experienced in treating different kinds of sick people and in fields of urgent and emergency care. Clearly, it is the safest and most suitable facility to depend on when suffering from an illness or injury in the late hours.

== Some Options to Go For When Seeking Medical Help in the Late Hours ==

Basically, doctors work almost twenty four hours a day, but sometimes it seems that you find it hard to contact ones that work after hours. You will need a bit of luck to look for a general practitioner at six in the evening or later than that. If ever you do find a GP that late, the waiting hours are usually longer and the fees are higher. When you seek immediate medical attention, you have to call an ambulance and head to the emergency department. Yet, when your medical problem is less complicated than the latter, contacting a doctor during late hours may be a little tricky. 

At this point, not only are you distressed with the fact that you have recently been injured or dealing with a condition, but you also become stressed out that no doctor may be available to help you relieve you of your condition. So, how do you get hold of a doctor when you are suffering at such an inappropriate or inconvenient time? Read on to find out.

One option is to seek medical assistance from a family member or a good friend who is a doctor. However, it is not all the time that they will be there to help you, as they too have other priorities to attend to, particularly during the wee hours of the night. So, only contact them when you really need to. 

All general practitioners have an obligation to provide medical care after hours. There are instances when they are on-call and cannot be in two places at the same time. This then calls for making use of a locum service, a kind of medical assistance that is led by a locum doctor who plays the role of the main doctor in the event of his absence. 

Locum services offerprimary care that allow house calls, even after hours. Like majority of afterhours assistances, it is also a mixed billing service and has waiting hours. The difference between the two is that you only have to wait in your own home for the locum doctor to drop by and check on you. This, in particular, is valuable if you are feeling awfully under the weather, or if you are stuck at home taking care of your kids. 

Locum assistances will phone your regular doctor in order for them to be aware what your condition is. Even if you are not sure about the gravity of your illness, you can always rely on a locum doctor to aid you in such times. If your state becomes worse, it is best to not wait for the locum doctor and just call an ambulance as quickly as possible.

If you are unable to get in touch with any of the mentioned professionals, you may have to go to a GPafter hours clinic.

A GPafter hours clinic, such as Northbridge Medical Centre in Australia, is open until the late hours. While normally, GP clinics are open from 9:00am to 5:00pm, Northbridge Medical Centre is also open from 5:30pm to 9:00pm, Mondays to Fridays, and 8:00am to 9:00pm, Saturdays and Sundays. Clearly, this medical institution has better service hours than other after hours GP Perth/Northbridge. 

Northbridge [http://northbridgemedical.com.au/ after hours GP] like Northbridge Medical Centre are a great solution to any primary care medical concerns such as colds, flu, sprains, grazes and cuts, and various illnesses common in children. The system as to how clinics entertain and treat patients varies, but the most common thing that happens is you, the patient, attend and wait until your name is called. The wait will be a little longer than a regular doctor’s appointment, but not longer than waiting at the hospital emergency department. 

In essence, there are important cases when you will need a Northbridge or Perth after hours doctor, and you can be sure that they deliver the same fast and successful services as any regular doctor working during the day.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Traditional Categories==
Statements that fall within the traditional categories of hearsay are presumptively admissible. They can nevertheless be challenged under the principles of necessity and reliability.
&lt;ref&gt;
R v Starr [2000] [http://canlii.ca/t/525l 2 SCR 144] &lt;br&gt;
R v Mapara 2005 SCC 23 [http://canlii.ca/t/1k7h2]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional categories of exceptions consist of the following:
# Where the statement is an '''admission by an accused person'''
# When the statement is made '''against the declarator's interest'''
# When it is made in the course of the '''declarator's duty'''
# When the statement is part of a public or '''governmental document'''
# '''Dying declaration'''
# Statements made when the declarator was in a state of shock or surprise ('''Res Gestae''')
# Statements describing the '''declarator's physical or psychological condition'''
# '''Sworn testimony''' from a previous hearing
# '''Past recollection recorded'''
# Statement conveys '''&quot;state of mind&quot;'''
# Statement conveys '''&quot;present intentions&quot;'''
# '''Statutory exceptions'''
# Statement is part of the '''narrative''' of the evidence

==Admissions of the Accused==
Generally, admission include “any statement made by a declarant and tendered as evidence at trial by the opposing party.”&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Violette, [2008]  B.C.J. No. 2781(S.C.) at 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Any admission by an accused is admissible as provided that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Terry, [1996] S.C.J. No. 62 at 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Admission made by the accused as well as statements adopted by the accused in an intercepted communication is admissible as a hearsay exception.&lt;ref&gt;R v Violette  [2008]  B.C.J. No. 2781(S.C.) at 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement made against the declarator's interest==

==Adoptive Admissions==

A categorical exception to the hearsay rule is where the accused adopts a hearsay statement by words, conduct, action or demeanor.&lt;ref&gt;R v Stein, [1928] SCR 553 at 558 (“It is only when the accused by &quot;word or conduct, action or demeanour&quot; has accepted what they contain, and to the extent that he does so, that statements made by other persons in his presence have any evidentiary value …”)&lt;/ref&gt;

The exception involves two elements:&lt;ref&gt;R v Dimetro (1945), 85 CCC 135 at para 4 (Ont CA)&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether there is “evidence from which the Court could reasonably infer that the accused by their behaviour acknowledged their guilt?” &lt;ref&gt; See also R v Warner 1994 CanLII 842 (ON CA), (1994), 21 O.R. (3d) 136 at 144-145(Ont CA)&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether such an inference should be drawn? 

The inference should only be drawn where it is a sufficient “foundation” to so as to reasonably infer that the accused intended to accept “the statement as to make it in whole or in part his own”
&lt;ref&gt;R v Harrison, [1946] 3 DLR 690, 62 BCR 420 at 430 (BCCA)&lt;/reF&gt; 

A speculative interference based on ambiguous conduct is not sufficient to fit the exception. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Briscoe, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqfhw 2012 ABQB 158], a nod in response to an utterance of “I helped with [a murder]”&lt;/ref&gt;

A foundation requires at a minimum that:&lt;ref&gt;R v Tanasichuk, 2007 NBCA 76 at para 110&lt;/ref&gt;:
#  the statement must have been made in the accused’s presence, in circumstances such that the accused would be expected to respond;
#  the accused’s failure to respond could reasonably lead to the inference that, by his silence, the accused adopted the statement; and
# the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.

Mere presence of the accused at the time of the statement is not sufficient to prove an adoption of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;R v Dubois, (1986), 27 CCC (3d) 325 at 341-342 (Ont CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

Instructions to the jury on the issue of whether the accused agreed to the statement should include informing the jury the following:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tanasichuk, [http://canlii.ca/t/1tg0f 2007 NBCA 76] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the accused, by his conduct, adopted the statements made in his presence and only to the extent that they were adopted should the jury accept them as true;
# consider all of the circumstances under which the statement was made
# “if in their view the accused did not assent [...] to the correctness of the statements made in his presence, these statements would have no evidentiary value [...] and should be entirely disregarded”

==Past Recollection Recorded==
Where a witness has testified that he cannot recall core details of a statements made but that she told the truth whenever speaking to them.  The Court may admit the notes or document if it is satisfied that they meet the Wigmore criteria:
&lt;ref&gt;
adopted in R. v. Fliss 2002 SCC 16 at 244 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc16/2002scc16.html#par63]&lt;br&gt;
see also: R. v. Pilarinos, [2002] B.C.J. No. 1153 (BCSC) at paras. 7 – 12 [http://canlii.ca/t/5kdt#par7] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Meddoui, 1990 CanLII 2592 (AB CA)[http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/1990/1990canlii2592/1990canlii2592.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Wilks, 2005 MBCA 99 [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2005/2005mbca99/2005mbca99.html]&lt;br&gt;
c.f. [[Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Testimonial_evidence#Present_Memory_Revived|present memory revived]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
:
#the past recollection must have been recorded in some reliable way;
#at the time, it must have been sufficiently fresh and vivid to be probably accurate;
#the witness must be able now to assert that the record accurately represented his knowledge and recollection at the time.  The usual phrase requires the witness to affirm that he “knew it to be true at the time”; and
#the original record itself must be used, if it is procurable.

In practice counsel should establish:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McCarroll, [http://canlii.ca/t/217d7 2008 ONCA 715] - sets out four key critera(CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;
:1) that the witnesses memory is exhausted and cannot answer the question;
:2) that a record was made by the witness or on behalf of the witness;
:3) the record was made near the time that the information was learned;
:4) the information was fresh in their mind at the time;
:5) the information was recorded from what they knew at the time and was done as accurately as possible.

Counsel can then asks the record to be put in as an exhibit.

An example would be where asking a witness to recall a licence plate number that they observed and wrote down in a statement. This statement or note would have been made at a time when the information was fresh in their mind and they made an effort to be accurate. 

The witness will be asked about whether they recall the licence plate number. Often they will not recall the number by heart, this will prompt a request to introduce past recollection recorded. Counsel should go through questions establishing the lack of memory; the existance of the record; the circumstances of its creation; and the accuracy of its contents.

==State of mind==

A statement of a declarant can be adduced into evidence as a hearsay exception where it explicitly declares the state of mind of the declarant. 
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Candir, 2009 ONCA 915, at para. 56 [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2009/2009onca915/2009onca915.html#para56]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. P.(R.), (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 334 (Ont. H.C.J.) para. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
Where the declaration can infer the state of mind, it is also admissible but not as a hearsay exception, but rather as circumstantial evidence inferring the state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

== Spontaneous utterances / res gestae == 
Spontaneous or excited utterances are a class of exception to the hearsay rule. An utterance falls in this category where the evidence can characterize it as being a spontaneous exclamation made without premeditation or artifice and before the speaker had time to concoct something.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Schwartz (1978) NSR (2d) 335 at para. 15&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Magloir 2003 NSCA 74&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Slugoski, [1985] BCJ 1835&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Khan, (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 197 at p. 207, aff'd on other grounds 1990 CanLII 77 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been characterized as words that are contemporanous with some action. Statements are admitted at times as &quot;words brigaded to action&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ly (1996), 193 A.R. 149; [1996] A.J. No. 1089 (C.A.) at para. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Requirements to the exception usually include:&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Hamilton, 2011 NSSC 305 at para. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
# utterance made soon after underlying offence
# speaker was in state of upset or trauma
# enough probative value to outweigh any prejudice

The utterance does not need to be strictly contemporaneous &quot;so long as the stress or pressure created by it is ongoing&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;See R. v. Khan, (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 197 at p. 207, aff'd on other grounds 1990 CanLII 77 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Co-Conspirators==
The co-conspirators' exception to hearsay permits the admission of out-of-court statements made by a co-conspirator.

The Crown must prove:
# that there was a conspiracy
# that the accused was a member of the conspiracy
# the utterance was in furtherance of the conspiracy.
&lt;ref&gt;See R. v. Carter, [http://canlii.ca/t/1z1c7 1982 CanLII 35] (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938
R. v. Mapara, [http://canlii.ca/t/1k7h2 2005 SCC 23] (CanLII), [2005] 1 SCR 358 at para. 8 (“Statements made by a person engaged in an unlawful conspiracy are receivable as admissions as against all those acting in concert if the declarations were made while the conspiracy was ongoing and were made towards the accomplishment of the common object” &lt;/ref&gt;

This exception is not limited or obsolete despite the overlap with the principled approach.&lt;ref&gt;
Mapara
&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of the co-conspirator is not determinative of whether the exception applies.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. N.Y., [http://canlii.ca/t/ftlsv 2012 ONCA 745] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dying declaration==

==Declarator's Physical or Psychological Condition==

==Sworn testimony from Previous Hearing==

==Present and Future Intentions==
Similar to state of mind exception, it is permissible to admit statements of a witnesses' future intentions.&lt;ref&gt; Chang 2003 173 CCC 3d 397&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==In Course of the Declarator's Duty==

==Public or Governmental Document==

See [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary_evidence#Admissibility_of_Specific_Types_of_Documents]]

==Business Records==
A record is admissible as hearsay where it is a business record. A business record is a record that is required to kept accurate as part of the normal course of business. The document can be admitted under the Canada Evidence Act or common law.

See [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary_evidence#Business_Records]] -- R v Wilcox [http://canlii.ca/t/4v77 2001 NSCA 45]

==Documents in Possession==
Documents that are found to be in actual or constructive possession of the accused may be admitted as hearsay. The documents can be used to show knowledge, participation, or state of mind. &lt;ref&gt;See R v Wood [http://canlii.ca/t/4v70#par30 2001 NSCA 38 at 30]&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents in possession are admissible for the truth of its contents where the accused has shown “recognition, adoption or acting upon the documents“&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McCullough, 2001 SKQB 449&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
==Narrative==
Strictly speaking, narrative is not a traditional hearsay exception, and is not fully hearsay at all since it is not being proffered for the truth of its contents.

It is admissible on the basis that it provides context and greater understanding to the trier of fact of the details of the investigation. It is often useful in sexual assault cases in order to determine credibility.
 
See R v Assoun, [http://canlii.ca/t/1n38p 2006 NSCA 47]

In the context of recorded phone calls, the “nature of the business” of the calls is not hearsay.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Williams, [2009] B.C.J. No. 1518&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
==Preliminary Inquiry / Trial evidence ==
Under s. 715 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec715], evidence from either a previous trial or preliminary inquiry may be admitted into evidence where the witness refuses to testify, is dead, is physically or mentally ill, or is out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;See also R. v. Potvin, [1989] 1 SCR 525&lt;/ref&gt;

It must be proven that the evidence was taken in front of the accused. If so, it is admissible unless the accused didn't have full opportunity to cross examine.&lt;Ref&gt;see s. 715&lt;/ref&gt; There is an exception to this rule under s.715(2.1), where the accused was excused under s. 537(1)(j.1)

See R v Alcantara, 2012 ABQB 219&lt;ref&gt;prelim evidence was admitted&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
==Video Statement of Under 18 Year Old==
Witnesses under the age of 18 who give video-taped statements shortly after the alleged incident may have their statements put in for the truth of their contents under s. 715.1 where the witness is able to adopt the statement in court. Once a video statement is admitted under s.715.1, the absence of the ability to cross-examine the witness only goes to the weight of the evidence and cannot be used to argue its admissibility.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. R.G.B., 2012 MBCA 5 at 42&lt;/reF&gt;

Section 715.1 states:
{{Quotation|
'''Evidence of victim or witness under 18'''&lt;br&gt;
715.1 (1) In any proceeding against an accused in which a victim or other witness was under the age of eighteen years at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, a video recording made within a reasonable time after the alleged offence, in which the victim or witness describes the acts complained of, is admissible in evidence if the victim or witness, while testifying, adopts the contents of the video recording, unless the presiding judge or justice is of the opinion that admission of the video recording in evidence would interfere with the proper administration of justice.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Order prohibiting use'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The presiding judge or justice may prohibit any other use of a video recording referred to in subsection (1).
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. 19 (3rd Supp.), s. 16; 1997, c. 16, s. 7; 2005, c. 32, s. 23.

#The form of questions used by any other person appearing in the videotaped statement;
#any interest of anyone participating in the making of the statement;
#the quality of the video and audio reproduction;
#the presence or absence of inadmissible evidence in the statement;
#the ability to eliminate inappropriate material by editing the tape;
#whether other out‑of‑court statements by the complainant have been entered;
#whether any visual information in the statement might tend to prejudice the accused (for example, unrelated injuries visible on the victim);
#whether the prosecution has been allowed to use any other method to facilitate the giving of evidence by the complainant;
#whether the trial is one by judge alone or by a jury; and
#the amount of time which has passed since the making of the tape and the present ability of the witness to effectively relate to the events described.

==Voluminous Document Exception==
An exception to hearsay is the &quot;voluminous document exception&quot; first outlined by Wigmore.

According to Wigmore, the exception applies where:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Agyei, [2007] O.J. No. 3914 at para 26&lt;/ref&gt;
#there are a very large number of detailed business records that would be impractical to present to the court;
#a competent witness has examined the documents and summarized them; and 
# the documents have been made available to the other side.

Where the criteria are met, the summary can be admitted without putting in the original records as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lee, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fk72 2011 NSPC 5] (CanLII) at 20
&lt;/ref&gt;
The exception is not applicable where the work product &quot;involve[s] interpretations that may be the subject of legitimate debate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Lee at 19-20&lt;br&gt;
R. v. George, [1993] A.J. No. 798 (Alta. P.C.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Principles==
The principled approach is founded on the premise that if a statement is '''necessary''' to a hearing&lt;ref&gt;R v Khan, at para. 29&lt;/ref&gt;, and it is '''reliable'''&lt;ref&gt;R v Khan, at para 30&lt;/ref&gt;, it should be admitted even if it is hearsay.

When considering a prior inconsistent statment the court must begin by presuming that the statment is inadmissible for the truth of its contents unless it has been established there is sufficient indicia of trustworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Blackman, [http://canlii.ca/t/1z1bv 2008 SCC 37]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before hearsay evidence can be admissible under the principled exception it must be relevant&lt;Ref&gt;R v Underwood 2002 ABCA 310 at para 19&lt;/ref&gt; and has been determined whether it already fits in a traditional exception.&lt;ref&gt;R v Starr, 2000 SCC 40 at para. 212-214&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the hearsay evidence is reliable and necessary, there is still a discretionary ability to exclude the evidence where the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Smith at para 45&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Procedure==
R. v. Woodard, [http://canlii.ca/t/23cvr 2009 MBCA 42] summarized procedure for the admission of evidence under the principled approach to hearsay as follows at 46: 
{{quotation| 
(1)        The first matter to determine before embarking on a hearsay admissibility inquiry is whether the proposed evidence is hearsay. An out-of-court statement will be hearsay when: (1) it is adduced to prove the truth of its contents (the purpose); and (2) there is limited or no opportunity for a contemporaneous cross-examination of the declarant (the concern) (see Khelawon, at paras. 56-58).&lt;P&gt;
 
(2)        Once the proposed evidence is identified as hearsay, it is presumptively inadmissible, unless it falls under a traditional common law exception to the hearsay rule or is admitted under the principled approach to the hearsay rule (see Khelawon, at paras. 56, 59, and Couture, at para. 78).
 &lt;P&gt;
(3)        Whether the hearsay meets the necessity and threshold reliability criteria under the principled approach will be determined on a voir dire. The onus is on the person who seeks to adduce the evidence to establish these criteria on a balance of probabilities (see Khelawon, at para. 47).
 &lt;P&gt;
(4)        If the proponent of the evidence cannot meet the twin criteria of necessity and reliability, the general exclusionary rule prevails. The trial judge's function (as gatekeeper) is to guard against the admission of hearsay evidence which is unnecessary in the context of the issue to be decided, or the reliability of which is neither readily apparent from the trustworthiness of its contents, nor capable of being meaningfully tested by the ultimate trier of fact (see Khelawon, at paras. 2-3).
 &lt;P&gt;
(5)        The criterion of necessity is founded on society's interest in getting at the truth and is intended to ensure that the evidence presented to the court be in the best available form, usually by calling the maker of the statement as a witness. If that is not possible, it may be that if the evidence is to be adduced at all, it can only be presented in its hearsay form (see Khelawon, at para. 49, and Couture, at para. 79).
 &lt;P&gt;
(6)        The criterion of threshold reliability is about ensuring the integrity of the trial process and is usually met: (1) by showing that sufficient trust can be put in the truth and accuracy of the statements because of the way in which they came about; or (2) by showing that, in the circumstances, the ultimate trier of fact will be in a position to sufficiently assess their worth. The two ways of demonstrating threshold reliability are not mutually exclusive. In cases where the declarant is available to be cross-examined, the focus will necessarily be on the latter way (see Khelawon, at paras. 49, 61-63, Couture, at para. 80, Devine, at para. 23, and Blackman, at para. 35).
 &lt;P&gt;
(7)        A distinction must be made between &quot;ultimate reliability&quot; and &quot;threshold reliability.&quot; Only the latter is inquired into on the admissibility voir dire. The failure to respect this distinction would not only result in the undue prolongation of admissibility hearings, it would distort the fact-finding process. Whether the evidence is relied upon to decide the issues in the case is a matter reserved for the ultimate trier of fact to decide in the context of the entirety of the evidence (see Khelawon, at paras. 3, 50).
 &lt;P&gt;
(8)        Relevant factors to be considered cannot invariably be categorized as relating either to threshold or ultimate reliability. Rather, the relevance of any particular factor will depend on the particular dangers arising from the hearsay nature of the statement and the available means, if any, of overcoming them (see Khelawon, at para. 55).
 &lt;P&gt;
(9)        Although there are no hard and fast rules about the manner of conducting the hearsay admissibility inquiry, there are good reasons to look first at whether there are adequate substitutes that give the trier of fact a sufficient basis to assess the statement's truth and accuracy. Whenever the threshold reliability requirement is met on this basis, there is no need to inquire further into the likely truth of the statement (see Couture, at paras. 87-88).
 &lt;P&gt;
(10)      Even if the two criteria are met, the trial judge has the discretion to exclude hearsay evidence where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect (see Khelawon, at para. 49).

}}

A KGB application is typically one made by the Crown, but may also be made by the defence. The defence is permitted to apply to put a previous inconsistent statement into evidence for the truth of its contents.&lt;REf&gt;
See R. v. Brisco, [2007] A.J. No. 208 and R. v. Eisenhauer, [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a KGB application can be undertaken the court must first be satisfied on a threshold that the prior inconsistent statement is the sole evidence of the witness&lt;ReF&gt;R v KGB at para. 74&lt;/ref&gt; and that the statement is consistent with the evidence in court.


{{reflist|2}}

==Necessary==
Necessity must be in relation to a particular goal. The court should consider whether that goal can be achieved by other evidence that would otherwise be more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;see eg. R. v. Abel, [http://canlii.ca/t/fq2cl 2011 NLTD 173] at 117&lt;/ref&gt; If the exists other avenues of proving the fact sought then the exception will not apply.

In the context of a recanting witness, necessity concerns the unavailability of the statment and not the witness.&lt;Ref&gt;See R. v. Devine, [http://canlii.ca/t/1xdt6 2008 SCC 36] at para 16&lt;br&gt;
R. v. U.(F.J.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1frhp 1995 CanLII 74] (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764&lt;br&gt; 
see also R. v. De Elespp [2002] A.J. No. 6702 at para 37 and 108&lt;Br&gt; 
R v.  Rombough [2006] A.J. No 1768 at para. 36 &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Biscette [1995] A.J. No. 557 &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Clarke (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)) [1991] O.J. No. 997 at para F
&lt;/ref&gt;
It generally always made out when there is a recantation.&lt;Ref&gt;R v U(FJ) &lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Dead witnesses===
Death of the witness is typically sufficient to establish necessity so long as the witness was the only source of information contained within the statement.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R v Taylor, 2012 ONCA 809 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Missing witnesses===

===Witness refuses to testify===
A witness who refuses to testify when all efforts to obtain that testimony have been taken to no avail will typically satisfy the requirement of necessity.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lavery, [1995] B.C.J. No.2713 (S.C.), at para. 9; &lt;br&gt;
R. v. C.C.B., [1999] S.J. No. 672 (P.C.), at paras. 5 - 9, and 23 - 31&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Goodstoney, 2005 ABQB 128&lt;br&gt;
R v Gardipy, [http://canlii.ca/t/frkpn 2012 SKCA 58] at 19&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; There is no onus on the Crown to prove why the complainant failed to testify.&lt;ref&gt;supra&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Child witnesses===
Where the experience testifying may be so traumatic at to prevent a chlid from testifying, the requirement of necessity will be satisfied.&lt;reF&gt; R. v. Rockey, [1996] 3 SCR 829 at 846;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/reF&gt;

While in some limited cases the court may have the child testify within the voir dire to support the reliability of the statment. More often, the statement will be admitted without oral evidence and the lack of cross examination will go to the weight of the prior statement.&lt;ref&gt;Sopinka, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2nd edition, at ss.6.55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability==
As always, the focus of analysis is to be on the hearsay dangers.&lt;ref&gt;R v MNP, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqgj5#par14 2012 MBQB 70 at 14]&lt;/ref&gt;
The primary danger of concern is the inability to cross-examine.&lt;ref&gt;R v Smith at 29&lt;/ref&gt; The court must be satisfied that the statement is sufficiently reliable to be considered as evidence.   The judge must determine whether the statement shows sufficient reliability to afford a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hawkins [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr51 1996 CanLII 154] (S.C.C.), (1996) 2 C.R. (5th) 245 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria of reliability deals with threshold reliability, not ultimate reliability to establish some fact.

There are two manners in which relability can be established: 1) by detailing the circumstances in which the statement was taken; or 2) “by showing that, in all of the circumstances, the ultimate trier of fact will be in a position to sufficiently assess the worth of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;See R v Blackman, [http://canlii.ca/t/1z1bv 2008 SCC 37] at 35&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Wilcox, 2001 NSCA 45 at 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the circumstances of the statement &quot;substantially negates&quot; the possibility that the declarant was untruthful or mistaken, then the statement is reliable.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Nguyen 2001 ABCA 98 at para. 26 citing R Smith, at para. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors===
Factors include:&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse, [2004] A.J. No. 12 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2004/2004abqb97/2004abqb97.html 2004 ABQB 97] at para. 53&lt;br&gt; 
R v Finta [http://canlii.ca/t/1npnp 1992 CanLII 2783] ONCA aff’d at [1994] 1 SCR 701&lt;br&gt;
R v Nguyen [http://canlii.ca/t/5rkq 2001 ABCA 98]&lt;/reF&gt;
# solemnity of the occasion&lt;ref&gt;Finta&lt;/ref&gt;
# the declarant’s adverse interest&lt;ref&gt;Finta&lt;/ref&gt;
# the declarant had particular means of knowledge of events described&lt;ref&gt;Finta&lt;/ref&gt;
# the statement distinguishes between first and second hand knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Finta&lt;/ref&gt;
# the statement was officially recorded and preserved&lt;ref&gt;Finta&lt;/ref&gt;
# the absence of a reason and/or motive to fabricate the statement ('''non-fabrication''')&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse&lt;/ref&gt;
# the timing of the statement in relation to the event spoken of ('''contemporaneity/remoteness''')&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse; Nguyen at 44, ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
# the demeanour of the declarant at the time of the making of the statement ('''demeanour''')&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse; Nguyen&lt;/ref&gt;
# the spontaneity of the statement ('''spontaneity''')&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse; Nguyen, ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
# the relationship between the declarant and the witness ('''relationship''')&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse&lt;/ref&gt;
# the detail given in the statement ('''detail''');&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the declarant could be mistaken ('''mistake'''); &lt;ref&gt;Morehouse&lt;/ref&gt;
# motive of the declarant ('''motive''')&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
# conduct of declarant&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the statement was recorded&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Burke,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2010/2010onsc6530/2010onsc6530.html 2010 ONSC 6530]&lt;/ref&gt; and
# “other”, including an “accurate record” - because it is clear from the cases that the list of factors is not closed and others may be added as appropriate to the particular circumstance.

Factors '''not''' to be considered in determining threshold admissibility:&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Goodstoney, [http://canlii.ca/t/1jvpb 2005 ABQB 128] at para 18&lt;/ref&gt;
#reliability or credibility of the declarant;
#general reputation of the declarant for truthfulness;
#prior or subsequent statements, consistent or not; and

#**In particular, the bar that Starr erected on the use of corroborative evidence in the threshold reliability assessment no longer applies. Instead of categorizing reliability factors into discreet, non-mutually exclusive threshold and ultimate stages, courts should now &quot;adopt a more functional approach... and focus on the particular dangers raised by the hearsay evidence sought to be introduced and on those attributes or circumstances relied upon by the proponent to overcome those dangers&quot;.[4] In effect, trial judges may now consider evidence going beyond the circumstances under which the statement was made at the threshold reliability stage, which includes corroborative and/or conflicting evidence.

A videotaped statement can often be admitted where the declarant is available for cross-examination as there are often sufficient tools to assess the weight of the statement. &lt;Ref&gt;R. v. M.N.P., [http://canlii.ca/t/fqgj5 2012 MBQB 70] &lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Presence of an Oath, Affirmation or Warning===
Where there is no oath, other evidence may substitute for it. This may include evidence from which it can be inferred from when the statement was made, the apparent solemnity of the location and occasion of the statement, an understanding of the importance to tell the truth.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Trieu 2005 CanLII 7884 (ON CA), (2005), 195 C.C.C. (3d) 373 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Opportunity for Cross-Examination===
The opportunity for Cross-examination &quot;alone provides significant indications of reliability&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
U(FJ) at p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; and so could provide &quot;an adequate assurance of threshold reliability to allow substantive admission of prior inconsistent statements&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of cross-examination as a sign of reliability &quot;depends on the nature of of the recantation of the witness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R v H(S), 14 C.R. (5th) 80, 37 W.C.B. (2d) 362 citing R. v. Conway, [http://canlii.ca/t/4rfx 1997 CanLII 2726] (ON CA), (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 579, 121 C.C.C. (3d) 397 and R. v. Tat (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; So where there is a mere denial or absence of memory of the prior statement, cross-examination would have less importance. 

{{reflist|2}}

===Corroboration===
It is important to remember that &quot;repeating a story to others doesn't make it reliable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; 
R v H(S), (1998) 14 C.R. (5th) 80, 37 W.C.B. (2d) 362 at para. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Special Types of Witnesses===
Elderly or infirm witnesses are classes of witnesses who present risk of being deceased by the time a trial comes about. 

For both of them their reliability can be established with evidence of their fitness at the time the statement was given, such as:
* medical evidence of any psychological reports regarding capacity&lt;ref&gt;R v Taylor [http://canlii.ca/t/ftvcw 2012 ONCA 809] at para. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* any prescriptions being taken as well as their effect upon their capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor at para. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motions and Applications Generally==
All motions are to be made inter partes, with notice to all the interested parties rather than ex parte, without notice to the other parties, &quot;unless there is a compelling need, established by evidence, for an ex parte order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mercier v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), [http://canlii.ca/t/fqf0d 2012 NSCA 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Notice===
Notice of Application must set out sufficient particulars to be meaningful. A notice without particulars will not constitute notice at all.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Kutynec (1992) 70 CCC (3d) 289 (ONCA)
(&quot;if the facts as alleged by the defence in its summary provide no basis for a finding of a Charter infringement... then the trial judge should dismiss the motion without hearing evidence.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Kovac, [1998] O.J. No. 2347 (Gen. Div.) (“In the adversarial trial system, the court, the accused, and the community are entitled to have two informed and prepared litigants conducting the case…The Crown is entitled to be represented in name and substance”)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections to the admissibility of evidence must be made at or before the evidence is tendered.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Phillips, [http://canlii.ca/t/56vd 2003 SKQB 330] at para. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Voir Dire==
A ''Voir Dire'' is in-trial hearing that is considered a separate hearing from the trial itself. It is known as a &quot;trial within a trial&quot; and designed to determine an issue separate from the of procedure or admissibility of evidence.

Procedurally, a voir dire for the validity of a warrant should proceed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Wilson, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2011/2011bcca252/2011bcca252.html#par69 2011 BCCA 252] at para 69&lt;/ref&gt;
:(a)      The trial judge should determine whether a voir dire is necessary and, if so, whether the calling of evidence should be permitted;
:(b)      If the judge accedes to the request to hold a voir dire and the accused wishes to cross-examine the informant, then the accused must obtain leave of the judge to do so. If the judge grants leave, then he or she can limit the scope of the cross-examination;
:(c)        Cross-examination should proceed to the extent permitted by the order granting leave;
:(d)      Re-examination, if any, should follow the cross-examination; and
:(e)      The trial judge should determine whether the record as amplified on the review could support the issuance of the warrant.

The failure of holding a voir dire to determine if potentially inadmissible evidence should be heard will not not always be fatal to the trial. Where the evidence is still tested and there is no prejudice to the accused to may still be valid. The court must consider whether the process was followed that served the same purpose as the voir dire.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. D.A.R., [http://canlii.ca/t/fqnc4 2012 NSCA 31] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

There seems to be some ability to make a motion for &quot;non-suit or directed verdict&quot; motion by the responding party to a voir dire application.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Gartland, 1981 CarswellOnt 1845, 7 W.C.B. 110 at para. 26 (the accused person must be afforded &quot;every essential procedural step and safeguard available to him on his trial on the merits of the substantive offence, in so far as it can be applicable...&quot;) cited also in R v T.(B.) [http://canlii.ca/t/frx58 2012 NSPC 59]&lt;/ref&gt;




{{reflist|2}}
===Evidence===
The evidence heard in a voir dire can become evidence of the trial proper where it has been found admissible in the voir dire and both parties consent.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jir,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2010/2010bcca497/2010bcca497.html#par10 2010 BCCA 497 at para. 10]; 
R. v. Ballendine,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2011/2011bcca221/2011bcca221.html#par84 2011 BCCA 221 at para. 84]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Charter applications require a factual record. They cannot be argued in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;
See MacKay v. Manitoba, 1989 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357&lt;br&gt; 
Danson v. Ontario, 1990 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1086&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Affidavits that are based on hearsay should be given little weight and generally should not be considered admissible as evidence on a Charter application.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Darrach, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 SCR 443&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Harris, [http://canlii.ca/t/6k4j 1994 CanLII 2986] (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;

==Re-opening Motions or Applications==
A motion, application or appeal that has not been decided on its merits can be re-opened at the discretion of the court. The applicant has a &quot;heavy onus&quot; to show that it is in the &quot;interests of justice&quot; to reopen the matter.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Blaker 1983 CanLII 308 (BC CA), (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 392, 393&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. T.L.C., 2012 BCCA 131 at 26&lt;/ref&gt;
#the length of delay between the dismissal and the application for reinstatement, and the adequacy of the explanation offered for that delay;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Findlay (1996), 79 B.C.A.C. 106 at para. 13&lt;/ref&gt;
#whether the Appellant contributed to the delay;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Blaker at p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;
#whether the Appellant had a bona fide intention to pursue the appeal throughout the proceedings;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Clymore, 1999 BCCA 225, 134 C.C.C. (3d) 476 at para. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
#whether the initial Order was made in error, or the Court was operating under some misunderstanding of the material facts;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Henry (1997), 100 B.C.A.C. 183 at para. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
#the effect reinstatement would have on public confidence in the administration of justice;&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Clymore at para. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
#the seriousness of the charges&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Blaker at p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;
#the merit of the appeal&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Blaker at p. 392; R. v. Clymore at para. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Charter Motions==
A Charter motion is a defence application alleging a breach of a provision of the Charter. 

In certain circumstances, trial judges may be permitted to raise a charter issue on behalf of the accused, particularly where they are self-represented.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Travers 2001 NSCA 71&lt;/ref&gt;
However, interference of the judge may amount to reasonable apprehension of bias.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Youngpine 2009 ABCA 89&lt;/ref&gt;

A Charter application must be heard by a &quot;court of competent jurisdiction&quot;. This is a court that has jurisdiction over the subject matter, the person and the remedy.&lt;ref&gt;R v Hynes 2001 SCC 82&lt;/ref&gt; This will generally be the trial judge.&lt;ref&gt;R v Rahey [1987] 1 SCR 588&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Burden and Standard of Proof===
The burden of proving a violation of any constitutional right is upon the applicant.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Collins, 1987 CanLII 84 at&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence must be &quot;sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent&quot; to establish the breach on a balance of probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;F.H. V. McDougall, [http://canlii.ca/t/20xm8 2008 SCC 53] at 46&lt;/ref&gt;

If the evidence is not sufficiently persuasive one way or another, the court must find there was no Charter violation.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hardenstine, 2010 BCSC 899 (CanLII), 2010 BCSC 899, paras. 27, 34, referring to R. v. Collins 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Standing===
A person must have personal Charter-protected rights to make a claim of a violation under the Charter and seek a remedy under s. 24(2) of the Charter. 

There is no rule of automatic standing in challenging a search. Only a party who can establish a personal right to privacy (i.e. a &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot;) can challenge a search.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Fankhanel, [http://canlii.ca/t/2bqs6 1999 CanLII 19075] (AB QB) at para. 12 citing R. v. Edwards (1996), 104 C.C.C.(3d) 137 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

An accused is not entitled to rely on a possible violation of the Charter rights of a co-accused.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Sandhu, (1993) 28 B.C.A.C. 203 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, where the accused is a passenger of the vehicle, the accused will not have standing to bring a Charter application as there is no privacy interest as a passenger, at least so diminished as to not have any Charter protection.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ramos, [http://canlii.ca/t/flmzz 2011 SKCA 63] (CanLII), 371 Sask. R. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

A child under the age of 12 cannot be charged with an offence &lt;ref&gt;YCJA s.2 defines &quot;young person&quot; as age 12 to 18&lt;/ref&gt;and so they do not have standing to make any claim for a breach of s.8 Charter rights.

In section 8 Charter applications, standing exists where it has been established that the accused had a [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Search and Seizure/Reasonable Expectation of Privacy|Reasonable Expectation of Privacy]] to the target of the search. 

{{reflist|2}}

===Notice===
An Accused must prove a Charter violation through conducting a ''voir dire''. Notice must give notice of a Charter application or else the application can be rejected without hearing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hamill (1984) 13 CCC 338 (BCCA)&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Kutynek&lt;Br&gt;  
R. v. Kutynec [1992] O.J. No. 347 at 16&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Vukelich (1996), 108 CCC 193 (BCCA) [http://canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/1996/1996canlii1005/1996canlii1005.html 1996 CanLII 1005]&lt;/ref&gt; Notice must outline some facts, sometimes with a supporting affidavit. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Vukelich, supra, at para 17; R. v. Pires, 2005 SCC at para. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no &quot;absolute entitlement to an evidentiary hearing&quot;, rather there must be a &quot;factual and legal basis&quot; for any motion.&lt;ref&gt;﻿R. v. Clancey [1992] OJ 3968 (Ont CJ (Gen Div))&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a duty upon defence to raise any Charter issues before trial.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Kovac [1998] O.J. No. 2347 (Ont. C.J.) at p.9 &lt;/ref&gt;

Verbal notice on the day of trial can be found insufficient notice.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Mide [1998] A.J. No. 1384 (Alta. P.C.) &lt;/ref&gt;

A threshold examination must be made to determine if on a balance of probabilities that the accused may be entitled to a Charter remedy and that the right was asserted as reasonably early as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Vukelich, supra&lt;/ref&gt; Where there is no timely notice, the Court may refuse an application.&lt;ref&gt;see Kutynec at para 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial judge had discretion to refuse to hear any motions with no notice or insufficient notice. The Court must balance the efficient use of court resources with the determination of court matters.
&lt;ref&gt;﻿R. v. Loveman (1992) 71 CCC (3d) 123&lt;/ref&gt;

See also: R. v. Wilson  [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2011/2011bcca252/2011bcca252.html 2011 BCCA 252]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Ahmed-Kadir and McFadyen, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcpc/doc/2011/2011bcpc250/2011bcpc250.html 2011 BCPC 250 ]

Failure to comply with rules of motion is not always fatal to the motion.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Tillotson,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc3390/2011onsc3390.html 2011 ONSC 3390]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the court rules have not been complied with, the court “has wide discretion in respect of procedure to facilitate a fair and expeditious determination of Charter issues”&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Blom 2002 CanLII 45026 (ON CA), (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 51 (C.A.) at 21 and 22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even a late request for a Charter application can still be heard by the court.

The court may refuse to hear a Charter application where no notice is given.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Rambissoon [2012] OJ 2305 (SCJ)&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to make full answer and defence does not include right to trial by ambush.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Darrach, 2000 SCC 46 at para. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the crown may not know the whole charter evidence before the motion, they are entitled to call evidence after hearing from the defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Deveau [http://canlii.ca/t/fn55t 2011 NSCA 85] &lt;/ref&gt;

Where insufficient notice is given on a constitutional challenge the court may refuse to entertain the argument.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Purtill [2012] OJ 2769 (SCJ)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a Charter issue is raised after the Crown's case, it cannot be based on the lack of evidence on the particular issue. By requiring the crown to present evidence supporting non-existent Charter motion is tantamount to shifting the burden on the crown to prove the absence of a breach.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Furlong [http://canlii.ca/t/frldw 2012 NLCA 29] &lt;/ref&gt;

The defence should not generally be permitted to raise a Charter motion at any point after the close of the Crown's case.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Chamberlain (1994), 30 C.R. (4th) 275 (Ont. C.A.) - judge was correct in exercising discretion to refuse to hear application &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Dwernychuk (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Alta. C.A.) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in the ultimate discretion of the trial judge to decide whether to permit a late Charter application.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Habhab [1997] A.J. No. 175 (Alta P.C.) p. 9-10&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence cannot object to the admission of evidence on the basis of a Charter violation where it is first raised in closing.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Kovac [1998] OJ 2347 (Gen. Div.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nagda [2000] O.J. No. 5694 (Ont. C.J.) - Charter raised 10 months after trial, but before closing submission&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to trial, the court may make inquiries into what Charter issues to be presented at trial.
&lt;ref&gt;﻿R v. Yorke (1992) 115 NSR (2d) (NSCA) (&quot;﻿It is basic to any adversarial system that a litigant applying for curial relief advise the court and the opponent of the application&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Kingsbury [1997] O.J. No. 5438 (Ont. C.J.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===On Appeal but Not Raised at Trial===
An accused may raise a new issue on appeal only with leave of the court.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Aisthorpe, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nzlk 2006 NLCA 40] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Even where leave is not requested, particularly where the accused is self-represented on appeal, the court may still consider whether to grant leave.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. O'Keefe (No. 2), [http://canlii.ca/t/frczp 2012 NLCA 25 ] at 24 to 27&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Briefs===
The crown does not need to file a brief responding to an accused's Charter motion. He may instead wait until the conclusion of the accused's evidence to decide.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Deveau, [http://canlii.ca/t/fn55t 2011 NSCA 85] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Excluding Public from Court */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Excluding witnesses==
Before the commencement of trial it is normally expected that all prospective witnesses will be excluded from the courtroom. This will usually be on the motion of one of the parties or the court itself.

The reason for excluding witnesses is because a witnesses ability to hear the evidence of other witnesses before testifying can negatively affect the credibility of the witness.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Smuk (1971), 3 CCC (2d) 457 (BCCA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public and Media Ban==
There are several types of publication ban permitted under the criminal code:
* An order restricting the publication of information identifying complainants of sexual offences [ [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec486.4 s.486.4] ]
* An order restricting publication of information identifying victims and witnesses [ [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec486.5 s.486.5(1)] ]
* An order restricting publication of information identifying a justice system participant [ s.486.5(2) ]

Under s. 486.6, anyone who violates  any of these orders (s. 486.4(1), (2) or (3) or 486.5(1) or (2)) can be liable for a summary conviction offence.

===General Publication Ban (s. 486(1),(2))===
Section 486.5(1) provides the court with the authority to make an order &quot;directing that any information that could identify the victim or witness shall not be published in any document or broadcast or transmitted in any way if the judge or justice is satisfied that the order is necessary for the proper administration of justice.&quot;

While section 486.5(2) provides the authority to make an order to not reveal &quot;information that could identify the justice system participant&quot;. 

This can be applied for by a prosecutor, a victim or a witness, a judge or justice. (s. 486.5(1))

Under s.486.5(4), the application must be made in writing and notice must be given to the prosecutor, accused, or any other person affected by the order that the judge specifies. The application itself as well as the contents of a hearing on the application cannot be published.(s. 486.5(6), (9))

The order shall only be made where the applicant establishes that the order is &quot;necessary for the proper administration of justice&quot;. (s. 486(1), (2), (5))

The factors that must be considered to decide whether to proceed are set out in s. 486.5(7):
:(a) the right to a fair and public hearing;
:(b) whether there is a real and substantial risk that the victim, witness or justice system participant would suffer significant harm if their identity were disclosed;
:(c) whether the victim, witness or justice system participant needs the order for their security or to protect them from intimidation or retaliation;
:(d) society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of offences and the participation of victims, witnesses and justice system participants in the criminal justice process;
:(e) whether effective alternatives are available to protect the identity of the victim, witness or justice system participant;
:(f) the salutary and deleterious effects of the proposed order;
:(g) the impact of the proposed order on the freedom of expression of those affected by it; and
:(h) any other factor that the judge or justice considers relevant.

===Sexual Offence Publication Ban===
Under s. 486.4 (1), the court may make an order &quot;directing that any information that could identify the complainant or a witness&quot; not be published, broadcast or transmitted for any sexual offences (as listed in s. 486.4(1)(a)).

Any complainant or witness under the age of 18 years old must be notified of their right to make an application for an order, and if requested by the complainant, prosecutor or witness under 18 years of age, the judge must made the order. (s. 486.4(2))

Similarly, under 486.4(3), for charges under 163.1, the court must make an order in relation to any person who comprises the subject of child pornographic materials.

{{Reflist|2}}

===Jury Identification Ban===
Under 631(6), the court or crown may order a publication ban on any information that may tend to identify jury members where it &quot;is necessary for the proper administration of justice&quot;.

==Public Access to Evidence==
A judge should only refuse a request from the media to access evidence from a preliminary inquiry after the conclusion of trial where:
#such an order is necessary to prevent a serious risk to the proper administration of justice because reasonably alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and
# the salutary effects of the ban outweigh the deleterious effects on the rights and interests of the parties and the public, including the effects on the right to free expression, the right of the accused to a fair and public trial, and the efficacy of the administration of justice.

The judge must rely on actual evidence and not simply judicial common sense and logic alone.&lt;ref&gt;
CTV Television Inc. v. R. et al., [http://canlii.ca/t/1q0cx 2006 MBCA 132] (CanLII)

==Excluding Public from Court==
Section 486 sets out the basic premise that all criminal proceedings are held in open court but persons can be excluded where it is &quot;in the interest of public morals, the maintenance of order, the proper administration of justice&quot; or injury to international relations or national defence/security.
 
{{quotation|
'''Exclusion of public in certain cases'''&lt;br&gt;
486. (1) Any proceedings against an accused shall be held in open court, but the presiding judge or justice may order the exclusion of all or any members of the public from the court room for all or part of the proceedings if the judge or justice is of the opinion that such an order is in the interest of public morals, the maintenance of order or the proper administration of justice or is necessary to prevent injury to international relations or national defence or national security.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Protection of witnesses under 18 and justice system participants'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the “proper administration of justice” includes ensuring that
:(a) the interests of witnesses under the age of eighteen years are safeguarded in all proceedings; and
:(b) justice system participants who are involved in the proceedings are protected.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Reasons to be stated'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) If an accused is charged with an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or (3) or section 163.1, 170, 171, 171.1, 172, 172.1, 172.2, 173, 212, 271, 272, 273, 279.01, 279.011, 279.02 or 279.03 and the prosecutor or the accused applies for an order under subsection (1), the judge or justice shall, if no such order is made, state, by reference to the circumstances of the case, the reason for not making an order.

These provisions can be used at any time in a proceeding, including trial and sentencing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Withdraw and Dismissal of Charges==

The crown can withdraw a charge at any time prior to plea. Otherwise, it must be with leave of the court and will sometimes require  consent of defence. There is a limited exception for abuse of process.

When an election to Superior Court court has been made, the charge can be withdrawn up until a preliminary inquiry is complete.

==Dismissal for Want of Prosecution==
A judge may make an order dismissing charges for &quot;want of prosecution&quot; resulting in the cessation of the proceedings.

The order can be made at any point up until the commencement of trial.

An applicant can make a motion seeking the dismissal of the charges. Typically, this will arise where a matter cannot proceed any further such as where:
# the judge has refused to adjourn a matter
# the Crown elects to &quot;offer no evidence&quot;  
# the crown has failed to attend or is otherwise incapable of moving a prosecution forward

The authority to dismiss charges is discretionary.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Fletcher and Smith 1990 CanLII 2507 (NS CA), (1990), 99 N.S.R. (2d) 258 at p. 260, para. 7
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A judge cannot make a order a dismissal for want of prosecution where the prosecutor is late in attending court.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Moreland, 1994 CanLII 1016 (BC SC)&lt;/ref&gt; And particularly where a guilty plea has already been entered.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Siciliano, 2012 ONCA 168&lt;/ref&gt;

A charge that is dismissed for want of prosecution may be recommenced with the laying of a new information or direct indictment only with written consent of the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General ([http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec485.1 485.1]).

      <comment>/* Judicial Stay of Proceedings */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Stay of Proceedings by Crown==
Under s. 579 the Crown may direct that a proceedings be stayed.
{{quotation|
'''Attorney General may direct stay'''&lt;br&gt;
579. (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for that purpose may, at any time after any proceedings in relation to an accused or a defendant are commenced and before judgment, direct the clerk or other proper officer of the court to make an entry on the record that the proceedings are stayed by his direction, and such entry shall be made forthwith thereafter, whereupon the proceedings shall be stayed accordingly and any recognizance relating to the proceedings is vacated.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec579 CCC]
}}

This is a right of the crown on the basis that all criminal proceedings are on behalf of the queen.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Cooke, Dingman and Whitton (1948), 91 C.C.C. 310 &lt;/ref&gt;

This form of stay is separate and apart from a judicial stay of proceedings.

{{Reflist|2}}
==Judicial Stay of Proceedings==
Courts have jurisdiction to stay criminal proceedings under s. 24(1) where putting a person on trial would amount to an &quot;abuse of process&quot; and violate the &quot;principles of fundamental justice&quot; under s. 7.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Jewitt [1985] 2 SCR 128&lt;br&gt; 
R v Kalanj [1989] 1 SCR 1594&lt;Br&gt;
R v Power [1994] 1 SCR 601&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of abuse of process arises from the common law.&lt;ref&gt;
R v O'Connor [1995] 4 SCR 411&lt;/ref&gt; It is now superceeded by the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R v Regan [2002] 1 SCR 297&lt;/ref&gt;

A Stay of Proceedings is the most drastic of remedies available to a court. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated:
:Charges that are stayed may never be prosecuted; an alleged victim will never get his or her day in-Court; society will never have the matter resolved by a trier of fact. For these reasons, a stay is reserved for only those cases of abuse where a very high threshold is met: &quot;the threshold for obtaining a stay of proceedings remains, under the Charter as under the common law doctrine of abuse of process, the 'clearest of cases'&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. O'Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1995/1995canlii51/1995canlii51.html]&lt;br&gt;
see Carosella, 1997 CanLII 402 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. La, 1997 CanLII 309 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 680&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297; and R. v. Taillefer&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Duguay, 2003 SCC 70, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 307&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A stay of proceedings is considered the “ultimate remedy” that is abosultely final, preventing the court from ever adjudicating the matter.&lt;Ref&gt;
Canada (Minister of Citizenship &amp; Immigration) v. Tobiass,1997 CanLII 322 (SCC), [1997] 3 SCR 391, 118 CCC (3d) 443 at para 86.&lt;/reF&gt;

Consequently, there is a high threshold on a stay of proceedings. It is only permissible in the “clearest of cases”.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12 (CanLII), 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 SCR 297 at para 53&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A clearest of case is one in which the integrity of the justice system is implicated.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Antinello, (1995), 165 AR 122, 97 CCC (3d) 126 (CA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Curragh, 1997 CanLII 381 (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 537, 113 CCC (3d) 481&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Spence, 2011 ONSC 2406, 85 CR (6th) 72&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Bjelland, 2009 SCC 38, [2009] 2 SCR 651&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. R.P.S, 2010 ABQB 418, 503 AR 233&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Robinson, 1999 ABCA 367, 250 AR 201&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Latimer, 1997 CanLII 405 (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 217, 112 CCC (3d) 193&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Gangl, 2011 ABCA 357&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Crown enters a stay of proceedings on their own is part of the Crown's royal prerogative which is not reviewable by the court. 

{{reflist|2}}

==Abuse of Process==
The test was set out as follows:
:&quot;Regardless of whether the abuse causes prejudice to the accused, because of an unfair trial, or to the integrity of the justice system, a stay of proceedings will only be appropriate when two criteria are met:
::(1)  the prejudice caused by the abuse in question will be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome; and
::(2)   no other remedy is reasonably capable of removing that prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;
RR. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc12/2002scc12.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Police Misconduct===
Police misconduct towards an accused in certain cases can lead to a stay of proceedings on the basis of abuse of process under the residual category.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ahmed, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc2551/2011onsc2551.html 2011 ONSC 2551]: obstruction charge stayed&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Maskell, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abpc/doc/2011/2011abpc176/2011abpc176.html 2011 ABPC 176]: impaired charges stayed&lt;/ref&gt;

It has applied where police have given false evidence&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Spagnoli and Shore, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc4843/2011onsc4843.html 2011 ONSC 4843] -- falsified anonymous source information&lt;/ref&gt;

The police are entitled to use &quot;lawful stratagems, even amounting to reasonable trickery, to gather evidence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; R. v Grandinetti, [http://canlii.ca/t/4pvr 2003 ABCA 307] at paras. 36-42&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been successfully argued that a video camera filming an accused in lockup using the toilet is a violation of s. 8 resulting in a stay of proceedings.&lt;REf&gt; 
R. v. Mok, 2012 ONCJ 291&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Prosecutorial Misconduct===

See: Nixon, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2011/2011scc34/2011scc34.html 2011 SCC 34 ]

===Lost evidence===

Not every case loss of evidence will infringe the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.  “Owing to the frailties of human nature, evidence will occasionally be lost” &lt;ref&gt;R. v. La, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr18 1997 CanLII 309] (SCC), [1997] 2 SCR 680, at para. 20&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Crown must explain the loss and satisfy the trial judge that it was not due to unacceptable negligence or an abuse of process.  If satisfactorily explained, the onus is on the accused to “establish actual prejudice to his or her right to make full answer and defence” &lt;ref&gt;La at para. 25&lt;/ref&gt;.  The principal consideration, in the explanation, “is whether the Crown or the police (as the case may be) took reasonable steps in the circumstances to preserve the evidence” &lt;ref&gt;La at para. 21&lt;br&gt;
and see R. v. Kociuk (R.J.), [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2011/2011mbca85/2011mbca85.html 2011 MBCA 85 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delay===
* [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Delay of Proceedings]]

===Arbitrary Detention===
See [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Arrest_and_Detention/Arrest_Procedure#Terms of Custody]] for details on detention procedure.

For a stay of proceedings to be made due to a breach of s.9 during detention post-arrest, there must be some connection between the charges and the breach.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Salisbury, [http://canlii.ca/t/fl6mt 2011 SKQB 153] at 11 (&quot; It is accepted that there was a breach of s. 9 of the Charter. However, it occurred after the commission of the offences and after the investigation had been completed. There was no connection between the breach and the charges. &quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About BrianJMcShane==
Forgive the formality of a middle inital. It seems another user has my name already registered. I am a current student of RMU's Professional and Technical Writing program. I graduated from Ocean County College (NJ) in 2009 with an associate's degree in Liberal Arts. This degree program is an attempt to reconcile interests between writing and literature and technical things like computers and coding. 
==On Writing==
While the ultimate dream is to write independently AND lucratively, necessity dictates some kind of degree in the likely event this does not go as planned. School seems a likelier candidate than lottery tickets.
==On Technology==
Despite being woefully out of practice, I spent two years in high school coding. I learned QBASIC, C++, and HTML. I can write code but cannot do math. Go figure...
==Other Plans==
I have played guitar since I was thirteen. I have been in two &quot;steady&quot; bands since then: once as a bass player and another as a keyboard player. One day I'd like to play my actual instrument in a band, rather than &quot;faking&quot; another one.</text>

I am a fairly experienced Wikipedian, and I have been editing Wikibooks for a few days. I am in the middle of writing a Wikibook called ''[[Geography of France]]''. I have made some minor edits on other books and have been irritated by the pending changes thing (I'm glad the English Wikipedia got rid of that). Anyway, as you can see from [[w:Special:Contributions/Liam987|my Wikipedia contributions]] I am not a vandal, and I am familiar with the WikiMedia interface and I understand the style of Wikibooks, so I would like the Reveiwer privilege sooner than I would normally get it. Thanks, [[User:Liam987|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#1c3f94 &quot;&gt;Liam987]]&lt;/span&gt;([[User talk:Liam987|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;&quot;&gt;'''talk'''&lt;/span&gt;]])''' 18:37, 19 March 2012 (UTC)

: {{comment}} Except on Wikijunior, the general public sees by default the current draft, '''not''' the most recent reviewed revision; that is, pending changes are visible by default.  It's not like edits won't be &quot;published&quot; until sighted.  So pending changes are a pretty trivial irritation.

: Understanding how Wikibooks differs from Wikipedia calls for a period of acclimation; and automatic promotion really doesn't take all that long for an active contributor  (about a month) &amp;mdash; assuming they meet the [[WB:Reviewers#Automatic criteria|criteria]], which do include some things it's possible to screw up on, like failing to have an email set and confirmed in [[Special:Preferences]], or using mostly blank edit summaries on one's edits.

: It isn't apparent there's cause here to subvert the reasonable and non-onerous autopromotion mechanism.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:20, 20 March 2012 (UTC)
::{{comment}}This is all that's stopping me asking for reviewer - there's a bit of a backlog of my changes unreviewed and if they were hidden be default that would be a shame.

It is too early to make definite plans for development beyond Mars, but we can list some of the options in this last step.  These are approximately in order of distance and difficulty, but there is no requirement to do them in any particular order.

===Main Belt Asteroids===

Development of the Main Belt between Mars and Jupiter is an extension of development in the Near Earth and Earth/Mars transfer regions.  Because all three regions have a range of eccentricities and inclinations there is no distinct boundary between them, but we arbitrarily assign the area between Mars and Jupiter as the Main Belt, and Jupiter's orbit and beyond as the Outer Solar System region.

The largest Main Belt object is the dwarf planet '''[[w:Ceres (dwarf planet)|1 Ceres]]'''.  Equatorial orbit velocity is 359 m/s, and equatorial rotation velocity is 94 m/s.  Thus to reach orbit requires 265 m/s net. This velocity can be reached by a mild steel centrifuge and easily by any advanced material.  Therefore cargo delivery from any other Main Belt asteroid, all of which are smaller than Ceres, does not require any rocket propulsion.  A 1.0 gravity Skyhook would be 7 km in radius and allow crew and equipment to be landed and take off at low acceleration, and a cost of 0.5% of net mass flow in reaction mass to maintain orbit.  

For smaller asteroids staying on the surface will be more of a problem than getting on and off.  For example, the 35th largest asteroid by diameter is '''[[w: 9 Metis|9 Metis]]''', which has an equatorial radius of 170 km and a mass of 1.47 x 10^19 kg.  This gives a surface gravity of 0.034 m/s^2 (0.34% of Earth).  The rotation period is 5.08 hours, which give a rotation velocity of 58.4 m/s and a centrifugal acceleration at the equator of 0.020 m/s^2.  So the net apparent gravity is only 0.014 m/s.  Indeed, the orbital velocity is 76.0 m/s, so it only takes 17.6 m/s ( 39 mph ) added velocity to reach orbit.  Therefore humans or low speed machinery can toss things into orbit, and a firm anchoring method will be needed to not do it accidentally.

===Outer Moons and Minor Planets===

===Kuiper Belt===

===Gas Giants===

===Oort Cloud and Beyond===

====Slow Interstellar====

People assume that a &quot;starship&quot; will be a metal can with big engines on the back.  Imagine colonizing a long period comet, one of the ones that came from the Oort cloud, and is heading back out there.  Comets are made of a mix of ices (water, methane, ammonia, CO2, etc) and rocky materials.  If there is not enough metals, get one of the metallic asteroids to match orbits with it.  Then build your colony out of the materials there.  Comets range in size up to 50 km in diameter, so there is plenty of stuff to build with.

The Oort cloud is many times the distance of the Earth from the Sun, and the velocity needed to get the comet to leave the Sun and head for another star is very small.  All the ices have some amount of hydrogen, and thus deuterium, which means if you know how to build fusion reactors, you have power for a long long time.  It will be a long trip, but you have a whole city worth of space to play in, with occasional side trips to other comets in the Oort cloud.

There are an estimated trillion comets out there, some will be along your route, more or less.  The average spacing is something like 6 AU, about the distance to Jupiter.  So you can in theory seed other comets as you pass by with new colonies.  If some people feel like it, they could head back to the Sun, the velocities are low enough to do that.

The requirements for this kind of slow star travel are fusion power, and knowing how to build permanent habitats in space.

“[P]robation is regarded as a rehabilitative sentencing tool...It is not considered punitive in nature.”

==Terms of Probation==

===Compulsory terms===
'''Compulsory terms''' of probation are listed at s. 732.1 (2):
{{quotation|
* keep the peace and be of good behaviour;
* appear before the court when required to do so by the court; and
* notify the court or the probation officer in advance of any change of name or address, and promptly notify the court or the probation officer of any change of employment or occupation.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec732.1 CCC]
}}

===Optional terms===
'''Optional terms''' of probation are listed at s. 732.1 (3):
{{quotation|
:(a) report to a probation officer
::(i) within two working days, or such longer period as the court directs, after the making of the probation order, and
::(ii) thereafter, when required by the probation officer and in the manner directed by the probation officer;
:(b) remain within the jurisdiction of the court unless written permission to go outside that jurisdiction is obtained from the court or the probation officer;
:(c) abstain from
::(i) the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances, or
::(ii) the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription;
:(d) abstain from owning, possessing or carrying a weapon;
:(e) provide for the support or care of dependants;
:(f) perform up to 240 hours of community service over a period not exceeding eighteen months;
:(g) if the offender agrees, and subject to the program director’s acceptance of the offender, participate actively in a treatment program approved by the province;
:(g.1) where the lieutenant governor in council of the province in which the probation order is made has established a program for curative treatment in relation to the consumption of alcohol or drugs, attend at a treatment facility, designated by the lieutenant governor in council of the province, for assessment and curative treatment in relation to the consumption by the offender of alcohol or drugs that is recommended pursuant to the program;
:(g.2) where the lieutenant governor in council of the province in which the probation order is made has established a program governing the use of an alcohol ignition interlock device by an offender and if the offender agrees to participate in the program, comply with the program; and
:(h) comply with such other reasonable conditions as the court considers desirable, subject to any regulations made under subsection 738(2), for protecting society and for facilitating the offender’s successful reintegration into the community.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec732.1 CCC]
}}

The primary goal of these conditions is rehabilitation and reintegration.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Kootenay [http://canlii.ca/t/1mcwg 2000 ABCA 289], (2000), 271 A.R. 156, 2000 ABCA 289 at paras. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;
Punishment is not a dominant purpose.&lt;ref&gt;R v Taylor at p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;

These goals concern the future behaviour of the offender, and are not shaped by the seriousness of the offence or degree of culpability.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Kootenay, 2000 ABCA 289&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Taylor [http://canlii.ca/t/1mcwg 1997 CanLII 9813] (SK CA), (1997), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 376 at 394 (Sask. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to impose optional terms, it must be established that the conditions are reasonable desirable for &quot;protecting society and facilitating the offender's successful reintegration into the community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Coombs, [http://canlii.ca/t/1hq6d 2004 ABQB 621], 369 A.R. 215 at para. 35 (Q.B.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions do not require a connection between the offence and the offender's past history.&lt;Ref&gt;
Kootenay, supra, at para. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The offender's inability to comply with the condition does not make it unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Coombs, [http://canlii.ca/t/1hq6d 2004 ABQB 621] at para. 39&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Vena, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m7r6 2005 ABQB 948] at 9&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, setting offenders up for future breaches should be of concern.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Coombs, supra at para. 39&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. P.A.G., [2000] O.J. No. 5837 (Ct. J.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Forrest (1992), 20 B.C.A.C. 293 (C.A.)&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. McLeod, [1992] Y.J. No. 96 (Sup. Ct.)&lt;br&gt;
R v. Okeymow, [http://canlii.ca/t/fr1pg 2012 ABQB 257] &lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A court cannot order the offender as part of probation to submit to &quot;a search and seizure of bodily substances&quot;. Moreover, the court cannot &quot;predetermine that any positive reading would constitute a breach of probation&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Shoker, [http://canlii.ca/t/1prjc 2006 SCC 44] (CanLII), [2006] 2 SCR 399 upholding R. v. Shoker, [http://canlii.ca/t/1jg0g 2004 BCCA 643] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community Service'''&lt;br&gt;
The judge may impose a requirement to complete up to 250 hours of community service under s.732.1(3)(f) and (h). It must be completed within 1 year.

'''Sexual Behaviour Assessment'''&lt;br&gt;
Certain jurisdictions have services through the local hospital that include sexual behaviour assessment. This typically includes phallometric testing.&lt;ref&gt;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_plethysmograph&lt;br&gt;
http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/text/pblct/forum/e141/141b_e.pdf&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
The assessment is intended to assist with risk assessment, determine whether there should be a s.161 order, and what treatment if any can be required. 

The assessment will either be included as part of a probationary order or else as part of an order for a pre-sentence report prior to sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Challes, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2008/2008canlii13360/2008canlii13360.html 2008 CanLII 13360] (ONSC)- pre-sentence assessement&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==When Probation can be Ordered==

A period of probation cannot be greater than three years.

Probation can be attached to any jail sentence equal or less than 2 years. The length of sentence is considered going forward from the date of sentence and not the global sentence before subtracting remand credit.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Mathieu, 2008 SCC 21 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc21/2008scc21.html], R. v. Goeujon 2006 BCCA 261 [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2006/2006bcca261/2006bcca261.html] &lt;/ref&gt;

Probation should not be imposed where it is impractical to make use of probation.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Cameron, 2011 ABCA 311 - Probation was removed from sentence on appeal where the offender was working in remote area far from any probation office&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Suspending of Sentence==
Under s. 731(1)(a), court may order that the sentence be suspended and the offender be placed on a period of probation:
{{Quotation|
'''Making of probation order'''&lt;br&gt;
731. (1) Where a person is convicted of an offence, a court may, having regard to the age and character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission,
:(a) if no minimum punishment is prescribed by law, suspend the passing of sentence and direct that the offender be released on the conditions prescribed in a probation order;...
&lt;P&gt;

'''When alternative measures may be used'''&lt;br&gt;
717. (1) Alternative measures may be used to deal with a person alleged to have committed an offence only if it is not inconsistent with the protection of society and the following conditions are met:
:(a) the measures are part of a program of alternative measures authorized by the Attorney General or the Attorney General’s delegate or authorized by a person, or a person within a class of persons, designated by the lieutenant governor in council of a province;
:(b) the person who is considering whether to use the measures is satisfied that they would be appropriate, having regard to the needs of the person alleged to have committed the offence and the interests of society and of the victim;
:(c) the person, having been informed of the alternative measures, fully and freely consents to participate therein;
:(d) the person has, before consenting to participate in the alternative measures, been advised of the right to be represented by counsel;
:(e) the person accepts responsibility for the act or omission that forms the basis of the offence that the person is alleged to have committed;
:(f) there is, in the opinion of the Attorney General or the Attorney General’s agent, sufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution of the offence; and
:(g) the prosecution of the offence is not in any way barred at law.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Restriction on use'''&lt;Br&gt;
(2) Alternative measures shall not be used to deal with a person alleged to have committed an offence if the person
:(a) denies participation or involvement in the commission of the offence; or
:(b) expresses the wish to have any charge against the person dealt with by the court.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Admissions not admissible in evidence'''&lt;Br&gt;
(3) No admission, confession or statement accepting responsibility for a given act or omission made by a person alleged to have committed an offence as a condition of the person being dealt with by alternative measures is admissible in evidence against that person in any civil or criminal proceedings.
&lt;P&gt;
'''No bar to proceedings'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The use of alternative measures in respect of a person alleged to have committed an offence is not a bar to proceedings against the person under this Act, but, if a charge is laid against that person in respect of that offence,
:(a) where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the person has totally complied with the terms and conditions of the alternative measures, the court shall dismiss the charge; and
:(b) where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the person has partially complied with the terms and conditions of the alternative measures, the court may dismiss the charge if, in the opinion of the court, the prosecution of the charge would be unfair, having regard to the circumstances and that person’s performance with respect to the alternative measures.

}}

The criminal code permits the provincial government to deal with certain criminal charges outside of the court system. This is usually in the form of diversionary programming available to first-time offenders of minor offences where the accused is prepared to accept responsibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Fines are a form of financial punishment available as a sentencing option for a judge.&lt;Ref&gt;s. 734; 716&lt;/ref&gt; A fine is available where the court believes that the accused is &quot;able to pay&quot; the fine&lt;ref&gt; 734(2)&lt;/ref&gt; and where a pecuniary punishment is considered proportionate to the offence and offender. This focus on ability to pay, found in s. 734(2), prevents &quot;offenders from being fined amounts that they are truly unable to pay, and to correspondingly reduce the number of offenders who are incarcerated in default of payment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Topp, 2011 SCC 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden is upon the party seeking the fine to prove that the offender has the ability to pay on a balance of probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Topp&lt;/ref&gt; The party does not need to identify or locate the specific assets available, rather &quot;may rely on indirect evidence&quot; to prove an ability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Topp&lt;/ref&gt;

Absent evidence to the contrary, the court may infer an ability to pay where the offender has been in &quot;receipt of illegally-obtained funds&quot;. This must take into account the  &quot;amount of funds acquired&quot; and &quot;the length of time that has passed between the acquisition of the funds and the imposition of sentence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R v Topp&lt;/ref&gt;

To issue a fine a judge must order:
# an amount to be paid
# the mode of payment
# the time(s) that the fine should be paid

The judge may add further requirements as seen fit.

If the offender fails to pay, it is on the offender to show proof that they are unable to pay in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Desjardins, 1996 NBCA; see also R. v. Wu, [2003] 3 SCR 530&lt;/ref&gt; 


{{reflist|2}}
==Default==
Where an offender has a fine imposed by the court, the court may order that a period of jail time in default may be substituted for the fine:
{{quotation|
734. &lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Meaning of default of payment'''&lt;Br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of this section and sections 734.1 to 737, a person is in default of payment of a fine if the fine has not been paid in full by the time set out in the order made under section 734.1.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Imprisonment in default of payment'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Where an offender is fined under this section, a term of imprisonment, determined in accordance with subsection (5), shall be deemed to be imposed in default of payment of the fine.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Determination of term'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) The term of imprisonment referred to in subsection (4) is the lesser of
:(a) the number of days that corresponds to a fraction, rounded down to the nearest whole number, of which
::(i) the numerator is the unpaid amount of the fine plus the costs and charges of committing and conveying the defaulter to prison, calculated in accordance with regulations made under subsection (7), and
::(ii) the denominator is equal to eight times the provincial minimum hourly wage, at the time of default, in the province in which the fine was imposed, and
:(b) the maximum term of imprisonment that the court could itself impose on conviction or, if the punishment for the offence does not include a term of imprisonment, five years in the case of an indictable offence or six months in the case of a summary conviction offence.
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Warrant of committal'''&lt;br&gt;
734.7 (1) Where time has been allowed for payment of a fine, the court shall not issue a warrant of committal in default of payment of the fine
:(a) until the expiration of the time allowed for payment of the fine in full; and
:(b) unless the court is satisfied
::(i) that the mechanisms provided by sections 734.5 and 734.6 are not appropriate in the circumstances, or
::(ii) that the offender has, without reasonable excuse, refused to pay the fine or discharge it under section 736.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Reasons for committal'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where no time has been allowed for payment of a fine and a warrant committing the offender to prison for default of payment of the fine is issued, the court shall state in the warrant the reason for immediate committal.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Period of imprisonment'''&lt;br&gt;
(2.1) The period of imprisonment in default of payment of the fine shall be specified in a warrant of committal referred to in subsection (1) or (2).
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Effect of imprisonment'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The imprisonment of an offender for default of payment of a fine terminates the operation of sections 734.5 and 734.6 in relation to that fine.&lt;P&gt;
1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1999, c. 5, s. 35.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Definition of “penalty”'''&lt;br&gt;
734.8 (1) In this section, “penalty” means the aggregate of
:(a) the fine, and
:(b) the costs and charges of committing and conveying the defaulter to prison, calculated in accordance with regulations made under subsection 734(7).
&lt;P&gt;
'''Reduction of imprisonment on part payment'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The term of imprisonment in default of payment of a fine shall, on payment of a part of the penalty, whether the payment was made before or after the execution of a warrant of committal, be reduced by the number of days that bears the same proportion to the number of days in the term as the part paid bears to the total penalty.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Minimum that can be accepted'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) No amount offered in part payment of a penalty shall be accepted after the execution of a warrant of committal unless it is sufficient to secure a reduction of sentence of one day, or a whole number multiple of one day, and no part payment shall be accepted until any fee that is payable in respect of the warrant or its execution has been paid.
&lt;P&gt;
'''To whom payment made'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Payment may be made under this section to the person that the Attorney General directs or, if the offender is imprisoned, to the person who has lawful custody of the prisoner or to any other person that the Attorney General directs.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Application of money paid'''&lt;Br&gt;
(5) A payment under this section shall be applied firstly to the payment in full of costs and charges, secondly to the payment in full of any victim surcharge imposed under section 737, and then to payment of any part of the fine that remains unpaid.
&lt;P&gt;
1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1999, c. 5, s. 36, c. 25, s. 19(Preamble).

==Victim Fine Surcharge==
According to section 737, an &quot;offender who is convicted or discharged...shall pay a victim surcharge&quot;. The amount will be either (1) 15% of the fine imposed; or (2) $50 for summary offences or $100 for indictable offences.&lt;ref&gt;s.737(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The fine is presumed payable immediately unless the court is satified that time is needed to pay.

Under s. 737(5), &quot;[w]hen the offender establishes to the satisfaction of the court that undue hardship to the offender or the dependants of the offender would result from payment of the victim surcharge, the court may, on application of the offender, make an order exempting the offender&quot; from paying the fine. The court must give reasons for this exemption.&lt;ref&gt; s.737(6)&lt;/ref&gt; If no request is made, the fine is presumed to be imposed.&lt;ref&gt;R. v.

A judge has the power to impose a sentence of imprisonment under the authority of s. 718.3 and 787:

{{quotation|
'''Degrees of punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
718.3 (1) Where an enactment prescribes different degrees or kinds of punishment in respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits the offence.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Discretion respecting punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where an enactment prescribes a punishment in respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits the offence, but no punishment is a minimum punishment unless it is declared to be a minimum punishment.
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1997, c. 18, s. 141; 2002, c. 1, s. 182.
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
'''General penalty'''&lt;Br&gt;
787. (1) Unless otherwise provided by law, everyone who is convicted of an offence punishable on summary conviction is liable to a fine of not more than five thousand dollars or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or to both.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec718.3 CCC]
}}

== Intermittent Sentence==
{{quotation|
'''Intermittent sentence'''&lt;br&gt;
732. (1) Where the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of ninety days or less on an offender convicted of an offence, whether in default of payment of a fine or otherwise, the court may, having regard to the age and character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and the availability of appropriate accommodation to ensure compliance with the sentence, order
:(a) that the sentence be served intermittently at such times as are specified in the order; and
:(b) that the offender comply with the conditions prescribed in a probation order when not in confinement during the period that the sentence is being served and, if the court so orders, on release from prison after completing the intermittent sentence.&lt;br&gt;

'''Application to vary intermittent sentence'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) An offender who is ordered to serve a sentence of imprisonment intermittently may, on giving notice to the prosecutor, apply to the court that imposed the sentence to allow it to be served on consecutive days.&lt;br&gt;

Court may vary intermittent sentence if subsequent offence&lt;br&gt;

(3) Where a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment on a person who is subject to an intermittent sentence in respect of another offence, the unexpired portion of the intermittent sentence shall be served on consecutive days unless the court otherwise orders.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec732 CCC]
}}

Intermittent sentences cannot exceed 90 days. This includes consecutive sentences totaling more than 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Balachanoff, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2003/2003bcca433/2003bcca433.html 2003 BCCA 433]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermittent sentences &quot;strike a legislative balance between the denunciatory and deterrent functions of 'real jail time' and the rehabilitative functions of preserving the offender's employment, family relationships and responsibilities, and obligations to the community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Middleton (2009), 388 N.R. 89, at para 45&lt;/ref&gt;

A court has no authority to vary a sentence from an intermittent sentence to a non-intermittent sentence a once it has been ordered.&lt;ref&gt;R v Germaine (1980) 39 NSR (2d) 177 at para. 5; R v Jules [1988] BCJ No 1605&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some suggestion that the court has some jurisdiction to vary the entry and exit time of a conditional sentence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. E.K., [http://canlii.ca/t/frc2s 2012 BCPC 132]&lt;br&gt;
See [[Canadian_Criminal_Procedure_and_Practice/Trials/Role_of_Trial_Judge#Doctrine_of_Functus_Officio]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==No Contact Orders while in Prison==
Under s. 743.21, a court may order that for the duration of serving a sentence that the offender be subject to no-contact conditions.

{{quotation|
'''Non-communication order'''&lt;br&gt;
743.21 (1) The sentencing judge may issue an order prohibiting the offender from communicating, directly or indirectly, with any victim, witness or other person identified in the order during the custodial period of the sentence, except in accordance with any conditions specified in the order that the sentencing judge considers necessary.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Failure to comply with order'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Every person who fails, without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies on that person, to comply with the order
:(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or
:(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding eighteen months.&lt;br&gt;

Sections 738 to 741.2 deal with Restitution to victim of crime. 

Restitution is intended to rehabilitate the offender by making him immediately responsible for the loss of the victim. It also gives the victim a speedy means of getting money back.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Fitzgibbon, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1005  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1990/1990canlii102/1990canlii102.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Yates, 2002 BCCA 583 [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2002/2002bcca583/2002bcca583.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Restitution can be ordered to require the offender to pay a sum of money to compensate a party for a proven loss. Restitution is ordered as either a term of a probation order or else as a stand alone restitution order.&lt;ref&gt;s. 738&lt;/ref&gt; A stand alone restitution order has no time limit for repayment and may be registered as a civil judgement&lt;ref&gt;s. 741&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn could be used to garnish wages and seize property.

Whether to grant restitution is considered as part of the &quot;totality&quot; of the punishment.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Siemens, 1999 CanLII 18651 (MB C.A.)[http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/1999/1999canlii18651/1999canlii18651.html&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the offender should have some ability to pay the amount, either at sentencing or in the future.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Dashner, (1973) BCCA; R. v. Biegus, 1999 CanLII 3815 (ON C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1999/1999canlii3815/1999canlii3815.html]; R. v. Brown (1999) BCCA; R. v. Fitzgibbon, supra&lt;/ref&gt; The court must take into consideration the offender's ability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ratt, 2005 SKCA 110; R. v. R. v. DeBay, 2001 NSCA 48 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/2001/2001nsca48/2001nsca48.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, where the offence is particularly egregious, such as a breach of trust, a restitution order may be made even where there does not appear to be any likelihood of repayment.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Yates 2002 BCCA 583 at paras. 12 and 17 &lt;/ref&gt;

Objectives and factors for the discretionary ordering restitution are as follows:&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Devgan [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1999/1999canlii2412/1999canlii2412.html 1999 CanLII 2412 (ON C.A.)] &lt;br&gt;

R. v. Scherer, (1984), 16 C.C.C.(3d) 30 (Ont. C.A.) at 37-38&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Salituro, (1990), 56 C.C.C.(3d) 350 (Ont. C.A.) at 372-73&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Horne 1996 CanLII 8051 (ON S.C.), (1996), 34 O.R.(3d) 142 (Gen. Div.) At 148-49&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Carter at 75 - 76. &lt;/ref&gt;:
#An order for compensation should be made with restraint and caution;&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Zelensky, 1978 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1978] 2 SCR 940&lt;/ref&gt;
#The concept of compensation is essential to the sentencing process:
##it emphasizes the sanction imposed upon the offender;
##it makes the accused responsible for making restitution to the victim;
##it prevents the accused from profiting from crime; and
##it provides a convenient, rapid and inexpensive means of recovery for the victim;
#A sentencing judge should consider;
##the purpose of the aggrieved person in invoking s. 725(1);
##whether civil proceedings have been initiated and are being pursued; and
##the means of the offender.
#A compensation order should not be used as a substitute for civil proceedings.  Parliament did not intend that compensation orders would displace the civil remedies necessary to ensure full compensation to victims. 
# It should not be ordered when the amount is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Castro, [2010] ONCA 718 at paras. 26 and 43&lt;/ref&gt;
#A compensation order is not the appropriate mechanism to unravel involved commercial transactions;
#A compensation order should not be granted when it would require the criminal court to interpret written documents to determine the amount of money sought through the order.  The loss should be capable of ready calculation.
#A compensation order should not be granted if the effect of provincial legislation would have to be considered in order to determine what order should be made;
#Any serious contest on legal or factual issues should signal a denial of recourse to an order;
#Double recovery can be prevented by the jurisdiction of the civil courts to require proper accounting of all sums recovered; and
#A compensation order may be appropriate where a related civil judgment has been rendered unenforceable as a result of bankruptcy.

No single factor should be determinative on whether restitution should be ordered.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Castro, 2010 ONCA 718 at para. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the order is to be part of the sentence, not to compensate for losses.&lt;ref&gt;
See  R. v. Castro, [2010] ONCA 718 at paras. 26 and 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec380.3 section 380.3(1)], when a person is convicted of fraud, the court is specifically required to inquire into whether restitution is being sought from the victim's involved. If the judge decides not to order restitution he must under s. 380.3(5), give reasons for the decision.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Once the Crown proves the elements of a regulatory or provincial offence or otherwise establishes a duty upon the accused, the onus is on the accused to establish due diligence. This must be proven on a balance of probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Ariganello, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvp39 2013 ONCJ 13] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

Due diligence requires the accused to &quot;take all reasonable steps&quot; to avoid the harm that resulted. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, [1997] B.C.J. No. 1744 (S.C.), at para. 55 (&quot;In other words, an accused must take all reasonable steps to avoid harm. However, that does not mean an accused must take all conceivable steps.&quot;)
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary that the accused take all conceivable steps, however.&lt;ref&gt;BC Hydro and Power Authority at para. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

In assessing due diligence, WD test for credibility does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Carpentier [http://canlii.ca/t/1m1bb 2005 MBCA 134] (CanLII) at para. 27&lt;br&gt;
Ariganello at para. 18&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Defaria [2008] O.J. No. 5427, [http://canlii.ca/t/223td 2008 ONCJ 687] (CanLII) at para. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused must show that he took “all reasonable care” to avoid committing the offence.

This is considered from the perspective of a reasonable person in similar circumstances.
This does not mean that the accused would be required to perform acts that would put the accused in unreasonable danger. 

'''Industry Standards and Practices'''&lt;br&gt;
Compliance with industry standard practice is a factor that weighs in favour of due diligence but it not determinative.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Emil K. Fishing Corp.; R. v. Kukuljan, 2008 BCCA 490 (CanLII), [2008] B.C.J. No. 2326; 304 D.L.R. (4th) 725 leave refused&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bui, [2005] O.J. No. 1456(C.J.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry standards and practice cannot be of any value to due diligence if it is established that the standard is insufficient. It then cannot be used as a shield against responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. London Excavators &amp; Trucking Ltd. reflex, (1997) 26 C.C.E.L.(2d) 132(Ont. P.C.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Pilen Construction of Canada Ltd. [1999] O.J. No. 5650, affd [2001] O.J. No. 2980 (S.C.J.)&lt;br&gt; 
Libman, Regulatory Offences in Canada, at page 7-27 (“…a defendant cannot hide behind commonly accepted standards of care if, in the circumstances, due diligence warrants a higher level of care.”)&lt;br&gt;

Generally, intoxication does not excuse a criminal act where the accused has the requisite intent. As it were a &quot;drunken intent is nonetheless an intent.&quot;
R. v. Canute, [http://canlii.ca/t/1db1b 1993 CanLII 403] (BCCA) at  49&lt;/ref&gt;

The law recognizes three degrees of intoxication:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Daley, [http://canlii.ca/t/1v5dr 2007 SCC 53], [2007] 3 SCR 523 at para 41&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Mild Intoxication''': alcohol-induced relaxation of inhibitions and acceptable behaviour. This does not affect the mens rea of an offence
# '''Advanced Intoxication''': intoxication to the point of the accused lacking any specific intent to an offence. There is a impairment of the accused's foresight of the consequences of his acts, raising a reasonable doubt on the requisite mens rea. This will only apply to specific intent offences.
# '''Extreme Intoxication''':  intoxication to the point of automatism-like state. This degree of intoxication negates the voluntariness of the accused's actions. It is a rare defence that only applies to non-violent offences (as per s. 33.1)

{{reflist|2}}

==Offences of violence==

{{quotation|
'''Self-induced Intoxication'''
&lt;br&gt;
'''When defence not available'''&lt;br&gt;
33.1 (1) It is not a defence to an offence referred to in subsection (3) that the accused, by reason of self-induced intoxication, lacked the general intent or the voluntariness required to commit the offence, where the accused departed markedly from the standard of care as described in subsection (2).
&lt;br&gt;
'''Criminal fault by reason of intoxication'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) For the purposes of this section, a person departs markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society and is thereby criminally at fault where the person, while in a state of self-induced intoxication that renders the person unaware of, or incapable of consciously controlling, their behaviour, voluntarily or involuntarily interferes or threatens to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Application'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) This section applies in respect of an offence under this Act or any other Act of Parliament that includes as an element an assault or any other interference or threat of interference by a person with the bodily integrity of another person.
|[http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec33.1 CCC]
}}

Section 33.1 will exclude intoxication as a defence for general intent offences or involuntariness due to intoxication where the following conditions are met:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bouchard-Lebrun, [http://canlii.ca/t/fp2r0 2011 SCC 58] (CanLII), [2011] 3 SCR 575&lt;/ref&gt;
# the accused was intoxicated at the time of the offence;
# the intoxication was self-induced; and 
# the accused departed from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society by interfering or threatening to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person

This section applies to any mental condition that arises directly from a state of intoxication, including toxic psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Principles ==
The defence of duress exists both in statute under s. 17 of the criminal Code and under the common law.

The common law defence pre-dates the provisions of s. 17, however, by function of s.8 of the Criminal Code, which preserves all common law defences, the broader common law defence is still considered.&lt;ref&gt; Section 8 (3) state: &lt;br&gt;
'''Common law principles continued'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a defence to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any other Act of Parliament except in so far as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of Parliament.
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 8; 1993, c. 28, s. 78; 2002, c. 7, s. 138.
&lt;/reF&gt;

The distinction between the two is that the s.17 defence does not apply to parties, including aiders and abettors.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Wilson, [http://canlii.ca/t/flqd8#par50 2011 ONSC 3385 at 50]&lt;/ref&gt; The common law, however, can still apply for parties to the offence.

Duress is an excuse-based defence.

'''Compulsion by threats'''&lt;br&gt;
17. A person who commits an offence under compulsion by threats of immediate death or bodily harm from a person who is present when the offence is committed is excused for committing the offence if the person believes that the threats will be carried out and if the person is not a party to a conspiracy or association whereby the person is subject to compulsion, but this section does not apply where the offence that is committed is high treason or treason, murder, piracy, attempted murder, sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm, aggravated sexual assault, forcible abduction, hostage taking, robbery, assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, unlawfully causing bodily harm, arson or an offence under sections 280 to 283 (abduction and detention of young persons).

The requirements of s.17 to have “presence” and “immediacy” is unconstitutional for violating s.7.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Ruzic 2001 SCC 24&lt;/reF&gt; Thus, that portion of the section has no force or effect.

Despite the existence of the common law defence, all offences listed as defence exceptions in s.17 cannot be covered by common law.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Mohamed, 2012 ONSC 1715 at 20&lt;/ref&gt;
Any included offences to offences to the exempted offences listed in s. 17 are also exempted from the statutory defence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Li 2002 CanLII 18077 (ONCA) -- kidnapping charge was also exempted as part of the abduction charge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common Law==
At common law, duress is an available defence to any offences short of murder. It must be shown that the accused's will was overborne by threats of death or serious personal injury such that accused is not acting voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. T.L.C., [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abpc/doc/2004/2004abpc79/2004abpc79.html 2004 ABPC 79]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three elements to the defence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Wilson 2011 ONSC 3385 at 61&lt;/ref&gt; It must be established that:
# the accused must be subject to a “threat of death or serious physical injury” 
# on an objective standard, no safe avenue of escape existed &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hibbert, [1995] 2 SCR 973 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1995/1995canlii110/1995canlii110.html 1995 CanLII 110]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Keller, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/1998/1998abca357/1998abca357.html 1998 ABCA 357] &lt;/ref&gt; or any “reasonable opportunity to render the threat ineffective.”&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 2011 ONSC 3385 at 61&lt;/ref&gt;
#  “there must be proportionality between the threat and the criminal act alleged”&lt;ref&gt; Wilson 2011 ONSC 3385 at 61&lt;/ref&gt;

If the defence is raised, the Crown has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one of the elements is not available.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson at 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat need not be of immediate death or bodily harm. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ruzic, 2001 SCC 24, [2001] 1 SCR 687 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2001/2001scc24/2001scc24.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence will not be available through the common law where the accused puts themselves in a position where they are likely to recieve threats.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Li,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2002/2002canlii18077/2002canlii18077.html 2002 CanLII 18077 (ON CA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;the defence in Canada, ...[is] an objective-subjective standard, as in the case of the defence of necessity&quot; (Ruzic at para 71).

A valid excuse for violating the law is on the basis of an officially induced error of law.  &lt;ref&gt;R v Jorgensen at 28 to 37&lt;/ref&gt; The defence arises where the accused is given advice in error that the accused relies upon in doing the criminal act. 

Officially induced error is available as a defence to prevent morally blameless individuals, who believe they are acting in a lawful manner, from being convicted.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jorgensen 1995 CanLII 85 (S.C.C.), (1995), 4 S.C.R. 55 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Halloran, 2010 ONSC 4321&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The elements that must be proven are:
#The error was one of law or mixed law and fact
#The accused considered the legal consequences of her actions
#The advice obtained came from an appropriate official
#The advice was reasonable in the circumstances
#The advice obtained must be erroneous
#The accused must demonstrate reliance on the official advice

Each element must be proven on a balance of probabilities by the accused.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Jorgensen&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an exception to the principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse.

The defence arises in part out of the overly complex nature of regulation. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Jorgensen, 1995 CanLII 85 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 55 at para. 25&lt;br&gt;
Lévis (City) v. Tétreault; Lévis (City) v. 2629-4470 Québec inc., 2006 SCC 12 (CanLII), 2006 SCC 12 at 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the defence is to prevent injustices where the ““state approving conduct with one hand and seeking to bring criminal sanction for that conduct with the other”&lt;ref&gt;R v Jorgensen at para 30&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful application will result in a stay of proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Jorgensen&lt;/ref&gt;

Provocation is a partial defence for the charge of first or second degree murder.
 
{{Quotation|
'''Murder reduced to manslaughter'''&lt;br&gt;
232. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.
&lt;br&gt;
'''What is provocation'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) A wrongful act or an insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the accused acted on it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Questions of fact'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of this section, the questions
:(a) whether a particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and
:(b) whether the accused was deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation that he alleges he received,&lt;br&gt;

are questions of fact, but no one shall be deemed to have given provocation to another by doing anything that he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything that the accused incited him to do in order to provide the accused with an excuse for causing death or bodily harm to any human being.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec232 CCC] 
}}

A trial judge must put the defence to the trier-of-fact where there is evidence of an &quot;air of reality&quot; to the defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cinous, [http://canlii.ca/t/51tb 2002 SCC 29], [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 50, 53&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Osolin, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frvz 1993 CanLII 54] (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there must be sufficient evidential basis with respect to each element of the defence. This requires that the evidence must be &quot;reasonably capable of supporting the inferences necessary to make out the defence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R v. Tran, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dk6j 2010 SCC 58] (CanLII), [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350 at para. 41&lt;/ref&gt;
There must be evidence upon which a “reasonable jury acting judicially” could find the defence successful.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tran, at para. 41&lt;/ref&gt; In deciding, the judge must consider &quot;the totality of the evidence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Krasniqi, [http://canlii.ca/t/fsh9z 2012 ONCA 561] (CanLII), 295 O.A.C. 223, at para. 52
&lt;/ref&gt;

The provocation must be a subjectively held belief that is reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Thibert, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frf6 1996 CanLII 249] (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37 at para. 4&lt;br&gt;
See also Tran at para. 23&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; This requires:
# a wrongful act or insult of such a nature that it is sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control (objective) and 
# the accused act upon that insult on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool (subjective) 

On the objective element, the &quot;normal temperament and level of self-control&quot; refers to a person who is not &quot;exceptionally excitable, pugnacious or in a state of drunkenness&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Hill, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftss 1986 CanLII 58] (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 313 at p. 331&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The ordinary person is one that can be ascribed the &quot;particular characteristics that are not peculiar or idiosyncratic&quot; such as &quot;sex, age, or race&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Hill, at p. 331; see also Thibert, at para. 14&lt;/ref&gt; This intends to &quot;contextualize the objective standard&quot; but not so far as to &quot;individualize it&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;
Tran at para. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy behind the objective standard is the desire to &quot;seek to encourage conduct that complies with certain societal standards of reasonableness and responsibility.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
Hill at pp. 324-25&lt;br&gt;
See also R. v. Mayuran, [http://canlii.ca/t/frtzh 2012 SCC 31]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of anger can be used to support or demean the availability of the defence. It depends on whether the anger is the fuel for &quot;cold blooded revenge&quot; or the fuel for sudden rage resulting in a loss of control.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Angelis, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvxsv 2013 ONCA 70] (CanLII) at para. 36&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
A defence of entrapment is available when:&lt;ref&gt;R.v.Mack [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftb1 1988 CanLII 24 (S.C.C.)], (1988) 44 C.C.C. (3d) 513 (S.C.C.) at p.559&lt;/ref&gt;
 
#the authorities provide a person with an opportunity to commit an offence without acting on a reasonable suspicion that this person is already engaged in criminal activity or pursuant to bona fide inquiries;
#although having such a reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a bona fide inquiry, they go beyond providing an opportunity and induce the commission of an offence.
 
&quot;An exception to [the rule establishing entrapment] arises when the police undertake a bona fide investigation directed at an area where it is reasonably suspected that criminal activity is occurring.  When such a location is defined with sufficient precision, the police may present any person associated with the area with the opportunity to commit the particular offence.  Such randomness is permissible within the scope of a bona fide inquiry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R.v.Barnes [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsnz 1991 CanLII 84 (S.C.C.)], (1991) 63 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at pp.10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

An undercover officer who attempts to buy drugs from someone suspected of selling drugs does not constitute entrapment.&lt;ref&gt;
Barnes v. The Queen, 1991 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449&lt;/ref&gt;

A defence of entrapment cannot be advanced until after the crown has proven all of the elements of the offence.&lt;Ref&gt;

Evidence constitutes an &quot;alibi&quot; where &quot;the evidence at issue [is] determinative of the final issue of guilt or innocence of the accused.&quot; The evidence suggests that &quot;it was impossible for the accused to have committed the crime charged because, at the time of its commission, the accused was elsewhere&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

An alibi does not need to be proven, but rather it must simply raise a doubt.&lt;ref&gt;
Lizotte v. The King, 1950 CanLII 48 (S.C.C.), [1951] S.C.R. 115&lt;br&gt;

All alibi evidence must be disclosed to the crown.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Cleghorn, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 175&lt;/ref&gt; This is an exception to the rule of the right to remain silent. This is due to &quot;the ease with which alibi evidence may be fabricated; and the diversion of the alibi inquiry from the central inquiry at trial&quot;. &lt;Ref&gt;R v Noble [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874 &lt;/ref&gt;
Where the defence does not give enough notice and not sufficiently particularized for the police to investigate prior to trial, an adverse inference may be drawn from this.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Noble at 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Disclosure must be adequate and timely. If the disclosure does not satisfy these requirements, the trier of fact may draw an adverse inference when weighing the alibi evidence at trial.

The failure of the accused to testify on alibi may be used to draw an adverse inference about credibility of the defence.
The reason for this is that aibi evidence is &quot;not directly related to the guilt of the accused&quot; so the determination of the credibility of the alibi does not go to the ultimate issue of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;R v Noble at para 112&lt;/ref&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;==Background==--[[User:ContiR|ContiR]] ([[User talk:ContiR|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ContiR|contribs]]) 01:42, 7 May 2012 (UTC)
	
The post 9/11 airline budget cuts tested the moral fibers of the airline companies in the United States.  In fact, these financial constraints revealed the true colors of the 6 largest U.S. airlines; in the years following 9/11, the number of Enforcement Investigative Reports for the “big 6” dropped by 62% despite the number of commercial passengers increasing by 45%&lt;ref&gt;1http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale&lt;/ref&gt;. Clearly the airlines’ priority for sound planes was compromised as funds for passenger flight security increased. Financial constraints such as this led Northwest Airlines’ mechanics to go on strike on August 20th, 2005&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_06/b4070000689813.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Northwest Airlines did not let the strike restrict their business, within one day the airline had replaced the mechanics with substitute mechanics.  The skills of these Replacement engineers, however, were not up to par. The airline was conscious of their inadequacy; many had never worked on planes and were trained on simulators&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=423&lt;/ref&gt;.


This inadequacy eventually led Mark Lund, a Minnesota based Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector, to blow the whistle&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale&lt;/ref&gt;.  Just days after the replacement mechanics started, Lund noted several avoidable errors made due to the insufficient training of the new mechanics. The first several errors Lund noted were: 1) a DC-10 with a broken lavatory duct allowing waste products to spill onto critical equipment on a flight from Amsterdam to Minneapolis when Northwest Airlines planned to let the plan continue onto Honolulu before it was fixed until an FAA inspector interfered&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_06/b4070000689813.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, 2) a maintenance mechanic could not find a switch to test the engine on an airbus a320&lt;ref&gt;http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/09/08_zdechlikm_faafolo/&lt;/ref&gt;, 3) a mechanic was unsure of how to close a cabin door on a Boeing 757&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=423&lt;/ref&gt;, 4) a mechanic failed to lock the brakes on another Boeing 757 before checking the break wear pins&lt;ref&gt;http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/09/08_zdechlikm_faafolo/&lt;/ref&gt;, 5) a Boeing 757 blew out its main tires when it landed in Detroit the first morning after replacement mechanics took over&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale&lt;/ref&gt;.  

There were 121 other problems in the first week following the strike&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale&lt;/ref&gt;. Immediately after Lund began to notice these mistakes and the inadequacies of the replacement mechanics he wrote his FAA supervisors in Washington.  with 3 recommendations. He claimed that there was a situation that existed “that jeopardized lives”&lt;ref&gt;http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/09/08_zdechlikm_faafolo/&lt;/ref&gt; and made several suggestions that needed to be carried out until mechanics and inspectors could do their job “without error”. In his memo he recommended&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=423&lt;/ref&gt;:  1) cutting back flight schedules, 2) upgrading mechanic training program, and 3) increasing FAA surveillance. The FAA and Northwest Airlines had a cozy relationship, which led to immediate repercussions for Lund.  The FAA took away his badge and gave him a desk job[http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale 1]. Lund’s claims were verified in a 2010 investigation it was confirmed that Northwest Airlines violated more than 1,000 FAA directives &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.cnn.com/2010-07-22/us/northwest.airlines.faa_1_faa-inspectors-safety-directives-faa-airworthiness-directives?_s=PM:US&lt;/ref&gt;.


Lund, still concerned about the dangerous situation, fought back. He hand delivered his suggestions to the Senator of Minnesota (Northwest’s home state), Mark Dayton. Dayton was appalled by the behavior of the airline and the FAA. Dayton sent letter to inspector general at Department of Transportation (DOT), because the DOT oversees the FAA&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=423&lt;/ref&gt;. Dayton helped Lund get his job back within six weeks. Once he was back on the job, Lund immediately inspected the Boeing 757 whose breaks went out upon landing. He concluded that “probable cause for the tire failure was a brake failure caused by a brake control cable that a replacement mechanic inadvertently jammed after routine maintenance to an unrelated system”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=423&lt;/ref&gt;.  Lund immediately wrote a letter notifying his FAA supervisors again.  In his letter he cited this incident as an example and stated that Northwest “is not a school to train mechanics while it operates at a safety risk to the public”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;Procedural programming&lt;/b&gt; focuses on the step-by-step instructions that tell the computer what to do to solve a problem. This is the other most significant approach to programming, next to object-oriented programming (OOP). Procedural programming is based on procedure call which is locating specific tasks in procedures that are called by the main program code whenever a task needs to be completed. When it is done programming, the program control will return to the main program.


Procedures are small sections of program code that are called by the main program code when the tasks need to be performed. After a procedure finishes, the program control returns to the main program. 
	
By doing this approach, this allows each procedure to be performed as many times as needed without requiring unnecessary multiple copies of the same code. This makes the program smaller and the main program is easier to understand. With using this programming, it allows faster development time.

'''Structured programming''' is a type of programming that involves breaking the program into smaller modules of code. The modules have a duty of performing a single task, therefore eliminating the need to use the '''GOTO statement'''. The GOTO statement was very heavily used before procedural programming was created. It is basically a statement to send program control to a specific line of a code to complete commands at that specific point until another GOTO statement is reached. [[File:Cf-goto-fr.svg|100px|Cf-goto-fr]] 

In structured programming the overall general tasks that need to be performed first are of the highest priority and then the tasks get more and more specific as it goes on- the '''top-down''' philosophy. Sometimes structured programming and procedural programming are used interchangeably.

== Prepositions and Postpositions ==
A preposition links a noun to an action (e.g., “go ''from'' there”) or to another noun (“the pen ''on'' the table”). For the purpose of clarity, this chapter will divide Oromo prepositions into two categories: true prepositions and postpositions, with true prepositions coming before the noun and postpositions coming after the noun they relate to.
&lt;br/&gt;
'''Some Common Prepositions and Postpositions:'''
{|
|-
| &lt;u&gt;Postpositions&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Prepositions&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| '''ala''' &amp;mdash; out, outside || '''gara''' &amp;mdash; towards
|-
| '''bira''' &amp;mdash; beside, with, around || '''eega, erga''' &amp;mdash; since, from, after
|-
| '''booda''' &amp;mdash; after || '''haga, hanga''' &amp;mdash; until
|-
| '''cinaa''' &amp;mdash; beside, near, next to &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; || '''hamma''' &amp;mdash; up to, as much as
|-
| '''dur, dura''' &amp;mdash; before || '''akka''' &amp;mdash; like, as
|-
| '''duuba''' &amp;mdash; behind, back of || '''waa'ee''' &amp;mdash; about, in regard to
|-
| '''irra''' &amp;mdash; on
|-
| '''irraa''' &amp;mdash; from
|-
| '''itti''' &amp;mdash; to, at, in
|-
| '''jala''' &amp;mdash; under, beneath
|-
| '''jidduu''' &amp;mdash; middle, between
|-
| '''keessa''' &amp;mdash; in, inside
|-
| '''malee''' &amp;mdash; without, except
|-
| '''wajjin''' &amp;mdash; with, together
|-
| '''gubbaa''' &amp;mdash; on, above
|-
| '''fuuldura''' &amp;mdash; in front of
|-
| '''gad(i)''' &amp;mdash; down, below
|-
| '''ol(i)''' &amp;mdash; up, above
|}

&lt;br/&gt;
Examples: &lt;br/&gt;
'''boqonnaarra [boqonnaa irra]''' – “on vacation” &lt;br/&gt;
'''mana keessa''' – “in the house” &lt;br/&gt;
'''waaree booda''' – “afternoon” &lt;br/&gt;
'''irra deebi'i''' – “repeat” [lit. “return on it”] &lt;br/&gt;
'''Yuunivarsitii Haroomayaatti barsiissaa''' – “teacher at Haromaya University” &lt;br/&gt;
'''mana nyaataa kanatti''' – “at this restaurant” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''waa'ee fiilmii sun natti himi'''” – “tell me about that film” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Chaaltuun akka Hawwiituu baratuu dha'''.” – “Chaltu is a student like Hawitu.” &lt;br/&gt;
'''hanga torban dhufu''' – “until next week” &lt;br/&gt;
'''gammachuu wajjin''' – “with pleasure” &lt;br/&gt;
'''shaayee annan malee''' – “tea without milk” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Ani meetirii lama gadi'''.” – “I am below [shorter than] 2 meters.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Keeniyaan Itoophiyaarraa (gara) kibbatti argamti'''” – “Kenya is located (to the) south of Ethiopia” &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
From the examples above, you may notice that the postpositions '''itti''', '''irra''', and '''irraa''' most often occur as suffixes, -''tti'', -''rra'', and -''rraa'', on the nouns they relate to.

Often with place names, no preposition or postposition is used to be mean “in”. Therefore, one can say “'''Finfinnee jiratta'''” for “you live in Finfinnee [Addis Ababa]”, or “'''hospitaalan ture'''” for “I was in the hospital”, using no preposition.

Personal pronouns are not used with prepositions. Instead, possessive pronouns are used as personal pronouns.

Examples:&lt;br/&gt;
“toward me” &amp;mdash; '''gara koo'''('''tti''') [not '''gara na''']&lt;br/&gt;
“like us” &amp;mdash; '''akka keenya'''&lt;br/&gt;
“according to him” &amp;mdash; '''akka isaatti'''&lt;br/&gt;
“about you” &amp;mdash; '''waa'ee kee'''&lt;br/&gt;

Postpositions, on the other hand, take the accusative form of personal pronouns.

Examples:&lt;br/&gt;
“at you” &amp;mdash; '''sitti'''&lt;br/&gt;
“from me” &amp;mdash; '''narraa'''&lt;br/&gt;
“under him” &amp;mdash; '''isa jala'''&lt;br/&gt;

When an adjective modifies a noun, the postposition follows the adjective, as in “'''nama guddarraa'''” (“from the big man”).




== Conjunctions ==
Whereas prepositions link nouns to other parts of the sentence, conjunctions usually link more complete thoughts together.

'''Some Common Conjunctions:'''
{|
|-
| and || '''fi''' [also -''f'' suffix]
|-
| but || '''garuu, immoo'''
|-
| or || '''yookin''' (for declaratives), '''moo''' (for questions)
|-
| however || '''haa ta'u malee'''
|-
| though || '''ta'us'''
|-
| so, therefore || '''kanaaf, kanaafu'''
|-
| because || '''sababiin isaa, sababiinsa''' [lit. “its reason”]
|-
| so that, in order to &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; || '''akka'''
|}

Conjunctions come between the two clauses they connect, though '''garuu''' and '''immoo''' (“but”) can also  come after the first noun or nounal phrase in the second clause.

Examples:&lt;br/&gt;
“'''Inni shee jaalata ta'us amanamaa miti'''.” – “Though he loves her, he is unfaithful.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Daadhii moo biiraa dhuguu barbaadda'''?” – “Do you want tej [alcoholic honey drink] or beer?” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Ani kochee nyaadhe kanaafu gara kasan qaba'''.” – “I ate kitfo [raw meat] so I got diarrhea.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Nyaatan barbaada sababiinsa nan beela'e'''.” – “I want food because I am hungry.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Ani nan deema akka inni dhufuuf'''.” – “I will go so that he will come.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Ittoo shiroon jaaladha garuu ittoo misira caalaa jaaladha'''.” or “'''Ittoo shiroon jaaladha ittoo misira garuu caalaa jaaladha'''.” – “I like shiro watt, but I like lentil watt more.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Innis gara biyya isaa dhufe, sabni isaa garuu isa hin simanne'''.” – “And he came to his country, but his people did not accept him [John 1:11].”

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Delete a row in Repeating Groups ==

Since OpenClinica 3.1 it isn't possible to delete entries/rows from a Repeating Group once it was saved. The following cite is from the OpenClinica User mailinglist&lt;ref&gt;https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2011-December/006321.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Once data has been entered in a repeating group, the row can never be removed from the UI. 
The user must physically remove the values from each of the fields in the repeating group, and provide a reason 
for change if that configuration is set for the study.

Based on user feedback with the previous implementation of repeating groups and reason for change we believed 
this would be the best course of action. In the future, we might allow the X button again but put a simple 
strike-through the row rather than hiding it from view like we did in versions 3.0.x and earlier.&lt;/source&gt;

(2012-04-12) More detail on this change and the rationale for it has recently been added to the [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/openclinica-user-guide/submit-data-module-overview/enter-data-event-completing-crfs#content-title-5239 'Entering Data for an Event Into CRFs'] chapter of the user guide.

In this chapter, we will introduce the important &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; type class.

== Motivation ==

In [[../Other data structures|Other data structures]], we saw operations that apply to all elements of some grouped value. The prime example is &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; which works on lists. Another example we worked through was the following Tree datatype:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show)
&lt;/source&gt;

The map function we wrote for Tree was: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
treeMap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree b
treeMap f (Leaf x) = Leaf (f x)
treeMap f (Branch left right) = Branch (treeMap f left) (treeMap f right)
&lt;/source&gt;

As discussed before, we can conceivably define a map-style function for any arbitrary data structure.

When we first introduced &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; in [[../More about lists|More about lists]], we went through the process of taking a very specific function for list elements and generalizing to show how &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; combines any appropriate function with all sorts of lists. Now, we will generalize still ''further''. Instead of map-for-lists and map-for-trees and other distinct maps, how about a general concept of maps for all sorts of mappable types?

== Introducing &lt;tt&gt;Functor&lt;/tt&gt; ==

&lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; is a Prelude class for types which can be mapped over. It has a single method, called &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;. The class is defined as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
class  Functor f  where
    fmap        :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
&lt;/source&gt;

The usage of the type variable &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; can look a little strange at first. Here, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is a parametrized data type; in the signature of &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; takes &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as a type parameter in one of its appearances and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; in the other. Let's consider an instance of &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;By replacing &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; we get the following signature for &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fmap        :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b
&lt;/source&gt;

... which fits the natural definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance  Functor Maybe  where
    fmap f Nothing    =  Nothing
    fmap f (Just x)   =  Just (f x)
&lt;/source&gt;

(Incidentally, this definition is in Prelude; so, we didn't really need to have implemented &lt;code&gt;maybeMap&lt;/code&gt; for that example in the &quot;Other data structures&quot; chapter.)

The &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; instance for lists (also in Prelude) is simple:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance  Functor []  where
    fmap = map
&lt;/source&gt;

... and if we replace &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; signature, we get the familiar type of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;.

So, &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; is a generalization of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; for any parametrized data type.&lt;ref&gt;Data structures provide the most intuitive examples; however, there are functors which cannot reasonably be seen as data structures. A commonplace metaphor consists in thinking of functors as containers; like all metaphors, however, it can be stretched only so far.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturally, we can provide &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; instances for our own data types. In particular, &lt;code&gt;treeMap&lt;/code&gt; can be promptly relocated to an instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Functor Tree where
    fmap f (Leaf x) = Leaf (f x)
    fmap f (Branch left right) = Branch (fmap f left) (fmap f right)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;!--Here there could be a digression about Data.Foldable and the catamorphisms in Other data structures. I fear it would grow too long and winding, though--&gt;

Here's a quick demo of &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; in action with the instances above (to reproduce it, you only need to load the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;instance&lt;/code&gt; declarations for &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;; the others are already in Prelude):

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; fmap (2*) [1,2,3,4]
[2,4,6,8]
*Main&gt; fmap (2*) (Just 1)
Just 2
*Main&gt; fmap (fmap (2*)) [Just 1, Just 2, Just 3, Nothing]
[Just 2, Just 4, Just 6, Nothing]
*Main&gt; fmap (2*) (Branch (Branch (Leaf 1) (Leaf 2)) (Branch (Leaf 3) (Leaf 4)))
Branch (Branch (Leaf 2) (Leaf 4)) (Branch (Leaf 6) (Leaf 8))
}}

{{body note|1=
Beyond the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; examples mentioned here, Prelude provides a number of other handy &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; instances. The full list can be found in GHC's documentation for the {{Haskell lib|v=latest|Control|Monad}} module.
}}

=== The functor laws ===

When providing a new instance of &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;, you should ensure it satisfies the two functor laws. There is nothing mysterious about these laws; their role is to guarantee &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; behaves sanely and actually performs a mapping operation (as opposed to some other nonsense).&lt;ref&gt;The functor laws, and indeed the concept of a functor, are grounded on a branch of Mathematics called ''Category Theory'' which should not be a concern for you at this point. We will have opportunities to explore related topics in the Advanced Track of this book.&lt;/ref&gt; The first law is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fmap id  ==  id
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is the identity function, which returns its argument unaltered. The first law states that mapping &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; over a functor must return the functor unchanged.

Next, the second law:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fmap (f . g)  ==  fmap f . fmap g
&lt;/source&gt;

It states that it should not matter whether we map a composed function or first map one function and then the other (assuming the application order remains the same in both cases).

== What did we gain? ==

At this point, we can ask what benefit we get from the extra layer of generalization brought by the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; class. There are two significant advantages:

* The availability of the &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; method relieves us from having to recall, read, and write a plethora of differently named mapping methods (&lt;code&gt;maybeMap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;treeMap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;weirdMap&lt;/code&gt;, ''ad infinitum''). As a consequence, code becomes both cleaner and easier to understand. On spotting a use of &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;, we instantly have a general idea of what is going on.&lt;ref&gt;This is analogous to the gain in clarity provided by replacing explicit recursive algorithms on lists with implementations based on higher-order functions.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Using the type class system, we can write &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;-based algorithms which work out of the box with ''any'' functor - be it &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; or whichever you need. Indeed, a number of useful classes in the hierarchical libraries inherit from &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Note for the curious'': For one example, have a peek at [[../Applicative Functors|Applicative Functors]] in the Advanced Track (for the moment you can ignore the references to monads there).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Type classes make it possible to create general solutions to whole categories of problems. Depending on what you use Haskell for, you may not need to define new classes often, but you will certainly be ''using'' type classes all the time. Many of the most powerful features and sophisticated capabilities of Haskell rely on type classes (residing either in the standard libraries or elsewhere). From this point on, classes will be a prominent presence in our studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Examples ==
The analysis presented in this section is valid when the length an object analysis, say ''L'', is much larger than other dimensions and when the applied load is in the direction of ''L''. An example of such a case is a pin jointed truss. When a load is applied to a truss its members carry  compressive (or tensile) load acting such as to shorten (or increase) the length or tensile load.

Let us consider a bar of length L, cross sectional area ''A'' and an elastic modulus ''E''. It is fixed on one of its end and is acted upon a force ''P'' along its length.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;'''Content Management Systems'''&lt;/u&gt;

''Content Management Systems (CMSs)'' are document management systems that can include images, multimedia files and other content in addition to conventional documents. Content Management Systems can include, but are not limited to, ''Document Management'' ''Systems'' ''(DMSs)'' and ''Enterprise Content Management Systems (ECMs).''

Document management, often referred to as ''Document Management Systems (DMS),'' is the use of a computer system and software to store, manage and track electronic documents and electronic images of paper based information captured through the use of a document scanner. The term document is defined as &quot;recorded information or an object which can be treated as a unit&quot;. DM systems allow documents to be modified and managed but typically lack the records retention and disposition functionality for managing records. 

Document management, while still recognized and utilized independently, it is also a common component found within an Enterprise Content Management environment. According to Wikipedia, &quot;''Enterprise Content Management (ECM)'' is a formalized means of organizing and storing an organization's documents, and other content, that relate to the organization's processes. The term encompasses strategies, methods, and tools used throughout the lifecycle of the content&quot;.

The website, AIIM.org, refers to Enterprise Content Management (ECM) as, &quot; the strategies, methods and tools used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes. ECM tools and strategies allow the management of an organization's unstructured information, wherever that information exists.

As of 2012, the ''Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM)'' gives some examples of unstructured information and examples of their classifications and how they might be organized using a content management system.
Below are examples found on their website AIIM.org:

'''''Content and Documents'''''

Unstructured content enters an organization's IT infrastructure from a variety of sources. Regardless of how a piece of content enters, it has a lifecycle. Follow a document through its lifecycle as viewed through the use of ECM technology.
1.Electronic Unstructured Data: email, instant message, text document, spreadsheet, etc. 
2.Electronic Forms 
3.Paper Documents/Forms 

'''Scanning''' 

Paper generally enters the organization through a scanner, or sometimes, a multifunction device. In centralized scan operations, large volumes of paper are put into the system by dedicated workers. In distributed operations, smaller volumes of documents are captured with lower volume scanners or multifunction devices closer to their point of creation.

'''Document Imaging''' 

Software captures the image of the paper document. Increasingly, electronic document images have the same legal status as a paper document.

'''Forms Processing'''

Business forms are ingested into the system. Most forms today are &quot;structured&quot;-the location of the form elements are known. The ability to process unstructured forms, those without a pre-defined form template, is improving.

'''Recognition'''

Technologies that allow paper information to be translated to electronic data without manual data input. Recognition technologies have progressive capabilities from optical character recognition (OCR) to intelligent character recognitions (ICR) and are important for converting large amounts of forms or unstructured data to usable information in a content management system.

'''Categorization/Taxonomy''' 

A taxonomy provides a formal structure for information, based on the individual needs of a business. Categorization tools automate the placement of content (document images, email, text documents, i.e., all electronic content) for future retrieval based on the taxonomy. Users can also manually categorize documents. Critical step to ensure that content is properly stored.

'''Indexing'''

An essential part of the capture process, creates metadata from scanned documents (customer ID number, for example) so the document can be found. Indexing can be based on keywords or full-text.

'''Document Management'''

Document management technology helps organizations better manage the creation, revision, approval, and consumption of electronic documents. It provides key features such as library services, document profiling, searching, check-in, check-out, version control, revision history, and document security.

'''Records Management''' 

Content of long-term business value are deemed records and managed according to a retention schedule that determines how long a record is kept based on either outside regulations or internal business practices. Any piece of content can be designated a record.

'''Email Management''' 

As the de facto standard for business communication, removing emails from the server and saving them to a repository isn't enough. Email must be classified, stored, and destroyed consistent with business standards-just as any other document or record.

'''Web Content Management''' 

Web content management technology addresses the content creation, review, approval, and publishing processes of Web-based content. Key features include creation and authoring tools or integrations, input and presentation template design and management, content re-use management, and dynamic publishing capabilities.

'''Digital Asset Management''' 

Similar in functionality to document management, DAM is focused on the storage, tracking, and use of rich media documents (video, logos, photographs, xrays, sonograms,etc.). Roots of the technology are in the media and entertainment industry, currently experiencing growth, especially in marketing departments. Digital assets typically have high intellectual property values.

[[File:CeBIT_2006_Chi_Mei_Optoelectronics_56LCD_QuadHDTV_digital_radiography_Digitalroentgen_by_HDTVTotalDOTcom.jpg|100px|thumb|Digital Radiography]]Digital radiology may represent the greatest technological advancement in medical imaging over the last decade. The use of radiographic films in x ray imaging might become obsolete in a few years. Images can be immediately acquired, deleted, modified, and subsequently sent to a network of computers. The referring physician can view the requested image on a desktop or a personal computer and often report in just a few minutes after the examination was performed. The images are no longer held in a single location; but can be seen simultaneously by physicians who are miles apart. In addition, the patient can have the x ray images on a compact disk to take to another physician or hospital.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The framing effect is a cognitive bias in which diverging results tend to be produced from the same choice problem when being described differently.&lt;ref&gt;Bourgeois-Gironde, Sacha, and Raphael Giraud. &quot;Accounting for Framing Effects: an Informational Approach to Intensionality in the Bolker-Jeffrey Decision Model.&quot; (2005): n. page. Web. 4 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

In their study, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman propose an example to illustrate this.  They provide a problem, and two different sets of choices.&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, Amos, and David Kahneman. &quot;The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice.&quot; Science. 211.4481 (1981): 453-458. Web. 4 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Survey Question'''
The United States is preparing for an outbreak of a disease expected to kill 600 people.  There are two programs set forth to combat this disease. Pick one.

'''Scenario 1'''
Given this question, two choices were made available to the study group.  In choice A, 200 people will live.  In choice B there is a 1 in 3 chance that everyone will live, and a 2 in 3 chance that nobody will live.

Under these choices, most people were risk averse, and chose A to save 200 people no matter what. 72% chose A, while 28% chose B

'''Scenario 2'''
For a second study group, the same question was presented, but with differently worded questions.  In choice C, 400 people will die.  In choice D, there is a 1 in 3 chance that nobody will die, and a 2 in 3 probability that 600 people will die.

Under this second set of choices, most people acted as risk takers; they would rather take the chance on everyone living than on 400 people dying for sure. 78% chose D (equivalent of B), while 22% chose C (equivalent of A).

==Results==
In reality, each one of these four choices leads to the same expected outcome, so risk neutrality would suggest that there is no difference between which one is chosen.&lt;ref name=Dalton&gt;Dalton, Thomas. Complexity, Institutions and Economic Activity. 2nd. Dubuque, IA: Kendall Hunt, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Choices A and C are identical, as are choices B and D. The way in which these questions are presented to an individual greatly affects the decision making process.  This shows a weakness in the ability of individuals to make rational decisions.  The Tversky and Kahneman study shows that individuals are risk seeking when the choice is between a certain loss and a potential larger loss, and individuals are risk averting when faced with deciding between a certain gain and a potential larger gain.&lt;ref name=Dalton /&gt;

==Significance==
The use of framing effects can have significant implications on society in many ways.  The way something is framed has been shown to alter expected utility.  The Expected Utility Theory has four assumptions, one of them being invariance, which states that differing representations of the same choice problem should not affect choice.&lt;ref name=Druckman&gt;Druckman, James. &quot;Using Credible Advice to Overcome Framing Effects.&quot; Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization. 17.1 62-82. Print. &lt;/ref&gt;  This broadly affects society in that any question can be presented in a way that encourages answers to the surveyor's preference. An example of this is that people are more likely to support an economic policy resulting in 90% employment rather than one that results in 10% unemployment. &lt;ref name=Druckman /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fair Use''' is the doctrine in American copyright law pertaining to the utilization of copyrighted works without the supposed necessity of economic reimbursement or artistic license.  Because the application of this doctrine to cases of copyright infringement and utilization has rendered an exact definition of the doctrine elusive, law has been unable to reflect a statutory definition.  The doctrine was finally recognized by statute in the Copyright Act of 1976, which was part of a greater general revision of American copyright laws.

== Fair Use According to Copyright Law ==
§107 in Title 17 of the United States Code consists of the fair use doctrine as recognized by statute:

''Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—
(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work.
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if
such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{C sharp/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Casting ==

Casting is a way to convert values from one type to another. Mainly, two types of casting exist:

===Implicit casting===

Implicit casting is the way values are cast automatically by the compiler. This happens if and only if no loss of information occurs. Examples can be seen when converting data from smaller integral types to larger types, or derived types to the base type.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
int iValue = 4711;

double dDistance = iValue ;

public class Animal { […] };

public class Mammal : Animal { […] };

public class Cat : Mammal
{
    […]
}

Mammal mammal = new Cat();
&lt;/source&gt;

===Explicit casting===

This type of casting has to be specified by the developer, as a loss of data is possible.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
double dPi = 3.1415926535;

int iValue = (int)dPi;   // iValue = 3
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Trafficking in substance'''&lt;br&gt;
5. (1) No person shall traffic in a substance included in Schedule I, II, III or IV or in any substance represented or held out by that person to be such a substance.
&lt;br&gt;
(2) No person shall, for the purpose of trafficking, possess a substance included in Schedule I, II, III or IV.

'''Punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2)

...&lt;br&gt;
'''Punishment in respect of specified substance'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2), where the subject-matter of the offence is a substance included in Schedule II in an amount that does not exceed the amount set out for that substance in Schedule VII, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years less a day.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) where the subject-matter of the offence is a substance included in Schedule II in an amount that does not exceed the amount set out for that substance in Schedule VIII is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Interpretation'''&lt;br&gt;
(6) For the purposes of subsection (4) and Schedule VII, the amount of the substance means the entire amount of any mixture or substance, or the whole of any plant, that contains a detectable amount of the substance.
&lt;br&gt;

Schedule VII sets cannabis resin and cannabis marijuana at 3kg.

Schedule VIII sets the cannabis resin at 1 g and cannabis marijuana at 30 g.

==Schedule II: Marijuana, Hash, etc.==
:''For principles on Drug Offences Generally, see [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offences/Drug Offences|Drug Offences]]''

Offenders found trafficking in a Schedule II controlled substance (e.g. Cannabinoids) in an amount greater than 3kg are liable for an indictable offence with a maximum penalty of life in jail. Where the amount is equal or less than 3kg, the offender is liable for an indictable offence with a maximum penalty of 5 years jail.

The primary sentencing principles for these offences involving soft drugs are protection of the public through denunciation and deterrence.
&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Butt, (2007), 265 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 98 (N.L.S.C.)
R. v. Murray, [http://canlii.ca/t/frn0m 2012 ABPC 123] at 92
&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts do recognize a distinction between hard and soft drugs, where soft drugs are treated less seriously from hard drugs.

Trafficking in cannabis is typically a sentence of incarceration.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Butt and Gallant 1993 CanLII 7743 (NL CA), (1993), 106 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 92 (N.L.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
There has been a benchmark set by some courts of 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McKie (1981), 29 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 181 (P.E.I.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper range of marijuana trafficking is typically 12 months jail and above.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Chen, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2007/2007onca230/2007onca230.html 2007 ONCA 230] (18 months jail)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nguyen (2007), 227 C.C.C. (6th) 356 (C.A.) (15 months )&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid range of sentence is around 12 months on a conditional sentence order.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Imoro, [20011] O.J. No. 996 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nagtzaam, [2009] O.J. No. 5409 (O.C.J.)
&lt;/ref&gt; Though will be actual jail in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Do, [2002] O.J. No. 5491 (O.C.J.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower end of the range is around 6 months jail, served either conditionally or on a straight-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Schweitzer, [2000] O.J. No. 5228 (O.C.J.) (5 months jail)&lt;br&gt;
 R. v. Stover, [2004] O.J. No. 3736 (O.C.J.) (4 months CSO)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

At the very lowest end there will be the rare granting of suspended sentences, fines, or discharges.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Small [http://canlii.ca/en/bc/bcca/doc/2001/2001bcca91/2001bcca91.html 2001 BCCA 91]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lucas, [2002] B.C.J. No. 1631 (Prov. Ct.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/reF&gt; This usually involves exceptional circumstances such as the offenders position in the community or a benevolent intent behind the act.

Alberta does not have a starting point for sentence on soft drugs. However, the norm is for a sentence of incarceration regardless of prior record with a range between 6 and 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Murray, [http://canlii.ca/t/frn0m 2012 ABPC 123]  at para. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attempt to commit murder'''&lt;br&gt;
239. (1) Every person who attempts by any means to commit murder is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
:(a) if a restricted firearm or prohibited firearm is used in the commission of the offence or if any firearm is used in the commission of the offence and the offence is committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal organization, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of
::(i) in the case of a first offence, five years, and
::(ii) in the case of a second or subsequent offence, seven years;
:(a.1) in any other case where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years; and
:(b) in any other case, to imprisonment for life.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Subsequent offences'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) In determining, for the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), whether a convicted person has committed a second or subsequent offence, if the person was earlier convicted of any of the following offences, that offence is to be considered as an earlier offence:
:(a) an offence under this section;
:(b) an offence under subsection 85(1) or (2) or section 244 or 244.2; or
:(c) an offence under section 220, 236, 272 or 273, subsection 279(1) or section 279.1, 344 or 346 if a firearm was used in the commission of the offence. However, an earlier offence shall not be taken into account if 10 years have elapsed between the day on which the person was convicted of the earlier offence and the day on which the person was convicted of the offence for which sentence is being imposed, not taking into account any time in custody.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Sequence of convictions only'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the only question to be considered is the sequence of convictions and no consideration shall be given to the sequence of commission of offences or whether any offence occurred before or after any conviction.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec239 CCC]
}}

==Proof of the Offence==
In addition to the essential elements of time, location, and identity, the prosecution should prove:
# the manner in which the attempt occurred
# injuries, if any, to the victim
# there was no consent 
# there was no provocation 
# there was an intent to kill

==Interpretation==


The ''mens rea'' required for attempted murder is that there must be a specific &quot;intent to kill&quot;, not simply an intention to harm with consequences that could have led to death. Nor is it enough that he knows his actions are likely to cause death or was reckless to the possible consequences. There must be subjective foresight of the consequences of the accused's conduct.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Logan, Logan and Johnson, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 731&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Reeves, 2012 BCCA 98 (CanLII) at para. 10 (&quot;The Crown must prove the accused acted with subjective foresight of the consequences of his conduct. Objective foresight of the consequences will not suffice.&quot;)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Life threatening wounds alone is not sufficient evidence of an intent to kill. There must be evidence from which the trier of fact may infer that the accused intended something more than the actual or natural consequence of his wounding act.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Roberts, [http://www.canlii.org/en/sk/skqb/doc/2006/2006skqb441/2006skqb441.html 2006 SKQB 441] at para. 8 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Ross, [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2003/2003mbca70/2003mbca70.html 2003 MBCA 70] conviction overturned&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, some wounds provide evidence of intent to kill. For example, a shot is to the head may be evidence of intent to kill. It is a question of degree having regard to all of the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crown must prove a specific ''intent to kill'' at the time of the actions. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. J.M. (1995), 134 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 161 (NFPC) acquitted because accused changed her mind&lt;/ref&gt; Anything less would amount to a violation of section 7 of the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225 (SCC) &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Logan, [1990] S.C.J. No. 89 (SCC)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''intent to kill'' is often established by way of utterances of the accused of their desire to cause death.&lt;ref&gt;
for example:&lt;br&gt;
R. v. A.D.Y. (1992), 11 B.C.A.C. 154 (CA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

When deliberating on consent, a jury can be instructed to rely on the common sense inference that &quot;a person usually knows what the predictable consequences of his or her actions are, and means to bring them about&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Walle, 2012 SCC 41 (CanLII) at para. 64 per Moldaver J.&lt;/ref&gt;

:(c) an offence under section 220, 236, 272 or 273, subsection 279(1) or section 279.1, 344 or 346 if a firearm was used in the commission of the offence.
&lt;p&gt;
However, an earlier offence shall not be taken into account if 10 years have elapsed between the day on which the person was convicted of the earlier offence and the day on which the person was convicted of the offence for which sentence is being imposed, not taking into account any time in custody.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Sequence of convictions only'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the only question to be considered is the sequence of convictions and no consideration shall be given to the sequence of commission of offences or whether any offence occurred before or after any conviction.

== Cyclic groups ==

In the previous section about subgroups we saw that if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a group with &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, then the set of powers of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle = \{g^n\mid n\in\mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt; constituted a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''cyclic subgroup generated by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;''. In this, section, we will generalize this concept, and in the process, obtain an important family of groups which is very rich in structure.

'''Definition 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group with an element &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle = G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''cyclic'' group, and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''generator'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''generate'' &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. If there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g^n=e&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest positive such integer, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt;, the cyclic group of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. If no such integer exists, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;C_\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the infinite cyclic group.


The infinite cyclic group can also be denoted &lt;math&gt;F_{\{g\}}&lt;/math&gt;, the ''free group'' with one generator. This is foreshadowing for a future section and can be ignored for now.


'''Theorem 2:''' Any cyclic group is abelian.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a cyclic group with generator &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;h,k\in G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;h=g^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=g^m&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n,m\in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. To show commutativity, observe that &lt;math&gt;hk=g^ng^m=g^{n+m}=g^{m+n}=g^mg^n=kh&lt;/math&gt; and we are done. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 3:''' Any subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a cyclic group with generator &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;H\leq G&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;G=\langle g \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, in paticular every element of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;g^n&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. We claim that if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; the lowest positive integer such that &lt;math&gt;g^a\in H&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;H=\langle g^a \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. To see this, let &lt;math&gt;g^n\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;n=qa+r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0\leq r &lt; a&lt;/math&gt; for unique &lt;math&gt;q,r\in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup and &lt;math&gt;g^a\in H&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;g^n (g^a)^{-q}=g^{qa+r}g^{-qa}=g^r\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Now, assume that &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;g^r\in H&lt;/math&gt; contradicts our assumption that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the least positive integer such that &lt;math&gt;g^a\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, &lt;math&gt;g^n\in H&lt;/math&gt; only if &lt;math&gt;n=qa&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;H=\langle g^a \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and is cyclic, as was to be shown. {{Unicode|∎}}

As the alert reader will have noticed, the preceeding proof invoked the notion of ''division with remainder'' which should be familiar from number theory. Our treatment of cyclic groups will have close ties with notions from number theory. This is no coincidence, as the next few statements will show. Indeed, an alternative title for this section could have been &quot;Modular arithmetic and integer ideals&quot;. The notion of an ''ideal'' may not yet be familiar to the reader, who is asked to wait patiently until the chapter about rings.


'''Theorem 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n=\{0,1,2,...,n-1\}&lt;/math&gt; with addition defined modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. That is &lt;math&gt;a+b\equiv r \,\mathrm{mod}\,n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a+b=qn+r&lt;/math&gt;. We denote this operation by &lt;math&gt;a+_nb=r&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_n,+_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a cyclic group.

''Proof'': We must first show that &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_n,+_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a group, then find a generator. We verify the group axioms. Associativity is inherited from the integers. The element &lt;math&gt;0\in Z_n&lt;/math&gt; is an identity element with respect to &lt;math&gt;+_n&lt;/math&gt;. An inverse of &lt;math&gt;a\in Z_n&lt;/math&gt; is an element &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a +_n b=0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;b+a|n&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;b\equiv n-a \equiv -a \,\mathrm{mod}\,n&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;b=n-a=-a&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_n,+_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a group. Now, since &lt;math&gt;a=a\cdot 1 = \underbrace{1+...+1}_{a\,\mathrm{terms}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; generates &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_n,+_n)&lt;/math&gt; is cyclic. {{Unicode|∎}}

Unless we explicitly state otherwise, by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; we  will always refer to the cyclic group &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_n,+_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the argument for the generator of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; can be made valid for any integer &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, this shows that also &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is cyclic with the generator &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 5:''' An element &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is a generator if and only if &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We will need the following theorem from number theory: If &lt;math&gt;m,n&lt;/math&gt; are integers, then there exists integers &lt;math&gt;r,s&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;rm+sn=1&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if &lt;math&gt;\gcd(m,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;. We will not prove this here. A proof can be found in the number theory section.

For the right implication, assume that &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle = \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then for all &lt;math&gt;b\in \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b\equiv pa \,\mathrm{mod}\, n&lt;/math&gt; for some integer &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. In paticular, there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;sa\equiv 1 \,\mathrm{mod}\,n&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that there exists another integer &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;sa-rn=1&lt;/math&gt;. By the above-mentioned theorem from number theory, we then have &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;. For the left implication, assume &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists integers &lt;math&gt;s,r&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;sa-rn=1 \,\Rightarrow\, sa\equiv 1 \,\mathrm{mod}\,n&lt;/math&gt;, implying that &lt;math&gt;sa=1&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; generates &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;, it must be true that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is also a generator, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


We can generalize Theorem 5 a bit by looking at the orders of the elements in cyclic groups.


'''Theorem 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;H=\langle g \rangle \leq \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;|H|=|a|=\frac{n}{\gcd(a,n)}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Recall that the order of &lt;math&gt;a\in \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the lowest positive integer &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ra=0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is cyclic, there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ra=sn&lt;/math&gt; is minimal and positive. This is the definition of the least common multiple; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(a,n)=ra=|a|a&lt;/math&gt;. Recall from number theory that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(a,n)\cdot \gcd(a,n)=an&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;|a|=\frac{\mathrm{lcm}(a,n)}{a}=\frac{an}{a\cdot \gcd(a,n)}=\frac{n}{\gcd(a,n)}&lt;/math&gt;, as was to be proven. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 7:''' Every subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}=\{na\mid a\in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': The fact that any subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is cyclic follows from Theorem 3. Therefore, let &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; generate &lt;math&gt;H\leq G&lt;/math&gt;. Then we see immediately that &lt;math&gt;H=n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 8:''' Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; be fixed, and let &lt;math&gt;H=\{ra+sb|r,s\in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We msut first show that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup. This is immediate since &lt;math&gt;(ra+sb)-(r^\prime a + s^\prime b) = (r-r^\prime)a+(s-s^\prime)b\in H&lt;/math&gt;. From the proof of Theorem 3, we see that any subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is generated by its lowest positive element. It is a theorem of number theory that the lowest positive integer &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d=ra+sb&lt;/math&gt; for fixed integers &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r,s\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; equals the greatest common divisor of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; generates &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 9:''' Let &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; be subgroups of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}\cap m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the subgroup generated by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(n,m)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': The fact that &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}\cap m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup is obvious since &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; are subgroups. To find a generator of &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}\cap m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, we must find its lowest positive element. That is, the lowest positive integer &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is both a multiple of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. This is the definition of the least common multiple of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(n,m)&lt;/math&gt;, and the result follows. {{Unicode|∎}}


It should be obvious by now that &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C_\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; are the ''same groups''. This will be made precise in a later section but can be visualized by denoting any generator of &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C_\infty&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

We will have more to say about cyclic groups later, when we have more tools at our disposal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is a broad term to describe creating and managing an application throughout its entire life cycle, from design through coding and testing to maintenance and eventually to retirement. ALM software typically has several integrated components that work together for a variety of tasks, such as those that take place during the system design and program development process, and are designed to automate, manage, and simplify the program development process. Many ALM programs include program design tools such as, those used to create data flow diagrams, structure charts, and other tools and the ability to generate the program code from the finished design to create the application.

==Optionally Included Tools==

===Requirements Management===
:Requirement management is the process of tracking and managing requirement definitions as they are created and modified through the development process.  This process is crucial to avoiding costly mistakes and to provide a finished product meets the requirements set forth at the start of the project.

===Configuration Management===
:Configuration management refers to the broad scope of tracking the entire program development process.  Several aspects that are tracked include all components used in the final program, revisions, backups of versions during the process and final, and security and control.  Tracking these events allows only authorized users to alter the program and to never lose progress with the backups.

===Issue Tracking===
:Issue tracking is the process of recording bugs, assigning them to personnel to fix them, and then tracking their status along that process.  This process persists after the finish product is released and other issues are identified during use.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Deborah and Parker, Charles S. &quot;Understanding Computers Today and Tomorrow 13th Edition&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:FaultTrack FreeEdition.png|thumb|Issue Tracking Software]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">An entity is something of importance to a business or organization. When the entity is something an organization or business wants to store, it becomes a database table. There are three different relationships between entities. The first is one-to-one entity relationships. This exists when one entity is related to only one other entity of a particular type. For example, a business has multiple stores, each store location has a single manager, the relationship between store and manager is 1:1. The second relationship is one-to-many entity relationship. These are the most common relationships and exist when one entity can be related to more than one other entity. For example, if a supplier supplies more than one product to the company, the relationship between the supplier and the products is O:M. The last relationship is many-to-many entity relationship. This relationship exists when one entity can be related to multiple entities of the same type of the original entity. For example, if an order can contain multiple products and one product can appear on many orders, the relationship between orders and products is M:M.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bits ==

In a digital circuit, the smallest unit of data is the '''bit''', which derives its name from the phrase '''binary digit'''. Any single bit can only exist in one of two possible states. These states are most often represented as either '''one (1)''' or '''zero (0)'''. Other possible representations used are true and false, or off and on, but one and zero are the most common ways to represent the data a bit holds.

In a physical digital circuit, ones and zeros are represented by high and low voltages, respectively. Reasonable voltages within a digital circuit might be 5 volts representing a 1 and zero volts representing a 0. The realities of digital circuits are a bit more complicated than this, but for now this will serve as an adequate abstraction. Understanding how to handle digital information does not require a complete knowledge of how the underlying circuits work.

== Bytes ==

A single bit has limited use, since it can only represent two states. To overcome this limitation, digital circuit designers use groups of bits to represent data more complex than 1 and 0. If you group two bits together, each bit can take on a 1 or 0 value independent of the other bit. This means that the two bits together can represent four different states, 00, 01, 10 and 11. As you group more bits together you can represent a larger number of states. Three bits can represent eight states and four bits can represent sixteen states. If you have a group of ''n'' bits, that group of bits can represent 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; different states.

Early computers used groups of bits of various different sizes, but eventually industry practice converged on the use of groupings of eight bits. Today, a group of eight bits is known as a '''byte'''. The term &quot;byte&quot; is a respelling of the word &quot;bite,&quot; in order to avoid the problem of a typo causing the two words to be mistaken for one another. If you have ever heard of an eight bit computer, what that means is that the digital circuits within the computer are designed to primarily handle single bytes. One famous instance of an eight bit computer is the original Nintendo Entertainment System.

=== Nibble ===

The value of a byte can be represented using eight digits, like so.

 10010110

Even though this is only eight digits, it can be a difficult for a person to read. One way to increase readability is to use some type of spacer or delimiter. We do this all the time with phone numbers (123-555-8765) or social security numbers (XXX-XX-XXXX). A common way to divide a byte is by placing a single space between the two halves of the byte, like so.

 1001 0110

When dividing a byte into halves like this, each half is called a '''nibble''' (because a nibble is a &quot;small byte&quot;). Few computers handle nibbles independently, although they do exist. Nibbles are usually only a convenient way to represent data organized into bytes.

== Word ==

Modern computers are built to handle pieces of digital data larger than a byte. These larger units of data are called '''words'''. The term word is a bit problematic, because its definition is not as strictly defined as a byte. A word could be any group of bits of a particular size, but most often a word is some number of bytes grouped together. Occasionally there will be a computer part that deals with an unusual word size, like 13 bits, but the most common word sizes are 16 bits, 32 bits and 64 bits.

The three common word sizes are sometimes referred to with specific names. The term '''word''' gets reused in this context to specifically mean a 16 bit word. A 32 bit word is called a '''double word''', and a 64 bit word is a '''quad word'''. The reuse of the term &quot;word&quot; to mean any group of bits, or specifically a group of 16 bits can be confusing. Most of the time it won't matter too much, but you will have to rely on the specific context to determine which meaning applies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The relevant Charter provision states under the heading of &quot;legal rights&quot;:
{{quotation|8. Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.}}

Privacy is &quot;at the heart of liberty in a modern state&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Edwards, [1996] 1 SCR 128&lt;/ref&gt; It is &quot;essential for the well-being of the individual&quot; and has a profound significance for the public order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; R v Edwards at 61&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a “protean concept”, meaning that it tends to be highly variable and change.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Tessling 2004 SCC 67 at para. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the right under s. 8 is to protect &quot;the citizen's right to a reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Colarusso, 1994 CanLII 134 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 20 at [http://canlii.ca/t/1frw6#par70 70]&lt;/ref&gt; and to &quot;prevent unreasonable intrusions on privacy, not to sort them out from unreasonable intrusions on an ex post facto analysis&quot;. 
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13 at 47&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that the principle of reasonable expectation of privacy is a &quot;normative rather than a descriptive standard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R v Tessling at para. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

The right is concerned with balancing the state's interest in law enforcement and privacy interests of persons.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tessling, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432 at 17&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; It is only when the state can &quot;demonstrate the superiority of its interest to that of the individual&quot; that a search can be valid.&lt;ref&gt;
Hunter et al. v. Southam Inc., [http://canlii.ca/t/1mgc1 1984 CanLII 33] (SCC), [1984] 2 SCR 145 at p.160&lt;/ref&gt; This point exists where there is reasonable and probable cause which lies at the point where &quot;point where credibly-based probability replaces suspicion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Hunter et al. v. Southam Inc at p. 114, 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this section police are prohibited from &quot;unreasonable&quot; searches. The inquiry of the lawfulness of a search is based on whether the search was &quot;reasonable&quot; in the circumstances. The circumstances include the nature of the duty performed as well as the purpose of the search.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Nicolosi 1998 CanLII 2006 (ON C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1998/1998canlii2006/1998canlii2006.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A search is only subject to Constitutional review where the search intrudes on a reasonable expectation of privacy of the accused.
&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Edwards 1996 CanLII 255 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128 at para. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Only where the privacy right exists that there is an inquiry into the reasonableness of the search.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 126 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1996/1996canlii255/1996canlii255.html]; Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (S.C.C.), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawful search must be (a) authorized by law; (b) the law itself must be reasonable; and (c) the manner in which the search was carried out must be reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. S.A.B.,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2003/2003scc60/2003scc60.html 2003 SCC 60]; R v Collins, 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC)&lt;/ref&gt;

A search consists of any state interference of a person's privacy interests.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Law, 2002 SCC 10, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 227, at para 15&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there is little distinction between the initial intrusion itself and the search subsequent to intrusion. &lt;Ref&gt;R. v. McCormack, [2000] B.C.J. No. 143 (B.C.C.A.) at para 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of a &quot;Search&quot;==

Any police conduct interfering with a reasonable expectation of privacy is a &quot;search&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;
Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Edwards, 1996 CanLII 255 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Law, 2002 SCC 10, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 227 at para. 15&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Wise, 1992 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 527 at 533 (only “[i]f the police activity invades a reasonable expectation of privacy, [that] the activity is a search”) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Any &quot;inspection is a search&quot; where where a &quot;person has a reasonable privacy interest in the object or subject matter of the state action and the information to which it gives access&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cole, [http://canlii.ca/t/ft969 2012 SCC 53] (CanLII), at para. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Knocking at the door for a investigative purpose is not a search.&lt;Ref&gt;
See R v MacDonald, 2012 NSCA 50 at 19&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Hope, 2007 NSCA 103 at para. 27 &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Evans, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 8 at para. 8&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, going onto private property and peering into windows while attempting to detect odours of marijuana can constitute a search.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Kokesch 1990 CanLII 55 (SCC), (1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 207 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Merely peering into a car windows at night using a flash-light while the car in on a public highway is not a search.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Mellenthin 1992 CanLII 50 (SCC), (1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at 486-87
&lt;/ref&gt;

Detection of an odour of marijuana from a bag, by an officer using his own senses, while performing other duties does not constitute a search.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Rajaratnam, 2006 ABCA 333, 2006 ABCA 333, 67 Alta. L.R. (4th) 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from detection with the use of technology, such as a sniffer dog or a FLIR device.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. R v Tessling [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, 2004 SCC 67&lt;/ref&gt;

However, police observations of stains on a shirt visible to the public is not a search.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hamadeh, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fw3p 2011 ONSC 1241] at 132 to 145&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Meaning of &quot;Seizure&quot;==

A &quot;seizure&quot; in essence is the &quot;taking of a thing from a person by a public authority without that person's consent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Dyment, 1988 CanLII 10, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417 at para. 26&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Law, 2002 SCC 10, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 227 at para. 15&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
An individual who gives something to an officer does not constitute a seizure. Rather it is merely the receipt of a thing.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Wills, [http://canlii.ca/t/1npnl 1992 CanLII 2780] (ON CA) at p. 347-348&lt;Br&gt;
Illinois v. Rodrigues, 110 S. Ct 2793 (1999) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Any &quot;taking is a seizure&quot; where &quot;a person has a reasonable privacy interest in the object or subject matter of the state action and the information to which it gives access&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Cole at para. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

A seizure does not have to be connected to a search.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. D.L.W., [http://canlii.ca/t/fts53 2012 BCSC 1700] (CanLII) at para. 63
&lt;/ref&gt;

Valid consent in this context is determined based on indicia such as:&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Wills, [http://canlii.ca/t/1npnl 1992 CanLII 2780] (ON CA) at p. 353&lt;Br&gt;
adopted in R. v. Borden, 1994 CanLII 63 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 145, at p. 162&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
#there was a consent, express or implied;
#the giver of the consent had the authority to give the consent in question;
#the consent was voluntary in the sense that that word is used in Goldman, supra, and was not the product of police oppression, coercion or other external conduct which negated the freedom to choose whether or not to allow the police to pursue the course of conduct requested;
#the giver of the consent was aware of the nature of the police conduct to which he or she was being asked to consent;
#the giver of the consent was aware of his or her right to refuse to permit the police to engage in the conduct requested; and,
#the giver of the consent was aware of the potential consequences of giving the consent.

Taking of a photograph by police has been considered a search or seizure.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Abbey, [2006] O.J. No. 4689 (S.C.J.); reversed on other grounds, 97 O.R. (3d) 330 (C.A.), [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 125: police took a photo of the accused's t-shirt after removing it from his body&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Zones of Protection==
The Charter right protects a person's reasonable expectation of privacy. This is a protection of persons ''not'' places.&lt;ref&gt;See Katz v US, 389 US 347 (1967) at p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;  

The right manifests itself in protecting the zones of the person, territory, and information.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tessling, [http://canlii.ca/t/1j0wb 2004 SCC 67] (CanLII), [2004] 3 SCR 432&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Gomboc, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dhlk 2010 SCC 55], [2010] 3 SCR 211 at para. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Reflist|2}}

===Personal Privacy===
Personal privacy &quot;protects bodily integrity, and in particular not to have our bodies touched or explored to disclose objects or matters we wish to conceal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R v Tessling, [2004] 3 SCR 432 at para 21&lt;/ref&gt; It is for that reason that it is considered the strongest of the forms of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of privacy is most often considered in a strip search&lt;ref&gt;e.g. R v Golden, [2001] 3 SCR 679&lt;/ref&gt; or a warrantless seizure of a bodily sample.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. R v Stillman, [1997] 1 SCR 607&lt;br&gt;
R v Colarusso, [1994] 1 SCR 20&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Territorial Privacy===
Privacy over personal territory traces back to the English common law with the maxim that &quot;the house of everyone is to him as his castle and fortress&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;Semayne's Case at para. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This has since been adopted into the common law of Canada and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.&lt;Ref&gt;
Adopted in common law in Eccles v. Bourque et al., [http://canlii.ca/t/1z1gw 1974 CanLII 191] (SCC), [1975] 2 SCR 739, &lt;Br&gt;
Adopted as applicable to Charter in Colet v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpb2 1981 CanLII 11] (SCC), [1981] 1 SCR 2&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Reflist|2}}

===Informational Privacy===
The right protects the &quot;biographical core of personal information&quot; that includes &quot;information which tends to reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the individual.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Plant, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs0w 1993 CanLII 70] (SCC), [1993] 3 SCR 281&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Purpose of Search==
The purpose of the search is a relevant to the analysis of the search. The most frequent form of search is a search for evidence of a commission of an offence, criminal or otherwise. Secondarily, there will be searches for the purpose of officer safety. Each type of search will have different scope of powers of search.

{{Reflist|2}}

==Party Performing the Search==
Section 8 of the Charter governs searches by government and its agents. The scope and degree of privacy is always with respect to a particular party.

An employee of a private company become an agent of the state when they are directed to perform a task by the police.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Liang, [http://canlii.ca/t/1r3nj 2007 YKTC 18] at para 241&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Dorfer, [http://canlii.ca/t/2326g 1996 CanLII 10214] (BC CA) at para. 39&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, where the actions of the employee, company, or person, were strictly voluntary then they are not agents of the state.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Gomboc [http://canlii.ca/t/2dhlk 2010 SCC 55], [2010] 3 SCR 211&lt;br&gt;
c.f. R. v. Poh, [http://canlii.ca/t/fn5qs 2011 MBQB 214]
&lt;/ref&gt;

A police informer wearing a wire is an agent of the state.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Broyles, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fshb 1991 CanLII 15] (SCC), [1991] 3 SCR 595&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees of government agencies, such as social workers, who discover or investigate possible offences are agents of the state.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Choy, [http://canlii.ca/t/21qxs 2008 ABQB 737] at para 28 - social worker discovering bruising&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Westrageer et al, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lwwm 2005 BCSC 1558] at para 43: social working investigating child welfare complaint&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Chang, [http://canlii.ca/t/4s1h 2003 ABCA 293] : private security guard seizing property for police
c.f. R. v. Allen, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dvjl 2010 CanLII 73011] (NL PC)
&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, a private citizen performing a citizen's arrest and searching a person in anticipation of the arrival of the police is an agent of the state.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Lerke, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nnwz 1986 ABCA 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

An Internet Service Provider forwarding information on the discovery of child pornography is acting as an agent of the state.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Weir, [http://canlii.ca/t/5rdq 2001 ABCA 181] at para. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Organizational Pre-Trials==

Under s. 625.1(1) the Court has the power to order that a conference be held between the parties to speed up the trial processs. The section states that:
:Subject to subsection (2), on application by the prosecutor or the accused or on its own motion, the court, or a judge of the court, before which, or the judge, provincial court judge or justice before whom, any proceedings are to be held may order that a conference between the prosecutor and the accused or counsel for the accused, to be presided over by the court, judge, provincial court judge or justice, be held prior to the proceedings to consider the matters that, to promote a fair and expeditious hearing, would be better decided before the start of the proceedings, and other similar matters, and to make arrangements for decisions on those matters.

This is also addressed through section 482.1:
:(1) A court referred to in subsection 482(1) or (2) may make rules for case management, including rules
::(a) for the determination of any matter that would assist the court in effective and efficient case management;

Pre-Trial conferences can be helpful for a number of reasons:
# Narrow issues for trial -- parties may be able to agree on certain facts not in dispute at trial
# Learn the opponent's theory and strategy
# Gauge potential sentences -- in certain circumstances possible sentencing proposals can be bounced off the judge to get a sense of the likely outcome in a disputed sentencing hearing.
# Settle the case

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The &quot;principles of fundamental justice&quot; under section 7 of the Charter include the &quot;right to effective assistance of counsel&quot; in the criminal justice system.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. G.D.B., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, [http://canlii.ca/t/526g 2000 SCC 22], at para. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been adopted in Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Garofoli, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1988/1988canlii3270/1988canlii3270.html 1988 CanLII 3270 (ONCA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nova Scotia,&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Schofield (G.R.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nssc/doc/1996/1996canlii5462/1996canlii5462.html 1996 CanLII 5462 (NSSC)]&lt;/ref&gt; and British Columbia&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Strauss (D.W.), [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/1995/1995canlii702/1995canlii702.html 1995 CanLII 702 (BCCA)]&lt;/ref&gt; that the proper test is as stated in the US case of Strickland v. Washington, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984) which states that:
{{cquote|
A convicted defendant’s claim that counsel’s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction or death sentence has two components. First, the defendant must show that counsel’s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.” }}

A claim for ineffective assistance or incompetent counsel has two components. There must be performance that is incompetent (performance component) and the performance must result in a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot; (the prejudice component). &lt;ref&gt;
R v Gardiner, 2010 NBCA 46 at para. 2&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Thusly, the applicant must prove:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. G. (D.M.), [http://canlii.ca/t/fl79g 2011 ONCA 343] at para. 100&lt;br&gt; 
R v B(J) [http://canlii.ca/t/flkd4 2011 ONCA 404] at para. 2&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Joanisse [http://canlii.ca/t/6jmw 1995 CanLII 3507] (ON CA), (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (ONCA), at p. 59 leave to appeal refused, [1996] S.C.C.A. No. 347&lt;br&gt;
R v White [http://canlii.ca/t/5s25 1997 CanLII 2426] (ON CA), (1997), 99 OAC 1 at paras 63-65, 114 CCC (3d) 225; leave to appeal denied, 117 CCC (3d) vi (SCC)
&lt;/ref&gt;
# the facts that underpin the claim on a balance of probabilities;
# the act or omission that was believed to be incompetent assistance by counsel;
# the incompetent assistance caused a miscarriage of justice by undermining either appearance of a fair trial or reliability of the verdict.

There is a presumption in favour of competence.

The level of competence expected is on a reasonableness standard for the particular case at the time.&lt;Ref&gt;Joanisse 1995 CanLII 3507 (ON CA) at pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; The court cannot use the benefit of hindsight in their analysis.

Absent a possible injustice flowing from the incompetency of counsel there can be no appeal. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ensor, [1989] 1 W.L.R. 497 (C.A.), Lord Lane, C.J.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Courts are generally deferential to counsel in their conduct and given them wide latitude with defence strategy.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Kelly 52 O.A.C. 241 (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Jim, [2003] B.C.J. No. 1663 (Q.L.)(C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The claimant will usually need to adduce fresh evidence by affidavit or oral testimony that sets out the deficiencies in trial counsel. The trial counsel will then be permitted to respond to the allegations. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. O'Keefe (No. 2), [http://canlii.ca/t/frczp 2012 NLCA 25] at 14&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Freake, [http://canlii.ca/t/fq5m3 2012 NLCA 10]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A court should not &quot;blindly&quot; accept an appellant's affidavit of evidence without any evidence from the trial counsel or trial record suggesting something is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Munson, [http://canlii.ca/t/fv824 2012 MBCA 111] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless the transcript confirms the allegations, the appeal counsel should present evidence from trial counsel. Where the transcript raises concerns of competence, the court should order evidence be taken from the trial counsel. If the court is satisfied from the surrounding circumstances and trial transcript that there is no valid concern, then the court can dismiss the appeal at a preliminary stage for failing to establish a factual foundation. In effect, a affidavit from the appellant does not necessarily establish a prima facie case.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Le (T.D.), [http://canlii.ca/t/frj5d 2011 MBCA 83] (CanLII) at para. 178&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some courts of appeal have protocols for handling appeals on incompetent counsel.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Munson, [http://canlii.ca/t/fv824 2012 MBCA 111] (CanLII) see appendix&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Lay opinion, being an opinion of a person who is not qualified as an expert, can be admissible in trial where the opinion constitutes  a &quot;compendious statement&quot; of the observations of a witness in relation to matters of common experience where no special knowledge is required and the opinion is so close to fact that it is impossible to separate the two. &lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Graat, [1982] 2 SCR 819, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpcx 1982 CanLII 33] (SCC) &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Collins (2001), 160 CCC 85 (Ont. CA), [http://canlii.ca/t/1f8hn 2001 CanLII 24124] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt; This is an exception to the rule that non-experts cannot give opinion evidence.

Lay opinion has been found to be valid in relation to the following:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Expert opinion is testimonial evidence that gives an opinion on facts perceived by him or another that concerns an issue that is likely outside the experience and knoweldge of the trier-of-fact (i.e. a lay person).
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. J-L J, [2000] 2 SCR 600 at para 56 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc51/2000scc51.html];&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 SCR 24
&lt;/ref&gt;
The expert must have special knowledge in the matter
&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Terceira (1998) 123 CCC 1 (Ont. CA)
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the opinion must be ''reasonably necessary'' to assist the trier-of-fact to make a proper judgment.
&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Mohan, [1994] SCR 9 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1994/1994canlii80/1994canlii80.html];&lt;br&gt;
R. v. C.G. (1996) Nfld. CA;&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lovie (1995) Ont. CA
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The expert is not to testify to facts, but rather only opinion to allow the trier-of-fact to draw inferences.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Parrott, [2001] 1 SCR 178 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2001/2001scc3/2001scc3.html]&lt;br&gt;

==Requirements to Adduced Expert Evidence==

Section 657.3 permits a party to adduce expert evidence without the need to have the expert give viva vice evidence:
{{quotation|
'''Expert testimony'''&lt;br&gt;
657.3 (1) In any proceedings, the evidence of a person as an expert may be given by means of a report accompanied by the affidavit or solemn declaration of the person, setting out, in particular, the qualifications of the person as an expert if
:(a) the court recognizes that person as an expert; and
:(b) the party intending to produce the report in evidence has, before the proceeding, given to the other party a copy of the affidavit or solemn declaration and the report and reasonable notice of the intention to produce it in evidence.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Attendance for examination'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the court may require the person who appears to have signed an affidavit or solemn declaration referred to in that subsection to appear before it for examination or cross-examination in respect of the issue of proof of any of the statements contained in the affidavit or solemn declaration or report.
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;
1997, c. 18, s. 80; 2002, c. 13, s. 62.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec657.3 CCC]
}}
See also: s. 16 and s. 150.1 of the Code.

A party cannot call more than five witnesses without leave of the court.&lt;ref&gt;
s. 7 of the Canada Evidence Act
&lt;/ref&gt;

Under 657.3, the judge may order compliance, seek particulars, or adjourn. He may not prohibit the the witness from testifying who complies with the section.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Horan, [http://canlii.ca/t/209v1 2008 ONCA 589] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under s.7 of the Canada Evidence Act, where any party intends to &quot;examine as witnesses, professional or other experts entitled according to the law or practice to give opinion evidence, not more than five of such witnesses may be called on either side without the leave of the court or judge or person presiding.&quot;

{{reflist|2}}

===Notice===
A party may call a witness as an expert under [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec657.3 s. 657.3 (1)].  A party intending to call the expert witness must give notice at least 30 days prior to the commencement of trial or within the time set by the judge. 
&lt;ref&gt; s. 657.3(3)(a)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Salter, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/2005/2005nsca129/2005nsca129.html 2005 NSCA 129]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 657.3(3) states:
{{Quotation|
'''Notice for expert testimony'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purpose of promoting the fair, orderly and efficient presentation of the testimony of witnesses,
:(a) a party who intends to call a person as an expert witness shall, at least thirty days before the commencement of the trial or within any other period fixed by the justice or judge, give notice to the other party or parties of his or her intention to do so, accompanied by
::(i) the name of the proposed witness,
::(ii) a description of the area of expertise of the proposed witness that is sufficient to permit the other parties to inform themselves about that area of expertise, and
::(iii) a statement of the qualifications of the proposed witness as an expert;
:(b) in addition to complying with paragraph (a), a prosecutor who intends to call a person as an expert witness shall, within a reasonable period before trial, provide to the other party or parties
::(i) a copy of the report, if any, prepared by the proposed witness for the case, and
::(ii) if no report is prepared, a summary of the opinion anticipated to be given by the proposed witness and the grounds on which it is based; and
:(c) in addition to complying with paragraph (a), an accused, or his or her counsel, who intends to call a person as an expert witness shall, not later than the close of the case for the prosecution, provide to the other party or parties the material referred to in paragraph (b).
}}

{{Reflist|2}}

===If Notice is Not Given===
Section 657.3(4) states that where the notice requirements of s. 657.3(3) are not complied with, the available remedies are as follows:
* &quot;adjournment of the proceedings to the party who requests it to allow him or her to prepare for cross-examination of the expert witness;&quot; (657.3(4)(a))
* an &quot;order the party who called the expert witness to provide that other party and any other party with the material referred to in paragraph (3)(b);&quot; and (657.3(4)(b))
* an &quot;order the calling or recalling of any witness for the purpose of giving testimony on matters related to those raised in the expert witness’s testimony, unless the court considers it inappropriate to do so.&quot; (657.3(4)(c))

These remedies do not include the power to prohibit the party from calling the expert.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Horan, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2008/2008onca589/2008onca589.html 2008 ONCA 589]&lt;br&gt;
Somerville v. R., [http://canlii.ca/t/fqctg 2012 NBCA 23] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Other Use of the Materials===
Under s. 657.3 (6), the prosecution is prohibited from using any of the materials given to him by defence for as part of its own case where the expert does not testify except for cross-examination without the consent of the accused. It further cannot be used for any other proceedings. (657.3(7))

== Qualification ==
A trial judge must determine on a ''voir dire'' whether the individual is qualified as an expert, and if so, what the &quot;nature and scope of the proposed expert evidence&quot; will be.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Preeper and Doyle (1888) SCR&lt;/ref&gt; The qualification process is one of delineating the boundaries of the evidence and the language used.  
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624 [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2009/2009onca624/2009onca624.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. K. A., 1999 CanLII 3793 (ON C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1999/1999canlii3793/1999canlii3793.html]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The judge cannot permit the expert to give an opinion on common matters or matters that the expert has no special skills, knowledge, or training. 

To qualify a person as an expert, the evidence must meet the ''Mohan'' requirements:
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Mohan, supra&lt;/ref&gt;
# the opinion must be ''relevant'';
# the opinion must be ''necessary'' to assist the trier-of-fact to draw the correct inference;
# the ''absence'' of any other exclusionary rule;
# the required qualifications of the proposed expert.

The ''relevance'' requirement includes both ''logical relevance'' (the relationship between the evidence and the fact in issue it is being used to establish) and ''legal relevance'' (the probative value). (R. v. K.(A.), 1999 137 CCC 3d 225 (ONCA))

The ''necessity'' requirement is not a strict standard. It is necessary where it furnishes scientific information that is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of the trier of fact.(R. v. B.(R.H.), [1994] 2 SCR 656)

Qualified expert evidence can nonetheless be excluded if: (R. v. D.D. [2000] 2 SCR 275) 
# the evidence would tend to usurp the duty of the trier of fact
# the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value
# the time required outweighs its probative value
# the cost required outweighs the probative value
# the influence of the evidence outweighs the evidence's reliability.

The proposed expert must have some indicia of scientific knowledge. It cannot be admitted if the witness is giving personal opinions based on their experience, knowledge from &quot;some&quot; literature, and interviews. (R. v. Bedford (2000), 143 CCC 3d 311)

Expert evidence should be expected to be impartial to be admissible. There must not be any bias or appearance of bias.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Docherty [2010] OJ No. 2460 - father of defence counsel writes psych report, found invalid&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Novel Sciences==
Novel sciences must be considered on a case-by-case basis. There are no fixed categories where the requirements for expert evidence have been met.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852 battered wife syndrome accepted as science&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The courts must individually distinguish between new sciences and &quot;junk&quot; sciences. As such, needs &quot;special scrutiny&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. J.(-L.),  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc51/2000scc51.html 2000 SCC 51]&lt;/ref&gt;

Novel sciences must only be qualified if it is (1) necessary and (2) reliable&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Terceira (1998) 123 CCC 3d 1 (ONCA)[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1998/1998canlii2174/1998canlii2174.html 1998 CanLII 2174]&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence can still be admissible even if the scientific theory is open to debate or that there are exceptional cases to the theory.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. M.(B.) 1998 130 CCC 353 (ONCA)[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1998/1998canlii13326/1998canlii13326.html 1998 CanLII 13326]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary to establish that the field be one that is subject to &quot;peer review&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Abbey (2009), 246 C.C.C. (3d) 301, [2009] O.J. No. 3534, 2009 ONCA 624 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 97 - lower court erred in requiring peer review
&lt;/ref&gt;

Expertise &quot;may be acquired through study&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
McWilliams’ Canadian Criminal Evidence (4th) at 12:30.20.50. citing Mohan at 414&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the subject, it may not be necessary that the expert have a university degree in the subject to be an expert.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bulman, [2007] O.J. No. 913 (QL) (C.A.) at para. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of writing or publications will generally go to weight and not admissibility.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. B.M., [http://canlii.ca/t/1nptj 1998 CanLII 13326] (ON CA) at para. 71&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Evidence==
Once the witness is qualified as an expert they are permitted to give evidence in the area for which they were qualified. 
The opinion evidence will be related by way of hypothetical questions put to the expert.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Fiqia (1994) 162 A.R. 117 (C.A.) &lt;/ref&gt; However, the testimony cannot be &quot;oath-helping&quot; evidence.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Reid, 2003 CanLII 14779 (ON C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2003/2003canlii14779/2003canlii14779.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The hypotheticals can be put to the expert where the facts are not dispute.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bleta, [1964] SCR 561 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1964/1964canlii14/1964canlii14.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  If the underlying facts are in dispute the opinion cannot remove the fact-finding function of the trier-of-fact.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. P.G., 2009 ONCA 32 [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2009/2009onca32/2009onca32.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The cross examiner can put to the expert any proven or provable facts to determine whether it alters the confidence of a the opinion.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Kerr, 2000 BCCA 209 [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2000/2000bcca209/2000bcca209.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The expert must cite the bases on his opinion in order for the trier-of-fact to evaluate the opinion.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Neil, [1957] S.C.R. 685 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1957/1957canlii70/1957canlii70.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Grandinetti, 2003 ABCA 307 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2003/2003abca307/2003abca307.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Trudel, 1994 CanLII 5397 (QC CA) [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qcca/doc/1994/1994canlii5397/1994canlii5397.html]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The expert can use sources and information found in the &quot;scope of his or her expertise&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. S.A.B., 2003 SCC 60, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 678 at 63 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2003/2003scc60/2003scc60.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as sources outside his knowledge in limited contexts.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Anderson (1914), 22 C.C.C. 455&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Godfrey, [1974] 4 W.W.R. 677, 18 C.C.C. (2d) 90 (Alta. C.A.), at pp. 102-104
&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;second hand&quot; evidence of texts is not admissible as evidence, but can be used to show the information on which the opinion is based.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1994/1994canlii127/1994canlii127.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

An expert may be cross-examined on a text, report or article relating to his area of expertise.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. c. Taillefer, 1995 CanLII 4592 (QC C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qcca/doc/1995/1995canlii4592/1995canlii4592.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Marquard [1993] 3 SCR 223 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1993/1993canlii37/1993canlii37.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Conroy, (1993), Ont.C.A.
&lt;/ref&gt; The expert can only comment on works they are familiar with. If the expert acknowledges the authority, the examiner may read parts of the document to the witness to the extent that it is accepted as valid. 

A judge may reject the uncontradicted expert evidence as unreasonable.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Prince, (1971) OntCA&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lambkin, 2002 MBCA 157 [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2002/2002mbca157/2002mbca157.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;
The evidence should not be rejected if there is no contradictory evidence and the opinion is not seriously challenged.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Molodowic, 2000 SCC 16, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 420 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc16/2000scc16.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drug Expert'''&lt;br&gt;
A lay person such as an RCMP officer cannot be a reliable expert simply by &quot;conducting numerous casual conversations with drug users or traffickers.&quot;  This sort of &quot;[a]necdotal evidence cannot be tested or verified hearsay must be supplemented and supported by some form of admissible evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Klassen, [2003] M.J. No. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evaluating Conflicting Expert Evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
Where the evidence of multiple experts conflict, it is not a matter of chosing one expert over the other, but rather giving weight to each expert and review the opinions as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Jonkman, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfwq 2012 SKQB 511] (CanLII) at para. 97&lt;br&gt;

      <comment>/* Closing submissions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Opening submissions==
Inflamatory remarks during opening submissions may allow for a mistrial.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart v. Speer (1953), [1953] O.R. 502 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;Br&gt; 
Landolfi v. Fargione (2006), 2006 CarswellOnt 1855 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}
==Closing submissions==

Both counsel have a &quot;fair degree of latitude&quot; on their closings. They are each entitled to &quot;advance his ... position forcefully and effectively&quot;, it is expected that there will be &quot;a degree of rhetorical passion in that presentation.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Daly, (1992), 57 O.A.C. 70, at p. 76&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Boudreau, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftxzt 2012 ONCA 830] (CanLII) at para. 15 onward&lt;br&gt;
see also R. v. Mallory, 2007 ONCA 46 (CanLII), 217 C.C.C. (3d) 266 , at para. 339&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Crown must: &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Boudreau, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftxzt 2012 ONCA 830] (CanLII) at para. 16&lt;br&gt;
Mallory 2007 ONCA 46&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;abstain from inflammatory rhetoric&quot;, 
* abstain from &quot;demeaning commentary and sarcasm&quot;, 
* not &quot;misstate the law&quot;,
* &quot;not invite the jury to engage in speculation&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
see Mallory, at para. 340&lt;/ref&gt;
* not &quot;express personal opinions about either the evidence or the veracity of a witness&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
see Mallory, at para. 340&lt;/ref&gt;

Violations of these requirements may sometimes result in a mistrial. However, the prejudices arising from this conduct can often be remedied by additional jury instructions.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Boudreau, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftxzt 2012 ONCA 830] (CanLII) at para. 20&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge must allow counsel an opportunity to make closing submission in full.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Al-Fartossy, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2007/2007abca427/2007abca427.html 2007 ABCA 427], 425 A.R. 336 at para. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the judge can still comment on the evidence during the submissions and may attempt at focusing the argument on particular issues of concern. The judge cannot prevent counsel from making submissions on relevant issues.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hodson, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2001/2001abca111/2001abca111.html 2001 ABCA 111] at paras. 33 and 35&lt;/ref&gt; 
A trial judge does not have to be silent during submissions and can voice concerns.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. W.F.M. (1995), 169 A.R. 222 (C.A.) at para. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
He is permitted to express a preliminary opinion on the evidence or the law during submissions.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v Baccari, 2011 ABCA 205 at para. 24&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v Johnson,  2010 ABCA 392 at para. 14&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where counsel makes false or erroneous submissions in the address to a jury, the judge must give corrections in the jury instruction.&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Romeo, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1991/1991canlii113/1991canlii113.html 1991 CanLII 113] (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 86 at para. 95&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Rose, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii768/1998canlii768.html 1998 CanLII 768] (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262 at paras. 126 and 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The party calling a witness does not need to assert that the trier of fact accept everything said by the witness wholesale. &lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Benji, 2012 BCCA 55 at 158&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Biniaris, 1998 CanLII 14986 (BC CA) at 9&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Crown counsel is entitled to invite the trier of fact to be selective of the evidence they chose to believe from the witness that the Crown called.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Walker, [http://canlii.ca/t/231tg 1994 CanLII 8725 (ON CA)] at 156&lt;/ref&gt; 
Crown counsel can ask that the trier reject evidence of a Crown witness in preference of other evidence heard. However, counsel cannot ask for the rejection of evidence in favour of a theory not in evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;Walker at 157&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, a party is not precluded from calling evidence that may contradict other witnesses called by the same party.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Biniaris, 1998 CanLII 14986 (BC CA) at 10 citing Cariboo Observer Ltd. v. Carson Truck Lines Ltd. and Tyrell (1961), 32 D.L.R. (2d) 36 at 39, 37 W.W.W. 209 (B.C.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Crown has completed their evidence, it is not allowed to change it's theory of the case because of the addition of defence evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. G.(S.G.), 1997 CanLII 311 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716&lt;/ref&gt;

Submissions by counsel on issues before the court cannot be intentionally or inadvertently denied by the court. A failure would result in a new trial.&lt;Ref&gt;
Dewey v. Dawson-Moran, 2011 ABCA 45 at 12&lt;br&gt;
R v Komarnicki, 2012 SKQB 140&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation by Agent==
An agent generally may not represent an accused on a summary conviction appeal.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Duggan, [1976] O.J. No. 418 (QL), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 167 (ONCA) at 9, 11;&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Stagg, [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbqb/doc/2011/2011mbqb294/2011mbqb294.html 2011 MBQB 294]&lt;br&gt; 
Aasland v. Mirecki, [2002] M.J. No. 502 (QL), 37 C.P.C. (5th) 230&lt;br&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; 
This is usually prohibited both under common law and under the provincial law society act. The primary reason is to protect the administration of justice and the right to a fair trial by ensuring competent representation.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Romanowicz, 1999 CanLII 1315 (ON CA), (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 74&lt;/ref&gt;Certain provinces, such as British Columbia (R. v. Dick,  2002 BCCA 27) and Alberta&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Crooks, 2011 ABCA 239 at 8-10&lt;/ref&gt;, allow limited exception to this rule on the discretion of the judge.


{{reflist|close=1}}

==Self-Representation==
Representation by counsel is not necessary to have a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Rain [http://canlii.ca/t/5shs 1998 ABCA 315] (CanLII), (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 167 at 182
(&quot;Representation by a lawyer is not a prerequisite for a fair trial. A person is entitled to represent himself or herself and when he or she does so, there are other means which are intended to protect the right to a fair trial, the foremost being the duty of every trial judge to ensure that all persons receive a fair trial.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;
An accused person may always chose to represent him or herself. However, individuals who represent themselves are not entitled to legal advice and strategy advice from the judge.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gendreau, [http://canlii.ca/t/fn4bp 2011 ABCA 256] at 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial judge has an obligation to ensure that a self-represented individual has a fair trial. This includes assisting in the conduct of the defence to ensure that the defence is effectively brought out.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Moghaddam, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mtw4 2006 BCCA 136] at 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of assistance to provide is a matter of the court's discretion. The judge does not need to become the accused's advocate, but must provide a &quot;minimum level of assistance&quot; to ensure a fair trial. 
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tran, [2001] O.R. (3d) 161 at para. 31&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Moreno-Baches, [2002] O.J. No. 4480 per Juriansz J. at para. 6&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Conducting a fair trial with a self-represented accused requires a &quot;significant degree of instruction and vigilance.&quot; This will generally require that the judge explain the course which the trial is to take, including:&lt;ref&gt;Tran, supra at 33&lt;/ref&gt;
# the arraignment, 
# the calling of crown witnesses, 
# the right to cross examine witnesses,
# the right to object to irrelevant evidence
# the right to call witnesses,
# the right and associated risks with the decision to testify
# the right to make closing arguments

{{reflist|2}}

==Right to be Heard==
There is a fundamental tenant that all parties affected by a decision shall be given an opportunity to be heard by the court before the court makes a ruling. This is the principle of  '''audi alteram partem principle'''.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gustavson, 2005 BCCA 32 at 64&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|close=1}}
== Withdraw by Counsel ==
An accused has a right to defend himself (s. 651(2)) and so cannot be forced to retain or maintain counsel. The accused has a right to terminate representation by a lawyer at any time, including during trial. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Spataro (1974) SCR; R. v. Huber, 2003 BCCA 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Counsel may not withdraw without leave of the court. Permission to withdraw will be granted where the interests of the lawyer and client are irreconcilable. Once the lawyer has withdrawn they are under no obligation to provide assistance to the accused by way of legal advice or counselling.

Where counsel is seeking to withdraw as counsel due to non-payment of retainer. The court has discretion to refuse the request are require counsel to complete the matter.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cunningham, 2010 SCC 10&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|close=1}}
== Discharging Counsel ==
The accused has an unfettered right to his counsel at any time for any reason. The Court has not authority to interfere with this decision or force an unwilling accused to continue to be represented by the discharged counsel.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cunningham, [http://canlii.ca/t/28tlt 2010 SCC 10], [2010] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Amicus Curae ==
A superior court and provincial court dealing with criminal matters, has the authority to appoint ''amicus curiae''. This power arises from their authority to &quot;control their processes in order to function as courts of law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Russel, [http://canlii.ca/t/fl3xg 2011 ONCA 303] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

The court may also set the terms and conditions of the appointment related to counsel's compensation.&lt;ref&gt;
Russel&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''amicus curiae'' is counsel appointed by the court to assist an accused in representing himself. This is a more limited role than accused's counsel and does not require the confidence or consent of the accused. The amicus will provide assistance such as 
#objecting to perceived legal errors;
#assisting the appellant in drafting a statement of the defence position;
#assisting the appellant in subpoenaing any defence witnesses; and
#advising the appellant on any questions of law.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Amos, [http://canlii.ca/t/frdtr 2012 ONCA 334]&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of an ''amicus curiae'' &quot;implies the friendly intervention of counsel to remind the Court of some matter of law which has escaped its notice and in regard to which it is in danger of going wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Samra (1998), 129 C.C.C.(3d) 145 citing R v Grice (1957), 119 C.C.C. 18 per Ferguson J.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the accused discharges their counsel who is subsequently appointed as amicus curiae, the accused can only appeal the appointment if there is an actual conflict of interest between the accused and his counsel.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Samra, [http://canlii.ca/t/440t 1998 CanLII 7174] (ON CA), (1998) 129 C.C.C.(3d) 145 at 160 per Rosenberg JA (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Under 486.3(1), in any proceedings involving a cross-examination of a witness under 18 years of age and the accused is self-represented, the prosecutor or witness may apply to have counsel appointed to conduct the cross-examination unless the &quot;proper administration of justice requires&quot;.

Under 486.3(2),  in any proceedings involving a cross-examination of a witness and the accused is self-represented, the prosecutor or witness may apply to have counsel appointed to conduct the cross-examination where it is necessary &quot;in order to obtain a full and candid account&quot;.

Under 486.3(4), in any proceedings involving a cross-examination of a witness with respect to an offence of criminal harassment (264) and the accused is self-represented, the prosecutor or witness may apply to have counsel appointed to conduct the cross-examination unless the &quot;proper administration of justice requires&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Powers and Responsibilities of the Judge==
An accused person is entitled to a Constitutional right to an impartial trier-of-fact.&lt;ref&gt;
See s. 11(d) of the Charter which is the right &quot;...to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
See also R. v. Valente (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.)&lt;br&gt; 
R.  v.  Campbell (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a judge begins hearing evidence and makes a ruling on it, the judge becomes seized with the matter and no other judge can take over.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Curtis, [1991] 66 C.C.C. (3d) 156 (Ont. Gen. Div.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Process===
A Superior Court Justice has the inherent jurisdiction to eliminate any procedural unfairness that arises during a trial.&lt;ref&gt;  R. v. Rose, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii768/1998canlii768.html 1998 CanLII 768]&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;procedural directions contained in the Code are of necessity exhaustive&quot;. The powers of a provincial court judge are &quot;entirely statutory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Doyle [http://canlii.ca/t/1z6fv 1976 CanLII 11] (SCC), [1977] 1 S.C.R. 597&lt;/ref&gt; However, &quot;the authority to control the court's process and oversee the conduct of counsel is necessarily implied in the grant of power to function as a court of law. This Court has affirmed that courts can apply a ‘doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication’ when determining the powers of a statutory tribunal.” &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cunningham, [2010] S.C.R. 331 at para 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherent powers of a superior court judge to control the court process is said to be equally available to provincial court judges either expressly by statute or by necessary implication.&lt;ref&gt;
R vs Doyle 1976 CanLII 11 (SCC), [1977] 1 SCR 597, per Ritchie, J. (&quot;Whatever inherent powers may be possessed by a superior court judge in controlling the process of his own Court, it is my opinion that the powers and functions of a magistrate acting under the Criminal Code are circumscribed by the provisions of that statute and must be found to have been thereby conferred either expressly or by necessary implication.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Consequently, a provincial court judge has implied jurisdiction to &quot;vary one of its own orders in order to correct clerical mistakes or errors arising from an accidental slip or omission or in order to properly reflect the intention of the court&quot;&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Rhingo, [1997] O.J. No. 1110 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Robichaud, [2012] N.B.J. No. 175 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Generally, a &quot;court has a limited power to reconsider and vary its judgment disposing of the case as long as the court is not functus.”&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Adams, 1995 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 707, at para 29&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Limiting evidence===
The judge is required to listen to evidence that &quot;advances the work of the court&quot;. He or she cannot be required to listen to irrelevant or pointless evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Malmo-Levin 2003 SCR&lt;/ref&gt; The judge may even disallow the submission of non-relevant evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Schneider, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/2004/2004nsca99/2004nsca99.html 2004 NSCA 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge has an obligation to track the admission of evidence to ensure that the record is restricted to what is admissible, and also that it is only used for the purpose for which it was admitted.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Morrisey [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1995/1995canlii3498/1995canlii3498.html 1995 CanLII 3498] (ON CA), (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Smith, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2011/2011onca564/2011onca564.html 2011 ONCA 564] at 59&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge has the jurisdiction to edit the evidence, including written statements and oral testimony, as it is given. The judge may edit out portions of the evidence that is prejudicial or otherwise irrelevant or immaterial only so long as it does not distort the probative evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Dubois (1986), ___ (Ont.C.A.);R. v. Toten (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 225 (Ont.C.A.) [http://canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1993/1993canlii3427/1993canlii3427.html 1993 CanLII 3427]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact Finding===
Evidence before a judge are not facts. The judge has the power to hear evidence from which factual conclusions may be made. The Judge may make inferences. These inferences must be logical conclusions drawn from the evidence before the judge at trial. They cannot be conjecture or speculation about potential evidence that has not be submitted before the court.&lt;ref&gt;Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd [1939] 3 All ER 722&lt;/ref&gt;

There are generally well known inferences, that a judge will make regularly such as the inference &quot;that one intends the natural consequences of one’s actions [in] any ... human activity, especially in light of the lack of evidence to rebut the inference.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R.v. Missions [http://canlii.ca/t/1knrn 2005 NSCA 82]  at 21&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Sitting Position of Accused===
Sitting arrangment of the accused in the court is in the sole discretion of the trial judge.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Levogiannis, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frxq 1993 CanLII 47], [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475  at para. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Custom dictates that the accused is to be placed in the dock which is not said to violate the accused’s Charter rights.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Gervais [http://canlii.ca/t/1wd19 2001 CanLII 28428] (ON SC) at 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury should be able to see the accused during the trial. This interest may prevent the accused from requesting a seat at counsel table to give instructions.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McCarthy, [2012 CanLII 10661 2012 CanLII 10661] (NL SCTD) [refused request to sit at counsel table]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Judge Following a Case===
Once a judge hears evidence or facts on a case they are seized with the case and must follow the matter to its conclusion.

Where a judge falls ill, they remain seized with the matter unless there is unreasonable delay that results.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Brown, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpw65 2012 ONSC 822] &lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Doctrine of Functus Officio===
A judge has jurisdiction over an outstanding charge up to the point where the charge has been resolved by way of a stay, withdraw, dismissal, acquittal, or sentencing. The doctrine of functus officio refers to the principle that a court no longer has jurisdiction to change any decisions once a charge has reached its ultimate conclusion.

This common law rule states that the final judgement of a court cannot be reopened. &lt;ref&gt;
originates from Re St. Nazaire Co. (1879), 12 Ch. D. 88&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
The power to review a decision is transferred by the Judicature Act to the appellate division.

This rule only applies to judgements that have been drawn up, issued and entered.&lt;Ref&gt;
Chandler v. Alberta association of architects, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ft28 1989 CanLII 41] (SCC), [1989] 2 SCR 848
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that a court is functus if and only if &quot;the duties and functions of the [court’s] original commission have been fully accomplished&quot;&lt;ref&gt; 
Jacobs Catalytic Ltd. vs International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local #353 2009 ONCA 749;  312 DLR (4th) 250 at para. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions to this rule. The court may still interfere with a prior decision where:&lt;ref&gt;Chandler v. Alberta association of architects, supra&lt;/ref&gt;
# where there had been a slip in drawing it up, and,
# where there was an error in expressing the manifest intention of the court

A trial judge sitting without a jury is functus officio only after he has imposed his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. MacDonald 1991 CanLII 2424 (NS CA), (1991), 107 N.S.R. (2d) 374
&lt;/ref&gt;

An intermittent jail sentence cannot be varied by the sentencing court to a non-intermittent.&lt;ref&gt;
R v. Germaine (1980) 39 NSR (2d) 177 at para. 5 - no jurisdiction to make intermittent to non-intermittent because not in text of 732&lt;br&gt;
R v Jules [1988] BCJ 1605&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
There is some authority suggesting that the court may vary the entry and exit times of the intermittent sentence based on the power of the court to control its own process.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. E.K., [http://canlii.ca/t/frc2s 2012 BCPC 132]&lt;br&gt;
c.f. R. v. Crocker, [http://canlii.ca/t/fs5sw 2012 CanLII 42379] (NL PC)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Communications with Counsel Out of Court===
''Ex parte'' communications (i.e. communications in absence of one of the parties) concerning an ongoing proceedings should be avoided. It is a rule that relates to the &quot;public perception of fairness within the administration of justice&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Deleary, 2007 CanLII 71720 (ON SC) at para. 22&lt;/ref&gt; It also preserves &quot;confidence of the public in the impartiality of the judiciary and thereby in the administration of justice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R v Jones, 1996 CanLII 8006 (ON SC), (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 517 (Ont. G.D.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ex parte communications between judge and counsel concerning a case will &quot;almost invariably raise a reasonable apprehension of bias&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Deleary&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Intervention During Trial==
There is a presumption that a trial judge has intervened in a trial properly. The judge may often make comments, give directions or ask questions. &lt;ref&gt;Chippewas of Mnjikaning First Nation v. Chiefs of Ontario, 2010 ONCA 47, at para. 231&lt;/ref&gt; 
The key issue is whether the intervention affected trial fairness. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Valley 1996 (Ont. c.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; This is from the perspective of a reasonable observer. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Stucky [http://canlii.ca/t/22hv3 2009 ONCA 151]&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge may disrupt questioning in order to clear evidentiary ambiguities, pursue subjects left vague by the witness, and ask questions counsel should have asked.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Watson, [http://canlii.ca/t/1jd19 2004 CanLII 45443] (ON CA) at para. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Interlocutory remarks&quot; of the judge during argument are not &quot;judicial pronouncements&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Visscher, [http://canlii.ca/t/frt7v 2012 BCCA 290] (CanLII) at para. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge is permitted to give the jury mid-trial instructions to disregard any erroneous comments made by counsel. If it is given promptly and with explanation of why it should be disregarded, this can effectively correct any concern that a jury might misuse the information. &lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Normand (D.G.), [http://canlii.ca/t/5kkk 2002 MBCA 95] at para. 20, 166 Man.R. (2d) 179)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a presumption that an accused not be restrained while in court. It is upon the Crown to establish grounds to order the restaint of the accused.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. W.H.A., 2011 NSSC 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Unnecessary and repeated interruptions that disrupt the flow and effectiveness of cross-examination may exceed permissible limits.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Watson&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Exclusion of parties===
The trial judge can order the exclusion of the accused where his conduct makes the proceedings impractical.&lt;ref&gt;See s.650(2)(8); R. v. Pawliw, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/1985/1985canlii656/1985canlii656.html 1985 CanLII 656] (BCSC)&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused can likewise voluntarily be absent from the trial with the court's consent.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Drabinsky, [http://canlii.ca/t/208km 2008 CanLII 40225] (ON SC)&lt;/ref&gt; However, depending on how the proceedings go in the absence of the accused, there may be a ground of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Valeanu, [http://canlii.ca/t/6jwm 1995 CanLII 614] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Maintaining Order===

{{quotation|
'''Preserving order in court'''&lt;br&gt;
484. Every judge or provincial court judge has the same power and authority to preserve order in a court over which he presides as may be exercised by the superior court of criminal jurisdiction of the province during the sittings thereof.

R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 484; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 203.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec484 CCC]
}}

===Misc powers===
The judge does not have the power to order that counsel not communicate with a witness who is not in the middle of testimony. The rules of contempt of court and Professional Conduct are the only limitations on counsel's right to speak with witnesses and clients in court.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Arsenault, (1956) 115 CCC 400 (NBCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calling Witnesses==
The usual manner that a witness testify is by oral testimony in court (''viva voce'' evidence) while the accused is present. (CCC [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec650 s.650(1)])

The witnesses' testimony must be relevant, material, and admissible. To see details on the scope of these requirements see [[Canadian Criminal Evidence]].

==Choice of Witnesses==
Any party is entitled to call a witness who is competent to testify (See [[Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Testimonial_evidence]] for details on competency of witnesses).

A party is also permitted call a witness that has already previously been called by the opposing party.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cook, (1960), 31 W.W.R. 148 (Alta. S.C.A.D.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Baiton, [http://canlii.ca/t/5h3s 2001 SKQB 264]&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Sutton [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbqb/doc/2002/2002nbqb49/2002nbqb49.html 2002 NBQB 49]&lt;/ref&gt;

A party cannot call a witness for the sole purpose of discrediting a witness who has made a previous inconsistent statement.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Soobrian [http://canlii.ca/t/231tx 1994 CanLII 8739] (ONCA) &lt;Br&gt;
This relates mostly to crowns calling a witness apply under s. 9 CEA to cross examine (see [[Canadian_Criminal_Procedure_and_Practice/Trials/Examinations#Cross-examining a party's own witness (Adverse or Hostile Witnesses)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure to call a witness can be used to make an adverse inference where there is no plausible reason not o do so and it is well within the power of the party to do so. However, where the evidence is merely cumulative or inferior en it should not be taken into account. (R. v lapensee 2009 ONCA 646)

A failure to call a witness cannot be used to make a negative inference on credibility of the accused.&lt;ref&gt;
See [[Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Credibility#Failure_to_Call_Witnesses]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{reflist|2}}

==Testimonial Aids==

===Witness Screens===
On application by a prosecutor or witness, the judge may order that their testimony be heard either behind a screen or from a different room so that the witness cannot see the accused.

The governing section is 486.2 which states:
{{Quotation|
'''Testimony outside court room — witnesses under 18 or who have a disability'''&lt;br&gt;
486.2 (1) Despite section 650, in any proceedings against an accused, the judge or justice shall, on application of the prosecutor, of a witness who is under the age of eighteen years or of a witness who is able to communicate evidence but may have difficulty doing so by reason of a mental or physical disability, order that the witness testify outside the court room or behind a screen or other device that would allow the witness not to see the accused, unless the judge or justice is of the opinion that the order would interfere with the proper administration of justice.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Other witnesses'''&lt;Br&gt;
(2) Despite section 650, in any proceedings against an accused, the judge or justice may, on application of the prosecutor or a witness, order that the witness testify outside the court room or behind a screen or other device that would allow the witness not to see the accused if the judge or justice is of the opinion that the order is necessary to obtain a full and candid account from the witness of the acts complained of.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec486.2 CCC]
}}

===Video Testimony=== 
Section 714.1 of the Criminal Code allows a court to use “means of technology” to allow a witness to testify as a “virtual presence”.
{{quotation|
714.1 A court may order that a witness in Canada give evidence by means of technology that permits the witness to testify elsewhere in Canada in the virtual presence of the parties and the court, if the court is of the opinion that it would be appropriate in all the circumstances, including
:(a) the location and personal circumstances of the witness;
:(b) the costs that would be incurred if the witness had to be physically present; and
:(c) the nature of the witness’ anticipated evidence.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec714.1 CCC]
}}
 
The purpose of s. 714.1 is to &quot;address not only the high cost of litigation, but also the inconvenience of disruption to the lives of witnesses&quot; where the witnesses are outside of Canada. Consequently, the higher the cost and inconvenience harder it is to resist video link as an option.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Galandie, [2008] B.C.J. No. 79 (P.C.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1vq9f 2008 BCPC 6] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a presumption that the &quot;unless the circumstances warrant dispensing with the usual practice, the witness should be called to the witness stand to testify.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R v Chapple [http://canlii.ca/t/1k013 2005 BCSC 383] (CanLII) &lt;/ref&gt;
Section 714.1 &quot;does not replace the established procedure of calling witnesses to the witness stand in criminal cases or of allowing the accused to face his or her accuser&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
Chapple&lt;/ref&gt;

The court can do &quot;a sort of distance-cost, benefit-prejudice analysis&quot; to decide. Naturally, most applicants have witnesses that are in &quot;more remote regions of Canada.&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;R v Allen [2007] OJ No 1353 (ONCJ)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, &quot;cost saving to the state,...,in and of itself does not justify&quot; the use of video conferencing.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ross, [2007] B.C.J. No. 1753 (P.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Young, [http://canlii.org/en/sk/skqb/doc/2000/2000skqb419/2000skqb419.html 2000 SKQB 419] at para. 8 &lt;/ref&gt;
:1) will a video appearance by the witness impede or impact negatively on the ability of defence counsel to cross‑examine that witness?
:2) the nature of the evidence to be introduced from the witness and whether it is non‑controversial and not likely to attract any significant objection from defence counsel, for example various police and technical witnesses who testify to routine matters with respect to exhibits and the like and other matters that would not attract any particular objection on the part of the accused's counsel;
:3) the integrity of the examination site and the assurance that the witness will be as free from outside influences or interruptions as that person would be in a public courtroom;
:4) the distance the witness must travel to testify in person and the logistics of arranging for his or her personal appearance;
:5) the convenience of the witness and to what degree having to attend in person at a distant location may interfere with important aspects of the witness's life, such as his or her employment, personal life and the like;
:6) the ability of the witness to attend who lives in a country or area that makes it difficult to arrange for travel or travel in a reliable fashion;
:7) the cost to the state of having the witness attend in person; and
:8) a fact to consider also is that the witness is effectively beyond the control of the Court in the trial jurisdiction, and whatever powers a judge may have over such a person, they are certainly extraterritorial.

While the form of the order is at the discretion of the judge, the court should always order that witness be able to testify in a manner in which he can be seen, heard, and questioned by the parties. The court may also request the evidence only be given while the witness is in a courtroom and in the presence of a peace officer.&lt;Ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Osmond, [http://canlii.ca/t/283bh 2010 CanLII 6535] (NL PC) at para. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of Pseudonyms by Witnesses===
The Court has discretion to allow a witness to testify under a pseudonym only where a failure to do so would interfere with the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McKinnon, (1982), 39 A.R. 283 (Alta. C.A.);&lt;Br&gt; 
Attorney-General v. Leveller Magazine Ltd, [1979] 1 All E.R. 745 (H.L.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. McArthur, (1984) 13 C.C.C. (3d) 152 (Ont. H.C.J.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; This includes where the witness has reason to fear for their life.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gingras (1992), 120 A.R. 300 (C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Mousseau, 2002 ABQB 210&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
===Interpreters===
Every person charged with a crime has a right to the assistance of an interpreter where they cannot understand the English or French language.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [http://canlii.org/en/ca/charter_digest/s-14.html section 14]&lt;/ref&gt; This right requires that the interpreter be competent as an interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Rybak, [2008] O.J. No. 1715, at paragraph 84&lt;br&gt;R. v. Sidhu, [2005] O.J. No. 4881&lt;/ref&gt; 

This does not mean that s. 14 of the Charter extends guarantee to an accredited or certified interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Sidhu, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m14s 2005 CanLII 42491] (ON SC), (2005) 203 C.C.C. (3d) 17 at para. 298&lt;/ref&gt;
The interpreter must simply be competent and qualified court interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tran, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frqw 1994 CanLII 56] (SCC), (1994) 92, C.C.C. (3d) 218 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretation must be continuous, precise, impartial and contemporaneous. &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Wong, 2011 ONCJ 264 at para. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

See: R. v. Wong [2011] O.J. No. 2325

==Witness Problems and Issues==

===Refusal to Testify===

===Communicating with witnesses===
Counsel cannot talk to a witness between cross-examination and re-examination without asking for leave of the court. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Montgomery, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/1998/1998canlii3014/1998canlii3014.html 1998 CanLII 3014 (BC S.C.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A trial is the process by which a judge attempts to ascertain the truth in order to convict the guilty and acquit the innocent.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Levogiannis, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475 (&quot;The goal of the court process is truth seeking and, to that end, the evidence of all those involved in judicial proceedings must be given in a way that is most favourable to eliciting the truth.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nikolovski, [1996] 3 SCR 1197, (&quot;The ultimate aim of any trial, criminal or civil, must be to seek and to ascertain the truth.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. G. (B.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqlt 1999 CanLII 690] (SCC), [1999] 2 SCR 475 (&quot;[T]he essential principle of every criminal trial [is] the search for truth.&quot;)
&lt;/ref&gt;
The process does not go so far as to determine &quot;actual innocence&quot; as the standard of proof a trial is proof beyond reasonable doubt and does not evaluate degrees of acquittal and is not the ultimate purpose of criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Mullins-Johnson, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2007/2007onca720/2007onca720.html 2007 ONCA 720]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial fundamentally is &quot;about the search for the truth as well as fairness to the accused&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Handy, 2002 SCC 56 (&quot;[t]he  criminal  trial  is,  after  all,  about  the  search  for  truth  as  well fairness  to  an  accused&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;
This is guided by these principles:
#  the presumption of innocence&lt;ref&gt;R v Handy [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, 2002 SCC 56 at 44&lt;/ref&gt;
# the right against self-incrimination &lt;ref&gt; s. 11(d) of the Charter&lt;/ref&gt;
# the ultimate burden on the crown to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;Ref&gt;Section 11(c) of the Charter&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crown's Case==
The Crown will always be the first party to call evidence. It is expected that the crown will call all available witnesses that can provide evidence to establish the elements of the offences charged beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Crown is expected to call, as part of its case, evidence that may rebut any alibi evidence and evidence of similar facts.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Biddle [1995] 1 SCR 761&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Defence's Case==
At the end of the Crown's case the Defence will be permitted to either make a motion for directed verdict, elect to call evidence, or elect not to call evidence.

If the accused elects to call evidence, an opening statement may be given to introduce the trier-of-fact to the defence's case.

The defence has discretion on the order of the calling of witnesses.

If the accused does not call evidence, there will be no need for an opening statement. The case will proceed to closing statements beginning with the Crown's submissions.

{{reflist|2}}

==Reply or Rebuttal==
On closing of the crown's case, the crown is expected to have presented all relevant evidence available. The judge should not allow Crown to &quot;split&quot; it's case and present any part of its case after the defence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Melnichuk, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr30 1997 CanLII 383] (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 602
&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge may permit the crown to present further evidence at the close of the defence's case.

The evidence is limited only to matters that were raised in the defence evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Kuyan (1988) 43 CCC (#d) 339&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Crown evidence could have been reasonably anticipated as being relevant during the Crown's case then it should have been called then and should not be permitted to be called in rebuttal.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Perry (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 209 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
==Re-Opening the Case==
Once a party has closed their case, it is presumed they have finished presenting their evidence. It is the judge's discretion to allow a party, usually the crown, to re-open their case.

The factors to consider in exercising discretion to re-open a case prior to verdict are:&lt;ref&gt;
R v Hayward (1993) 86 CCC (3d) 193 at para. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt;
#whether the evidence is relevant to a material issue in the case;
#the potential prejudice to the other party, if reopening is permitted; and
#the effect of permitting reopening on the orderly and expeditious conduct of the trial.

The main consideration is the potential prejudice to the opposing side by re-opening the case.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Hayward, (1993) 86 CCC (3d) 193 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

The test to re-open the defence's case is more stringent post-conviction in order &quot;to protect the integrity of the process, including the enhanced interest in finality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Kowall 1996 CanLII 411 (ON CA), (1996), 92 O.A.C. 82, 108 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at para. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
In such cases the test will be the same for admitting fresh evidence on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;See R. v. Palmer, 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, cited by Kowall at para. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Re-opening the Crown's Case===
The judge may consider an application by the Crown to reopen their case. The standard will depend on what stage in the trial the application is made.&lt;ref&gt;
Robillard v. The Queen, 1978 CanLII 200 (SCC), [1978] 2 S.C.R. 728&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. P. (M.B.), 1994 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. G. (S.G.), 1997 CanLII 311 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716&lt;br&gt;
See also R. E. Salhany, Q.C., Canadian Criminal Procedure, 6th ed., looseleaf (Aurora:  Thomson Reuters Canada Limited, 2010) vol. 1 at paras. 6.3975, 6.3980, 6.3990&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge has discretion to reopen the case &quot;to correct some oversight or to prove a matter which it had failed to do inadvertently, provided that there was no prejudice to the accused.&quot; However, &quot;[o]nce the defence had begun to present its case, the judge’s discretion [is] narrowly restricted&quot; and may only be reopened &quot;to prove a matter, ex improviso, which no human ingenuity could have foreseen.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt; Salhany&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Section 276 is an exclusionary rule of evidence prohibiting any party from adducing evidence of past sexual activity of a complainant in a sexual offence proceedings for certain uses. 

The section states:
{{quotation|
'''Evidence of complainant’s sexual activity'''&lt;br&gt;
276. (1) In proceedings in respect of an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or (3) or section 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272 or 273, evidence that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity, whether with the accused or with any other person, is not admissible to support an inference that, by reason of the sexual nature of that activity, the complainant
:(a) is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge; or
:(b) is less worthy of belief.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Idem'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) In proceedings in respect of an offence referred to in subsection (1), no evidence shall be adduced by or on behalf of the accused that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity other than the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, whether with the accused or with any other person, unless the judge, provincial court judge or justice determines, in accordance with the procedures set out in sections 276.1 and 276.2, that the evidence
:(a) is of specific instances of sexual activity;
:(b) is relevant to an issue at trial; and
:(c) has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 276; R.S., 1985, c. 19 (3rd Supp.), s. 12; 1992, c. 38, s. 2; 2002, c. 13, s. 13.

}}
The section was enacted in response to the decision of R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577.

The exclusionary rule can be broken down into three components to be engaged:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. M.T., [http://canlii.ca/t/fs52f 2012 ONCA 511] at para. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
* offence charged
* subject-matter
* purpose

{{reflist|2}}
==Offence Charged==
The applicable offences are listed in s. 276*1) as consisting of 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or (3) or section 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272 or 273.

{{reflist|2}}

==Applicable Subject Matter==
Section 276 applies to prior sexual acts consisting of &quot;Evidence ... that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity other than the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, whether with the accused or with any other person.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Section 276(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
This includes sexual acts that occur in the moments before the alleged sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. S. (D.R.), 1999 ABQB 330 (CanLII) [http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/1999/1999abqb330/1999abqb330.html] at 19&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Silva, 1994 CanLII 4673 (SK CA) at 33 [http://canlii.org/en/sk/skca/doc/1994/1994canlii4673/1994canlii4673.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Purpose==
Section 276(1) prohibits evidence of prior sexual conduct where it is used to make prohibited general inferences. These inference is known as the &quot;dual myths&quot;, summarized as inferring &quot;that unchaste women were more likely to consent to intercourse and in any event, were less worthy of belief&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577 at p.386&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. M.M., [1999] O.J. No. 3943 (S.C.J.) at para. 19&lt;br&gt;
R. v. M.T., [http://canlii.ca/t/fs52f 2012 ONCA 511] at para. 32&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the purpose of the evidence does not touch on the two &quot;myths&quot;, then the exclusionary rule does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. M.T., [http://canlii.ca/t/fs52f 2012 ONCA 511] at para. 32&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 276(2) sets out the exception to the rule permitting extrinsic evidence of sexual activity to be admitted where it:&lt;ref&gt;R v MT 2012 ONCA 511 at para. 33&lt;/ref&gt;
* is of specific instances of sexual activity;
* is relevant to an issue at trial; and
* has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.

When considering whether evidence meets these requirements the courts must consider the factors set out in s.276(3). 

{{reflist|2}}

===Factors===

{{quotation|
276...&lt;br&gt;
'''Factors that judge must consider'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) In determining whether evidence is admissible under subsection (2), the judge, provincial court judge or justice shall take into account
:(a) the interests of justice, including the right of the accused to make a full answer and defence;
:(b) society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual assault offences;
:(c) whether there is a reasonable prospect that the evidence will assist in arriving at a just determination in the case;
:(d) the need to remove from the fact-finding process any discriminatory belief or bias;
:(e) the risk that the evidence may unduly arouse sentiments of prejudice, sympathy or hostility in the jury;
:(f) the potential prejudice to the complainant’s personal dignity and right of privacy;
:(g) the right of the complainant and of every individual to personal security and to the full protection and benefit of the law; and
:(h) any other factor that the judge, provincial court judge or justice considers relevant.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 276; R.S., 1985, c. 19 (3rd Supp.), s. 12; 1992, c. 38, s. 2; 2002, c. 13, s. 13.
&lt;p&gt;
|[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec276 CCC]
}}

Evidence of extrinsic sexual activity of the complainant is &quot;rarely ... relevant to support a denial that sexual activity took place or to establish consent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; 
R v Darrach, [http://canlii.ca/t/523t 2000 SCC 46] (CanLII), [2000] 2 SCR 443 at para. 58&lt;/ref&gt;


Whether the complainant has previously been sexually assaulted is irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. B. (A.R.) 1998 CanLII 14603 (ON CA), (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 361 (C.A.), at p. 365, aff’d 2000 SCC 30 (CanLII), 2000 SCC 30, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 781&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Significant probative value'''&lt;br&gt; 
The ''significant probative value'' standard places a greater threshold on relevance for the admission of prior sexual history evidence. It is intended to prohibit evidence that may be of trifling relevance. Regardless of the purpose of the evidence, sexual history evidence can tend to bring the administration of justice to disrepute.&lt;ref&gt; Darrach at 40&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Significant&quot; must be 
read in light of the requirement of having &quot;full answer and defence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; Darrach&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Evidence related to credibility and consent===
Evidence advanced to make an inference supported by an established myth is prohibited.  Any other inferences directed to credibility and consent may be argued as admissible. &lt;ref&gt;Ecker (1995), 96 C.C.C.(3d) 161(C.A.), &lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have suggested that the prohibition should focus on &quot;general&quot; inference that are focused on attacking character of the complainant.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Paciocco, &quot;The New Rape Shield Provisions In Section 276 Should Survive Charter Challenge&quot; (1993), 21 C.R.(4th) 223&lt;/ref&gt; Some courts have adopted this in an attempt to reconcile s.276(1) and (2). &lt;ref&gt;Harper (1995), 137 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 77 (P.E.I.S.C.), rev’d on other grounds (1997), 149 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 295 (P.E.I.C.A.), &lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence has been admitted in the following scenarios:
* where the defence wanted to lead evidence of a romantic relationship between the accused and complainant where the complainant characterized it as platonic.&lt;ref&gt;Harris (1997), 118 C.C.C.(3d) 498 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence has been found inadmissible in the following scenarios:
* A sex toy party earlier in the day held by the victim constitutes sexual activity and is not relevant to the allegations so is not admissible.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McDonald, 2003 SKQB 165&lt;/reF&gt;

==Procedure==

{{quotation|
'''Application for hearing'''&lt;br&gt;
276.1 (1) Application may be made to the judge, provincial court judge or justice by or on behalf of the accused for a hearing under section 276.2 to determine whether evidence is admissible under subsection 276(2).
&lt;p&gt;
'''Form and content of application'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) An application referred to in subsection (1) must be made in writing and set out
:(a) detailed particulars of the evidence that the accused seeks to adduce, and
:(b) the relevance of that evidence to an issue at trial, and a copy of the application must be given to the prosecutor and to the clerk of the court.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Jury and public excluded'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) The judge, provincial court judge or justice shall consider the application with the jury and the public excluded.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Judge may decide to hold hearing'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Where the judge, provincial court judge or justice is satisfied
:(a) that the application was made in accordance with subsection (2),
:(b) that a copy of the application was given to the prosecutor and to the clerk of the court at least seven days previously, or such shorter interval as the judge, provincial court judge or justice may allow where the interests of justice so require, and
:(c) that the evidence sought to be adduced is capable of being admissible under subsection 276(2), the judge, provincial court judge or justice shall grant the application and hold a hearing under section 276.2 to determine whether the evidence is admissible under subsection 276(2).
&lt;p&gt;

}}

For a helpful summary of the procedure to follow, see: R. v. Strickland, [2007] O.J. 517 at 20.

The judge must hold a hearing to determine if the evidence of prior sexual history is admissible.&lt;ref&gt;see Darrach, Sheppard &lt;/ref&gt;
Failure to hold such a hearing is an error in law.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Wright, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftb6t 2012 ABCA 306] (CanLII) at 10 and s.276.5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|
'''Jury and public excluded'''&lt;br&gt;
276.2 (1) At a hearing to determine whether evidence is admissible under subsection 276(2), the jury and the public shall be excluded.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Complainant not compellable'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The complainant is not a compellable witness at the hearing.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Judge’s determination and reasons'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge, provincial court judge or justice shall determine whether the evidence, or any part thereof, is admissible under subsection 276(2) and shall provide reasons for that determination, and
:(a) where not all of the evidence is to be admitted, the reasons must state the part of the evidence that is to be admitted;
:(b) the reasons must state the factors referred to in subsection 276(3) that affected the determination; and
:(c) where all or any part of the evidence is to be admitted, the reasons must state the manner in which that evidence is expected to be relevant to an issue at trial.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Record of reasons'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The reasons provided under subsection (3) shall be entered in the record of the proceedings or, where the proceedings are not recorded, shall be provided in writing.
&lt;P&gt;
1992, c. 38, s. 2.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec276.2 CCC]
}}

Nor was there compliance with subsections 276.2(3) and (4), which require the judge to provide written reasons for a decision that the evidence is or is not admissible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Similar fact evidence is &quot;presumptively inadmissible. The onus is on the prosecution to satisfy the trial judge on the balance of probabilities that in the context of the particular case the probative value of the evidence in relation to a particular issue outweighs its potential prejudice and thereby justifies its reception.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Handy&lt;br&gt;
The Law of Evidence, by David M. Paciocco and Lee Stuesser, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2008) at page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

When assessing the similarities of incidents in a similar fact evidence application, the court should consider:&lt;ref&gt;e.g., R. v. Arp, [1998] 3 SCR 339 [http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii769/1998canlii769.html] at para. 50;&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 SCR 908 [http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc56/2002scc56.html] at para. 82;&lt;Br&gt;
Watt’s Manual of Criminal Evidence, Thomson Reuters, 2010, at p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;
#the temporal proximity of the incidents;
#the physical or spatial proximity of the events; 
#the similarity in detail between the various acts;
#the number of putatively similar acts;
#the circumstances surrounding the incidents at issue;
#distinctive features unifying the incidents; and
#the occurrence and nature of any intervening events.

The risk of &quot;moral prejudice&quot; refers to risks of the evidence being used to draw a prohibited inference that the accused is the kind of person likely to the commit the offence charged.&lt;ref&gt;Handy&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of &quot;reasoning prejudice&quot; includes risks such as:&lt;ref&gt;Handy&lt;/ref&gt;
* The trier of fact may be distracted from deciding the issue in a reasoned way because of the inflammatory nature of the proposed evidence
* The trier of facts may become confused about what evidence pertains to the crime charged and what evidence relates to the similar fact
* The trial will begin to focus disproportionately on whether the similar act happened
* The accused will be unable to respond to the allegation that the similar act occurred because of the passage of time, surprise or the collateral nature of the inquiry

Reasoning and moral prejudice are considered less of a concern for trials by judge alone than trial by jury.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. B.(T.), [2009] O.J. No. 751 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Probative Value==

===Collusion===
Potential inadvertent collusion through rumors and media accounts may occur and should not by itself exclude similar fact evidence. However, such occurrence should go to the weight.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Dorsey, 2012 ONCA 185 (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}
===Similarities Between Acts===

What would be called &quot;generic similarities&quot; are to be given less consideration. The risk of &quot;relying 
primarily on generic similarities&quot; to support evidence establishing the actus reus includes the risk that the &quot;initial inference arising from the prior conduct becomes so general, that it approaches bad personhood&quot; and also the risk the accused's &quot;non-specific character, generic similarities may mask underlying dissimilarities that could be important in a particular case.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Blake 2003 CanLII 13682 (ON CA), (2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 169, affirmed 2004 SCC 69 (CanLII), (2004), 188 C.C.C. (3d) 428 (S.C.C.) at para 64&lt;br&gt;

The burden of proof indicates who has the responsibility or onus to prove something.

Generally, there are two types of burdens. First, there is the &quot;burden of pursuasion&quot;, often called a &quot;legal burden&quot;, &quot;primary burden&quot;, or &quot;major burden&quot;, which is the requirement to prove the case or disprove the defence. Failure to discharge this burden results in the party losing the case. This type of evidence typically is said to impose a &quot;onus of proof&quot;. Second, there is the &quot;evidential burden&quot;, often called the &quot;secondary burden&quot;, &quot;burden of going forward&quot;, or &quot;minor burden&quot;, which is the requirement of putting an issue before the court using the available evidence.  

{{reflist|2}}

==Presumption of Innocence==
It is well established in law that all persons are entitled to the legal presumption of innocence for all charges they are not convicted for.&lt;ref&gt;
Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] AC 462 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Appleby, [1972] SCR 303 [http://canlii.ca/t/1nfms] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Proudlock, [1979] 1 SCR 525 [http://canlii.ca/t/1mktb#par6 at para. 6]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore the Crown has the burden of proving all the elements of the offence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lauer, [http://canlii.ca/t/fkdt0#par73 2011 PECA 5 at para. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;
The onus of proving guilt never switches from the Crown to the accused.&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Briand (2010), 258 C.C.C. (3d) 416 (N.L.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;The “accused bears no burden to explain why his accuser made the allegations against him”&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. J.C.H., 2011 NLCA 8 at para 18&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The standard of proof asks to how convinced the trier of fact must be of some something.  Canadian criminal law has three core standards:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Proudlock [http://canlii.ca/t/1mktb 1978 CanLII 15 (SCC)], [1979] 1 S.C.R. 525&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Proof beyond a reasonable doubt''' which is the standard to be met by the Crown against the accused;
#'''a balance of probabilities''' or '''Proof on a preponderance of the evidence''' which is the burden of proof on the accused when he has to meet a presumption requiring him to establish or to prove a fact or an excuse;
#'''Evidence raising a reasonable doubt''' which is what is required to overcome any other presumption of fact or of law. Once a prima facie case has been established by the evidence of the crown, there is no need to prove innocence. Rather the accused need only raise a doubt in the evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;Batary v. Attorney General of Saskatchewan [1965] SCR 465, [http://canlii.ca/t/227rg 1965 CanLII 102 (SCC)], at p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;

The US has a fourth standard known as &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; which is a middle ground between the two standards, however, this has never been officially adopted in Canada. When a proposition at issue in a case, such as an element of an offence, must be proven, the standard must be reached using the weight of the totality of evidence presented, not on each individual piece of evidence &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Morin [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftc2 1988 CanLII 8] (SCC), [1988] 2 SCR 345&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{reflist|2}}

==Balance of Probabilities==
The &quot;balance of probabilities&quot; is described as being &quot;more probable than not&quot;, or more technically, the chance of the proposition being true is more than 50%. This standard is known as the civil standard as it exclusively used in civil trial cases.&lt;ref&gt;
Continental Insurance Co. v. Dalton Cartage Co., [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpbl 1982 CanLII 13] (SCC), [1982] 1 SCR 164 - SCC rejected a variable standard, adopting only balance of probabilities&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (BARD)==
The standard of &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; (BARD) is a common law standard of proof in criminal matters.&lt;Ref&gt;
affirmed under the English common law of England in Woolmington v. D.P.P., [1935] A.C. 462 at 481-82 (H.L.)&lt;/ref&gt;
This standard is exclusively used in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. This includes not only adult criminal trials, but also young offender cases, adult sentencing, and certain provincial penal offences.

The standard of &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; consists of a doubt based on reason and common sense which must be logically based upon the  evidence or lack of evidence. It is not based on &quot;sympathy or prejudice&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lifchus, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqzt 1997 CanLII 319] (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320 at para. 36&lt;br&gt;
See also:  In R. v. J.M.H., [http://canlii.ca/t/fnbb2 2011 SCC 45]  at 39 ( “a reasonable doubt does not need to be based on the evidence; it may arise from an absence of evidence or a simple failure of the evidence to persuade the trier of fact to the requisite level of beyond reasonable doubt.”) &lt;/ref&gt; 

Proof beyond a reasonable doubt &quot;it does not involve proof to an absolute certainty; it is not proof beyond any doubt nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt.&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;
Lifchus, at para. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, belief that the accused is &quot;probably guilty&quot; is not sufficient and must acquit.&lt;ref&gt;
Lifcus at para. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard as the ultimate burden of proof is &quot;inextricably intertwined with that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the presumption of innocence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lifchus at para. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The burden should never shift to the accused.&lt;ref&gt;Lifchus at para. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden of proof placed upon the Crown lies “much closer to absolute certainty than to a balance of probabilities.”&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Starr, [http://canlii.ca/t/525l 2000 SCC 40] at para 242&lt;/ref&gt; The standard is more &quot;than proof that the accused is probably guilty&quot; in which case the judge must acquit.&lt;ref&gt; Lifchus at 36&lt;/ref&gt;

“[A] reasonable doubt does not need to be based on the evidence; it may arise from an absence of evidence or a simple failure of the evidence to persuade the trier of fact to the requisite level of beyond reasonable doubt.”&lt;ref&gt;R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45&lt;/ref&gt;  

The standard of BARD only applies to the evaluation of the evidence as a whole and not individual aspects of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
Stewart v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1z6bm 1976 CanLII 202], [1977] 2 S.C.R. 748 at 759-61&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Morin, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftc2 1988 CanLII 8], [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345 at 354, 44 C.C.C. (3d) 193&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. White, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqqt 1998 CanLII 789], [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, 125 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at paras. 38-41&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasonable doubt must come as a rational conclusion from the evidence available and not as a basis of conjecture.&lt;Ref&gt; 
R. v. Wild [http://canlii.ca/t/1xd3d 1970 CanLII 148] (SCC), [1971] SCR 101 at 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the issue is the reliability or credibility of a witness, the courts must generally consider corroborative evidence.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Kehler, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ggzb 2004 SCC 11], [2004] 1 S.C.R. 328 at paras. 12-23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Sufficiency of Proof ==
Before any evidence gets to a trier of fact there is often a requirement to discharge an evidential burden for the trier of law (i.e. the judge).

In a preliminary inquiry the Crown must show on the whole that the evidence they will present is sufficient to potentially convict the accused. The purpose of this initial evaluation is to avoid frivolous suiting being brought in that have no chance at success. 

The leading case for the standard of proof needed before evidence can be put to the jury is United States of America v. Shephard, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mx51 1976 CanLII 8] (SCC), [1977] 2 SCR 1067. The Court held that: 
:''[The] which governs a trial Judge in decideing whether the evidence is sufficient to justify him in withdrawing the case from the jury, and this is to be determined according to whether or not there is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilt.''

In a case where some of the evidence the Crown is relying upon is not directly to the issue of the case, the Crown must satisfy the judge that &quot;the evidnece, ''if believed'', could reasonably support an inference of guilt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R.v. Arcuri, [http://canlii.ca/t/51xv2001 SCC 54] (CanLII), [2001] 2 SCR 828&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
== Legal Proof ==

Frequently seen standards of proof that are seen include:
#&quot;air of reality&quot; / prima facie case
#reasonable and probable grounds / reasonably-based probability 
#reasonable suspicion

===Air of Reality Test===

The air of reality test determines whether a particular legal defence should be consider by the trier-of-fact. When the standard is met, the effect is to add a burden upon the Crown to prove that the defence fails beyond a reasonable doubt.

In the context of a jury trial, the test determines whether the judge will give instructions to the jury that they should consider the particular defenses. .

The air of reality test creates a burden of evidence, not a persuasive burden.&lt;Ref&gt;
Cinous at para. 52 (&quot;It is trite law that the air of reality test imposes a burden on the accused that is merely evidential, rather than persuasive.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

The test applies to ''all'' defences&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cinous, [http://canlii.ca/t/51tb 2002 SCC 29] (CanLII), [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3 at para. 57 and 82&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as all elements of each defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ribic, [http://canlii.ca/t/21mq8 2008 ONCA 790] at para. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury should be instructed of defences that have evidence supporting it.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ribic, at para. 38 (all defences &quot;that are realistically available on the evidence&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
Cinous, at para. 50 (“a defence should be put to a jury if and only if there is an evidential foundation for it”)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
By inference, a judge &quot;judge has a positive duty to keep from the jury defences lacking an evidential foundation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Gunning, [2005 SCC 27 2005 SCC 27] (CanLII), [2005] 1 S.C.R. 627, at para. 29
&lt;/ref&gt;
There must be evidence support ''each'' element of the defence.&lt;ref&gt;
Ribic at para. 38 (&quot;if evidential support for a necessary element of a defence is lacking, the air of reality test will not be met.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

The test requires that there must be &quot;some evidence&quot; upon which &quot;a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could base an acquittal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Cinous, at para. 83&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision of a judge on the air of reality test may be reviewed as a &quot;question of law&quot; on a standard of &quot;correctness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McRae 2005 CanLII 26592 (ON CA) at para. 38 (&quot;[T]he question of whether there was an air of reality to the defence of duress is an issue of law&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
Cinous at para. 55&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Ryan, 2011 NSCA 30 (CanLII) at para. 114&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge should not consider credibility, make findings of fact, draw inferences, or &quot;weigh&quot; the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
Cinous at para. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
He should not consider the likelihood of success of the defence.&lt;ref&gt;
Cinous at para. 54 (&quot;whether the defence is likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely to succeed at the end of the day&quot;)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge must consider whether inferences would be necessary for the defence to succeed and whether those inferences from the evidence are reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;
Cinous at para. 65 and 83&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Savoury 2005 CanLII 25884 (ON CA) at para. 45&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Basit, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvq6d 2013 BCSC 70] (CanLII) at para. 7&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior space projects have relied on a '''Mission''' concept of operations.  That is you plan a mission ahead of time, with a detailed timeline of all the steps you expect to perform.  Then the crew and ground controllers execute the plan.  If deviations happen, corrective action is taken to return to the plan as much as possible.  This concept works for a single mission in isolation with a well defined goal.  Future projects will have multiple activities in multiple locations, with larger numbers of people involved and interactions between activities.  So planning every step ahead of time in a linear fashion becomes difficult if not impossible.  For cost reasons, you also want to reduce the large amount of planning and training that currently goes on relative to the actual doing.

{{TOC right}}

==Operations Concepts==

For future projects, rather than planning everything in advance, one approach is to develop building blocks of tasks which can then be assembled as needed to reach a goal.  As new feedback comes in from other tasks, the building blocks can be adjusted or replaced as needed.  Changing plans may not be as efficient as carrying out a fully detailed plan made in advance, but the effort to make those advance plans may be larger than the efficiency loss.  The ability to change or replace tasks, rather than a monolithic preplanned mission, also allows continuing operations to adapt and improve over time.

==Operations Tasks==

===Debris Removal===

This task is the removal of human-made orbital debris, and, if possible, natural hazardous objects.  Over time, debris will collide with itself and decay from drag.  In the long term it will clean itself up, but in the short term the collisions will generate more hazardous size pieces, which is an unsatisfactory situation.  Besides clean up of past debris, this task takes care of cleaning up future defunct, lost, or destroyed hardware.  There are a number of methods which have been proposed to do this, none of which have been demonstrated yet:

* A &quot;plasma-puffer&quot;, promoted by Daniel Gregory. That would use an arc discharge from a high altitude balloon to puff air upwards in the path of the junk, making it de-orbit faster.
* Ballistic puffer, which launches a projectile from a very large gun, that releases air or some other material in the path of the debris, having the same effect. The projectile is sub-orbital, so it does not add to the space junk problem.
* Lasers - zap the front of the debris, blasting off some of it, and slowing it down from the reaction.
* Drag devices - attach a large sail or conducting wire to the space junk and make it slow down faster
* Orbital tug - goes from orbit to orbit collecting junk. This requires high efficiency electric thrusters or the fuel used gets absurdly high.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Elements==
In a Criminal trial, the crown will present evidence that will tend to establish the offence charged. Each offence in the Criminal Code is broken down into &quot;elements&quot; that comprise the offence. Each element must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before a judge can consider making a verdict of guilt.

The elements of each offence are unique for each offence. For a list of elements of major offences, see [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences]]. Common with all criminal offences in Canada are the basic requirements of an action or omission (known as the &quot;''actus reus''&quot;) and a criminal intent (known as the &quot;''mens rea''&quot;). What constitutes a ''actus reus'' and ''mens rea'' depends on the offence itself. For example, a drug possession charge requires proving ''mens rea'' by establishing that the accused had knowledge of the presence of the substance on their person. An assault, however, requires proving a ''mens rea'' by establishing intended the application of force.    

There are more static elements that need to be proven, such as the identity of the accused as the person subject to the offence, jurisdiction of the court over the person accused, and the timing of the offence.  Identity can sometimes be a non-trivial issue where the accused was not caught in the act. Courts are very wary of wrongful convictions based on identity. The jurisdiction and time elements simply establish that the court is able to adjudicate the matter. Judges cannot concern themselves of offences outside of the province or offences without any specific time period.

Where defences are concerned, the Crown has no obligation to disprove them unless the evidence provides an &quot;air of reality&quot; to the availability of a defence.

{{Quotation|
'''Correction of child by force'''&lt;br&gt;
43. Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances.
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., c. C-34, s. 43.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec43 CCC]}} 

Section 43, sets out three requirements&lt;REf&gt;R. v. Gervin, [http://canlii.ca/t/fq3sq 2012 MBQB 44] at para 5&lt;Br&gt;
see also R. v. Sinclair 2008 MBCA 15&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
#The force must have been intended for corrective purposes. 
#The child must have been capable from benefiting from the correction.
#The force used must have been objectively reasonable under the circumstances.
 
The first requirement implies that the actions of the child called for corrective action.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Accident==
An accident is a &quot;mishap or untoward event not expected or designed&quot;, or &quot;unforeseen contingency or occurence&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
R v Whitehorne [http://canlii.ca/t/1lp2r 2005 CanLII 34553] (NLPC)&lt;Br&gt;
Hill v. R., [http://canlii.ca/t/1twzh 1973 CanLII 36], [1975] 2 SCR 402, (1974) 14 CCC (2d) 505 (SCC) at p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;
It's meaning varies depending on the type of charge. Where it is a specific intent offence, an accident relates to a denial of voluntariness of the act or denial of intention to cause the outcome. General intent offence claims the act was unexpected or chance that was not foreseeable. &lt;ref&gt;
Criminal Pleading &amp; Practice, Ewaschuck, (2nd Edition) at para. 21.0030&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Mathisen, [http://canlii.ca/t/21dw7 2008 ONCA 747] at 70&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect in law is that the mens rea is not present. This is distinctive from mistake which occurs in “the realm of perception”.&lt;ref&gt; R v Whitehorne &lt;/ref&gt;

Once the accused establishes there is an &quot;air of reality&quot; to the defence, the crown must disprove the availability of the defence. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Sutherland, [http://canlii.ca/t/20t70 1993 CanLII 6614] (SK CA), (1994) 84 CCC (3d) 484 (Sask. C.A.) per Vanscise, J.A., at pp. 497-498&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Reflex==
It is permissible to argue that the action of accused was not voluntary as it was a reflexive act.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==De Minimus Principle==
The principle of ''de minimus non curat lex'' excludes certain acts from criminal sanctions due to their trivial nature. The principle is based on the premise that the law should not concern itself with trifling matters. 

In general, the least touching of another person without their consent constitutes an assault.&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Dawydiuk (2010), 253 C.C.C. (3d) 493, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2010/2010bcca162/2010bcca162.html 2010 BCCA 162]&lt;/ref&gt;  The strength of the force is immaterial to consideration of guilt. &lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Palombi (2007), 222 C.C.C. (3d) 528 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle cannot be applied in the context of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Downey, 2002 NSSC 226 at para. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence can be invoked in relation to the possession of drugs where the amounts alleged are merely residual particles of a controlled substance. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Marusiak, 2002 ABQB 774&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-consensual touching that amounts to an assault that it was trivial is subject to the legal maxim ''de minimus non curat lex''.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Juneja,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2009/2009oncj572/2009oncj572.html 2009 ONCJ 572]&lt;br&gt;
R v Hinchey (1996) 111 CCC 3d 353 (SCC) at P 380-81 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Light strikes can fall within the meaning of trifling.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Merasty, 2002 SKPC 86, R. v. Wiebe, 2001 SKQB 389&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">
==General Principles==
Certain offences mandate higher penalties where there is a prior conviction for the offence. The higher penalty can only be sought where the Crown has given notice of their intention to seek greater punishment.

Offences for which this applies include:
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Use of Firearm in Commission of an Offence|use firearm]] (s. 85) 
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Unsafe Storage of a Firearm|careless storage of a firearm]] (86)
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Possession of Unauthorized Firearm|possession firearm]] (92) 
* betting, pool-selling, bookmaking (202)
* placing bets on other’s behalf (203)
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Impaired Driving and Over 80|impaired driving and over 80]] (253)
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Refusal|refusal]] (254)

By failing to give proper notice the Crown cannot rely upon the legislated mandatory minimums. However, a judge may still consider the prior record when sentencing and can impose the mandatory minimum as long as it is in the range of sentence.&lt;reF&gt;
R v Norris, (1988) 41 C.C.C. (3d) 441 (N.W.T.C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Notice==
Notice of increased penalty is governed by s. 727(1):      
{{quotation|              
727. (1) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), where an accused or a defendant is convicted of an offence for which a greater punishment may be imposed by reason of previous convictions, no greater punishment shall be imposed on him by reason thereof unless the prosecutor satisfies the court that the accused or defendant, before making his plea, was notified that a greater punishment would be sought by reason thereof.
|[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec727 CCC]}}

Section 727(1) does not specifically require written notice, thus, both written or verbal notice is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;R v Collini (1979) 3 MVR 218 (Ont HCJ)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is divided cases on whether the accused must be served personally or whether service on the agent or counsel is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Beaulieu;  R. v. Lepine (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 189 (Que. S.C.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
The dominant opinion however has been that service of notice upon counsel is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of s.727(1) and that personal service is not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Fowler, (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 227 (NSCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Simms, (1986), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 350 (NLCA)&lt;BR&gt;
R. v. Godon, (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 446, (SKCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Van Boeyen, 1996 CanLII 8372 (BC CA)&lt;bR&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
In select jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, it has been determined that service upon an agent, including a relative, is also sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Godon, (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 446, (SKCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not sufficient to notify the accused that the Crown “may” be seeking a greater punishment.&lt;Ref&gt;
R .  v. Riley (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 245 (Ont. High Ct.) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary to notify the accused of the nature and character of the penalty sought, including the length of the possible jail sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Bear (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 462 (Sask C.A.) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no need for “reasonable notice”. So notice can be given on the day of trial.&lt;ref&gt;R v Bufford (1988) 46 CCC (3d) 116 (Ont.DC)&lt;/reF&gt;

Notice must be given to the accused of the Crown's intention to seek a greater penalty for past offences.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Zaccaria, 2005 ABCA 130 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2005/2005abca130/2005abca130.html]; R. v. Veinot (1983), NSCA__&lt;/ref&gt;


Although it is generally practiced, it is not necessary to specify the previous convictions being relied upon when giving notice.&lt;ref&gt;R v Pidlubny (1973) 10 CCC (2d) 178 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two lines of cases on the issue of whether the notice is discretionary on the judge to accept. This turns on whether the notice is part of the core prosecutorial duties which are not reviewable by a court absent evidence of abuse of process or bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Haneveld 2008 ABPC 382 - not reviewable by court&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Gill,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc1145/2011onsc1145.html 2011 ONSC 1145] - reviewable by court&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Cases is support of the crown discretion view suggests that to do otherwise would create too much second guessing and erode the boundary between the separatoin of powers.&lt;ref&gt; R v Mohla [2012] OJ No. 388 at 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the crown does not serve proper notice under s. 727, then the accused cannot be said to have been convicted &quot;of an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment&quot; under s.742.1, and so would not disqualify the offender from being subject to a conditional sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Demchuk, [http://canlii.ca/t/l0l 2003 CanLII 15723] (ON CA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Post-Sentence evidence */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Evidence==
The admissibility of evidence is significantly different in a sentencing hearings than in trials. The interests at stake differ in a sentencing as opposed to a trial as the presumption of innocence is gone and there is no longer a concern for a wrongful conviction.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Angelillo, [http://canlii.ca/t/1q3xt 2006 SCC 55] (CanLII), [2006] 2 SCR 728 such as at para. 30
&lt;/ref&gt;

In sentencing, courts should be open to a broad range of information in order to achieve the objectives under the Code.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jones, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frtc 1994 CanLII 85] (SCC), [1994] 2 SCR 229 at p.396 (&quot;...both the public interest in safety and the general sentencing interest of developing the most appropriate penalty for the particular offender dictate the greatest possible range of information on which to make an accurate evaluation of the ganger posed by the offender.&quot;) and at p. 398 (&quot;sentencing judge is to obtain the accurate assessment of the offender that is necessary to develop an appropriate sentence, he will have to have at his disposal the broadest possible range of information.&quot;( &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the evidence must still meet the standard of accuracy, credibility and reliability.&lt;Ref&gt;
McWilliams' Canadian Criminal Evidence, Fourth Edition at 34:10&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lévesque, [http://canlii.ca/t/523w 2000 SCC 47] (CanLII), [2000] 2 SCR 487 at para. 30&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Campbell, [http://canlii.ca/t/f6k 2003 CanLII 49352] (ON SC) at para. 31&lt;br&gt;
Angelillo  at para. 20
&lt;/ref&gt;

The prejudicial effect of the evidence should not outweigh the probative value.&lt;ref&gt;
Angelillo at para. 32&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Edwards, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fbx6 2001 CanLII 24105] (ON CA) at para. 63
Campbell&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Exclusionary rules of evidence are not applied strictly in sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;
Campbell at para. 29, 31, 32&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Boyd, [http://canlii.ca/t/23m12 1983 CanLII 240] (BC CA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Admissibility voir dires, such as for voluntariness, may be held but are not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;
Campbell at para. 9&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1996, Part XXIII was amended to create a statutory framework for sentencing hearings.&lt;ref&gt;
Angelillo, such as at para. 21
&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of evidence at sentencing equally applies to dangerous and long term offenders.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Johnson, [http://canlii.ca/t/51pl 2003 SCC 46] (CanLII), [2003] 2 SCR 357 at para. 23
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Character Evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
Character evidence is admissible and relevant to sentencing.&lt;Ref&gt;
Edwards at para.39-42&lt;br&gt;
Angelillo at para. 28, 29 &lt;/ref&gt; Character evidence may be excluded where fairness would outweigh the probative value.&lt;ref&gt;Angelillo at para. 32&lt;Br&gt;
Ewards at para. 63
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factual findings===
Section 723 codifies the common law rules on submission of evidence on sentencing.

{{quotation|
'''Submissions on facts'''&lt;br&gt;
723. (1) Before determining the sentence, a court shall give the prosecutor and the offender an opportunity to make submissions with respect to any facts relevant to the sentence to be imposed.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Submission of evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The court shall hear any relevant evidence presented by the prosecutor or the offender.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Production of evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) The court may, on its own motion, after hearing argument from the prosecutor and the offender, require the production of evidence that would assist it in determining the appropriate sentence.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Compel appearance'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Where it is necessary in the interests of justice, the court may, after consulting the parties, compel the appearance of any person who is a compellable witness to assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence.
&lt;p&gt;
...&lt;p&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 723; 1995, c. 22, s. 6.
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;
'''Information accepted'''&lt;br&gt;
724. (1) In determining a sentence, a court may accept as proved any information disclosed at the trial or at the sentencing proceedings and any facts agreed on by the prosecutor and the offender.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec723 CCC]
}}

On a guilty plea, a judge may rely on facts that are agreed upon by the parties. The Crown will read the facts alleged as well as submit allegations of prior criminal convictions.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R v Bartlett, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m697 2005 NLCA 75] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt; The Defence must have an opportunity to deny or consent to the allegations.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Cataract (1994), 93 CCC 486 (SaskCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, at a minimum the crown should read-in enough facts to make out the essential elements of the offence. Preferably there should also be all admitted facts going to aggravating and mitigating factors.

Factors to consider whether untried conduct is admissible to establish character includes the following:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Edwards, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fbx6 2001 CanLII 24105] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;
# the nexus between the evidence and the offence for which the offender was convicted—the closer the connection the more likely the evidence will shed light on the circumstances of the charged offence;
# the similarity between the evidence and the offence for which the offender was convicted;
# the difficulty the offender may encounter in properly defending against the allegations in the proposed evidence;
# the danger that the sentence hearing will be unduly prolonged;
# the danger that the focus of the sentence hearing will appear to be diverted from the true purpose of imposing a fit sentence for the charged offence that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender in accordance with s. 718.1;
# whether, as in Lees, the offender has adduced evidence of good character; and
# the cogency of the proposed evidence.

      <comment>/* Joint Recommendations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
A plea bargain is an agreement between the Crown and defence whereby the Defence agrees to plead guilty to particular offences in exchange for a particular proposal on sentence. If the defence accepts the offer on sentence, the agreement is put the judge as a jointly recommended sentence. 

==Joint Recommendations==
A joint recommendation is an agreement on penalty between the Crown and Defence to present a single penalty recommendation that the judge is asked to adopt. 

A joint recommendation does not need to encompass all aspects of the sentence. There can be a joint recommendation on part of a sentence, such as the form of penalty, while still keeping aspects of the penalty in dispute, such as the length of the penalty, conditions associated with the penalty, or ancillary orders.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. R. v. Parsons, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvf3f 2012 CanLII 81320] (NL SCTD) - length of CSO and ancillary orders in dispute alone&lt;/ref&gt;

A joint submission often indicates a lower range of sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Kane [http://canlii.ca/t/fs972 2012 NLCA 53]&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation for an agreement is often due to a weak aspect in the Crown's case or the risk of the judge giving a higher penalty than what would sought by defence without an agreement. 

A joint recommendation may even be accepted where it is more lenient than the lower end of the normal range.&lt;ref&gt;R v Oake [http://canlii.ca/t/28pd1 2010 NLCA 19] at 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentences arising from a joint recommendation &quot;have little or no precedential value.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Johnston, [http://canlii.ca/t/fmqxj 2011 NLCA 56] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Johnson, [http://canlii.ca/t/2ct1p 2010 ABQB 546] &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Benlolo [http://canlii.ca/t/1nj8l 2006 CanLII 19284] (ON CA), (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 440 (C.A.)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deference'''&lt;br&gt;
A joint recommended sentence is a sentence for which the courts do not readily overturn. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. J.W.I.B., [http://canlii.ca/t/58s1 2003 MBCA 92]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Pashe (S.J.) [http://canlii.ca/t/1pfkc 1995 CanLII 6256] (MB C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The court may only do so where the sentence in not within a reasonably appropriate range for the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Smith, [http://canlii.ca/t/1jj1t 2004 BCCA 657] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Gartner, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fptk 2010 BCCA 600] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Wickstrom, [http://canlii.ca/t/flrqw 2011 BCSC 745]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cerasuolo [http://canlii.ca/t/1fbn2 2001 CanLII 24172] (ON CA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. DeSousa, [http://canlii.ca/t/fr17k 2012 ONCA 254]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The judge must give reasons for not adopting a joint recommendation.

A judge should give serious consideration to a joint sentencing proposal.&lt;ref&gt;R v GWC, [http://canlii.ca/t/5rmx 2000 ABCA 333] at para 17&lt;/ref&gt;

There is less weight given to &quot;joint recommendations&quot; that do not involve a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; (i.e. some reduced recommendation on sentence).&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Wolonciej, [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2011/2011mbca91/2011mbca91.html 2011 MBCA 91] at 10&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, where the accused was without counsel less deference is given.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bambrick, [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlca/doc/2011/2011nlca79/2011nlca79.html 2011 NLCA 79] at para. 14&lt;/reF&gt;

'''When Not Followed'''&lt;br&gt;
If a judge has reservations to adopt a joint recommendations it should allow counsel an opportunity to respond.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v GWC, 2000 ABCA 333 (CanLII), 2000 ABCA 333 at 26
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Likewise, where a judge is looking to go beyond the range set by counsel, the judge should equally provide notice to the parties before going above or below the range.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Hood, [http://canlii.ca/t/flqvp 2011 ABCA 169] at 14&lt;Br&gt; 
R v Abel, [http://canlii.ca/t/fm1mv 2011 NWTCA 4] at 23&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Burback, [http://canlii.ca/t/fq14b 2012 ABCA 30]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/reF&gt; 
Similarly, where a judge wishes to impose a condition that was not contemplated by either party nor could it have been easily foreseen, then the judge should also provide notice before doing so.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Beal, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fk7g 2011 ABCA 35]
&lt;/reF&gt;

'''Other Issues'''&lt;br&gt;
Where the accused misapprehended the joint recommendation, it can be grounds for a successful appeal of a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R v Kinney, [http://www.canlii.org/en/sk/skca/doc/2011/2011skca122/2011skca122.html 2011 SKCA 122]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Where an offender is unaware of a significant consequence of a particular sentence agreed upon, such as deportation without appeal, the court may reopen the consideration of sentence.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Jamieson, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpf0n 2011 NSCA 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
It generally preferred that when calculating a global sentence for multiple offences that the sentence be determined before taking into account pre-trial custody. Instead, the ordered sentence should be declared to be reduced for pre-trial custody credit.
&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Schira,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2004/2004abca369/2004abca369.html 2004 ABCA 369]
R. v. Letta,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2004/2004mbca179/2004mbca179.html 2004 MBCA 179]
&lt;/ref&gt;

A failure to take into account remand time is an error of principle.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Aubin [http://canlii.ca/t/2607r#par2 2009 BCCA 418 at 2] &lt;/ref&gt;
The method of taking into account remand time is to first calculate the total sentence and then deduct an amount of credit based on the amount of time served.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Orr [http://canlii.ca/t/1vsdv 2008 BCCA 76] at para. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

On February, 2010, the ''Truth in Sentencing Act'' came into force limiting to circumstances where offenders on remand can get 2 for 1 credit. All offences occurring before that date will still be subject to the old rules of remand credit.

Prior to 2010, courts had discretion to grant 2:1 remand credit for time spent in custody. In practice, this was granted in most cases. The addition of s. 719(3.1) required a credit of 1:1 unless justified and with a maximum of 1:1.5 credit for remand time.

{{Quotation|
s. 719&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Determination of sentence'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence but the court shall limit any credit for that time to a maximum of one day for each day spent in custody.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Exception'''&lt;br&gt;
(3.1) Despite subsection (3), if the circumstances justify it, the maximum is one and one-half days for each day spent in custody unless the reason for detaining the person in custody was stated in the record under subsection 515(9.1) or the person was detained in custody under subsection 524(4) or (8).
&lt;P&gt;
'''Reasons'''&lt;br&gt;
(3.2) The court shall give reasons for any credit granted and shall cause those reasons to be stated in the record.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Record of proceedings'''&lt;br&gt;
(3.3) The court shall cause to be stated in the record and on the warrant of committal the offence, the amount of time spent in custody, the term of imprisonment that would have been imposed before any credit was granted, the amount of time credited, if any, and the sentence imposed.
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 719; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 157; 1995, c. 22, s. 6; 2009, c. 29, s. 3.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec719 CCC]
}}

Where the offence is one with a mandatory minimum, the court may give remand credit that has the effect of reducing the sentence below the mandatory jail sentence.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Wust 2000 18&lt;br&gt; R. v. Arthurs, 2000 SCC 19 at 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstances in which enhanced credit have been given include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Stonefish, 2012 MBCA 116 (CanLII) - summary of circumstances of enhanced credit&lt;/ref&gt;
# Conditions of the remand facilities:
## lack of available programming and counselling&lt;Ref&gt;
e.g., R. v. Haly, 2012 ONSC 2302 (CanLII) -- 1.2:1 time was given&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Mullins (P.E.), 2011 SKQB 478 (CanLII)&lt;Br&gt;
R. c. Auger, 2012 QCCQ 568 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
## frequency of lockdowns during remand&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. Mullins&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Oates, 2012 ONCJ 461 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
c.f. R. v. Sayed, 2012 ONSC 843 (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;
## duration of time in solitary confinement&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., R. v. Seymour, 2011 BCSC 1682 (CanLII) solitary for his own protection&lt;br&gt;
R. c. Guo, 2011 QCCQ 10469 (CanLII)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
## other harsh circumstances in the facility such as double bunking, sleeping on floor, violence, etc.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., R. v. J.B., 2011 BCPC 158 (CanLII) - double-bunking and exposure to violence&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Clayton, 2012 ABQB 333 (CanLII) - overcrowding, slept on the floor&lt;Br&gt;
Auger - no visitors while on remand&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# delay post-trial not attributed to the accused:
## delay due to court scheduling&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., R. v. Dingwell (D.A.), 2012 PESC 13 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. B.R.S., 2011 ONCJ 484 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Sabatine, 2012 ONCJ 310 (CanLII) - judge requested further submissions and time spent drafting reasons&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
## request by Court or Crown for a pre-sentence report or Gladue report&lt;ref&gt;
e.g,. R. v. House (Z.C.) (2012), 319 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 197 (NL Prov. Ct.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Sharkey, 2011 BCSC 1541 (CanLII)&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Mozumdar, 2012 ONCJ 151 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
## multiple court appearances for the purposes of sentencing&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., R. v. Przybyla, 2012 ABPC 183 (CanLII)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# delay due to Crown&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., R. c. Lefrançois, 2012 QCCQ 5655 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Enhanced credit will be ''denied'' in circumstances such as:
# delay caused by the offender, including where the proceedings are drawn out deliberately.&lt;Ref&gt;
See R. v. Leggo (R.) (2012), 317 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 252 (NL Prov. Ct.)&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Morris, 2011 ONSC 5206 (CanLII)

Under [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec722 s. 722(2)], the Court must consider victim impact statements that are submitted to the court. After a finding of guilt, the court is required under [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec722.2 s. 722.2(1)], to inquire whether the victim has been advised of the opportunity to prepare a victim impact statement.

{{reflist|2}}

==Persons Who can File a VIS==
Only a victim may file a VIS. Section 722(4) defines a victim as:
{{quotation|
'''Definition of “victim”'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) For the purposes of this section and section 722.2, “victim”, in relation to an offence,
:(a) means a person to whom harm was done or who suffered physical or emotional loss as a result of the commission of the offence; and
:(b) where the person described in paragraph (a) is dead, ill or otherwise incapable of making a statement referred to in subsection (1), includes the spouse or common-law partner or any relative of that person, anyone who has in law or fact the custody of that person or is responsible for the care or support of that person or any dependant of that person.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 722; 1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1999, c. 25, s. 17(Preamble); 2000, c. 12, s. 95.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec722 CCC]
}}

The victim must also be capable of &quot;describing the harm done to, or loss suffered by, the victim arising from the commission of the offence.&quot;(s. 722(1))

It has been recommended that VIS not be permitted in by persons who are &quot;unidentified in their connection to the [victim] or too remote in connection&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel at para.48&lt;/ref&gt;


==Form of Statement==
It has been suggested that in order for a VIS to be admissible it should contain the following:
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gabriel (1999), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. Sup. Ct.) at para. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
*the statement is to be prepared in writing,
*the statement is to be in the form and in accordance with procedures established by a program designated for that purpose by the province,
*the statement is to be authored by a person meeting the definition of &quot;victim&quot; (s. 722(4) of the Code),
*the statement is to describe the harm done to, or loss suffered by, the victim arising from the commission of the offence,
*the statement is to be filed with the Court,
*the clerk of the Court is to provide a copy of the statement to the prosecution and the defence (s. 722.1 of the Code)

It is important that when considering the VIS that the court maintain its “independent neutrality&quot; by not &quot;react[ing] to public opinion as to the severity of sentences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Gabriel at para. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Admissible Content==

Impact statements should describe &quot;the harm done to, or loss suffered by, the victim arising from the commission of the offence&quot;. (s. 722(1))


==Inappropriate Content for a VIS==
The Statement should describe the harm arising out of the offence. It is not an opportunity for the victim to criticize the offender, including his character, assert facts or recommend sentence. Such comments are inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gabriel, 1999 CanLII 15050 (ON S.C.) 137 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at para. 16&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Bremner, 2000 BCCA 345 at 27&lt;/ref&gt; Nor should there be reference to offences not charged.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Noor, 2011 BCSC 1629 at 21&lt;/ref&gt;

There is limited cases where sentence recommendation may be admissible, such as during a sentencing circle.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel at para. 29 to 33&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested the follow sort of statements not be permitted:&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel at para. 48 to 53&lt;/ref&gt;
# statements by persons with unidentified connections to the victim or to remote a connection
# references to facts that are not accurate
# statements speaking of the offender including character&lt;ref&gt;e.g.R. v. Walchuk, [2001] S.J. No. 148 (Sask.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
# suggesting penalties 
# seeks personal revenge &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bremner [2000] B.C.J. No. 1096 (B.C.C.A), R. v. Sangha, [2001] A.J. No. 545 (Alta. Q.B.), R. v. D.M.L.G. [2001], S.J. No. 581 (Sask. Prov. Ct.), R. v. Hawley [1999] O.J. No. 5393  &lt;/ref&gt;
# promoting an &quot;eye for an eye&quot;
# statements that are inflammatory and jeopardize the desired restraint in sentencing&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bremner [2000] B.C.J. No. 1096 (B.C.C.A) calls offender a pedophile&lt;/ref&gt;
# makes diagnoses of the offender&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Bremner [2000] B.C.J. No. 1096 (B.C.C.A) calls him a pedophile&lt;/ref&gt;
# mischaracterizations of the offence or the law

==Offence Specific Impact Statement==
{{quotation|
'''Community impact statement'''&lt;br&gt;
380.4 (1) For greater certainty, for the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed on an offender, or whether the offender should be discharged under section 730, in respect of an offence referred to in subsection 380(1), the court may consider a statement made by a person on a community’s behalf describing the harm done to, or losses suffered by, the community arising from the commission of the offence.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Procedure'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The statement must
:(a) be prepared in writing and filed with the court;
:(b) identify the community on whose behalf the statement is made; and
:(c) explain how the statement reflects the community’s views.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Copy of statement'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) The clerk of the court shall provide a copy of the statement, as soon as practicable after a finding of guilt, to the offender or counsel for the offender, and to the prosecutor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Guilty plea or Conviction==

A sentencing hearing is to be commenced &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; after the point where a conviction has been entered.&lt;ref&gt;Section 720(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Submissions of counsel==
Both the Crown and Defence are permitted to make submissions to facts for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;s. 723(1); R. v. Digiacomo, 2002 BCCA 444&lt;/ref&gt; However, submissions themselves do not constitute evidence.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Jackman, [1996] N.J. No. 107 (NLCA) “cannot be over-emphasized that, in making submissions to Court, counsel are not giving evidence but rather making argument in support of their respective submissions.”&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Accused addressing the Court==
At the end of the submissions by counsel, the accused is entitled to make comments to the court.&lt;ref&gt;s. 726&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to allow the accused to speak will not invalidate the sentence if it is an inadvertent slip or error.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Senek (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 473 (Man. C.A.)[http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/1998/1998canlii17680/1998canlii17680.html] &lt;br&gt;

R. v. Haug 2002 SKCA 49 
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Judgement on Sentence==
A judge, in deciding on a sentence, after hearing the recommendations from both Crown and Defence, may go above the range recommended by Crown counsel, but must do so after giving reasons for the sentence given.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jones, [http://canlii.ca/t/fsqtm 2012 ONCA 609] (CanLII) at para. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also recommended that the judge give counsel an opportunity to make further submissions.&lt;ref&gt;
see R v Hood, 2011 ABCA 169 (CanLII) at para 15&lt;br&gt;
R v Keough, 2012 ABCA 14 (CanLII) at paras 19 to 20 and 51 to 57&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon deciding on a particular sentence the judge shall comply with s.570 and 806 requiring him to make a minute or memorandum of conviction and upon request, make a conviction order under Form 35 or 36. Further a warrant of committal, if applicable, will be made under Form 21 or 22.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Statutory Minimum==
It has been agreed upon by several courts that mandatory minimums act as an &quot;inflationary floor&quot; and sets a new minimum punishment for the best offender.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Morrisey, 2000 SCC 39 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc39/2000scc39.html], discussed in minority decision&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Colville, 2005 ABCA 319 at paras. 21-26 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2005/2005abca319/2005abca319.html] &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Ferguson, 2006 ABCA 261 at para. 85&lt;br&gt;
R. v. B.C.M., 2008 BCCA 365 [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2008/2008bcca365/2008bcca365.html] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Newman, 2009 NLCA 32
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory Maximums==
The maximum available sentence for a given offence will be provided within the provisions defining the offence.

Given the distinction between summary offences and indictable offences, the maximum penalties for summary offences will always be less than indictable. 

Where an offence is punishable by &quot;summary conviction&quot;, [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec787 section 787(1)] states the punishment will be a fine of no more than $5,000 and/or 6 months jail unless the offence specifies otherwise. Other available summary offence maximums include 18 months jail.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. s. 253, 264.1&lt;/ref&gt;

However, under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec735 s. 735] where the accused is an organization, the summary conviction fine amount increases to $100,000.

The maximum for indictable offences will always be specified in the provisions. The code will specify a maximum of 2, 5, 10, 14 years jail or life.

It is generally stated that the maximum penalty is not simply reserved for the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; offenders.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Solowan, 2008 SCC 62, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 309 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc62/2008scc62.html]; R. v. L.M., 2008 SCC 31, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc31/2008scc31.html]&lt;/ref&gt; All relevant factors must be considered and should only be consdered appropriate where the &quot;offence is of sufficient gravity and the offender displays sufficient blameworthiness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cheddesingh,2004 SCC 16, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 433 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2004/2004scc16/2004scc16.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

On summary elections for hybrid offences, the court is bound by the maximum range set by parliament. However, the courts should not &quot;scale up&quot; or &quot;scale down&quot; the sentences due to the election.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Solowan, ''supra''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Cumulative punishments are known as consecutive sentences. This only applies to jail sentences, all other sentences run concurrently.

All sentences are presumed to be served concurrently. The Code provides for cumulative punishments at section 718.3:
{{quotation|
718.3
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;
'''Cumulative punishments'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The court or youth justice court that sentences an accused may direct that the terms of imprisonment that are imposed by the court or the youth justice court or that result from the operation of subsection 734(4) or 743.5(1) or (2) shall be served consecutively, when
:(a) the accused is sentenced while under sentence for an offence, and a term of imprisonment, whether in default of payment of a fine or otherwise, is imposed;
:(b) the accused is found guilty or convicted of an offence punishable with both a fine and imprisonment and both are imposed;
:(c) the accused is found guilty or convicted of more than one offence, and
::(i) more than one fine is imposed,
::(ii) terms of imprisonment for the respective offences are imposed, or
::(iii) a term of imprisonment is imposed in respect of one offence and a fine is imposed in respect of another offence; or
:(d) subsection 743.5(1) or (2) applies.&lt;P&gt; 
1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1997, c. 18, s. 141; 2002, c. 1, s. 182.
|[http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec718.3 CCC]
}}

Generally, sentences for offences that occur at separate occasions will be served consecutively.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Dube 2006 QCCA 699 [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qcca/doc/2006/2006qcca699/2006qcca699.html]; R. v. Howett (1982) BCCA&lt;/ref&gt; While where the offences arise out of the same transaction, the sentences will be typically concurrent.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Mascarenhas, 2002 CanLII 41625 (ON CA) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2002/2002canlii41625/2002canlii41625.html]; &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Veysey, 2006 NBCA 55 [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbca/doc/2006/2006nbca55/2006nbca55.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Desmarest (1986), 2 Q.A.C. 151 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Charchuk (1973), 6 N.S.R. (2d) 519
 &lt;/ref&gt;
If the court does not indicate whether sentences are concurrent or consecutive it is presumed concurrent.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McCarthy 2005 NLCA __&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, the decision of consecutive sentences is one entitled to deference.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. M.(T.E.), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at para. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentences may be imposed consecutively in relation to a single transaction where the punishments protect &quot;different societal interests&quot; or &quot;different legal interests&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gillis, 2009 ONCA 312 [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2009/2009onca312/2009onca312.html]; R. v. Clarke (1994), 94 CCC 249(NSCA)&lt;/ref&gt; A judge should consider the time frame within which the offences occurred, the similarity of the offences, whether a new intent or impulse initiated each of the offences and whether the total sentence is fit and proper under the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. G.A.W., (1993), 125 N.S.R. (2d) 312 (NSCA)&lt;br&gt; R. v. Naugle, 2011 NSCA 33&lt;/ref&gt;

When deciding whether a sentence should be consecutive or concurrent, the court should consider 1) the time frame of the offences, 2) the similarity of the offences, 3) whether a new intent broached each offence, and 4) whether the total sentence is fit and proper.&lt;ref&gt;  R. v. G.A.W., (1993), 125 N.S.R. (2d) 312 (NSCA);&lt;br&gt; R. v. Naugle, 2011 NSCA 33 (CanLII), 2011 NSCA 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain sentences must be ordered to be served consecutively:
#Commission of indictable offence to advantage a terrorist group (s. 83.2 and s. 83.26)
#Instructing activity for terrorist group (s. 83.21(1) and s. 83.26)
#Instructing terrorist activity (s. 83.22(1) and s. 83.26)
#Instructing commission of offence for criminal organization (s. 467.13(1) and s. 467.14)

The decision on whether a sentence should be concurrent or consecutive &quot;should be treated with the same deference owed by appellate courts to sentencing judges concerning the length of sentences ordered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948 at para. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Retrospective punishments ==
Section 11(i) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom states:

{{quotation|11. Any person charged with an offence has the right ...
:(i)	if found guilty of the offence and if the punishment for the offence has been varied between the time of commission and the time of sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser punishment.}}

''Ex post facto'' treatment of the offender is not viewed as punishment under s. 11(i). That includes deportation following conviction&lt;Ref&gt;see Re Gittens and the Queen [1983] 1 FC 152, 68 CCC 2d 438 (FCTD); Hurd v. Canada (MEI) [1989] 2 FC 594 (FCA);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and license suspension under provincial law which is considered a &quot;civil disability&quot;&lt;ref&gt;see Johnston v. Superintendent of Motor Vehicles [1987] BCJ No44 (BCSC)&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== SOIRA Orders===
SOIRA legislation is not considered a &quot;punishment&quot; within the meaning of s. 11(i) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms except where the impact of the order amounts to &quot;harsh treatment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cross 2006 NSCA 30 [http://canlii.ca/en/ns/nsca/doc/2006/2006nsca30/2006nsca30.html] at 85&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the dominant line of cases suggests that the provisions of SOIRA are retrospective.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Cross, supra&lt;Br&gt; 
R .v. Aberdeen, [2005] AJ No. 1062 [http://canlii.org/en/ab/abpc/doc/2005/2005abpc203/2005abpc203.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Rouschop&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cruel and Unusual Punishment ==
Section 12 of the Charter states: &quot;Everyone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Symmetric groups ==

'''Theorem 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be any set. Then, the set &lt;math&gt;S_A&lt;/math&gt; of bijections from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to itself, &lt;math&gt;f\,:,A\rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;, form a group under composition of functions.

''Proof'': We have to verify the group axioms. Associativity is fulfilled since composition of functions is always associative: &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h(x) = f\circ g(h(x))=f(g(h(x)))=f(g\circ h(x))=f\circ(g\circ h)(x)&lt;/math&gt; where the composition is defined. The identity element is the identity function given by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{id}_A(a)=a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the inverse of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the function &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; taking &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;. This function exists and is unique since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection. Thus &lt;math&gt;S_A&lt;/math&gt; is a group, as stated. {{Unicode|∎}}


&lt;math&gt;S_A&lt;/math&gt; is called ''the symmetric group on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;''. When &lt;math&gt;A=\{1,2,...,n\}\,,\, n\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, we write its symmetric group as &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;, and we call this group the ''symmetric group on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; letters''. It is also called the group of ''permutations'' on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; letters. As we will see shortly, this is an appropriate name.

Instead of &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, we will use a different symbol, namely &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt;, for the identity function in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;, we can specify &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; by specifying where it sends each element. There are many ways to encode this information mathematically. One obvious way is to indentify &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as the unique &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix with value &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in the entries &lt;math&gt;(i,\sigma(i))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; elsewhere. Composition of functions then corresponds to multiplication of matrices. Indeed, the matrix corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; has value &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in the entries &lt;math&gt;(i,\rho(i))&lt;/math&gt;, which is the same as &lt;math&gt;(\sigma(j),\rho(\sigma(j)))&lt;/math&gt;, so the product has value &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in the entries &lt;math&gt;(j,\rho(\sigma(j)))&lt;/math&gt;. This notation may seem cumbersome. Luckily, there exists a more convenient notation, which we will make use of.

We can represent any &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt; by a &lt;math&gt;2\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;\left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \dots &amp; n \\ \sigma(1) &amp; \sigma(2) &amp; \dots &amp; \sigma(n)\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. We obviously lose the correspondence between function composition and matrix multiplication, but we gain a more readable notation. For the time being, we will use this.


'''Remark 2:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\rho\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then the product &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho \equiv \sigma \circ \rho&lt;/math&gt; is the function obtained by ''first'' acting with &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, and ''then'' by &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho(x)=\sigma (\rho (x))&lt;/math&gt;. This point is important to keep in mind when computing products in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Some textbooks try to remedy the frequent confusion by writing functions like &lt;math&gt;(x)\rho\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, that is, writing arguments on the ''left'' of functions. We will ''not'' do this, as it is not standard. The reader should use the next example and theorem to get a feeling for products in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example 3:''' We will show the multiplication table for &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;. We introduce the special notation for &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\iota=\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rho_1=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho_2=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_1 = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_2= \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_3=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;. The multiplication table for &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt; is then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|cccccc} \circ &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \mu_3 \\ \hline \rho_0 &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \mu_3 \\ \rho_1 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \mu_3 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 \\ \rho_2 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \mu_3 &amp; \mu_1 \\ \mu_1 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \mu_3 &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \rho_1 \\ \mu_2 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \mu_3 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \rho_2 \\ \mu_3 &amp; \mu_3 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \rho_0 \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;


'''Theorem 4:''' &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; has order &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': This follows from a counting argument. We can specify a unique element in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; by specifying where each &lt;math&gt;i\in\{1,2,...,n\}&lt;/math&gt; is sent. Also, any permutation can be specified this way. Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;. In choosing &lt;math&gt;\sigma(1)&lt;/math&gt; we are completely free and have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; choices. Then, when choosing &lt;math&gt;\sigma(2)&lt;/math&gt; we must choose from &lt;math&gt;\{1,...,n\}-\{\sigma(1)\}&lt;/math&gt;, giving a total of &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; choices. Continuing in this fashion, we see that for &lt;math&gt;\sigma(i)&lt;/math&gt; we must choose from &lt;math&gt;\{1,...,n\}-\{\sigma(1),...,\sigma(i-1)\}&lt;/math&gt;, giving a total of &lt;math&gt;n+1-i&lt;/math&gt; choices. The total number of ways in which we can specify an element, and thus the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is then &lt;math&gt;|S_n|=\prod_{i=1}^n (n+1-i)=n(n-1)...\cdot 2 \cdot 1 = n!&lt;/math&gt;, as was to be shown. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 5:''' &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is non-abelian for all &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \dots &amp; n \\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; \dots &amp; n\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt; be the function only interchanging 1 and 2, and &lt;math&gt;\rho=\left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \dots &amp; n \\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; \dots &amp; n\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt; be the function only interchanging 2 and 3. Then &lt;math&gt;\sigma \rho = \left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \dots &amp; n \\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; \dots &amp; n\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho\sigma = \left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \dots &amp; n \\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \dots &amp; n\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho \neq \rho \sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is not abelian. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma^n=\iota&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is called an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;''-cycle'', where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest positive such integer. Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; be the set of integers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma(a)\neq a&lt;/math&gt;. Two cycles &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\rho&lt;/math&gt; are called ''disjoint'' if &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*\cap \rho^* = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. Also, a 2-cycle is called a ''transposition''.


'''Theorem 7:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\rho\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*\cap \rho^*=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho=\rho\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': For any integer &lt;math&gt;1\leq a\leq n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a\in \sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;a\not\in\rho^*&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho(a)=\sigma(\iota(a))=\sigma(a)=\iota(\sigma(a))=\rho(\sigma(a))=\rho\sigma(a)&lt;/math&gt;. A similar argument holds for &lt;math&gt;a\in \rho^*&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;a\not\in\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;a\not\in\sigma^*\cup\rho^*&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho(a)=\sigma(a)=a=\rho(a)=\rho\sigma(a)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*\cap\rho^*=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, we have now exhausted every &lt;math&gt;a\in \{1,...,n\}&lt;/math&gt;, and we are done. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 8:''' Any permutation can be represented as a composition of disjoint cycles.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Choose an element &lt;math&gt;a\in \sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; and compute &lt;math&gt;\sigma(a),\sigma^2(a),...,\sigma^k(a)=a&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is finite of order &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt;, we know that &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; exists and &lt;math&gt;k \leq n!&lt;/math&gt;. We have now found a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-cycle &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; including &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1^* = \{a,\sigma(a),...,\sigma^{k-1}(a)\}&lt;/math&gt;, this cycle may be factored out &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, obtaining &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\sigma_1\sigma^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Repeat this process, which terminates since &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; is finite, and we have contructed a composition of disjoint cycles which equal &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


Now that we have shown that all permuations are just compositions of disjoint cycles, we can introduce the ultimate shorthand notation for permutations. For an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-cycle &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, we can show its action by choosing any element &lt;math&gt;a\in\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; and writing &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\left(a\ \sigma(a)\ \sigma^{2}(a)\ ...\ \sigma^{n-1}(a)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 9:''' Any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-cycle can be represented as a composition of transpositions.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\left(a\ \sigma(a)\ \sigma^{2}(a)\ ...\ \sigma^{n-1}(a)\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \left( a\ \sigma^2(a)\ ...\ \sigma^{n-1}(a)\right)\left(a\ \sigma(a)\right)&lt;/math&gt; (check this!), omitting the composition sign &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;. Interate this process to obtain &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\left(a\ \sigma^{n-1}(a)\right)...\left(a\ \sigma^{2}(a)\right)\left(a\ \sigma(a)\right)&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Note 10:''' This way of representing &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as a product of transpositions is ''not'' unique. However, as we will see now, the &quot;parity&quot; of such a representation is well defined.


'''Definition 11:''' The ''parity'' of a permutation is ''even'' if it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions. Otherwise, it is ''odd''. We define the function &lt;math&gt;\sgn(\sigma)=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is even and &lt;math&gt;\sgn(\sigma)=-1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is odd.


'''Lemma 12:''' The indentity &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; has even parity.

''Proof'': Observe first that &lt;math&gt;\iota \neq (a\ b)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a\neq b&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the minimum number of transpositions neccesary to represent &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; is 2: &lt;math&gt;\iota=(a\ b)(a\ b)&lt;/math&gt;. Now, assume that for any representation using less than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; transpositions must be even. Thus, let &lt;math&gt;\iota=(a_1\ b_1)...(a_k\ b_k)&lt;/math&gt;. Now, since in paticular &lt;math&gt;\iota(a_1)=a_1&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;a_1\in (a_i\ b_i)^*&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;1&lt;i\leq k&lt;/math&gt;. Since disjoint transpositions commute, and &lt;math&gt;(a_r\ a_s)(a_i\ a_r)=(a_i\ a_s)(a_r\ a_s)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a_i\neq a_r\neq a_s&lt;/math&gt;, it is always possible to configure the transpositions such that the first two transpositions are either &lt;math&gt;(a_1\ b_1)(a_1\ b_1)=\iota&lt;/math&gt;, reducing the number of transposition by two, or &lt;math&gt;(a_1\ b_1)(a_1\ b_2)=(a_1\ b_2)(b_1\ b_2)&lt;/math&gt;. In this case we have reduced the number of transpositions involving &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; by 1. We restart the same process as above. with the new representation. Since only a finite number of transpositions move &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, we will eventually be able to cancel two permutations and be left with &lt;math&gt;k-2&lt;/math&gt; transpositions in the product. Then, by the induction hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;k-2&lt;/math&gt; must be even and so &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is even as well, proving the lemma. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 13:''' The parity of a permutation, and thus the &lt;math&gt;\sgn&lt;/math&gt; function, is well-defined.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt; and write &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as a product of transposition in two different ways: &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\tau_1...\tau_k=\tau_1^\prime...\tau_{k^\prime}^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Then, since &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; has even parity by Lemma 11 and &lt;math&gt;\iota = \sigma\sigma^{-1} = \tau_1...\tau_k\tau_{k^\prime}^\prime ... \tau_1^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;k+k^\prime \equiv 0 \ \mathrm{mod}\ 2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k\equiv k^\prime\ \mathrm{mod}\ 2&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; has a uniquely defined parity, and consequentially &lt;math&gt;\sgn&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 14:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\rho\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\sgn(\sigma\rho)=\sgn(\sigma)\sgn(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Decompose &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; into transpositions: &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\mu_1...\mu_k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho=\nu_1...\nu_l&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho=\mu_1...\mu_k\nu_1...\nu_l&lt;/math&gt; has parity given by &lt;math&gt;k+l&lt;/math&gt;. If both are even or odd, &lt;math&gt;k+l&lt;/math&gt; is even and indeed &lt;math&gt;\sgn(\sigma)\sgn(\rho)=1\cdot 1=1=\sgn(\sigma\rho)&lt;/math&gt;. If one is odd and one is even, &lt;math&gt;k+l&lt;/math&gt; is odd and again &lt;math&gt;\sgn(\sigma)\sgn(\rho)=(-1)\cdot 1=-1=\sgn(\sigma\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Lemma 15:''' The number of even permutations in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; equals the number of odd permutations.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; be any even permutation and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; a transposition. Then &lt;math&gt;\tau\sigma&lt;/math&gt; has odd parity by Theorem 14. Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be the set of even permutations and &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; the set of odd permutations. Then the function &lt;math&gt;f:E\rightarrow O&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;f(\sigma)=\tau\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in E&lt;/math&gt; and a fixed transposition &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, is a bijection. (Indeed, it is a transposition in &lt;math&gt;S_{S_n}&lt;/math&gt;!) Thus &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; have the same number of elements, as stated. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 16:''' Let the set of all even permutations in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; be denoted by &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''alternating group'' on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; letters.


'''Theorem 17:''' &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; ''is'' a group, and is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We first show that &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is a group under composition. Then it is automatically a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. That &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is closed under composition follows from Theorem 14 and associativity is inherited from &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Also, the identity permutation is even, so &lt;math&gt;\iota\in A_n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is a group and a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since the number of even and odd permutations are equal by Lemma 14, we then have that &lt;math&gt;|A_n|=\frac{|S_n|}{2}=\frac{n!}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 18:''' Let &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is generated by the 3-cycles in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We must show that any even permutation can be decomposed into 3-cycles. It is sufficient to show that this is the case for pairs of transpositions. Let &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d\in S_n&lt;/math&gt; be distinct. Then, by some casework,

:i) &lt;math&gt;(a\ b)(a\ b)=(a\ b\ c)^3&lt;/math&gt;,

:ii) &lt;math&gt;(a\ b)(b\ c)=(c\ a\ b)&lt;/math&gt;, and

:iii) &lt;math&gt;(a\ b)(c\ d)=(a\ d\ c)(a\ b\ c)&lt;/math&gt;,

proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


In a previous section we proved Lagrange's Theorem: The order of any subgroup divides the order of the parent group. However, the converse statement, that a group has a subgroup for every divisor of its order, is false! The smallest group providing a counterexample is the alternating group &lt;math&gt;A_4&lt;/math&gt;, which has order 12 but no subgroup of order 6. It has subgroups of orders 3 and 4, corresponding respectively to the cyclic group of order 3 and the Klein 4-group. However, if we add any other element to the subgroup corresponding to &lt;math&gt;C_3&lt;/math&gt;, it generates the whole group &lt;math&gt;A_4&lt;/math&gt;. We leave it to the reader to show this.

== Dihedral Groups ==

[[File:Hexagon Reflections.png|thumb|The lines represent the reflection symmetries of a regular hexagon]]
[[File:Dihedral8.png|thumb|Illustration of the elements of the dihedral group &lt;math&gt;D_{16}&lt;/math&gt; as rotations and reflections of a stop sign.]]
The dihedral groups are the symmetry groups of regular polygons. As such, they are subgroups of the symmetric groups. In general, a regular &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-gon has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rotational symmetries and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; reflection symmetries. The dihedral groups capture these by consisting of the associated rotations and reflections.


'''Definition 19:''' The ''dihedral group of order ''&lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;D_{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, is the group of rotations and reflections of a regular &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-gon.


'''Theorem 20:''' The order of &lt;math&gt;D_{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is precisely &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; be a rotation that generates a subgroup of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;D_{2n}&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously, &lt;math&gt;\langle\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; then captures all the pure rotations of a regular &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-gon. Now let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be any rotation in  The rest of the elements can then be found by composing each element in &lt;math&gt;\langle\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. We get a list of elements &lt;math&gt;D_{2n}=\{ \iota,\rho,...,\rho^{n-1},\mu,\mu\rho,...,\mu\rho^{n-1}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the order of &lt;math&gt;D_{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;, justifying its notation and proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Remark 21:''' From this proof we can also see that &lt;math&gt;\{\rho,\mu\}&lt;/math&gt; is a generating set for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and all elements can be obtained by writing arbitrary products of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and simplifying the expression according to the rules &lt;math&gt;\rho^n=\iota&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu^2=\iota&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho\mu=\mu\rho^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, as can be seen from the figure, a rotation composed with a reflection is new reflection.

&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

[[File:CPT-Structured_Chart_Example.svg|thumb|center|350px|Structure charts can map the structure and data flow of complicated tasks]]
A Structure Chart in software engineering is a chart which shows the breakdown of a system to its lowest manageable parts. They are used in structured programming to arrange program modules into a tree. Each module is represented by a box, which contains the module's name. The tree structure visualizes the relationships between modules, showing data transfer between modules using arrows.  Structured Charts are an example of a '''top-down''' design where a problem (the program) is broken into its components.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Symbol !! Name !! Meaning
|-
| 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;  style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|-
| Module&lt;br/&gt;Name
|}
 || Process || Each Box represents a programming module, this might be something that calculates the average of some figures, or prints out some pay slips
|-
| [[File:CPT-Structured Chart Data Couple.svg]] || Data Couple || Data being passed from module to module that needs to be processed.
|-
| [[File:CPT-Structured Chart Flag.svg]] || Flag || [Extension - you don't need to know this for the exam] Check data sent to process to stop or start processes.  For example when the End of a File that is being read is reached, or a flag to say whether data sent was in the correct format
|}

Let's take a look at a simple example of how this might be executed when representing the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
dim num1 as integer
dim num2 as integer

sub calculateAverage()
  dim avg as integer
  inputNums()
  avg = average(num1, num2)
  outputAvg(avg)
end sub

function average(a,b)
  return (a + b) / 2
end function

sub inputNums()
  num1 = console.readline()
  num2 = console.readline()
end sub

sub outputAvg(x)
  console.writeline(&quot;average = &quot; &amp; x)
end sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

[[File:CPT-Structured Chart Average.svg|thumb|400px|center|A structure chart for the above code]]
{{CPTExercise|title=Exercise: Structure Charts}}
{{CPTQuestionTab}}
Create structure charts for the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
sub main()
  dim num1 as integer
  dim num2 as integer
  dim avg as integer
  sayHello()
  num1 = 34
  num2 = 89
  avg = average(num1, num2)
end sub

function average(a,b)
  return (a + b) / 2
end function

sub sayHello()
  console.writeline(&quot;hello&quot;)
end sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

{{Robox/Close}}

====Selection====
[[File:CPT-Structured Chart Selection.svg|thumb|center|200px|Structure Chart representation of the selection code]]
A selection in a Structure Chart is determined by the diamond symbol.  This means a condition will be checked and depending on the result, different modules will be executed.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
sub main()
  dim num1 as integer
  num1 = console.readline()
  if num1 = 7 then
     luckyNumber()
  else
     otherNumber()
  endif
end sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Iteration====
[[File:CPT-Structured Chart Loop.svg|thumb|center|85px|Structure Chart of the code to the left]]
Using the semi circular arrow we can represent iteration in Structure Charts.  The arrow encompasses a link to a module, implying that module is executed multiple times.  Let's take a look at a coded example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
sub main()
  dim num1 as integer
  num1 = console.readline()
  while num1 &gt; 0 do
     num1 = countdown(num1)
  end while
end sub

sub countdown(a)
  return a - 1
end sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

{{CPTExercise|title=Exercise: Structure Charts, Iteration and Selection}}
{{CPTQuestionTab}}
Create structure charts for the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
sub howManyThrees()
  dim num1, count, total as integer
  num1 = startMsg()
  count = 0
  total = 0
  while num1 &gt; 0 do
     checkNumber(count, total, num1)
     num1 = num1 - 1
  end while
  endMsg(count)
end sub

sub checkNumber(byRef c, byRef t, byVal n)
  If n MOD 3 = 0 Then
     c = divBy3(c)
  Else
     t = add(n, t)
  EndIf
end sub

function divBy3(x)
  return x + 1
end function

function add(n, t)
  return n + t
end function

function startMsg()
  console.writeline(&quot;program started, enter your number&quot;)
  return console.readline()
end function

sub endMsg(n)
  console.writeline(&quot;number of threes : &quot; &amp; n)
end sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

[[File:Utrecht huisvuil.jpg|left|thumb|proper wasteland]]
Protecting the privacy of personal information is very important for both individuals and businesses. Information that individuals and businesses can include tax returns, and passwords for personal websites or social websites, sometimes can include, personal videos pictures, or even music.One key way of doing this is protecting the information located on paper documents and hardware (such as backup media, used CDs, obsolete computers, and mobile phones) that you will be disposing. Papers, CDs, DVDs, and other media containing sensitive data should be shredded. Hard drives should be wiped with special disk-wiping or disk-erasing software before being sold or recycled. Data that has been erased or reformatted can still be recovered so it is best to properly wipe the drive. Physically destroying all of these hardwares is also good so there is no way of getting the important data back and data destruction services are available. Many companies and business do that so no thief or rival can get a hold of their data.  Although you can wipe of your hard drive, sometimes be recovered, but many find difficult to do so. By breaking your hard drive, disks, or CD's with a hammer, it is a safer way to do so. Some companies even melt their information and throw it in a fire.  A movie i have recently watched &quot;Argo&quot;, showed of a U.S base, destroying their files a perfect example of properly disposing their data, informations and hard drives with fire, so the country they were in would not get a hold of their data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Paleoecology uses fossils and sub fossils to recreate the ecosystems and environments in the past. It involves the study of prehistoric fossils of organisms and remains that have been fossilized. The goal is to be able to recreate the fossils paleoenvironments, life cycle, living interactions, and the death and burial of the fossil. It is then that scientists will be able to see the ecosystems of prehistoric organisms and their environs.

==Application==


===General Principles for Offences against Children===
Offences of violence against children by their parents requires a strong response due to their inability to defend themselves and the fiduciary duty towards them.&lt;REf&gt;
R v Laberge [http://canlii.ca/t/2dc8j 1995 ABCA 196] at para 28
&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important factors to consider is the child's exposure to harm and the forseeability of the harm.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Nickel, [http://canlii.ca/t/frgmj 2012 ABCA 158] at 34, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Factors===

Factors include:&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Nickel, [http://canlii.ca/t/frgmj 2012 ABCA 158] at 36&lt;/ref&gt;
# use of weapon or confinement (Nickel)
# use of potentially harmful substances such as drugs or alcohol (Nickel)
# involvement of third parties (Nickel)
# multiplicity of victims or offences over time (Nickel)


{{reflist|2}}

===Range===
The range for a first time offender where the offence concerns the neglect of the elderly will often be between 4 and 8 months.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Peterson, 2005 CanLII 37972 (ON CA) at 59&lt;br&gt;

:(d) the fact that a spouse or common-law partner or child is receiving or has received necessaries of life from another person who is not under a legal duty to provide them is not a defence.&lt;br&gt;

|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec215 CCC]
}}

==Proof of the Offence==
In addition to the essential elements of time, location, identity, the Crown should also prove the follow:
# the accused was subject to a duty under s.215(1) to provide necessities of life, by being either:
## as a parent, foster, parent guardian or head of family to a child under the age of 16
## a spouse or common law partner
## a person in charge to someone who is unable to provide themselves with necessities of life and unable to withdraw from the charge, due to detention, age, illness, mental disorder, or other causes
# either
## the person to whom the duty is owed is &quot;in destitute or necessitous circumstance&quot; due to a breach of the duties or
## the accused caused or likely to have caused the person to whom the duty is owed endangerment of life or health endangered permanently;
# there is no lawful excuse for doing so

==Interpretation==
The purpose of s. 215 is to establish a uniform minimum level of care to be provided to certain designated persons, a societal standard rather than a personal standard.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Naglik, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs0h 1993 CanLII 64] (SCC), [1993] 3 SCR 122&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Necessaries of life&quot; are necessaries that &quot;tend to preserve life and not necessaries in their ordinary legal sense&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Brooks (1902), 5 C. C. C. 372 (BCCA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to seek medical attention can be a failure to provide.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. R. P., [2004] O. J. No. 5109 at para. 29
&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider whether the there is a duty, includes the severity of the injury and the knowledge that it occurred.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Alexander, 2011 ONSC 980 cited in R. v. Turley [2012] B. C. J. No. 540, at para. 146&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the duty is found, the crown must prove:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Turley [2012] B. C. J. No. 540&lt;/ref&gt;
# the accused acts or omissions which led to the failure to provide necessaries of life were a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in similar circumstances, and
# it was objectively foreseeable that the failure to provide necessaries would lead to a risk of danger to the life or permanent endangerment to the health of the person to whom the duty is owed.

&quot;Endangers&quot; refers to exposing someone to danger, harm or risk but does not connote actual injury or damage.&lt;ref&gt; 
also see R. v. Letourneau [2007] O. J. No. 96 at paras 94 and 95&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
A Pre-sentence Report is a report that is generated by a probation officer on order of the court after interviewing the accused and collateral sources that is for the benefit of the judge in determining sentence.

The enabling provision that allows the ordering of a report is section 721, which states:

{{quotation|
'''Report by probation officer'''&lt;br&gt;
721. (1) Subject to regulations made under subsection (2), where an accused, other than an organization, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence, a probation officer shall, if required to do so by a court, prepare and file with the court a report in writing relating to the accused for the purpose of assisting the court in imposing a sentence or in determining whether the accused should be discharged under section 730.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Provincial regulations'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The lieutenant governor in council of a province may make regulations respecting the types of offences for which a court may require a report, and respecting the content and form of the report.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Content of report'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Unless otherwise specified by the court, the report must, wherever possible, contain information on the following matters:
:(a) the offender’s age, maturity, character, behaviour, attitude and willingness to make amends;
:(b) subject to subsection 119(2) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, the history of previous dispositions under the Young Offenders Act, chapter Y-1 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, the history of previous sentences under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, and of previous findings of guilt under this Act and any other Act of Parliament;
:(c) the history of any alternative measures used to deal with the offender, and the offender’s response to those measures; and
:(d) any matter required, by any regulation made under subsection (2), to be included in the report.&lt;br&gt;
'''Idem'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The report must also contain information on any other matter required by the court, after hearing argument from the prosecutor and the offender, to be included in the report, subject to any contrary regulation made under subsection (2).
&lt;br&gt;
'''Copy of report'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) The clerk of the court shall provide a copy of the report, as soon as practicable after filing, to the offender or counsel for the offender, as directed by the court, and to the prosecutor.
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 721; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 203; 1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1999, c. 25, s. 16(Preamble); 2002, c. 1, s. 183; 2003, c. 21, s. 15.
|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec721 CCC]}}

Under section 724(3)(b), where there is a dispute on factual claims within the report, the party relying upon it must prove the fact.

The purpose of a pre-sentence report is to provide a “picture of the accused as a person in society - his background, family, education, employment record, his physical and mental health, his associates and social activities, and his potentialities and motivations.”&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Riley, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mpw0 1996 CanLII 5615] (NS CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

The function is not to provide evidence of an offence, give details of a criminal record, or tell the court what sentence to give.&lt;ref&gt;
 R. v. Bartkow (1978), 24 N.S.R. (2d) 518, at para. 10
&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge may use the information in the report to assess the character of the accused in order to relate the offence to the accused.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Brown, (1985), 31 Man.R. (2d) 268 per Monnin, C.J., at 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a judge lacks full information on the background of the accused, particularly where the jeopardy of the accused is significant a judge should order a pre-sentence report.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pritchett; R. v. Graham (1969), 9 C.R.N.S. 262 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Samaras (1971), 16 C.R.N.S. 1 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a pre-sentence report should be considered when sentencing a first-time offender.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bates (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 493, 1 W.C.B. 116, 1977 CLB 408 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 494
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, given the general limitations on resources, the judge may want to decline to order a report where there is no specific purpose in ordering one.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Shapley, [1998] S.J. No. 790 (Q.B.), 174 Sask.R. 92, at para. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A simple script for generating the print version which builds upon Kowey's original, mvs-backed, program. To run it under Linux, save the code block contents as a Haskell source file (say, &lt;tt&gt;PrintVersion.hs&lt;/tt&gt;) and follow the instructions in the comments. Other notes:
* Get mw at https://github.com/ianweller/mw .

-- PrintVersion.hs - A simple script for generating the print version
-- of the Haskell Wikibook.
 
-- Originally written in 2007 by Eric Kow and in 2012 by Daniel Mlot.
-- For further information visit
-- &lt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Duplode/Haskell/PrintVersion.hs&gt;.

-- &lt;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&gt;. 


-- Making the print version of the Haskell tutorial wikibook can be a
-- slight pain, so it's nice to automate it.

-- Note that to use this script you will need a copy of mw, which is
-- responsible for talking to the Wikibooks server. mw can be obtained
-- from https://github.com/ianweller/mw . It depends on bzrlib (from
-- bzr, the Bazaar VCS) and python-simplemediawiki 
-- (see https://github.com/ianweller/python-simplemediawiki).
-- Both deps can be found, e.g., on the Fedora repositories).

-- Setting it up
-- -------------
-- mkdir haskell-wikibook
-- cp PrintVersion.hs haskell-wikibook
-- cd haskell-wikibook
-- mw init http://en.wikibooks.org/w/api.php
-- mw pull 'Haskell!Print_version.wiki'

-- Running it
-- ----------
-- cd haskell-wikibook
-- ./PrintVersion.hs
-- mw login
-- mw commit -m &quot;update print version&quot;

| description = The Coal Tit, Periparus ater, is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is a widespread and common resident breeder throughout temperate to subtropical Eurasia and northern Africa.

The Coal Tit is 10–11.5 cm in length, and has a distinctive large white nape spot on its black head. The head, throat and neck of the adult are glossy blue-black, setting off the off-white sides of the face (tinged grey to yellow depending on subspecies) and the brilliant white nape; the white tips of the wing coverts appear as two wingbars. The underparts are whitish shading through buff to rufous on the flanks. The bill is black, the legs lead-coloured, and irides dark brown. The young birds are duller than the adults, lacking gloss on the black head, and with the white of nape and cheeks tinged with yellow.

The Blue Tit is classified as a Least Concern species on the IUCN Red List (version 3.1).

	  PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES
	  NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS
	  PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE

        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statement of Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
	automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
	(defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each
	and all, an &quot;owner&quot;) of an original work of authorship and/or
	a database (each, a &quot;Work&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
	to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of
	creative, cultural and scientific works (&quot;Commons&quot;) that the
	public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
	infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
	reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
	whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
	commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
	Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
	production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to
	gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
	through the use and efforts of others.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and
	without any expectation of additional consideration or
	compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
	&quot;Affirmer&quot;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
	Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects
	to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
	under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
	Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
	effect of CC0 on those rights.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Copyright and Related Rights.&lt;/strong&gt;
	   A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
	   copyright and related or neighboring rights (&quot;Copyright and
	   Related Rights&quot;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but
	   are not limited to, the following: 
	&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ol type=&quot;i&quot;&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,
	  display, communicate, and translate a Work;&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt; moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
	  performer(s);&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
	  image or likeness depicted in a Work;&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
	  to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a),
	  below;&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
	  reuse of data in a Work;&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;database rights (such as those arising under Directive
	  96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
	  March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under
	  any national implementation thereof, including any amended
	  or successor version of such directive); and&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
	  throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
	  any national implementations thereof.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Waiver.&lt;/strong&gt; To the greatest extent
        permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
        Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
        unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
        Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims
        and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
        existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
        the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
        maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
        (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
        future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
        purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
        advertising or promotional purposes (the &quot;Waiver&quot;). Affirmer
        makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public
        at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
        successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
        subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
        or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
        enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
	&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Public License Fallback.&lt;/strong&gt; Should any
        part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
        ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be
        preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
        extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
        affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
        sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
        license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
        in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
        maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
        (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
        future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
        purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
        advertising or promotional purposes (the &quot;License&quot;). The
        License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
        applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
        License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
        ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
        ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
        License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or
        she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
        Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
        associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
        Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement
        of Purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Limitations and Disclaimers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are
          waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise
          affected by this document.&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no
	  representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
	  Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
	  without limitation warranties of title, merchantability,
	  fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the
	  absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present
	  or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
	  the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of
	  other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
	  including without limitation any person's Copyright and
	  Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims
	  responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
	  permissions or other rights required for any use of the
	  Work.&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative
	  Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or
	  obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Paleontology is a job that involves outdoor and indoor work. This about the outdoor field techniques. Before you can dig up a fossil first you must locate the location on a geological map, a geological map is a map in which the sediment is given the time when it was first formed. 
Before you have moved to a promising dig site stop to make sure you have the permission to dig and prospect the land for fossils, remember all land belongs to someone, if it belongs to a family y ou must gain their permission to dig. If it is government owned land and you are in the U.S you will need to gain permission from the Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management departments in the area.              
Not all fossils are under sediment, in fact most of them aren't. Most are broken or chipped fossils that the weather has eroded out of the sediment. Check the base of the terrain to see if any chips have rolled to the bottom of the terrain.     
You will need tools to excavate, transport, and study the fossils that you do find under sediment. some of these tools will be large like shovels and jackhammers to remove the rock surrounding the fossil, and some of them will be small e.g. picks and rock hammers or drills to remove smaller fragments of dirt and rock. Sometimes crumbling fossils need to be glued together in order not to break the fossil.
The next step is to cover the excavated parts of the fossil with wet paper towels and layer plaster coated burlap strips. the paper towels protect the fossil from the plaster. The plaster then dries into a hard shell or jacket that protects the fossil from outside influences. Do this with the rest of the fossil until it is completly jacketed. 
The final step is to label the jacket with the date, time, and specimen. You then will transport the fossil back to the lab with a truck or helicopter if it is really heavy.

==Introduction==
Much of the foundation of criminal law lies in the premise that the accused had a requisite &quot;mens rea&quot; (or guilty state of mind) when committing the offence. In principle a person should only be convicted of an offence for which they had some degree of awareness or intention when committing the criminal act. This is closely tied to the theory of moral culpability which is what criminal law is attempting to address and as such is constitutionally required under s. 7 of the Charter.

The criminal law generally does not include offences for which the accused was not subjectively aware to some degree of the offence. Further, there is no duty of precaution upon an individual to ensure that they do not perform the illegal act without their intent or knowledge. This is in contrast to regulatory offences and other forms of civil liability which generally require only an objective standard of responsibility. This is known as a &quot;duty of care&quot; and &quot;standard of care&quot;. The duty of care is the legal obligation to maintain a certain standard. The standard of care is the specific standard of conduct that is imposed by law upon an individual which, if violated, could result in liability of some sort or another.

==Duty of Care==
Certain criminal offences create a duty of care, where, if the standard of care is violated, will result in a criminal act. The offences that impose a duty of care include:
# [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Unsafe Storage of a Firearm|unsafe storage of a firearm]] (86)
# [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Criminal Negligence|Criminal negligence]] (219)
# [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle|dangerous operation of a motor vehicle]] 249

==Standard of Care==
The modern foundation of duty of care in criminal law originated from the case of R v Hundal [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs58 1993 CanLII 120] (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867. The case stated that to determine whether an act violated a standard of care requires a &quot;modified objective test&quot;&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Hundal, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs58 1993 CanLII 120] (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867, at page 887&lt;/ref&gt;

For any offence where the standard of care involves objectively dangerous conduct, the conduct must be shown to be a &quot;marked departure&quot; from the the norm. Wherein a &quot;reasonable person in the position of the accused would have been aware of the risk&quot; and &quot;would not have undertaken the activity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Beatty, [http://canlii.ca/t/1vrp5 2008 SCC 5], [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49 &lt;/ref&gt;
The assessment, then, is of a &quot;reasonably prudent person in the circumstances&quot; the accused found himself when the events occurred.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Beatty, [http://canlii.ca/t/1vrp5 2008 SCC 5], [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49  at 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if the accused actions' show a marked departure from the standard of care described in the offence provision, he still cannot be convicted if a reasonably prudent person in the position of the accused would not have been aware of the risk or would not have been able to avoid the creating the risk.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Tayfel (M.), 2009 MBCA 124 (CanLII), &lt;http://canlii.ca/t/273wk&gt; at 51&lt;/ref&gt;

This standard was determined to be constitutionally acceptable.&lt;Ref&gt;

R. v. Tutton and Tutton, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ft5f 1989 CanLII 103], [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392&lt;/ref&gt;

== Font size ==
I don't know the reason but if you find the font size an issue for your editing, you can try a local solution in place of increasing the size of the general text (that will clash with the rest of the content on other pages). If you are using Firefox (or a Firefox derivative) browser the No Squint extension will permit a by site configuration of text size. You can also use a personalized skin in your preferences on Wikibooks that shapes how content is displayed.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:36, 17 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Certain offences in the criminal code require not only that the offender do a prohibited act along with the requisite mens rea, but also that the act caused a particular result. 
Criminal responsibility for causation must be established in fact and in law.&lt;Ref&gt; 
R. v. Nette, [http://canlii.ca/t/51x9 2001 SCC 78], [2001] 3 S.C.R. 488, at para. 44
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This makes a distinction between the physical, biological, or medical cause a particular result and the legal boundary that would attribute responsibility to the accused for the result. 

The standard to prove causation is the same as between all homicide offences, including murder, manslaughter, operation of a motor vehicle causing death.&lt;ref&gt;R v K.L., [http://canlii.ca/t/22h4n 2009 ONCA 141] at [http://canlii.ca/t/22h4n#par17 17]&lt;/reF&gt; Likewise, the standard applies equally to offences involving bodily harm.

The criminal standard of causation in criminal matters is that the &quot;accused's  conduct be at least a contributing cause of the [result], outside the de minimis range&quot;&lt;reF&gt;
R v K.L., [http://canlii.ca/t/22h4n 2009 ONCA 141] at 17 citing: &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Smithers, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mk9r 1977 CanLII 7] (SCC), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 506 at p. 519&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Nette, [http://canlii.ca/t/51x9 2001 SCC 78] (CanLII), [2001] 3 S.C.R. 488 at paras. 71 and 72&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law does not include any issues of contributory negligence nor does it apportion responsibility for harm caused outside of sentencing.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Nette [http://canlii.ca/t/51x9 2001 SCC 78] at para. 49&lt;br&gt;
R. v. K. L., [http://canlii.ca/t/22h4n 2009 ONCA 141] at 18&lt;/ref&gt; 

The inference of foreseeability can be rebutted with evidence of intoxication.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Seymour, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr9z 1996 CanLII 201], [1996] 2 SCR 252 at para. 23&lt;br&gt;
See R. v. Daley, [http://canlii.ca/t/1v5dr 2007 SCC 53], [2007] 3 SCR 523 for details on the law of intoxication&lt;br&gt;

==Causation in Homicide==
Homicide is defined in s.222(1) as occurring where a person &quot;directly or indirectly, by any means, ... causes the death of a human being.&quot;. Culpable Homicide (i.e. murder, manslaughter, or infanticide) is defined in section 222(5) as &quot;when [a person] causes the death of a human being...by means of an unlawful act&quot;.

Causation is explicitly identified as existing where the death might have been otherwise &quot;been prevented by resorting to proper means&quot;(s. 224) or where the immediate cause of death is proper or improper treatment applied in good faith (s.225) or where the victim is already suffering from a terminal condition. (s 226)

The &quot;Smithers test&quot; for causation applies to all types of homicide.  The test requires that the accused's act be a &quot;significant contributing cause&quot; of death beyond something trifling or minor. Thus, the unlawful act remains the legal cause of death even where the act by itself would not have cause death as long as it was beyond the de minimus. &lt;ref&gt;
R v Smithers, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mk9r 1977 CanLII 7], [1978] 1 SCR 506 - defines manslaughter as “a contributing cause of death, outside the de minimis range” (p. 519)&lt;br&gt;
R v Nette [http://canlii.ca/t/51x9 2001 SCC 78] at 71-72
&lt;/ref&gt;

By implication, causation is in no way limited to a direct, an immediate, or the most significant cause.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Maybin, [http://canlii.ca/t/frczg 2012 SCC 24] at para 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the offence is &quot;constructive murder&quot; under s. 231(5), that there is an added requirement.&lt;ref&gt; R v Nette at 73&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is made between factual causation and legal causation.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Kippax, [http://canlii.ca/t/fp7n6 2011 ONCA 766], [2011] O.J. 5494 at 22 to 27&lt;/ref&gt; The former being the broader of the two.  
*''Factual causation'' requires &quot;an inquiry about how the victim came to his or her death, in a medical, mechanical, or physical sense, and with the contribution of the accused to that result&quot; (Nette, at para. 44) To put it simply, the question is &quot;but for&quot; the act would death have arose? &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Maybin, [http://canlii.ca/t/frczg 2012 SCC 24] at para 15&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Legal Causation'' addresses the moral element of whether the accused &quot;should be held responsible in law for the death&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nette at para. 45&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Intervening Acts===
The doctrine of intervening acts can limit the scope of legal causation. The law recognizes an intervening cause that &quot;'break the chain of causation' between the accused's acts and the death&quot; which results in the &quot;accused’s actions not being a significant contributing cause of death&quot; &lt;ref&gt;R v Tower [http://canlii.ca/t/1vn7l 2008 NSCA 3] at para 25&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==
Irving Fisher coined the phrase in his article &quot;Money Illusion&quot; in the early 20th century &lt;ref name=Thaler&gt; Thaler, Richard H. The American Economic Review, Vol.87, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the Hundred and Fourth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;. He defined explicity the problem that many people think in nominal instead of real values, or as the case may be, in a mix of the two. The ease &lt;ref name=Eldar&gt; Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; of using nominal thinking makes this problem widespread, especially when it occurs during times of hyperinflation that Irving Fisher studied. Alternative framinings of the same situation (one in nominal and one in real) can lead to different choices because people adhere to the frame presented to them&lt;ref name=FehrTyran2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fehr|first1=Ernst|last2= Tyran|first2=Jean-Robert|year=2001|title=Does Money Illusion Matter?|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=91|issue=5 |pages=1239-1262|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2677924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This problem leads to poor economic choices and an inadequate view of prices and costs. While inflation is the most common lense to view money illusion, sunk costs is also prominant and it comes in many forms: not accepting a lower wage, not selling at a marginal loss, investment, mental accounting, and even fairness &lt;ref name=Eldar&gt; Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;. Though, this theory is not strictly a behavioral problem. Macroeconomists use this insight in their analysis of peoples reaction to inflation and how that effects monetary policy and compare the effects to negative interest rates &lt;ref&gt; The Economist. &quot;The Buck Shrinks Here.&quot; The Economist. The Economist Newspaper, 16 Apr. 2012. Web. 23 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/04/monetary-policy-0&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;. And psychological insights are very important in understanding why money illusion occurs, especially in cases where framing[[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/wiki/Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Framing_Effect]] risk aversion plays a role (investing and transactions) &lt;ref name=Eldar&gt; Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;. Central to the problem of money illusion is the lack of economic education, but even with education or learning nominal values are still used.

==Specific Examples==
In this section, we will dissect a select couple of examples of money illusion that have been studied over the years.
===Earnings===
Shafir, Diamond, and Tversky&lt;ref name=Eldar&gt;Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;, created a situation to test people's understanding of money illusion in wage earnings. There are two people who have the same college experience, same type of job, same starting wage, yet experience different percentage rates of inflation and bonus. 


Person 1: $30,000 base salary, 0% inflation (the first year), 2% rise in salary (second year)

Person 2: $30,000 base salary, 4% inflation (the first year), 5% rise in salary (second year)


In strictly real terms, Person 1 is better off than Person 2 as they receive a higher wage after inflation is taken into account, while Person 2 has more &quot;money&quot; in a nominal sense but after taking into account inflation Person 2's money is worth less. 

The questions asked of the participants, who had to evaluate Person 1 and Person 2, had to answer three questions, one on &quot;economic terms&quot;, happiness and job attractiveness. In response to the first question about who was doing better in &quot;economic terms&quot;, the majority sided with Person 1, which is correct in real terms. But in response to the next question on who was happier, respondents (different people from question one) said Person 2 was happier even though the majority of earlier respondents acknowledged that Person 1 was better off. This answer clearly shows the nominal bias: people assume a larger bonus means more money which in turn makes them happier. The third question reinforces this concept. Another set of respondents were asked who would be more likely to leave their job and the majority said Person 1. This response also shows nominal bias because Person 1 is actually receiving a greater bonus once inflation is taken into account. 

The surveys indicated that people in fact do use nominal values to create judgements. But when a question was framed that emphasized who would be better off in &quot;economic terms&quot; people answered correctly saying Person 1 was better off. This means people do think in real terms when they are reminded of it, but the bias is toward nominal in all other cases.

===Mental Accounting===
Mental accounting[[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Mental_Accounting&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1]] is a topic in and of itself and more can be learned by accessing the link provided. This example with be looking at Shafir, Diamond, and Tversky's,&lt;ref name=Eldar&gt;Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;surveys assessing people's responses to past nominal values and sunk costs. People have difficulty disassociating past costs with the present and are unsure of what to make of the connection between the two. This lead to a variety of answers and a lack of consensus. So the authors developed a second question. Two stores buy the same quantity of goods at different input prices and sell them at different output prices. One of the two buys and sells his a year later with inflation. 


Store A: Bought 100 goods for $20 each and sold them at $44 each
:-A Year Later-
Store B: Bought 100 goods for $22 each and sold them at $45 each-while experiencing 10% inflation


An overwhelming majority when asked &quot;who made the better deal?&quot; selected Store A over Store B. This makes sense thinking in nominal terms as you multiply the quantity times the output price and subtract the quantity times the input price. Then you repeat for both stores:

Store A:((100 quantity of goods)x($44 output price))-((100 quantity of goods)x($20 input price))= $2,400
Store B:((100 quantity of goods)x($45 output price))-((100 quantity of goods)x($22 input price))= $2,300

Under this logic (ignoring inflation) it is easy to see that the easier line of nominal thinking is very persuasive. Aknowledging inflation, the price of the input was offset by the rise inflation allowing for more money to be made by only increasing the output price by one dollar. Money illusion shows it's hand by illustrating, once again, that people instinctively think in nominal terms.

===Experimental Monetary Shock===

It is disputed as to whether exogenous monetary shocks in the &quot;real world&quot; have a real impact on output as it is still highly debated&lt;ref name=FehrTyran2001/&gt;, but Fehr and Tyran ran their experiment in a lab acknowledging that field data would be filled with skepticism. The model they constructed was to have an &quot;exogenous&quot; and expected monetary shock. In the experiment, participants play against other players and the computer (removing any need to act off of uncertainty) to set set prices and trade with each other. They select a number (1-30) and then select the price's expectation, as well as, the confidence in thier decision. To prepare to analyze the situation, they tested the people before, during and after the negative shock on the money supply. The &quot;pre-shock&quot; test was used for getting participants familiar with the system and using it to compare to the &quot;post shock&quot; price. 

The results of their experiment showed: 
* With real values against computers, the shock had no almost no effect on prices with players having to make very minimal adjustments to equilibrium. 
* With nominal values against computers, the shock created a limited amount of money illusion as it became harder for participants to get back to equillibrium.
* With real values against other participants, the shock had a limited effect on prices but there were fluxuations. 
* With nominal values against other participants, the shock had an astounding effect on prices creating such variance that the participants never reached equillibrium.

To conclude it is evident that money illusion plays a part in peoples decision making and has an even more drastic effect in a nominal frame. Even in a fully expected drop in the quantity of money still lead to large income losses for participants until they got closer to equilibrium. The same researchers conducted a study on positive economic shocks as well but the effects of money illusion were much smaller.

==Conclusions==
We can conclude that there is no easy solution to the problem of money illusion. Attempts to reconcile the lack in logic with economic education or to pursue policies that have very little inflation have not been very successful&lt;ref name =Thaler&gt;Thaler, Richard H. The American Economic Review, Vol.87, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the Hundred and Fourth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association (May, 1997),440&lt;/ref&gt;. Money illusion, though has immense policy and business implications especially when contracts, and even tax methods are incorrectly indexed. It is an especially complicated ordeal for businesses who wish to raise prices to combat inflation but do not want to confront the public who views in anger any nominal price rise.&lt;ref name=Eldar&gt;Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Macroeconomists will continue to struggle with the concept of money illusion in their explanations of short term changes in equilibrium prices&lt;ref name=FehrTyran2001/&gt;. Behavioral economists still have much to research empirically about money illusion and to find evidence of it outside of the laboratory or questionaire setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm Philovitist! I've been in love with Wikipedia for a while, but have only just recently become a Wikipedian — all under the guise of studying for my upcoming IB exams. 

I'd also like to help develop a wikibooks for JROTC (particularly NJROTC) since I am well-versed in that program. But maybe later. 

For now, focusing on IB Economics. Afterwards, I'll shift to IB Biology or History. Or maybe instead I'll develop the General IB Program Wikibook. We'll see!</text>

Computer hardware can be inherently fragile.  Heat, water, and physical accidents are the biggest threats to a computer's physical safety.  Computers should be properly cleaned on a regular basis to keep dust buildup to a minimum (this protects the unit from excessive heat).  Care must also be taken when liquids are used around a computer.  Finally, dropping a computer (or most electronic components) can be the kiss of death for the machine.

Besides being fragile, computers are also very valuable.  Care must be taken to protect computers from theft.  Various locks are available to protect a computer from theft.  In addition, there are special tracking systems that can be used to find a computer if it is stolen or misplaced.  And for the “nuclear” approach, there are self-destructing devices that become unusable if stolen!

==How to Prevent Your Computer From Crashing==

There are ways to prevent your computer from crashing although this isn’t a guarantee. If your computer crashes it can affect your schedule for those that depend on it for daily activities may cause a loss of data, damage your system and data files and my leave your computer unbootable.

At times rebooting may help or solve the problem but if you haven’t backed up your computer you may be in trouble.

However, at times, computer crashes may occur due to user negligence that may result in virus infections, a damaged registry, or hard disk problems. You can easily prevent computer freeze problems due to this, by performing regular PC maintenance. Let us have look at some of the tasks that you can perform to prevent and recover from computer crashes.



There are a few steps that can be taken to protect your computers hardware. You should first install and use security software. Then you should back up your system regularly. Another step to protecting your hardware is to update your operating system, browser, and e-mail program regularly as well. Finally, test your system for vulnerabilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most of this is good notes from which an actually good wikibook can be developed. However, there are things here not mentioned in the Syllabus and the information selected for 'basic definitions' seems arbitrary. Superfluous entries I think should be removed unless later used for didactic reasons will be stored on this discussion page. After checking, though, it's clear that all relevant section one information is present.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">                  VISCO ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF POLYMERS AND PLASTICS

The measurement of Viscoelastic properties of polymers and plastics are most commonly done on dilute solutions or molten polymers, and are critical for determining molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and degree of branching), processing behavior and end product performance.

The most common device used for measuring viscoelastic properties of melt polymers is a melt index, which is an empirical method that provides a single point measurement of viscosity. The melt index (MI) actually is the amount of material which flows through a capillary under a standard set of conditions (temperature, pressure and time). While it is most often used as a simple, quick way to grade the relative differences between polymers and plastics in a quality control environment, its limitations are that it is not very sensitive to differences in molecular architecture and provides little useful information to simulate how a polymer or plastic will behave in a process.

Polymers are complex rheological materials in that they exhibit both viscous and elastic (viscoelastic) properties under varying conditions of stress, strain and temperature. The best example of a material with viscoelastic properties is silly putty (or PDMS) – when left “at rest” in a lump, when time and natural forces of gravity are applied, it eventually flows like a fluid (albeit slowly) to form a puddle. Yet, when rolled into a ball and bounced, it behaves like an elastic solid. Lastly, when stretched rapidly, it snaps and breaks cleanly as if it was a solid piece of plastic. This demonstrates the importance of measuring the rheological properties of polymers and platsics under varying conditions of stress, strain and time if we want to understand how they will perform in a process or end use conditions.

Typically, stress and/or strain-controlled, rotational rheometers are used to measure properties such as:

viscoelasticity (G’, G’’, tan delta) as a function of frequency (time) and temperature
molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution,, branching) using frequency sweeps and creep/recovery tests (zero shear viscosity)
influence of long chain branching on linear viscoelastic properties (zero shear viscosity, steady state recoverable compliance)
Also, capillary rheometers are used to measure:

shear viscosity from low to high shear rates, directly simulating conditions experienced during processing
melt fracture, die swell, and shark skin which are often due on elastic properties that manifest themselves at high shear rates during processing
extensional viscosity and/or melt strength, which become important parameters to measure for many polymer processes.</text>

{{TOC right}}

Assembly refers to putting together parts or component systems to make a functional complete device.  Construction refers to permanent installations not intended to move often or ever and consisting of many devices and systems.  These tasks typically consist of many simple steps in series.


==Assembly Methods==

Assembly methods can be organized by the type of operator and the type of connections are made between elements

===Operator Types===

Assembly methods can be categorized by the type of operator that performs the assembly:

* '''Manual Assembly''' - This is performed by humans using manual dexterity and strength. It can be assisted by tools and fixtures for leverage, speed, and positioning.
* '''Robotic Assembly''' - This is performed by robots either under human remote control or computer control.
* '''Automatic Assembly''' - This is where the devices to perform the assembly task are built into the components.

===Mechanical Connections===

===Electrical Connections===

===Fluid Connections===


==Construction Methods==

Construction can be organized by analogy to Earth construction, with suitable modifications

===Construction Planning===

===Logistics===

Delivering construction equipment and supplies to the construction site from other locations.

====Orbital Tugs====

When launching multiple components from Earth that need to be collected in one place for assembly, if the orbits are similar, then a single vehicle dedicated to the job is more efficient than including a propulsion and navigation system on each component payload &lt;ref&gt;Gralla and De Weck [http://strategic.mit.edu/docs/2_20_JBIS_60_6_219_Tugs.pdf '''Strategies for On-Orbit Assembly of Modular Spacecraft'''], JBIS, vol 60, p 219, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;.  We call that vehicle an '''Orbital Tug'''.  Besides propulsion, navigation, and means to grab the payloads, it needs the ability to periodically refuel.  This can be done with occasional payloads being fuel tanks, which the Tug attaches to itself as needed.  In order not to be left stranded, it should have at least two tank locations, and install a fresh tank while the second one still has some fuel left.  If you have more than one Tug, they should be designed to grab each other for heavier cargos needing more total propulsion, or in case one stops working and needs to be returned for repair.

===Materials Handling===

Positioning items within the construction site to the point of use.

====Docking====

Mechanical Docking Systems

====Deployment====

Unpacking a component shipped in a compact state to an operating configuration.

===Site Work===

Where you are doing construction on or near a natural body, and you need to modify the construction area by road-building, excavation, and other methods.

===Cast and Block Structures===

These are not pressure tight structures, but installed by methods like casting concrete or stacking blocks

===Fabricated Structures===

These are from metal, wood, plastic, or other materials delivered as components to be assembled on site

==Outfitting Methods==

Outfitting involves installing and activating items within a larger construction element once it is in place.

===Sealing and Protection===

===Utilities Installation===

===Equipment Installation===

===Habitation Setup===

===Activation===

      <comment>/* Example Of A Conversation In The Tsugaru Dialect */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Tsugaru Dialect (津軽弁 / つがるべん / tsugaru-ben)is a Japanese dialect spoken in Tsugaru, the western region of the Aomori Prefecture. There are often times when Tsugaru dialect is mistaken for &quot;Aomori Dialect.&quot; Assuming that this dialect is used throughout the entire
prefrecture is a misconception.
Tsugaru-ben is reputed to be too divergent from standard Japanese for those who are not native speakers, to the point that even people living in the same prefecture may have trouble understanding it. 
In 1988, fans of the Tsugaru dialect proclaimed October 23 to be Tsugaru Dialect Day (津軽弁の日 Tsugaru-ben no hi). 
October 23 is the anniversary of the death of Kyōzō Takagi, a famous poet who wrote in the Tsugaru dialect.
In Tsuruta, there is an annual summer Tsugaru-ben competition (津軽弁大会 Tsugaru-ben taikai) in which teams of foreigners create short skits or performances, usually humorous, using Tsugaru-ben.
In June 2009, a short segment featuring the competition was broadcast nationally on Japan Broadcasting Corporation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ruggedized devices are devices that are designed to withstand much more physical abuse than conventional devices and range from semirugged to ultrarugged. These devices are usually used for consumers whose needs for protection aren’t met with just a regular protective case. For example, most police cars are equipped with portable laptops that have been ruggedized due to the nature of their jobs. Semirugged devices typically have more durable cases and are spill resistant. The ultrarugged devices are designed to withstand falls from three feet or more onto concrete, extreme temperature ranges, wet conditions, and use while being bounced around over rough terrain in a vehicle. Ultrarugged devices are usually used by construction workers and outdoor technicians whose jobs put them in unpredictable working conditions.
{{BookCat}}

However, you don’t have to purchase a ruggedized device in order to amp up your portable device’s ability to withstand a toddler’s errant hand or an unlikely fall into a water receptacle.

Common sense goes a long way.  Keep your devices out of dusty areas and away from water.  Also, don’t leave your device where it will be subject to extreme heat or cold.  

Thin layers of sheeting that will provide protection from scratches can be purchased to cover screens.    And, if there is a device that has been made, then there is most likely a customized protective case to go with it.  Everything from hard cases to soft cases to protective sleeves exists in the marketplace.

Although there is no guarantee against a shattered screen or a trip through a laundry cycle, owning either a ruggedized device or accessorizing it with the latest protective wear and keeping your portable device in a safe environment will help ensure your hardware is protected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pretty much the only thing this page gets right is that luac exists.

Lua bytecodes are *not* portable in any useful sense, they are decidedly ideosyncratic to not ''just'' host platform, but the specific build of lua/luac that created that them. lua bytecode has no defined standard and thus any interoperability of its bytecodes is effectively accidental. Some alternate lua librarys, such as luajit, don't even use bytecodes in the first place.

Granted, you can ''usually'' get away with it...but its not anything you can or should actually rely on.
This is not a contentious point, the source makes no attempt at all to shield the bytecodes from changes due to so much as compiler options, let alone platform. and this is a fact well recognised in the official lua IRC channel and the lua mailing list (both frequented and maintained by the lua devs themselves) [[Special:Contributions/210.4.231.20|210.4.231.20]] ([[User talk:210.4.231.20|discuss]]) 14:02, 19 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Systems of Numbers */ decapitalizing &quot;algebra&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Systems of Numbers ==

Geometric algebra is an example of a system of numbers. In particular, it's an example of what mathematicians call an '''algebra over a field'''. But since this is not intended to be a book solely for mathematicians, this page is here as an attempt to explain what exactly this means, give a general impression of what systems of numbers are and how they can be built up, and show where geometric algebra fits in. You probably already know most of what's in this section, and it is presented primarily for comparison's sake, but seeing it presented in this way may raise some interesting questions.

Perhaps the most basic system of numbers is the natural, or counting, numbers. This is the familiar set of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. One of the fundamental properties of the natural numbers is that for every natural number ''n'', there is a natural number ''n'' + 1 (which is never equal to ''n'') that comes after it. Since this is true no matter how big ''n'' is, there are infinitely many natural numbers. We'll call the first number that comes after ''n'' the '''successor''' of ''n''. One reason this property is fundamental to the natural numbers is that any natural number can be represented by the successor function applied to 0 some number of times. In fact if you have another set of things in which each one has a successor and there is only one that is not the successor of any other, your set of things can be identified with the natural numbers -- just call the thing that isn't the successor of anything else 0, and go from there. Another reason the successor operation is fundamental is that the basic operations of addition and multiplication can be reduced to it. The sum of two natural numbers ''a'' and ''b'' is the ''b''th successor of ''a''. Likewise, the product of ''a'' and ''b'' is the sum of ''a'' and itself repeated ''b'' times. ''a'' to the power of ''b'' is defined similarly, as the product of ''a'' with itself repeated ''b'' times.

The operations of addition and multiplication that we've introduced have a few important properties in common. If you add three numbers, it doesn't matter whether you start by adding the first and second numbers, and then add the third one to your answer, or if you start by adding the second and third numbers, and then add your answer to the first number. In equation form, this is (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c''). The corresponding statement is true for multiplication. That is, ''a''(''bc'') = (''ab'')''c''. This is called  the '''associative property''', since it is a statement of the fact that it doesn't matter in which order the terms (or factors) are associated. Both versions of the associative property are true for all natural numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. A statement that is true for all values of the variables in it is called an '''identity''', and mathematicians sometimes say that it is ''identically true'' or ''holds identically.'' This can be confusing because it conflicts with the everyday definition of ''identical'', but the meaning is usually clear in context.

Another important identity that's true for both addition and multiplication is the '''commutative property''', which is the statement that the order in which you add (or multiply) two numbers doesn't matter. That is, for all natural numbers ''a'' and ''b'', ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' and ''ab'' = ''ba''. Also, for all natural numbers ''a'', 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' + 0 = ''a'' and 1''a'' = ''a''1 = a. Because of this, 0 is called the '''identity element''' for addition and 1 is called the identity element for multiplication -- yet another sense of the word ''identity.'' An important identity that relates multiplication to addition is the '''distributive property''', the statement that, for all natural numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', ''a''(''b'' + ''c'') = ''ab'' + ''ac''.

In the fairly recent past, mathematicians have begun to study sets of &quot;numbers&quot; that share some or all of these properties (including ones we'll discuss later on), and have come up with names for certain combinations of properties. Any set of elements with an operation that satisfies the associative property and has an identity element is called a '''monoid'''. In particular, the natural numbers with addition form what is called (for rather obvious reasons) a ''commutative'' monoid. The natural numbers with multiplication also form a commutative monoid, but of a rather different sort. To see the difference, notice that any natural number can be formed by adding 1 and 0 in various combinations, but there is no (finite) set of numbers that you can build all natural numbers out of using multiplication in a similar way. There are, however, infinite sets with this property -- take, for instance, the set containing 0, 1, and all prime numbers.

=== Inverses and Groups ===
One of the most basic questions we can ask about natural numbers is this: given two natural numbers ''a'' and ''b'', what is a number that, when added to ''a'', gives ''b''? Let's call this the subtraction problem for the pair (''a'', ''b''). There is never more than one natural number that answers the subtraction problem for a given pair (''a'', ''b''); we call that number, if it exists, ''b'' - ''a''. For example, the answer to the question &quot;What number, when added to 6, gives 13?&quot; is 13 - 6 = 7. But suppose we ask &quot;What number, when added to 12, gives 9?&quot; There is no answer. None of the numbers ''n'' in the set we have just constructed has the property that 12 + ''n'' = 9. But suppose there were such a number. If it obeyed all the same rules as the natural numbers, we would be able to say that it also satisfies 20 + ''n'' = 17, since 9 = 9, and therefore 8 + 9 = 8 + 9 -- but 12 + ''n'' = 9, so 8 + (12 + ''n'') = 8 + 9. Using the associative property, we can show that this means (8 + 12) + ''n'' = 8 + 9, and so, since we know 8 + 12 is 20 and 8 + 9 is 17, 20 + ''n'' = 17. By running the same kind of reasoning in reverse, we can show that our number ''n'' must also satisfy 3 + ''n'' = 0. Symbolically, then, we can say that our number is 0 - 3, since it solves our original problem for 3 and 0 just as 13 - 6 = 7 solves it for 6 and 13. Usually, we drop the 0 and write this number as -3. By adding the numbers -''n'' for all natural numbers ''n'' greater than 0 to our set, we end up with a  solution for the subtraction problem, not only for the pairs (''n'', 0), but for all pairs of numbers (''a'', ''b'') in our new set. (Notice that we don't have to add -0 because the subtraction problem already has a solution for the pair (0, 0) - namely 0.)

We need to be careful here to make sure that what we're talking about -- the set of integers -- actually exists, and that we can define addition and multiplication in a meaningful way on this new set of numbers. (Of course, the integers are a well-known system, and you almost certainly already know how to add and multiply them, but this is intended as a demonstration and a clarification.) One way to do this is to represent a number by the set of pairs for which it satisfies the subtraction problem. We do this by putting together a set of rules that tell us whether two pairs represent the same number -- what mathematicians call an '''equivalence relation'''. In this case, we'll say that the pair (''a'', ''b'') is equivalent to the pair (''c'', ''d'') if and only if (''a'' + ''d'' = ''b'' + ''c''). Then, writing ''b'' - ''a'' for the set of pairs related to (''a'', ''b''), we define addition and multiplication by the rules we want them to follow: (''b'' - ''a'') + (''d'' - ''c'') = (''b'' + ''d'') - (''a'' + ''c'') and (''b'' - ''a'')(''d'' - ''c'') = (''ac'' + ''bd'') - (''ad'' + ''bc''). Now all we have to do is name the sets ''n'' and -''n'' for each natural number ''n'', and this is easy - just let ''n'' be the set of pairs we've been calling ''n'' - 0 and -''n'' be the set of pairs 0 - ''n''. (Can you see how this all fits together? Hint: Try drawing a picture.)

Our new set of numbers, with addition, has a new, important property -- every integer has an '''inverse element''', or a number that it can be added to to get the identity (that is, 0). A monoid with this property is called a '''group''' -- a name which can be confusing, especially since the everyday meaning of ''group'', unlike the mathematical definition, has no notion of structure associated with it. A commutative group, like the integers, is also called an '''Abelian group''', after the mathematician [[w:Niels Henrik Abel|Niels Henrik Abel]].

One question we may want to ask about integers is the equivalent of the subtraction problem for multiplication: the division problem. Given a pair of integers (''a'', ''b''), it asks what number, when multiplied by a, gives b. We call the answer to the division problem for a pair (''a'', ''b''), if it exists, ''b''/''a''. If we treat the division problem just as we treated the subtraction problem for natural numbers, we end up with a new set of numbers, the rational numbers, in which every number other than 0 has a multiplicative inverse element 1/''a''. A set, like the rational numbers, with an addition operation with which it is an Abelian group and a multiplication operation with which its set of nonzero elements is a group is called a '''field'''.

=== Magnitudes and the Continuum ===

The process by which we extended the natural numbers to the integers and then the rational numbers was one of abstraction and generalization: If a solution to an equation existed and obeyed the rules we had already learned about numbers, it had to have certain properties. Once we knew all the properties it would have to have, we could build a new set of numbers in which it did exist. We can carry this process even further. Some equations cannot be solved by rational numbers, for example &lt;math&gt;x^2=2&lt;/math&gt;. In introducing irrational numbers into our system, let's go a bit further than we strictly have to by allowing numbers with any decimal expansion as part of our set, which we'll call the real numbers. The real numbers have some interesting properties: every positive real number has a real root (of every order) and a real logarithm, and they are complete in the sense that for every set of real numbers, you can find exactly one number that's greater than every other number in the set and smaller than every other number with this property. You can't do this for all sets of rational numbers -- for example, it fails for the set 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ..., which contains infinitely many numbers that approach &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. One of their most interesting properties is that you can assign exactly one real number to every point on a line and cover the entire line. Somehow along the way in this process of abstraction and generalization, numbers have turned from something we use only for counting to something we can use to describe shapes, and this is the concept geometric algebra is based on.

=== Complex Numbers ===
[[Image:Complex number illustration.svg|thumb|right|Complex numbers can be visualized as points in a plane.]]

As you may know, the real numbers aren't the end of the story. There are still equations that can't be solved by any real numbers, for example &lt;math&gt;x^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;. In order to solve equations like this, we will introduce a number &lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The new set of numbers we build using &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, which includes all numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;a+bi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers, is called the complex numbers. &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is quite a remarkable invention. For one thing, it's the last hoop we have to jump through -- every algebraic equation has a solution in the complex numbers. For this reason, we say that the complex numbers are ''algebraically closed''.

Since complex numbers aren't as familiar as the other sets of numbers we've discussed, I'll talk briefly about how to work with them. To find the sum of two complex numbers, we use the distributive property and the associative and commutative properties of addition:

&lt;math&gt;(a+bi)+(c+di)=a+bi+c+di=a+c+bi+di=(a+c)+(b+d)i&lt;/math&gt;.

To find their product, we use the distributive property and the fact that &lt;math&gt;i^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;(a+bi)(c+di)=a(c+di)+bi(c+di)=ac+adi+bci+bdi^2=(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i&lt;/math&gt;.

Finding the difference of two complex numbers is simple as long as you remember to distribute the negative sign to both parts of the number, but division is a little more complicated. You have to use a little trick to turn the bottom of the fraction into a real number:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+bi}{c+di}=\left(\frac{a+bi}{c+di}\right)1=\left(\frac{a+bi}{c+di}\right)\left(\frac{c-di}{c-di}\right)=\frac{(ac+bd)i+(-ad+bc)i}{(c^2+d^2)-(cd-cd)i}=\left(\frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2}\right)+\left(\frac{-ad+bc}{c^2+d^2}\right)i&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Vector Addition.svg|200px|left|thumb|Addition of two complex numbers can be done geometrically by constructing a parallelogram.]]

[[File:ComplexMultiplication.png|right|thumb|Multiplication of 2+''i'' (blue triangle) and 3+''i'' (red triangle). The red triangle is rotated to match the vertex of the blue one and stretched by √{{overline|5}}, the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of the blue triangle.]]

We call the complex number &lt;math&gt;c-di&lt;/math&gt;, which you had to multiply by on the top and the bottom as part of that trick, the '''complex conjugate''' of &lt;math&gt;c+di&lt;/math&gt;.

Like the real numbers, the complex numbers have a natural geometric interpretation -- they can be thought of as points in a plane. The standard representation of the complex plane is with the real line running horizontally and the line of real multiples of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; running vertically, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; above the real line and &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt; below it. Geometrically, the sum of two complex numbers can be constructed in the same way as the sum of two vectors -- draw a parallelogram with two of its sides running from the origin (that is, 0) to the numbers you are adding. The point of the parallelogram opposite the origin is the sum of the two complex numbers. The rule for multiplication is a little more complicated: first, construct a right triangle for each of the numbers being multiplied, with one of its vertices at the origin, one at the endpoint of the complex number, and one along the real axis (at the point representing the real part of the complex number). Rotate one of these triangles until the leg that was on the real axis is parallel to the hypotenuse of the other triangle, and then scale it by a factor equal to the length of the hypotenuse of the other triangle. The tip of this triangle represents the product of the two complex numbers.

When we interpret complex numbers as points (or vectors) in a plane, it makes sense to introduce the concept of absolute value, which we will define exactly as we did for real numbers: the distance between a number and 0. The absolute value of a complex number is also called its '''modulus'''. Notice that there's a complication: more often than not, a complex number is situated along a diagonal, and so we have to use the Pythagorean theorem to find this distance. For example,

&lt;math&gt;|1+i|=\sqrt{(1)^2+(1)^2}=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Complex conjugates come in handy here. As we saw in the division rule, the product of a complex number and its conjugate is always real. What's more, ''it's equal to the square of the complex number's absolute value''. So we can simply multiply a complex number by its conjugate and then take the square root to find its absolute value. Here's a little demonstration of why this works algebraically:

&lt;math&gt;(a+bi)(a-bi)=a(a-bi)+bi(a-bi)=a^2-abi+abi-b^2i^2=a^2-b^2(-1)=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;.

See if you can work out the geometric proof for yourself. Note that taking the complex conjugate of a number amounts to reflecting it across the real axis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ==

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows for manual and automatic assignment of IP addresses (see IETF rfc 2131 &amp; 2132). DHCP is enacted when a new machine joins a network or an existing machine attempts to renew its IP address. DHCP is an extension of an older protocol known as the &quot;bootstrap protocol&quot; (BOOTP) and is backwards compatible with BOOTP. There are three methods of IP address allocation:

    Manual:     An administrator manually assigns the IP address; tedious but most secure method.

    Automatic:  DHCP server assigns permanent IP address to requesting client.

    Dynamic:    DHCP server &quot;leases&quot; IP address to requesting client. The IP address is only valid for a limited period of time;
                after which the client must request a renewal or ask for a new IP address.

By far the most common (and most detailed) method is the dynamic method, which we'll focus our attention on. A typical sequence for a new client requesting an IP address is shown in the diagrams.below. Please note that this depiction shows the DHCP server located on a different network segment than the new client. But it's not required to be that way.


==== Example ====
'''''Figure 1'''''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DHCP1.jpg]]

In figure 1, a new client that just joined the network, needs an IP address. Since it does not know the DHCP server's location, the client broadcasts (step 1) a DHCPDISCOVER message on the local network. The message packet contains a hardware identifier (usually the MAC address), the source port (68), the destination IP (255.255.255.255), destination port (67), and a randomly generated transaction id. Optionally the client can specify the IP address it wants and the lease duration in the message. Once the DHCP relay receives the broadcasted message, it fills in the &quot;giaddr&quot; field of the packet with the gateway IP address of 10.1.2.9 . This piece of information is critical because the DHCP Server needs it to determine which subnet the client is on and thus which IP address to allocate to the client. Afterwards the DHCPDISCOVER message is relayed to the DHCP Server via unicast (step 2). A unicast, instead of a broadcast, is sufficient because the DHCP relay knows the exact location of the DHCP server. For this same reason, the DHCP relay does not allow the other network segment, 10.1.1.X, to receive the message.

Once the DHCP server receives the DHCPDISCOVER request, it allocates an IP address, marks it as taken, and then broadcasts a DHCPOFFER message back to the requesting client. This message packet contains the DHCP server's IP address, the client's hardware identifier, the same transaction id, and the IP address allocated for the client. Optionally, the message may also contain the lease time, subnet mask, default TTL, default router(s), and numerous other parameters.

'''''Figure 2'''''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DHCP2.jpg]]

In figure 2, the DHCP server allocates new IP address 10.1.2.3 for the client and broadcasts a DHCPOFFER message to its network (step 3). When the DHCP relay sees the DHCPOFFER broadcast, it relays the broadcast to the 10.1.2.X network and only that network (step 4). Once the new client sees the DHCPOFFER message, it accepts the IP address (step 5) and prepares a confirmation message to the DHCP
server with a DHCPREQUEST packet. Please note that the client does not have to accept this IP address, in which case it will not send a DHCPREQUEST message. If multiple DHCP servers sends out a DHCPOFFER, the client can choose which one to accept. If for some reason, the DHCPOFFER message fails to ever arrive, the client will rebroadcast the DHCPDISCOVER message.

'''''Figure 3'''''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DHCP3.jpg]]

If the client included optional information in the initial DHCPDISCOVER message, it must include that same information in the subsequent DHCPREQUEST message. In step 6 of figure 3, the new client confirms it wants the IP address 10.1.2.3 by broadcasting a DHCPREQUEST to the DHCP server. Once the DHCP Server receives this message (with help again from the DHCP Relay), it first ensures that it is the intended target - because  the client could be responding to another DHCP Server. If this DHCP server is not the intended target, then it knows some other DHCP server is handling this client. So this DHCP server can discard any previously allocated IP address for that client. If this DHCP Server is the intended recipient, then it has to verify the optional parameters that it specified in the previous DHCPOFFER message to this client, are still valid. Assuming everything is fine up to this point, the DHCP Server sends a DHCPACK broadcast (step 8) to tell the client that its new IP address can now officially be used. However, if something is wrong, then a DHCPNACK is broadcasted instead. Either way, a DHCPACK or DHCPNACK will be the final message sent by the DHCP server in the dynamic IP address allocation sequence..

Assuming it receives the DHCPACK relayed by the router (step 9), the client is encouraged to verify no other hosts has the same IP address. This is usually accomplished through a simple ARP probe. Any response to the probe means that another client is already using the IP address. In such a situation, the client must send a DHCPDECLINE message to the DHCP server. Afterwards the client will then need to restart this whole process beginning with DHCPDISCOVER phase. In most cases, there's no response to the client's ARP probe. This means the client can go ahead and use the allocated IP address along with any other optional information stored in the message packet.

If the client got a DHCPNAK instead of DHCPACK, then it has no choice but to restart everything from the very beginning i.e. the DHCPDISCOVER stage. Finally, if the client doesn't receive any DHCPACK or DHCPNAK message after a certain period of time, then it rebroadcasts the DHCPREQUEST message.

==== Other DHCP Messages ====
   IP Renewal:  If the client wishes to renew its existing IP address (usually because of expiring lease), it unicasts a special  
                DHCPREQUEST message that indicates it's renewing (and not asking for new) IP address. The DHCP server can choose 
                to extend the lease or reject it. Either way, it must inform the client via a DHCPACK message.

   Release IP:  The client can request its current IP address be relinquished by issuing a DHCPRELEASE message (via unicast) to          
                the DHCP server. The message packet must contain the IP address and the hardware identifier of the client. Upon 
                receipt, the DHCP server marks the client's IP address as unallocated.

   Inform:      The client already has an IP address but needs additional configuration parameters, such as default TTL, subnet 
                mask, etc. So it sends a DHCPINFORM message to the DHCP server. In response, the DHCP server unicasts a DHCPACK


==== Security Concerns ====
DHCP is inherently insecure because there's no authentication mechanism built in. Here are a few examples of security weaknesses.

   Problem:  The DHCP server does not know if requests are from a legitimate new client or a rogue host pretending to be one.
   Impact:   This could lead to IP addresses allocated to spoofed MAC addresses that don't exist, and eventually exhaust the pool  
             of legitimate IP addresses. Thus new hosts cannot added to the network.
   Solution: Manually assign IP addresses or manually verify every new client requesting IP address. Can also audit the DHCP 
             database. But these are all fairly time-consuming. No simple way to address this issue.

   Problem:  A new client doesn't know if responses are coming from real DHCP server or rogue host pretending to be a DHCP server.
   Impact:   If the client accepts all the information given to it by the rogue DHCP server, then false information (e.g. bad 
             subnet mask) could render the client useless.
   Solution: Can identify fake DHCP servers by using security tools that send out DHCPDISCOVER &amp; DHCPREQUEST messages and flag any
             suspicious information returned.


== Summary ==
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a convenient, though insecure, technique to assign an IP address to a host newly added to a network. It can also be used to extend the lease period of an existing IP address, drop the IP address of a host, or provide initial configuration parameters to a requesting host.

== Exercises ==
Question:
# Using the example illustrated in the DHCP section, explain how the interaction between the new client and the DHCP Server would change if the DHCP Server is located on the same network segment as the new client.
# (T/F) Once a new client receives the IP address after the DHCPOFFER, the client should verify no other hosts are using that IP address.

Answer:
# The only difference would be the DHCP Relay not getting involved. Thus the DHCP Server receives broadcasts instead of unicasts, and the &quot;igaddr&quot; field of the message packet wil be empty.
# False - the client must wait until DHCPACK (not DHCPOFFER) because the IP address is not officially assigned to the new client until DHCPACK is received.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Network Address Translation ==

When IP addresses were introduced, only a portion of the theoretical four billion or so IP addresses were available for assignment. Early on, this was not a problem because the Internet was only used among groups of academic researchers, a few high tech companies, and the U.S. Government. But after the Internet exploded in popularity during the mid-1990s, it soon became clear that there won't be enough IP addresses to keep up with demand. In response, IPv6 was proposed as a long term solution. But IPv6 was quite different from IPv4 and had complexities that slowed down its adoption. So a practical short term solution was needed, and thereby Network Address Translation (NAT) was introduced.

=== Example ===
The basic idea behind NAT is to assign a single IP address to a NAT device. We'll call this the public IP address. Within the local network behind the NAT device, every computing device gets assigned a private IP address as illustrated below:

'''''Figure 1'''''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Network Address Translation (file1).jpg]]

In figure 1, the NAT device's public IP address is 145.12.131.7 while the private IP addresses are in the range 192.168.X.X. This range of private IP addresses is one of three common ranges:

   Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255/8
   Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255/12
   Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255/16

Keep in mind that private IP addresses are valid only within that local area network. It is not recognized on the public Internet. For packets that originate from a private IP address and port, it must be converted to a unique public IP address and port before it can be sent to the Internet. The mapping from private IP address &amp; port to a public IP address &amp; port is typically done through a translation table inside the NAT device. An example is shown in figure 2:

'''''Figure 2'''''
[[Image:Network Address Translation (file2).jpg]]

In step 1, the host at private IP address 192.168.100.3 is requesting the homepage of www.yahoo.com via an HTTP request through port 3855. When the HTTP packet arrives at the NAT device (step 2), it looks up the translation table for an existing public (IP addr, port) entry for this private (IP addr, port) combination. If no existing entry exists, then the NAT device will create a new public (IP addr, port) entry. If there is an existing entry, then the translation process will use the existing entry. Please remember that each entry in the translation table must always remain unique! After the table lookup is complete, the IP packet is then altered so that the new IP address and port replaces the old one. Finally in step 3, the altered packet is routed to www.yahoo.com . This entire network address translation process is completely transparent to the end hosts. In other words, neither the host at 192.168.100.3 nor the Yahoo web server realizes the packet has been changed.

The packet from Yahoo's web server now goes through the reverse translation process to reach the requesting host.

'''''Figure 3'''''
[[Image:NAT3.jpg]]

The reverse process is similar to the original translation process. It will look up the translation table for the corresponding private (IP addr, port) pair when given the public (IP addr, port) pair. The only difference it that a missing entry will result in the packet getting thrown away. Once the lookup and alteration is completed (step 5), the packet (now contains the original private (IP addr, port) information) is sent to the requesting host at 192.168.100.3 port 3855.

===NAT vs. Proxy===
NATs are sometimes confused with proxies, but they are actually quite different in one aspect: transparency. NAT is completely transparent to the end hosts i.e. only the NAT device knows that an IP conversion is taking place. But for proxies, the source application/host is well aware of the change because it has to deliberately be configured to use the proxy.

===Problems with NAT===
Applications that holds their [private] IP address information inside data packets will find that it doesn't match with their actual IP address once the IP translation is done and the packet is on the Internet. Example: FTP

Among the chief complaints is that the widespread use of NAT has resulted in delayed deployment of IPv6, which is the more ideal long-term solution. Despite all the issues associated with NAT, it is still &quot;good enough&quot; for most home users. Therefore, adoption of IPv6 among DSL and cable Internet customers in the U.S. will continue to be slow. For Internet purists, the whole NAT solution is considered to be a quick &quot;hack&quot; rather than a long term solution. The original Internet was designed for end-to-end communication, where every host has a public IP address.

===Overcoming NAT Restrictions===
Simple Traversal of UDP through NAT (STUN) : Suppose Host A and Host B are both behind asymmetric NATs and both have a UDP session with server S who is directly connected to the Internet. Then host A can use the same source IP &amp; port as the existing connection with S to initiate session with host B. Meanwhile, S knows the public IP and port of A's session with B since it's the same as A's session with S. S then passes this info to B, and B initiates UDP session with A.

Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN): this setup requires an intermediary server S, who is directly connected to Internet. Both hosts A and B would have to initiate session with S, and then S will relay their messages to each other.

==Port Address Translation==
A related but somewhat different concept to NAT is port address translation (PAT). PAT allows incoming sessions, that are initiated from an external host, to map to a specific internal host and port. For example, in figure 4

'''''Figure 4'''''
[[Image:PAT.jpg]]

all incoming requests to port 80 of the router are forwarded to internal host 192.168.100.2 port 7575. Likewise, all incoming connections to port 22 or the router are redirected to host 192.168.100.1 port 22. This type of setup is common for users to wish to run a server behind a NAT device. The only down side to PAT is that it's restricted to one entry per router port.

== Summary ==
Network Address Translation (NAT) is a widely-used solution to the shortage of IP addresses. NAT introduces the concept of a &quot;private&quot; IP address that is valid only within a Local Area Network (LAN) and must be translated to the &quot;public&quot; IP address that's used on the Internet. With NAT, we can have multiple private IP addresses share a single public IP address, thus delaying the need to deploy long-term solutions to the shortage of IP addresses.

== Exercises ==
Question:
# STUN and TURN were presented as 2 ways to bypass NATs. Can you describe 2 additional methods for bypassing NAT?
# (T/F) Both STUN and TURN can only be used for UDP and never for TCP.

Answer:
# Universal Plug and Play (mkiUPnP), assuming the router or NAT device is configured to accept it. Another method is to tunnel out to a server. Yet a third method is to use Application Layer Gateways, assuming the router or NAT device has it built in.
# False - STUN is only for UDP, but TURN applies to both UDP and TCP.

==Introduction==

====Significance====

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space Office Space] is a comedy movie released in 1999. It was written and directed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Judge Mike Judge], the creator of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Hill King of the Hill] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beavis_and_Butt-head Beavis and Butt-head]. The movie was promoted using the tagline “Work Sucks.&quot; The tagline is indicative of the attitudes towards work that Office Space characters hold. The movie was intended as a satire of life in a typical software company, but has been interpreted as a satire of white collar office life in general. It grossed more than $10 million in North America &lt;ref&gt;Box Office Mojo (2012). ''Office Space''. Retrieved from http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=officespace.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;, but it was even more successful in after-theatre sales &lt;ref&gt;CNN (2003). ''Film flops flourish on DVD, VHS''. Retrieved from http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/04/second.wind/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;. Office Space has a substantial cult following. It has sold 6 million copies on VHS and DVD &lt;ref&gt;The Numbers (2012). ''Office Space''. Retrieved from http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1999/OFFIC.php.&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Plot====

Peter Gibbons, the main character, is a programmer at Initech, a software company. Peter hates his job. The only coworkers that he can tolerate are his friends Michael and Samir, who also hate their jobs. In particular, Peter hates his boss, Bill Lumbergh, who nitpicks and micromanages him. Bill hires two consultants, Bob and Bob, to assist Initech in evaluating employees and conducting layoffs. The layoffs create a high stress environment in the office, as the employees have to interview for their own jobs.

Peter’s life is changed once he visits a hypnotherapist, who hypnotizes him, putting him in a state of ecstasy. The hypnotherapist dies immediately after hypnotizing Peter. Stuck in his state of ecstasy, Peter does not concern himself with things he doesn’t like doing, like going to work. He shows up sporadically, comes in late, guts a fish on his desk, and knocks down one of the walls of his cubicle. Ironically, Peter’s laid back demeanor strikes the consultants positively and he’s offered a promotion. At the same time, however, he discovers that his friends Michael and Samir will be fired.

After he tells them, the three decide to steal from Initech by planting a virus in its accounting system. They think the theft will be so small that it won’t be noticed. However, they make a mistake and unintentionally steal much more money than they intended. Peter, Samir and Michael are nervous about being caught and sentenced to prison. Peter decides to leave a check for the stolen amount at Initech along with a note taking responsibility for the theft. The next morning, Peter finds the Initech office in flames. The check, along with all the evidence, is destroyed.

==Professionalism Themes==

====Autonomy====

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy Autonomy], or lack thereof, is a strong unifying theme in ''Office Space''. An Initech memo stated that employees should use a specific cover-sheet on their reports. After forgetting to include the cover-sheet on his report, Peter apologizes for his mistake to his managers. They repeatedly ask whether he received a copy of the memo, even while Peter is holding a copy of the memo in plain sight. The managers do not trust Peter to perform even the simplest of tasks. He is not empowered to think for himself. Simply, he has no autonomy. An exchange between Peter and the consultants illustrates this.

Peter Gibbons: The thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care.&lt;br /&gt;
Bob Porter: Don't... don't care?&lt;br /&gt;
Peter Gibbons: …And here's something else, Bob: I have eight different bosses right now. &lt;br /&gt;
Bob Slydell: I beg your pardon?&lt;br /&gt;
Peter Gibbons: Eight bosses.&lt;br /&gt;
Bob Slydell: Eight?&lt;br /&gt;
Peter Gibbons: Eight, Bob. So that means that when I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it. That's my only real motivation is not to be hassled, that and the fear of losing my job. But you know, Bob, that will only make someone work just hard enough not to get fired.&lt;br /&gt;

This behavior is emblematic of management's treatment of employees in this movie. Every major character suffers from the same lack of autonomy. One of the cornerstones of professionalism is the freedom to exercise discretion and judgment - a freedom these employees lacked.

====Duty====
Peter, Michael, and Samir are also brought together by their lack of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty duty] to Initech. As employees, one would consider it their duty to work in the best interests of the company in all of their actions at work. Peter's description of a typical workday is telling of his opinion of his duty towards the company: &quot;Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late. I use the side door, that way Lumbergh can't see me. Uh, and after that, I just sorta space out for about an hour ... I just stare at my desk but it looks like I'm working. I do that for probably another hour after lunch too. I'd probably, say, in a given week, I probably do about fifteen minutes of real, actual work.&quot; At one point in the movie, Lumbergh hangs up a sign that says “Is this good for the company?” indicating that employees should strive to observe their duty to the firm. Later, Peter tears down the sign, an outward sign of how little he cares about Initech. This lack of duty contributes to Peter’s unprofessional actions – theft – later in the film.

====Arete====
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete Arete] is the concept of excellence in a pursuit that is challenging and fulfilling. Describing his work at Initech, Peter says, &quot;I sit in a cubicle and I update software for the two thousand switch... it doesn't really matter. I don't like my job, and I don't think I'm going to go anymore.&quot; This statement shows that he has no arete there. The key part of this statement is when he says &quot;it doesn't really matter.&quot; Clearly, he has no sense of excellence in his job. This lack of arete that leads him to feel a crushing sense of despair early in the film.

Later in the film, Peter gets a job as a construction worker. This is a job that he may have initially looked down on, but finds fulfilling. When his former coworkers offer him a job at their new firm, he responds that he’s “definitely sure” he doesn’t want a job. The last shot of him in the movie is a wide pan, showing him surveying the workplace with a broad smile on his face: the smile of someone who has achieved happiness through excellence.

==Analogous Cases==

====Galileo Galilei====

[[File:Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636.jpg|right|frame|x150px|Galileo Galilei was a famous astronomer and physicist]]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei Galileo Galilei] was an Italian astronomer and physicist most noted for his support for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism heliocentricism]. During his time, heliocentricism was a dangerous view to hold - the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church Catholic Church] described Galileo's views as &quot;altogether contrary to Holy Scripture.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Decree of the Index. ''Galileo Trial Documents''. Retrieved from http://www1.umn.edu/ships/galileo/library/1616docs.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church's tasked a special team, known as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Inquisition Roman Inquisition], to prosecute and try those suspected of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy heresy] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy blasphemy]. The Inquisition levied various punishments up to the death penalty. Knowing that his writings and teachings could catch the Inquisition's eye, Galileo still continued to write about his observations regarding the solar system. Even later warnings from the Church did not dissuade Galileo from pursuing his steadfast duty to science.

Eventually, the Inquisition put Galileo on trial for his &quot;crimes&quot; and he spent the rest of his life in house arrest&lt;ref&gt;Weidhorn, Manfred (2005). The Person of the Millennium: The Unique Impact of Galileo on World History. ISBN 0-595-36877-8&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite his house arrest, Galileo continued his research and supported the cause of truth and heliocentricism. Although the Church took his physical autonomy, Galileo still retained his professional autonomy and freedom to pursue science. It is clear that Galileo had both autonomy and duty. History proves his arete or excellence since he is titled &quot;The Father of Modern Science&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro, Maurice A. (Fall 2007). &quot;Book Review—The Person of the Millennium: The Unique Impact of Galileo on World History&quot;. The Historian 69 (3) doi:10.1111/j.1540-6563.2007.00189_68.x.&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;The Father of Modern Physics&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Weidhorn, Manfred (2005). The Person of the Millennium: The Unique Impact of Galileo on World History. ISBN 0-595-36877-8 &lt;/ref&gt; because of his exceptional contributions to the fields of astronomy, physics and mathematics.

====Lucius Cincinnatus====



Lucius [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnatus Cincinnatus] was a famous Roman politician from roughly 2500 years ago &lt;ref&gt; Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus. (2012). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/117993/Lucius-Quinctius-Cincinnatus&lt;/ref&gt;. Although his story is somewhat apocryphal – it comes from one ancient Roman historian, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livy Livy] – it contains highly relevant lessons. Cincinnatus was an important Roman politician, but a scandal brought him down and saw him exiled to a small farm outside of Rome. However, a few years later, Rome was threatened by an invading army, and the Roman government appointed him to a dictatorial position to repel the invaders. In fifteen days, Cincinnatus raised an army and personally led it to victory. On the sixteenth day, he resigned his position as dictator and went back to his farm &lt;ref&gt;Lucius Q Cincinnatus. (2012). The Cincinnatus Association. Retrieved from http://www.cincinnatusassoc.org/pages/Lucius-Q-Cincinnatus.html&lt;/ref&gt;. His arête and autonomy are both clear here: ability to turn a losing war into a winning war in fifteen days demonstrates that leadership is his area of excellence. And as an appointed dictator, he clearly had an excess of autonomy. But the most compelling aspect of Cincinnatus’s story was his sense of duty to the Roman people. Although he had been exiled, he did not hesitate to come to Rome’s aid when called upon. And after achieving victory, he could have remained as dictator, but his sense of duty to the Roman people and the Roman republic had him resign his power and return to his farm. This duty – a commitment to the people he served, over his own interests – made him a true professional, and a successful one.

====Robert McNamara====

[[File:Robert McNamara official portrait.jpg|right|frame|x150px|Robert McNamara was the 8th United States Secretary of Defense]]

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara Robert McNamara] is best known for his service as the Secretary of Defense under Presidents [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy John F. Kennedy] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson Lyndon B. Johnson]. He had been the President of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company Ford Motor Company] for less than five weeks when he received the call from the newly elected President Kennedy to serve as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense Secretary of Defense] &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense (2012). ''Robert S. McNamara''. Retrieved from http://www.defense.gov/specials/secdef_histories/bios/mcnamara.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The role of autonomy in McNamara’s career is very prevalent. McNamara was given extensive autonomy by President Kennedy during the early years of the Vietnam War. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Sorensen Ted Sorensen], one of Kennedy’s advisors, wrote that Kennedy regarded McNamara as the &quot;star of his team, calling upon him for advice on a wide range of issues beyond national security, including business and economic matters.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;John Shattuck (2012). ''An Evening with Ted Sorensen''. &lt;/ref&gt; However, McNamara’s autonomy was significantly restricted under Johnson. McNamara's recommendation to freeze troop levels and stop bombing North Vietnam was rejected by Johnson &lt;ref&gt;National Exhibition (2010). ''Biography of Robert McNamara''. Retrieved from http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/explore/biography.cfm?name=McNamara,%20Robert.&lt;/ref&gt;. Rather than accept his limited autonomy and ability to carry out his professional duties, McNamara resigned in 1968. In this way, McNamara demonstrated uncompromised professional conviction.

==Conclusion==
&lt;!--Do not remove templates below this line --&gt;
There is a great deal to be learned about office ethics from ''Office Space''. In particular, the movie illustrates the concepts of autonomy, duty, and arete through the main character, Peter. While these components are not a comprehensive characterization of a professional, they are necessary components. These concepts have been integral in the conduct of professionals throughout history, as exemplified by Galileo Galilei, Lucius Cincinnatus, and Robert McNamara.

== &lt;u&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

Knowledge management (KM) is essential in helping employees work efficiently and effectively. Groff and Jones (2003) portray KM as a tool, technology and strategy to analyze, organize and improve organization operation which helps developing new knowledge and creating the competitive advantage. KM can be used to harvest human asset in individuals’ mind. By using KM, librarians can serve user in a user-friendly way. A university library in Asia (Library A) realized this and started to develop KM in ten years ago. They have used different tools such as intranet and wiki to implement KM.

In the following, we will use 4 stages in KM cycle to analyze and evaluate KM application in Library A. They are knowledge capture, creation, sharing and lastly application and reuse.
 
==== '''Definition of Knowledge Capture''' ====

As suggested by Becerra-Fernandez, Gonzalez and Sabherwal (2004, p. 32-36 as cited in SAĞSAN, 2006), “knowledge capture which may be defined as the process of retrieving either explicit or tacit knowledge that resides within people, artifacts or organizational entities”.
 
==== '''Definition of Knowledge Creation''' ====

The Next step is knowledge creation. According to Dalkir (2005), Nonaka and Takeuchi Model states that knowledge creation is to transform tacit and explicit knowledge into different forms. It consists of Socialization (tacit to tacit), Externalization (tacit to explicit), Combination (explicit to explicit), and Internalization (explicit to tacit).
 
==== '''Definition of Knowledge Sharing''' ====

As suggested by Becerra-Fernandez, Gonzalez and Sabherwal (2004, p. 32-36 as cited in SAĞSAN, 2006), knowledge sharing is the stage which “Tacit or explicit knowledge is communicated to other organizational participants.”

==== '''Definition of Application and Re-use''' ====

The final step is knowledge application and reuse. Dhiman and Sharma (2009) state that this stage is to use the knowledge created or acquired before to further organize, publish, distribute and reuse whenever it is useful.


== &lt;u&gt;'''Literature Review'''&lt;/u&gt; ==


==== '''Background''' ====

In this information and knowledge age, knowledge has become a valuable asset (Maponya, 2004). In the last ten years, many academic industries, particularly university library, started to apply knowledge management in their daily operations and consider it as a serious issue in the organization. Wen (2005) reports that The International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) 69th General Conference and Council (Berlin, Germany; August 2003) opened a session on KM, while the 3rd China-US Library Conference (Shanghai, China; March 22-25, 2005) addressed KM as a sub-theme of the conference. 

==== '''Knowledge Capture''' ====

Library uses formal and informal ways in capturing knowledge. Lim (1992), Dhiman and Sharma (2009) indicate some KM tools to capture knowledge at the Victorian Universities in Australia and The National Library Board. They use printed material such as newsletters and agendas of meetings. There is also an increased use of communication technologies to capture knowledge such as fax, teleconferencing, videoconferencing, and E-mail. Lim (1992) claims an informal way like cross-campus visits is organized at the Victorian Universities’ libraries which can ensure staff can be kept informed and in-the-know about their job. Besides, electronic systems are also set up to capture knowledge. Dhiman and Sharma (2009) take The National Library Board (NLB) in Singapore as an example. Database InfoXpress is established for recording customers’ questions while the Project Broadcast database was implemented to record the staff contributions and accomplishments. Besides, Gibson (2010) suggests to develop data cleaning in order to enable library records generated by library users navigation to be mined.

==== '''Knowledge Creation''' ====

After capturing the facts, information and data, the next step is creating the new skills, ideas as to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of library.  Dhiman and Sharma (2009) indicates knowledge creation is an essential process for the future development of the organization to ensure better operation. Some libraries have built a learning atmosphere to encourage employees create new knowledge. Dhiman and Sharma cites that some libraries create knowledge competition to let employee contribute to the KM. The university libraries in the U.S. emphasizes on the knowledge creation in innovation since it help the library to keep pace with the dynamic environment. Most of the top managers agree that their staff need continue to capture knowledge to create new knowledge to achieve greater effectiveness.
 
==== '''Knowledge Sharing''' ====
 

After gaining organized knowledge in order to improve the daily operational process, librarian can utilize know-how through knowledge sharing. Librarian training is one of the strategies in knowledge sharing. Among different types of training, Clark (1986) claims that one to one instruction mode of teaching is the best and the most common one in Library bibliographic instruction training. However, only several libraries use one to one assistant or mentor systems in training. In another case, Semertzaki (2011) states the redesigned intranet “iSeek” in the United Nations (UN) fosters a sense of community and encourages dialogue among employee and top management worldwide. Furthermore, Lim (1992) claims some the sharing ways like social gatherings and interchange of staff to establish good communication between staffs.
 
The knowledge sharing practice not only takes place within an organization. Maponya (2004) points out that libraries need to cooperate with each other to handle or address the problems encountered and acquire knowledge. Lim (1992) even identifies a cooperation system - administrative centralization that is used in the libraries in Victorian universities in Australia to share knowledge within organization.

==== '''Knowledge Application and Re-use''' ====

Gibson (2010) reports that data mining technology should be used by territory school’s library to implement KM in library operation in order to improve the effectiveness  and efficiency. This method allows library staff to read the record and generate knowledge.

==== '''Problems of applying KM in library''' ====

The low willingness of staff to share their knowledge and high difficulties in managing tacit knowledge are two general problems when applying KM in library. Mapanya (2004) and Trivedi (2007) identify these two problems in University of Natal Pietermaritzburg Libraries and Department of Health in UK. Staff usually does not aware of the importance of KM and ignores the KM policies or strategies in libraries. Besides, it is difficult to capture and share tacit knowledge of all internal staff, for example, no written KM policy and strategy is written in University of Natal Pietermaritzburg Libraries. Beside these two problems, Wen (2005) discovers that most knowledge is context specific, which means useful in particular situations. Trivedi (2007) also points out a similar problem that old knowledge is not useful in current and future times. Therefore, knowledge in a centralized knowledge management system would be relevant to users of certain unit but irrelevant to most users.
 
==== '''Future Development''' ====

In the 21st century, many written resources would be digitized such as e-mail, e-newspaper, online shop and even e-books. It is inevitable to use technology for the future development of KM in academic library. Burke(2004) and Trivedi (2007) predict that using automated systems would be the trend for all libraries in the world. As a result, libraries need more technical staff that is familiar with high technology. They need to understand the information and knowledge needs of users and should be responsible for mapping the external and internal knowledge for enhancing working efficiency.

Besides, the information landscape would be reshaped in the 21st century. Lee (2007) points out that many libraries provide coffee shops, computer labs and Web 2.0 technologies as complement of their service. It provides an instant gratification and choice for the users. Those libraries can build a more relaxed atmosphere to encourage people to exchange knowledge in libraries.


== &lt;u&gt;'''Methodology'''&lt;/u&gt; ==
 
The objective of this research is to find out a series of KM application in the Library A.

Before going into deep investigation of the applications of KM in Library A, 21 pieces of works have been read, including books, articles, e-journals and thesis, in order to understand the applications of KM in other universities and libraries. Based on the literature reviews, this academic research focuses on two main aspects: how the University of Asia apply KM in the daily operation of libraries. And how the University of Asia can improve the daily operation by using KM. 

In order to find out a series of most suitable application of KM in Library A, the current knowledge management applications have been investigated and an interview has been conducted with the Knowledge Management Coordinator.

The KM Coordinator is also titled Information Literacy &amp; Knowledge Management Librarian. She is responsible for monitoring the organization of library instruction programmes, such as the application of knowledge management, foundations to information technology and credit-earning course for undergraduates, in Library A.

In an hour face-to-face interview with the KM coordinator,  . In order to facilitate the flow of the interview, note-taking is allowed during the interview.



== &lt;u&gt;'''Analysis of Result'''&lt;/u&gt; ==


==== '''Knowledge Capture''' ==== 

The Knowledge Management Coordinator in Library A states that there is a significant project, Scholar Hub, running in the library. Before this project implemented, a lot of essays written by different scholars in university cannot be searched by users systematically. The Scholar Hub allows users to search and gain specialised knowledge from professionals. It collects the knowledge from university  effectively.  By referencing to the knowledge base in The National Library Board mentioned  by Dhiman and Sharma (2009), using database to capture knowledge effectively seems to be a major trend in library industry.

On the other hand, the library committee is formed by representatives from every faculty, subject librarians, and knowledge team. They receive the opinions from faculties. The subject librarians understand the needs of faculties and different subjects. After that, they make policy and IT improvements for the library. These activities are kinds of interviews with subject matter experts in different fields. The tacit knowledge can be gathered for the community. We found that it is quite similar to other libraries like The National Library Board which capture the tacit knowledge by meetings and discussion. (Dhiman &amp; Sharma 2009)

When employees quit their jobs, they need to prepare a handover notes in order to pass the specific knowledge acquired to newcomers. The library also hires professionals to train their staffs. Both explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge are available to be transferred to the staffs in the library.

Another way in capturing tacit knowledge is attending international forum by staff. They will share their experience and knowledge acquired from the forum by creating notes, providing presentations to other staff in the library. All staff can learn the knowledge acquired from other libraries. In this way, the library can improve their working process.

Library A also captures tacit knowledge from public. In the library website, the public can make enquiries or express their opinion through text, telephone, email, social media etc. The librarians and staff can review the records when they encounter the same situation or enquiry from customers afterwards. Dhiman and Sharma (2009) reflects that a database should be implemented to record customers knowledge and experience. It would be better to store knowledge in a database. 

==== '''Knowledge Creation''' ==== 

Library A lacks a great effort on creating knowledge within the library. By comparing to other libraries, Library A only provides some training courses to teach staff how to use the libraries’ database. However, other libraries have developed knowledge construction such as a good culture to increase the incentive of staff to create new ideas in order to improve organizational processes and competencies(Dhiman &amp; Sharma, 2009). Although the staff of Library A has attended many site visits, it just acquires knowledge but not build on its own knowledge. It is good to absorb others advantage and then apply in the organization. However, it is bad to ‘copy’ others ideas without new knowledge. Library A would be lag behind others and fail to renew all their capabilities.

==== '''Knowledge Sharing''' ====

Eden (2002) suggests that people can visit other successful library for knowledge sharing. Library A sends representatives to visit other libraries in the city nearby to learn from them. Librarians share their professional knowledge and experience to each other during the library visit. Furthermore, Library A is a member of Joint University Library Advisory Committee. Expertise knowledge in library management is shared in the meetings so the staff can learn the practices of other libraries.
 
Semertzaki (2011) states that the redesigned intranet “iSeek” in the United Nations (UN) fosters a sense of community and encourages dialogue among employee and top management worldwide. In Library A, different types of knowledge are shared through the intranet, which is only accessible by full-time staff. Written materials such as discussion minutes, conference records, reports of specific projects are posted in the intranet. Besides, the quality sharing team posts their minutes in the intranet to let each departments in the library to learn and improve. Some departments also post basic procedures and regulations of work for the staff. However, it does not utilize the intranet system. Staff does not share their knowledge and gives their opinions to the information posted. So knowledge cannot be shared in a fast pace within the library.
 
As reported by Dhiman and Sharma (2009), regular meetings and formal briefings are commonly used in The National Library Board to ensure the staff is on the right track of their work. Every department in Library A has their regular meetings and formal briefings, knowledge about work is shared within the department in these activities, which is an effective way that knowledge can be shared regularly and in a formal manner.
 
Lim (1992) points out that some other methods such as social gatherings or interchange of staff are used to enhance knowledge sharing at the Victorian Universities in Australia. Staff Relationship Committee (SRC) also organizes social activities such as barbecue and hiking for different departments. The staff does not consider the social activities as a means to share their knowledge, but an opportunity of improving the relationship of the staff only. This wastes a treasurable opportunity of knowledge sharing between the staff of different departments since they have little chance to work together and share their knowledge to the others.

==== '''Knowledge Application &amp; Re-use''' ==== 

Re-use is the final process that users selectively seek out the knowledge which can apply and re-use the retrieved knowledge according to their needs. 

Although all the comments and complaints of the library are stored in the website of the Library A, Anna said that there is no knowledge base for staffs to handle the complaints. As the complaints are diverse over topic, the response and answer is not reusable and cannot be standardized. Therefore, according to Anna, there is no need to establish a knowledge base to handle the complaints even though Gibson(2010) reported that implementing data mining in libraries would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its daily operation.



== &lt;u&gt;'''Recommendations'''&lt;/u&gt; ==


Establish a knowledge base recording past experience and best practices
In Library A, enquiries, complaints and suggestions from customers are collected on the library’s website. However, the replies to the enquiries and customers’ opinions as well as the best practice of work are not recorded. The experience from employees and best practice as templates are useful for future use and to raise staff performance. 
Dhiman &amp; Sharma (2009) reports that National Library Board implemented the Project Broadcast database to record staff contributions and accomplishments. Library A is encouraged to establish similar knowledge base to record customers’ opinions and staffs’ accomplishments . In this way, other staffs especially new comers can refer to previous cases when they face similar matters.

==== '''Training for using new technology''' ====

There are immense amount of literature in the searching database in Library A. However, employees cannot effectively use the knowledge management tools, for instance, the database searching in library. They only understand the basic functionality of the systems.
Koenig (2004) states that librarians cannot perform effective database mining without training. In Library A, it is not compulsory for the staff to attend training courses for the new technology applied in the library. However, it is necessary for employee to be familiar with the data mining skill to enhance information seeking. Staff should be encouraged to participate in related training activities when new technology is implemented into the library.

==== '''Establish electronic communication forum''' ====

Library A does not have any electronic communication forums for the staff. Electronic communication forums can be used as a platform for organizing community of practice among employees. 
Kuhlen (2004) states that electronic forums can allow exchange of information between employees with different backgrounds who will not have any collaborations in real life. It will also build a continuous knowledge bases which is available for employees. It is suggested to establish a electronic forum as a platform for the staff from different departments to share their knowledge and discuss current issues about the library. Knowledge can be shared among the staff of different departments without complicated procedures.

==== '''Build up knowledge sharing culture''' ====

A library in the same city of Library A has already built the common learning place to develop its sharing culture. However, most of the staff in Library A do not know the importance of knowledge sharing and has low willingness and incentive to share their knowledge. Gurteen (1999) suggests that rewarding knowledge sharing and motivating knowledge sharing helps create knowledge sharing culture in an organization. Financial reward can be an incentive for knowledge sharing. Staffs who are active in knowledge sharing can be given reward to encourage his behavior. In addition, Library A can let the staffs learn the benefits of knowledge sharing to themselves since knowledge sharing helps the staffs do their jobs more effectively, helps them in their personal development and career progression and brings more personal recognition. With the financial incentive and benefits of knowledge sharing, staffs are encouraged to be more active in knowledge sharing in the library.

==== '''Build a knowledge creating culture''' ====

The staffs of Library A lack incentive to create new knowledge. They always accept the order from the manager and solve problem with same solution. They do not think of new methods to increase the effectiveness of operation. Therefore, the managers should cultivate staff to have the idea of creating new knowledge. They can provide some creativity course and talk to initiate their interesting. Besides, managers must be opened to accept staffs’ opinion in order to let them feel free to create new idea without unfriendly criticism. 


== &lt;u&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/u&gt; ==



Applying KM from ten years ago, Library A is still at the starting stage to have well-rounded KM. Considering the three critical elements of successful KM, technology, process and people, Library A still has space for improvement. Regarding “technology”, Library A has developed intranet and wiki for information provision and sharing, but the systems are not widely used by the staff for knowledge sharing. Also, knowledge base is not developed to record good staff practices as reference of the staffs’ daily work. Concerning “process”, many practices in the library enhance knowledge capture in the library, but little efforts are put on other processes including knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application and re-use. With regard to “people”, staffs in library A still have low awareness about KM. Most of the staff do not know the importance of knowledge sharing in the library and not much knowledge of the staff are applied and used at their work. Once the problems related to the three key elements of KM are solved with corresponding measures, the application of KM in Library A will be more smooth and successful.

Please post your comments here.

Wong Nga Shun: It is better to include the definitions of Knowledge Capture, Creation, Sharing and Application under the section of Literature Review rather than Introduction part.

Lau Hei Tung Herbert: The concepts of knowledge management are well defined but it should be organized more effectively. It is because the literature Review has the details of those concepts.

What is electronic communication forum? Does the unit really need this forum since it has an intranet already --[[User:Au Sze Wah|Au Sze Wah]] ([[User talk:Au Sze Wah|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Au Sze Wah|contribs]]) 11:57, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

Chiu Pui Lai: You may further explain why Knowledge Creation is not active in Library A as Library A has implemented KM for 10 years and there 're a number of sharing opportunites provided. There're must some reasons behind that you can focus on and elaborate more, it may be related to the sharing culture or KM strategies etc.

Yuen Tung Ki: some of the Literature Review seem to be personal opinion. Overall, the recommendation part is good with LR support.


Kwok Pak Lun: The definition of KM activities (e.g. Knowledge Creation, Knowledge Capture) are well defined. For easy understand, the recommendation is preferred to structure based on the analysis.

The purpose of this research is to analyze how KM is implemented. KM strategies, organizational culture and KM metrics are considered to examine the operations in dealing with career resources in a higher education institution (named as ‘C&amp;P department in institution X’ for reference) in Asia. Relevant data has been gathered through conducting interviews with director and staff. The findings indicate that the institution has a strong demand for knowledge sharing, in which a network filing system can be used to share important data within the organization. However, improvement in KM application can be seen as for having limited structural KM system embodied in the institution. Also, housekeeping can be further enhanced and more encouragement can facilitate higher level of sharing culture. It is recommended that the institution can enhance their knowledge management by using different KM strategies and tools together with interactive features, in order to reinforce existing platforms for more collaboration and more rapid sharing of career resources.



== &lt;u&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/u&gt; ==


===='''Background'''====

Recently, there has been growing awareness in KM in higher education. KM Team in libraries is one of the common departments, which starts adopting KM in the very first beginning. The implementation of knowledge management is now well established in some organizations like Ernst &amp; Young (EY) and Langham Place Hotel. These successful KM implementations have brought various benefits towards the companies through appropriate KM strategies and metrics.
 
As Rumizen (2002) pointed out that people tend to be inactive in receiving others’ sharing rather than giving feedback. As a result, this may discourage the initiative of sharing, and hence is one of the reluctances of knowledge exchange. Undoubtedly, organizational culture largely influences the degree of knowledge sharing. In the institution we interviewed, there is lacking of tools and incentives to support sharing culture. Therefore, employees are indifferent to participate in sharing. Besides, the opportunity to gather all staff together is little due to complexity within the department. 

It is suggested that Web 2.0 technologies can enhance the organizational culture. Web 2.0 facilitates participatory sharing, allowing information shared from different information providers. Though there are many researches regarding to the application of KM in commercial companies, application of KM in higher education institution, using Web 2.0 technologies are rarely investigated for this domain.



===='''Aims of study'''====

Since KM has been neglected in certain organizations, the institution is a case in point which has been investigated in this study. C&amp;P department is one of the departments in institution X, which engages in generating and handling tremendous information in daily operation. The professional knowledge of advisors which is one of the major knowledge needs to be captured and shared. Although the nature of the department is certainly to deal with knowledge and sharing is weighted as the important culture. However, the existing approaches do not embody a full picture of KM models for implementation, which may affect its accessibility and efficiency in terms of connecting people, KM system and evaluation of working process.
 
Therefore, this report aims at conducting an in-depth analysis on knowledge management practice on career resources in a well-known higher education institution in Asia, in order to evaluate the comprehensiveness and maturity of KM application within this department. It is undoubtedly that what they are doing is totally relevant to KM that knowledge sharing is a significant issue, which can be used to facilitate their work. Therefore, it is worth for spending effort and time to examine the application of KM in C&amp;P because of its job nature which is closely related to knowledge capture, exchange and preservation and they may have significant impact on the working process in C&amp;P. Last but not least, this report investigates the capability of technological innovations in university departments, which can facilitate a two-way knowledge exchange approach in order to meet a higher degree of knowledge sharing.


 
== &lt;u&gt;'''Literature review'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

Considering job nature of C&amp;P department, services provided are their main duties. Attitude of staff, level of collaboration between staff, use of latest information technology and adoption of knowledge management are factors affecting their performance. Therefore, references are sourced in these 4 aspects, including individual’s perception, organizational practices, technology, and implementation of knowledge management.



===='''Individual’s perception towards knowledge sharing'''====

Many people nowadays tend to keep their knowledge to themselves and rarely share with others. This is illustrated by Collison &amp; Parcell (2004) that people are afraid of allowing others know what they possess because competitive advantages may be lowered if others also share the same knowledge as theirs. Besides, according to Dalkir (2005), employees are reluctant to share their experiences with fellow colleagues and their counterparts for the reason that employees regard their own knowledge as assets. As a result, for the matter of knowledge sharing, people are generally not willing to circulate their explicit materials and tacit knowledge.  
 
Mayfield and Mayfield (2012) illustrated that feedback is important when experiences are shared within a community. However, Rumizen (2002) pointed out that most people only gather others’ sharing but seldom give feedback, which frustrates those people who take initiative to share, discouraging sharing culture. Consequently, no feedback will be a barrier for people to share. Collison &amp; Parcell (2004) demonstrated one of the reasons why people are not eager to share is that people think they will lose their knowledge during the process of knowledge sharing. Hence, from these peoples’ perspective, they cannot get the tangible benefits when sharing their knowledge. However, Hercheui (2012) pointed out that change in behavior of people can be foster by using the KM tools in order to accelerate the spread of explicit and tacit knowledge. Therefore, these tools mainly online technology can change people perception towards knowledge privacy.  
 
From the above perspectives, it can be concluded that people nowadays are still reluctant to share and in turn this hinders the knowledge flow as well as block the knowledge management. Chen (2011) shared the same view because research conducted showed that there is a significant relationship between knowledge-sharing attitudes and knowledge-sharing intentions. Staff employed by the university departments may also have similar attitude towards knowledge sharing.



===='''Practices of organizational culture'''====

Dalkir (2005) stated that organizational culture can generate cross-individual behavioral consistency such as shared values and shared mental models. Moreover, open organizational culture facilitates knowledge sharing as well as forming communities of practices (Collison &amp; Parcell, 2004). Hence, employees, who are encouraged to share, are more engaged in knowledge sharing activities. Furthermore, Nola (2012) reflected that knowledge transfer and sharing could be facilitated by the well-established policies and sharing culture of an organization. Consequently, organizational culture no doubt largely influences degree of knowledge sharing.
 
Rumizen (2002) observed that even if there are perfect hardwares such as knowledge sharing tools, knowledge sharing would not be successful. It can be explained by that employees are indifferent to participate in sharing under the organizational culture that promotes individual success rather than team spirit as a whole. Apart from that, Harorimana (2010) argued that individual and organizational culture could co-exist. When individual culture is exaggeratedly stressed, conflicts may be easily found and harmony of the organization would be destroyed. In this way, team spirit and open organizational culture can make knowledge management outcomes more obvious.



===='''Interactive technological innovation on knowledge sharing'''====

''Tools'''

After Wang’s (2012) investigation on informational platforms for educational purpose, the barrier of knowledge sharing could be eased by collaborative and advanced technology. Concerning collaboration, Connolly, Gould, Baxter &amp; Hainey (2012) suggested using Web 2.0 technologies for vocational training environment, where learning management systems could be further utilized. Preference is given to interactive features of Web 2.0 technologies. On top of that, Sampson &amp; Zervas (2012) illustrated using mobile platform is considered to be more efficient than web-based alone, in terms of user accessibility. These two technological innovations facilitate better two-way knowledge exchange between students and institutions.

 
''Services''

Socially oriented principles should be followed in Web 2.0 (Knol et al., 2008). Examples can be found in enterprise search tools that intelligent search reduces deployment time, improving knowledge sharing efficiency (Ghani, Djordjevic &amp; Cumby, 2011). Multimedia content search in addition to traditional textual ones channels users to designated resources more effectively, matching with the principle that both tangible and intangible resources are directed towards the right projects and people (Mvungi &amp; Jay, 2009).

 
''Adoption in an organization''

Depending on organizational culture, application of knowledge sharing tools may vary, resulting in benefits ranging from technology enhancement of existing platform to more unbounded collaboration (Bebensee, Helms &amp; Spruit, 2011). Web 2.0 is in a position bonding individuals in an organization more closely, which allows higher degree of knowledge sharing that everyone in it can contribute and add value to the system (Levy, 2009).



===='''KM in Higher Education'''====

According to Bridgstock (2009), the application of KM to the career center of the university can enhance and facilitate the employability in tertiary students because the self-management and career establishment skills can be transmitted to the graduates effectively if the KM is well implemented to the career center. Apart from that, based on Lamont (2011), after carrying out the KM, admission department in the university becomes one very process-intensive for the reason that large amount of information is well organized and the tacit knowledge of staff are also monitored through using the method of knowledge mapping so that the expertise of the staff are fully utilized. Apart from that tertiary students could get more diverse employment information when the University’ career center employed the Knowledge Management because of the fact that employment student advisers with various background expertise (for example business and social sciences) could give professional advice for the students from different faculties and disciplines (KM 2002 workshops targets decision-makers and beginners, 2002).
 
Besides, Ngulube and Mngadi (2009) stated that social interaction and knowledge sharing can be facilitated by the Communities of Practice (CoP) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the University of Zululand but policy of Cop is needed in order to enhance the efficiency of KM implementation. Furthermore, by implementing the Knowledge management, various explicit knowledge is captured and tacit knowledge is codified into documents so complete learning resources can be provided to students.  In the Higher Education in Britain, distance learning is greatly promoted because knowledge management helps to collect suitable information and knowledge to the learners (Open Text to provide Livelink to the UK academic community, 2002). 
 
Although there are articles regarding to the commercial organizational culture, the university departments’ cultures with the use of online platform, particularly Web 2.0 are rarely investigated. Hence, it is worth to spend time research this area.


 
== &lt;u&gt;'''Methodology'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

The source and data of this research report collected can be divided into two types, primary and secondary resources.


===='''Primary Research Resources'''====


''Interview''

An one-hour interview was conducted in March 2012 with Director and Student Advisor of C&amp;P. Notes and tape-record were made for the entire interview. The interview provided original resources, which show the real practices of implementing KM within the C&amp;P in terms of strategies, tools and metrics. This useful information illustrates a whole picture of the level of application of KM concept in a department within a university including the processes of capturing knowledge (tacit knowledge), documenting knowledge (explicit knowledge) as well as the KM tools which was being used in the department and how they were used to facilitate the knowledge sharing and meet the objectives of the department. The above data was gathered and analyzed with the findings (gaps) discovered from the literature review.
Since there was only one interview being conducted, the limitation of time has restricted the scope of our research that observation of C&amp;P’s working processes cannot be done. Otherwise, more in depth information may be collected.


===='''Secondary Research Resources'''====

Apart from the primary resources, a range of secondary resources were selected, for instance, scholar journals, theses and books regarding to the application and development of knowledge sharing in different organizations and higher education. These reliable resources are published materials and provided by different databases vendors with high credibility and authority, for example, ProQuest, EBSCOhost and so forth.
 
Besides, documentations such as brochures, PowerPoint slides and other printed materials related to the intranet (network filing system) were given during the interview. Information distributed on C&amp;P website was also captured for our research needs. It indicates one of the ways that C&amp;P keeps their information for open access.


 
== &lt;u&gt;'''Application of Knowledge Management'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

The application of KM in C&amp;P will be elaborated in details according to Dalkir’s (2005) integrated KM cycle model, which suggests that the KM processes should include creation, capture, sharing and dissemination, and acquisition and application.


===='''Knowledge creation'''====

C&amp;P generates a lot of new knowledge every day. Staff with different duties have different core functions and generate specific knowledge accordingly. For example, the Career Advisors who deal with students, they get the experience of handling the enquiries; also develop the expertise and skills to search related information in the knowledge base, so tacit knowledge is created. Then they input the enquiries and solutions to the knowledge base, so explicit knowledge is created. Take the staff that is responsible for organizing the workshops as another example; they need to find sources before giving speech to the audiences. Through referring to the best practices in career advising or listening to experienced colleagues, they get some new understanding or ideas about a specific subject, so tacit knowledge is generated. In addition, PowerPoint slides, worksheets, agendas and other useful resources are created by them for the workshop, so explicit knowledge is generated.


===='''Knowledge capture'''====

There are several methods for C&amp;P to capture and codify the tacit knowledge. They learn from history, learn from others, interview with partners and build a knowledge asset. If the department needs to organize similar activities, they will refer to and learn from the past experience. The department also learns from others, for example, the director regularly finds some information like the latest best practices in the foreign career advising industry, and then he tries to apply these practices in the department. Furthermore, the department captures tacit knowledge through interviews. It holds annual meetings with companies which have cooperated with them to organize activities, so the C&amp;P staff can get more ideas about the selection criteria, future plan or particular requirements of those companies. Last but not least, building a knowledge asset, the department has a central system that contains all important information that the staff has to know.
 
On the other hand, the department uses taxonomies to capture and codify the explicit knowledge. According to Rumizen (2002), taxonomy is a classification scheme that use for easy retrieval of specific information in a system. There are five layers in the hierarchical structure of filing system. Level 1 is the location of information; level 2 is the broadest term of information, and more specific information is in the subsequent levels. More details can be referred to Appendix I.


===='''Knowledge sharing and dissemination'''==== 

C&amp;P has regular meeting called ‘Work Coordination Meeting’ on weekly basis. In the meeting, the top management briefs upcoming activities in the coming two weeks. For example, there would be information about the venue, date and time, special arrangement of a recruitment talk. Staff is welcomed to raise any questions or topics that related to their works for further discussion. Open platform can be seen in the meetings. This kind of person-to-person interaction is a typical socialization style in an organization, which facilitates ‘Tacit-to-Tacit’ transformation of knowledge (Nonaka &amp;Takeuchi, 1995). Formal meeting is the most frequently used method for ‘Tacit-to-Tacit’ transformation of knowledge in the department. However, it is difficult to gather all staff sometimes, so the meeting cannot be held weekly.  A regular sharing practice might not be maintained since engaging all participants is necessary in knowledge sharing.
 
On the other hand, the department relies heavily on computer system to share knowledge among its staffs. The central system which stores all important information is the knowledge base and intranet of the department. It is accessible to staff only. Moreover, when the management gets useful information from recruitment fairs or conferences, they circulate the hard copy or send the soft copy through email to inform all staff. This practice allows as many staff engage as possible with the use of high-accessible platform.


===='''Knowledge acquisition and application'''==== 

There are two major types of knowledge application in C&amp;P, including Knowledge repositories / Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS) and Knowledge reuse. By definition, knowledge repository is an intranet platform that includes all the tacit and explicit knowledge of an organization which is collected from the experience and practices of staff (Dalkir, 2005). C&amp;P has set up a knowledge-based system which keeps all the knowledge like best practices in career advising, records of recruitment talks and student feedback records and analysis. It is regarded as an intranet. According to Bokhari and Poehlman (2003), Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS) is an electronic construction that uses to capture, store and disseminate the knowledge asset of individual or collective efforts. It helps the staff to work efficiently and effectively. The system assists in preserving the organizational knowledge asset, and improves the working performance and efficiency of the staff. For instance, Career Advisors can find relevant information in the system quickly and provide satisfactory answer to enquirers.

In addition, the staff can reuse the knowledge that contained in the system for different purposes. For example, reuse the PowerPoint slides for similar workshops; reuse the ideas and concepts for department planning, etc.


===='''Organization culture'''====

Organization culture sometimes is known as corporate culture, meaning the people there share the same norms, values, attitudes, beliefs and paradigm (Sathe, V., 1983). Actually, the implementation of KM is closely related to it, particularly related to the knowledge-sharing culture and collaborative climate.


===='''Knowledge-sharing culture'''====

Dalkir (2005) stated that the knowledge-sharing culture is one where sharing knowledge became the norm of the organization, and collaboration among people is encouraged. Knowledge is shared through different channels such as knowledge repository, emails. C&amp;P does not have any incentive system like rewards to encourage sharing. Since the manager believes that knowledge sharing is part of the corporate culture, there is no need to promote the message of knowledge sharing through incentives. In fact, it requires staff to document all activities in daily operation and upload all relevant information to the system from time to time by following the established departmental policies for the purpose of effective knowledge dissemination and sharing among the staff.


===='''Collaborative climate'''====

Sveiby and Simons (2002) suggested the assessment of collaborative degree of an organization, can be treated as an indicator of effectiveness of knowledge management. Other than the core functions, individual staff is encouraged to have knowledge in other aspects. There is no formal training provided for them, however, through self-learning and communication with other colleagues, they are expected to have the knowledge in other aspects. Staff’s workloads vary in teams and periods, based on the actual needs of the department in a specific period of time that staff may be assigned to other team for extra support. For example, when Survey Team does not have much works to do, part of staff in the team will be assigned to help Workshop Team consequently. Moreover, the department has launched many collaborative projects, which involve cross-team collaboration.


 
== &lt;u&gt;'''Analysis of case'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

“In actual practice, we manage the knowledge every day according to the flow and process of KM models, but we don’t have a structural KM system.” said Director of C&amp;P. The concept of KM does exist in the department, but the implementation and formalization of KM has yet been fully actualized. To successfully carry out KM within an organization, three critical elements should be embraced that are people, process and technology, and the balance of these three issues will lead to the success of KM (Collison &amp; Parcell, 2004). In the case of C&amp;P, although the department does not have formal KM system, it does have enabling technologies and established policies and process for the sharing of corporate knowledge. Furthermore, people who know and those who need to know are brought together to share knowledge. However, the top-down approach of knowledge sharing adopted by C&amp;P might not be the best style for knowledge management based on the Nonaka-Takkeuchi Model (Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995). The down side of the top-down approach is that the extent of knowledge sharing will be limited since this typical management style often overlooks the voices of frontline staffs. Frontline staffs normally accept all the knowledge and views that top managers shared without raising objections or alternative opinions due to their weak puissance. As a result, top-down management style might become a bottleneck of knowledge sharing.    

 
===='''Technology'''====

In terms of technology, C&amp;P has set up a knowledge-based system which keeps all the tacit knowledge like best practices in careers advising, records of recruitment talks and students’ feedbacks on careers talks or fairs. The system does not only assist in preserving the organizational knowledge asset, but also help to improve the working performance and efficiency of the staffs. In addition, the system is regarded as an intranet that is the only channel for knowledge sharing besides email. Insufficient channel for sharing knowledge might lower the sharing atmosphere.

 
===='''Process'''====

From the process point of view, C&amp;P makes clear policies and procedures to ensure the knowledge management process can be executed in a smooth way. The department requires its staffs document all activities in daily operation and upload all relevant information to the system from time to time by following the established departmental policies for the purpose of effective knowledge transfer, learning and sharing among the staffs.

 
===='''People'''====

From the perspective of people issue, the team spirit and open organizational culture are the positive motivators for advocating knowledge sharing among the staffs. Nevertheless, the top-bottom approach of knowledge management in the Unit resulted in discouraging knowledge sharing atmosphere among the lower-level staffs. The lower-level staffs always are the receivers and listeners of the knowledge provided by the top-level staffs, but they may have lower degree of sharing about feedbacks and experiences to the top management due to the lack of sharing channels and tools. For example, the top-level staffs will circulate the best practices in careers advising in foreign countries to the lower-level staffs via email or the knowledge-based system, yet there is no sufficient channel for lower-level staffs to express their opinions in those best practices or share their personal experience in careers advising.  
 
Additionally, the department utilizes KM strategies in managing the organization’s knowledge such as continuous improvement in intranet and the advancement in working procedures. Also, metrics and assessments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the practice of KM within the department can be practiced as well. Practice of KM in C&amp;P can be done in a more comprehensive way on top of the existing proactive ones.


 
== &lt;u&gt;'''Recommendations'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

In order to advance the maturity of KM practice and culture in a careers advising department, developing KM strategies and relevant metrics will be the prior tasks to achieve better knowledge sharing. Moreover, the amelioration of knowledge sharing platform and KM style might make the department to practice KM well.  
 
C&amp;P is suggested to develop KM strategies, which start with identifying staff needs and issues within the department. Then, several initiatives can be considered to execute, for instance, formalize communities of practice, organize knowledge sharing lunch, implement coaching and mentoring programs, and implement team collaboration tools and processes (Robertson, 2004). Metrics can also be subsequently developed for measuring the progress of the implemented initiatives. Brown (2010) suggests that an effective metric should comprise 4 types of measures, which are awareness, behavior, outputs and outcomes (see Figure 1). An effective metric should put 60% of the weight on output or outcome measures and 40% on awareness or behavior measures. When developing a metric, the department should avoid focusing on the quantity of KM activities and practices, for instance count the number of KM meeting or CoP. On the contrary, the qualitative analysis of KM practices is the most meaningful thing of the metric. For measuring output or outcomes, the department could measure how many new ideas or recommendations on improving the quality of career services has developed, and the impacts of that new knowledge on the organizational performance such as the productivity of department as well. For measuring awareness or behavior, it could measure the engagement of the staffs in KM activities. The participation level helps to indicate the staffs’ contribution and enthusiasm on the department. Additionally, KM behavior measures should track the use of collaboration tools among the staffs (Brown, 2010).    

Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) believe that effective knowledge sharing should involve both the top- and the lower-level employees. The top-down approach of knowledge management style in C&amp;P may not able to achieve the best sharing knowledge. As a result, the department is suggested to organize the bottom-top meetings for the lower-level staffs to raise suggestions to the top management. Apart from bottom-top meetings, forming a community of practice to gather different levels of staffs to share their experiences in careers advising can also strengthen the knowledge-sharing atmosphere within the department. 
 
To facilitate the communication and knowledge sharing, more communication platforms and tools are advised to practice. Web 2.0 technologies with interactive features such as Wiki and discussion forums help to make better two-way knowledge transfer, learning and sharing among staffs. It is believed that these kinds of platforms can enable and motivate the lower-level staffs to voice out their opinions easily, leading to activate knowledge-sharing culture. 


== &lt;u&gt;'''Conclusions'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

In conclusion, C&amp;P in accrual practice has applied the concept in terms of the flow and process of KM models with relevant information system. However, it can be observed that they may not have formal structural KM system. Surely, as the major target of C&amp;P is to meet their primary objectives including information keeping, activities documentation, and sharing of activity processes and knowledge for future use, the top-down approach acts as a guidance to lead the knowledge flow within the department. Such inactive sharing, however, has become one of the barriers in knowledge management. Nevertheless, the existing communication channels may not effectively facilitate the knowledge exchange among the staff in order to make the working process more efficient.
In fact, the general staff of C&amp;P, except senior staff, does not have a clear mind of KM application because of the implication of top-down approach. Since the existing knowledge management system in C&amp;P is established, it will be an added value for the department to improve their KM application in various aspects, for instance, forming a Community of Practice, and making good use of Web 2.0 in order to encourage higher level and degree of sharing culture, which is one of the important elements in success of KM implementation.

Kwok Pak Lun: The case study structured a lot of references to support the ideas which can be foreseen that the recommendations can mostly adopted by the department. It would be great if the writers can provided the feedback from the investigated department and state the limitation for their case study.

== Abstract ==

With the great improvement in efficiency and effectiveness towards the organizational performance, more organizations become increasingly aware that knowledge is their most valuable strategic assets and engage in developing knowledge management within their organizations. Based on an exploratory study of KM practices, this chapter will be focused on analyzing the application of Knowledge Management (KM) in the counseling unit in a tertiary institution. This chapter mainly provides a conceptual framework on how the KM strategies and tools are employed in the unit so as to help manage its knowledgeable resources. By considering the challenges encountered by the unit, the chapter will suggest some KM tools and strategies to cope with it. Further development trend in counseling industry and its feasibility will also be discussed in this chapter to grasp the idea of building and nurturing the knowledge sharing culture within the supporting unit.

== Introduction ==

This paper examines the current status of knowledge management and reviews the highlighted features of the traditional theory, definition and concepts, strategies and tools that involved in knowledge management in the departments of universities. Through conducting the research and doing the analysis on the key concepts of Knowledge Management, several phrases are identified which are Knowledge capture and codification, Knowledge sharing and dissemination and Knowledge creation. Benefits and shortcomings of the application of Knowledge Management in departments will also be summarized in this paper to obtain a clear picture on how Knowledge Management helps organize its knowledgeable resources effectively.

== Literature Review ==

The purpose of this literature review is to provide an overview of available publications investigating the theory and the application of knowledge management in both consulting industry and tertiary institutions. 

=== Knowledge Management ===
Sporleder and Moss (2002) defined KM as an integrated approach to identifying, creating, managing, sharing, and exploiting all information and knowledge assets of an organization. Later Dalkir (2011) further studied over a hundred published definitions of knowledge management and introduced ‘’knowledge management from the cognitive science or knowledge science perspective: Knowledge-the insights, understandings, and practical know-how that we all possess- is the fundamental resource that allows us to function intelligently’’ (p.6). 

=== Knowledge Creation ===
Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) defined that there are two dimensions of knowledge: tacit and explicit and brought its importance to organizational attention. Tacit knowledge is embedded in the expertise and experience of individuals and groups, not yet explicated (Leonard and Sensiper, 1998). Explicit knowledge is created in organisational rules, routines, and procedures so as to improve the efficiency. In Nonaka’s Model, it suggested that the key to knowledge creation lies in four forms of knowledge conversion. They are socialization, externalization, internalization and combination respectively.

=== Knowledge Capture and Codification ===
Knowledge capture and codification is an important process to an organization since learners can internalize the others’ knowledge and construct new form of knowledge. The knowledge generated from the interaction between the learners should be captured, stored and reused in order to maximize knowledge construction. Barchan (1999) suggested that six conditions, which are maintaining an open dialogue, sharing values, keeping knowledge flowing, embracing flexibility, building trust and surrounding with the right people, to enhance the knowledge capture among the whole organization. After capturing the knowledge, appropriate knowledge codification is needed to store the knowledge systematically. Janicot and Mignon (2012) proposed a model of the service’s time value and cognitive value, assessed through the integrative and interactive ITs used as a channel for codification. Time value refers to the time saved by using organizations’ cognitive resources. Cognitive value is regarded as the enhancement of quality and ability to indicate their competitive advantages to clients as a result of leveraging knowledge. Integrative technology means disseminating knowledge through database and interactive technology develops workplaces for sharing. Through this model, the methods utilized by the organization can be evaluated and spaces can be spot for improvement.

Knowledge SharingManagement consulting is an industry whose core product is knowledge itself. Managing knowledge is the most critical process in the consulting industry. (Sarvary, 1999) Hansen, Nohria and Tierney (1999) identify that there are two different knowledge management strategies employed by the consulting businesses which are codification strategy and personalization strategy respectively, as shown in Table 1.
Codification Strategy refers to the “strategy centres on the computer” in which the knowledge is being codified and stored in the designated databases. This allows the staff within the company can easily access and use the knowledge stored in the databases and encourages the reusability of knowledge in a large scale.
Personalization Strategy implies that “knowledge is closely tied to the person who developed it and is shared mainly through direct person-to-person contacts” such as face-to-face meetings, email, video conferences and telephone. This strategy focuses on communicating knowledge among people, not storing knowledge. The choice of KM strategy depends on the way the company serves its clients, the economies of its business, and the people it hires. Hansen, Nohria and Tierney (1999) also found that effective firms excelled by focusing on one of the strategies and using the other one in a supporting role. (Roughly an 80-20 split)


Knowledge Management MetricsKM Metrics is used to assess the effectiveness of KM strategies and applications. KM strategy should include the assessment framework that will be used to monitor progress toward and successful attainment of the targeted KM objectives and initiatives. (Dalkir 2005 p.268) There are several KM measurement techniques that can help assess how well an organization is progressing. For example, Benchmarking method is the search of industry-wide best practices that can lead to superior performance. It usually consists of a study of similar companies to determine how things are done best in order to adapt these methods for their own use. (Dalkir 2005, p.272) Besides, Balanced Scorecard Method provides feedback on both internal business process and external outcomes in order to continuously improve strategic performance and results. The result enables us to clarify the vision and the strategy and to translate them into action. (p.275) Moreover, there are four types of measures : Awareness, Behavior, Outputs and Outcomes (Brown, 2010). Awareness refers to whether we have the knowledge of what to document, how to document it, how to access KM databases. Behavior refers to whether the participation in KM activities is high or low to indicate high-level participation in key meeting. Outputs refer to whether there is any databases, white papers, lessons learned reports, best practice documentation. Outcomes refer to whether the impact of new knowledge on key measures of organizational performance is big or not.

=== KM Strategies and Tools ===
KM systems are usually designed to integrate the knowledge process into work processes. (Labedz, 2011) eGain® Service™ is a concrete example that is used to integrate knowledge management with customer relationship and services. Many companies such as HMV in Canada, WebCentre and Business Evolution’s @Once Service Centre used eGain to manage numerous daily e-mails to maintain customer relationships by learning customer knowledge management technique. Another one is WebFOCUS from Information Builders Inc. (ibi.com), which was being used by several higher education organizations including the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. (Lamont, 2011) Besides, YELLOW PAGES, which is a Web 2.0 tool, helps people within the organization to locate the person who possesses the expertise in solving a particular problem. (Rumizen, 2002) Recently, a more interactive Q&amp;A system is launched which allow users to ask questions and the system will response directly to the users with solutions provided. (Iske and Willem, 2005)
Carleton (2011) added that the organizational culture is important in nurturing KM. Many organizations like the World Bank and UN has used km4dev as a form of community of practice (CoP) to promote knowledge sharing. (KM4DevWiki, 2006) Nevertheless, some staff may be reluctant to share their individual knowledge in order to maintain their position. Amar (2004) suggested using people-oriented strategies to solve the case. This strategy focuses on encouraging the younger generation or new comers of the organization to share their own knowledge in order to create a knowledge sharing atmosphere. He also suggested the psychological driver like money incentive can also be a driven force in initiating KM.


Moreover, knowledge map is introduced as a tool to display internal members and their impact in terms of know-how, expertise and relational intelligent capital(IC) on the firm’s value chain. Here is a typical example of a knowledge map in SME with technical staffs and sales. The different activities of the firm are represented by oval shapes. Relevant activity coming from outside the firm is shown as a dashed oval shape.A – Head of Department – Process PlanningB – Group Leader – Electrical EngineeringD – Group Leader – Prototype AssemblyE – Managing Director – SalesF – Managing Director – Production and PurchasingG – Managing Director – Research &amp; DevelopmentAssistant – Assistant of GCNC – CNC ProgrammerBy locating the central expertise and skills held by a few members of staff, which the department highly dependent on, managers can understand the reason of the organization’s success. Moreover, the map allows information gathered about the types of knowledge that exist in the firm, enabling the managers to identify the areas where knowledge gaps may need to be filled. It therefore can be a guide for knowledge management for locating what to capture and know-who, which can be an initiative of further strategic moves on knowledge capturing.

To due with knowledge drain, structure interview can be arranged to the staff in order to produce a record of their knowledge, whether in audio, video, electronic or paper media. It helps capturing tacit knowledge to tangible knowledge. Similar to our research method, this intangible knowledge will usually be converted to produce a transcript, which can be accessed by any other staffs later. Since structured knowledge would preferably be recorded down, structure interview is more likely to be conducted. This allows no flexibility. All questions are pre-established. Experts, who have similar preliminary knowledge, are recommended to be involved in the interview to ask technical questions. Right questions should be formulated and asked, here is some typical types of questions which may be possible to be applied in counseling services:
Type of questions	Example
Knowledge             	What information did you use in making this decision, and how was it obtained?
Standard scenarios    	Does this case fit a standard or typical scenario? Does it fit a scenario you were trained to deal with?
Aiding                	If the decision was not the best, what training, knowledge, or information could have led to a better choice?
Errors                	What mistakes are likely to occur at this point? Did you acknowledge you’re your situation assessment or option selection could have been incorrect? How might a novice have acted or responded differently?



=== Challenges of KM in tertiary institutions ===
During the implementation of knowledge management in a tertiary institution, various difficulties may be encountered by the staff. Ian Caddy (2001) identifies some possible challenges in the implementation process. For example, staff in the organization may not know the existence of knowledge which has been stored in the database. Similarly, Frank McKenna (1997) also pointed out that some of the staff may not be familiar with the usage of software. This may lead to ineffective application of knowledge management. Another possible challenge may be the privacy and security problems against the information and knowledge stored in the database. Brankovic and Castro stated that there may be a risk of potential misuses from unauthorized tapping into the database and then retrieve the private information.Besides, Birkinshaw (2001) declared that many organizations actually managed their own knowledge through informal networks. In order to do it better, it “involves not only developing new tools, but alsoeliminating old ways of working”. As a result, it is difficult to change its culture which involves fundamental changesto people’s behaviour, and it typically takes many yearsto bring about.



=== Further development trend for knowledge management ===
Peng (2007) mentioned that people, technology and process are three key issues in KM research in 1990s. He suggested that the future of KM development should focus on a better integration of the common business processes, a concentration on the human-organization-interface and a better match of IT-aspects to human factors. With similar ideas, Holtshouse (2007) pointed out that raising the value of work, advancing workplace performance, reducing and streamlining work complexity and early detection of emerging market changes or disruptions should be the aims for the further development of KM.Besides, Kim (2007) also has an idea of having a better match of IT-aspects to human factors. He emphasized the linkage between information technology (IT) and knowledge management (KM). Kim (2007) criticized that many consulting firms only make use of some basic IT tools including email and search engines since they do not require much advanced knowledge for usage. It is suggested that managers should focus more on the matching of KM models and IT capability in order to maximize the benefits.Moreover, further development of KM can be done by combining theories together. Whelan et al. (2011) stressed on the superior benefits gained by combining talent management (TM) and knowledge management (KM) together. This demonstrates how TM can assist the implementation of KM throughout the KM life cycle. It includes knowledge talent identification, knowledge creation, knowledge sharing and positioning, knowledge competencies and knowledge retention. Whelan et al. (2011) suggested that the knowledge sharing of the top performing knowledge workers is the key to enhance the overall organizational performance and it is significant for the further development of KM within an organization.

== Methodology ==

Our research objective is to investigate what kinds of knowledge management activities have been implemented in the selected counseling unit. Firstly, qualitative approach was used to analyze the data collected from different sources such as in-depth interviews, books, journals and websites. Secondly, semi-structured interviews with the director of the unit will be also conducted so as to gather useful information. Four types of questions were asked to collect the information we need. They are simple fact, open-ended, judgment and comparison of fact questions respectively. Thirdly, we will analyze the information gathered from the interviews and summarize it findings discovered from books, journals and other sources.

== Case Study of the Counselling Unit ==
Our group has interviewed the director of the counselling unit, which has around fifteen to twenty professional staff and a number of officers. Some information that is relevant to our study is shown as follows:

=== Application of KM Strategies and Tools ===
==== Meeting ====
Two types of regular meetings are held to facilitate the knowledge sharing within the team. One is the 1-hour professional meeting which often holds every week. Counsellors and clinical psychologists are grouped together to review new cases during the week. They can freely express their opinions towards the cases or the problems they came across in order to provide better services for the students. Another type of meeting which mainly discusses its direction and daily operation usually holds once a month. Moreover, the director of the unit will visit each professional staff once a month so that the director can perceive their individual needs.
 
==== Internal Operational Guidelines ====
It has its own internal operational guidelines to ensure that the employees be aware and comply with the policies and working procedures to avoid any leakage of the private information.
 
==== Communicational Channels ====
Its major communication channel is email which mainly uses for transmitting the information about the daily operation or the problems encountered by the staff. However, they rarely use email for transmitting the case information between the staff since they are aware of the confidentiality of the collected data.
 
==== Information Search ====
The unit would prefer searching the information online through some search engines like Google rather than constructing its own online database. The staff will also search some journal articles and books through the libraries to enrich their knowledge on particular issues. They may also join as a member of The Hong Kong Psychological Society and refer to the postings on its forum to get more information.

==== Ways to evaluate and ensure the quality of service ====
Regarding quality control of services provided, there are four kinds of methods to evaluate the quality which are using the evaluation forms, managing complaints, supervising the performance of the employees and meeting with the staff regularly.
 
==== Evaluation form ====
The unit has prepared some evaluation forms and distributes them after each workshop completed. Students are required to complete the form and express their opinions towards the workshops.Based on the evaluation forms collected from the students, the staff will analyse the feedback from students and prepare a report to be submitted to the Personal Development and Counselling committee as a reference.
 
==== Complaints Received ====
The director suggested that managing the complaints received from students can be one of the indicators to spot out the problems in the unit and helps improve its operational efficiency.
 
==== Supervision ====
Supervising the performance of employees is a usual practice to ensure the quality of services provided. All the staff will be asked to attend several training or workshops each year to improve their capability on work. Besides, referential books will also be bought to enrich the knowledge they have.
 
 
==== Regular Meetings ====
In order to get familiar with each employee, the supervisors need to meet each staff individually to discuss about their case load or any problems they came across so as to ensure the quality of their performance.

=== Ways to manage information ===
 
==== Evaluation Forms ====
All evaluation forms received from the students are organized in statistics and saved as excel files.

==== Counseling Data ====
The data collected from students will be classified into three categories. They are problem areas and issues, demographic characteristics and statistics. They will then be stored in the database and share among the staff.

==== Details of Personal Enrichment Programmes ====
Students can retrieve the detailed information of the programmes through the leaflets or booklets printed by the unit as well as its web page. Some reference materials like time management tips can be retrieved from its website. E-learning platform is provided to allow students to acquire knowledge. On the other hand, the materials like Powerpoint slides presented in the programmes will be stored within  its own repositories.

== Findings and Analysis ==

=== Background of Implementing KM ===
This counselling unit aims at empowering the students to build up their own character and strengths. It also encourages the students to maintain a satisfying and psychologically healthy life. In order to help them develop a positive attitude towards life and contribute to the communities, the director of the unit believes that knowledge management is a way to achieve the goals.
Knowledge Creation
Knowledge Creation refers to the continuous process of new ideas through interactions between explicit and tacit knowledge between individuals. Through handling the complaints and evaluation forms received from the students, knowledge is created since the students’ comments are collected and being used to analyze their needs. Besides, the unit also offers different kinds of workshops and programmes to the students which stimulates the knowledge creation by lectures, storytelling or video shows. Apart from this, community of practice and experience sharing are introduced to support the knowledge creation within the unit. 

=== Knowledge Capture and Codification ===
Knowledge capture refers to the process of retrieving knowledge resides within people, artifacts or organizational entities. As mentioned by Barchan, there are six conditions that must exist if leaders want to foster learning, generate new knowledge and capture that knowledge to benefit the organization. They are maintaining an open dialogue, sharing values, keeping mobile knowledge, embracing flexibility, building trust and surrounding yourself with the right people. As regards maintaining an open dialogue, employees in the unit have enough opportunities to contribute their opinions and suggestions through regular meetings. Monthly meetings can help tracking all employees to follow the core values of the unit in order to drives a consistent and long-lasting operation.Information and knowledge can be captured by employees through a variety means which facilitates the mobility of the knowledge flow, i.e. share folders. They are also encouraged to join workshops which broaden their horizons to other fields of counselling service. The employees work as a team with common aims nurtures a knowledge sharing culture which facilitates knowledge capturing a lot. 
From the Janicot and Mignon’s model, time value and cognitive value are the indicator to evaluate the knowledge codification methods. The counselling unit makes use of shared folders, particular database and electronic case files. Stored past cases, workshop materials and statistics of the counselling cases can be used to evaluate the quality of service which reaches high cognitive value.
==== Possible Challenges and Solutions ====
As regards the time value of the enquiries services, there may be a challenge of the staff to answer ad hoc questions. In case there is a student asking questions about the programs of the person enrichment workshop, they need to find out the answers from the leaflets and the website of the unit which is time-consuming. To due with this problem, an interactive Q&amp;A system mentioned by Iske and Willem can be launched which allows the staff to type in the enquiries and the system will response directly to them with solutions provided.

Besides, since the counseling unit is relying heavily on tacit-to-tacit knowledge sharing, valuable tacit knowledge may not be retained completely. In addition, due to the high turnover rate of the professionals, knowledge drain may be aggravated. Arranging structure interview for the leaving staff can mitigate this potential problem by capturing the tacit knowledge from them into explicit documents.

=== Knowledge Sharing and Dissemination ===
Since this supporting unit regards “knowledge” as the core asset of the unit, it applied both “Personalization Strategy” and “Codification Strategy” to retain the valuable and useful knowledge.

==== Personalization Strategy ====
The director of the unit plays an essential role in promoting the sharing atmosphere within the team. Meetings are held to facilitate the knowledge sharing within the team. Opportunities are given to the counsellors and clinical psychologists to freely share their opinions towards the cases or the problems they came across. It is a kind of knowledge exchange from person to person. Apart from the meetings aforementioned, as the unit only comprises of twelve to fifteen professional staff, it is easy for them to gather together at lunch time and discusses the problems they have encountered. They can also simply send an email to transmit the information about the daily operation and share with one another. They are also a kind of socialization in which the tacit knowledge is shared via social interactions. 

==== Codification Strategy ====
“Knowledge repository” is being used by the unit which can enable multiple users commonly share the resources together. The formal internal knowledge such as the internal operational guidelines, counselling data, student information and training materials is being codified and stored in the designated databases for the staff to access and use. This can facilitate the search and retrieval of the relevant data by the staff. Personal tacit knowledge is converted into the form of explicit knowledge and shared. Explicit to Tacit knowledge conversion is also involved in this case since the staff can make use of existing knowledge codified and internalizes others’ shared experience in problem-solving.
Besides, with reference to the collected counselling data and student information, the data collected from students will be classified into three categories. They are problem areas and issues, demographic characteristics and statistics. They will then be stored in the database and share among the staff. This can show us that the discrete pieces of explicit knowledge is being recombined and converted into a new form of explicit knowledge like report and statistics and shared in the database.

==== Possible Challenges and Solutions ====
After analysing the knowledge sharing system in the counseling unit, there may be a lack of systematical storage of specific knowledge. As mentioned by the director, some of the counselors have their own specialties like Developmental Dyslexia and they possess their own particular collections in their rooms. The unit may suffer a great loss of knowledge in particular fields if the specialties are gone with the counselors.  Thus, a regular storytelling held by the counselors is suggested to fill in this knowledge gap among them.

Moreover, it may not be sufficient for the counseling units to share the information with other units in their department only once a month. The director mentioned that the departments are not frequently interacted with each other, instead of when holding a big project together. Knowledge map is suggested to be implemented so as to allow the staff in the units and also the outsiders especially the students understand their scope of management.

=== KM Metrics ===
KM Metrics is used to assess the effectiveness of KM strategies and applications. KM strategies should include some assessment framework to monitor the process of the KM applications so that the target of the KM strategy can be accomplished. As for the unit, there are internal organizational guidelines and crisis guidelines explicitly outlining the working process for the new staff. The experienced staff will supervise the newly employed staff’s performance. Moreover, PRSD, which is a kind of appraisal form, is used as an assessment framework to monitor the employee’ progress. The unit also establishes some evaluation forms to collect feedback from the students in order to further improve its performance. The unit also produces both qualitative and quantitative figures and statistics regularly in terms of the problem areas, faculty, sex etc. With the aids of the reports, the staff may find out what problem is frequently encountered by students and do the corresponding actions.

According to Brown, there are four types of measures for the KM metrics. They are Awareness, Behaviour, Outputs and Outcomes respectively.

==== Awareness ====
The unit has a systematic way to organize the documents. Their documents are divided into 3 categories which are counselling data, case notes and training materials. They have a separated database to store the counselling data which contain the client personal information. The case notes are stored in case file and the files are organized in a systematic way. The training materials are stored in a shared folder in the intranet and particular staff can access it providing he has the access right.

==== Behavior ====
Meeting is the main communication channel used by the unit. It conducts regular meeting once a month to discuss about the main goal of the unit. Some meeting held once a week for the senior staff to review the cases in the past week. Moreover, the director of this unit will visit each senior staff office to have an informal meeting. The top manager frequently participates in different meeting, which enhance the knowledge sharing, hence it can help documentation of valuable knowledge that currently only resides in senior employees' heads, and minimizing the impact of valuable employees retiring or quitting by first documenting what they know and have learned over the years.

==== Output ====
It is seldom to form some lessons learned report within the unit but they can shared their experience in any meeting freely. For example, they will send a staff as a representative of the unit when there is a big function like Orientation to join the representatives of other departments and form a group. This staff will share his or her experience in the regular meeting.

==== Outcomes ====
It does not have any key measure like sales and cost reduction. By improving the processes, this helps save the cost and improve the productivity of the unit.

=== Future Development of KM in Counselling Service ===
In the literature review and case learned, the success of knowledge management is not just dependent on organizational culture like staff leadership but also on the general fiscal climate which may affect the implementation of the technology that support KM. A concrete financial support is the first priority in consideration to continue the activation of the knowledge sharing culture in the future KM development.
The competing demands and budgetary constraints experienced by this counseling department shows that the knowledge management is not a new initiative, but as a reframing of information sharing and evidence-informed decision making. Still, patience is needed to let the developmental process of knowledge management.
Knowledge management needs a permanent supporter who believes in the positive changes that KM will bring. Hiring a particular knowledge manager, the whole student resources centre of university including counseling part will be overlooked on knowledge practices. He/She may be retrospectively see what has been accomplished and the future needs that remain to be addressed as management always has space to be improved.
Furthermore, the term “professional” should not be a box limiting the sharing of knowledge. The current turnover rate of professional may be an opportunity for recruiting new staff with common value in knowledge practices. The talent and willingness of working in collaborative environment of psychological expertise as well as other professional discipline would be the basic requirement in this knowledge age.
Last but not least, it is important to have an ideal but also work hard toward the next best approach when current KM strategies are not sustainable for current circumstance, since knowledge management model needs to be flexible to accommodate rapid change under the information age. The upcoming development will be perhaps focusing on the sustainability of current approaches on KM as well as innovation strategies in foreseeable prospect.

== Conclusion ==

All in all, knowledge management tools and strategy can undoubtedly bring benefits to the counselling unit. The tacit knowledge can be captured in explicit form well and shared across the companies so that all staff can reach a certain standard of knowledge. The explicit knowledge can be managed more systematically and further enriched in the database. Therefore, it is a global trend to utilize KM tools and strategies properly in order to maximize the benefits. However, not all KM tools and strategies are suitable to every industry. Tailor-made KM tools and strategies are needed when the counselling unit applys those tools in order to match its cultures and usual practice. From the case study, we recognize that some common KM practices are not adopted by it as there are difficulties to tackle the privacy problem with high cost. However, in long run, the cost of the KM tools may be possibly declined due to a massive demand of them since they are getting more popular in this knowledge age.

Please post your comments here.

Ma Yim Hing: The Literature Review is too long. And for the four types of measures of the KM metrics,it is better to provide some methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the KM applications in these 4 aspects instead of simply mention what does the department do in these aspects.


Stephanie Tsui: It would be better if a summary is added to Literature Review to provide a scope.


Lee Pui Yee, Wendy: For the Literature Review, it is better to add the rationale to further explain why this review has those sub-parts. Besides, the potential difficulties may be stated in the &quot;Future development of KM&quot; part. Recommendations may be added. 



Kwok Pak Lun: In the Future Development of KM in Counselling Service part, the writer stated the collaboration culture should be developed in the department. However, there are no concrete suggestion for how to develop the collaboration culture. The writer may consider to add more concrete solutions or practices to help improve the development of KM in the department.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Abstract==

This case study aims to investigate the knowledge management (KM) practices in a department of a university in Asia, which offers general education to students, and provide advices for improvement.
According to the literature, KM is has been implementing in business world, however, the success of KM in higher education field is still under determined. To investigate the effectiveness of KM in the department, the integrated knowledge management cycle is used to construct the current view of KM. Furthermore, KM metric and G-KMMM are applied to address the Key Process Areas, namely people, process and technology that can be improved. The finding also implicates those Key Process Areas are co-related with each other. What’s more, the maturity assessment shows the department was at initial stage and the infrastructures and strategies were not be able to facilitate the capturing and sharing of knowledge in the department.
In the recommendation session, room for improvement is identified. Recommendation, including the application of KM strategies, KM technologies, and culture, are given based on the process, technology and people aspect of KM development in the department respectively. However, this study only focuses on how KM can be implemented by different tools in a higher education environment but does not cover the long term KM performance in the department. It is recommended more studies should be conducted to investigate how KM can affect the organization’s long term performance.


==Introduction==

With increasing amount of organizations notice the significance of their labor force’s knowledge, as assets leveraging competitive advantage (Drucker, 1999), this gives rise to the emergence of Knowledge Management (KM). While Knowledge Management aims to develop strategies for organizations to manage the knowledge creation, sharing and application, it enables them to reach their organizational goals more efficiently and effectively (Dalkir, 2005).
A literature research reveals a number of publications targeting knowledge management in higher education institutions which is for educational purposes (Metcalfe, 2006; McCarthy, 2006). However, there is a lack of research focusing on the possibility of implementing KM within higher education institutions in a department scale, and how KM implementation could help these departments to share and disseminate knowledge, not only to its external customers, but also its internal staffs.
There is where this research joins in. This particular field of KM is explored by conducting interviews and surveys in a department which is responsible for providing general education to students in a university in Asia. This research would like to shed light on the following research questions:
How knowledge management can help sustaining knowledge within a small size department with minimum resources? What knowledge management approaches can facilitate maximum efficiency and effectiveness in knowledge sharing, so knowledge can reach as much audience with a limited resource?
The investigated department is very small. It serves the whole university by limited resource. Knowledge management thus becomes a significant and useful tool in enabling effective knowledge sharing. While in this research, questions above are addressed by two steps: 1) Evaluate its current KM implementation level; 2) Spot out the problems and give constructive suggestions.


==Background of the department==

In 1995, a university in Asia established a department that aims to provide whole-person education to students. It is a small department with a high turnover rate. In 2012, there are only 8 staff in total. The department operates in Person-In-Charge (PIC) approach and staff work as project-based. The job role can be summarized into three categories: Director, PIC and Organizing Committee (OC).
:'''Director'''
::* Monitoring the progress of different events
::* Setting the directions and objectives of the upcoming academic year
::* Promoting sharing culture within the organization
:'''PIC'''
::* Making decisions for in-charged event
::* Planning workflow and distributing workload
::* Keeping track of progress of event in charged
:'''OC'''
::* Performing administrative task for the events
Each year, the department provides more than 40 programmes on a variety of topics. The programmes are in different formats such as seminars, workshops and field trips in order to stimulate students’ critical thinking.

==Literature Review==

===Introduction===

There has been arousing concerns about knowledge management in organizations. University, the place where knowledge is created, shared and used, put emphasis on this field. To investigate the knowledge management practice in the department that we concern, it is good that we understand knowledge management well beforehand. In this literature review, knowledge management is introduced with knowledge management cycle followed by the way of measuring knowledge management practice as well as the criteria for improvement. A knowledge collaboration platform for educational institutions, Integrated Knowledge Space (IKS), will also be introduced.

===Knowledge management and KM cycle===

Knowledge management, as defined by Teruya (2003), is the systematic process of identifying, capturing, and transferring information and knowledge held by an organization and its employees, and by doing so, the intrinsic value of knowledge can be leveraged and shared within the organization, and eventually, these value could foster competitiveness and innovation, and in turn, generate revenue (Curley, 2001; Dash, 1998; Hibbard, 1997).

To illustrate the process of knowledge management, a number of knowledge management cycles, which were built by different specialists, like Meyer &amp; Zack, Bukowitz &amp; Williams, McElroy and Wiig, have been introduced. To make it easier to understand, the integrated knowledge management cycle summarizes those cycles. There are 3 components in the integrated knowledge management cycle, namely knowledge capture and creation, knowledge sharing and dissemination, as well as knowledge acquisition and application (Gibran, 2005). For knowledge capture and creation, it is the process of recording and generating of new knowledge. For knowledge sharing and dissemination, it is the exchange of knowledge among people. Knowledge is personalized and distributed to the right persons. For knowledge acquisition and application, it is the process of identifying the relevant knowledge and developing systems to extract the knowledge followed by applying knowledge to suitable case and evaluating the outcome as well as learning from it (Pakirh, 2001).

There are four factors which facilitate the operation of KM cycle, namely KM strategy, KM metrics, technologies and KM team. First, developing a KM strategy is the first step to lead to information management success in an organization. The strategy should find out the problems that the organization is facing and come up with solutions to those problems (Robertson, 2004). The KM approach and prioritization of the alternatives which benefit the organization most should be identified (Dalkir, 2005). Second, since it is difficult to measure the performance of knowledge management, standardize metrics is needed to quantify the measure (Bose, 2004). Brown proposed KM metrics as the measurement for KM success. KM metrics are comprised of four measures which are awareness, behavior, outputs and outcomes (Brown, n.d.). Awareness refers to the organization’s knowledge of what and how to do concerning knowledge management. Behavior is people’s participation to the knowledge management activities. Outputs are the products of knowledge management practices. Outcomes bring impacts to the organization’s performance. Third, technologies help manage knowledge in the organization by acting as the medium for the flow of knowledge (Borghoff &amp; Pareschi, 1997). Fourth, KM team is a group of professionals with different skills, attributes and backgrounds who work together to enhance the knowledge management practice in an organization. A good KM team should have sound communication, leadership, KM tools, strategic planning, knowledge of the organization, connection with the top, systems view and risk taking preparation (Dalkir, 2005). The Integrated KM Cycle is operated in the culture, which is the external factor that affects its performance.

===Application of Knowledge management maturity model===

Pee and Kankanhalli proposed the General Knowledge Management Maturity Models (G-KMMM) based on the review of different Knowledge Management Maturity Models to guide and assess the progress of knowledge management in an organization (2009). Their investigation emphasized the importance of people, process and technology factors to knowledge management development. Their proposed model put KM maturity level of an organization into 5 categories, namely initial, aware, defined, managed and optimizing. Their KM maturity assessment instrument had been tested in a big university. Their empirical study demonstrated G-KMMM was a good assessment tools for KM development.

===Criteria for improvement of knowledge management practice===

KM enablers are the stimulate elements of KM. It refers to the building of an infrastructure that facilitates KM. It helps to maintain a sustainable and systematic development of organizational knowledge. Lee and Choi pointed out that the KM enablers could be classified according to the socio-technical theory (2000). They assumed that there were two types of interacting system in an organization, namely social system and technical system. Social system referred to people, organization structure and organization culture. Technical system included processes and technology. They believed that KM enablers were the significant predictors for non-financial performance of an organization. Further, Ho also introduced an explanation of the relationship between KM process indices and KM enablers in addition to the previous researches (2009). He brought up five types of enablers in KM, namely culture, information technology, evaluation, strategy and leadership, which is more comprehensive when compared with Lee and Choi’s study. In his finding, he discovered that KM enablers had positive relationship with KM process indices. However, there was no significant positive correlation between the number of employees and KM process performance indices. Those researches showed that KM enablers were important control keys in the planning stage of KM.

===Further KM development in Education – Integrated Knowledge Space (IKS)===

Knowledge management in educational institution is different from that in business organization. As mentioned by Chavez, knowledge management is not only about capturing, storing and sharing of knowledge, it should include the effectiveness of collaboration and the way to improve the entire knowledge sharing system (2011). Schrage defined collaboration as the process of interacting and sharing of understandings of the same objects among individuals (1990). This can be applied to the university. Some studies suggested that interdisciplinary and cross-department collaborations should be adopted in the platform in order to fully utilize the knowledge resource (Tikhomirov et al., 2009). In addition to above studies, Tikhomirov, Tikhomirova, Maksimova and Telnov suggested that this kind of collaboration activities could be extended to all educational institution and formed the Integrated Knowledge Space (IKS) (2009). IKS is a platform which integrates the faculties, scholars and business people within the framework of distributed departments. (Tikhomirov et al., 2009). It can help higher educational institutions to achieve student’s self-learning as well as synergetic integration of educational and innovative process.

==Methodology==

This research aims at investigating knowledge management practices in a department of a university in Asia that offers general education to students. Two interviews were conducted with Dr. A, the Assistant Director and Mr. B, the Senior Executive Assistant of the department on 6th and 7th March 2012. Both interviews lasted for an hour and were taped with prior permission. The information that they provided were the main sources for this research.

A survey was also conducted for the staff of the department. There were 8 questions in the questionnaire which were classified into three categories. The first part gathered the respondents’ background information, the second part focused on their proficiencies in computer literacy and the third part collected their perceptions on knowledge sharing. 7 copies of questionnaire were distributed, but only 4 were returned. Due to the low response rate, the data collected were not comprehensive enough that it will only be considered as additional reference for the this study.

==Applications of KM and Finding analysis==

After interviewing the Assistant Director and the Senior Executive Assistant of the department, certain level of KM practices are identified within the department. In this part, applications of KM are categorized and analyzed using the framework of Integrated KM Cycle (Dalkir, 2005) (Noted that &quot;KM Teams&quot; is intentionally omitted, the reason will be explained in the limitation part of the report) and we aim to: '''See Figure 1'''



:# Identify the current application of KM in the department by knowledge processing phrases
:# Measure the level of KM implementation in the department by KM Metrics
:# Analyze the KM Maturity level of the department by Knowledge Management Maturity Model (KMMM)

===Application of Knowledge Management===

In order to identity and better understand the current KM practices in the department, the integrated KM cycle is used as a framework in our study. The three processing phrases in the KM cycle, namely &quot;knowledge capture and creation&quot;, &quot;knowledge sharing and disseminating&quot; and &quot;knowledge acquisition and application&quot;, are used to categorize the current KM activities within the department and the identified KM practices are as follows: 

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr style='background-color:#b0c4de;'&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;Knowledge processing phrases&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;Existing representative KM Practices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;Knowledge Capture and Creation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Workplace Retreat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge Capture and Codification&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;Knowledge Sharing and Disseminating&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Community of Practice (CoP)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;Knowledge Acquisition and Application&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge Reuse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge Repositories&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

====Knowledge capture and creation====

:'''Workplace Retreat (靜修)'''
:A “workplace retreat” programme was introduced to the department by the Assistant Director in last semester. Workplace retreat is an innovative programme which prompts not only knowledge creation but also knowledge sharing within the organization. As De La Mothe &amp; Foray (2001) suggests, informal social activities outside workplace like retreat can serve as an appropriate instruments for a firm’s learning strategy. While staffs are invited to travel out of office, the peaceful surrounding could help stimulating reflections and brainstorms. It was aimed, by such platform, to create a strategic direction for the department and set themes for projects of next academic year. 

:With specific activities held during the retreat, knowledge sharing culture can also be established in retreats. Hughes (1999) suggests that holding retreats can be a good opportunity for organizations to identify barriers to collaboration and to build bridges to improve communication, trust, and cohesiveness among staffs. Thus, it can encourage staffs to share their ideas. After all, a year plan will be constructed base on the ideas generated during the retreat. 

:'''Knowledge Capture and Codification'''
:Structured method of capturing and codifying, no matter tacit or explicit knowledge, was not commonly found within the department. It might due to the lack of awareness that the organization’s knowledge has to be captured, organized and managed in a systematic way, so it can be retained can converted into organization’s asset. In the interview, we could only identify unstructured, elementary level of knowledge capture and codification. In summary, there is only one key practice for this category: Learn from others.

:By participating in different conference, exhibits or events held by similar educational organization, the department was able to learn from the experience of others. Indeed, community of such is an emerging form of tacit knowledge development where people can learn from each other (Binney, 2001). However, since the department did not intend to do any knowledge capture or codification, it limited the actual outcome for participating in these events.

====Knowledge sharing and disseminating====

:'''Community of Practice (CoP)'''

:Community of Practice, according to Lave &amp; Wenger (1991), is a group of people who share a profession. It is hoped that by communication and sharing among the members, they can learn from each other and develop themselves personally and professionally (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991). CoP is, again, not intentionally held in the department. Yet, we found that an elementary level of CoP exist and run quite smoothly in the department. By holding weekly meetings and project evaluation meetings, staffs are asked to gathered and share their knowledge on event hosting and project management. As claimed by the Senior Executive Assistant in the interview, it had been proof an effective way for staffs to learn experience form history and from each other.  However, as the CoP was not well-organized, given that no CoP roles (e.g. Facilitator, Champions) are defined, it was not well structured for sharing knowledge. To conclude, there is still a long way for CoP fully developed its potential benefit towards the department.

====Knowledge acquisition and application====

:'''Knowledge Reuse'''
:To make knowledge reusable, there are there main roles during the process (Markus, 2001):

::'''Knowledge producer:''' The original creator of the knowledge
::'''Knowledge intermediary:''' The one who packages and prepares the knowledge so that it can be stored, retrieved, and shared. This may involve any number of functions such as indexing, categorization, standardizing, publishing, mapping, etc.
::'''Knowledge consumer:''' The recipient and user of the knowledge in question.

:The knowledge intermediary plays a crucial role in building up objects library, to make knowledge objects available, so knowledge consumer can reuse the knowledge and avoid time wastage in reinventing the whole object.

:The department has long established a physical document library for the storage of past projects materials, including proposals, forms, letters, etc. These materials are used as reference for future project development. These documents are categorized according to timeframe, and placed in several corners in the office. As these materials are in paper form and they are not placed in order, staffs claimed that it is hard for them to retrieve the resources. In most cases, instead of searching for the old documents, they would tend to seek help directly from the former PIC of the particular event. It shows that knowledge reuse is not well developed in the department.

:In contrast, the department did a great job in performing a knowledge intermediary job externally. The department organized numerous events and seminars in the past years, and it accumulates a rich level of knowledge objects and resources. To make the knowledge objects available for reuse, the department has set up an external archive for storing and disseminating the video clips and event materials of workshops and seminar. Though it was reported that the usage rate was not very high due to the material content and promotion of the archive, it is a good direction for the department to make these knowledge objects available on the web and reusable in the future.


:'''Knowledge Repositories'''
:An internal document archive was set up to serve as a digital central storage tool. It presented as a share folder, which every staffs have to right to access, put files and share with each other. The internal archive aimed to centralize all the event documents for future reference. Especially when there is a high turnover rate in the past few years, new comers often found that they can barely catch up the administration work. Therefore, the internal archive was established with guidelines written from the staffs, so to ensure new comers can take up their job quickly and efficiently. However, as no one was assigned to manage of the internal archive, the archive is not well organized and maintained. Furthermore, as not all project documents were being collected, so some information was missing.

===KM Metrics===

According to Dalkir (2005), KM metrics include quantitative, qualitative, and anecdotal methods to measures how well KM is implemented within the organization.  
There are 4 KM metrics, namely awareness, behavior, output and outcome (Brown, n.d.).

====Awareness====

Awareness refers to knowledge of what to document, how to document it, how to access KM data base, etc (Brown, n.d.).

In the interview, they were asked what type of knowledge they would be documented. They said lots of documents were documented in share drive including temporary files and draft, but some of them are not co-relate to any meaningful outcome. There is no staff organizes the share drive and classifies what type of knowledge should or should not be documented. In addition, there are lots of informal meetings within the department. However, no records or minutes were taken in the meetings.

Besides, they said they would seek helps from different people when they have troubles rather than find the solution from the share drive. It shows that staffs in the department do not have the concept of knowledge management. They watch for knowledge everywhere when they require and depose it when they do not need it. The knowledge were lost instead of retaining in the department as their asset. So the staffs have use long time to find for the solution when they face the same problem.

====Behavior====

Behavior refers to participation in KM activities such as committees/teams, making presentation, etc. (Brown, n.d.).

When communication practice was concerned, both the Senior Executive Assistant and the Assistant Director said they communicated with other very frequently. All the staffs would participate in weekly meeting. The meeting was causal and aims to report the progress of the event that they were organizing. However, other KM related activities like mentorship programme were not well-participated within the department. For example,  the mentorship programme should be a senior staff as a mentor and a junior staff as a mentee to form a pair or group in order to share their knowledge and skills, but not all the staffs were joined the programme and the programme was not smoothly run during a period of times.

====Output====

Output refers creation of data bases, white papers, lessons learned reports, best practice documentation, etc. (Brown, n.d.).

In the interview, two interviewees were asked whether there is any guideline for their work and they responded that there is no such thing in their department. They were also questioned about “do you have policies or guidelines for your work? If so, how do you access these kinds of documents or materials?” and “What sort of orientation or refresher training have you received?” The two dedicated interviewees presented there did not have any official guidelines or training materials for their reference.

Apart from these, there is a few lecture materials were provided by the department to public including student. The lecture materials such as lecture notes and videos were uploaded to the department archive randomly, not all the related materials were provided and accessed by all students.

====Outcome====

Outcome is the impact of new knowledge on key measures of organizational performance such as new product sales, productivity, cost reduction, or quality improvement (Brown, n.d.).

The interviewees were asked questions like “how do you add value to the department?” The assistant director responded how his past working experience can streamline the working process in this department now. The senior administrative assistant of the department responded the experience how he taught his colleagues use mail merge function to send mass email to the students and made some tutorials and white papers for how to use some specific functions in the software. After this practice, no staff needs to send thousands of similar emails one by one and hence the productivity of the department is higher than before.

It can be seemed that the interviewees experienced the advantage gained from knowledge management. However, since their KM just start from the initial stage, the level of outcome that created by KM was not apparent. Nevertheless, from the above four KM metrics, it can find that the practice of knowledge retaining and sharing within the department is at the low level.

===General Knowledge Management Maturity Model (G-KMMM)===

As proposed by Pee and Kankanhalli (2009), the general-KM maturity model (G-KMMM) integrated the existing KM maturity models and illustrated the life cycle of KM in an organization. G-KMMM composed 5 stages (see Appendix).

:#'''Initial''' – No or little recognition of manage organization knowledge asset
:#'''Aware''' – Organization starts to recognize knowledge management, but it does not have guidance on what to do
:#'''Defined''' – Organization has assigned resources or infrastructures to support KM
:#'''Managed''' – KM initiatives are well recognized
:#'''Optimizing''' – KM is profoundly integrated with organization strategies and demonstrated improvements to the organization

To further investigate the KM development in an organization, Pee and Kankanhalli (2009) characterize each maturity level in context of Key Process Area (KPA) which included people, process and technology perspectives.

Their model is structured into assessment instrument for both academic and practice of KM development. In the following part, the G-KMMM assessment questions proposed by Pee and Kankanhalli (2009) are used for investigating the KM maturity level of the department.

People, as a KPA, include perspectives on organization culture, strategies and polices (Pee &amp; Kankanhalli, 2009). Through the interview, we could conclude that the department was able to recognize knowledge as an important element for the department to grow in long term. The assistant director realized and kept emphasizing the problems on knowledge transitions (e.g. lack of job training for new staff). Both of the two interviewees understood and agreed knowledge management can help providing better working environment and sustain the development of the department. Every week, sessions were held for the staff to share the experience or issues encountered in the week. The face-to-face discussions were intensive in the department. The senior staffs were willing to sharing the knowledge and willing to answer questions from juniors. The top management (e.g. assistant director) was active to participate in staff discussion. However, it can be seen that they did not have a clear vision and planning for KM, it can be concluded they had not implement all the key practices at maturity level 3. To summarize, the department was at level 2 in maturity for people KPA.

As described by Pee and Kankanhalli (2009), the process KPA refers to the KM activities in the organization. With regard to the process KPA, the department used shared drive to store routine documents. However, there was no formal guideline or process to indicate what document should be store, how to update the content and who shall be the one to update. Since there was no responsible person to manage the share drive, the staffs just asked their colleagues, leaving the share drive idle. To conclude, the department only able to achieve at level 1 maturity in process KPA.
For technology, it can be considered as internal and external infrastructures that support KM. Internally, the department did not have any pilot project about KM. The staff relied heavily on local document storage (e.g. the files on their own computer) and the share network drive only worked as an external storage place for the staffs.

For external, the department serviced as central hubs for students to learn about general issues other than their own disciplines. The department organized plenty of seminars and workshops throughout the year. Some of the seminars will be video captured and uploaded on the web archive. However, the online archive only offered simple playback function for the video. The access rate of the online archive was low. It can be summarized that the technology KPA was at level 1.

After the KM maturity evaluation, the comprehensive overview of KM can be structured. It can be seem that the department demonstrated a good atmosphere for KM to grow in terms of organization culture and the initiative of the top management. However, the management seemed did not have a clear KM planning and strategies. And the technology could not support staff capture and share the knowledge in the department. It can be considered that the KM maturity level was at level 1, more effort should be put on process and technology KPA.

==Recommendation==

As mentioned in the previous section, G-KMMM suggested that process, technology and people are Key Process Areas that should pay attention to for improvement. They are closely related to each other that the failure of either one will affect the whole KM implementation. Therefore, KM strategies(for process), KM technologies(for technology) and culture(for people) are emphasized to bring out a better KM practice in the department, With these strategies objectives and technical issue implemented the maturity level will be raised from initial stage of 1 to defined stage of 3 respectively.

There are many ways to improve KM practice, after considering various constraints like manpower, budget, and technical support level within the department, some recommendations are made. 

===KM strategies===

The department relies on face to face conversation, which belongs to tacit to tacit knowledge transfer, heavily. However, tacit knowledge is difficult to formalize and communicate, and even many of them were being reinvented or lost in the transition. Besides, the department was facing ineffective knowledge sharing to the external (e.g. students). The objectives of the recommended strategy should be:

:#Balancing the focus on more tacit to explicit knowledge transfer
:#Minimizing the overhead on tacit knowledge transfer
:#Establishing project cases and best practices for future reference (by After Action Reviews)
:#Implementing coaching and mentoring programmes
:#Establishing knowledge mapping and Communities of practice (CoP) for external events archive

===KM Technologies===

:'''Project team site'''
:For objective I, II, III and IV the department may consider use project team site (e.g. Google Site, MediaWiki) as a tool to formalize the KM activities (e.g. knowledge creation, capture) in the department. As Skyrme suggested people tend to recall knowledge better when it is received in the form of storytelling (2001), a project case is suggested as a learning tool for new staff. In order to capture the entire picture of the project, all the three type of projects (Seminars, Field Trips, Workshops) should be included.  As the program natures are different, each of them should have an individual team site for future reference. Each project team site should consist of some formalized components: project announcements, project calendar, project details (project proposal, milestone, checklist, etc.), best practice, after action review and updates. The PIC (person-in-charge) is responsible for updating the team site for their projects.

:The project team sites offer standard structures of how to record the knowledge in a project. All the project details should be captured on the project site to ensure the accuracy of knowledge shared and avoid duplication of records. The project team site will act as a storytelling object and the reference for After Action Reviews, which is a learning process for participant to discover the problems in the project and discuss the related solution. The solutions generated can be displayed in the form of Frequently Asked Question(FAQ), which can  refine the best practice for future reference (Skyrme, 2001). After the reviews, the best practice will be updated according to needs, so new staffs can learn the procedures through best practice and can look for the details in project cases. Best practices make use of roles and responsibilities to clearly identify the knowledge that need to be obtained when it is in certain role and training. Information should be limited to the maximum efficiency of accessing and learning the knowledge.

:'''Knowledge mapping and Community of Practice'''
:For the external knowledge dissemination, the department may consider using knowledge mapping and conducting virtual Community of Practice (CoP) for enhance the integrated knowledge space in the university. Wexler (2001) describes knowledge mapping is a new communication channel using graphical presentation of ideas, topics and stories between map creators and map users. What’s more, knowledge maps collect and organize explicit knowledge and present the relationship between different knowledge. In order to facilitate the knowledge dissemination to students, the department is suggested to apply knowledge mapping for students to study according to topics and relations. Students can choose their favorite topic and follow the study path in the knowledge map.

===Culture===

The experience of the department is relatively young that it is good for implementing KM, because people are more willing to share their knowledge when everyone is new and still in the learning stage. It is suggested that the department should provide more guides of the technologies adapted to the staff, as they will be more willing to practice knowledge management when they are more familiar with the technologies (Tikhomirov, Tikhomirova, Maksimova &amp; Telnov, 2009).

==Limitations and Conclusion==

The department has long been developed a sharing culture, and it provided a strong foundation for KM development in the future. The staff recognized KM is an important element for long term success. However, it can be discovered that the department has no idea on what should be captured and how the captured knowledge can be disseminated more effectively. In the case study, the integrated KM cycle was applied to investigate the KM development of the department. '''See Figure 2'''



Together with the G-KMMM assessment, we structured a comprehensive view of the department’s KM implementation level. The integrated KM cycle, KM metrics and G-KMMM, as a framework of investigation, help us identify the key areas that need to be improved in different aspects of view. 

The case study also implicated the KPAs (People, Process and Technology) worked as the principle of KM practices. All of the KPAs are co-related with each other and facilitate the KM activities to run smoother. Refer to Collison and Parcell suggestion (2004); knowledge management should be embedded in core processes. As demonstrated in the finding, the department seemed to neglect the importance of integrating their KM practices into their core routine tasks.

In the case study, we used interview for our primary research reference. There are times that interviewees might get out of track to our discussion and additional guidance had to be made in order to help the interviewees grasp the idea of the questions. In addition, more quantitative data should be collected by other survey methods (e.g. questionnaire) for double validation of the result.

&quot;KM Teams&quot; in the Integrated KM Cycle is intentionally omitted in our analysis. KM Teams refers to the KM professionals who work on a team and perform knowledge management in a firm. As quoted by A. A. Hodg (1823 -1886), these professionals should be the one “who knows the sources of knowledge—where it is written and where it is to be found.” However, due to the size of the department, it is not feasible for it to recruit any specialist in KM to implement KM and so KM Teams is not in our scope of study. Yet, as the department grows in size, there may be needs for setting up KM Team in the future and it leaves further investigation in the future.

For the future challenges in KM for the development, it can be foreseen that the KM practices were easily be isolated from organization goals.  The new KM practices should put effort to enhance the organization competence by improving the organization creativity in organizing events.

Despite the current limitation, the case study demonstrated how the department was investigated by different diagnostic tools and what could be improved for the department in order to reach higher KM maturity level. However, the actual performance of KM could not be evaluated. As stated by Dalkir (2005), organization should quantify and qualify the result of KM performance (e.g. creativity). To recommend further study, we suggest more focus should be put on how KM can actually improve the organization performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Video Surveillance===
Surveillance systems are becoming a popular security feature in public places, schools, businesses and even at home.  Simply having a video surveillance system that is visible to the public can act as a deterrent.  Commonly seen video surveillance systems are in gas stations, fast food restaurants and banks.  There are a wide range of video surveillance systems with an array of features and they vary drastically in cost.  These systems typically record “real-time” or for review at a later time, some also have the ability to record audio.  Video surveillance is a rapidly growing area of technology and there is a type of surveillance system to meet the needs of almost everyone.
 http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-video-surveillance-systems.htm

Video surveillance is used at many stores, buildings and facilities where they need extra security. Video surveillance is also been added to subways, streets, airports, etc. The cameras are located and attatched to posts, or a building and can used to identify criminals, and crime. Camera phones are also becoming extremely popular in being used as a security feature. Cell phones are also being used in a negative way, which is why many facilities, ban the use of cell phones all together. Many facilities like to protect the privacy of their customers and client’s privacy by not allowing cell phones, video usage, or pictures to be taken. Camera phones are also being banned in schools to prevent cheating.

These Video Surveillance cameras are basically located outside and attached to or built to the wall unit; just as the lamp posts or they are sometimes even attached to buildings. Nowadays, video surveillance cameras are used in schools so that administrators can monitor the activities of both teachers and students and have to record any disturbing incidents that can happen between students. On the other hand, when Video Surveillance cameras are attached in public places they even have face recognition technology to try to identify any known culprits or suspicious person or even to identify the criminals if any crime has been caught on tape, and furthermore to prevent any crimes from occurring.

'''Closed-Circuit Television'''[[File:Axis 214 PTZ Camera.jpg |right| thumb | An example of a surveillance camera which can be remotely operated. These types of cameras can be found anywhere and are becoming increasingly more common.]]
Closed-Circuit Television or CCTV is the use of a video camera or multiple video cameras which broadcast their feed to a specific location and that feed is not accessible by anyone outside that specific location. CCTV can be found in most stores and most public public buildings, such as schools and hospitals. There are CCTV products for sale that allows an individual to purchase them and set them up around their property and then they can log onto the internet and log onto their cameras and view the feed from anywhere in the world. Some of the cameras are even capable of being controlled online so that you can move them around while being thousands of miles away.

==Employee Monitoring==

Some or most employers are using monitoring software to see what their employees are doing throughout the day or week. Some companies state in their company handout that they may choose to monitor the activity of employees of theirs. They do own the equipment. This practice has been going on for quite some time. They can listen to your phones calls, private or business. They can check to see where you have been on the internet. Some companies block certain websites such as: gaming, social networks, porn and personal e-mailing. This to me seems that they want to eleviate too much socializing on computers during our work day. They also have software that can tell you how many keystrokes a person is using, people who do a lot of data entry or preforming a high amount of keystrokes. They could also tell how long your computer has been idle; meaning you may be away from your desk for long periods of time. They will just keep monitoring you and say nothing until it is time for your performance review. We all know the we shouldn't be using computers at work for our own enjoyment but how many people do it? Is anyone monitoring the monitors. I think if you don't use it to the extreme it should be ok, but that is company time unless you are on lunch.

People that work for the government or company that provides cell phones have a right to monitor the usage of those devices. These devices are given to workers to help them perform your duties. There are also tracking devices which some employees use to keep up with their drivers. I bet you didn't know that companies can also monitor and even open your mail even if it's against the law. We are constantly being monitored in some way, either at work or outside. Survelliance and monitoring are used intensively in retail and marketing stores to deter theft. Currently there are few laws regulating employee monitoring. There are several groups that are actively involved in workplace monitoring issues and that advocate stronger government regulation of employee monitoring activities.</text>

== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Durable_goods&amp;diff=2313377&amp;oldid=2312700 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* ''Definition of &quot;Durable Goods&quot;'' and ''Durable vs. Non Durable''--These are trying to get at the same thing. They should be merged, and the section title removed, which will make that section the &quot;introduction&quot; to this page.
* ''Tone''--There's no need to sell the advantages of durable goods. A sandwich is not a durable good, but I might still prefer one to a pen.
* ''&quot;They should be thought of in terms of the course of services provided over time by the good rather than the physical good itself&quot;''--This is important, and should continue to be highlighted, perhaps as its own section of the page.
* ''&quot;Due to the fact that time is one of the main concerns when dealing with durable goods it is important to use ceteris paribus (keep all other things held constant) when considering the subject matter.''&quot;--&quot;ceteris paribus&quot; is used throughout economic analysis, so I'm not sure what you're aiming for with this, but maybe remove it from this section and put it back somewhere where it's more clearly being used?
* ''Costs''--Much of the second paragraph talks about the costs to make goods durable. This is part of the standard analysis of durable goods, but doesn't fit with our focus for information goods. My suggestion would be:
*# Makes &quot;costs&quot; its own section
*# Mention ''briefly'' that much durable goods analysis highlights the cost difference to make goods durable.
*# Then go on to point out that this isn't the case (at least not in the same way) for information goods.
* ''&quot;An example of a non durable good would be a water bottle.''&quot;--I reuse water bottles. Perhaps go for something completely non-durable like a food item (also these examples fit better up in the introduction).
* ''Current Role of Durable Goods in the Economy''--There are two problems with this section:
*# It's very timely, which would be good in a lot of reports, but isn't appropriate for a textbook. We would hope someone could get just as much out of this if they read it 6 years from now.
*# It's not about information goods, but about other kinds of durable goods, so gets away from the focus of this book.
** So, I expect this section should get pulled out. This does point out an interesting statistical thing, however, which is how &quot;durable goods&quot; are defined in government statistics. You'll need to find the references, but as I recall, most information goods are not formally classified as &quot;durable goods&quot;, except for some things like business software. Talking about that would be a good addition.
* ''&quot;An even better example of an information durable good is an online website.''&quot;--A web site is generally not a durable good. If I download it to my computer, it may be a durable good, but if it's on the web site, it's more of a service, the web site owner can remove it at any time.
* ''&quot;One important thing to note about durable information goods is that their value may deteriorate, but the information is still durable.''&quot;--This is something that would be worth elaborating on. For instance, you could look at the depreciation rate for business software. It can technically last for decades, but the typical use is more like 2-5 years (before updating to a new version).
* ''Damage of Piracy and Resale in the Video Game Market''
** I provided a link to a Slashdot article, but that's not a good enough reference in itself. It was just a place for inspiration. You need to find better references, which you might be able to get by following links in that Slashdot article (or maybe you'll have to search elsewhere).
** Software piracy and resale are two different things, which should be treated separately. I'd probably leave piracy off this page entirely, since there's [[Strategy for Information Markets/Piracy|a separate page on piracy]].
** You should address the [[w:doctrine of first sale|doctrine of first sale]] and how it fits with resale (and rental) of copyrighted material.
** You could talk about DVD rental--because of the state of U.S. law it is note generally legal to rent music recordings but is generally legal to rent video recordings. Thus, the video rental business. When a business like NetFlix rents DVD's, they don't have to get permission from or pay the copyright holders. However, if they stream videos, they do need to negotiate deals with the copyright holders.
** There are legal issues with whether someone &quot;owns a copy&quot; of a piece of software or merely is &quot;licensed&quot; a copy. Software companies argue that if they license a piece of software, the consumer is not allowed to resell it.
** The textbook talks a lot about durable goods and resale, including formal models and pictures. While the cost part of the durable goods thing is not so useful to us, the models of resale are.
** Mention (briefly, since there's another section on it) &quot;software as a service&quot; (SaaS) because that is taking something we're used to thinking of as a durable good which could be re-sold and turning it into a service (which is non-durable and can't be re-sold).
* ''Importance of Durable Goods''--This section is fuzzy right now, and should be merged into some stuff above.
* ''References''--The reference to businessweek would be good if the material were more appropriate to the article. The reference to Slashdot needs to be replaced with something better. Otherwise, this page is in desperate need of references.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Digital Counterfeiting==
In definition '''digital counterfeiting''' is the use of computers or digital equipment to make counterfeit copies of printed resources.  The major example of counterfeits is currency which according to the U.S. Secret Service around 60% of currency made counterfeit is done so digitally.  Other counterfeit items also include business checks, collectibles, fake identifications, and credit cards.  The practice of counterfeiting is illegal in the United States and offenders could be sentenced to 15 years per offense.  The majority of counterfeit currency are produced by gangs, organized crime, and terrorist organizations but has also been seen done so by college students and even high school students.  Although easily detectable counterfeit currency has had more ease of creating due to more and more digital technology that allows to do so. [[File:New_five_dollar_bill.jpg|thumb|US Currency]]

In order to prevent currency counterfeiting, the Government has been implementing measures such as changing the currency design every 7 to 10 years. With each new edition they are incorporating additional security features (watermarks, microprinting)which make it hard to duplicate the bills and can be easily seen when holding the bills up to the light. 
Also, in order to make it easier to track the source of the counterfeit item, the digital imaging equipment(copiers, scanners)are equipped with technologies such as printing invisible code that make tracking possible.Cannon has revealed to be using such technologies since 1992.

===Digital Watermark===
The use of digital watermarks is incredibly popular and most often people have no idea when something actually has a digital watermark.  Digital watermarks are used to identify whether or not a document has been tampered with, protect sensitive material from unauthorized editing and to deter things like counterfeiting and piracy.  The process of digital watermarking involves embedding digital information or identifiers into audio, video and printed materials.  The digital watermark, while undetectable to people can easily be identified and analyzed by computers.

===Security Thread===
One digital counterfeiting prevention tool is a security thread.  A security thread is a plastic strip that is embedded in U.S. currency. This strip can only be seen when it is held up to the light or when placed under an ultraviolet light. When you make the strip visible, it shows the letters USA followed by a number. The number is the value of the bill. For example a one dollar bill will have &quot;USA 1&quot; printed on the security thread.  This feature makes currency hard to duplicate but not impossible. Some counterfeits have been known to have a thin grey line printed on the end of the thread or a varnish at the end.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Employee Monitoring refers to companies recording or observing the actions of employees while on the job. It is very easy to perform, and much of it can be done through the use of computers. Common employee monitoring activities include screening telephone calls, reviewing e-mail, and tracking computer and internet usage. With the growing inclusion of video cameras in computers and monitors, employee monitoring via PC may become more prominent in the near future. Although many employees find it is an invasion of privacy, it is legal and very common in the U.S. For monitoring physical locations of employees, video cameras can be used, but another possibility is the use of smart or RFID- enabled ID cards (sometimes called proximity cards).

When you think about employee monitoring I think that most employees would agree that they are not a fan of this.  Unfortunately in our society today, employee monitoring, has become a necessary action for employers to take.  Because of all of the things that are available when accessing the internet, computer monitoring is a must.  Monitoring an employee’s use of the internet on a company owned computer is done by the majority of employers, because an employee can pay bills, shop, read all types of media and also use all of the social networking sites while in the workplace.  An employer could block the internet from an employee’s computer, but that is not always possible, as the internet might be needed to accomplish their job

Employee monitoring is very common in today’s business world. Employee monitoring reduces risk of theft, injury, and other problems that occur daily in the workplace. Employee monitoring is not illegal, it is actually recommended. Telephones, computer terminals, voice mail, or any Internet accessible device can be monitored. This is because every Internet activity leaves a '''digital footprint''' that can be traced. However, limitations have been placed on accessing personal accounts. According to Stengart v. LovingCare Agency, Inc. an agency cannot access an employee’s personal password protected account. Even if deleted from the terminal, messages still remain in memory “backed up” on magnetic tape. Encryption is the safest way to achieve legitimate privacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rights and Bibliographic Data ==

Defining rights to bibliographic data is a complicated matter. The rights to a particular record vary according to the originating institution, their description level, and other factors. Records created by employees of the Library of Congress as part of their official duties, for instance, are in the public domain. Other libraries, however, retain rights to certain bibliographic data. Several libraries, including a number of national European libraries, have opted to explicitly waive their rights to catalog data using the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0). These libraries include the [http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/British_Library British Library] (2011), [http://de.creativecommons.org/2012/01/27/normdaten-deutsche-nationalbibliothek-kundigt-umstellung-auf-cc0-an/ Deutsche Nationalbibliothek] (2012), and the [http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/National_Library_of_Spain National Library of Spain] (2012); as well as [http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/harvard-releases-big-data-for-books/ Harvard University] (2012), the [http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/University_of_Florida_Library University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries], and [http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/CERN CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research Library] (both 2011).

At the core of any bibliographic record is purely descriptive metadata: a document's title, author, place of publication, physical dimensions, etc. In 1991, the U.S. Supreme Court established that information alone, without some minimum of original creativity, cannot be protected by copyright (Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340). Therefore, purely descriptive catalog records, like minimal vendor records and many fiction records, are likely not protected by copyright, no matter what which institution created them. Bibliographic records denoting the aboutness of a particular document -- those including subject headings, notes, and the like -- are eligible for copyright, but few libraries opt to explicitly claim copyright. Finally, as more OPACs are allowing library users to add tags, reviews, and other metadata to catalog records, things get even trickier. While Web 2.0 social cataloging websites, such as LibraryThing and Goodreads, have clearly defined terms and guidelines explaining the rights of both parties to user-submitted bibliographic data, most library catalogs have not explicitly identified such rights.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Employee Monitoring==
Some or most employers are using monitoring software to see what their employees are doing throughout the day or week. Some companies state in their company handout that they may choose to monitor the activity of employees of theirs. They do own the equipment. This practice has been going on for quite some time. They can listen to your phones calls, private or business. They can check to see where you have been on the internet. Some companies block certain websites such as: gaming, social networks, porn and personal e-mailing. This to me seems that they want to eleviate too much socializing on computers during our work day. They also have software that can tell you how many keystrokes a person is using, people who do a lot of data entry or preforming a high amount of keystrokes. They could also tell how long your computer has been idle; meaning you may be away from your desk for long periods of time. They will just keep monitoring you and say nothing until it is time for your performance review. We all know the we shouldn't be using computers at work for our own enjoyment but how many people do it? Is anyone monitoring the monitors. I think if you don't use it to the extreme it should be ok, but that is company time unless you are on lunch.
People that work for the government or company that provides cell phones have a right to monitor the usage of those devices. These devices are given to workers to help them perform your duties. There are also tracking devices which some employees use to keep up with their drivers. I bet you didn't know that companies can also monitor and even open your mail even if it's against the law. We are constantly being monitored in some way, either at work or outside. Survelliance and monitoring are used intensively in retail and marketing stores to deter theft. Currently there are few laws regulating employee monitoring. There are several groups that are actively involved in workplace monitoring issues and that advocate stronger government regulation of employee monitoring activities.
Computer monitoring software that can record an individual’s computer use is viewed as a privacy violation by some, as is the increased use of video surveillancein public locations. Although it is allowed by law, some employees view employee monitoring(such as monitoring computer use, telephone calls, and an individual’s location using a smart ID card or video surveillance) as an invasion of their privacy. Presence technology—  the ability of one computer on a network to know the status of another computer on that network—allows users of computers, mobile phones, and other communications devices to determine the availability of other individuals before contacting them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Green Computing ====
Green computing refers to making computers and their production more environmentally friendly. The U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the ENERGY STAR program; if hardware is ENERGY STAR compliant it displays the ENERGY STAR label. ENERGY STAR focuses on efficiency while devices are being used; as well as power management features that can put the device into sleep or hibernation mode after a set amount of time of not being used. &lt;ref&gt;Morley, Deborah, and Charles S. Parker. &quot;Chapter 16.&quot; Understanding Computers: Today and Tomorrow. 13th ed. Boston, MA: Course Technology, Cengage Learning, 2011. 666. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy Consumption and Conservation ===
Today, because our computers are faster and more powerful than computers of old, the energy consumption and heat generation associated are higher than ever. Coupled with the high cost of energy, businesses are trying to find ways to reduce costs and energy consumption. A common energy saving tactic is the consolidation of servers. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is also in the process of developing an energy performance rating system for data centers. Hardware manufacturers are developing energy efficient computers and components and energy-saving features. Because computers can consume a fair amount of energy despite in standby and sleep mode, businesses and schools are progressively using software to automatically shut down computers when not in use. Devices that draw power when turned off, (referred to as energy vampires) include computers, home electronics, and home appliances. It is estimated that the average U.S. household can save an average of $100 just by unplugging devices when you are not using them.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= The Demo Database =
GNU Health default installation comes with no data. It's interesting, for academic and training purposes to have some demo data that exemplifies concepts and improves the learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;
The demo database is an ongoing project and it will be adapting to the each new GNU Health version. The clinical history will also grow with time.

For consistency sake, it's important to have the main characters information constant (family members name, birth dates and place, health centers, family doctors ... ). The information and characters are fictitious and we should try to make it valid for different cultures.

== The Zenon-Betz Family ==

The story goes around the Betz family, and the main character, &quot;Ana Betz&quot;, a primary school teacher. 

* Health Center : GNU Solidario Hospital in Las Palmas, Spain 
* Family Doctor : Cameron Cordara. ID : 765870 . Speciality : Family Medicine . Insitution : GNU Solidario Hospital

* Family : Zenon-Betz family : John Zenon (SSN : 40556644 ),  Ana Betz and their son, Matt (SSN : 97234436 ).
* Ana : The main character. Born October 4th, 1985 .&lt;br /&gt;


'''Demographics Information'''
* Social Security Number : 55567890 
* Sex : Female. 
* Marital Status : Married
* Profession : School teacher.
* Education Level : University

* Domiciliary Unit  
** Housing Conditions :Comfortable and good sanitary conditions


'''Patient Information'''

* Socio-Economic Status :Middle class
* Allergies : β-lactam hypersensitivity
* Diseases : Type 1 Diabetes diagnosed on November 10th 1993 .
* Medication : Insulin since November 10th 1993
* Genetic Information
** Family history  
*** Maternal Grandfather : Marfan's Syndrome ( Q87.4 )
*** Father : Essential (primary) hypertension ( I10 )
** Disease Genes 
*** BRCA1:breast cancer 1, early onset

* Obstetric Information : G1P1A0
** Newborn : Matt. DoB : March 15th 2010 . Epidural, vaginal birth. 

* Lifestyle  
** Ex-smoker
** Addictions : No recreational drugs 
** Sexuality : Heterosexual; Monogamous and practices safe sex. 
** Safety : Motorcycle rider. Uses helmet
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Other Information'''

* Family information (Family functionality level, members, operational sectors... )
* Imaging ( X-rays, CTs, MRIs.. )
* Genetic info / risks
* Surgeries
* Lab orders and results
* Clinical history of the family
&lt;br /&gt;

== The online Demo Database ==

We have a community server available in the Internet so you can connect and try the latest GNU Health .
&lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;/br&gt;
First, you need to download and install the Tryton client application, according to your operating system&lt;/br&gt; 
[http://downloads2.tryton.org/3.0/tryton-3.0.2.tar.gz GNU/Linux]&lt;/br&gt;
[http://downloads2.tryton.org/3.0/tryton-setup-3.0.2.exe Windows]&lt;/br&gt;
[http://downloads.tryton.org/3.0/tryton-last.dmg MacOS X]
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Then you have to set the correct tabs position:
[[GNU_Health/Installation#Setting_the_Tryton_client_Tabs_position_for_GNU_Health|Setting the Tryton client Tabs position for GNU Health]]
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Finally you can login using the following information:&lt;/br&gt;

'''Server''': health.gnusolidario.org:8000&lt;/br&gt; 
'''Database''': health24&lt;/br&gt; 
'''User name''': admin&lt;/br&gt; 
'''Password''': gnusolidario

== Installing a local Demo Database ==

We use the '''proteus''' engine to install the demo database.

First we need to install proteus in your local environment

 $ pip install --user proteus

'''Alternatively''', and if you're using any Debian GNU/Linux system, you can also install proteus from a repository. 

 $ apt-get install tryton-proteus

'''Warning''', do not install proteus using pip and then apt-get as well. Most likely difference version of proteus will be installed and the demo database installation will fail.

Now, look for the demo directory. You can run the script from anywhere, but make sure your tryton libraries are in the python search  path. This is important, specially if you use the manual installation. 

 $ export PYTHONPATH=&quot;&lt;PLACE_OF_YOUR_TRYTON_SERVER_DIRECTORY&gt;&quot;

So, for example, if you installed the GNU Health sever with the standard method, then your variable declaration for PYTHONPATH for Tryton 3.0.3 would be something like :

 $ export PYTHONPATH=&quot;/home/gnuhealth/gnuhealth/tryton/server/trytond-3.0.3/&quot;

Next, run the script :

 $ cd &lt;demo_directory&gt;
 $ python health_demo_server.py

So, for example, if you installed the GNU Health sever with the standard method, the demo directory would ~/gnuhealth-2.4.1/scripts/demo (or whatever version number yours is) and you use:

 $ cd ~/gnuhealth-2.4.1/scripts/demo
 $ python health_demo_server.py

This script will create a new database called '''gnuhealth_demo''' with the demo information. Be patient, it can take some time.

User name: admin&lt;/br&gt; 
Password: admin

Sen dudaga gidecek, kara üzüm.
Yalnizca benim dudaklarimda ol
Ellerim ellerini tutmak
Gözlerim gözlerine bakmak.
Kalbim seni ister.
Ben neyleyim bir garip hamal
Sevenleri tasirim.
Tasirim böyle güzeli seven
Garipleri tasirim.

=Convergence=
&quot; ... methods of acceleration of convergence. Suppose you have a slowly convergent series, and want to know its sum (numerically). Just by summing x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_{1000} + ... x_{1000000} + ... + x_{1000000000} + ... you will get the required accuracy after 100 years. If you fit your x_n to c_2/n^2 + c_3/n^3 + (a few more terms), you will get the same accuracy of the sum in 1 second.&quot;  Andrey (theoretical high energy physicist) &lt;ref&gt;[http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.maxima.general/38571 limit of series at gmane.org discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;

* implement higher precision arithmetic than your hardware natively supports
**software emulation ( emulating a double with two floats, fixed points numbers , ...)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thasler.org/blog/?p=143#more-143 Heavy computing with GLSL – Part 5: Emulated quadruple precision by Henry Thasler]&lt;/ref&gt;
* use algorithms that are more numerically stable 

==How many decimal digits are there in n bits ? ==
One digit of binary number needs one bit : there are 2 binary digits ( 0 and 1) and bit have 2 states.
One digit of decimal number needs aproximately 3.4 bits. &lt;ref&gt;[http://beej.us/blog/data/pi-chudnovsky-gmp/ Computing π with Chudnovsky and GMP by Beej Jorgensen]&lt;/ref&gt;There are 10 decimal numbers, 3 bits have 8 states which is not enoughl, 4 bits have 16 states which is too much.

==External rays ==
===Parameter rays===
'''The Wolf Jung test''' : 
The external parameter rays for angles  (in turns)
* 1/7 (period 3) 
* 321685687669320/2251799813685247 (period 51)
* 321685687669322/2251799813685247 ( period 51 )
Angles differ by about &lt;math&gt;10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt;, but the landing points of the corresponding parameter rays are about 0.035 apart. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mndynamics.com/indexp.html Wolf Jung's test for precision of drawing parameter rays]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic rays===
====number type====

====angle precision====
For rotational number ( internal angle) 1/34 ray for external angle : 

&lt;math&gt;t_a =\frac{2^{33}}{2^{34}-1} =\frac{8589934592}{17179869183} = 0.5000000000291038 &lt;/math&gt;

lands on the alfa fixed point :

&lt;math&gt;z_a = 0.491486549841951  +0.091874758908285i &lt;/math&gt;

It is not a ray for angle :

&lt;math&gt;t_b =\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 &lt;/math&gt;

which land on the point :&lt;ref&gt;One can find it using program Mandel by Wolf Jung using Ray to point menu position ( or Y key) &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;z_b = -0.508513450158049  +0.091874758908285i&lt;/math&gt;


Difference between external angles of the rays is :

&lt;math&gt;dt = t_b - t_a =-0.0000000000291038  &lt;/math&gt;

and between landing points of the rays points is :
&lt;pre&gt;
/* Maxima CAS code */
(%i1) za:0.491486549841951  +0.091874758908285*%i;

Milnor]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Julia set z+z^5.png|thumbnail|right|Julia set z+z^5. Image and src code]]
Comment by  Mark McClure : &lt;ref&gt;[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/361205/what-is-the-shape-of-parabolic-critical-orbit math.stackexchange  questions : what-is-the-shape-of-parabolic-critical-orbit]&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot; an escape time algorithm would take forever to generate that type of image, since the dynamics are so slow there. If you want resolution of 1/100, it would take roughly 2108 iterates to move the point z0=0.01 to z=2 by iterating f(z)=z+z5 &quot;
===Cases ===
====Nonparabolic case====

Lets take simple hyperbolic case where parameter c is : 

 &lt;math&gt;c= 0&lt;/math&gt;

Here repelling fixed point z_f is :
 &lt;math&gt;z_f = 1 &lt;/math&gt;


====Parabolic case====

Lets take simple [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/parabolic|parabolic case]] where parameter c is : &lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0505036 Parabolic Julia Sets are Polynomial Time Computable by Mark Braverman]&lt;/ref&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;c= \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

Here parabolic fixed point z_f is :
 &lt;math&gt;z_f = \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

===Test ===

Lets take point z of exterior of Julia set but lying near fixed point :

 &lt;math&gt;distance = 2^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;
 
 &lt;math&gt;z = z_f + distance&lt;/math&gt;

where n is a positive integer 
 

Check how many iterates i needs point z to reach target set ( = escape)  :

 &lt;math&gt;|z_i| &gt; ER&lt;/math&gt;

where ER is [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Escape_radius_.28_ER.29|Escape Radius]]


Show relationship between :
*  n
* Last Iteration
* type of numbers used for computations ( float, double, long double, extended, arbitrary precision )

===Analysis ===

'''Maximal n''' in hyperbolic case &lt;math&gt;n =  n_h &lt;/math&gt; is allmost the same as the precision of the significand &lt;ref&gt;[[:w:Floating_point#IEEE_754:_floating_point_in_modern_computers|wikipedia :Floating point , EEE_754]]&lt;/ref&gt;

 &lt;math&gt; n_h = precision - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

In parabolic case maximal  &lt;math&gt;n =  n_p &lt;/math&gt; is

 &lt;math&gt; n_p = \frac{precision}{2}  &lt;/math&gt;

'''Last Iteration''' ( escape time = iteration fro which abs(zn) &gt; ER ) is : 
in hyperbolic case equal to n :
 
 &lt;math&gt; LI_h = n &lt;/math&gt;

in parabolic case equal to 2^n : 

 &lt;math&gt; LI _p = 2^n &lt;/math&gt;

'''Time of computations''' is proportional to number of iterations. In hyperbolic case is is short. In parabolic case grows quickly as number of iterations. 

 &lt;math&gt; time [seconds] = 6 * 2^{n-24} &lt;/math&gt;

Checking one point if escapes in parabolic case : 
* for n = 34 take about one hour ( 5 595 seconds )
* for n = 40 take about one day 
* for n = 45 take about one month
* for n = 50 take about one year

===Q&amp;A===

==== Why programs fails ? ====

Cancellation of significant digits&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Significant figures|wikipedia : Significant figures]]&lt;/ref&gt; and loss of significance (LOS).&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Loss of significance|wikipedia  : Loss of significance]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_math.html IEEE Arithmetic from Numerical Computation Guide by Oracle]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program fails because of limited precision of used number types. Addition of big (zp) and small number (distance) gives number which has more decimal digits then can be saved  ( floating point type has only 7 decimal digits). Some of the most right digits are cancelled and iteration goes into an infinite loop. 

For example : when using floating point in parabolic case lets take 

 float cx = 0.25;
 float Zpx = 0.5;
 float Zx ;
 float distance;
 float Zx2;
 float n = 13;

so 
 
 distance = pow(2.0,-n); // = 1.2207031250e-04 = 0,00012207

It is greater then machine epsilon&lt;ref&gt;[[:w:Machine_epsilon|Machine epsilon]]&lt;/ref&gt; :

 distance &gt; FLT_EPSILON // = pow(2, -24) = 5.96e-08 = 0,00000006

so this addition still works :

 Zx = Zpx + distance; // adding big and small number gives 0,50012207

After multiplication it gives :

 Zx2 = Zx*Zx; // = 0,250122

next step is addition. Because floating point format saves only 7 decimal digits it is truncated to :

 Zx = Zx2 + cx; // = 0,500122 = Zp + (distance/2)
 
Here relative error is to big and 
 d2= 0.0000000149 // distance*distance
is smaller then FLT_EPSILON/2.0 = 0.0000000596; 

Solution : increase precision !

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The common law provides for a defence of necessity for &quot;emergency situations where normal human instincts, whether self-preservation or of altruism, overwhelmingly impels disobedience.&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Perka, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232&lt;/ref&gt; The defence provides a legal excuse (as opposed to a justification) for conduct making out the offence.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Perka, [1984] 2 SCR 232&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence is to be &quot;strictly controlled and scrupulously limited&quot; to situations of true involuntariness.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Perka, [1984] 2 SCR 232&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Latimer, 2001 SCC 1, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 26 to 34
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The elements to make out the defence of necessity:
# the accused  must be in imminent peril or danger&lt;ref&gt; See Morgentaler v. The Queen, 1975 CanLII 8, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 616, at p. 678&lt;/ref&gt;
# the accused  must have had no reasonable legal alternative to the course of action he  or she undertook
# the harm inflicted by the accused must be  proportional to the harm avoided by the accused

The peril or danger must be more than just foreseeable or likely. It must be near and unavoidable. At the least, &quot;the  situation must be so emergent and the peril must be so pressing that  normal human instincts cry out for action and make a counsel of patience  unreasonable.&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;R v Perka, [1984] 2 SCR 232&lt;/ref&gt;

To be proportional, the harm avoided must be at least comparable to the  harm inflicted.

The elements of imminent peril and no alternative is determined on a modified objective standard taking into account the situation and characteristics of the accused.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Latimer, [http://canlii.ca/t/523c 2001 SCC 1], [2001] 1 SCR 3 at 32 to 34&lt;/ref&gt; The element of proportionality is measured on an objective standard.

The defences first set out in R v Latimer, however, had previously been considered as potentially available in the case of Morgentaler v. The Queen, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 616.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The defence of &quot;non-insane automatism&quot; is a defence available at common law. 

Automatism is the &quot;involuntary behaviour, the state of a person who, though capable of action is not conscious of what he is doing. It means an unconscious involuntary act where the mind does not go with what is being done.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Rabey (1977) 37 C.C.C. 2d 461 at 155 &lt;/ref&gt; It is a state of consciousness where the persons is capable of action, but has not voluntary control over the action.&lt;ref&gt;Rabey at 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden is on the accused to prove involuntariness on a balance of probabilities.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Stone at 179 (“The foregoing leads me to the conclusion that the legal burden in cases involving claims of automatism must be on the defence to prove involuntariness on a balance of probabilities to the trier of fact.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC right}}

Most locations off the Earth do not have automatic recycling of waste products, and a space project will have a finite amount of materials that have been processed beyond the raw state.  We define '''Recycling''' as the application of energy and processes to convert materials from a non-useful state back to a useful state.  It shares some technology with production from raw materials, except using materials that have already been processed previously and are not in their raw state. In fact some recycling methods will involve feeding waste products back into a production process.

===Waste Recycling=== 

A goal for recycling is to achieve '''Closure''', where all waste products are converted back to useful states and the only external input is energy.  We expect this to be a theoretical limit similar to conversion efficiency in electrical transformers and motors.  Those devices can reach 98% efficiency but not 100%.  Similarly, practical recycling is expected to reach a high percentage, but not 100%.  To the extent your percent closure CL% approaches 100, the amount of new raw materials required is reduced to 100-CL% of an open system with no recycling. So a high percent closure can have a dramatic effect on the need for new raw material processing or replacement items brought from elsewhere.

Some items by their nature are not amenable to recycling.  A prominent example is reaction mass expelled outside a gravity well by a propulsion method.  You are deliberately throwing that mass away in order to get thrust, and outside a gravity well there is no practical way to recover it to use it again.  Within a gravity well, such as launching from Earth using a chemical rocket, all the reaction mass is sub-orbital - ranging from about -1/2 orbital velocity to +1/2 orbital velocity depending on the vehicle velocity.  Therefore it all ends up back on Earth and can be used again.  While some reaction mass cannot be recovered, you can deliberately choose high efficiency methods that lose less mass this way, and use methods such as gravity assist that do not lose propellant mass.

===Closed Loop Life Support===

Humans are biological organisms with certain requirements to continue living, including clean air, water, and sufficient food.  They also produce waste products from the human standpoint, such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, urine, and feces.  On Earth those wastes from the human standpoint are necessary inputs to plants and other organisms, and solar powered evaporation produces clean water in the form of rain.  The natural cycles form closed loops.  For space projects we have to replicate the function of those closed loops with artificial systems, or supply air, water, and food from external sources.  The more time and the higher the number of humans the greater the outside supply mass becomes, and so the more desirable a closed loop system becomes.

Besides inputs such as air, food, and water, humans additionally need controlled lighting, temperature, pressure, radiation levels, and acceleration. Prepared food and feces are complex from a chemical standpoint, there are secondary volatiles and shed skin produced by humans, and body and clothing cleaning are desirable.  Therefore a full life support system for humans is complex.  We apply the Systems Engineering approach of dividing it into simpler sub-systems that each perform part of the total functions required, and then optimize the full system as a whole.  In addition to the direct functions that provide life support, such as growing plants producing food, there are also indirect functions caused by meeting the requirements of the plants, such as water, illumination, gravity, and C0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration.  The methods listed below include meeting both direct and indirect functions.

====Artificial Gravity====

Humans and plants are evolved in a 1 g environment.  Without gravity, human bones deteriorate and some plants may not grow properly.  With gravity, water circulation and dust settling operate by familiar methods.  If local gravity from a large satellite or planet is not sufficient, artificial acceleration can be generated by rotation.

====Illumination====

Photosynthetic plants need sufficient illumination of the right wavelengths to grow, and humans need sufficient light to see and navigate.  Having both evolved on Earth with the Sun as the main source of illumination, both use the wavelength band that the Sun emits the most power at, known as '''Visible Light'''. There are slight differences in intensity, day cycle, and wavelengths for various plants, and for what humans need to see properly. Natural sunlight is easily obtained at many locations in space, so it certainly should be considered if available.  Artificial lighting is available for circumstances where natural sunlight is not sufficient, but that usually requires a power source to operate.  For a large area of plants that amounts to a lot of power, so natural sources are usually preferred, even if it needs to be concentrated.

====Soil====

Plants on Earth often grow in soil, which is broken down rock plus microorganisms, water, nutrients, and organic matter.  Hydroponics dispenses with the inert rock component, which can save mass for space projects. If radiation shielding is required, though, the inert rock component can serve a dual function.  While fully developed soils are only known from Earth, there are many sources in space of small rock particles, water, and carbon which make up a large part of soil mass.

====Food====

Human food requirements can be measured in terms of total energy, commonly measured in '''Food Calories''' which are equivalent to 4184 Joules of available energy. The requirements are also measured by a wide variety of specific nutrients in specific amounts. It may not be efficient to supply all the low mass nutrients in a given situation, while supplying the main ones by mass. Whatever nutrients are not obtained from the closed loop system would have to be supplemented from outside, or simply done without for short missions. Human requirements can be translated to specific growing areas per person using known data on agricultural productivity.  This data can be modified by designs of space systems.  For example, if a plant needs 12 hours of sunlight per day, you can grow twice as much in the same area by using trays that are swapped every 12 hours, and storing the other tray under the illuminated one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Using Gold and Silver coins the players decide what their characters need (or can afford) to buy, in order to outfit them for the coming adventures. Weapons, Armour, Lanterns, Rope, Provisions and many other things are available to the Adventurer with ready money chinking in their purse! The DM should decide what is available, how much it costs and who is selling it. A short adventure can revolve around a shopping expedition for unusual kit or having special items fabricated by a master craftsmen. Some Equipment will be found on the players adventures, some is very common and some extremely rare and difficult to obtain, making it very desirable!

== C++ Book Main Page ==

I made a PDF Version of the C++ Book. The C++ book main page is protected. So I can not link it. Could you link it there please. [[File:CPlusPlusProgramming.pdf]] [[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 10:15, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

Administration may disregard this request, to include the PDF. (see [[Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming#C.2B.2B_Book_Main_Page|C++ Programming talk]] for my reply to the user).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 11:47, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

Further discussion on the talk page of the c++ wikibook. [[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 12:09, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

:There is no standing opposition to the inclusion of the PDF requested by [[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]]. In any case since the page protection has no merit it should be lifted and the page restored, at least to the version before the protection.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:19, 20 April 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Making the Transition==
Not all high school students are ready for college once they graduate.  Many high schools today have &quot;[[w:Tracking_(education)|tracks]]&quot;, which are programs designed to prepare students for their future career plans.  For example, &quot;college prep&quot; is a common track that is slightly more challenging for high school students as they are prepared for additional education in college.  Additional tracking programs include &quot;tech prep&quot; and &quot;dual enrollment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey2002&quot;&gt;Bailey, Thomas R., Katherine L. Hughes, and Melinda Mechur Karp. 2002. “What Role Can Dual Enrollment Programs Play in Easing the Transition between High School and Postsecondary Education?” For full text: http://www.ed.gov/offices/OVAE/HS/bailey.doc. Retrieved January 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these tracks are geared toward smoothing the transition into college for high school students.  Tech prep can be a helpful approach, but it has a major drawback - not all universities recognize this program and some refuse to transfer the credits toward an undergraduate degree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey2002&quot;/&gt;  Dual enrollment is also a beneficial program and it overcomes the major drawback of the tech prep track - universities are much more likely to recognize the transfer credit.  The only concern with dual enrollment is that the courses are typically taught by high school teachers and not college professors, which may not give students a good feel for the different teaching styles students will experience in college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey2002&quot;/&gt;

In the preliminary chapter we discussed equivalence classes on sets. If the reader has not yet mastered this notion, he/she is advised to do so before starting this section.

== Normal Subgroups ==

Recall the definition of kernel in the previous section. We will exhibit an interesting feature it possesses. Namely, let &lt;math&gt;ak\,,\,k\in\ker\,\phi\leq G&lt;/math&gt; be in the coset &lt;math&gt;a\ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a &lt;math&gt;k^\prime\in\ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;k^\prime a=ak&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;. This is easy to see because a coset of the kernel includes all elements in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that are mapped to a paticular element. The kernel inspires us to look for what are called ''normal subgroups''.


'''Definition 1:''' A subgroup &lt;math&gt;N\leq G&lt;/math&gt; is called ''normal'' if &lt;math&gt;gNg^{-1}=N&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. We may sometimes write &lt;math&gt;N\trianglelefteq G&lt;/math&gt; to emphasize that &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 2:''' A subgroup &lt;math&gt;N\leq G&lt;/math&gt; is normal if and only if &lt;math&gt;gN=Ng&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': By the definition, a subgroup is normal if and only if &lt;math&gt;gNg^{-1}=N&lt;/math&gt; since conjugation is a bijection. The theorem follows by multiplying on the right by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


We stated that the kernel is a normal subgroup in the introduction, so we had better well prove it!


'''Theorem 3:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\,G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be any homomorphism. Then &lt;math&gt;\ker\phi\leq G&lt;/math&gt; is normal.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;k\in\ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi(gkg^{-1})=\phi(g)e^\prime\phi(g)^{-1}=e^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;gkg^{-1}\in\ker\phi&lt;/math&gt;, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a group homomorphism. Then if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(H)&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h\in \phi^{-1}(H)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi(ghg^{-1})=\phi(g)\phi(h)\phi(g)^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;ghg^{-1}\in \phi^{-1}(H)&lt;/math&gt;, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 5:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a group homomorphism. Then if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi(H)&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;g^\prime \in \mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; And &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(g)=g^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;g^\prime \phi(h) {g^\prime}^{-1}=\phi(g)\phi(h)\phi(g)^{-1}=\phi(ghg^{-1})=\phi(h^\prime)\in\phi(H)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;h^\prime\in H&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal. Thus &lt;math&gt;g^\prime \phi(H){g^\prime}^{-1}=\phi(H)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g^\prime\in\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a surjective group homomorphism. Then if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi(H)&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Replace &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; in the proof of Theorem 5. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Remark 7:''' If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, it does '''not''' necessarily imply that &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The reader is invited to display a counterexample of this.


'''Theorem 8:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H,K&lt;/math&gt; be subgroups. Then

:i) If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal, then &lt;math&gt;HK=KH&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

:ii) If both &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are normal, then &lt;math&gt;HK=KH&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

:iii) If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are normal, then &lt;math&gt;H\cap K&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': i) Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be normal. First, since for each &lt;math&gt;k\in K&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;h,h^\prime\in H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;kh=h^\prime k&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;KH=HK&lt;/math&gt;. To show &lt;math&gt;HK&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup, let &lt;math&gt;hk,h^\prime k^\prime\in HK&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;h^\prime k^\prime (hk)^{-1}=h^\prime k^\prime k^{-1} h^{-1}=h^\prime h^{\prime\prime}k^\prime k^{-1}\in HK&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;h^{\prime\prime}\in H&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal, and so &lt;math&gt;HK&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup.

ii) Let &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;hk\in HK&lt;/math&gt;. Then since both &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are normal, there exists &lt;math&gt;h^\prime\in H\, ,\,k^\prime\in K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ghkg^{-1}=ghg^{-1}k^\prime=gg^{-1}h^\prime k^\prime =h^\prime k^\prime\in HK&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;gHKg^{-1}=HK&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;HK&lt;/math&gt; is normal.

iii) Let &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h\in H\cap K&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;ghg^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt; since H is normal, and similarly &lt;math&gt;ghg^{-1}\in K&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;ghg^{-1}\in H\cap K&lt;/math&gt; and it follows that &lt;math&gt;H\cap K&lt;/math&gt; is normal. {{Unicode|∎}}


=== Examples of Normal Subgroups ===

In the following, let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be any group. Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has associated with it the following normal subgroups.

:i) The ''center'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;Z(G)&lt;/math&gt;, is the subgroup of elements which commute with all others. &lt;math&gt;Z(G)=\{z\in G\mid (\forall g\in G) zg=gz\}&lt;/math&gt;. That &lt;math&gt;Z(G)&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup is easy to verify and is left to the reader.

:ii) The ''commutator subgroup'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;G^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;[G,G]&lt;/math&gt;, is the subgroup generated by the subset &lt;math&gt;\{[g,h]\mid g,h\in G\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;[g,h]=g^{-1}h^{-1}gh&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;s\in G&lt;/math&gt;, we introduce the shorthand &lt;math&gt;sgs^{-1}=g^s&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have &lt;math&gt;s[g,h]s^{-1}=[g^s,h^s]&lt;/math&gt;, such that for any product of commutators &lt;math&gt;[g_1,h_1][g_2,h_2]...[g_n,h_n]&lt;/math&gt; where all elements are in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;s[g_1,h_1][g_2,h_2]...[g_n,h_n]s^{-1}=[g_1^s,h_1^s][g_2^s,h_2^s]...[g_n^s,h_n^s]&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;G^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; is normal.


'''Remark 9:''' We can iterate the commutator subgroup construction and define &lt;math&gt;G^{(0)}=G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^{(n)}=[G^{(n-1)},G^{(n-1)}]&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. We will not use the commutator subgroup in future results in this book, so for us it is merely a curiosity.

== Equivalence Relations on Groups ==

Why are normal subgroups important? In the preliminary chapter we discussed equialence relations and the associated set of equivalence classes. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a group and &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation, when does &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; admit a group structure? Of course we have to specify the multiplication on &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt;. We will do so now.


'''Definition 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we define multiplication on the equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;[a][b]=[ab]&lt;/math&gt;


This is indeed the only natural way to do it. Take the two equivalence classes, choose representatives, compute their product and take its equivalence class. The alert reader will have only one thing on his/her mind: is this well defined? For a general equivalence relation, the answer is no. The reader is invited to come up with an example. What is more interesting is ''when'' is it well defined? By the definition above, we obviously need the projection map &lt;math&gt;\pi\,:\, G\rightarrow G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;a\mapsto [a]&lt;/math&gt; to be a homomorphism. We can in fact condense the requirements down to two, both having to do with cancellation laws.


'''Theorem 11:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; an equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a group under the natural multiplication if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;a,b,g\in G&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a\sim b\,\Leftrightarrow ag\sim bg \wedge ga\sim gb&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Assume &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a group. Since &lt;math&gt;a\sim b \,\Leftrightarrow [a]=[b]&lt;/math&gt;, the property follows from the cancellation laws in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Assume now that the property holds. Then its multiplication rule is well defined, and must verify that &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a group. Let &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in G&lt;/math&gt;, then associativity is inherited from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;([a][b])[c]=[ab][c]=[(ab)c]=[a(bc)]=[a][bc]=[a]([b][c])&lt;/math&gt;.

The identity in &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalence class of &lt;math&gt;e\in G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;[e]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;[e][a]=[ea]=[a]=[ae]=[a][e]&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, the inverse of &lt;math&gt;[a]&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;[a^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;[g][g^{-1}]=[gg^{-1}]=[e]=[g^{-1}g]=[g^{-1}][g]&lt;/math&gt;.

So &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; really defines a group structure, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


We will call an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; ''compatible'' with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a group. Then, &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''quotient group'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;. Also, as an immediate consequence, this makes &lt;math&gt;\pi\,:\, G\rightarrow G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; into a homomorphism, but not just any homomorphism! It satisfies a universal property!

'''Theorem 12:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; be en equivalence relation compatible with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; a group homomorphism such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim b \,\Rightarrow\, \phi(a)=\phi(b)&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a unique homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}\,:\, G/\sim\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi=\tilde{\phi}\circ\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': In the preliminary chapter on set theory, we showed the corresponding statement for sets, so we know that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; exists as a function between sets. We have to show that it is a homomorphism. This follows immediately: since &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}([a])=\phi(a)&lt;/math&gt; by commutativity, we have &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}([a])\tilde{\phi}([b])=\phi(a)\phi(b)=\phi(ab)=\tilde{\phi}([ab])=\tilde{\phi}([a][b])&lt;/math&gt;. As stated already, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}([a])=\phi(a)&lt;/math&gt; shows uniqueness, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}

''Proof'': First off, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty since &lt;math&gt;e\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;b\sim e \,\Leftrightarrow\, e\sim b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; by multiplying on the left by &lt;math&gt;b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Then since &lt;math&gt;e\sim a&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}\sim e&lt;/math&gt; by the same argument. Applying transitivity gives &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}\sim b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, multiplying on the left by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;e\sim ab^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, giving &lt;math&gt;ab^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;H=[e]&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup.

Assume &lt;math&gt;a\sim b&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;[a]=[b]&lt;/math&gt; implying &lt;math&gt;[a^{-1}b]=[e]&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b\in [e]&lt;/math&gt;. Now assume &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b\in [e]&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;[a^{-1}b]=[e]&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;[a]=[b]&lt;/math&gt; and finally &lt;math&gt;a\sim b&lt;/math&gt;.

Assume &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup, we have &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}bH=H&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;aH=bH&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, assume &lt;math&gt;aH=bH&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}bH=H&lt;/math&gt;. Since in paticular &lt;math&gt;e\in H&lt;/math&gt;, this implies &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b\in H&lt;/math&gt;, completing the proof. {{Unicode|∎}}

Stating the theorem and writing out the proof is left to the reader as an exercise.


We have showed how an equialence relation defines a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. In fact the equivalence classes are all cosets of this subgroup. We will now go the other way, and show how a subgroup defines an equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 14:''' Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then,

:i) &lt;math&gt;a\sim_L b\,\Leftrightarrow\,a^{-1}b\in H\,\Leftrightarrow\,aH=bH&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim_L b\,\Leftrightarrow\,ga\sim_L gb&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We will prove i). The proof for ii) is similar and is left as an exercise for the reader.

The fact that &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation and that &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b\in H\,\Leftrightarrow\,aH=bH&lt;/math&gt; was proven in the section on subgroups. Assume &lt;math&gt;a\sim_L b&lt;/math&gt;. Then for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(ga)^{-1}(gb)=a^{-1}g^{-1}gb=a^{-1}b\in H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ga\sim_L gb&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 15:''' For every equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim_L&lt;/math&gt; on G such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim_L b\,\Leftrightarrow ga\sim_L gb&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique subgroup &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; are precisely the left cosets of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': This follows from Lemma 13 and Lemma 14.


Again, the mirror statement is completely analogous. Stating the theorem is left to the reader as an exercise.

== Quotients with respect to Normal Subgroups ==

'''Lemma 16:''' An equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;[e]=H&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Assume &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is compatible, &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;a\sim e&lt;/math&gt;, and compatibility gives us &lt;math&gt;gag^{-1}\sim gg^{-1}=e&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;gag^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary, we obtain &lt;math&gt;gHg^{-1}=H&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal. Assume now that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal. Then &lt;math&gt;aH=bH\,\Leftrightarrow a^{-1}b\in H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Ha=Hb\,\Leftrightarrow ab^{-1} \in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;aH=Ha&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Using this, we obtain &lt;math&gt;a\sim b\,\Leftrightarrow ab^{-1}=ab^{-1}bg(bg)^{-1}\sim e \,\Leftrightarrow ab^{-1}bg=ag\sim bg&lt;/math&gt; and similarily for the right hand case, so &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 17:''' When an equivalence relation is given by specifying a normal subgroup &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the quotient group with respect to this equivalence relation is denoted &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this complies with previous definitions of this notation.

Multiplication in &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; is given as before as &lt;math&gt;(aH)(bH)=(ab)H&lt;/math&gt;, with identity &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(aH)^{-1}=a^{-1}H&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 18:''' Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then we define the ''projection homomorphism'' &lt;math&gt;\pi\,:\, G\rightarrow G/H&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\pi(a)=aH&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 19:''' A subgroup is normal if and only if it is the kernel of some homomorphism.

''Proof'': We have already covered the left implication. For the right implication, assume &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal. Then &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; is a group and we have the projection homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\pi\,:\,G\rightarrow G/H&lt;/math&gt; as defined above. Since for all &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\pi(h)=hH=H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ker\,\pi=H&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the kernel of a homomorphism. {{Unicode|∎}}

:i) Show that &lt;math&gt;Z(SU(n))=SU(n)\cap Z(U(n)\approx \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;

:ii) Using the second isomorphism theorem, show that &lt;math&gt;PSU(n)\approx PU(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Networking==
A very effective way to obtain a job after college is to utilize networking - i.e., people you know.  Some research indicates that students who utilize their fraternity and sorority networks, including other members and alumni, are more likely to obtain high paying jobs than individuals who do not have these resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marmaros2002&quot;&gt;Marmaros, D., &amp; Sacerdote, B. (2002). Peer and social networks in job search. European Economic Review, 46(4–5), 870–879. doi:10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00221-5&lt;/ref&gt; Former college students, when asked, reported that networking through their fraternity or sorority was a very helpful way to find a good job. Students receiving help and advice from their fraternity or sorority members are more likely to not only find a job, but to find a job they like.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pike2003&quot;&gt;Pike, G. R. (2003). Membership in a Fraternity or Sorority, Student Engagement, and Educational Outcomes at AAU Public Research Universities. Journal of College Student Development, 44(3), 369–382. doi:10.1353/csd.2003.0031&lt;/ref&gt; Finding a job through fraternity and sorority networks often results in a greater mean salary than those who find jobs through other networks or through other references, like: professors, alumni, career services, relatives, or alone.

Fraternity and sorority members are also often more involved than students not in fraternities or sororities in activities relating to student learning and intellectual development. Some fraternities and sororities also have a GPA requirement that must be maintained, which leads to greater student success in college. Furthermore, students in fraternities and sororities reported having significantly higher levels of active and collaborative learning, as well as greater interaction with their professors, other faculty members, and peers. This resulted in advantages in both academic and personal development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pike2003&quot;/&gt;

== Fraternity and Sorority Membership and Drinking Alcohol ==
Seven out of eight college students (or 87.5%) drink and 44% engage in binge drinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;&gt;Sher, K J, B D Bartholow, and S Nanda. 2001. “Short- and long-term effects of fraternity and sorority membership on heavy drinking: a social norms perspective.” Psychology of Addictive Behaviors: Journal of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors 15(1):42-51.&lt;/ref&gt; College is a period of time associated with heavy levels of drinking. It is also associated with elevated risk for acute health problems, including serious injury and psychological distress. Membership in a [[w:fraternity|fraternity]] or [[w:sorority|sorority]] leads to drinking more heavily and frequently.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Park2008&quot;&gt;Park, Aesoon, Kenneth J. Sher, and Jennifer L. Krull. 2008. “Risky Drinking in College Changes as Fraternity/Sorority Affiliation Changes: A Person–Environment Perspective.” Psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors 22(2):219-229.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, membership in a fraternity or sorority increases the odds of developing dependence symptoms, initiating or continuing abusive alcohol use patterns, and experiencing alcohol related problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt; Those who join fraternities later in their college careers experience an increase in abusive alcohol consumption while those who leave fraternities and sororities experience a decrease in such activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Park2008&quot;/&gt;

The reasons why members of fraternities and sororities are more likely to consume alcohol are not perfectly clear, but it appears as though social norms play a prominent role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt; Members of these groups view drinking as more of a social norm.  However, many members of these groups enter college with these beliefs, which may indicate that it is not exclusively the environments of the fraternities and sororities that lead to these attitudes and behaviors but prior views of the members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt;  Heavy drinkers and partiers in high school may intentionally seek out fraternity and sorority membership because they are aware of the reputation these organizations have for drinking and partying.&lt;ref name=&quot;Park2008&quot;/&gt;  Other factors that may contribute to alcohol use among members of these groups could be the characteristics of the members.  Members of these groups tend to score high on extraversion and also tend to be impulsive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Park2008&quot;/&gt; 

Despite the differences in drinking during college, three years after college the levels of drinking of members of fraternities and sororities does not appear to be significantly different from that of college graduates who were not in these types of organizations.  This is suggestive of a pro-drinking environment in fraternities and sororities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt;

=== Usage ===

This template is a trivial wrapper around [[Help:Editing#Interlanguage links|interlanguage links]]. It is meant as a way to prevent interlanguage links from appearing in print versions of books such as PDF files generated by [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf|wb2pdf]]. There are two unnamed arguments: the first is the language code; the second, the name of the destination page in the sister wiki. Therefore,
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Haskell/Interlanguage|nl|Analyse}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
becomes:

::Indeed some of the content could be used for that work and probably other psychiatry books but not as a simple merge. Someone would have to carefully select the usable content and take in consideration that some of the ideas expressed on the work are now outdated. Since the work is now Wikisource I see no value in keeping this apparent duplication.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:29, 17 March 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Is It Possible to Finish College in Four Years?==
While just half of incoming freshmen at public universities in the US finish their college degree in four years, it is possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowen2009&quot;&gt;Bowen, William G., Matthew M. Chingos, and Michael S. McPherson. 2009. Helping Students Finish the 4-Year Run. The Chronicle of Higher Education. September 8, 2009. http://chronicle.com/article/Helping-Students-Finishthe/48329/&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it requires careful planning and diligence. 

If you want to finish your degree in four years, take the following steps:
#Work out a four-year plan that includes every course you'll need to take to complete your major and when you'll take each course.
#Sit down with your advisor and make sure your plan is accurate and reasonable.
#Stick to your plan.

Some things that can impede your progress include: losing motivation, taking on a job, and changing your major.  Also, make sure you complete any paperwork you need for graduation well in advance of the deadline. If the noted steps are followed, you should have no trouble getting your degree on-time. In-fact, it is even possible to finish college early if a student takes advantage of online and summer courses.

Unfortunately, there are also some factors that can impede college completion that may not be within a student's control.  Things like limited family income or attending a community college increase the odds of not completing one's degree or not completing it in four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowen2009&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Zyprexa.jpg|thumb|Zyprexa (olanzapine) 10 mg tablets]]
[[w: Olanzapine | Zyprexa]] (olanzapine), a product of the pharmaceutical giant [[w: Eli_Lilly_and_Company | Eli Lilly &amp; Co]], was introduced in 1996 as an atypical [[w: Antipsychotic | antipsychotic]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot;&gt;Berenson, Alex (2007). Lily Settles with 18,000 over Zyprexa. The New York Times http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9f00e5db1430f936a35752c0a9619c8b63 &lt;/ref&gt;. Approved by the [[w: Food_and_Drug_Administration | FDA]] for the treatment of Schizophrenia and Bipolar Mania, Zyprexa accounted for almost one-third of annual revenue for Eli Lilly since the drug's introduction, with global sales exceeding $4 billion dollars in 2006 &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot;/&gt;. Zyprexa has been prescribed to nearly 26 million people since 1996 &lt;ref&gt; Lilly Resolves Investigations of Past Zyprexa Marketing and Promotional Practices (2009). Eli Lilly and Company. http://newsroom.lilly.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=359242 &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Marketing Strategy===
Eli Lilly is widely criticized for employing irresponsible marketing strategies that down-played the risks and promoted &quot;off-label&quot; usage of Zyprexa. 

====''&lt;small&gt;Off-label Marketing&lt;/small&gt;''====
:While only approved for schizophrenia and bipolar mania, the drug was marketed to doctors and patients for a wide range of unapproved and questionable treatments. For example, Eli Lilly established a &quot;Viva Zyprexa&quot; campaign that promoted the use of Zyprexa for symptoms including agitation, hostility, aggression, depression, and sleep or mood disturbances &lt;ref name=&quot;Settlement&quot;&gt; Eli Lilly Zyprexa Settlement: Drug Maker to Pay Record $1.42 Billion (2009). Find Law. http://commonlaw.findlaw.com/2009/01/eli-lilly-zyprexa-settlement-drug-maker-to-pay-record-142-billion.html &lt;/ref&gt;. No specific clinical studies had been performed to examine Zyprexa's effect on these symptoms.

:Eli Lilly also specifically targeted the elderly suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's &lt;ref name=&quot;generics&quot;&gt; Eli Lilly profit drops sharply on Zyprexa generics (2012). Reuters. http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/31/us-elililly-idUSTRE80U0R020120131 &lt;/ref&gt;. Leaked documents show that Eli Lilly instructed pharmaceutical salespeople to make dementia the first message for primary care physicians, since Schizophrenic patients were typically reported to specialists &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot;/&gt;. Similarly, other documents show Eli Lilly claiming that Zyprexa is a safe choice for treating agitation and confusion. The sales slogan &quot;5 at 5&quot; was allegedly used by salespeople to promote 5mg of Zyprexa at 5pm to help the elderly sleep. However, Zyprexa had not been approved for any such treatments and, in fact, suggested harmful side effects during clinical trials &lt;ref name=&quot;Settlement&quot;/&gt;.

====''&lt;small&gt;Down-played Risks&lt;/small&gt;''====
:Concerned that sales of the drug might suffer if they were more forthright, Eli Lilly instructed sales representatives to down-play the risks of Zyprexa. Clinical trial documents showed that 16% of patients gained more than 66 pounds within a year of use. Moreover, the effects of the drug on diabetes risk were extreme &lt;ref name=&quot;Settlement&quot;/&gt;.  In 2001, the American Medical Association published a study reporting that patients taking Zyprexa had a ten times higher risk of developing diabetes. Similar cases have been identified for Ketoacidosis and Pancreatitis &lt;ref&gt; Zyprexa: hyperglycemia and diabetes (2011). 1 Boring Old Man. http://1boringoldman.com/index.php/2011/03/26/zyprexa-hyperglycemia-and-diabetes/ &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Zyprexa side effects (2005). Van Der Ginst Law, P.C. http://www.zyprexa-lawsuit.net/zyprexa-side-effects.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;. Researchers also discovered that the elderly were twice as likely to suffer stroke or fatal injury while on Zyprexa. Although the FDA and regulatory agencies in the UK and Japan all warned that Zyprexa might lead to diabetes, Eli Lilly failed to disclose this information &lt;ref name=&quot;generics&quot;/&gt;.

===Legal Consequences===
Through 2008, Eli Lilly had paid out over $1 billion to settle more than 32,000 Zyprexa lawsuits. In 2009, Eli Lilly entered a guilty plea with federal prosecutors of the Pennsylyvania Federal court for illegally marketing Zyprexa &lt;ref name=&quot;Settlement&quot;/&gt;. While doctors hold the authority to prescribe drugs for conditions that they haven't been approved for, it is strictly illegal for pharmaceutical companies to promote off-label usage of their drugs. Eli Lilly, guilty of these actions, was forced to pay $1.42 billion for its misdemeanor violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in addition to other state level lawsuits &lt;ref name=&quot;Settlement&quot;/&gt;.

The terms of the plea agreement also include compulsory compliance in a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of the Inspector General (a division of the U.S. department of Health and Human Services) &lt;ref name=&quot;generics&quot;/&gt;. This includes an external compliance program that will be in effect for five years, Although very similar in protocol to the internal compliance policies existing at Eli Lilly, this program includes third-party review for all systems, processes, policies, procedures, and practices.

==General Pharmaceutical Misconduct==

Such actions are widespread in the pharmaceutical industry. Of the top 10 pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world, all 10 have been involved in similar deceitful behaviors. Pfizer, the largest pharmaceutical manufacturer in the world, has been found guilty of falsely advertising and deceiving doctors about its prized possession, Lipitor. Lipitor is the best-selling prescription substance in the world &lt;ref&gt; Edwards, Jim (2010). Lawsuit Claims Pfizer Deceived Doctors Into Prescribing Its Cholesterol Drug Lipitor. CBS. http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-42844207/lawsuit-claims-pfizer-deceived-doctors-into-prescribing-its-cholesterol-drug-lipitor/ &lt;/ref&gt;. Novartis, the second largest pharmaceutical manufacturer in the world, in 2010, paid over $200 million for off-label marketing &lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy&quot;&gt; Lucy, C (2010). Big Pharma Lawsuits – Who Got Hit with the Biggest Settlement?. Lawyers and Settlements. http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/blog/big-pharma-lawsuits-who-got-hit-with-the-biggest-settlement-05310.html &lt;/ref&gt;. Sonafi, the next largest manufacturer, paid $100 million for similar activities in 2009 &lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy&quot;/&gt;. Similarly, Merck, the manufacturer of Vioxx, faced billions of dollars in lawsuits for falsely advertising its blockbuster drug &lt;ref&gt; Wilson, Duff (2011). Merck to Pay $950 Million Over Vioxx. The New York Times. http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/business/merck-agrees-to-pay-950-million-in-vioxx-case.html &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Economics of the Pharmaceutical industry===
To fully understand the ethical misconduct at hand, it is important to first examine why these major pharmaceutical companies behave in such a manner. Similar to any other business, large pharmaceutical companies are driven by profit incentives. [[w: Pharmaceutical_Research_and_Manufacturers_of_America | PhRMA]] and the [[w: IFPMA | IFPMA]], two major lobby groups for the pharmaceutical industry, state that the main objectives of the pharmaceutical industry are to deliver safe and effective pharmaceuticals to patients while also maintaining profitability for its investors &lt;ref name=&quot;phrma&quot;&gt; Pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of America (2011). http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/159/phrma_2011_annual_report.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;ifpma&quot;&gt; International federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers &amp; associations: corporate brochure (2010). http://www.ifpma.org/fileadmin/content/About us/1 Welcome/IFPMA_Corporate_Brochure_LowRes[1].pdf &lt;/ref&gt;
. It is this latter part of this agenda that is often responsible for pharmaceutical misconduct.

[[File:PofesionalismWikibookZyprexa1.png|right|500px| |thumb]]
====''&lt;small&gt;The Drug Development Process&lt;/small&gt;''====
:In the United States alone, $300 billion dollars is spent annually on prescription drugs &lt;ref&gt; Huges J, Moore M, Snyder E (2002). Napsterizing Pharmaceuticals: Access, innovation, and consumer welfare. 2002 NBER Working paper &lt;/ref&gt;. With the promise of such a large market, pharmaceutical companies actively attempt to establish a larger market presence. Over the past 20 years, nearly 1900 new pharmaceuticals have been granted approval by the FDA&lt;ref name=&quot;phrma&quot;/&gt;. With a very low chance of success, the development of each one of these medicines involves significant monetary and time commitments by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Pharmaceutical companies begin with a pool of over 10,000 compounds of interest. After approximately 10 years of product testing and clinical trials, a handful are selected for in vivo evaluation. Of these handful, one or two are tested on human volunteers, with a single compound from the initial 10,000+ moving into end stage studies before being submitted for regulatory review and approval. This process requires exorbitant financial investments. Nearly $800 million is spent on average on R&amp;D alone to bring a single new drug to market&lt;ref name=&quot;phrma&quot;/&gt;. In 2009, PhRMA estimated that nearly $65.3 billion on R&amp;D by the research-based pharmaceutical industry&lt;ref name=&quot;phrma&quot;/&gt;.

====''&lt;small&gt;Questionable Practices&lt;/small&gt;''====
:To recoup the R&amp;D costs and generate profits from their discoveries, pharmaceutical manufacturers rely on patents. Currently, manufacturers of pharmaceuticals like Zyprexa have approximately 8-10 years of effective market exclusivity due to patent expirations and competition from generics &lt;ref name=&quot;ifpma&quot;/&gt;. Due to this limited period of exclusivity, pharmaceutical companies have adopted many questionable strategies to maximize profits. These strategies include competitive practices with generic manufacturers, finding loopholes in the patent system, and [[w: Ghostwriter#Medical | ghostwriting]]. However, the practice that raises the greatest ethical issues is advertising to medical professionals and consumers. Over $11 billion is spent annually by pharmaceutical companies to promote and market their products &lt;ref&gt; Wazana A (2000). Physicians and the pharmaceutical industry. Is a gift ever just a gift? JAMA, 283, pp. 373–380 &lt;/ref&gt;. In 2009, the top 20 proprietary pharmaceutical companies spent around 30% of their total revenues on marketing &lt;ref&gt; Glasgow, L J. (2001). Stretching the Limits of Intellectual Property Rights: Has the Pharmaceutical Industry Gone Too Far?, 41 IDEA 227, 250-251 &lt;/ref&gt;. A majority of this expenditure is in the form of gifts and sponsored events for physicians. Physicians often use these company sponsored events, such as the Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs to learn about new medicines &lt;ref&gt; Gagnon MA., Lexchin J. (2008). The Cost of Pushing Pills: A New Estimate of Pharmaceutical Promotion Expenditures in the United States. PLoS Med 5(1):e1.doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0050001 &lt;/ref&gt;. As these events are sponsored and conducted by the pharmaceutical manufacturers, they provide an opportunity for these companies to falsely advertise their products. With large investments at stake and investors demanding returns, the pharmaceutical industry often exaggerates the scope and safety of their products. These false claims frequently lead to improper prescribing practices by medical practitioners and, as has been the case for Zyprexa and many other blockbuster pharmaceuticals, hundreds of thousands of injuries and deaths to patients.

==Similar Cases==
Professional ethical misconduct is not limited to pharmaceutical companies. Such examples are present in every field where a professional's actions resulted in untold damages to those who depended on them. [[Professionalism/Frederic Whitehurst and the FBI | Frederic Whitehurst and the FBI]] and the [[Professionalism/Sherron Watkins and Enron | Enron scandal]] are two such examples. In the first case, Frederic Whitehurst was an FBI agent who discovered and exposed illegal evidence manipulation in the FBI crime lab.  Likewise, Enron was an energy company that duped its investors out of billions of dollars by falsely reporting its finances.  The consequence for the professionals in these instances is the loss of trust and, accordingly, the loss of autonomy not only for themselves but also for other professionals in their field. In the case of Eli Lilly this was demonstrated by a drop in sales of Zyprexa after the scandal broke &lt;ref&gt;Brickates, Val (2007). Lily CEO: Zyprexa Sales Flat. MarketWatch http://articles.marketwatch.com/2007-03-14/news/30734464_1_zyprexa-eli-lilly-lilly-ceo &lt;/ref&gt;. Not only do these decreased sales show a lack of trust in Lilly, but also in the doctors prescribing this drug and the FDA, who approves it for general market sale. Similarly, Eli Lilly is now subject to supervision by the Office of the Inspector General as they were no longer deemed trustworthy to ethically regulate their actions. For the FBI, the loss of autonomy played out in the form of investigation and accreditation by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors while the consequences for Enron and Arthur Andersen were far more severe. Both companies were virtually run out of business. Moreover, their actions led to the enactment of many laws regulating auditing practices nationwide. Companies that had no part in this scandal felt the backlash.

==Diminishing Professional Trust==
All of these examples are from situations that, on the surface, are vastly different from each other, yet share a common theme. In each, there existed a group of professionals, organizations like Lilly, the FBI, and Enron, trusted by the public and, subsequently, given a certain autonomy. In each situation, these professionals failed in their duties to serve the public, resulting in deaths, wrongful convictions, or loss of billions of dollars. However, these consequences extend beyond these casualties. Such actions lead to a complete loss of trust and, therefore, autonomy for these companies and the associated professionals. From these cases it is evident that autonomy is an important, perhaps even fundamental, element of being a professional. But if this power is abused it will quickly be revoked. To keep this autonomy, professionals must be trusted. Therefore, maintaining trust is an essential part of being a true professional.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Off Campus Housing==
Although it depends on where you desire to live, students can save money by choosing to live off campus. Colleges make money from campus housing.&lt;ref name=&quot;crystal2011&quot;&gt;“Save Money with Off Campus Housing.” Accessed February 14, 2013. http://www.budgetinginthefunstuff.com/save-money-with-off-campus-housing/.&lt;/ref&gt;  By moving off campus but continuing to share expenses with roommates, it is possible to save money. While it depends on where you choose to live and how many roommates you have, the financial savings from moving off campus can be substantial. In a calculation prepared for a college course, two students at the University of Tampa estimated that they could save almost $2,000 per year living off campus ($8,518 per year on campus with no kitchen; $6,910 per year on campus with a kitchen). Even if you have to pay rent over the summer, this can still be cheaper than on campus housing. Other estimates concur that it can be substantially cheaper to live off campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegeaid2013&quot;&gt;“Change of Living Situation | The University of Chicago College Admissions.” Accessed February 14, 2013. http://collegeaid.uchicago.edu/costs/livingchange.shtml.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studying==
It may be difficult to study in your dorm room if you share a room.  This may be the case if you and your roommate(s) do not share a schedule or have different views toward studying and academic success.  If you find it difficult to study in your dorm, a good alternative is the library, where patrons are required to be quiet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sexual Health Statistics ==
As of 2008, 98% of women and 97% of men between the ages of 25-44 reported having had vaginal intercourse, 89% of women and 90% of men reported having had oral sex with an opposite sex partner, and 36% of women and 44% of men reported having had anal sex with an opposite sex partner. Onset of sexual activity begins after age 15, and by age 24 most people have had sex.  Attending college slightly reduces the odds of having had any form of sex compared to those with no high school diploma, but not substantially.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHSR2008&quot;&gt;Sexual behavior, sexual attraction, and sexual identity in the United States: data from the 2006- 2008 National Survey of Family Growth.” National Health Statistics Reports (36):1-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are twice as likely as men to have had any type of sex with the same sex. For women aged 18 – 19 years old, 90% identified themselves as heterosexual, 1.9% homosexual, and 5.8% bisexual. For males of the same age, 96% said they were heterosexual, 1.6% homosexual, and 1.1% bisexual.

==Sexual Dangers ==
Individuals who engaged in riskier sex - sex with a non-intimate person, sex without a condom, and casual sex - in high school are likely to continue to engage in riskier sex in college, as most social behavior does not change in this transition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey2008&quot;&gt;Bailey, Jennifer A., Charles B. Fleming, Jessica N. Henson, Richard F. Catalano, and Kevin P.  Haggerty. 2008. “Sexual Risk Behavior 6 Months Post-High School: Associations with College Attendance, Living with a Parent, and Prior Risk Behavior.” Journal of Adolescent Health 42(6):573-579 Web. 13 Mar. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  These behaviors are riskier because they increase the odds of both sexually transmitted infections and sexual violence.  According to one recent survey, about 64% of college students engage in these types of risky behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey2008&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Acceptance Rates==
Acceptance rates for universities vary substantially depending on a number of factors. To begin with, there are some characteristics of universities that influence acceptance rates, including the number of applicants the university receives for admission, as well as the university's size, location, and reputation.  On the other side, there are a number of characteristics of students that influence their odds of being accepted at a university, including: [[w:Grade (education)|GPA]], [[w:Standardized test|standardized test scores]], and involvement in extracurricular activities. In the United States, acceptance rates range from 4% to 100%. At a mid-sized urban university in Florida, the University of Tampa, the acceptance rate is approximately 57.3%.&lt;ref name=&quot;USNews&quot;&gt;US News and World Report http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-tampa-1538&lt;/ref&gt; Just because colleges need students, doesn’t mean that getting in is easy. There is some evidence to suggest that enrollment in colleges is becoming more difficult and competitive as more people are choosing to go to college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petersons&quot;&gt;http://www.petersons.com/college-search/college-admission-requirements-competitive.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Competition===
One reason why it is becoming increasingly difficult to gain admittance to universities, particularly the most elite universities, is because of international competition.  For instance, there are some elite high schools in South Korea that are geared toward preparing their students to gain admission to [[w:Ivy League|Ivy League]] universities in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillon2008&quot;&gt;Dillon, Sam. 2008. Elite Korean Schools, Forging Ivy League Skills. New York Times. http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/world/asia/27seoul.html&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal of an Ivy League education in South Korea is quite high. Students attending these school study fifteen hours a day and take extremely challenging classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillon2008&quot;/&gt; On top of the heavy academic workload, students still find time to squeeze in extracurriculars and clubs in order to boost their extracurricular transcripts.  One of these schools, [[w:Daewon Foreign Language High School|Daewon Foreign Language High School]], is known for being particularly grueling. All but a few of the graduates go on to Ivy League colleges. Over 100,000 Korean students are currently studying at American Universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillon2008&quot;/&gt; Because of the Korean obsession with Ivy League schools, Korean applications to American schools have significantly increased over the years, increasing the competition for admission to these schools for students from the US.

      <text xml:space="preserve">At many colleges and universities across the US, safety is a prominent concern. In 1990, the Clery Act was passed to make it a requirement for schools to release all information regarding crime in the surrounding area. This act made it easy for people to see the safety of schools before committing to a university with high crime rates in the area. The act has encouraged universities to be more open about criminal activity in the surrounding area. Many universities now send emails to all students, faculty, and staff whenever a criminal act occurs in the immediate vicinity of the university. Despite the increased efforts of colleges and universities to make this information available, there is some evidence that students either do not pay attention to it or do not take it all that seriously.  Forty percent of students report receiving a crime report in an admissions packet, but 81% weren't sure if incoming students looked at the report when deciding on a school and only 6% said they thought students use it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steven2005&quot;&gt;Steven, M. J., &amp; Plummer, E. (2005). The clery act, campus safety and the views of assault victim advocates. College Student Affairs Journal, 25(1), 116-130. &lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate campus safety and security, many schools have a fully-functional police force, as well as victim advocate programs, criminal activity alerts, and sensor activated and restricted access dorms. As much effort as schools put towards safety, some of the responsibility does fall on the student. Many students are taking personal steps to insure their safety, including: traveling with another person around campus, not staying out late, and staying in safer parts of the surrounding town or city. 

==Sexual Assault==
While college campuses are generally quite safe, a concern female students, in particular, face is sexual assault.  There are a variety of situations that increase the risks of sexual assault, and women should be aware of these (though of course victims are never responsible when such an assault takes place).  For instance, accepting a ride with a male acquaintance, leaving a drink unattended at a bar or party, or allowing someone else to pour or buy you a drink can be risky situations as someone could take advantage of those situations to assault or drug someone.  Some research suggests that female students do not perceive these as being risky.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawford2008&quot;&gt;Crawford, Emily, Margaret O’Dougherty Wright, and Zachary Birchmeier. 2008. “Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault: College Women’s Risk Perception and Behavioral Choices.” Journal of American College Health 57(3):261-272.&lt;/ref&gt;  While most women recognized the risks associated with having someone else pour them a drink, many did not recognize the risk of leaving a drink unattended.  Additional education on college campuses about behaviors that may leave women open to these risks is warranted.  While the perpetrators are at fault, until women are no longer at risk of victimization they should consider taking precautions.

      <comment>/* Effective Studying Methods */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A notable difference between college and high school is that college professors don't simply provide answers and they seldom provide study guides. All the information needed for success in college is available to students, but one of a student's many responsibilities is to utilize all available resources to learn the information. That means studying.  If you didn't have to study to do well in high school, you are likely in for a surprise in college.

==Effective Studying Methods==
A growing body of research examines effective study methods.  Two common approaches are practicing retrieval and concept mapping.  In [[w:retrieval practice|retrieval practice]], students read the study material and then recall the information. This is an active cue driven form of studying.  [[w:Concept mapping|Concept mapping]], which is an elaborative study method, involves students enriching material they are studying by creating associations between the concepts within an organized structure.  At least one study suggests that retrieval practice results in better long-term retention, an improvement of over 50% over concept mapping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karpicke2011&quot;&gt;Karpicke, Jeffrey D., and Janell R. Blunt. 2011. “Retrieval Practice Produces More Learning than Elaborative Studying with Concept Mapping.” Science 331(6018):772 -775.&lt;/ref&gt;  Interestingly, students were under the impression that they would retain more through concept mapping. This research supports the idea that retrieval practice promotes meaningful learning of complex concepts commonly seen in the sciences. Concept maps could be made in the absence of learning materials, making it a function of retrieval rather than elaborative studying, and the nature of an activity determines the extent of the learning; this needs to be taken into consideration when educational activities are devised. According to the article, “During elaboration, subjects attain detailed representations of encoded knowledge by enriching or increasing the number of encoded features. But during retrieval, subjects use retrieval cues to reconstruct what happened… in free recall, subjects must establish an organizational retrieval structure and then discriminate and recover individual concepts within that structure… the act of reconstructing knowledge itself enhances learning.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Undergraduate vs. Graduate school==
Choosing your undergraduate university based on whether or not it has a graduate program in an area you are considering pursuing may not be the best choice. Whether or not you get accepted into graduate school is not really based on where you receive your undergraduate degree, but what you do to set yourself apart from other students applying for the same graduate degree program. Also, undergraduate students often change their majors.  Thus, if you choose a program because it has graduate program X and you end up switching to major Y, your decision to attend that university based on the graduate program could become a problem.  Finally, universities with graduate programs often have faculty who are more focused on teaching graduate students and doing research than on teaching undergraduates, so you may not get many opportunities to work with those professors, even if they are well-known scholars.

== Why consider graduate school? ==
You should only consider graduate school if you are very dedicated to a chosen career path and realize that it is going to take a very long time and a lot of hard work to pursue that career.  Graduate school is extremely challenging.

If you're considering graduate school based on any of the following reasons, you may want to reconsider:&lt;ref name=&quot;agre1996&quot;&gt;http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/grad-school.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*you don't know what else to do with your life
*you &quot;kind of&quot; like a topic
*you think it would be cool to have a PhD
*you don't want to disappoint your parents
*you did well as an undergraduate

== Increasing the odds of getting in ==
If you're still interested in graduate school, take some time to talk to professors who work in the field you are interested in. Try to find a general understanding of what it would be like to work in that field and see if you are truly interested in pursuing that career choice. Be sure to ask the advice of various people so you aren’t given biased information, and really think about whether graduate school is the right course of action for you. It is a long, hard, five to seven year process that is not suited for everyone. 

There are also some things you can do to increase the odds of getting in:&lt;ref name=&quot;jmu&quot;&gt;http://www.jmu.edu/socanth/anth/wm_library/So_you_want_to_go_to_grad_school.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*gain valuable experience in your field by working directly with a professor
*maintain a competitive GPA
*network with people in the field
*make connections with your professors, as you'll need letters of recommendation

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Financial Aid and Persistence==
Many students receiving financial aid are underfunded.  One study found that students in Ohio had uncovered needs of $1,400 or more per year, making it difficult to complete their education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bettinger2004&quot;&gt;Bettinger, Eric. 2004. “How Financial Aid Affects Persistence.” National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series No. 10242. Retrieved (http://www.nber.org/papers/w10242).&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that financial aid, particularly more comprehensive financial aid, reduces dropping out and increases persistence and retention in college.  

==Financial Aid==
One of the biggest factors inhibiting college attendance is the price tag, both of credit hours and all the extras, like textbooks. Some donors make it possible for people coming from less affluent families to attend college but sometimes even with this financial aid, college is still impossible. The US Government, through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, offers financial aid through grants and loans. The FAFSA can be challenging to complete, but many high school counselors are now learning how to complete it, and more often than not, the counselor at the college you are interested in would be more than happy to help you. 66% of all undergraduates going to college received some sort of financial aid from the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;UT2012&quot;&gt;&quot;Financial Aid.&quot; UT by the NUMBERS. The University of Tampa. Web. 13 Mar. 2012. &lt;http://www.ut.edu/financialaid/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Education noted that for the year 2007-2008, “For those who received any aid, the total average amount received was $9,100.”&lt;ref name=&quot;USDofE&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. (2009). 2007-08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS: 08) Student Financial Aid Estimates for 2007- 08, Selected Findings.&lt;/ref&gt; This number only reflects what was awarded through the FAFSA. Many high school and college students fail to apply for any outside scholarships, or those awarded to students that meet qualifications, like good leaders, excellent grades, or minority status. 

==Student Loans and Debt==
Recent studies have shown that the amount of student debt accumulated by college students has gone up in recent years. According to The Project on Student Debt at the Institute for College Access and Success, students who graduated from college in 2010 with student loans owed an average of $25,250, up 5 percent from the previous year. &lt;ref name=StudentDebt2010&gt;&quot;Student Debt and the Class of 2010.&quot; Institute for College Access and Success: Project on Student Debt. n.d. Web. 5 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  About two-thirds of the class of 2010 graduated with student debt, though the debt examined in the report does not include loans taken out by parents. The report is based on data from more than 1,000 colleges, representing half of all public and private nonprofit four-year schools. The average amount of debt would be even higher if the report included profit-making schools, where almost all students take out loans and, according to federal data, borrow about 45 percent more than students at nonprofits.&lt;ref name=&quot;StudentDebt2010&quot;/&gt; In a survey of more than 1,000 colleges, 98 colleges said their 2010 graduating class owed an average of more than $35,000, and 73 colleges reported that more than 90% of students graduated with some amount of debt. It’s estimated that two-thirds of college seniors who graduated in 2010 had student loan debt.&lt;ref name=Blake2011&gt;Ellis, Blake. &quot;Average Student Loan Debt Tops $25,000.&quot; CNNMoney. CNN. 3 Nov. 2011. Web. 5 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; High-debt states are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, while low-debt states are mainly in the West.

      <comment>/* College Myth: There is nothing to do on college campuses */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nothing To Do? ==
Some college students may believe that there is not much activity on their campus.  This is unlikely to be true on most college campuses, as colleges and universities have begin to focus more attention on student life and activities for students in order to improve the college experience.  For instance, The University of Tampa has over 160 clubs and organizations that students can join. These range from academic-oriented clubs to intramural sports groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;UTclife&quot;&gt;http://www.ut.edu/campuslife/&lt;/ref&gt;  Many universities also include a wide variety of fraternities and sororities that plan numerous activities, both on and off campus.  Students can also take advantage of recreation opportunities on campuses, like fitness centers, game rooms, parks, and practice fields for playing sports.  Many universities also have a student-led group on campus that is responsible for planning large events, like concerts and movies.  Students can learn about what events are happening by checking the university's event calendar online.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''durable good''' is a good which lasts for a long time, so does need to be purchased often. It can be used many times before it needs to be replaced. A diamond ring is a durable good because it can be expected to last a very long time, without wearing out or needing to be replaced. In contrast, a non-durable good (such as a sandwich) does not have a long life full of many uses. Economists such as [[w:Ronald Coase|Ronald Coase]] have pointed out that a monopolist selling a durable good is in a harder position than a monopolist of non-durable goods because with durable goods, the monopolist is essentially competing with itself over time&lt;ref name=coase1972durable&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Coase| first1=Ronald| year=1982| journal=Journal of Law and economics| title=&quot;Durability and Monopoly&quot;| volume=15| Number=1|pages=143-149| url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/725018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A monopolist who sells a fine oak desk this year reduces the demand for a similar desk next year.

Government and news reporting which uses the expression &quot;durable goods&quot; is usually about things like refrigerators, cars, factory machines, and the like. However, an information good in a digital format can be more durable than a machine built to last 20 years. In this chapter, we'll consider particular issues for information goods&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Several things which are often emphasized in studying the strategy of a durable-goods monopolists are less relevant for information goods. For example, a monopolist of a physical good may take pains to commit to limited production, but with digital copying of information goods, that isn't a very viable strategy. Similarly, a manufacturer of airplanes might consider the increased marginal cost of making a more durable plane which will have greater overall demand, but greater durability. Such trade-offs aren't very relevant for a monopolist of an information good.&lt;/ref&gt;. For this chapter, you will need to understand various background material on time, including backward induction and discounting.

== Durable goods provide a flow of services ==
In studying the nature of durable goods, it is frequently useful to describe the consumer as consuming a flow of services over time from the good. Rather than considering a consumer as consuming a CD, we can consider the consumer as consuming the service of listening to the CD this week, next week, until the consumer loses interest, technology makes the CD obsolete or the CD breaks somehow.

When modeled this way, we assume the consumer places a value for consuming the service in each period. The consumer's willingness to pay for a durable good will be the present value for them of this flow of services.

=== How far can the idea of durability extend? ===
{{cquote|A ticket to a first-run movie has the durable quality that once someone has seen the film that person is unlikely to buy a second ticket. Thus, the movie company will find the demand for tickets on any rerelease of the film to be negatively related (ceteris paribus) to the number of viewers who saw the film when it first came out.&lt;ref name=bulow1982durable&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Bulow| first1=J.I| year=1982| journal=The Journal of Political Economy| title=&quot;Durable-goods monopolists&quot;| volume=90|number=2|pages=314-332| url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1830295}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The quote above shows that sometimes &quot;durability&quot; is a matter of consumer tastes rather than the nature of the product. Consider a piece of music versus a movie. Both are information goods, which can be delivered on a CD/DVD or via download, for rental or sale. However, a piece of music is likely to have a lot of value in repeated listening while a movie will probably have less value in repeated watching&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;This is a generalization, of course. Some people like to watch some movies repeatedly. This is particularly evident to parents of young children who learn to despise their kids' favorites.&lt;/ref&gt;. In some sense, you could say that a movie watched in once September might still be delivering a flow of services in November when the viewer can still remember what they enjoyed about it. In any case, from the point of view of the firm trying to profit from the good, a single viewing of a movie may be thought of as the sale of a durable good, while a single listen to a song may not. So, you can listen to newly released songs on broadcast radio, but not view newly released movies on broadcast television.

We shouldn't forget, however, that there is more than durability going on in the difference between second-run and first-run movies. Movie studios use time-delay as an important too of price discrimination as well.

== Costs associated with durable goods ==

Because durable goods last for a long time they tend to be more expensive to both manufacture and purchase while non-durable goods have a shorter life span and usually cost less to produce and procure. The exchange for between high durability and marginal cost presents sellers with a tough question Just how durable should they make the product? To make a product more durable it requires more thorough work and the use of superior materials increasing the marginal cost of the manufactured good.  The naturally high price of durable goods causes them to generally be items of investment, this also makes it more likely that individuals are able to rent them where non durable goods are usually items of consumption and therefore not necessarily rentable.

Sometimes companies tend to avoid producing products that are perfectly durable because they will lose a consumer's business after that transaction. It is in the company's interest to make products that are durable but need to be replaced over time. A consumer wants a product that is durable and will get a lot uses out of it.  This is where the balance between durability and marginal cost must be made, the item must be durable enough to entice purchase so that marginal costs may be covered.

However, the cost structure mentioned does not pertain to information goods.  Information goods do not need a long physical life like manufactured goods do therefore the above information does not pertain to that market.

== Durable information goods ==

When discussing durable information goods, an example would be a book because this item would be able to last a long time and many people could obtain the information. This book can be passed down to many generations in a family. An even better example of an information durable good is an online website. The online website can last for many years for consumers to read as long as it is not deleted by the creator or shut down. Not all information goods are durable. An example of a non durable information good is a stock tip. This tip is considered to be an information good but will only be good for a certain period of time since the market is always changing. More than likely, a consumer would not be able to use this stock tip in the future. Therefore the good is non-durable.

One important thing to note about durable information goods is that their value may deteriorate, but the information is still durable. The value of news decreases with time because the information, while being durable, does tend to lose importance and the interest of others as its currency depreciates.  Value deterioration can also be seen in software due to compatibility, as systems change and require different or newer software the other is left with less value. Another example of deteriorating value is found in popular arts, as common taste in particular popular arts lessens so does the value.  Popular arts may consist of things such as video games, an example of the loss of value within the video game market pertaining to piracy and resale and how PlayStation and Xbox are trying to fight it is given below.
:*'''[http://games.slashdot.org/story/12/04/20/2153251/if-you-resell-your-used-games-the-terrorists-win Damage of Piracy and Resale in the Video Game Market]'''
::The ability to buy pre-owned computer and console video games has caused a threat to the industry.  Because those who buy the game in the first few days possibly have the power to pirate the contents of the game and then resell it at lower than market price the value of the game and its contents goes down. Resale has taken the largest hit on the value of single player games given that taste has swayed towards multi-player in addition to the mentioned piracy. Game designers are even claiming that the repercussions from piracy and resale include the increase of game prices since the game makers are only receiving mass amount of profits from the first day of sales because they are not given any share of the resells.

== Depreciation rate for business software ==

Depreciation Rate is defined by the percentage rate at which an asset devalues. Furthermore, this is computed by dividing the depreciable cost of the asset by the number of years in the asset's estimated productive or useful life.

Business Software is important for any organization or company. Any individual or CEO might buy business software to improve the efficiency of the business and maintain data collected. This software helps cut costs and speeds up any production outputs. Although business software will be a durable good for many years it will slowly depreciate it's value due to fast pace technology advancements. Over time companies will need to update or replace their software when it is not compatible with their current business. 

One of the more popular Business Software programs is: Microsoft Office which contains multiple uses such as Power Point, Excel, Word, and many others that Business owners use every day. This software will have many useful years but will be depreciate in the future due to technology advances and companies will want higher technology to improve their efficiency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Relationship Violence==
College can be a tumultuous time when it comes to relationships.  Many students have relationships, but many of those relationships are unhealthy.  One study found that 44.7% of college students reported having experienced violence in a relationship.  Of those, 27.7 reported emotional violence, 24.9% reported sexual violence, and 20.9% reported physical violence; 51.8% experienced 1 type of violence, 31.9% experienced 2 types of violence, and 16.2% experienced all 3 types of violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forke2008&quot;&gt;Forke, Christine M., Rachel K. Myers, Marina Catallozzi, and Donald F. Schwarz. 2008. “Relationship Violence Among Female and Male College Undergraduate Students.” Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med 162(7):634-641.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all of this violence occurred during college; in fact, most reported greater violence prior to college. Of the victims: 46.2% were victims before college only, 31.3% were victims before and during college, and 22.5% were victims during college only. Most physical and emotional violence is perpetrated by the victim’s partner, followed by friends or acquaintances and strangers. By comparison, victims of sexual violence reported the perpetrators to be distributed equally among partners, friends and acquaintances. Relationship violence is never okay; college students should be aware that this is a possibility and should take advantage of on campus counseling services if something like this occurs.

==Happiness==
College may be fun, but is it the happiest time in your life?  According to some research, women feel most confident with their body shape and love life at 28. At 30, they start worrying about wrinkles and grey hair. However, women are happiest with their careers at 29 and most content with relationships at 30. At 32 they are at ease with their home and family life financially are happiest at age 33.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beeghley2007&quot;&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/women_shealth/9422638/Women-feel-most-attractive-at-28.html&lt;/ref&gt; These findings would suggest that women may be happier just after the typical age at which they attend college.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The notion of remixing has become a much debated topic in today's culture; especially when it involves the remixing of music. With the recent growth of remixing in the music industry, there have been numerous discussions regarding various topics that have an economic background when it comes to information and durable goods. Some of these topics include cumulative innovation, intellectual property laws in relation to the art of remixing along with the effects of these laws, and synthesis between multiple parties.  

== History ==

The definition of remix culture is defined as the sharing and exchange of creative information using digital technologies that use the cut/copy and paste method. Remixing music is relatively new when it comes to forms of music considering music has existed in cultures across the world for thousands of years. The idea of remixing, that is taking an original copy and altering its features to create another copy on the basis of the first one, was first established in the 1960s and the 1970s. It was predominately done in New York City with roots in Jamaican styled music. At the time, remixing was already prevalent in the native land of Jamaica and was called 'versioning'. However, as it was brought over to the night life in NYC it was mainly used in the disco styles of music that would later lead to an influx of hip/hop subcultures and styles of music.  &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;&gt;[http://remixtheory.net/?page_id=3 Remix Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; As this styles appeared more and more as the fan base grew, DJs started to use various methods to create these new versions of older songs by changing aspects of the original. One of the techniques used was called &quot;beat juggling&quot;, or beat mixing. The concept of this was all done on turntables and was done on point by the disk jockey's or DJs for short. These turntables were electronic devices commonly used in the art of Djing. They would allow the DJs to mix music by taking various segments of multiple songs and placing them on top of each other or intertwining them. These turntables allow DJs to essentially create a new musical masterpiece with the flip of a switch or the press of a button. Some common methods used by DJs to mix songs include taking the original beats of the songs and either speeding them up, slowing them down, or placing beats on top of each other to create different samples on-top of the original one. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; 

=== Non-music remixing ===

Of course outside of the musical realms of remixing, there are also other media forms where remixing occurs. Most of these different styles first emerged in the 21st century as technology advancements created new programs that allowed for such remixes to be born. Using these software programs that would literally cut, copy and paste. For example, software such as the program Maya, uses 3-d modeling to create animation in films such as Spiderman and Lord of the Rings. What this program was doing however, was taking multiple methods of animation technology and mixing them together to create in depth animations for production. Although this can be difficult to comprehend as a remixing technique, it is still considered one simply because it is the art of taking multiple, simple animations previously created and creating a more advanced animation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt;--[[User:ItsVerdy|ItsVerdy]] ([[User talk:ItsVerdy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ItsVerdy|contribs]]) 02:45, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

==Different forms of remixing==
There are various forms of remixing which all have similar but very different themes revolving around how they came about and what kind of different styles and methods they take on. The different forms of remixing are as follows:

* Mashups
* Remixes
* Regenerative Remix
* Megamix

=== Mashups ===

The first kind of mashup that exists is called the regressive mashup, which is found in music production. This is the most common form of remixing and is what people are most familiar with when they think of a mashup. The idea behind a regressive mashup is to take two previously recorded songs/productions and push them together so that they mesh to make a melodic sound for the ears. This kind of mashup is most common and often takes lyrics from one song and placing them on top of the beat of another song.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New Math of Mashups&quot;&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/01/10/050110crmu_music id=The New Math of Mashups]&lt;/ref&gt; The second kind of mashup is a called a reflexive mashup and this is actually found outside of music. An example of this would be a map that has taken two previous forms and has combined them to create a better and more in depth map.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; By using a program such as Web 2.0, this type of mashup is taking samples from two or more initial models to combine them to create access to more complete information. Some might see the traditional Web 2.0 program as one that is not typically used for mashups. However, what web 2.0 is doing is taking sampling from various and combining them to allow software to perform specific tasks that it would not have been able to do itself while not changing the original code of the application. This is done through either static or dynamic sampling. Static sampling is when data from another source is taken only once while dynamic sampling occurs multiple times and is constantly updated as it is done. An example of a software mashup is Google Maps/Earth. With this program, users are not only able to receive directions, but they are also able to see street level views of various businesses. Users are able to find a restaurant of their liking for example, and click on that street level view to receive links to reviews of that restaurant or even possibly the menu. This is a mashup between software used in the mapping of Google, along with software that is used to link the restaurant information to a search engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Web Application Mashups&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=tHQB-kLxlZ8C&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=regenerative+remix&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oVsHZs8VjW&amp;sig=TzUZ4CZCx_13mjabLXg7_8Xv7DI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=osuhT5vKKuWbiALYm4XeBw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=regenerative%20remix&amp;f=false id=Web Application Mashups]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remixes===

The most common type of remix is the one that occurs within music. A musical remix is taking an original song and altering the song's qualities without getting rid of the song's original &quot;spectacular aura&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; This aura is defined as what makes the song unique to any other musical composition, whether it be the lyrics, beats per minute, length, melody, etc. The first ever considered musical remix was done by Walter Gibbons on the song &quot;Ten Percent&quot; by the band Double Exposure. Although remixing was first established, the first ever recorded musical remix of this song was not done until 1976. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; This is an example of the first kind of remix, and extended version remix. 

The second kind of remix is called a selective remix. This kind of remix constitutes of adding or subtracting aspects from the original composition of the song. This type of remix became apparent in the music industry in the 1980s. Club DJs used this type of remix to add or subtract new sounds within the content of the original song and was often used in the nightlife scene in terms of music. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt;.

Last but not least is the reflexive remix. This style of remix would actually change the &quot;spectacular aura&quot; as mentioned above through adding or subtracting various musical elements or notes. The majority of these types of remixes will often extend the length of the original due to the addition of new sounds, beats, or musical styles and/or elements. One of the first and most famous reflexive remixes ever done was composed by the notorious DJ named Mad Professor when he remixed the whole entire album &quot;Protection&quot; by Massive Attack and then renamed it &quot;No Protection&quot;. At the time of this remix, both albums were released in the same year (1994) which caused some conflict between whether the changes were a production of ingenuity or if the remixed work was essentially stealing another's intellectual property rights. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt;

===Regenerative remix===

There is a minor difference when it comes to the difference between a regular remix and one that is regenerative; however, it makes a huge difference in the implications of both types. As previously stated above, a remix is using a previously already established platform (whether it be a musical song or a software program) to create a new entity. The only difference between a regenerative remix and that of a remix, is the time. A regenerative remix is comprised of transfiguring multiple elements that are not constant. In other words, the elements from which are being used have data that is constantly being updated versus staying the same in the sense of a regular remix. With the recent influx of technological advancements in the 20th century, the regenerative remix in the form of software mashups and information has become much more prevalent and has created a subculture without anyone realizing it. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; For more clarification, a more concrete example of a regenerative remix can be found in something like Yahoo News. All of the news in the world is constantly being updated and at one point, is never truly the same. The information is always changing. The reason Yahoo News is an example of a regenerative remix is because Yahoo doesn't actually create the content, but instead it takes the data from multiple sources and simply compiles it for easy access to all. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt;  Aspects such as this regenerative remix example have created a sub-culture of information sharing between multiple users. Other examples include platforms such as Expedia for travel fares, YouTube for video sharing, or Groupon for coupon sharing. 

===Megamix===

The last form of remixing is the megamix, which is only seen in music remixing unlike some other forms. A megamix is taking the melodies of numerous songs and mixing them together to form a separate melody. The main difference between a megamix and a regular remix is with a remix, the melody being remixed is from a single song or played by a single artist(s). This megamix often done by DJs for the most part because as previously noted it takes a a couple bars from multiple melodies to mix together to create a melodic tune. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; The most unique aspect of a megamix is what it does. A megamix tells a story through music and gives the listener a fluid path in which that person listens to. Megamixes are almost always longer in length because of this intertwining of multiple songs together to create this story for who ever is listening to it. What the megamix does is it allows the person who is listening to it to recall a whole time period versus a single artist or composition by taking multiple songs and mixing them together with a common, fluid groove all based on the listeners recognition of the songs. This is what makes a megamix allegorical. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt;

==Intellectual Property and the Law==

Their has been much debate between the art of music and the copyright laws that are connected to them. It is not always black and white, as the terms of what is allowed and disallowed is often argued about. In terms of music itself, the original composition and the person that made that composition is the owner of that song. More detail will follow what intellectual property is, the legality behind it in relation to original compositions and remixing, and how it is viewed and works within the industry.

===Intellectual property rights===

Intellectual property is defined as the untouchable aspect of property. It is the ideas of a creator that leads to the personal property of that person. Intellectual property is the result of ingenuity that is created from a creators mind of brain and then established into a form that has physical and tangible property rights. The creation of music falls under this category because music is a form of a durable good; once it is created, the original never goes away or ceases to exist. &lt;ref name=&quot;Intellectual Property Rights&quot;&gt;[http://www.hg.org/intell.html id=Intellectual Property Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright act of 1976===

The copyright act of 1976 was developed to protect the original arts of individuals. It protects people from having their innovations, whether it be a tangible object or not, from being replicated. It lays down the rules and regulations regarding copyright infringement and what needs to be done in order to have a work protected under copyright law. &lt;ref name=&quot;Copyright&quot;&gt;[http://www.rbs2.com/copyrm.pdf id=Copyright] &lt;/ref&gt; In most cases that arise in courts involving copyright infringement for music, most judges have been accused of misinterpreting the law when it comes to the music. In most cases, judges have been blamed for establishing judicial opinions that made it seem like they did not understand music. A famous example is the case Northern Music vs. King Record in which Judge Ryan established a judicial opinion that would prevent certain aspect of music from being copyrighted such as drum solos. However, this is not followed as a precedent in cases following it. &lt;ref name=&quot;Copyright&quot;/&gt; 

The way copyright laws are viewed in terms of remixing music is rather gray. Because remixing is taking original works and mixing these together to make a new work, there are many arguments on wether remixes are even legal. Mostly all original works that are remixed are protected by some sort of copyright law because of the fact that they are intellectual property. So their is argument that when these original songs are being used by another party to create new music that it is stealing. However, there are many artists that thrive off of remixing such as the artist Girl Talk. Girl Talk is taking original works and mixing them together to create something new. &lt;ref name=&quot;Synthesis&quot;&gt;[http://nkelber.com/engl293/blog/?p=566 id=Synthesis] &lt;/ref&gt; What Girl Talk is doing is using creativity of their own to create new works. This is following the notion of information synthesis, something that can occur when it comes to economic information goods. Synthesis is defined as the creation of a something new on the basis of combining two or more things to create it. For economic information goods such as music, there is high amounts of value in the music and wether it is being used to remix. Music that is more popular will obviously have much more value to it if it becomes synthesized. &lt;ref name=&quot;Synthesis&quot;/&gt; This where the argument arises when it comes to copyright laws over music. Stanford Professor Lawrence Lessig argues that artists should make all of their work available to be used to create new work through information synthesis. He also argues that after all, all cultural creations have used some sort of cumulative innovation at some point in time so it is unfair to persecute the same type of innovation within music. &lt;ref name=&quot;Synthesis&quot;/&gt;

===Cumulative innovation===

Cumulative innovation is described as when there is any instance of something new being created with more than one source. Remixing music is a direct example of cumulative innovation because it is the art of creating a new entity, in this case a new song, cd, etc., from original sources. As noted above in the previous section, copyright laws have limited the amount of innovation that can occur when it comes to remixing because it protects the original piece and eliminates creativity. This is creating an innovation dilemma in music between the trade offs of protecting an original work of art and eliminating creativity and innovation to establish new information goods and cultures. &lt;ref name=&quot;Dilemma&quot;&gt;[http://leeds.academia.edu/GrahamDutfield/Papers/890732/The_Innovation_Dilemma_Intellectual_Property_and_the_Historical_Legacy_of_Cumulative_Creativity id=Dilemma] &lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect that takes place with cumulative innovation is the opening of networks for information goods to be shared. In general music is a closed network that is generally sponsored. It's network externalities are also two sided in the sense that it is music artist creating music for listeners. However, when cumulative innovation comes into play with remixing music, it helps open this network up. This is similar to going back to what Professor Lessig mentions when he believes all artist should let their music be used as a platform for new creations of ingenuity. What others have argued in terms of cumulative innovation is that music, especially remixing, would not exist without cumulative innovation at some point in history. To bring up copyright laws on artists who use remixing to create new works is similar to saying that the cumulative innovation in the music culture of hip hop was originally stolen from the blues music culture. &lt;ref name=&quot;Dilemma&quot;/&gt;

There is some basis for economic arguments when it comes to remixing solely because music is a form of a durable information good with two sided network externalities. The major argument is whether artists should allow this network to be open rather than closed. In today's world, it is very difficult to prevent someone from downloading music and then remixing it so some argue that music should be automatically expressed as an open platform for free use while still recognizing the original as intellectual property rights.

The change on Latex toc and use of the Template:LaTeX/Top seems not to take into account the print function. Am I right ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 16:25, 24 April 2012 (UTC)
:Oh... Actually, I don't know... I am rather used to wikipedia and this is not something I knew... I tried looking at [[Using Wikibooks/Print versions and PDFs]] but I am not sure if that is what you are talking about... Can you explain me a bit, or give me the good help page to look at? Thanks! I also looked at the printable version and tried to understand what I did wrong, but could not figure it out...

==== Instructional Procedures ====

'''Day 1'''
The teacher gives a broad overview of the origin, the organization, and the tenets of the world's major religions (Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism). Information includes common symbols and representative music of each religion. Teacher checks for understanding during the instruction by using a student response system. Students take notes and respond to questions using their clickers (student response devices).

'''Day 2'''
Students take an online quiz (using [http://quizlet.com/ Quizlet]  covering the material from Day 1.

Students, working in pairs, select a religion to research from [http://www.religionfacts.com/big_religion_chart.htm this website] focusing on the symbols and music of the religion. Students use Diigo to collect sources, and they will record notes in a Google Doc.  The teacher provides guidance and checks websites' reliability.

==== Reflection ====
I’ve never written a lesson plan in my life, and developing this one was way out of my comfort zone.  It gave me a renewed appreciation for what K-12 teachers do (do they really write a plan like this for every lesson?), and it renewed my conviction that I did the right thing by majoring in computer science and not teacher education.  

Although I think I understand the concept of TPaCK, it’s more difficult to put into practice than it might seem, and that makes me wonder if I really do understand it.  I don’t know that much about world religions, and I know even less about the methods of teaching social studies to high school students; that left me feeling competent in only one of the three TPaCK areas - technology.  However, the activity types compiled by [http://activitytypes.wmwikis.net/ Harris and Hofer] put “legs” on the TPaCK concept and gave me a place to start.  

My process for designing the activities did not follow a neat sequential pattern.  In fact, I had to go back and revise the original activities and activity types, for my selected standards, after I had written the lesson plan.

Like most things, TPaCKing a lesson probably gets easier with practice, but this first time was like pulling teeth. ;)

'''Day 2'''
Students will choose one particular culture and look for information about its predominant religion. The focus of this research concerns the instruments used in the religion's ceremonies.  Students will create a video explaining their findings and share them in YouTube. A rubric identifies the number of images and other media elements, the depth and quality of the research, and additional important information.

'''Day 3'''
Students will write in a Google Doc ideas that illustrate their pre-existing knowledge about music and religious dances from South America.  Next, they will watch a video from a religious festivity in Chile at the following link - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4oYb5qwViE&amp;feature=related.  After the video, students will research this festival (and others across South America) and put the information in Google Docs.

'''Extensions''' 

Students are able to earn extra credit by completing one or more of the listed activities:
* Find additional types of dances that are related to religions in other parts of the world.
* Make a video simulating a religious ceremony including dancing and music - caution must be exercised with this option; any video must be respectful of the religious ceremony. 

'''Assessment Plan''' 

''Formative assessment''

Students have a rubric to develop self assessment and peer-assessment strategies. This rubric includes quality of the artifact, quality of the information included, and use of technology.

''Summative assessment''

Students are evaluated via a rubric. This rubric includes artifact quality, evaluation of the information included, use of technology, group work, self assessment and peer assessment.

==== Reflection ====
From my point of view, TPaCK opens a new approach.  This approach is based on learners' experiences. Students select information and create something with the information available.  Also, teachers become guides helping students to understand and apply the knowledge they acquire.

The challenges that I faced were Iowa Core Standards and creating lesson plans. The first lesson was fairly simple to create.  My greatest problem lay in imagining and developing the activities, because I am not a expert in music or history. Related to the lesson plan specifically, I can say this is the first time that I have seen a lesson plan like this, so it was a kind of difficult to understand the way it works.

In summary, I learned a lot doing this. I learned how to combine the three parts of TPaCK and create a lesson plan.

==== Reflection ====
TPaCK is an interesting method that I found to be very useful and possibly effective in any lesson plan strategy.  This method can be used to &quot;feed the need&quot; of anyone wanting to implement technology into his or her curriculum.

This approach is the opposite of how things are usually done.  Instead of a tool being implemented to improve a course, tools are usually added just because, it's the next new thing.  The TPaCK method forces you to think of the issue at hand and then what technology can be added to better the outcome you are trying to achieve.

'''Assessment'''

''Formative Assessment:'' Students are observed throughout the learning experience and submit evidence of progress at the end of each activity.

''Summative Assessment:''  Students use technology to communicate cultural similarities and differences in music and discuss their findings with classmates using VoiceThread. Quality will be evaluated using a rubric distributed at the beginning of the lesson.


==== Reflection ====

I found the TPACK method to be a logical, methodical process that can be used to introduce technology into conventional lesson plan development. As Judi Harris indicated, this process allows established learning goals and activities to guide appropriate technology choices, rather than selecting technology first and striving to fit learning goals to the capabilities of the technology.

This approach to technology selection is familiar to me. In my current role as a technology support specialist, one of my responsibilities is to recommend/select technologies that address and complement stated business needs. Identifying and clearly defining needs prior to selection and implementation is critical for success.

== &lt;font color=&quot;Green&quot;&gt;Group Report&lt;/font&gt; ==

'''Process Description''' 

We met via Skype and a Google Document to determine our subject, standards, activities and activity types.  We each selected two of the standards to work on, and then worked individually to flesh out the activities associated with each standard.  We met again to review our list and to make plans for next steps.  Each member then created individual lesson plans, and we met again to review our work and work together to finalize this group report.


'''Challenges''' 
* Finding times to meet that worked for everyone.
* Finding subject areas that pertained to our Performing Arts School.
* Reaching a common understanding of the assignment.
* Understanding the individual portion of this assignment.


'''Realizations''' 
* The overall process allowed us to better understand how to include TPaCK in a lesson plan.
* It is possible to develop group work at a distance using technology.
* TPaCK is more student-centered than other approaches.

The assignment allowed us to begin to develop skills necessary to select technology according the needs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Background===

An oligopoly is very similar to a monopoly in a sense where one company dominates the market but in this case there are at least two firms dominating the market. These firms are able to influence the price for a product in the market. A key component to an oligopoly is interdependence between the few firms which means that each firm must take into consideration reactions of the other firms in the market when the firm decides on a price. The products that the oligopolistic firms produce are typically very similar and are competing for market share. These companies don't have complete control since there are more than one firm with market power.

===Etymology===

The word &quot;oligopoly&quot; comes from two Greek words:  oligo, meaning &quot;few,&quot; and polein, &quot;sellers.&quot; 

===Concentration Ratios===
A Concentration Ratio is a tool used to illustrate total output produced in a certain industry by a given number of firms. Oligopolies can be discovered using concentration ratios because it measures the total market share dictated by the certain amount of firms. When a high concentration ratio is present in an industry, it can be identified the industry as an oligopoly. 

===Examples of Oligopolies===

::*Cell Phone Companies: AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile

::*Laundry Detergent: Tide, Arm &amp; Hammer, All, Cheer

===Barriers To Entry===

Oligopolies tend to continuously dominate the market because it can be costly or difficult for potential rivals to enter the industry. These high start up costs can be too expensive and the company is at risk due to the uncertainty for success. Paying for high start up costs will put a company in the negatives and can cause a company to become bankrupt.

===Cournot Solution===
In 1838 the first solution to oligopolistic interdependence is associated with Antoine Augustin Cournot who was a French economist as well as a mathematician. Even though most theories only applied to two firms he always emphasized his analysis to three or more. He resolved this problem by suggesting that firms strive to maximize their profits under the assumption that its rivals’ outputs were constant. Each oligopoly firm will supply that remaining share to maximize profits. Cournot’s wanted to provide his awareness of the interdependence between the oligopolists and he also made demand curves to illustrate the market's reaction.

IBM and other companies engaged in ways to automate certain business aspects. This started first with was data storage and computation or Utility Computing, which began as a metered service. This led to the development of On-Demand software. IBM is still in the On-Demand software business and it is estimated they will spend $10 billion a year on delivering and providing these software services. &lt;ref name=Background&gt; http://www.zdnet.com/news/on-demand-computing-what-are-the-odds/296135&lt;/ref&gt;

SaaS has come a long way and is constantly changing and new companies and features are popping up everywhere. With the evolution of SaaS it is possible to do things at home or from any computer. You can now do your taxes with the help of software such as TurboTax and QuickBooks without having to go down the street to an H&amp;R block or other firm. It is also possible for organizations such as restaurants to schedule employees and host training materials online with tools like WhenToManage. On the side of Customer Relationship Management firms could use tools such as Salesforce to schedule appointments and store important information. SaaS is changing the way the world does business.

With On-Demand software or Software as a Service a lot can be said for having extra help with running your business. The ability to have a software solution to handle issues that will cause businesses and individuals with headaches will alleviate pressures on employees and help businesses run more smoothly, effectively, and efficiently. There are many solutions out there for businesses that allow them to be more efficient. The explosion of smart phones and the app market has only helped this case. There are now apps people can have on their phone that help them deal with things such as personal finance, interview preparation, file storage, and many others. Applications like these help people keep track of purchases and bill paying bringing order to many peoples cluttered and hectic lives.

==Differentiation==

'''SaaS allows for:'''

*Easier Administration
*Time Savings
*Easier Collaboration
*Easier Accessibility

There are many different types of software that fall under this category. Here are a few examples:

*'''Customer Relationship Management''' 

Software as a Service is saving people and businesses time by automating things and providing tools to get things done. Take Salesforce for example, Salesforce announced in 2007 that it would now provide a platform for Financial Advisors. While working with many partners Salssforce was able to redefine how a Financial Advisor goes about everyday business. Merrill Lynch started using Salesforce software to help the company better manage clients. Salesforce allows them to put in client information including, notes on a Financial Advisor's last visit or talk with a client. Other things can also include a clients birthday as well as reminders to call the client for follow up meetings or discussions. Salesforce also allows them to bring up the clients information profile page when receiving a call from that client. Salesforce completely revamped financial services applications. Salesforce gives Financial Advisors everything they need in one place. This software will allow them to know their client better by having information about the client readily available. It also has plans of action for clients and has storage of specific goals by client so the Advisor can go into their page and know where they stand with each client. It allows teams to all have access to their own client’s information. This is helpful in many ways. When someone is out of the office and a client calls a team member can go into the system and have all the client information there. This helps big companies when clients work with specific people. Having Salesforce also eliminates a lot of paper from the workplace. Files are still kept for records but everything can be automated and put into Salesforce. This helps cut more time out of the equation and time savings is money savings. &lt;ref name=Differentiation4&gt;https://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/press-releases/2007/02/070227.jsp.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Accounting and Taxes'''

TurboTax simplifies many things about how people file their taxes, an individual 30 or 40 years ago would have to certainly go to an accounting firm or accountant to file their taxes and fill out forms. They would pay for this service and in many cases waste time preparing things for the accountant. Now we have services such as TurboTax and QuickBooks that can do these things for you. You pay for the software and can now, from your home computer, enter everything from your employers W-2 form and follow an easy step by step process to file your taxes. It takes very little time and effort and you can file your taxes online from your house without having to mail anything in.Every year people dread doing their tax returns, they have to go to a professional, in some cases they charge too much and the process is too complicated. TurboTax simplifies this by offering specific deductions and having a step by step guide with all of the information a user needs to file their taxes. There are many deductions people can take advantage of if they qualify. TurboTax will ask questions of you and based on how you answer it determines if you qualify for a deduction of that type. TurboTax even has a section for good will donations where you can type in what you gave away, say clothing for example, and it estimates a price for you. You can type in what clothes you gave away for instance a pair of pants, you then enter the condition of the pants and it comes up with a price figure for your contribution.&lt;ref name=Differentiation1&gt; http://www.turbotax.com/lp/ty11/ppc/blkbrd-dlx-nav.jsp?cid=ppc_gg_b_stan_dk_us_lv-trbtx-hw-mch&amp;adid=21654800388&amp;skw=how%20much%20is%20TurboTax&amp;kw=turbotax+costs&amp;ven=gg&amp;srqs=1&amp; &lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Administrative and Scheduling'''

WhenToManage software is made for the restaurant industry. It includes a cost saving and time saving way to put all the restaurants essentials in one place. In terms of scheduling WhenToManage allows for the managers and employees to take everything online. Managers and employees will each have login accounts for WhenToManage and managers can post schedules and also send time off requests to managers. A message can be sent out to notify all employees of their new schedule thus eliminating the need to go check the schedule or to swing by the restaurant to check when you are working. This software also allows employers to put up training and informational manuals for employees to have at their disposal. Instead of going into the store to pick up a physical copy or ask questions about different aspects of their job everything is online and readily accessible. &lt;ref name=Differentiation2&gt; http://www.saasdir.com/profile/whentomanage/&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies such as Del Friscos Restaurant Group have implemented this software. Del Friscos Restaurant Group has over 161 restaurants in the union and has benefited from having a way to track everything happening at all their restaurants. As a national chain it was hard to monitor financial figures on every store but implementing WhenToManage changed all of that. As a national company this helps them to keep track of everything easier and when going from store to store it allows for uniformity. According to research done by the Iternational Data Corporation employees spend on average over a quarter of their time looking for information and they only find what they are looking for half the time. Del Friscos Restaurant Group benefits greatly from having WhenToManage software. Information is now more readily available and less time is wasted. &lt;ref name=Differentiation3&gt;http://smartersoftware.whentomanage.com/lone-star-steakhouse/&lt;/ref&gt;

These are just a couple of examples of how Software as a Service is revolutionizing the way we do things. It provides a time and in many ways a cost saving. Time is a valuable commodity and many companies are developing SaaS that can save people and businesses a lot of time and energy.

==Market for SaaS==

Technology companies who have realized the potential for automating certain aspects of business are now benefiting from it. Starting in the 1960s with IBM firms have looked toward computing for business solutions. Now there are many firms in the market for Software as a Service. Market leaders such as Netsuite are profiting off of offering businesses services which have never existed before the technology and computing era. Microsoft did not take advantage of offering Software as a Service in many categories and has since paid for it. The success of smaller firms such as Intact, Netsuite, and Salesforce has hurt Microsoft as they are not a part of the SaaS market.&lt;ref name=MarketSaaS&gt; Defelice, A. &quot;Software As a Service.&quot; Accounting Technology. 23.6 (2007): 37-41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has fallen behind on SaaS as other smaller companies have taken market share right from under its feet. Microsoft has many software applications, typically sold in a bundle. This business does not have a large exposure in commercials but presentations are made every day to businesses offering them On-Demand software solutions. Between restaurants having SaaS has given them a competitive advantage and has streamlined the business. This can also be said for small businesses who have implemented software to reduce the amount of work or people they need to spend money on. 

==Implications==

Software as a Service has created a new market which, in the last ten years alone has ballooned in size. SaaS has created a new market which has positive economic benefits. In terms of networks more users will benefit from the existence of these services. This is true for all of On-Demand software. Companies also benefit from more users of their product. The existence of software such as WhenToManage, mentioned above, will allow companies to save money and streamline the ways that they make money. Salesforce will allow companies a competitive advantage in managing client relationships through having everything at their fingertips. This will allow Financial Advisors to take on more clients and increase their bottom line through expanding clientele and money managed. 

TurboTax will have slightly different implications. Companies such as H&amp;R Block are now forced to compete with a product that does not require a user or consumer to go to a physical location and sit down with a tax consultant. H&amp;R Block has come out with its own software and continues to compete for market share in the market for personal tax returns. 

It is expected that in the long term SaaS will be even more competitive as many technology and software companies will take advantage of a new way to make money by streamlining business operations. This industry will be more competitive because in the long term the cost of owning a particular software solution will increase. This increase will cause companies to compete in terms of prices and services offered. If users and businesses are billed at a flat rate it will be different than if they are paid per use and so on. Companies enjoy supply chain economies of scale by having copies upon copies of each product for nothing. They will also enjoy smaller costs associated with upkeep of their product. &lt;ref name=Implications1&gt;http://www.formtek.com/blog/?p=1481 &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Implications&gt; Fan, M, S Kumar, and A.B Whinston. &quot;Short-term and Long-Term Competition between Providers of Shrink-Wrap Software and Software As a Service.&quot; European Journal of Operational Research. 196.2 (2009): 661-671. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What a Good Chiropractor Can Provide You ==

Are you looking to find a treatment for your neck and back pain? Do you get migraines and headaches often? Does your body ache from a sports injury or a pinched nerve that does not seem to go away? You might find this article relevant in helping you find a solution to your problems through chiropractic care, and choose the right chiropractor North Sydney. 

Chiropractic is basically a physical therapy that focuses on the treatment of the central nervous system and the spine, and one of the best chiropractic services available today is at St. Leonards, North Shore. [http://wiki.monroe.edu/index.php/North_Sydney_Chiropractic Chiropractor North Shore] experts are responsible for helping you keep a healthy lifestyle, through working with the power of the body to naturally heal itself. 

The Chiropractor North Sydney has studied the relationship between the human spine structure and how that influences your health. They can spot and correct the source of your health issues that occur, caused by the misalignment of the spine’s vertebrae. 

While there are a number of North Shore Chiropractic clinics that are recommended, those in St. Leonards prove to be one of the most prominent. If you want to make sure that the chiropractic clinic you are going to provides quality services, you could ask them these queries:

-	Are the services covered by the Australian health fund? If they are, how much? 
-	Have they ever had a patient with the same case as mine?
-	The sessions, how much does each cost?
-	If availing for multiple sessions, will there be discounts?
-	Are they aiming to treat the main cause of the condition and put a patient onto the course of greater wellness?

All these questions, particularly the last one, are extremely important, as any professional, like the chiropractor St. Leonards, aims to not solely adjust your spine and relieve your neck and back pain, they also have to assist you in achieving an improved wellbeing. Below are some ways that can get you on the said path.

-	Frequent visits to your chiropractor North Sydney are crucial. This is to help your nervous system and spine function well.
-	Following a healthy eating regime will give your body the right amount of nutrients it needs to work and thrive every day.
-	To avoid dehydration and eliminate toxins, drinking plenty of pure water is needed.
-	Working out regularly will also keep your body healthy and in shape. 
-	Get enough rest and sleep, so your body can restore energy.
-	Keeping an optimistic view in everything also helps. 

A proficient North Shore chiropractor should assist you in these processes. The therapy is not going to heal your condition overnight; it will take more than one session, depending on the seriousness of your situation. Also, you will need a continuous treatment to keep your body in top shape.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Python? ==
[[File:Python-logo-notext.svg|175px|right]]
If you don't understand this, don't worry. Just skip it and move on.

Python is an [[w:interpreted programming language|interpreted programming language]]. For those who don't know, a programming language is what you write down to tell a computer what to do. However, the computer doesn't read the language directly—there are hundreds of programming languages, and it couldn't understand them all. So, when someone writes a program, they will write it in their language of choice, and then [[w:compiler|compile]] it—that is, turn it into lots of 0s and 1s, that the computer can easily and quickly understand. A Windows program that you buy is already compiled for Windows—if you opened the program file up, you'd just get a mass of weird characters and rectangles. Give it a go—find a small Windows program, and open it up in Notepad or Wordpad. See what garbled mess you get.

But that Windows program is compiled for Windows—no other machine can run that program, unless it has Windows. What Python is, is a language which is never actually compiled in full—instead, an interpreter turns each line of code into 0s and 1s that your computer can understand. And it is done on the fly—it compiles the bits of the program you are using as you are using them. If you were to quit the program and come back another day, it would compile the bits you are using, as you are using them, again. Seems a waste of time? Maybe, but the fact is that when you come back another day, you might be using a Windows PC instead of a Mac. You might send the program to a friend, who uses another type of computer. Or you might post your program on the internet, where everyone using all different types of systems might download it. That is the wonder of an interpreted programming language—it is like a language that ''everyone'' can understand.

== How to install Python ==
For Python programming you need a working Python installation and a text editor. Python comes with its own editor ''IDLE'', which is quite nice and totally sufficient for the beginning. As you get more into programming, you will probably switch to some other editor like ''emacs'', ''vi'' or another.

The Python download page is [http://www.python.org/download http://www.python.org/download]. The most recent version is 3.3, but any ''Python 2.x'' version since 2.2 will work for this tutorial. Be careful with the upcoming ''Python 3'', though, as some major details will change and break this tutorial's examples. A version of this tutorial for Python 3 is at [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3]]. There are various different installation files for different computer platforms available on the download site. Here are some specific instructions for the most common operating systems:

==== Linux, BSD and Unix users ====
You are probably lucky and Python is already installed on your machine. To test it type &lt;tt&gt;python&lt;/tt&gt; on a command line. If you see something like that in the following section, you are set.

If you have to install Python, just use the operating system's package manager or go to the repository where your packages are available and get Python. Alternatively, you can compile Python from scratch after downloading the source code. If you get the source code make sure you compile in the Tk extension if you want to use IDLE.&lt;!-- Is this realistic for people who don't know how to program??? --&gt;

==== Mac users ====
Starting from Mac OS X (Tiger), Python ships by default with the operating system, but you  might want to update to the newer version (check the version by starting &lt;tt&gt;python&lt;/tt&gt; in a command line terminal). Also IDLE (the Python editor) might be missing in the standard installation. If you want to (re-)install Python, have a look at the [http://www.python.org/download/mac/ Mac page on the Python download site].

==== Windows users ====
Some computer manufacturers pre-install Python. To check if you already have it installed, open command prompt (Windows Key+R and type cmd) or MS-DOS and type python. If it says &quot;Bad command or file name&quot; you will need to download the appropriate Windows installer (the normal one, if you do not have a 64-bit AMD or Intel chip). Start the installer by double-clicking it and follow the procedure.

After installing you will need to add the installation path to the PATH system variable to use it from the command prompt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

OK! We have Python installed, now what? Well, we program!

And it is that simple (at least for now!). Python makes it easy to run single lines of code—one-liner programs. Let's give it a go.

== Opening IDLE ==

Run the program labelled IDLE (Stands for Integrated Development Environment).

Now you are in the IDLE environment. This is the place you will be spending most time in. Here you can open a new window to write a program, or you can simply mess around with single lines of code, which is what we are going to do. Type the following and press enter (don't type '&gt;&gt;&gt;' as it should already be there but yes in python 3.0 you have to add(&quot; sin to start after using print command and &quot;) for closing or it will show an error message...

;Code Example 1 : Hello, world!

&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)

What happened? You just created a program, that prints the words 'Hello, world'. The IDLE environment that you are in immediately compiles whatever you have typed in. This is useful for testing things, e.g., defining a few variables, and then testing to see if a certain line will work. That will come in a later lesson though.

== Math in Python ==

Now try the following examples. I've given explanations in parentheses.

;Code Example 2 – Maths
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 1
2

&gt;&gt;&gt; 20 + 80
100

&gt;&gt;&gt; 18294 + 449566
467860
(These are additions.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 6 - 5
1
(Subtraction)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 * 5
10
(Multiplication)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 ** 2
25
(Exponentials; e.g., this one is 5 squared)

&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;1 + 2 is an addition&quot;
1 + 2 is an addition
(The print statement, which writes something onscreen. Notice that 1 + 2 is left unevaluated.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;One kilobyte is 2^10 bytes, or&quot;, 2 ** 10, &quot;bytes.&quot;
One kilobyte is 2^10 bytes, or 1024 bytes.
(You can print sums and variables in a sentence.
	The commas separating each section are a way of
	separating clearly different things that you are printing.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 21 / 3
7

&gt;&gt;&gt; 23 / 3
7
(Division; note that Python ignores remainders/decimals.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 23.0 / 3.0
7.666666666666667
(This time, since the numbers are decimals themselves, the answer
	will be a decimal.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 23 % 3
2

&gt;&gt;&gt; 49 % 10
9
(The remainder from a division)
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you see, there is the code, then the result of that code. I then explain them in brackets. These are the basic commands of Python, and what they do. Here is a table to clarify them (because tables look cool, and make you feel smarter ;) ):

Remember that thing called [[w:order of operations|order of operations]] that they taught in maths? Well, it applies in Python, too. Here it is, if you need reminding:

# parentheses ()
# exponents **
# multiplication *, division \, and remainder %
# addition + and subtraction -

== Order of Operations ==

Here are some examples that you might want to try, if you're rusty on this:

;Code Example 3 – Order of operations
&lt;pre lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 2 * 3
7
&gt;&gt;&gt; (1 + 2) * 3
9
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the first example, the computer calculates 2 * 3 first, then adds 1 to it. This is because multiplication has the higher priority (at 3) and addition is below that (at a lowly 4).

In the second example, the computer calculates 1 + 2 first, then multiplies it by 3. This is because parentheses (brackets, like the ones that are surrounding this interluding text ;) ) have the higher priority (at 1), and addition comes in later than that.

Also remember that the math is calculated from left to right, ''unless'' you put in parentheses. The innermost parentheses are calculated first. Watch these examples:

;Code Example 4 – Parentheses
&lt;pre lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 - 40 - 3
-39
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 - (40 - 3)
-33
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the first example, 4 - 40 is calculated,then - 3 is done.

In the second example, 40 - 3 is calculated, then it is subtracted from 4.

== Comments, Please ==

The final thing you'll need to know to move on to multi-line programs is the [[w:comment (computer programming)|comment]]. You should always add comments to code to show others who might be reading your code what you've done and why. Type the following (and yes, the output is shown):

;Code Example 5 – Comments
&lt;pre lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; #I am a comment. Fear my wrath!

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

A comment is a piece of code that is not run. In Python, you make something a comment by putting a hash (#) in front of it. A hash comments everything after it in the line, and nothing before it. So you could type this:

;Code Example 6 – Comment examples
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;food is very nice&quot; #eat me
food is very nice
(A normal output, without the smutty comment,
thank you very much)

&gt;&gt;&gt;# print &quot;food is very nice&quot;

(Nothing happens, because the code was after a comment)

&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;food is very nice&quot; eat me

(You'll get a fairly harmless error message,
because you didn't put your comment after a hash)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Comments are important for adding necessary information for another programmer to read, but not the computer; for example, an explanation of a section of code, saying what it does, or what is wrong with it. You can also comment out bits of code if you don't want them to compile, but can't delete them because you might need them later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Well, we can make one-liner programs. So what? You want to send programs to other people, so that they can use them, without knowing how to write them.

== Editing in Notepad ==

Writing programs in Python to a file is ''very'' easy. Python programs are simply text documents—you can open them up in Notepad (or another [[w:text editor|text editor]]), and have a look at them, just like that. So, go and open Notepad. Type the following:

;Code Example 1 – mary.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#A simple program.
print (&quot;Mary had a little lamb,&quot;)
print (&quot;its fleece was white as snow;&quot;)
print (&quot;and everywhere that Mary went&quot;,)
print (&quot;her lamb was sure to go.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Keep this exactly the same, down to where the commas are placed. Save the file as &lt;tt&gt;mary.py&lt;/tt&gt;—and make sure Notepad doesn't add &lt;tt&gt;.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to the end of the filename (you will have to tell it to save as any file to avoid this). Turn off 'Hide known file extensions' in Windows Explorer, if it makes it easier.

== Using the IDLE environment ==

Now, open up the Python IDLE program (should be in your start menu). Click 'File &gt; Open' and find &lt;tt&gt;mary.py&lt;/tt&gt; and open it. If you can't find &lt;tt&gt;mary.py&lt;/tt&gt;, set the open dialogue to 'Files of type: All Files (*)'. A new window will open, showing the program you just wrote. To run your program, click 'Run &gt; Run Module' (or just press {{key press|F5}}). Your program will now run in the main Python screen (titled 'Python Shell') and will look like this:

;Code Example 2 – &lt;tt&gt;mary.py&lt;/tt&gt; output
&lt;pre&gt;
Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow;
and everywhere that Mary went her lamb was sure to go.
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also use IDLE to create Python programs, like what you did in Notepad. Simply click 'File &gt; New'. We will be writing all of our programs now in the Python IDLE program—the Notepad thing is just a demonstration to tell you that a &lt;tt&gt;.py&lt;/tt&gt; file is just a simple text file, which anyone can see.

There are a couple of things to notice here:

First of all, the comment wasn't shown. That is good, because remember—comments aren't compiled. (Try compiling it after removing the #—it comes out messy.)

Second, is that the 3rd and 4th line got joined. This is because there is a comma just outside the inverted commas that surround the text. In the &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; command, this stops the program from starting a new line on the screen when showing text.

You can also run the program from your command line program (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;cmd&lt;/tt&gt;). Open the prompt up, type &lt;code&gt;cd path\to\your\file&lt;/code&gt; then type &lt;code&gt;python mary.py&lt;/code&gt;. Your program will now execute in the command line.

== Variables ==

Now let's start introducing variables. Variables store a value, that can be looked at or changed at a later time. Let's make a program that uses variables. Open up IDLE and click 'File &gt; New Window'. A new window now appears, and it is easy to type in programs. Type the following (or just copy and paste—just read very carefully, and compare the code to the output that the program will make):

;Code Example 3 – Variables
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Variables demonstrated
print &quot;This program is a demo of variables.&quot;
v = 1
print &quot;The value of v is now&quot;, v
v = v + 1
print &quot;v now equals itself plus one, making it worth&quot;, v
v = 51
print &quot;v can store any numerical value, to be used elsewhere.&quot;
print &quot;For example, in a sentence. v is now worth&quot;, v
print &quot;v times 5 equals&quot;, v * 5
print &quot;But v still only remains&quot;, v
print &quot;To make v five times bigger, you would have to type v = v * 5&quot;
v = v * 5
print &quot;There you go, now v equals&quot;, v, &quot;and not&quot;, v / 5
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that if you just want to modify a variable's value with respect to itself, there are shortcuts. These are called [[w:augmented assignment|augmented assignment operators]]:

{| width=40% border=1
  |+ Table 1 – Augmented operators
|-
  ! Standard form
  ! Augmented
|-
|v = v + 5
|v += 5
|-
|v = v - 5
|v -= 5
|-
|v = v * 5
|v *= 5
|-
|v = v / 5
|v /= 5
|}

== Strings ==

As you can see, variables store values, for use at a later time. You can change them at any time. You can put in more than numbers, though. Variables can hold things like text. A variable that holds text is called a string. Try this program:

;Code Example 4 – Strings
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Giving variables text, and adding text.
word1 = &quot;Good&quot;
word2 = &quot;morning&quot;
word3 = &quot;to you too!&quot;
print word1, word2
sentence = word1 + &quot; &quot; + word2 + &quot; &quot; + word3
print sentence
&lt;/source&gt;

The output will be:

;Code Example 5 – String output
&lt;pre&gt;
Good morning
Good morning to you too!
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you see, the variables above were holding text. Variable names can also be longer than one letter—here, we had word1, word2, and word3. As you can also see, strings can be added together to make longer words or sentences. However, spaces aren't added in between the words—hence me putting in the &quot; &quot; things (there is one space between those).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{rfd}}

The queen, at home, went in front of the glass and said:

&quot;Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?&quot;
Then it answered as before:

&quot;Well, you are fairest of all I see,
But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,
Snow-white is still alive and well,
And none is so fair as she.&quot;
When she heard the glass speak like that she trembled and shook with rage. &quot;Snow-white shall die,&quot; she cried, &quot;even if it costs me my life!&quot;

Then she went into a quite secret, lonely room where no one ever came, and made a very poisonous apple. Outside it looked pretty white with a red cheek, but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die.

When the apple was ready, she painted her face and dressed herself up as a country-woman. Then she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs again and knocked at the door. Snow-white put her head out of the window and said, &quot;I cannot let anyone in; the seven dwarfs have forbidden me to do so.&quot;

&quot;It's all the same to me,&quot; answered the woman, &quot;I shall soon get rid of my apples. There, I'll give you one.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Snow-white, &quot;I dare not take anything.&quot;

&quot;Are you afraid of poison?&quot; said the old woman; &quot;look, I will cut the apple in two pieces; you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.&quot;

The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned. Snow-white longed for the fine apple, and when she saw that the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer. She stretched out her hand and took the poisonous half. But hardly had she got a bit of it in her mouth than she fell down dead. Then the queen looked at her with a dreadful look, laughed aloud and said, &quot;White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood! this time the dwarfs cannot wake you up.&quot;

And when she asked of the looking-glass at home:

&quot;Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?&quot;
it answered at last:

&quot;Hm, in this land you are still the fairest of all
As long as it lasts.
But age is wont to take its toll, you know.&quot;
Then her envious heart had slightly more rest.

The dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found Snow-white lying on the ground, without breathing, as far as they could tell. They lifted her up, looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous, unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but it was all of no use; the poor child lay still and unmoving. They laid her on a bier, and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept two days long.

She still looked as if she was alive, and still had her pretty red cheeks, so they said, &quot;We cannot bury her in the dark ground.&quot; So they had a transparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from all sides. There were many small, round holes in the coffin too, just in case Snow-white was alive. They had been mistaken many times before already. Then they laid Snow-white in it and wrote her name on it in golden letters, and that she was a king's daughter. They put the coffin out on the mountain, and one of them was to stay by it and keep guard. Birds came too and wept for Snow-white; first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.

Now Snow-white lay for many hours in the glass coffin. She did not change, but looked as if she were asleep - as white as snow, as red as blood, and with hair as black as ebony.

 (***start rewrite***)

Now a king's son came into the forest. He saw the coffin on the mountain, and the beautiful Snow-white within it, and read what was written on it in golden letters. Then he said to the dwarf who stood on guard, &quot;Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it.&quot;

The guardian dwarf summoned the others, and they answered, &quot;We will not part with it for all the gold in the world.&quot;

Then he said, &quot;Let me have it as a gift, then, for I cannot live without seeing Snow-white. I will honour and prize her.&quot;

As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity on him, and gave him the coffin. Now the king's son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. As they walked along with it, they chanced to stumble over a tree-stump and lose the coffin on the ground. The thump made the poisonous piece of apple that Snow-white had bitten off come out of her throat. Before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was alive!

&quot;Oh, heavens, where am I?&quot; she cried. The king's son, full of joy, said, &quot;You are with me.&quot; He told her what had happened, and said, &quot;I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my father's palace and be my wife.&quot;

Snow-white was willing and went with him, and their wedding was held with great show and splendour. Snow-white's wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast. When she had arrayed herself in beautiful clothes she went before the looking-glass, and said:

&quot;Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?&quot;
The glass answered:

&quot;Well, queen, of all here the fairest you are,
But the young queen is fairer by far.&quot;
Then the wicked woman cursed and was so wretched that she did not know what to do. At first she would not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and must go to see the young queen. When she went in she saw it was Snow-white; and the queen stood still with rage and fear and could not stir. But iron slippers were brought in and set before her. She was forced to put them on and dance and dance. She got so embarrassed of the iron footwear that she dropped dead.</text>

Made a few edits
*Wasn't sure why there were two sections (&quot;Pricing complements generally&quot; and &quot;Prices of zero, or negative&quot;), so I deleted these. 
*Made some formatting fixes.
*Why no mention of 3rd degree price discrimination, or market segmentation, in the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Monopoly&amp;action=submit#Price_discrimination Price discrimination] section?
*Some words (such as Marginal Cost) were arbitrarily capitalized, while other words that should have been capitalized weren't (windows 7, etc).
*There should not be spaces between a parenthesis symbol and the text inside it, like &quot;( Bell Telephone)&quot;.
*Be careful when you mention that consumers do not benefit from price discrimination. In some instances groups of consumers are better off than they would have been with a uniform price. I wouldn't say it &quot;only&quot; benefits the seller, although it probably does ''most'' of the time.

== Knowledge Advantage ==
In that section if mentions 3 major causes for the thwart monopoly formation. Patents, Intellectual property law may serve to strategically prevent (if not issued or respected) or enable monopolistic practices, mostly it enables since a patent provides the right to exclude others.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:56, 28 April 2012 (UTC)

== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Monopoly&amp;diff=2314360&amp;oldid=2314355 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* ''&quot;a business has the market power to set any price it wants for a certain product&quot;''--This is an overly strong statement. A monopolist is not a price-taker, but it doesn't have the ability to set &quot;any price it wants&quot;, at least not if it wants to sell anything.
* ''Natural monopoly''--The formalities and graph are very good, and should definitely stay, but a little more story to go with them would be good. Just ''a little'', and as long as this is a book on information economics, making the story about some kind of information good would make sense.
* ''Government monopolies''--There are other kinds of monopolies which are ''government granted'' monopolies, where the government gives a person or organization monopoly rights, but the government itself does not hold the monopoly. For the purposes of this book, these government-granted monopolies are probably more important than the other kind of government monopoly. For instance, intellectual property (including ''both patents and copyrights'') is a government-granted monopoly (for our purposes, we should ignore trademarks, though).
* ''Knowledge advantage''--This section doesn't talk about what it's header says it will talk about!
* ''Mergers and acquisitions''--This is probably tangential to the focus of this textbook. Unless it can be made more directly applicable, it's a distraction which should be cut out.
* ''Monopoly pricing''--This section should be much more developed. In fact, it probably should be the main part of the page.
** ''MR = MC''--Remember that this is true of monopolists, but also of firms in competitive markets, so that doesn't help unless it's elaborated on. What's different than in a competitive market?
** Graphics would help tremendously for all this.
** Definitely this should include the calculus and formal analysis of a monopolist maximizing profit.
** What about elasticity conditions for maximizing monopoly profit?
** While it's interesting to think about various marginal-cost shapes in general, for the focus of this text, it might be worthwhile to stick to constant marginal cost.
* ''Price discrimination''--This is interesting, but doesn't quite fit into this page, since this page is &quot;background&quot;. I've moved [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Price_Discrimination|price discrimination to its own page]] where it needs cleanup.
* ''Penetration pricing'' and ''Pricing both sides of two-sided platform''--I ''have not'' moved these, but ideally they should be moved, I'm just not positive where to. Possibly the best thing to do is develop them further here and move them later. If so, they need to be developed with a great deal more detail. We have not covered the detail for pricing both sides of a two-sided platform (but if you'd like to do the research to fill it in, that's great). We have covered the detail for penetration pricing.
** ''&quot;after time passes and demand increases&quot;'' remember there's a difference between demand increasing and quantity demanded increasing, and that holds here as well. This should be phrased in terms of what equilibrium the market is going to not &quot;demand increases&quot;.
** ''&quot;the optimal level''&quot;--What does &quot;optimal&quot; mean?
** ''&quot;When a company does this, their competitors may fail because they cannot keep up the with low prices they are charging.&quot;''--No, that's [[w:predatory pricing|predatory pricing]]
** ''&quot;use the product and hopefully market it''&quot;--why is the company hoping the customers will market the product? I think this is mis-phrased.
** ''&quot;sure that the product or service is elastic enough''&quot;--elasticity isn't the best way to think about this.
** The second paragraph (disadvatnages) of the penetration pricing section seems like speculation. All of that could be argued with unless it's referenced or more carefully analyzed.
** The fourth and fifth paragraphs (on discount stores and hook-bait) don't really match what we mean when we talk about penetration pricing. They probably should come out.
** The section on pricing for two-sided platforms is understandably sparse, since we haven't covered that much and it's not in your book. However, it's a little bit wrong right now. I'm not sure how to recommend making it right, except doing more research on it. Otherwise, it can be pulled out and wait for someone else (possibly me) to fill it in later.
[[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 03:29, 29 April 2012 (UTC)
* ''References''--Most of the three references currently in the article aren't good enough. &quot;fundamentalfinance.com&quot; and &quot;digitaleconomist.org&quot; both appear to be blogs (albeit sophisticated ones). About.com is not an adequate source, it should be treated like a blog or Wikipedia. The reference to ATT is worthwhile for it's limited use.[[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 03:43, 29 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

== Proposal for making interwiki links a different color ==

I am restating this proposal here in a clearer way at the suggestion of [[User:Panic2k4]].

The proposal is to make links on Wikibooks to other Wikimedia projects (notably Wikipedia) a (slightly) different color then internal links, in much the same way as links you have already followed look different then links to pages you haven't visited. My original proposal was this:

{{hidden|header=Original proposal (click to show)|headerstyle=background:#ccccff|content= {{quote|
I have noticed that quite a lot of [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] use links to [[Wikipedia]] regularly. At the same time however, they link to other [[m:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] and other chapters of the same book. It is, of course, impossible to tell wether the link is internal, to another book, or to [[commons:category:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] without clicking on it or hovering over it. This can be extremely bothersome to a reader, who may want to read a Wikibook or chapter on the subject, but not a Wikipedia article. The reader can not tell until he or she has clicked on it where it is going. An example from [[C++ Programming]]:

{{quote|[[w:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup]], a Computer Scientist from [[w:Bell Labs|Bell Labs]], was the designer and original implementer of '''C++''' (originally named &quot;C with Classes&quot;) during the 1980s as an enhancement to the [[Subject:C programming language|C programming language]]. Enhancements started with the addition [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms#Object-oriented_programming|object-oriented]] concepts like [[C++ Programming/Classes|classes]], followed by, among many features, [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Polymorphism|virtual functions]], [[C++ Programming/Operators/Operator Overloading|operator overloading]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Inheritance|multiple inheritance]], [[C++ Programming/Templates|templates]], and [[C++ Programming/Exception Handling|exception handling]]. These and other features are covered in detail along this book.}}

The first two links link to Wikipedia pages, the second links to a Wikibooks subject page, and the rest link to other chapters of the same book. Wikipedia links are useful, of course, because they can link to related pages that the Wikibook does not deal with. For example, a Wikibook about the French language may say that French is also spoken in Monaco, but a reader might like to know where Monaco is and the book does not want to waste time explaining it, as it is not directly relevant. A link to Wikipedia becomes very useful in cases like this. But Wikibooks should try not to rely on Wikipedia too much, and so a link to it should appear different than one to a chapter within the Wikibook or another Wikibook. After all, books should be encased within themselves and not need to rely on the explanation of an encyclopedia or another book. Can you imagine how annoying it would be to have a math text book that makes you go look up what a quadratic function is? 

So my proposal here is to use the project-wide CSS page to make ''all links to other projects look different'' than inter-chapter and inter-book links. This could be done with a slightly different color or font, or something similar to (but different than) the way external links appear (with the arrow thing like this - [http://www.wikibooks.org external link]). 

This would really facilitate the reading experience, and make this project less dependent on Wikipedia. After all, Wikibooks [[WB:NOTWP|is not an encylopedia]], and so does not have to conform to the formatting standards of Wikipedia. [[User:Liam987|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;border:1px solid;background:#0055A4;text-shadow:0 5px 8px #850000&quot;&gt;Liam987]]&lt;/span&gt;''' 14:31, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
}}}}

My reasons for proposing this are explained in there. The exact color of the links would have to be decided based on readability and the effect on color blind people. I would suggest #336600 &lt;span style=&quot;background:#336600&quot;&gt;{{spaces|5}}&lt;/span&gt; ([[w:|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#336600;&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;]]) or #808000 &lt;span style=&quot;background:#808000&quot;&gt;{{spaces|5}}&lt;/span&gt; ([[w:|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;]]). Another shade of blue may be better, though. [[User:Liam987|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;border:1px solid;background:#0055A4;text-shadow:0 5px 8px #850000&quot;&gt;Liam987]]&lt;/span&gt;''' 07:24, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
:My comment is that wikipedia does not typically use plain links for any site outside of the project itself. They make it known that you are leaving their site by using things like &quot;Related media on Wikimedia Commons.&quot; and so on. Wikisource has adopted the same practice, in that most links ''only'' link internally to wikisource. Maybe it might be better to leave all interwiki links in a &quot;Further reading&quot; section or something? - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 10:18, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

::Wikipedia is an encyclopedia it would defeat its purpose to rely on other sources to explain the subject matter on Wikisource the issue is probably resumed by most content not being wiki formated on the source material and intended to be static (not open to improvements).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:24, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

::Wikibooks also has and uses templates that let the reader know they are leaving the website ({{tl|wikipedia}} for example). I think Wikibooks best practice is already considered to only list external links in a further reading page or to make use of templates that distinctly separate an external link from the content, just as Wikipedia either uses templates or places external links in either a see also, references or external links section.
:: I think inline templates can just as easily be made and used in books where the contributors want to make a distinction in some other way like with color differences or adding an icon after the link. Other options include the use of the per-book stylesheet to effect just one book, make a Gadget so the choice is up to people, or make use of the personal stylesheet at [[Special:MyPage/common.css]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:13, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:I do not support nor object the proposal (because I do not see it as necessary my browser does all the differentiation I require). I only ask that the changes take in account the themes colors and mobility of content and do not become too prominent.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:24, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
::I too am not too concerned about whichever route this takes, and wouldnt stand in the way of those who wish to have it stylized this way. However, I think the colors might be confusing; sister sites plus internal would mean 9 Wikimedia links, and thus, 9 different colors. Wikipedia would be the most often linked, but I could easily imagine someone linking to wiktionary, wikisource and commons almost as easily, just less frequent. 
::The purpose (I believe) is to let users simply know when they are leaving, but a green or grey link on a wikibook may not convey that until learned or explained somewhere prior. Using an icon after the word works well in that it keeps the color scheme the same and can let someone know where they are going because of it, but it also assumes that they know our icons.

== Wikipedia links ==

I have noticed that quite a lot of [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] use links to [[Wikipedia]] regularly. At the same time however, they link to other [[m:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] and other chapters of the same book. It is, of course, impossible to tell wether the link is internal, to another book, or to [[commons:category:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] without clicking on it or hovering over it. This can be extremely bothersome to a reader, who may want to read a Wikibook or chapter on the subject, but not a Wikipedia article. The reader can not tell until he or she has clicked on it where it is going. An example from [[C++ Programming]]:

{{quote|[[w:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup]], a Computer Scientist from [[w:Bell Labs|Bell Labs]], was the designer and original implementer of '''C++''' (originally named &quot;C with Classes&quot;) during the 1980s as an enhancement to the [[Subject:C programming language|C programming language]]. Enhancements started with the addition [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms#Object-oriented_programming|object-oriented]] concepts like [[C++ Programming/Classes|classes]], followed by, among many features, [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Polymorphism|virtual functions]], [[C++ Programming/Operators/Operator Overloading|operator overloading]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Inheritance|multiple inheritance]], [[C++ Programming/Templates|templates]], and [[C++ Programming/Exception Handling|exception handling]]. These and other features are covered in detail along this book.}}

The first two links link to Wikipedia pages, the second links to a Wikibooks subject page, and the rest link to other chapters of the same book. Wikipedia links are useful, of course, because they can link to related pages that the Wikibook does not deal with. For example, a Wikibook about the French language may say that French is also spoken in Monaco, but a reader might like to know where Monaco is and the book does not want to waste time explaining it, as it is not directly relevant. A link to Wikipedia becomes very useful in cases like this. But Wikibooks should try not to rely on Wikipedia too much, and so a link to it should appear different than one to a chapter within the Wikibook or another Wikibook. After all, books should be encased within themselves and not need to rely on the explanation of an encyclopedia or another book. Can you imagine how annoying it would be to have a math text book that makes you go look up what a quadratic function is? 

So my proposal here is to use the project-wide CSS page to make ''all links to other projects look different'' than inter-chapter and inter-book links. This could be done with a slightly different color or font, or something similar to (but different than) the way external links appear (with the arrow thing like this - [http://www.wikibooks.org external link]). 

This would really facilitate the reading experience, and make this project less dependent on Wikipedia. After all, Wikibooks [[WB:NOTWP|is not an encylopedia]], and so does not have to conform to the formatting standards of Wikipedia.

:I'm certainly no css expert, but I wondered if you could actually do that.

:: The body tag has a class that varies by namespace to allow styling to depend on the namespace of a page.

::Possibly, then, a variant of the external link arrow ([http://en.wikibooks.org like this]) that appears next to the external link. Is that possible?

::: I don't think this will help reduce at all the visual clutter, most pages here are edited by a single editor and those rarely have that issue but in project with a few editors or in works that use tranwiki culling down the replication is extremely hard another issue is that works can become extremely extensive and when fragmenting the page in smaller sections what was a duplication becomes a useful link again, this and the high volatility of any wiki content makes delimiting visual clutter from useful metadata an extremely hard task...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:38, 30 March 2012 (UTC)

:: As well as the browser status bar (or similar) the links already are formatted in a subtly different shade of blue (on Vector, no custom CSS) - the link to [[w:Bell Labs|Bell Labs]] is colour 3366bb, while the link to [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Inheritance|multiple inheritance]] is 0645ad.  This is done using CSS, and Vector is the default skin, isn't it?

:::Another alternative would be relax the auto-promotion of reviewers and attribute it to the Autoreviewed user and start requiring a formal request for reviewers (more or less what QU proposes without the simple administrative nod), in that case reviewers after 1 year in the project should be auto-tapped (well admins will have to do it) for the flag of admin (a good alternative location to process the removal of the review flag if the user is inactive). This is something that was lost since people stopped doing the old vandalizing patrol, bulk RfDs (or similar tasks) to get acknowledgment from the active community for a nomination.

:::: Do you perceive that it's too ''easy'' to get the Reviewer bit?  I don't.  Nor do I think the current autopromotion criteria particularly far off, in either direction; I doubt any appropriate adjustment would be large enough to be worth the trouble of effecting it.  I do think we get too many requests for manual granting of Reviewer as it is, and my instinct is, no good would come of routinely substituting individual admin judgement for autopromotion.

:::: As I remarked earlier, I see no point in granting Autoreviewed to someone we wouldn't grant Reviewer to (automatically or otherwise), and therefore no point in having Autoreviewed as a separate group.  I'd add, I see no benefit in removing Reviewer for inactivity (though I also suspect it wouldn't be at all easy to make that happen automatically).

::::: My understanding is that auto-reviewed user only gets the pages the he works on reviewed (I expect at the lowest degree, that doesn't seem to have been made clear above). Auto-reviewers (I believe) will not be able to do rollback. So they seem distinct enough, trusting someone to have his edits reviewed automatically is not the same as letting him review the edits of others (less chance of making mistakes or having an impact on the project, especially with the sneaky vandalism that I see increasing, as I have already pointed out). Isn't there also a benefit in having bots use the flag in place of the reviewer (with rights that they should not use) ?
::::: I perceive that the requirements for reviewer are OK, if it was up to me I would only increase the «10 or more unique pages are edited ''at least'' once» to at least the double. With auto-reviewed users the requests for reviewer will surely decrease (by history of the requests made). The requests for reviewer are also affected by &quot;us&quot; being permissive in providing shortcuts to the agreed requirements.
::::: I was thinking because of a recent edit by Adrignola on one page of the &quot;validated&quot; groups that is a duplication (and is not used), do we have a groups specifically for users that have the emails verified ?

::::A couple of points here - the idea of simplicity seems sensible - i.e. not having an extra set of rights just for the sake of it.  As proposed above, with a similar but slightly smaller set of requirements to Reviewer, this doesn't seem all that useful - OK, I'd probably have autoreview by now, which would be nice as a lot of my edits are awaiting review, but as we present the latest version by default that's not so bad.  A question though - that number of unique pages criterion (I presume &quot;pages&quot; in this context refers to subpages e.g. an edit to each of [[LaTeX/Mathematics]] and [[LaTeX/Advanced Mathematics]] would count as 2 pages) may be onerous for someone working on a small book, who could potentially have a lot to contribute - would the aim of this proposal be to make it easier for them? I'm not sure of the background behind this criterion - it seems to discriminate against someone who works hard with attention to the details of a small group of pages, a useful contribution.

Will the auto-reviewed group automatically reviewed edits have a minimal quality review ? Since it was automatically added to bots will it signify that bots will now upon editing a page that was previously non-reviewed get the reviewed status by the bot actions ? If so why have the bots been granted the flag without any discussion or at least without some more time to ponder the implications, who made the decision for the community ?   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:28, 21 March 2012 (UTC)
: Afaik:  The software can be configured to select which usergroups will have the autosight property.  The autosight property is presumably the only property associated with the autoreview group, and is one of the properties associated with the bot and pseudo-bot groups.  Autosight means that '''if''' the current revision of the page is sighted, the new revision will be too.  The new revision will '''not''' be sighted if the preexisting revision wasn't itself already sighted.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 14:31, 21 March 2012 (UTC)

:::I think this proposal makes a lot of sense. Just an idea, but what if this was implemented for ''just specific books''? What I mean is, what if a user could be granted autoreviewed rights for individual books, but not Wikibooks as a whole. For example, a user who had been shown to have a clear knowledge of C programming and who had made good edits to the [[C Programming]] book could have their edits to ''just that book'' autoreviewed, but not there edits to other books. This may be overly complicated, and I don't know how that would be implemented, but I think it would be good. A lot of people come to Wikibooks ''just to right one book'', and this would make it much easier for them, while not endangering the whole project with vandalism.

::::This seems like it would be a good idea if feasible, however I would hope that an editor who could be trusted with autoreview on one book would not vandalise another (especially as wikibooks has less politically sensitive content than some other projects) - misguided edits going against the aims of a book (e.g. adding lots of very basic material to an advanced text or vice versa) may still be an issue.

The admins in general aren't wary of granting the right - we can always take it away again - as it is always obvious if someone is a vandal or not. We're also allowed to grant it on request. The issue is rather that some members of the community feel that editors should wait for the autopromote and so we respect their opinion and refrain frome exercising our &quot;right&quot; to grant the flag except for cases where it really isn't possible for the editor to be auto-promoted.

So just to &lt;s&gt;resume&lt;/s&gt; summarize and restate what we have discussed and help reformulate the proposal.&lt;br&gt;
This discussion of the proposal seems to:&lt;br&gt;
a) Auto-reviewed user right have a useful function and their implementation, the primary subject of the discussion, seems to have no lingering opposition.&lt;br&gt;
b) There is a strong support of moving auto-reviewer flag to a relaxed auto-promotion system as a way to solve the major reason some Wikibookians request prematurely the reviewer right, since there has not ever been a request focusing in the rest of the functions available to reviewers.&lt;br&gt;
c) The relaxation of requirements and attribution of auto-reviewer permits an alteration of the requirements for the auto-promotion for reviewer that can reflects more the multiple project activity and permanency on the project (for instance an auto-reviewer may not have a registered email). My conclusion  from the discussion.&lt;br&gt;
Some questions must still be examined. Will auto-reviewer be able to change the review status of edits (like the reviewer can select that the edit be made as reviewed can an auto-reviewer change force it to un-reviewed ? (it seems contradictory but forcing edits to keep the previous status may be seen as forcing a level of quality on the Wikibookian, of course this can be counterbalanced by reseting of the flag in errors are detected, but in that case can the reset be made as to put the Wikibookians again in the auto-reviewer group ?&lt;br&gt;
What alterations or requirements should be set to auto-reviewers and reviewers auto-promotions ?
Unrelated to the proposal but a question based on what was previously said. Since bots got the auto-reviewer flag does the CommonsDelinker bot have it on (it seems not)?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:23, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

: Huh?  You appear to me to be describing a consensus that does not exist.  We don't seem to have actually resolved anything; various ideas have been tossed about.

: a) Nothing said here has made me think autoreviewer useful.  I haven't been repeating myself ''much'', though looking back I see I did a little.  I made it clear my assessment hadn't changed; I thought it would be understood thereafter that it would continue to not have changed unless I said it ''had'' changed.

: b) I did observe that some newcomers misperceive that they are somehow inconvenienced by not getting the bit earlier.  If we could, say, cause them to not see the 'pending' status until they get the reviewer right, that would probably help.  But I don't consider their misperceptions a justification for a watered-down autoreviewer right.

::Again I'm not claiming consensus only my read of the discussion so far as a &lt;s&gt;resume&lt;/s&gt; summarize. You are free to object to it (that was the purpose) but please clarify your objection if not already addressed as I thought they were. Did you read about the bots, does it not seem a good thing to have that possibility? Are you really backing the view that the group should be removed ?&lt;br&gt;
::Since there is still not auto-reviewer right and an auto-promotion to water down, are you talking the reviewer right? I have indeed proposed and been supported to relaxing some of the aspects of the reviewer (and opened the possibly of increase other requirements), since that group would become more specialized in its quality control and rollback capabilities (auto-reviewer would, depending on the answers to the questions I make, reduce the repetitive task of validating the  edits of safer contributors).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:21, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

::: Well, no, you ''did'' claim consensus: &quot;no lingering objections&quot;, &quot;strong support&quot;.  Not worth a big meta-argument, but, just pointing this out.

::: Bots have nothing to do with this.  You seem to have misunderstood something about bots, but I'm not sure what.

::: If reviewer became more specialized, it ought if anything to have ''stricter'' requirements; but I stated at the outset why I didn't see a useful purpose in having an autoreviewer right separate from reviewer, and I've seen nothing said that invalidates that reasoning.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 06:29, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

:::: I attempt to be clear and am very sorry if you misunderstood me. To me a call for consensus only made sense if the issue was fully publicized since it constitutes a high impact decisions. For instance it may impact bot actions and operators should be aware of the decision, and why I was surprised when I found you still objection of keeping the new user group (not the initial proposal by QU), since to me the new flag is indisputable useful in that function.
:::: One thing that may have indeed escaped me, and that I now realize is a possibility, is that the user group and flag may not be interlinked (this depends on how Wikimedia implements things and I confess to not have any experience or knowledge about that subject) since the flag and function may still be attributed without a specific access group. Now that I think about it and looking to the existing usergroups makes perfect sense, but then the discussion was going in reverse. Is this deduction correct ? Can bots still get the flag even if the access group is removed ?
:::: The initial proposal by QU was about the use of the new user group and its attribution process, then Adrignola raised the option to remove the new user group (to me in reverse, since there was no consensus for the adoption, the correct approach would have been to gather consensus for keeping it). This would also reinforce your position of objection.
:::: Disregarding any confusion on my part since it only decreases some of the importance I was giving to the group existence, there seems to be support for keeping the new groups and restructure the auto-promotions around it so as to have those actively contributing to stop getting the pages set to un-reviewed (and having the community validating simple edits by these active editors, that by continuing on that pat will get auto-promoted to reviewer) as several Wikibookians stated that to be somewhat demoralizing (even for those reviewing, for instance I'm incapable of quickly examining alterations to source code or formulas if the edit is not in a continued block, meaning I rarely do it). As for what changes to the reviewer I have expressed myself badly as I state on my post from (23:14, 24 February) I intended to state that auto-reviewers should be auto-promoted with a relaxed auto-promoting setting equal to the existing reviewer.     
:::: Since you are still objecting to the new user group existence then it becomes a moot point unless you see the above expressed remarks and take the historical points raised by those attempting to bypass the automation in consideration and change your position. I see some benefits and support the move. I point to you that you may lack the right perspective unless you did not have the flag and intended to do a large number of edits.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:44, 6 April 2012 (UTC)
:::: I also took the chance to look into the page review logs and you seem not to me amongst the most active reviewers (at least on the last 5k reviews) that also may explain some lack of understanding and probably one of the factors that prompted QU request for community approval for the attribution (since he does a lot of reviews).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 10:19, 6 April 2012 (UTC)
&lt;!--- add above this line--&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

&lt;s&gt;
As to resume the discussion, now extremely long of the primary proposal that has suffered several changes, themselves independent proposals that retroactively would affect the principal.&lt;br&gt;
In accordance to what was previous discussed (read above), the first item that needs consensus is if the new &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; access group (see [[Special:ListGroupRights]] for the permissions ), should be adopted on Wikibooks (answering the issue raised by Adrignola above). Because this would alter the rest of the proposals and so this item is given primacy.&lt;br&gt;
Maintaining &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; access group would permit a distinct access group whose edits will not change the review status of a page and no access to the rollback function of the reviewer groups.&lt;br&gt;
As to address the issues discussed and close or continue addressing the dependent proposals, the community is therefore called to express opposition to keeping the &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; access group. This discussion will last for &lt;u&gt;7 days after the last post on this thread&lt;/u&gt;. '''No opposition (or their restatement) will mean keeping the &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; access group'''. The group will then have the community's support and we will proceed in giving it a function (as previously discussed) and the necessary requirements for attribution (the primary primary proposal by QuiteUnusual).&lt;br&gt;
Please attempt to focus only on the specific topic and/or the viability of alternative approaches that would resolve most of the problems the community feels that having pages showing a pending reviewed status seems to cause. It would not only be welcomed but necessary to understand the real possibility of such solutions and how they may impact the use of the group.&lt;br&gt;
Any issues not related with the discussion of this item, I (and I believe others) will gladly address on our own talk pages (but please read the previous posts above first).&lt;/s&gt;  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:40, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt;
Since no opposition was expressed we shall consider the existing [[Special:ListGroupRights]] validated by the community, a concern raised by Adrignola (the creation of the user group in itself is not specifically a high-impact decision but the next points regarding function and attribution will need to be properly announced).&lt;br&gt;
We will now  move on to the next point on the table regarding what use shall be given to the new usergroups. As advanced in the previous discussion some voiced opinions in defense of giving use to the &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; usergroups as a stepping stone to reviewers and to better characterize the community confidence in those that do contribute content but do not wish to be auto-confirmed. That is we recognize a confidence that the content contributed is safe and within our project definitions and changes made by those users do not require a third person verification.&lt;br&gt;
This of course permits to auto-promote to  &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; probably using a relaxed criteria based on what is now used for [[Wikibooks:Reviewers]] but this is not in discussion for now as there may be other proposal regarding the group function to be expressed.&lt;br&gt;
This discussion will last for &lt;u&gt;7 days after the last post on this thread&lt;/u&gt;. '''No opposition (or their restatement) will mean using the &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; access group as an intermediary access group in relation to the Reviewers''' (as proposed by myself). This is a discussion regarding appropriate function not the criteria granting &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot;, if you have a better/different function for the usergroup put it forward.&lt;/s&gt;  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:22, 30 April 2012 (UTC)

: Panic, historically I have worked '''very''' hard at being polite in discussions, but, operating in that mode, it seems some messages here haven't been getting through to you.

: Your strategy here seems to be to flood the thread with words until everyone is sick of the thread and boycotts it, and then claim that what you want has &quot;consensus&quot;.  Seems like you may even have ''twice'' presented a biased &quot;summary&quot; of what had come before and then claimed consensus (I haven't got the stomach to go back to check exactly how it went down before).  This is &amp;mdash;sorry&amp;mdash; bullshit.  I see no consensus here, except perhaps consensus that this thread is no longer useful, that consensus being expressed by people staying away from the thread.  I hadn't even noticed the &quot;unless there is opposition within seven days&quot; clause you'd unilaterally imposed, until just now.  (Wait, didn't I say something earlier about assuming my position was unchanged until-and-unless I retracted it?  Wouldn't that mean that the opposition you wanted within seven days ''already existed at the start of the seven days''?  I'm not even going to go wading back through this to find out exactly what who said when.  You can likely produce these claims far, far more easily than anyone could possibly work out exactly which of your words are specifically false.

::I agree that I shouldn't have been the one calling the consensus on the previous stage but, things need to be resolved toward a conclusion (initiated in 24 February).

There are books written mainly by 1 or several authors. These authors normally create an 'authors' page for their book and put their names there. But how can it be sure that this page is protected? In other words, how can these main authors keep their names credited?

I suggest we should have another namespace, call it 'Author' or something like that, together with namespace 'Main' and 'Talk'. Pages of this namespace should be protected, only administrators or ones with enough privilege can edit. Once having enough evidence, the administrator can list the main authors of that book on the page. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/123.21.198.153|123.21.198.153]] ([[User talk:123.21.198.153|discuss]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt;

:You'd be best advised to suggest this at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals]], so that others can voice their opinions on it.

::Hi Adrignola, I understand what you mean. Normally, the authors make a subpage named 'Authors' to their book and put its link in the first page (for example, in the Table of Contents). Of course the first page of that book is not protected, so anyone can ''delete'' that link (delete a link, not a page), make a new subpage and link to that! A new namespace next to the Talk namespace of the book can achieve 2 goals: its 'link' to the book can not be deleted, and its content can not be changed, until the administrators think there's enough evidence to do so. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/123.21.39.228|123.21.39.228]] ([[User talk:123.21.39.228|discuss]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt;

::: Two thoughts, for what they're worth.
:::* Once a name is (legitimately) on an authors subpage, the same counter-vandalism techniques that suffice elsewhere should suffice there.

Authors subpages are generally less complete, as not all contributors sign the authors page &amp;mdash; even if they contribute significantly; I generally don't, for example, because authors subpages seem to have a mild flavor of ownership about them.

:::: If I had a penny for each time that argument &quot;There is a complete and indelible record of contributors to a book in its pages' revision histories&quot; is thrown around as quick way to address the issue of authorship I would be a very rich man. Edit histories are useful but not by any means a complete, comprehensible and indelible record. I have discussed this endlessly and you as an administrator know that it is a failed argument, it could be hard to make contributions indelible but by intention or by a unforeseeable sequence of mishaps it can happen.
:::: There is a intrinsic usefulness to know those that have rights over the works, the rational is the same for instance on why patents can only be signed by their inventors. There is much to hate around the issue of copyright and intellectual property in general but it is a disservice to all and even a possible reason why the project does not attract more authors the way the issue is constantly dismissed and not properly addressed by Wikimedia. Ultimately only the copyright holders can enforce the licenses and relicense the works, signing one's own work is a mater of responsibility and pride for the work done, that becomes even of primal importance in this intangible medium we use for our creations.

:::: Hi Pi zero, ones editing the book are not necessarily its author, so the revision history has no help. For example, I obtain permission to publish a book from its author, my work is simply copying and reformatting the book so that it appears well on Wikibooks. I am not its author. If I make an author subpage, there's no guarantee that the name of the original author remains unchanged.

As noted on every edit, people must agree that a hyperlink or URL is sufficient attribution. I think attributions in the form of a hyperlink or URL in the bibliography or further reading section of a book should be all that is done. I think all Author pages should then be deleted. I think books must be deleted if the authors of a prior work in which the book is based does not agree that a hyperlink or URL is sufficient attribution. An even stricter interpretation is possible where authors of prior works must agree that a hyperlink or URL back to the book on Wikibooks is sufficient attribution. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:22, 31 March 2012 (UTC)

::''Chiming in like I've been here for awhile''.. Interesting topic, but I think the largest problem with this is that a wikibook can never in theory be completed. This is a stark difference with books here versus a published work appearing at Wikisource, where there is clear attribution. Another problem is determining how much contribution to a book constitutes authorship.

:::Not to mention that the copyright of contributions and over the global work also varies from the origin of the contributor, there are significant differences between jurisdictions. On the project the location of the servers guides the legal requirements for compliance but works are not created only to reside on the server. Books that are usable (even if I fully agree with you that the objective is ultimately toward never-ending perfectionism and mutation), if properly published that version/revision can be moved to Wikisource.
:::As for the how much contribution constitutes authorship is also another interesting subject, I have had several discussions about it in the past, but since there are those that still defend views like Darklama, that I blame Wikimedia because it fails to properly address the subject. I do not think at this time one could properly address it by ourselves. I wonder how does Commons deal with the copyright attribution of derivative works, in particular of works they also hold the &quot;original&quot;...
:::More than  legal matters, these issues are about expectations, the expectations of those contributing to the project.
:::I had a very hard time making clear the distinction between ownership and control, and I fully understand that there is a minority that would like to make all content public domain. But they fail to comprehend that in that way no one can defend the freedom of the content, that is also part of the interests of the authors/copyright holders next to the right of acknowledgment. These people often are not creators themselves or have not a long term view regarding the works, only seeing the works as existing on this project right now. This is something hard to empathize for anyone with vested interest on his/hers creation.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 14:10, 31 March 2012 (UTC)

:: Copyright and license for books is defended by complaining to [[m:OTRS|OTRS]]. I think any work or license is incompatible with Wikibooks if attributions beyond a hyperlink or URL is necessary for text contributions. In the more stricter interpretation any work or license is incompatible with Wikibooks if attribution beyond a hyperlink or URL to the book on Wikibooks for text contributions is necessary. People would probably have to deal with the jurisdiction issues if they tried to defend the copyright and license for books on their own. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:59, 31 March 2012 (UTC)

::: The OTRS serves to protect Wikimedia ([[meta:OTRS/info-en mission]]) not the works and in regards to copyright not even the users (a copyright infringer can be legally persecuted by actions on the Wikimedia projects, Wikimedia has no responsibility and will even be able to provide logs of the activity). In the requirements of attribution, and this is something we already discussed, the works license requires express agreement to it (some defend that a simple click-trough suffices) some like myself doubt this view, especially when using third party content and because of the volatility of not only the identity of users, but of the records themselves. Only copyright holders can relicense their content (USA with exception to Public Domain works). Copyright relinquishing has to be done by writing or terminus of copyright protection (USA).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 15:49, 31 March 2012 (UTC)

This comment is a little unrelated to the last part of this discussion regarding copyright laws, but I'm going to write it anyway:
I think Wikibooks should be clearly attributed to their author(s) on Wikibooks. You can expect people to fix a typo or right something to an encyclopedia without wanting attribution, but a book, even a Wikibook, is different. Writing a book is ''a lot of work'', and many more writers will be attracted to this project if they are attributed on the main page of the book in an obvious way. The point of Wikibooks it to make available books that are free to use and can be edited by anyone. But why shouldn't the writer be attributed, even if he or she does not own the copyright? For that matter, why shouldn't opinionated or non-neutral books be allowed? Wikibooks seems to me to be operating too much on the standards of Wikipedia, i.e. the standards of an encyclopedia.

As long as the authors are attributed in a clear way on the front page, why not have the book express opinions, as long as the book is marked as a non-neutral book and you know who wrote it? A new namespace could even be created calle either &quot;Essay&quot; or &quot;Opinion&quot; or something similar, and leave the main namespace for text books. The main thing I'm saying here is that for people to want to write full-fledged books that they have no control over and do not profit from, this project will have to make some concessions to them (the writers) and give them credit and freedom in writing, and maybe even limited control over the Wikibook they write.

:The issue with having authors signing their work has two main problems. The one that was raised above by the proponent, the lack of protection for the information and the general lack of guidelines from Wikimedia linked to the unpreparedness of the administration to deal with the subject (verify claims, this is also observable when we deal for instance with claims of copyright violations, almost always we put the burden of prof on the contributor not on the copyright holder this is a fragility that can lead to preemptive deletion of valid content, since in case of doubt the path is deletion.) and having the required tools it would be an astronomical mess going through the history logs to verify that information (I think [[User:Robert Horning]] opened a ticked on that). 
:As you stated Wikibooks and Wikipedia are very distinct (the best match is indeed as I think someone said above Wikisource) in this regard, of legal protection of works and authors. But even on Wikipedia the aggregation is copyrightable. I would go as far a stating that some articles go beyond simple factual information and probably also copyrightable, but that is something that is up for that project to handle. In any case I would expect that someone has to be listed as the owner of the rights over the work if not I do not see how they could actively enforce the project licensing...
:On the issue of attribution every contributor the history logs do indeed satisfy it and are easier to maintain accurate (of course it would be extremely interesting to have a better listing of all edits on all pages of a work centralized) and the fact that the work is not simply a result of the authors should be stressed as recognition from all. This distinction is that authors must by legal requirements be listed in the work in whatever medium it is presented (IIRC the GFDL asks for the top 5 and the CCBYSA for 3) and it would be impractical to list all the names/ips of all editors to a work in that case a simply link to the Wikibook project could serve (and in the author pages I created this is done).
:Regarding the changing of the scope of Wikibooks that is a distinct discussion that could be extended in the talk page of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]] policy (this is valid also for the issue of Essays), but I note that non-neutral books can be created and the non-neutrality (POV) can be some what protected by stating it clearly on the scope of the book what and how it will cover the issue.
:I also take the chance to clarify that authors (even Wikimedia and users) can profit from Wikibooks. Authors have a larger degree of freedom since they can relicense the works, this permits to mix other type of content that is not license compatible, for instance an author may start a project on Wikibooks, at a later date use that content and add to it outside of the project (even licensing other content from other copyright holders, for instance photos) and sell it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:22, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

Removing a hyperlink or URL on the author subpage, which links to the original author, clearly infringes Attribution Condition of Creative Commons license. When there are a lot of books on Wikibooks, no one can be sure that those links will be left intact. So we must protect those pages. The best way to do that is creating a new namespace protected by default accompanying with each book. As I mentioned previously, the anti-vandalism tool is not enough, because one could remove the link to the author page (without changing its content), created a new 'author' subpage and then on the book (s)he linked to his/her version. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:113.172.237.128|113.172.237.128]] ([[User talk:113.172.237.128|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/113.172.237.128|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:Not so, the only URL protected is for the copy of the license if not included in the work. Only the name of the author (or pseudonym, if applicable) is required and protected by the license. Note also that there is limitations on the USA law to anonymous authors, that if IIRC have subtle changes from state to state.
:As for the importance of the page and the need for protection of the information I'm in fully agreement with you but think that a namespace is not a realistic solution, maybe pages could be edit protected to the level of auto-reviewer/reviewer (since most people dedicated to a work will get that right sooner or later as they add themselves to the author page they can request the protection) as a side note I think that such author pages as a simple courtesy and recognition for all other collaborators should also link to the book project and point out the history logs.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:22, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

::Clear authorship is an undoubtedly a great way to entice editors, but I am unsure if the dynamics of wikibooks allows for ease of this. A few days ago I noticed a featured book, [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering|Stuttering]] became a subpage of a larger scoped wikibook &quot;project&quot;. Was this the intent of the original author(s), to have their book become essentially a chapter in a larger book? I think that creating an environment which promotes ownership of a given work might be damaging to the &quot;wiki&quot; way of cooperation. But that is just my opinion; don't have any evidence.
::Among the various wikis I've worked at, I've found it best to promote ideas like this at an ''as-needed'' basis. Is this something which is an ongoing problem? If so, then I agree that we should address it. If it is only theoretical, that someone ''could'' do this, then I would hold off until we have a reason to. - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 12:38, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

:::Having right over one's creation is not by itself ownership in the concept of control, especially since the USA copyright law does not provide for moral rights over works, that is as to prevent the use of a work withing its license for purposes that the copyright holder opposes. In case of a merge if the source is destroyed on Wikibooks the authors page should also be merged, in case that a copy exists elsewhere a simple attribution to the original work suffices (in case of public domain the attribution is not obligatory but should be made). Owning rights over a work does not equate to owning control, especially using the licenses we use on Wikibooks, that are very clear in what rights/freedoms have been licensed. 
:::The issue of the alteration of these pages is common, mostly not outright malicious but by simple lack of understanding of the subject.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 13:16, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

::::I do not think there are any real copyright problems here, but I think the important thing is that Wikibooks needs more authors willing to start and ''finish'' a book. I have seen countless books on WIkibooks that have never got past the starting stages, but still exist. Wikibooks ''really'' needs writers willing to go through the whole process of writing a Wikibook, and I think a good way to try to attract these kinds of people into coming and staying here is by giving them more attribution, regardless of what copyright laws require. As I mentioned before, it would also help users identify who's point of view they are reading. A possible solution is to have a regulated, possibly protected &quot;Authors&quot; page for each book, maybe even each chapter, and to transclude these pages in some way to the top of each page in a small font.

:If we're going to do this then a fully protected author page for the book is the most sensible approach. An author namespace provides no added benefits because the issues raised (e.g., deleting a link and then adding a new author page) apply equally to the namespace. Indeed there is no functional difference between a page in a &quot;protected&quot; namespace and a protected page in another namespace. There is sufficient oversight of vandalism on this project to prevent attempts to &quot;hijack&quot; an author sub-page in the way described not least because the original author page cannot be deleted by the vandal, would still exist within the book's structure and would pre-date the &quot;new&quot; author page. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:56, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

::As far as I know there are only 3 protecting methods on Wikibooks: move, edit and upload. Which one will be sufficient to ensure that the link of the author subpage remains on the first page of the book?

:::There's no requirement for the link to the author subpage to be on the first page of the book. If you understand the structure of Wikibooks (not sure if you do as you are editing anonymously so I don't know who you are) but every page in the book sits as a subpage below the main page. That means that the author subpage is there, in the book, even if the link on the main page is removed. The only way you could &quot;remove&quot; it from the book would be to move every other page in the book to a new name leaving it behind. There is no way this kind of page move vandalism would not be spotted. In any case, the redirects left behind would make it clear what had happened. Personally I think the &quot;someone may hijack the work&quot; concerns are a distraction because they are possible but so unlikely that they aren't worth considering. The real issue appears to be is the current level of attribution to the authors discouraging people from contributing and, if it is, what methods can improve this without discouraging other new editors &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:06, 2 April 2012 (UTC)
:::: Wikibooks are not closed, in the sense of an author or group author having the right to tell everyone to &quot;back off, it's ''mine/ours!&amp;thinsp;''&quot;.  Any expression of authorship must make clear that others are welcome to contribute; so protecting an authorship page would send exactly the wrong kind of message.

:::: And &amp;mdash;I'm not sure how to make this crystal clear&amp;mdash; there is ''nothing different'' about assuring that author information isn't vandalized, than about assuring that any other information isn't vandalized.

::::: In the general terms I agree with you, but the question is if the administration or anyone that is not directly involved with the projects can easily determine and detect that type of vandalism (in this case a copyright violation). That after an author leaves a work (lets take it to the extreme and consider that the project will run for a few decades from now) that his copyright is respected (I see this as the main point of the initial proponent). 
::::: Note also that the authors page is not only about authors but serves to legally bind the creator and his work with the license and to comply with third party acknowledgments, some obligatory. I do not recognize as a valid the assumption that volunteers would actively protect the &quot;rights&quot; ownership of others (a situation very similar to how public domain or public interests are generally treated), this becomes even more evidently an issue since historically there are those that actively defend an antagonistic policy view in regards to these aspect, even before I joined the project there was an attempt to remove all authors pages as defended above by Darklama (this was related on a discussion with [[User:Robert Horning]] I don't remember if he was talking to me, Whiteknight or Darklama), as told IIRC the view was championed by someone that held a high place on the Wikimedia structure.
::::: I have myself corrected some of those types of vandalism but in cases of aggravated complexity (large works or works with a large amount of edits) I would not venture to do so and in case of altering third party acknowledgments I wouldn't be able to validate them. This also relates to solution advanced by [[user:QU]] of a full edit protection, author pages should not be so broadly protected because those editing them are not obligatory authors. For instance, one can merge works and need to do the required attribution to the source. I do not see a benefit on having the administration be the gatekeepers but would be satisfied that if restricted to auto-reviewers/reviewers that the more common type of vandalism would be addressed and anyone with auto-reviewers/reviewers would have passed at least a minimum amount of scrutiny, in fact I agree with you that a full edit protection violated common practice of assuming good faith.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:35, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

I think if you want to transclude an author page onto books you've contributed to you should just go ahead and do it - there's no need for a policy. However, doing the same for every book here is a big job, would required vetting and verification of the authors (or identification of them if they haven't created an author page alread) and is therefore unlikely to actually get done even if we all think it is a good idea. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:11, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::::I think that the only request that would be important to make is that the information is part of the print version (or any method offered to move the work) and linked directly from the cover page.

I happen to agree that there is no benefit to having administrators be gatekeepers because people in general (including administrators) can have a difficult time validating changes. I also agree that volunteers don't actively protect the &quot;rights&quot; of others. I think there is only a limited need to protect the &quot;rights&quot; of third-parties, because anyone who contributes directly has given permission to use their contributions freely by clicking save. Third-parties are likely to be unaware of Wikibooks' practices and how their work might be used, unless someone has informed them, but at the same time any third-party claim is difficult to validate. I oppose obligating anyone, including administrators, to do anything involving authors, until there is a consensus on how to address, validate, and acknowledge third-party claims. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:26, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::::::: This is something that I have attempted to explain to you many times. I will give yet again another go. The click-through is merely for the protection of the project (and only that) and is mostly an informative tool (no one after that may state that they did not have the information) but as a legal binding transaction it is very flimsy. I even dispute any worth on the last bit &quot;You agree that a hyperlink or URL is sufficient attribution under the Creative Commons license.&quot; it is simply nonsensical. Another problem is that the notification has been changed many times without any say of the community nor even a site wise notice regarding the change or its implications and that is extremely sad, even a bit disturbing because it becomes an imposition.
:::::::::: Then there is the issue that if we where to recognize any legal validity it only would bind the submitter of the content and would only be valid while part of the history edit log, but those logs are not part of the work (nor protected in any way by the licenses) beyond the copy on Wikibooks. It is expected and almost undeniable that at least some books will outlast the project and so it is clear that the notice makes no sense beyond what I said, as a protective measure and informative tool. Then there are more complex subjects, like we have also discusses about; Wikibooks being an aggregate of independent works, each work (not contribution) has its own copyright status and license (not a site wide license like the click-through implies).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:07, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

So just to &lt;s&gt;resume&lt;/s&gt; summarize and restate what we have discussed and help reformulate the proposal.&lt;br&gt;
This discussion of the proposal seems to:&lt;br&gt;
a) Not contradict or invalidate any of the views as expressed by Darklama (and in the past others), are not an opposition to the proposal but to the existence of the author pages, something that goes beyond what is being discussed, but has been objected above.&lt;br&gt;
b) Since author pages exist and do, whatever view is defended, have a legal validity and serve a function, special consideration regarding their protection may be warranted. No one objected specifically to that.&lt;br&gt;
c) It can be concluded that only those involved in the work (especially those making claims authorship/copyright ownership or using the pages to give the necessary legal or moral attributions to third parties or sources) have the capacity to fully respond or validate those edits. Putting the pages beyond the normal review process for accuracy or in works covering a large number of pages or activity a creating a great burden for anyone determining copyright ownership claims. My conclusion from the previous discussion.&lt;br&gt;
d) That any decision resulting from the alteration of common practice should not be retroactive, generalized or be imposing beyond establishing a new set of guidelines regarding the handling of the type of content under discussion and validating administrative action to protect their content. My conclusion from the previous discussion.&lt;br&gt;
e) That the commonly agreed solution, from all the proposals made on how to handle the issue, would be to protect editing of these pages upon administrative request by anyone with the reviewer flag to only Wikibookians with that same flag.&lt;br&gt;
I further add a request that [[Wikibooks:Ownership]] be updated at the end of the discussion (and its edit history be revised) as to reflect this procedure, since some subjects had and are already been discussed there and that Wikibooks:Ownership page be moved to the Help namespace (since we will not be defining a policy or a guideline) but establishing a common community understanding of the subject matter regarding the function of the these types of pages (copyright information). It should continue to maintain a well written distinction between copyright ownership and editorial/content control and a clarification of author/copyright holder versus contributor. Any objection or alteration to this request does not invalidate the proposal but I feel that it would help Wikibookians to have a clear source of understanding regarding the subject. This of course can be proposed independently if people find that it needs further discussion.&lt;br&gt;
Another request, that also does not impact the proposal if opposed is that any pages regarding copyright should in the future, and retroactively as detected, be put in a specific category, possibly a subcategory of Wikibooks copyright. I believe that there will not be any objection to the categorization but possibly to the name or location. I hope no one gets distracted on this as the label/location in not as important as the functionality to ease the identification of those type of pages.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:59, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

: Here again, I do not perceive a consensus where you appear to be claiming such exists.  This discussion has gotten way too long to read, frankly; I look at the very top, where I see &quot;There are books written mainly by 1 or several authors. These authors normally create an 'authors' page for their book and put their names there. But how can it be sure that this page is protected? In other words, how can these main authors keep their names credited?&quot;, and my basic answer is still that there is no reason to protect this page in any manner it isn't already protected by our counter-vandalism measures (specifically flaggedrevs, though there's a simultaneous proposal here that could interfere with the efficacy of flaggedrevs).  If there were a reason to give it extra protection in some cases (unlikely, but ''if''), there would be no reason to create a whole namespace for the purpose.  I do find it somewhat bizarre that there's been a great deal of discussion of copyright here, as I do not consider authors pages at all relevant to copyright.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 04:17, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

::I did not claim a consensus existed only no expressed opposition was visible (except as noted). Because as you said the discussion was lengthy I &lt;s&gt;resumed&lt;/s&gt; summarized in, what seemed to me, the points that have been addressed.
::As for the page protection requirements this has been covered above and arguments put forward demonstrate that simple counter-vandalism measures do not suffice (that is even the core of the proposal as it was initially put forward). Flaggedrevs does not protect content, it protects what is displayed (and arguably provides some quality indication). So it has no special bearing on the issue, unless you are claiming that it provides visibility, but that was also already covered above. Those pages are even harder to review that simple content changes. If you still object to that notion please see if you have read all of what has been said and state why you disagree. Note that in &lt;s&gt;my resume&lt;/s&gt; the summary, as in the previous discussion, I clearly state that the creation of the  namespace is unpractical, no one objected to that observation, just the opposite...
::Regarding the relevancy of the authors pages, they are not only legally relevant (licenses and copyright law) but to the works and contributors (again this is exposed at length above). If you disagree with any please state your objections so they can be addressed (note that what is on the table is extending the protection of these pages, their relevancy or irrelevancy in relation to the proposal is only on this matter).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:46, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

::: I agree that the core of the proposal as initially put forward was that simple counter-vandalism meausres do not suffice.  This however is false.  I see no valid arguments above that refute this.  If you believe there is a valid argument that does refute it, I invite you to ''briefly state'' that argument here.  (Your use of ''resume'', btw, is not at all common in modern English usage.  I do understand what you mean by it, but I don't think I've ever encountered that usage before; Wiktionary, I see, calls it &quot;now rare&quot;.)

::: &quot;Flaggedrevs does not protect content, it protects what is displayed&quot;.  That's backwards.  Flaggedrevs protects only content, having no direct effect at all on what is displayed (except on Wikijunior).  Its function is to facilitate content quality control, by keeping track of which revisions have and have not been checked by someone in whose ability the community has sufficient confidence.

::: Authors pages, ''of the sort described at the top of this thread'', are utterly irrelevant to copyright.  Those sorts of authors pages are simply vanity pages for the editors who have put a lot of work into the book; just because somebody put their name there doesn't mean they actually did put a lot of effort into the book, just because someone didn't put their name there doens't mean they didn't put a lot of effort into the book, and just because someone didn't do a lot on the book, ''and'' didn't put their name on the authors page, doesn't mean they aren't one of the copyright holders for the pages the did edit.  It does seem from time to time that you ''might'' be talking about some entirely different kind of page, but if so it has not been readily apparent what other kind of page you were talking about.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 06:12, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

:::: I was expecting that by now anyone of the several persons using copyright notes on their works would have stepped up to argue the points. So I'm the one defending the point of a proposal that I didn't advance but since I consider the core point valid and worth pursuing I will again restate something that I've many times spoken about (and others).
:::: I can't briefly state a complex issue, and I know I tend to be verbose so bear with me... 
:::: 1) Regarding the argument that counter-vandalism measures do not suffice. - It would be obvious by previous copyvio discussions the issues we have in defining authors and obtaining the right information most of the time. I'm here since 2004 and have probably seen more discussions than you. You can check them out easily or even look at the RfD for the C++ Programming (in regards to how the copyright issue was dealt). There are also few copyvios  lingering in the backlog of deletions that supports the issue of how hard it is to determine and verify copyright ownership.
:::: Regarding the maintenance of the Copyright notices on books it would be instructive for you to do a search on the project, and simply consider their validity, we have works that still have the GFDL as their license (not that a book's license is specific for the aggregation). One task of the administration upon the conversion to the dual licensing should have been the examination of this notices if a) no copyright owners was directly licensing the work they should be removed (with care to any acknowledgments that would be required to be maintained) b) determine the date of the GFDL use (published revision of the work) and if done before the date limit, simply update to the CCBYSA30. c) if the date is after the GFDL examination contact the copyright owners or editors and get the authorization to change to the CCBYSA30 and risk of having to delete the work if some content was imported that was licensed only under the GFDL (with limitations) since the license was not compatible. To my knowledge none of this was ever done. I mention this to demonstrate that the subject of copyright and licensing is not dealt seriously or with consistency and the required Wikimedia supervision.
:::: It is also extremely difficult if not impossible to verify copyright ownership claims, that is those that add themselves (or others) as authors, copyright owners and to lists of acknowledgments. There is not only a general lack of knowledge by Wikibookians about the requirements or distinctions but as discussed these pages are left open to even to unregistered users (I would even see a need for Autoconfirmation to be able to create and edit such legal notices), and so the information that should be more valuably protected that the edit history logs is often corrupted or misused, possibly creating problems in the long run. Having as was proposed during the thread a greater requirement on creating these pages can only be of benefit to the project.
:::: Who polices this pages/type of information I rarely see anyone really taking interest in them besides the most dedicated contributors to the project. This information is not only legally useful, but has historical interest. Authors and those that donate works or permit us to reuse should rest assured that their rights are protected. I do not see how the project can evolve if we continue on the path to indifference of this matters.
:::: As a practical example consider the issue of [[Communication Networks]] and how can you verify that the information is correct (it is possible but the amount of work required is not something that the project can or should bear). Ultimately any dispute about copyrights can have tree outcomes a legal litigation between those making the claims, or with a contributor or result in removal of the work because ultimately every contributor is anonymous to a vast degree.
:::: We have to acknowledge that this pages are indeed special, more important that the disclaimers we put in some work and more that most would like to admit that the history logs, so what is the issue in granting them better protection?
:::: 2) Regarding Authors pages, ''of the sort described at the top of this thread'', being irrelevant to copyright. - By making that remark you show that you have little to no knowledge on the issue. Any phrasing that invokes rights, establish procedures or rules and invokes the law in writing constitutes a legal document. A legal instrument is simply a legal document that is unequivocally attributed to its author(s). Both our licensees require a written statement agreeing to them as to become a legal instrument. Without entering the discussion of the click-through, the use of the direct subscription of the license(s) is important to protect the work, making it clear that the work is subject to copyright, and deter infringement or plagiarism. Also to provide a means of identifying the copyright owner(s); for instance for relicensing purposes and validation of the content.
:::: These statements are not only useful (to the project, to the work and to those that claim it) but a right of those that contribute copyrightable content. If you have done the search I indicated you will have noticed a large variety of examples of people that have used this right. Ultimately having them make the statement does not infringe on anyone else's rights unless they are in violation of copyright and then a problem that we have to handle. 
:::: These legal document are not required to be in a specific page or section (like the disclaimers we normally use) but only for convenience they should be listed together.
:::: As your view that it is a matter of vanity pages, this is false by the reasons above but because people should be proud and take responsibility for their actions. The claim of ownership makes the content safer, to be valid and not a copyvio (since those making false claims could indeed get into legal trouble). In fact not defining copyright ownership is the shameful option as you are abdicating to give protection to it, in that case it would be better to give your copyrights to Wikimedia so they can in the future defend the work or relicense it. (Similar to how some people give their rights to the FSF when releasing Open Source software).
:::: Some interesting examples [[Scouting/BSA/First Aid Merit Badge]], [[Marijuana Cultivation/Introduction]], [[Linter SQL RDBMS]] (this one is extremely confusing since it is unclear if it is a replication of the software license or if it covers the work), [[Engineering Acoustics]] (redundant but not wrong), [[Strengths-Based Social Work Practice/Copyleft]] (confusing Copyleft in the name of the page, then he is both copyright owner and contributor) and [[General Engineering Introduction/Communication/Ground rules]] (I leave this one as an exercise to you...)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:52, 20 April 2012 (UTC)

I have no doubts that copyright and licenses are taken seriously by Administrators. Fortunately Wikibooks has pages that address most copyright and license concerns. Unfortunately Wikibooks does not for Authorship. Compared with copyright lawyers, Wikibooks Administrators are amateurs on the subject of copyright, licenses, and authorship. Even when people think they know whats what, things can go wrong. [http://www.informationweek.com/news/development/java/232900594 Oracle vs Google over whether programming languages and APIs can be copyrighted] or [http://tap.usf.edu/news/major-textbook-publishers-file-copyright-lawsuit-against-open-education-resource-provider/ Major Textbook Publishers vs Open Education Startup claiming copyright violations over similarities], for example.

I agree that a formal position by the community about Authorship would be very useful and helpful at encouraging people to contribute. I doubt whether Author pages in any location makes sense when neither a policy or guideline exists for people to follow or be guided by, and no community decision exists that mandates their use, how and when they are to be used, when and if its appropriate or inappropriate for anyone who contributes to Wikibooks to claim Authorship for a book, when and if its appropriate or inappropriate to add Acknowledgments for Authors who contribute directly to Wikibooks, what forms of acknowledgments/attribution for third-party works are acceptable and unacceptable, when a third-party work is used who must prove or verify permission or lack of permission and what are acceptable and unacceptable ways to do so, whether all Contributors are Authors, and where acknowledgments/attributions should be placed. I think Author pages effectively discourage people from contributing because there is no policy or guideline that describe what it means to Author a book at Wikibooks, so some people assume the ramifications are that Authors have total and complete control over the development of books. I think Wikibooks will continue to see decreased activity if an Author namespace is created without addressing the core issues first. I agree that Author pages are vanity pages because anyone may use them for any purpose since the core issues haven't been addressed yet. I think by addressing the core issues, whether to move forward with an Authors namespace will become clear. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:39, 20 April 2012 (UTC)

:Don't get it. I do not see this as an administration only issue, it is not expected that administrators know more about what is what in legal matters than any other Wikibookian. Then you classify admins as amateurs on the subject of copyright, note that these amateurs are required to, in isolation and without logs delete works they judge as violating copyright law (something that I've been extremely vocal against in the past, requesting a log keeping, but that is another discussion). This is just to point out that Wikibookians are expected to exert and interpret the law (even as to be able to contribute) and it is a special requirement for adminship to be able to enforce legal dictates.
:Then you propose that the community, that is, the active community (mostly constituted by the above mentioned amateurs) establish a position. This clearly is not possible, especially as an enforcible policy, in not wanted (by your own recognition of lack of full understanding of the subject or even an ability to consensually decide on it) not or even legal (we can't locally, rewrite the law or go against it). Legal matters should be decided by Wikimedia's legal department, the community has no power to rewrite the law and should be extremely carefully when providing their own interpretations of the law. Note that those that do not understand the legal matters should restrain themselves to act on this subjects (like in any aspect that one find oneself out-of-depth, in particular you proposal that the copyright statements should just be deleted put you on that boat).
:The claim of ownership of copyrights (not particularly authorship) is a legal right, the notice is itself not a legal required (debatable, due to the wording of the licenses, particularly the GFDL, but I tend to agree). Even if copyright law as abolished the use of the copyright statement, in this case it is useful for users, contributors (in particular required for attribution purposes) and ultimately Wikimedia. The only possible way to resolve the issue would be to force granting all the rights to Wikimedia, and this would be damaging to the project or move all works into the public domain, but by the decision of Wikimedia to use specific licensing, the copyright issues has to some point been considered, and the licenses establishes some guidelines (even if not completely clear and in view of our format).
:This of course does not invalidate that the community provides some clarifications, like you propose, we can however inform of best procedures and on disparate views, without establishing a legal interpretation. This has been attempted in the past.
:As for your statement that Author pages effectively discourage people from contributing, I accept it as your personal view, not as a fact, personally I do not know but I note that most books that have a copyright statement tend to be more complete and mature that others that people contributing have not taken responsibility over. 
:I oppose the idea of an Author namespace, the possibility to grant copyright and other legal statements and disclaimers statements a specific location and protection (page protection) seem however a simple, rational and non intrusive thing to do. With no negative implications and solving some problems and eases maintenance work. I also do not see as positive an out of proportion treatment to this issue, because most less knowledgeable Wikibookians would indeed see it as a sort of special recognition of their pears, like adminiship was seen in the past. This is not what we should aim for nor for an increase on claims of copyright ownership by those that do not fully understand the implications. Just an extra proper protection and a consistency in dealing with them is what the proponent seems to be aiming, and that I support.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 13:04, 22 April 2012 (UTC)
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

As to resume and conclude the discussion, now extremely long of the primary proposal regarding the creation of an Author namespace to protect copyright claims and attributions made by an unsigned or unregistered user and taking in consideration the opinions expressed on the subject. I move that the proposal as initially state should be negated as not gathering the consensus.&lt;br&gt;
A subsequent alternative proposal, taking in consideration what has been said, will occur afterwards as to provide communal validation for requests of page protection regarding copyright and legal sensitive notices, that will address partially the concerns of the initial proponent.&lt;br&gt;
This request will be open for participation until &lt;u&gt;7 days after the last post on this thread&lt;/u&gt;. '''No opposition (or their restatement) will mean that the community does not support the creation of a new Author namespace''' (as initial proposed).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:50, 30 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Kexi database can hold 5 types of objects: tables, queries, forms, reports, and scripts.

A table is a grid that holds data (for instance, the patrons of a library.) The horizontal rows of the grid are called &quot;records&quot;, and contain information on a single entity (e.g. one patron). The vertical columns hold a piece data of a certain ''type'' (e.g. a patron's phone number), and are called &quot;fields&quot;.

A query creates sets of data pulled from one or more tables. Various operators and functions may be used to manipulate the data. For instance, in a library database, you could take the &quot;patrons&quot; table (which also has data on which books are checked out), and correlate it with the &quot;books&quot; table (which has book titles and due dates), to form a new table that holds information on all patrons that still have overdue books.

Forms provide a simple, familiar interface for editing and viewing the database.

Kexi scripts can be written in JavaScript, Python, or any other scripting language supported by Kross (the KDE scripting framework).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Casual gaming==
The rise of casual gaming, or relatively cheaper pc games has grown quickly with casual games representing 2.25 billion dollars in revenue in 2008. Casual games include hits such as [[w:Diner Dash|Diner Dash]] , [[w:Feeding Frenzy (video game)|Feeding Frenzy]] , and
[[w:Bejeweled|Bejeweled]] and have a demographic which is 74% female. Social and casual gaming is expanding rapidly. In 2011 Social and casual gaming received about half of all game related investments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/162929/Social_casual_market_dominated_game_investments_in_2011_report_says.php&lt;/ref&gt; casual games however oftern operate under the try before you buy business model. Users download a game then purchase a code to unlock the entirety of it's features. There is however especially in the PC arena, the problem of online piracy eroding profits. The game Ricochet:Infinity, had a player base in which 92% of users pirated the game. The piracy problem has lead to a revenue model which derives much of it's revenue from in-game ads and microtransactions in freemium games rather than from initial purchase price.

== FarmVille ==
Farmville, is a farming simulations social network game released in 2009 by Zynga. It surpassed 80 million monthly active users making it the most actively played game in world wide, until it was later surpassed by similar Zynga game CityVille. The farmville user base has since deflated, in large part due to spam curbing efforts by Facebook reducing notifications to invite friends to participate. The revenue model for farmville comes from the purchasing of ingame items for Farmville cash, which can be bought using currency which can either be attained in game or instantaneously for cash. The strong network externalities, free entry and ease of access and automatic advertising brought about its rapid success. By integrating with facebook, it became much easier to establish a social relations in farmville. It also exhibits several psychological hooks which help engage the user base to the level where people start paying for in-game assets. For one many of the ways in which items are required are random and require a very intensive use of farm cash. You get between 5-6 farmville dollars for a U.S. dollar depending on the number purchased. They are used to buy decorative items for a farm. There is a slot machine as well as several other methods which give random rewards. They can also be used to purchase in came coins in order to speed progress through the game and customization. Farmville requires that you add a certain number of neighbors in order to expand, this provides strong network externalities making the desire to expand great. Neighbors can tend each others crops and send gifts to one another. The player base of Farmville is largely nonpaying however, and a small fraction generate most of the revenue from Farmville.

==ZT online==
The advantage of freemium model is that it enables free entry, but the micro-transaction model
can allow users to spend extreme amounts in order to maintain their standing in a game. One notorious
instance of this is in the Chinese MMORPG ZT(ZhengThu) online. ZT Online was the most popular
Chinese online game in 2007-2008{{cn}}&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZT_Online&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;. While there is not fee ofr entry, all items are gained by opening chests
with keys that cost money real world money. Once chests are opened a roulette style 
indicator randomly selects the items from a an alluring list containing items of varying degrees.
The rarest items having a very low probabilities of selection. This creates gambling mechanic for 
virtual goods, and an addicting and stratified power structure. Rewards for opening the most chests in a day further spur on
users to spend large amounts on the game.

In the third quarter of 2007 ZT online had an average revenue per user of an impressive RMB 305.2 48.41 dollars&lt;ref&gt;http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/board.aspx?board_id=11228#&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly high for a freemium game and represents the fact that micro-transactions are an integral  part of playing the game, woven in with the addicting psychology of gambling.

==League of Legends==
League of legends is an action strategy game released by Riot games in 2009. While matches take place between teams of 5(sometimes 3) in independent instances, there are several persistent elements to the game, such as summoner level runes and accumulated champions. Customizable character skins which can only be bought for the games virtual currency. AS with many virtual currencies, the appeal is twofold, not only does it add a small degree of separation from real world money, but virtual currency is generally purchased in denominations that differ from the prices of in-game assets. This results in an increased desire to spend with the sometimes perpetually left over money. The System is setup so runes, which raise the statistics of in-game characters, are purchased via influence points, a currency gained solely through in game play(Although boosts which multiply the amount gained from play can be purchased for riot points). There is also a second in game currency, riot  points which can be only be purchased using real money. For each match the player selects a champion with which to play, they can either select from one of 10 free champions, rotated randomly on a weekly basis, or from a champion they have purchased. Champions can be purchased either through riot points or influence points. Purchasing them through influence points however is extremely time consuming and detracts from one's ability to purchase stat raising runes. This inspires players to spend money to permanently unlock champions they desire to play, as well as skins to customize the champions their favorites. Since skins can only be bought using riot points, players are paying to express their identity, sometimes $10 or more per skin. This along with a constant stream of new champions allows for some players to pay large amounts of money while others can buy few or no champions.
==Zynga==
The company behind farmville, CityVille is one of the largest social gaming companies. In Feb 2012 they reported a revenue of $311 million with an average of $2 per user. With only about 3% of the users paying,&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2012/03/23/zynga-economics/&lt;/ref&gt; Zynga relies on a small segment of large spenders to generate the it's revenue while the rest of the users provide the competitive environment will take place.
==Riot games==
In order to foster a more competitive atmosphere as well as increase the overall play base, Riot games has invested heavily in the competitive scene. With a $5million dollar prize pool announced for the second season of League of legends, including a $2 million dollar finals. This move is designed to grow the userbase for league of legends as well as increase the number of hardcore users as they contribute largely per user in order to remain competitive. In February of 2011 Riot games was purchased by Tencent, a Chinese internet holdings company for $400 million dollars.

==The stigma of paying for success==
The important aspect of League of Legends is that while many trappings of success can be bought it has avoided the stigma associated with too much influence from money in the game. Stat changes from runes are only influenced marginally by the spending of money, and champions in the free rotation come from the list of buyable one's so there's no inherent disadvantage in paying for progress. This has prevented a mass disuasion of free users as one would see in games such as Zt online. The important part is to balance the act of encouraging payment while still providing incentives for free users to say on board, since a large player base is necessary to sustain itself in the tippy online market.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Zombie threads ===

Any thread that has terminated but has not been joined or detached will leak OS resources until the process terminates. Unfortunately, neither &lt;tt&gt;/proc&lt;/tt&gt; nor &lt;tt&gt;gdb&lt;/tt&gt; will show you these zombie threads, at least not on some kernels. 

One way to get them is with a gdb canned command:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#
#
#
define trace_call
    b $arg0
    commands
    bt full
    continue
    end
end
document trace_call
Trace specified call with call stack to screen. Example:
    set breakpoint pending on
    set pagination off
    set logging on
    trace_call __pthread_create_2_1
end

Another way is to use (again) an interposition library:

The output is a bit rough but it can be refined down to file and line by replacing &lt;tt&gt;backtrace_symbols_fd()&lt;/tt&gt; with appropriate code:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
*** pthread_create:
./libhook.so(pthread_create+0x8c)[0x400215d3]
./plock[0x8048a7f]
/lib/i686/cmov/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xe0)[0x4006f450]
./plock[0x8048791]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== File descriptors ===

As just about anything is a file (folders, sockets, pipes, etc, etc...), just about anything can result in a file descriptor that needs to be closed. &lt;tt&gt;/proc&lt;/tt&gt; can help:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# tree /proc/26041
/proc/26041
...
|-- fd                  # Open files descriptors
|   |-- 0 -&gt; /dev/pts/21
|   |-- 1 -&gt; /dev/pts/21
|   |-- 2 -&gt; /dev/pts/21
|   `-- 3 -&gt; socket:[113497835]
|-- fdinfo
|   |-- 0
|   |-- 1
|   |-- 2
|   `-- 3
...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;trace_call&lt;/tt&gt; command for &lt;tt&gt;gdb&lt;/tt&gt; can help with the call stack.

If gdb is not available on the machine, an interposition library hooking &lt;tt&gt;open()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;pipe()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;socket()&lt;/tt&gt;, etc. can be built.

Other tools that can be used:
* &lt;tt&gt;lsof&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;fuser&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Ports ===

Which process is using a port? As root:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# netstat -tlnp
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address               Foreign Address             State       PID/Program name

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;

python  3438 root    4u  IPv4  11416       TCP localhost.localdomain:2207 (LISTEN)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Other tools:
* &lt;tt&gt;fuser&lt;/tt&gt;

=== IPC ===

For semaphores, shared memory and message queues.

* &lt;tt&gt;ipcs&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;ipcrm&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# ipcs -spt

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== DYI: an interposition resource counter ===

[[Linux_Applications_Debugging_Techniques/Leaks#DIY:libmemleak|libmemleak]] can be easily modified to keep track of whatever resources are leaking. Hook the right API (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;open()/close()&lt;/tt&gt;).

      <comment>/* Building and installing megafont */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page provides advice on how to install the MediaWiki-to-LaTeX converter wb2pdf in Fedora. It is wholly based in [[en:User:Duplode|my]] own experience with F16, so take it with a grain of salt and adapt the details to your system if need be. You will likely want to check [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf|the main wb2pdf page]], with download links and usage instructions, and in particular [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf/ubuntu|the installation guide for Ubuntu]], from which this page was originally derived.

== The TeXLive 2011 repository ==

The default Fedora 16 repositories carry an outdated set of TeXLive packages which lacks many things we will need for wb2pdf. Before installing the packages, it is necessary to install the test repository for TeXLive 2011 (see this [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/TeXLive Fedora Project page] for details and instructions for Fedora versions other than 16). In Fedora 16, run:

 su -c 'rpm -i http://jnovy.fedorapeople.org/texlive/2011/packages.fc16/texlive-release.noarch.rpm'
 su -c 'yum clean all'

If you already have the older TeXLive installed, you will also need to

 su -c 'yum update'

== Installing packages ==

Next, we will install all packages needed for building and running wb2pdf, including the TexLive ones. Here is the yum command, in one shot:

 su -c 'yum install subversion python3 python3-tkinter ImageMagick librsvg2 fontforge-devel ghc ghc-regex-compat-devel ghc-HTTP-devel ghc-split-devel ghc-MissingH-devel cabal-install texlive-scheme-basic texlive-collection-latexrecommended texlive-collection-latexextra texlive-collection-fontsrecommended texlive-collection-fontsextra texlive-collection-games texlive-collection-humanities texlive-collection-science texlive-arabtex texlive-cjk texlive-collection-langcjk texlive-collection-langcyrillic texlive-collection-langgreek texlive-collection-langvietnamese texlive-cm-super texlive-gnu-freefont wqy-zenhei-fonts'

The same packages, in a more readable presentation: 

 su -c 'yum install subversion python3 python3-tkinter ImageMagick librsvg2 fontforge-devel'
 su -c 'yum install ghc ghc-regex-compat-devel ghc-HTTP-devel ghc-split-devel ghc-MissingH-devel cabal-install'
 su -c 'yum install texlive-scheme-basic texlive-collection-latexrecommended texlive-collection-latexextra'
 su -c 'yum install texlive-collection-fontsrecommended texlive-collection-fontsextra texlive-collection-games'
 su -c 'yum install texlive-collection-humanities texlive-collection-science texlive-arabtex texlive-cjk'
 su -c 'yum install texlive-collection-langcjk texlive-collection-langcyrillic texlive-collection-langgreek'
 su -c 'yum install texlive-collection-langvietnamese texlive-cm-super texlive-gnu-freefont wqy-zenhei-fonts'

(This list was inferred from the [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf/ubuntu|Ubuntu instructions]]; compare with that one if you find some package is missing - and if so I kindly ask you to correct the commands here.)

There are two packages which are not in the Fedora repositories. ghc-hxt will be automatically installed by Cabal (the Haskell package system) when you build wb2pdf; there is also unifont, which will be dealt with in a later step.

== Building wb2pdf ==

Next, we will get the sources and build wb2pdf:

 svn co https://wb2pdf.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wb2pdf wb2pdf
 cd wb2pdf/trunk
 cabal update
 cabal install
 cd src
 python3 makelinuxbins.py

Note that I am assuming a per-user (as opposed to global) installation of wb2pdf by cabal.

== Building and installing megafont ==

wb2pdf requires a set of fonts, called megafont, which is a combination of the unifont, FreeSerif ans wqy-zenhei fonts. We need to build and install megafont to the LaTeX tree. wb2pdf comes with a python script which help building megafont. First, however, you will need to download unifont, which is not in the Fedora repositories. You can get it from [http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html this page] (the first link to a ttf.gz file). Extract it to the &lt;tt&gt;font&lt;/tt&gt; sudirectory of the svn trunk and rename the ttf file to unifont.ttf .

The script for installing megafont is in the same &lt;tt&gt;font&lt;/tt&gt; subdirectory. To run it, then, do: 

 cd ../font
 su -c 'python3 installunifont_fedora.py'

The script will install the fonts to the LaTeX tree for local additions, as set in your system by the file /usr/share/texlive/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf . You can find it with:

 kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL

== Updating the TeX tree ==

(This section is based in information from [http://www.tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html this page from the TeX Users Group].)

Finally, we need to register the megafont fonts in the TeX tree. To do that, run the following commands:

 su -c 'texhash'
 updmap --enable Map=megafont.map
 su -c 'texhash'

Again, note that the updmap step is being performed locally, and not globally.

wb2pdf is now ready to run:

 cd ../src/
 python3 gui.py

And that's it - for further instructions, see the [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk Huenniger/wb2pdf/manual|wb2pdf manual]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Wikibookians,&lt;br /&gt;

No doubt some of you are familiar with the free college courses available on [http://Saylor.org Saylor.org]. Much like the Wikimedia community, we are committed to providing free and accessible education for everyone with internet access. At Saylor, we combine some of our custom-created educational materials with materials that are already available throughout the internet. However, because we sometimes use links to third party materials, those sections of our courses are not entirely sustainable. The Saylor Wikibooks Project is a way for you to help minimize that threat. We’ve uploaded a number of our course outlines to Wikibooks in the hope that you all will contribute to our effort. Our course outlines have been developed by our consultant professors by studying a collection of syllabi of relevant courses from various traditional brick and mortar institutions. This guarantees that our students will be provided the same learning opportunity as a student enrolled in a traditional institution. We believe that we have created the best structure for our courses, which optimizes the information that students would be expected to know. By creating openly licensed content that fits in with Saylor’s established course outlines, (in the form of Wikibooks’ textbooks), you can add to the ever-expanding body of wiki material, while simultaneously improving the sustainability of our courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for your help, &lt;br /&gt;

The Saylor Team

'''&lt;big&gt;Summary&lt;/big&gt;'''

[[File:Onion Cells.jpg|thumb|right]]
The cell is the fundamental unit of life; in fact, the smallest living organisms are composed of a single cell.  Despite their small size, cells are far from simple, and we have only recently begun to understand just how complex they are.  This text will present you with a detailed overview of a cell’s main components and functions.  The text is roughly organized into four major areas: the cell membrane, cell nucleus, cell cycle, and cell interior.  We will approach most of these topics straightforwardly, from a molecular and structural point of view.


'''&lt;big&gt;Global Learning Outcomes&lt;/big&gt;'''
* Explain what a eukaryotic cell is, identify the components of the cell, and describe how a cell functions. 
* Explain how cell membranes are formed.
* Identify the general mechanisms of transport across cell membranes.
* List the different ways in which cells communicate with one another—specifically, via signaling pathways. 
* Define what the extracellular matrix is composed of in different cells and how the extracellular matrix is involved in forming structures in specific tissues.
* List the components of the cell’s cytoskeleton and explain how the cytoskeleton is formed and how it directs cell movements.
* Explain the fundamentals of gene expression and describe how gene expression is regulated at the protein level.
* Define and explain the major cellular events involved in mitosis and cytokinesis.
* Identify the major cellular events that occur during meiosis.
* Describe the eukaryotic cell cycle and identify the events that need to occur during each phase of the cell cycle.
* Identify all of the major organelles in eukaryotic cells and their respective major functions.


__TOC__

==[[/Review of Basic Concepts/]]==

Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
* Identify the functions of major organic molecules.
* Understand hydrophilic and hydrophobic bonds and their respective roles in cells (particularly in terms of cell-membrane structure).
* Understand the four levels of protein structures and be able to identify which structure is referred to in a given example.
* Understand the relationship between free energy and the direction of a reaction.
&lt;br /&gt;

::1.1.1 [[/Amino Acids/]]
::1.1.2 [[/Four Levels of Protein Structures/]]
::1.1.3 [[/Carbohydrates/]]
::1.1.4 [[/ATP/]]
::1.1.5 [[/DNA and RNA/]]
::1.1.6 [[/Free Energy and ATP/]]

==[[/The Cell Membrane/]]==

Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a collection of HTML tables that you want to convert to PDF.

== Method ==
We will use an XQuery typeswitch transformation that will convert the key table elements (table,thead,tr,th,db,tbody) to the corresponding XSL-FO elements.

== Sample Main Dispatcher ==
We will create an XQuery module with the following functions:

* a main dispater function for starting the transform
* a single function for each table element
* a function to process the class attributes for each element

To transform the table the following will be used:

   let $fo-table := html-2-fo:main($html-table);

:There shouldn't be any difference, the practice of psychiatric rehabilitation should be an activity performed by a psychiatrist. If used in another context it will be a good indicator that the one calling himself a practitioner has no (or incomplete) formation as a psychiatrist.

== Welcome message ==
Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose of this book==

Is this book going to be any more than a copy of the book [http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio301/ BIO301:Cell Biology] published by Saylor.org? A simple copy wouldn't really be in line with our policies (please see [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]]). [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 22:47, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

BIO301 is a course that is hosted on Saylor.org, not a book.  Much of the content in that course is not openly licensed so right now Saylor just links to that material, rather than hosting it themselves.  The purpose of putting the course outline (which doubles as the potential outline for text), on wikibooks, was to allow the wiki community to help write entries for the units.  These entries, (and eventually, hopefully this book) will give Saylor the opportunity to host more of their resources, and provide students with a more sustainable experience.  So in that way, it is much more than a simple copy.

[[User:Scphillips|Scphillips]] ([[User talk:Scphillips|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scphillips|contribs]]) 21:46, 3 May 2012 (UTC)

:I think that could be OK then, but you need to provide attributions to Saylor.org for the material you have adapted from their course. As they say in their FAQ &quot;...you are free to download, modify, and reproduce our course outlines for any purpose, as long as you provide credit (attribution) to the Saylor Foundation for the source material.&quot;. This can be done by inserting references to the source material in your text.

== What to do next ==

I've worked on a wikijunior book [[Wikijunior:The Little Gardener|The Little Gardener]], and I am pretty much done with it for now, although there is certainly room to expand. My question is, what can I do next with it? Is there a place to ask for the community to review, copyedit or give suggestions? I would love to get feedback and help to &quot;finish&quot; it.

I tried to keep the directions simple, so it is lacking more specifics simply because it acts to help grow the ''seed''. Also, where can I add it to have more visibility? I don't think the title is very searchable, and if that is a problem I will gladly move it. - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 02:15, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

: If you haven't encountered our book [[Using Wikibooks]] (which was recently promoted to Featured Book status), you may find it has some quite useful information in it; several chapters in the part &quot;The Wikibooks Writer&quot; pertain to creating a book.  Also, I notice there's some relevant stuff in [[Using Wikibooks/Cleanup and Maintenance#New Books and Organizing]].

: You'll want to add, to your book's landing page, templates {{tl|Subjects}}, {{tl|Alphabetical}}, and {{tl|Status}}.  Take a look at the landing pages of some other Wikijunior books for comparison (say, [[Wikijunior:Big Cats]]).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 02:48, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

:Doesn't it miss the best time for planting information (I understand this changes from location, but since you cover outdoors planting...).
:You could probably also link it to other Wikibooks (see [[Gardening]]) for more detailed information. It would also be interesting to kids to understand seeds and soil a little better, even how to make compost as a recycling activity.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:50, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

:: This is a Wikijunior book we're talking about, though.  We generally don't link the books for kids (which have extra protection against vandalism, via flaggedrevs configuration) to the books for adults (where transitory vandalism is instantly visible).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 14:25, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

::: I do not see that as a problem (like linking to Wikipedia), I have done so in the past. If I was a vandal attempting to get minors to view objectionable content that way I would think very about start betting the lottery. Wikibooks vandalism is not that bad, the added content that would be problematic to minors is as very small part of it, mostly done by kids themselves, and I never had to correct anything in the books related to this sort of topic (exception to the Cannabis book that I don't see Theornamentalist using). The idea is for the adult content to provide further explanations or be used as source to extend the subjects at Wikijunior...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 15:53, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

:::: Fwiw, as I recall there'd been an incident in the months leading up to our big push to vandalism-proof the whole of Wikijunior, in which a graphic image of... I think it was some variety of aroused human sexual organ... was put up in a bunch of places.  I no longer remember for sure whether some of them were on Wikijunior, but the point of proofing Wikijunior was that while adults may (as I think I put it at the time) shake their heads at the folly of vandals, clean up the mess, and move on &amp;mdash; kids, or their guardians, should expect they won't be randomly subjected to such things on Wikijunior.  We had a very off-putting warning notice at the top of the Wikijunior main page for a while, to the effect that we can't guarantee your kid won't be subjected to something really perverted, until we'd finished proofing the whole subproject.

:::: I didn't mean to suggest vandals would deliberately plan to catch kids coming from Wikijunior, but rather than kids and their guardians ought to be given a browsing experience on Wikijunior that remains within the protected zone of Wikijunior.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 17:55, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

::::: I understand the preoccupation and intention but it seems that you are attempting to establish a best practice guideline for Wikijunior (I have been a merely sporadic contributor, some spellings or formatting and I think I have linked to wikipedia one time or another. I don't have kids and personally I do not believe in walled gardens of any kind, and I especially dislike self-censuring toward undefined dangers.
::::: Since I'm not a persistent contributor to that project (nor have plans to do any major work there) it is beyond me to attempt to say what people should do or not do. I would not let my kids if below 10 to use the Internet without active guidance by a trusted adult, and I'm extremely open minded and not at all pudic.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:30, 2 April 2012 (UTC)         
:::::: Afaik, I'm describing existing best-practice.  Not so much censorship as reasonable precaution; not a walled garden, but a playground with a chain link fence around it, which is pretty unremarkable.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 20:31, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

Thank you for taking the time to respond, I will work on it this week. Regarding linking to wikipedia on each page, I could link it to simple.wp instead, though I initially had reservations in doing so. - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 16:05, 2 April 2012 (UTC)
:Thank you all again for the feedback; there is still work I plan on doing this week, but I wanted to know if the main Wikijunior page is reserved for books which are featured or are of a certain assumed level of completeness. As far as the book scope I intended (which was to assist with growing the seeds, I feel it is somewhat complete. However, with there literally being millions of plants to be grown, I don't feel comfortable marking it as complete with the {{tl|status}} template nor even somewhat complete. I think that the tools and engine for this book are mostly complete, but not the breadth of it. 
:I am going to expand a bit on each seed directions, and also the glossary, as well as give some general sources or &quot;see also&quot; links, but for the most part, I am satisfied with it.
:I would love to work with some other users on a new wikijunior book; is anyone interested or have any ideas? - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 12:50, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

:: Regardless of whether or not it's complete enough for the Wikijunior main page, your book should be listed at [[WJ:All Books]].  When we get a chance I expect we'll automate [[WJ:All Books]], but for now it's still manual.  Note that where your book goes on that page depends on its status, which it looks like you haven't defined yet.

:: Though we generally wait until a book is useful (ideally, complete) before putting it on the WJ main page, how that translates into &quot;status&quot; may vary.  For example, there's no reasonable doubt (imho) that [[WJ:The Elements]] belongs there, despite the number of elements not covered.

:: I'd say your book should be brushed up just a bit, and then go up on the WJ main page.  Looking at it, there are just one or two purely technical things I'd say really need to be cleaned up (hope I can get to that tonight or tomorrow); and I've got one suggestion for improvement I hope to discuss with you on the book's main talk page (and then if you've no objection we can act on that).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 18:52, 5 April 2012 (UTC)
== Silly question about book subdivisions ==

Hello everybody! It's great to be back here after so long :)

I return with a lingering doubt about what is the better way to name book subdivisions. The ultimate source of my worries is that I would like to make such &quot;meta&quot; terminology uniform within the [[Haskell]] Wikibook, but it has a deeper structure than usual is making things trickier. If you go to its main page, you will see first there are three big coloured blocks in the table of contents. These, in turn, are divided in a few slices; and these slices contain the pages proper. Now, &quot;module&quot;, which is the default Wikibooks term for the individual pages, is objected by contributors because there are things called modules in Haskell, and so it would sound strange to use the same word for the pages. Lately I have used &quot;chapters&quot; to talk about to the pages, so that &quot;sections&quot; can be used to refer to level 2 headers within them. Problem is, there are two other levels in the hierarchy... one of them might be spoken of as &quot;units&quot;, but I'm not sure about what to do with other one. So, what options do I have?

Cheers, --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 06:45, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

: In the [[Conlang]] book, units at all levels are called &quot;sections&quot;, as I recall.

: Commonly, if a book has a small number of major units, they're called &quot;Parts&quot; (e.g. Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), units below that level are Chapters, which are divided into Sections, which are divided into Subsections, Subsubsections, etc.  I'm actually studying a purchased textbook atm in which the major units, that I'd have called Parts, are called Chapters.  So there's a lot of flexibility in usage.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 11:03, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

:: I had forgotten about two facts about the book. Firstly, two of the three larger divisions are already referred to as &quot;Tracks&quot; (as in &quot;Beginner's Track&quot;), so we could simply extend the nomenclature to the third one. That would leave &quot;Units&quot; for the intermediate divisions and &quot;Chapters&quot; for the pages. However, and secondly, there are several templates (navigation, etc.) which refer to the intermediate divisions as Chapters (just like your textbook). And there seem to be no regular contributors around with which I could discuss any possible changes... :( --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 00:45, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

::: It's not uncommon for a given book to have only one person actively working on it at a given time.  This was so for much of the time I was working most actively on [[Conlang]].  I always announced what I was doing on the talk pages, and if it was something especially significant I generally announced my intention and waited a while before acting on it (sometimes as much as a week, if I had the patience&amp;nbsp;:-).  If someone did come back later, they could read on the talk pages all about what I'd done (and that did, in fact, happen after I'd been working on it for a few months).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:02, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

== Two questions about history merges ==

Assuming no objections are raised I will perform a merge of [[Haskell/Class declarations]] into [[Haskell/Classes and types]] in a few days. In order to avoid link rot, &quot;Class declarations&quot; (which currently has the bulk of the content) will be retained as a redirect. My questions, then, are:

1. Is it necessary/recommended to ask for a history merge in such a situation, or is it simpler to just cross-reference the involved pages in the edit summaries of the merge?

2. Does the history merge procedure imply the deletion of the source page of the merge? (That would mean I would have to recreate &quot;Class declarations&quot; as a redirect afterwards.)

--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 00:32, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

:It is recommended to ask for history merges if indeed source material is to be deleted. Cross-reference is always welcomed just to make clear that the content that is being moved in bulk is from a merge.
:History merges imply the deletion of the source page(s) unless a request is made not to delete (in this case it is not categorized as a merge but a derivation). This cases are rare and should be carefully considered, since there is no point in Wikibooks hosting duplicated material (see the [[Wikibooks:Forking|fork policy draft]] and discussion for the arguments).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:51, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

: I would disagree in this particular case, where you goal is to leave a redirect.  By leaving a link to which ever page your merging from in the edit summary (or perhaps the talk page) your satisfying any copyright requirements that exist.  Then changing &quot;Class declarations&quot; to a redirect requires no special tools and makes life simpler all around. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 03:14, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

::That would imply that the administration would be perfect in checking history logs when deleting redirect page. That a redirect outside of the root namespace has any long lasting usefulness (unless it is included in the navigational structure of the work) and that the one doing the copying would also not make mistakes in referencing in the destination the source page and on the redirect that the content was moved. Overall doable, but highly risky and so the alternatives should be pursued, even if the redirect is what is intended. Easier on the one using the content and on the administration doing the deletions (and any future admin that has to handle the redirect).
::In this cases it is not even specifically about copyright issues but just to maintaining a consistent edit history log. There are many other benefits one is attempting to contact the ones responsible for some action, even helping detection and correction of malfeasance...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:21, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

::: Well I think we will have to agree to disagree.  From an administrative point of view I find redirects fairly easy to deal with.  I find history merges often rather difficult.  When done in error (which would not be the case here) they are very difficult to undo.  Links are also more appropriate in many cases, such as one page merged into multiple places,  etc.  As I understand this was a major reason for changing the license so to alleviate the requirement of keeping a complete author list on every page.  But I digress.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:42, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

:::: I have no problem with that. But since we are discussing methodologies I must confess that I do not know how many merges you performed but as an editor I have done plenty. Never done history merges because I'm not an admin, but think you are over selling the complexity. When done in error merges are not difficult to undo, unless they are done in some sort of convoluted way, like the one you are proposing.
:::: In case you use content, from a single source page, into multiple target pages, you should select the one that closely matches the previous content/function and that, at the time of the merge, has the best chance for stability in the resulting merged project. That would be the best repository for the merged edit history.
:::: As the one performing the merge moves content from the source location he should add on the resulting edits' comment that the content is the result that merge (time of edits will suffice for later correlations).
:::: To undo a merge you must only determine what page was deleted and restore it. Look at it's history, see the time and read the merge comment/edit for the target of the merge. Go into the target look at edits near that time frame revert the content to the nearest possible and check edits from that user on that timeframe on all pages on that namespace (you can probably get a easy match in the user's contribution page). Note also that there are very few cases of complex merges and due to their complexity they are mostly performed by competent editors with some experience, they will often be available to help undo any action.
:::: I've been here since 2004 and never have observed reversing a merge.
:::: If one takes only the requirements of copyright attributions, reversing a merge is simply the splitting up of a work, in that case one should need only to mention that and give any required attributions to the copyright owners if listed, it will constitute a derived work, if both works will rest on the project the source (the merged work) edit history will provide all the edit information.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:12, 12 April 2012 (UTC)
::::: Well I will comment first that History Merges are notoriously difficult to undo, in some cases may be not possible.  Let me explain how the merge/unmerge process works, because it is not quite as you describe above.  Suppose we want to merge the history of A into B.  First you delete B, then you rename A to B, then you delete B again, then you undelete all the edits from B.  Then you correct the current version B.  
::::: The  consequence of this is that, no where in the database is there a list of edits that originally belonged to A. From the point of view of the database it is as if A never existed.  So you cannot &quot;determine what page was deleted and restore it&quot;.  Instead to undo a history merge you must first delete B again, then undelete just those edits from B that corresponded original to A.  Since this information doesn't exist anywhere outside of being deduced by the admin, you have to go through and examine every individual edit.  It is very tedious.  Then you move B to A.  Then since there are still deleted edits left at the B page, you can undelete it again.  I am pretty sure I have done this here at WB in the past, because I recall trying to tell two pages apart that were very similar to begin with and I found it very difficult to tell which edits originally belonged to A.  Overall, of the tools available to an admin, history merges are the only bit of maintenance that is actually destructive in terms of preserving information (ie which edits originally belonged to A).  
::::: To preform a history merge, you delete the target page.  Move the old page to the target page name, and undelete everything.  Which means you cannot ever go back to the old page name and undelete to look at it's history.  That information is lost.  You can only look at individual edits and try to decide for yourself what belongs to which page. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 21:05, 12 April 2012 (UTC)
:::::: Yes most people do not know these facts. I have made references to that loss of data when calling attention that edit histories may be corrupted (I have seen and called attention to that effects of those administrative actions on the C++ Programming project).
:::::: I'm of the opinion, and have stated it before, that history merges should not be performed by the same administrator that is doing the content merge (or even working on the same project). This seems to be good ethical rule of thumb.
:::::: That was why I also did not comprehend your approach as described in the posts above, it seemed that you were defending a history merge of the source page with multiple destination pages (in the previous post to the above) and to keep redirects with the edit history (in the first and second reply), that would just complicate tracing back the alterations because it can't be applied consistently. That was why see it as a more convoluted approach...
:::::: I haven't seen a reversal of a merge. I have only noticed that type of actions as attempts correct administrative errors in handling page history logs, if my memory does not fail me, I think that your experience was also due to a mishap.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:29, 12 April 2012 (UTC)
::::::: Amidst this conversation about history merges, I feel the key point is in Panic's second reply, which indirectly states that redirects are discouraged. While I found such a position a bit baffling at first, searching project pages led me to [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2006/February#Attention:_Speedy_deletion_of_redirects|this illuminating discussion]] which lends support to it. By now I am inclined to ask for the history merge and forget about the redirect. Even though I will not be completely satisfied with the outcome (link breakage is always nasty, even if it is just on a handful of blogs and mailing list posts as in this case), it does seem to be the saner solution. P.S.: thanks for the clear explanation of history merges Thenub! --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 04:02, 13 April 2012 (UTC)
:::::::: If the link is relevant to the work you can ask the acting admin to preserve it after the history merge (add that to the merge request, ultimately it is up to the admin if it is a valid request). If the redirect is only used by links in talk pages you can ignore that if the post is over 30 days (or you can even fix it it you feel it is important), if it is used in other works or in the work you are merging then it is part of the merge process to fix those or the merge shouldn't be considered complete (because it will indeed break things). Looking into [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Haskell/Class_declarations]] that seems part of the merge process and a issue you will need to address (but for instance the links in this discussion become irrelevant after the task is complete).

{{Outdent|::::::::}} A final idea to deal with my redirect &lt;s&gt;paranoia&lt;/s&gt; worries: would it be acceptable if I &quot;cheated&quot; a little by:
* Asking for the history merge;
* Recreating &quot;Class declarations&quot; afterwards as a redirect; and
* Linking to it from a &quot;meta&quot; page such as [[Haskell/Preserved redirects]], so that in the future admins will know it was retained for some reason?

== Publishing book-writing helper scripts ==

Long ago, the Haskell Wikibook print version used to be generated in a semi-automatic way through a [http://eric.kow.free.fr/download/PrintVersion.hs tiny Haskell script]. I am currently working on improving it; and it would be really convenient to publish new versions of the script here, in a talk page of the book or something of that sort. Sounds great, until you think about licensing - as it is widely known, releasing code under CC licenses or GFDL is a Bad Idea. Is there any reasonable workaround in such a case? (Probably not, I guess, but worth asking anyway.)

P.S.: One thing that might, ''in theory'', solve the problem would be myself being granted uploader rights and then uploading the script as a &quot;public domain&quot; file. In practice, that wouldn't work due to the file extension restrictions, however...

P.P.S.: It would be nice to know of similar situations in the past, if any. Also, please warn me if you feel I am being overzealous... --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 05:33, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

:The problem with the GFDL in software is that it really does not apply well and requires a copy of the license to be included. I do not know of any problem with the CC (and would like to ear your issues with it).&lt;br&gt;
:When you contribute source code to Wikibooks it becomes licensed by the project wide coverage as CCSA30 and GFDL (with limitations, not relevant in this case). You can however state in the code that it is licensed with a less restrictive license like BSD, MIT or even as public domain. The GPL license may be more complex to handle (I haven't really looked into that) but it puts some burden on the use of software that can be seen as contradicting our project licenses (that does no posse any restrictions on use, only attribution and relicensing). IIRC there was (and may still be) some source code on the project that was GPL (I doubt that anyone will use it abusively but if they do they can get into copyright issues with the copyright owners of that code). In any case that is going beyond the point here.
:Solutions are as I indicate, ignore the project's licenses if you use a less restrictive license (or it is public domain, but be sure to state the license/copyright status) or upload it to a service that hosts that type of material and provide a link (sourceforce for instance).
:Uploading locally is an interesting concept but not necessary if it is easier to use one of the previous options, even if it could be interesting for incompatible licenses, for example a license that prevents commercial use. It could probably be explored but I don't think that Wikibooks is the right place to host source code. Feel free to explore that as a proposal if you wish, with good enough reasons I would probably support it.
:To my knowledge (I'm here since 2004) there has never been a discussion around this topic in these terms. I did initiate a similar discussion regarding programming books and the licenses of the source code included. Most code does not have a license indicated even if they are intentioned as public domain, they get license within the project with our licenses, making reuse problematic (especially at the time we only used the GFDL). My view, at times, is that near the copyright attribution of a work it should be clearly stated that if source code does not explicitly state a license it should be considered public domain. Of course this is simply for ease of mind, most code we have (or I have seen) is mostly trivial (but there are exceptions, for example the More C++ Idioms has complex examples and implementations that are explicitly copyrighted), then we have ASM books and Embedded System books that a very small code may be commercial relevant. This type of legal matters is one more thing that I get annoyed by Wikimedia's lack of proper guidelines, because what they provide serves only to legally protect them, not the contributors or the final users.
:In any case this is my general view, I'm not a lawyer. But the solutions above will suffice for your purpose.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:05, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

:PPS: Since you are using transclusion in the print version. I note that there is a &quot;silent&quot; limit on the number (don't know if you have reached it, but look at the end of it to see if something is missing). I put this here so others became also aware of that limitation...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:23, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

:Frankly, I don't see the issue: of course, you can put things under a less restrictive license or into the public domain; see for example Wikimedia Commons. (And I agree with Panic that this should be stated explicitly; I'm doing it on every page of the GLSL Programming book because I know how annoying programming books are that put their code under a license.) I don't know why you would want to upload the Haskell script as a file and not include it as source code in wikitext? Is the typical Haskell programmer not able to use copy&amp;paste? ;) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 06:25, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

::The only issue, it seems, was that my understanding of multi-licensing in Wikibooks was a bit broken, but you guys set the record straight (the main point being, if I understood it correctly, that the CCSA30/GFDL condition does not exclude redistribution under other compatible licenses). As for the practice of &quot;hosting&quot; code here, I agree that it is not a good idea in most cases. Still, IMO it makes sense for small, single-purpose tools that would be only of interest for contributors to a particular book (or ''readers'' of a book - fun suggestion indeed, Panic!). And conversely, if that tiny script eventually grows into something more general moving it elsewhere will be the sane thing to do. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 07:08, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

:::Almost. They do not exclude redistribution under other compatible licenses (if they are indicated). In case of public domain (the copyright is terminated), if you do not indicate it is public domain, because of the &quot;not so smart&quot; move to remove the obligation to add copyright notices it will be presumed as licensed under our license (this may seem unimportant, but in a world that no one speaks for public domain it is important that all public domain has an indication of what it is. As soon as anyone has the only copy of a public domain work they can own the copyright (or if scarce and badly documented they can litigate for control over those that object to the new ownership).

== revocation of editing privileges? ==

I was working on an article.  Since I'm an incremental editor, and since wikibooks is moderated, I placed the page contents in my [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Gzuufy/sandbox sandbox], so the moderator wouldn't be bothered with my flood of incremental edits. This morning I decided to remove all content from my sandbox, seeing how it was supposed to be temporary.  I received the following message: 
:&quot;''Warning: An automated filter has identified this edit as removing all categories from a page, which is potentially unconstructive. Please be aware that vandalism may result in revocation of your editing privileges. If this edit is constructive, please click &quot;Save page&quot; again, and report this error.''&quot;

For a long time I thought no pages were being reviewed by readers.  Because the page: [[Special:RatedPages]] doesn't show any.  But then it was pointed out to me by QU that the main page has something on the order of 160 reviews in the past month.  So the question becomes why is this not showing up as a rated page, and why is there not Page Rating system claim there is not enough data to graph?

Notice, that the extension we are now using is considered obsolete, and has been replaced by the Article Feedback Extension.

If it is on Wikipedia then why is it a copyright violation to put it in Wikibooks?

:By default, when you upload an image on Wikibooks, it is really uploaded at Wikimedia Commons.

However, they do not allow non-free (i.e., fair use) media at WM Commons, which is why they deleted it (according to the WP page, the USPS holds the copyright).  We ''do'' allow fair use materials at WB (as does WP), but we control access to the upload feature.  You can either request the upload capability at [[WB:RFP]] (but you'll have to demonstrate an understanding of the issues involved), or you can request that the image be uploaded for you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Remember [[Wikijunior:Introduction_to_Mathematics/Numbers#More,_less,_and_equal|this lesson]] from Introduction to Mathematics? The equal signs displayed there ''&lt;u&gt;is algebra&lt;/u&gt;''. YES, you don't realize it, but you are trained to solve algebraic equations since Kindergarten or 1st grade, if you are lucky! However, sometimes algebra can be hard, especially with multiple variable algebraic equations.

When is algebra hard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{5*8 \over 10} = x+2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this example, x is 2. However, this is complicated algebra.

&lt;math&gt;1+1=x+1&lt;/math&gt;
Now, if we want to find out x's value, we must equally subtract or add something to both sides. Let's subtract one from both sides, so now we have... &lt;math&gt;{1+1-1=x+1-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which equals &lt;math&gt;{1=x}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Here, 1 is x, so x equals 1.

=BitTorrent &amp; BitCoin=

Are engineers responsible for how people utilize their inventions? History is full of cases that can shed light on this question; however, two recent technologies have made it particularly salient. BitTorrent and BitCoin have very different uses and technical underpinnings; however, both have been condemned for their illegal uses. Neither is inherently bad, but what responsibility falls on the engineer for those who are abusing these technologies?

==BitTorrent==

[[File:The Pirate Bay logo.svg|thumb|right|The Pirate Bay provided links to torrents of copyrighted material.]]
The BitTorrent protocol was created by Bram Cohen in 2001 &lt;ref Name=&quot;TPBtrial&quot; /&gt;. Designed to decentralize information so that data can be distributed more quickly, the protocol breaks each file up into multiple pieces and sends different pieces to each user. The users then share the pieces with each other, reducing the load on the file's original distributor. This technique has been used to solve a number of different engineering problems. Both [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook Facebook] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard Blizzard] have leveraged it to deal with the problems that arise from working on a massive scale. Facebook needs to update thousands of servers all over the world with the latest code, so they use BitTorrent to speed up the process. Similarly, Blizzard uses it to send their game updates to the millions of players who want to download them on the update's release day. 

These cases show the benefits of using Bittorrent in a legal way. However, BitTorrent has become more notorious for its illegal uses, primarily the sharing of copyrighted material. Expanding on the success of previous file sharing solutions [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster Napster] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazaa Kazaa], BitTorrent quickly became one of the most popular ways to share copyrighted material on the internet. A recent study found that BitTorrent traffic once accounted for almost 60% of all internet traffic &lt;ref Name=&quot;InfringingContent&quot; /&gt;.    

However, while many people love the ability to quickly download movies, music, and TV shows, some have taken issue with file sharing. In recent years, the movie and music industries have actively lobbied in Congress on issue of copyright infringement. And while BitTorrent does have many legal uses, one study found that of the 1,000 most popular torrent files, only three were non-infringing content &lt;ref Name=&quot;InfringingContent&quot; /&gt;.
   
Much of the controversy over BitTorrent has centered around [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Bay The Pirate Bay], a Sweden-based BitTorrent search engine. While it does not create the illegal material, The Pirate Bay distributes links to torrents, most of which are of copyrighted content. Still, the website does not take down links to illegal material and flaunts its illegal nature. During the Beijing Olympics, The International Olympic Committee (IOC) asked the Swedish government to prevent clips from being distributed via the Pirate Bay &lt;ref Name=&quot;TPBtrial&quot; /&gt;. In response, not only did the Pirate Bay continue distributing Olympic content, they mockingly changed their logo to “The Beijing Bay” &lt;ref Name=&quot;TPBtrial&quot; /&gt;. In 2009, the case came to a head when they were sued for copyright infringement on a variety of movies, shows, and games &lt;ref Name=&quot;TPBtrial&quot; /&gt;. The founders of Pirate Bay were sentenced to one year in prison and fined 30 million Swedish kronor, which is $4.4 million &lt;ref Name=&quot;TPBtrial&quot; /&gt;. They appealed the decision to the Swedish Supreme Court but were ultimately found guilty in February 2012 &lt;ref Name=&quot;supremecourt&quot; /&gt;. 
     
In contrast to the founders of The Pirate Bay, Bram Cohen never faced legal issues, because his company never distributed links to unlicensed material. In response to a question about copyright issues, he stated
{{Quote|text=It’s completely legal to create technical solutions. The reason people get dragged into legal proceedings is that they break copyright laws, which I have never done.|sign=Bram Cohen&lt;ref Name=&quot;quote&quot; /&gt;}}

==BitCoin==
[[File:Bitcoin_logo.svg|right]]
BitCoin, released as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software open-source software] on January 3, 2009, is a distributed electronic currency designed and developed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto is very likely a pseudonym, and his true identity is unknown &lt;ref Name=&quot;Nakamoto&quot; /&gt;. He left the project in 2010; however, even in his absence, BitCoin has become a real currency that is used for a variety of purposes, both legal and illegal &lt;ref Name=&quot;Nakamoto_IRC&quot; /&gt;.

[[File:total bitcoins over time.png|thumb|right|Expected number of BitCoins over time.]]
Bitcoin utilizes a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system proof-of-work system] to mathematically ensure the scarcity of the currency. Computers &quot;mine&quot; BitCoins by solving a series of increasingly hard problems. The first computer to solve the problem sends out a solution, which is exchanged for BitCoins. This exchange rate varies over time. As more solutions are found, less Bitcoins are granted for each solution. These two constraints cap the total number of Bitcoins that can ever exist at 21 million &lt;ref Name=&quot;ArsTechnica&quot;/&gt;. As of 2012, almost 9 million Bitcoins have been mined &lt;ref Name=&quot;BitcoinCount&quot;/&gt;. The scarcity of BitCoins stems from the expense of processing power. Not only does mining BitCoins require powerful computers, those computers consume large amounts of energy. In fact, in Canada, the homes of several people mining BitCoins were searched because they were consuming so much electricity that the police thought they must have been growing marijuana &lt;ref Name=&quot;CanadaArrests&quot;/&gt;.

The biggest advantage of BitCoin is that is decentralized; no authority can issue more BitCoins &lt;ref Name=&quot;ArsTechnica&quot;/&gt;. This makes inflation difficult, because the supply of BitCoins in the market cannot arbitrarily be increased. This kind of certainty appeals to many people as it removes the control of governments from the currency. Unlike when using a bank, there are no service fees associated with BitCoin, making it more profitable for businesses. Some brick-and-mortar stores have begun accepting BitCoins for purchases &lt;ref Name=&quot;TechFortune&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref Name=&quot;BitcoinTravel&quot; /&gt;.

All BitCoin transactions are inherently public. However, there is no information about why a transaction was made or who the transaction was made between. This anonymity makes BitCoin the first untraceable electronic currency &lt;ref Name=&quot;Guardian&quot; /&gt;. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(anonymous_marketplace) The Silk Road] is an anonymous marketplace which, much like eBay, allows users to buy and sell basically anything from each other. However, the Silk Road only accepts exchanges in BitCoin and is hidden behind the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network) Tor] network &lt;ref Name=&quot;UsingTheSilkRoad&quot; /&gt;. This means buyers and sellers can market illegal goods without the fear of being discovered by federal agencies. This has made the site very popular, and has allowed the sale of illegal drugs over the internet &lt;ref Name=&quot;NPR&quot; /&gt;. Even if law enforcement agencies were to make fake postings to lure out buyers, because the transactions are anonymous and untraceable, it would be impossible to know who placed the order, regardless of the address to which it was sent.

In June 2011, senators [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Schumer Charles Schumer] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin Joe Manchin] asked the Drug Enforcement Administration to launch a full-scale investigation into The Silk Road &lt;ref Name=&quot;NPR&quot; /&gt;. Around the same time, [http://gawker.com/5805928/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imaginable a Gawker article in 2011] received over 175,000 Facebook likes and further brought attention to this issue, causing the exchange rate of Bitcoin to skyrocket &lt;ref Name=&quot;BitcoinCharts&quot; /&gt;. However, the distributed and antonymous nature of BitCoin has made it difficult for the government to take any action against The Silk Road. During the summer of 2011, the exchange rate on BitCoin skyrocketed to $30 per BTC &lt;ref Name=&quot;BitcoinCharts&quot; /&gt;. As of 2012, it has come down to be relatively stable at around $5 per BTC &lt;ref Name=&quot;BitcoinCharts&quot; /&gt;.

==Professionalism and Ethics==
These two cases expose a core question in engineering ethics: are professional engineers responsible for what others do with their inventions? In the case of both BitTorrent and BitCoin, the law comes down fairly clearly. Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, continues to run his company completely legally in the United States. He has never been accused of copyright infringement, and probably will never be. Cohen's company simply provides the BitTorrent technology and assists other companies in implementing it to legally solve engineering problems. On the other hand, the creators of The Pirate Bay received prison sentences and a massive fine from the Swedish government. The Pirate Bay crossed a legal line when they encouraged users to pirate copyrighted content by knowingly allowing them to post these illegal torrents. As we saw with the footage of the Beijing Olympics, even when asked to remove this content, they refused. 

Similarly to Cohen, Nakamoto would likely not face legal action, even if his identity were known. However, the US government has publicly condemned The Silk Road, and, were it possible to do so, would certainly bring legal action against both its creators and users. Here we see the same legal line. Creating, mining, and transferring BitCoin is thus far legal; however, knowingly allowing users to sell illegal goods with BitCoin is a crime. However, the law is not the only guide for ethics, and it may sometimes be necessary to take a stronger stance than law requires.

It is difficult to fully condemn Cohen or Nakamoto, as they did not directly do any harm. These two cases also have a high amount of gray area; many would argue that neither piracy nor recreational drug use should be illegal. However, technology is very multipurpose and it would benefit engineers to consider in advance how their creations will be used. Ultimately, our guiding question, are professional engineers responsible for what others do with their inventions, is a personal one and must be answered individually. Hopefully these two cases can provide a starting point for that introspection.

== '''Choose a “Fruit of the Spirit” from Galatians 5:22-23''' ==


The fruits are:  love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. N.I.V.

You might use this Objective Lesson to show the difference between a good fruit and a bad fruit [http://www.kidssundayschool.com/Gradeschool/Objects/1object04.php Known By Our Fruits]

==== KNOWN BY OUR FRUITS ====

What would you rather eat a rotten banana or one that is nice and ripe?

''Materials:'' 

* One rotten banana 
* One good banana

''What you will do during class:''

You will show the children the bad banana first and get their reaction. Then you will display the good banana and get a different reaction. This Object Talk will help the children know the difference between producing good fruit and bad fruit in their daily walk with Christ.

''What you will say:'' 

As you show everyone the bad rotten banana ask, &quot;Who would like to eat this banana? Why would you choose not to eat it? How can you tell this banana will not taste very good?&quot; Then show everyone the good banana and ask, &quot;Now who would like to eat this banana? Why would you choose to eat it? How can you tell this banana will taste good? Our lives are like one of these two pieces of fruit. People will know who we are by the type of fruit we produce. Matthew 7:20 say 'Thus by their fruit you will recognize them'. What kind of fruit do you want to produce? Will the fruit of your life be good, like this good banana, or not so good, like this rotten banana?&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Pythagorean.svg|400px|right]]
The '''Pythagorean theorem''' is the theory that the sum of the square areas of sides A and B add up to the hypotenuse, or C's square area. It's formula is described as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are many reasons to prove this correct; you may find them on [[wikipedia:Pythagorean_theorem|Wikipedia]]. However, there is more than just this equation, called the ''Pythagorean equation''.

== Pythagorean triples ==
Pythagorean triples are three sets of positive whole numbers that can make a perfect triangle.

Take the image on the right. Pretend (A) is 3 and (B) is 4. What is (C)? (Hint: C is the hypotenuse; the longest side on the picture.) Use the Pythagorean equation to figure it out! (Click on the reference link to see the answer!)&lt;ref name=&quot;PythTriple3-4-5&quot;&gt;Please highlight to your right: &lt;span style=&quot;color:white;&quot;&gt;(C) is 5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, let's try the Pythagorean equation backwards! Now, (B) is 12 and (C) is 13. Please figure out (A).&lt;ref name=&quot;PythTriple5-12-13&quot;&gt;Please highlight to your right: &lt;span style=&quot;color:white;&quot;&gt;(A) is 5. AGAIN?! Oh man, this is cheap! (Actually, no it's not.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Added material on SPM DICOM Import, linked to dcm2nii</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">SPM has a DICOM conversion utility that works with many different variations of the DICOM format (though probably not all... If you encounter problems, see below or try asking for help on the [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/support/ SPM Email List]). If you access the conversion tool via the button &quot;DICOM Import&quot;, you will be immediately prompted to select the DICOM files, with default options for the converted output. If you want more control (e.g. a choice of '.nii' or '.img/.hdr' output format) then access the tool via the batch system's menu:
 SPM -&gt; Util -&gt; DICOM Import

==Other software==

If you have problems with SPM's DICOM Import, popular alternatives include:
* [http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/dcm2nii.html dcm2nii] by Chris Rorden, (part of the image viewer [http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron MRIcron])
* [http://lcni.uoregon.edu/%7Ejolinda/MRIConvert/ MRIConvert] by Jolinda Smith

At the bottom of the webpage for [http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/dcm2nii.html dcm2nii] there is a longer list of alternative DICOM conversion tools.

&lt;!-- Categories and interwikis go at the bottom of this page. --&gt;

=== Usage ===
*1st parameter is the Mongolian (Todo, Manchu, Sibe) text to display
*2nd parameter is optional; if it is 'h' then the text is laid out horizontally; if it is any other value (e.g. 'v'), or if it is omitted then the text is laid out vertically (if the browser supports vertical layout)

=== Examples ===
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces: {{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ}}
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|v}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces: {{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|v}}
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|h}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces: {{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|h}}
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ&lt;br/&gt;ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|v}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces: {{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ&lt;br/&gt;ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|v}}

=== Issues ===
Currently only IE8 and above and Chrome version 17 and later support rendering the text in top-to-bottom, left-to-right format. The browsers Firefox, Opera and Safari will render the text as left-to-right, top-to-bottom. See also
* http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-writing-modes/
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145503

For Webkit and Firefox nightlies, it seems &lt;pre&gt;-webkit-writing-mode:vertical-lr;-moz-writing-mode:vertical-lr;&lt;/pre&gt; works, but there are so many rendering issues, that they are probably better off not being enabled yet.

For MediaWiki issues regarding this: [[bugzilla:9436]]

==== Non-Font ====
When Daicing font set to be the EUDC, 
* ZERO WIDTH JOINER at the head-place does not work. 
* NIRUGU does not work.t
* NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE deos not work.

==== Font issues ====
:* &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt;=Founder's &lt;tt&gt;Mongolian Baiti&lt;/tt&gt;, is a font for Hudum, Todo, Manchu and Sibe;
:* &lt;tt&gt;MU&lt;/tt&gt;=Monotype Drawing Office's &lt;tt&gt;Mongol Usug&lt;/tt&gt;, is a font for Hudum and Todo;
:* &lt;tt&gt;MS&lt;/tt&gt;=Myatav Erdenechimeg's &lt;tt&gt;MongolianScript&lt;/tt&gt;, is a font for Hudum only;
:* &lt;tt&gt;DW&lt;/tt&gt;=&lt;tt&gt;Daicing White&lt;/tt&gt;, is a font for Manchu, Sibe and Daur.
# &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt; 5.00 does not match Unicode Standard, please upgrade it to &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt; 5.01 (KB929763);
# Under certain situations {{MongolUnicode|‍ᠶ‍}} is incorrectly rendered as {{MongolUnicode|‍ᠢ‍}}&lt;!--Middle form--&gt; or {{MongolUnicode|ᠵ‍}}&lt;!--Head form--&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt; 5.01 and &lt;tt&gt;MU&lt;/tt&gt; 2.37;
# {{MongolUnicode|ᡓ‍}} is incorrectly rendered as {{MongolUnicode|ᠴ‍}} in &lt;tt&gt;MU&lt;/tt&gt; 2.37;
# &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt; 5.01 does not render {{MongolUnicode|ᡯᡳ}} correctly (we may use {{MongolUnicode|ᡯᡳ᠌}} instead in &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt;).

When thinking about computers in health care, the first things that come to mind are usually the positive benefits of electronic patient charts and speedy prescription delivery. But there are some disadvantages to being around computers all day. Repetitive stress injuries are injuries in which hand, wrist, shoulder, or neck pain is caused by performing the same physical movements over and over again. So by using the computers keyboard at the inappropriate angle or using the wrong technique will cause RSI’s or carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a painful and crippling condition affecting the hands and wrists. A computer users eyes can also be affected and they could develop something called computer vision syndrome. Some common symptoms of CVS are eyestrain or fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, light sensitivity, blurred vision, headaches, and pain in the shoulders neck and back. All of these problems can be alleviated by the correct use of ergonomics. Ergonomics is the science of fitting a work environment to the people who work there. For instance, to prevent RSI’s, the computer user should make sure the computer and wrists are held at the right angle to prevent injuries. They should also take breaks from working on the computer and do wrist, hand, neck and back exercises. CVS injuries can be prevented by taking frequent breaks form looking at a computer screen.  
{{BookCat}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Computers in a medical field area such as Nursing, is now a much needed device. Most hospitals are up and running off of computers that help nurses and doctors enter patient history. Because there is such a need, there are now requirements that have been set forth by OSHA to protect medical staff. The irony of working in a hospital, is that the staff may also be the patient. In such cases where this may occur do to a computer related injury for example are carpal tunnel syndrome and back issues. Standards have been put into place to ease into proper usage of computer based hardware. OSHA requires that all medical staff have training for usage of hardware such as computers that will fit in the field with proper body alignment. OSHA has a software based training option that will teach medical staff for proper ergonomics. OSHA also has specific rights for an employee. According to The Online Journal of Nursing Informatics &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://ojni.org/12_3/elkind.pdf], Online Journal of Nursing Informatics.&lt;/ref&gt;, the following rights were created specifically for nurses and medical staff.&lt;br /&gt;

1) the right number of computers &lt;br /&gt; 
2) available at the right locations &lt;br /&gt;
3) viewable at the right height &lt;br /&gt;
4) with the right size monitor &lt;br /&gt;
5) set to the right resolution &lt;br /&gt;

If you're wondering what horizon A is, here's your answer: horizon A refers to the upper layer of soil, nearest the surface. It is commonly known as topsoil. In the woods or other areas that have not been plowed or tilled, this layer would probably include organic litter, such as fallen leaves and twigs . The litter helps prevent erosion, holds moisture, and decays to form a very rich soil known as humus. Horizon A provides plants with nutrients they need for a great life.

The layer below horizon A, of course, has to be horizon B. Litter is not present in horizon B and therefore there is much less humus. Horizon B does contain some elements from horizon A because of the process of leaching. Leaching resembles what happens in a coffee pot as the water drips through the coffee grounds. Leaching may also bring some minerals from horizon B down to horizon C.

If horizon B is below horizon A, then horizon C must be below horizon B. Horizon C consists mostly of weatherized big rocks. This solid rock, as you discovered in Soil Formation, gave rise to the horizons above it.

Soil profiles look different in different areas of the world. They are affected by climate and other things. Click here to see three different soil profiles.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Anonymous Sources and the Public Sphere==

The media is essential to the public sphere, informing people who cannot remain constantly active in discussion. Journalism acts as a watchdog force to help the people regulate the government and any other force that threatens the well-being of the whole. Journalists are often the subject of scrutiny from the public, and the pressure to tell the truth weighs heavily on their shoulders. Burdened with this truth, members of the press often fight to release truth and take all necessary measures to uncover it. Occasionally, a journalist will receive information or a tip from a source that wants to remain anonymous. Approached with this dilemma, there are many steps that can be taken to ensure that the information is truthful and still serve the public sphere properly without deception. While some argue that the use of anonymous sources is detrimental to the public sphere, they ignore the benefits and how, when conducted in a proper manner, anonymous sources have proved to be worth the secrecy. 

===Anonymity Allowed===
[[File:Associated Press logo 2012.svg|thumb|Associated Press logo 2012]] Anonymity, when granted, is not granted without careful deliberation. Sources that remained anonymous are reviewed by not only the writer, but also multiple editors within the publication. The Associated Press Style Book, which all major news sources follow and adhere to, dedicates an entire [page length] to the use of anonymous sources. “Use anonymous sources on when essential and even then provide the most specific identification of the source”&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. Associated Press Style Book. 2004 and 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; (AP Style book 2004). With the increasing development of web sources and online news outlets, AP amended the entry on anonymous sources in 2009, elimitolnating evident loop holes. The new guideline specifies that the source must go through the approval of the news manager, must provide fact not opinion, be reliable and in a position to give accurate information and finally the information is only available through that source. Journalists also have the obligation to look deeply at the sources motives for revealing information and why they are so adamant about remaining anonymous. These changes mirror the shift mood in society, where people want to know where their news is coming from and have become more skeptical of those who wish to remain anonymous.

The benefits of remaining anonymous are wide spread, benefiting both the public and the source. In terms of the source, anonymity allows them to say what is necessary without fear of admonishment or penalty. This is often the case when a government employee steps forward to reveal a scandal or a terrible thing that is happening behind closed doors. Whistle-blowers, like Deep Throat in the Watergate Scandal, are rare and should be valued for their courage to approach the media with such vital information.  Other sources conceal their identities for fear of retaliation from their employers or the people they revealed stuff about.

===Reason to Remain Anonymous===
Clark Hoyt, a public editor (or ombudsman) for the New York Times, offered some comments on how a reporter used an anonymous source in providing a character reference for a suspected killer. ”Washington… is a city steeped in the culture of anonymity”&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, Clark. “No Comment. But You Didn’t Hear it from Me”  New York Times. 28 Mar 2009. www.nytimes.com. 25 April 2013. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/opinion/29pubed.html?ref=anonymoussources&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;. Hoyt describes how official spokesmen have asked to be on background or off the record to add information but will formally be presented on that they had no comment.  He offers an insight to why employees or government officials will ask to be off the record:[[File:The New York Times.svg|thumb|The New York Times]]
* All glory is supposed to go to the boss
* They disagree with the boss and are afraid of getting fired; they are talking about classified information and could be prosecuted
* They want to promote a policy, or kill it, by getting it out before it is officially announced
* They believe the public has a right to know about something that is being suppressed.
These are the reasons why anonymous sources should remain anonymous, when they are serving a positive purpose to the public. The Society of Professional Journalist has a widely published and used ethics code. Similar to the AP Style book, it is a source of reference in all types of news outlets. While not mandated, it is the ethics code that is most commonly followed. The code leads with the title Seek Truth and Report it, the overarching role of journalism in the public sphere is also encompassed in this simple title.  In regards to anonymity, the code states “Identify sources whenever feasible. The public is entitled to as much information as possible on a sources’ reliability.”&lt;ref&gt;Society of Professional Journalist. SPJ Code of Ethics. 1996. http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp?mobile=no&lt;/ref&gt;  The news industry was built to expose truths and keep the public informed and involved in the public sphere. SPJ upholds these values to this day, instilling the accountability in being a journalist. SPJ also encourages the deeper search into what prompted the request for anonymity; “Always question sources’ motives before promising anonymity. Clarify conditions attached to any promise made in exchange for information. Keep promises.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Society of Professional Journalist. SPJ Code of Ethics. 1996. http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp?mobile=no&lt;/ref&gt; This boils down to knowing before the interview that the source wants to remain anonymous and to delve into the background of the source, eliminating any who could personal vendettas against a company or person. This responsibility is solely on the shoulders of the journalist and their editors, if they unknowingly release falsified information to the public there are repercussions.

===Anonymous Submissions===
In newspapers and website, there are often published anonymous submissions and questions. While the internet is free-ranging and often almost anyone can publish things to an open forum blog, the newspapers hold the responsibility for what they send to the presses. An example in a smaller scaled public sphere is The Breeze at JMU. The Darts and Pats portion of the paper are comments submitted by anybody through an anonymous message. Through this, students have bravely voiced their opinions about anything on campus. Often these Darts and Pats are the talk of the school, while the sources remain securely anonymous. The difference between the publishing online and in the paper is the rigorous editing process that comments go through to filter out inappropriate or highly inflammatory submission. The internet often has no specific filter to prevent those types of messages. Also the quality of the postings weigh on the newspaper (or any other media that allows this type of publishing), forming a type of accountability for the release of statement.
Anonymous Source is a website dedicated to “examining the merits of unnamed sourcing in journalism and anonymity in public discourse.”&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Matt J.  Anonymous Sources. http://www.anonymoussources.org/?p=37&lt;/ref&gt; Author and creator, Matt Duffy, runs the blog to actively discuss the use and misuse of unnamed sources in journalism.  He reviews the effect of keeping sources anonymous. Blogger Glenn Greenwald wrote “Unjustified anonymity — especially when mindlessly repeating what shielded government sources claim in secret — is the single greatest enabler of false and deceitful ‘reporting.’”&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, Glenn. “The fundamental unreliability of America’s media: the proliferation of anonymity ensures pervasive falsehoods.” Salon. 12, Jan. 2010. http://www.salon.com/2010/01/12/media_254/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism on Anonymity===
Anonymous source, while not having to worry about the retaliation of bosses or peers, also do not have to take responsibility for their words. In the blog sphere, comments on news stories or candidates are not monitored; therefore someone could go about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet) trolling] various stories or sites, instigating arguments and harming feelings while experiencing none of the repercussions associated with announcing it in public. This type of anonymity is more detrimental than that which is regulated through writers and editors who have an obligation to report misdoings in the government and other public sectors that contribute to the public sphere.
The journalist obligation often gets twisted when news sources prescribe to a specific partisan group, as many news sources are accused of doing now. The lack of bias in the news makes the use of anonymous source even more perilous. The sources could be used to push a political agenda without attributing the actions or words to a specific person. The viewer/reader does not have the verification that this was said by a trusted official or if it was simply manipulated to forward debates in a particular topic. If there is no objective sense of journalism presenting the truth to the public, than anonymous sources are just a piece of the deception.

There are times in this country’s history when anonymous sources have burst the bubble and opened America’s eyes to terrible things happening in our society. Not all the sources have amounted to this type of servitude to the public, most have hinder the public in ways that have caused several news organizations to ban the use of unnamed sources from their publications. “Major news organizations--including USA Today, the New York Times and the Washington Post--have tightened their anonymous sources policies.”&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, Alicia C. “Anonymous Sources” American Journalism Review (1994). ajr.org. Web. 25. Apr. 2013. http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1596.&lt;/ref&gt; Cases where journalist have used anonymous sources and refuse to break the confidentiality agreement have been fined or jailed.

===Conclusion===
The public sphere uses journalism as a watchdog for the government and other harmful corporations.  While people grow skeptical about it’s ability to present fact equally and without bias, they still rely on the media to present them with the discussion topics and the news daily. Being the watchdog does not come easy, especially when there is limited access to information and sources. While people often fear what can’t be verified and what is not known, the use of anonymous sources often open’s the public’s eyes about problems that are happening right under their noses. Anonymity can breed negative things, like trolling and the ability to lie without consequence.  Farhad Manjooo talks about truth and how it is a relative matter in the modern era. People see anonymity as untrustworthy and secretive, but it can be helpful and the only way to discover the truth under a mountain of government deceit. However, with proper vetting and researching, journalist can provide valuable

==Rupert Murdoch==

Transparency in an open government is often credited with generating government accountability.  In a democracy, transparency allows citizens to control their government, reducing government corruption and bribery.  However, when transparency and accountability are placed in powerful hands, a society can become astray.  In Rupert Murdoch’s case, too much power with little accountability led to illegal telephone hacking that exposed the private lives of citizens, soldiers, celebrities, and the Royal Family.  In our world of advanced media technology, how much is too much information?  How can our [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere public sphere] continue to influence political action with unethical probes from media conglomerates?  As Murdoch recently demonstrated, and continues to illustrate, too much power in one hand can cause massive disturbances in the public sphere.

===Murdoch and News Corporation===

[[File:Rupert Murdoch - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009.jpg|thumb|Rupert Murdoch - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009]]Rupert Murdoch was born in Australia in 1931.  After years of owning newspapers and one music label in Australia, Murdoch turned his sights to Britain.  After acquiring ''News of the World'' in 1968 he also bought the failing newspaper ''The Sun''.  Moving to the United States in 1979, Murdoch created and launched News Corporation.  In 1981, he bought the struggling ''Times'' and ''Sunday Times'' from a Canadian newspaper publisher &lt;ref name=&quot;The Week&quot;/&gt;.  On September 4 1985, Murdoch became a naturalized citizen to satisfy the legal requirement that only United States citizens could own American television stations.  In 1986, the Fox Broadcasting Station was launched, and venturing into new publishing technologies, Murdoch bought Twentieth Century Fox, Harper Collins in 1989, and ''The Wall Street Journal'' in 2007 &lt;ref name=&quot;The Week&quot;/&gt;.  Now as an 81-year-old, Murdoch owns the second largest media conglomerate, News Corporation.  By 2000, Murdoch’s News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries with a net worth of over five billion dollars &lt;ref name=&quot;News Corp&quot;&gt;&quot;News Corporation.&quot; . Wikipedia, 02 May 2012. Web. 28 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.


As one of the most powerful and influential media companies in the world, News Corporation has the responsibility to abide by the rules of ethics and to be as fair and balanced with their information as possible.  NewsCorp produces books, cable programming, films, magazines, newspapers, television, websites, and sporting events &lt;ref name=&quot;News Corp&quot;/&gt;.  NewsCorp affects the entire media world and because of this influence, accountability for illegal actions is crucial in a company as powerful as NewsCorp.  One of the first purchases Murdoch made was ''News of the World'', and NewsCorp continued to own and run the newspaper in Britain for more than 30 years until its last publication in 2011 &lt;ref name=&quot;News Corp&quot;/&gt;.  ''News of the World'', once a credible newspaper, was turned into a tabloid newspaper once controlled by NewsCorp &lt;ref name=&quot;News of the World&quot;&gt;&quot;News of the world.&quot; . Wikipedia, 2012. Web. 29 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; .  Most of the newspaper consists of minimal writing, with large images that aim to capture celebrity and political scandals.  This aggressive journalism, along with the goal to expose shocking stories first, led to the demise and legal troubles of the historic newspaper.

===Political Influence of News Corporation===

[[File:Rupert Murdoch apology letter.jpg|thumb|Rupert Murdoch's apology letter to victims of the ''News of the World'''s hacking scandal]]

Murdoch built his media empire on newspapers and now one, with increasing evidence against ''News of the World'', could lead to his eternal downfall.  With a scandal as complicated as phone hacking, and a company as large as NewsCorp, new doors of corruption are being opened as soon as one has been shut.  The developing scandal is quite entertaining, but to fully understand the impact of this treachery, one must dive deeper into the affect it has had on our world politics and police control.  Only then, when we see the full extent of NewsCorp’s influence, will we understand how dangerous powerful media can be to our everyday lives.  

At the beginning of the year 2003, Andrew Coulson became the editor of ''News of the World'' &lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;&gt;Walters, Simon. &quot;Rebekah vetoed BBC man and told Cameron he should give No10 job to Andy Coulson .&quot; Mail Online. (2011): n. page. Web. 29 April. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; .  Two years later, in November of 2005, a story was published regarding confidential information about Prince William and due to the personal nature of the story, the Royal Family launched a police investigation of ''News of the World'', and the illegal tactics they had used to retrieve the information.  In 2007, Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator for ''News of the World'' and Clive Goodman, the royal-family editor at ''News of the World'' are jailed for four and six months on counts of phone-hacking &lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;/&gt;.  Later, Coulson resigns as editor, claiming full responsibility for the hacking, but denying any knowledge of it.  A few months later, Coulson is hired as communications director for the Conservative Party and its leader, David Cameron &lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;/&gt;.  

The hiring of Coulson to Cameron’s campaign was no coincidence.  Rebekah Brooks, former boss of News International and subsidiary of News Corporation, highly recommended Coulson for the job because he was “acceptable” to News International &lt;ref name=&quot;The Week&quot;/&gt;.  Although Cameron was leaning toward BBC senior journalist Guto Harri as his media director, Brooks ultimately helped make the decision to hire Coulson &lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;/&gt;.  Brooks said, “If you find something for Andy we will return the favour.”  In 2009, after continuing investigations into the phone hacking scandal, and Coulson still on the chopping block, News Corporation’s ''The Sun'' and ''News of the World'' abandoned support for Gordon Brown and switched to David Cameron &lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;/&gt;.  

Many people questioned the sudden move from Brown to Cameron.  Were political party leaders being swayed to hire individuals for support from the top media conglomerates?  Coulson, although he was arrested in April of 2012 for phone hacking, was Cameron’s media director for more than three years.  After his arrest, it was found that News International was paying Coulson while he was part of the Cameron campaign.  The interference and persuasion of media moguls in the political sphere is dangerous.  Powerful individuals are only looking to benefit themselves and their companies, not the countries needs.

===Police Corruption and Operation Weeting===
Although the political persuasion seems corrupt enough, during the investigations of the phone hacking scandal, it was found that ''News of the World'' was paying off and bribing police officers to silence investigations of phone and computer hacking while also using corrupt police officers to gain private information for articles &lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;Staff and Agencies, . &quot;Phone-hacking scandal: arrest timeline.&quot; Guardian. N.p., 2012.	Web. 29 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Operation Weeting was launched through the Metropolitan Police Service regarding the accusations of phone hacking, and the operation is being conducted alongside Operation Elveden &lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt;.  The operation is an investigation into allegations of inappropriate payments to the police by those involved with phone hacking.  With 90 police officers involved with Operation Weeting, it was found that around 3,000 people had their phones hacked &lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt;.  During the investigations, documentation provided to Operation Weeting suggested that some police personnel might have accepted &quot;inappropriate payments&quot; from news organizations in return for classified information.  In total, as of March 13, 2012, a total of 23 people have been arrested as part of Operation Weeting &lt;ref name=&quot;The Week&quot;&gt;&quot;Rupert Murdoch's phone hacking scandal: A timeline.&quot; The Week. (2012): 1-3. Web.	April. 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.  

The investigation continues today, with Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch (his son), and Rebekah Brooks as main targets of the investigation.  In July of 2011, amidst the phone hacking scandal, Murdoch announced that ''News of the World'' would end its 128 yearlong publication &lt;ref name=&quot;The Week&quot;/&gt;.  Although many found this change positive for Britain, less than a year later, Murdoch announced he was creating ''The Sun on Sunday'', widely seen as the successor of ''News of the World''.

===News Corporation and the Public Sphere===
Everyday there are new updates on the controversy and Murdoch continues to be the center of attention in media news.  Although the focus is centered on British media, News Corporation owns many influential outlets in America.  One of the most prominent and conservative is Fox News.  Before we believe everything we hear in the news, we need to check the sources and the power and money behind those sources.  Rupert Murdoch is at the top of the food chain and by getting an inside look at the inner workings of his companies, we can begin to identify his agendas as a top media mogul.  

The public sphere is affected by the media, and it is our job as educated and enlightened citizens to control what our government and media does.  How much longer will we stand by while media conglomerates sway our politics for their own personal agendas?  How have we allowed one corporation to gain so much power over our media, and consequently gain power over our everyday lives?

==Whistleblowers==
An increased discussion of government transparency in recent years has led to the creation of various laws and agencies seeking to decrease abuse of power and increase honesty about political action. These laws and agencies serve to protect individuals who seek to bring to light misinformation, scandals, or cover-ups. These individuals, referred to as “whistleblowers,” are typically members of organizations, corporations, or governments which the individual in question sees as guilty of some crime or wrongdoing. In a functioning democracy, it is necessary for citizens to be able to report these wrongdoings without fear of undue retribution. However, though whistleblowing is protected under United States law, the actions of these alarmists are rarely without consequence. The United States Office of Special Counsel (OSC), which serves to protect the rights of whistleblowers who speak out specifically against certain members or bureaus of the government, has been involved in multiple investigations and scandals. This has led to a decreased ability of the OSC to protect American citizens and an increased amount of wrongly punished civil servants. 

===Protection under U.S. Law===
In 1989, the US government passed the Whistleblower Protection Act, seeking to protect workers of federal agencies who decide to expose misconduct. If any employee discloses evidence of “a violation of a law, rule or regulation; gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety,” the federal agency employing them is unable to threaten them with termination of employment, wage garnishment, or other penalties&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sec.gov/eeoinfo/ whistleblowers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.  This process is overseen by the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), which was formed in 1979 as an independent agency responsible for investigating and prosecuting federal misconduct.  The OSC serves to uphold three other statutes as well as the Whistleblower Protection Act, which include the Civil Service Reform Act, the Hatch Act, and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act. The Hatch Act, specifically, serves to prevent civil servants from engaging in partisan political activity. The Whistleblower Protection Act, therefore, is often intertwined in cases regarding the Hatch Act, as many cases of whistleblowing concern partisan activity.

===Scott Bloch Controversy===
[[File:Scott-Bloch.jpg|frame|right|Scott J. Bloch, former United States Special Counsel]]
Scott J. Bloch was appointed as United States Special Counsel (overseeing the OSC) by George W. Bush in late 2003. However, his term as U.S. Special Counsel was marred by multiple acts of wrongdoing, partially involving the silencing of the very act of whistleblowing which he was supposed to protect. 
	In one of his first motions as U. S. Special Counsel, Bloch ordered the removal of all mentions of sexual orientation nondiscrimination from all OSC materials, claiming the OSC had no authority to ban this type of discrimination&lt;ref&gt;Chibbaro Jr., Lou. &quot;Gay federal workers fear for jobs.&quot; New York Blade 20 Feb. 2004: 22. EDS Foundation Index. Web. 29 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Bloch’s reputation as anti-gay was deepened when gay whistleblower Michael Levine’s case against a coworker at the U.S. Forest Service was dropped without investigation. Levine reported his case to the OSC after he had been falsely accused of possessing child pornography and was suspended for fourteen days. According to Levine, this retaliation was caused by his whistleblowing when he reported a coworker for running a sporting goods business from the government property where they worked&lt;ref&gt;Kuhr, Fred. &quot;A Blind Eye To Discrimination.&quot; Advocate (Los Angeles, Calif.) (2005): 32-33. OmniFile Full Text Mega (H.W. Wilson). Web. 29 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Levine, expecting the OSC to  protect his right to expose government abuse under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, was shocked to see his case dismissed after a year of inaction by the OSC. 
The media and Congress officials, most notably Congressmen Barney Frank and Tammy Baldwin, were quick to draw a connection between the dismissal of Levine’s case and Bloch’s preceding elimination of anti-discrimination rules applying to homosexual employees &lt;ref&gt;Kuhr, Fred. &quot;A Blind Eye To Discrimination.&quot; Advocate (Los Angeles, Calif.) (2005): 32-33. OmniFile Full Text Mega (H.W. Wilson). Web. 29 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the major complaint against Bloch was that his obvious agenda destroyed the non-partisan nature of the OSC, making it difficult (or, in Levine’s case, impossible) for workers to blow the whistle on their supervisors or fellow employees.

===Whistleblowing within Corporations===
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is somewhat of a corporation version of the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, also known as SOX, sought to decrease scandals and abuses of power within corporations. The act was triggered by the Enron scandal, which involved systematic fraud and intense corporate corruption&lt;ref&gt;Lucci, John Paul. &quot;Enron-The Bankruptcy Heard Around The World And The International Ricochet Of Sarbanes-Oxley.&quot; Albany Law Review 67.1 (2003): 211-249. Academic Search Complete. Web. 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  
Interestingly, SOX Section 1107 specifically lists criminal penalties for those who are found to obstruct the act of whistleblowing within a corporation. Specifically, any individual who “knowingly, with the intent to retaliate, takes any action harmful to any person, including interference with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person, for providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any federal offense, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.” In other words, no corporation is allowed to retaliate against an employee who rightfully reports abuses, scandals, or violations of federal law within a corporation. Naturally, many corporations spoke out against the SOX, claiming that the implementation of a government channel for reporting abuse would unfairly increase the volume of whistleblowing. This, of course, would have the potential to increase the volume of government prosecutions of corporations&lt;ref&gt;HOFMANN, MARK A. &quot;Whistle-Blower Rewards Add To Corporate Woes.&quot; Business Insurance 45.25 (2011): 6-20. Business Source Complete. Web. 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Though there was initially backlash from many major corporations about the implementation of this whistleblower protection law, it has already become a valuable addition to America’s corporate landscape. In 2011, Bank of America was found to have violated Section 1107 of SOX when an employee who reported abuse was fired&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Osha Says Bofa Broke Whistleblower Law.&quot; Pratt's Bank Law &amp; Regulatory Report 17.10 (2011): 14-15. Business Source Complete. Web. 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The employee was terminated from her position at Countrywide Financial Corporation (part of Bank of America) after reporting wire, mail, and bank fraud to the employee relations department&lt;ref&gt;15&lt;/ref&gt;.  The case was taken up by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which deals with violations of SOX provisions. The employee was reimbursed for “back wages, interest, compensatory damages, and attorney fees”&lt;ref&gt;14&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Importance of Whistleblowing in the Public Sphere===
In a time of large governments and even larger corporations, it becomes difficult (if not impossible) to examine and analyze the motives and actions of all powerful individuals. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial that individuals within powerful entities have the ability to report on abuses of power without fear of retribution. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has consistently backed laws like the Whistleblower Protection Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, noting the importance of transparency in any society striving for democracy. According to ACLU Senior Counsel for Legislative Strategy Lisa Graves, “transparency is vital to American democracy, and whistle-blowers are those brave federal employees who bring hidden truths to light.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;ACLU Backs Bill To Protect Whistleblowers.&quot; UPI Security &amp; Terrorism (2006): Newspaper Source Plus. Web. 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
	However, there are obvious issues with the protection of whistleblowers in the current United States system. As demonstrated by the Scott Bloch controversy over the Michael Levine case, not even the government office responsible for overseeing whistleblowing claims is without corruption. In fact, Scott Bloch was repeatedly called to resign by various members of Congress after individuals working under him at the OSC became whistleblowers. A group of employees claimed Bloch acted in a hostile fashion toward them after they disagreed with his use of government power to promote an extreme religious agenda (which included Bloch’s removal of anti-sexual orientation discrimination mentions within OSC documents, as mentioned earlier)&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ELizabeth. &quot;Special Counsel Accused Of Intimidation in Probe.&quot; Washington Post, The n.d.: Newspaper Source Plus. Web. 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  If the body responsible for protecting whistleblowers actively silences would-be whistleblowers within its own ranks, how can it be trusted to handle complaints from other government entities?
	Reform is slow and necessary within the protection of whistleblowers. The Whistleblower Protection Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley were positive steps to decrease silencing abilities of powerful bodies. However, these actions are necessary but not sufficient. Reform is still needed within the OSC, though a step in the right direction was taken in 2008 when Scott J. Bloch left his post in the office. However, one of the most crucial reforms needed is widespread knowledge of employee rights. If employees (both of government agencies and of large corporations) are aware and confident of their rights under the Whistleblower Protection Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley act, they may be less fearful of upper-level intimidation or retaliation. Reform necessarily begins with education, and our nation stands only to gain greater transparency and accountability through better enforcement of these measures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Digital manipulation can be used to misquote individuals, repeat comments out of context, retouch photographs, even create false or misleading photographs and so is an ethical concern as well. While there are some beneficial, ethical, noncontroversial applications of digital manipulation, the matter of altering photos for publication purposes is the subject of debate. Some publications and photographers see no harm in altering photographs to remove an offending item., to make someone look a little more attractive, to illustrate a point, or to increase circulation. Although manipulation of photographs has occurred for quite some time in tabloids and other publications not known as being reputable new sources, there have been several incidents of more reputable news publications using digitally altered photographs in recent years.

* Only one postage meter is known to have been used in the Maldives. It was probably located at a window in the main post office.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Mali Federation=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The Mali Federation was a union between Senegal and the Sudanese Republic (formerly French Sudan). It was founded on 4 April 1959 as a French Colony and gained independence from France on 20 June 1960. After only two months of independence the Federation collapsed with the two members becoming the independent Republics of Mali and Senegal.
* The first meter was used in 1959. For issues before that date, see FRENCH WEST AFRICA. For issues after August 1960 see MALI and SENEGAL.
* All stamps are inscribed “FEDERATION DU MALI&quot;.

==Introduction==

In Part 1 we described the fundamentals of physics and engineering that apply to any complex project.  This includes Systems Engineering, which is concerned with managing the whole of a complex system across its entire life cycle, the design engineering tools and specialty areas of knowledge, and the organization and economics of projects.  Finally we looked at what projects and programs already exist, and the categories of future projects which might be pursued.  In Part 2 we began covering the particulars of space systems with the most characteristic element, the transport methods.   Since humans are starting from the Earth, then transportation is a prerequisite to doing any other tasks in space, and so we discussed that first.  Additionally, the very large number of possible transport methods justifies devoting a large section of the book to it.

In this Part 3 we will cover the particular design factors that apply to space systems, and the remaining subsystem elements besides transport methods.  Combinations of subsystem elements then form complete end items or products which execute designed functions and missions.  We will review these end functions and the methods available to perform them in a logical sequence by time, starting with exploration and ending with recycling.  The final major part of the book with then treat combinations of multiple end items and systems - how they grow, interact, and evolve.

==Overview==

:* '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Design_Factors|Design Factors]]'''

Design factors are those which influence the whole of a design, across different subsystems.  These include input requirements, technology level and availability of materials and suppliers, physical design such as margins and wear, and the limits imposed by humans as part of a system and the operating environment.

:* '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Subsystem_Design|Subsystem Design]]'''

There are numerous other systems besides propulsion required for most end items.  These include structures, mechanical, power, thermal, data, communications, sensors, and environmental protection.  When humans interact with an end item, you additionally need displays and controls, internal environment control, and crew support such as furniture, food, and clothing.  Items with an extended life require maintenance and repair in the form of tools and spares, and supplies such as fuel.

 
* '''Resource Exploration''' - This includes the methods of finding and characterizing resources located in space, as far as their location, composition, and other physical properties.  We only give a summary inventory of the known resources.  Full details comprise the entire fields of space science and astronomy, which are both large and ever growing.

* '''Resource Uses''' - There are as many possible end uses for the available resources in space as there are things to do on Earth. We list the major applications in terms of what we want to do first.  Later sections discuss how we can do them.

* '''Resource Extraction''' - Physical extraction is the task of removing materials from their native location, which is called '''Mining''', along with preliminary processing and transport for further processing and production.  Since you can only extract a physical material once from it's source, mining is typically mobile, where chemical processing and manufacturing tend to be fixed, since the equipment and connected power supply are often massive.  Energy extraction involves converting a primary source of energy into more useful forms such as electricity.

* '''Processing and Production''' - These tasks combine a multitude of simpler operations into one or more complete process flows.  The process flows convert extracted materials and energy into final bulk materials and finished components.

* '''Assembly and Construction''' - Assembly combines components to create a working device or machine. Construction first prepares a location, then assembles larger structures and outfits them with internal and external systems at fixed locations or orbits.  The distinction between assembling mobile machines and fixed construction is somewhat arbitrary in space, since even the largest orbital constructions can be moved.

* '''Operation and Maintenance''' - Once items are assembled or constructed, they must be operated according to their intended use, and normally will require periodic maintenance to keep functioning.  The overall concepts for operations and maintenance should be developed during design, so that necessary design features will be included.  If a part will need replacing, for example, a way to access it and remove it should be part of the design.

* '''Recycling Methods''' - Most engineered items eventually reach the end of their useful life.  Many methods and processes generate waste products, especially living things like humans. On Earth, disposal of scrap and waste has been left as a casual issue, and much of recycling, such as converting CO2 back to Oxygen, happens by natural processes. In space, recycling has to be more deliberate. In many locations there are not surplus resources that can be used, you are floating in a vacuum. You also cannot just dump wastes, as they would end up being a debris hazard. Thus efficient recycling will be both necessary, and less expensive than extracting and delivering new resources in many cases.  Thus recycling also needs to be planned for and designed in from the start.

While the topics arise more or less in this order, they need to be designed for in parallel, and will be performed in parallel, and in a connected network with transportation elements.  The following pages will discuss these topics in more detail.

==The Transport Challenge==

An ideal transport system has an infinite life and minimal operating cost when delivering a desired payload.  Real systems never reach that goal, and the designer's job is to approach it as closely as possible given the level of technology and other program limits.

====The Historical Problem====

The difficult job of the mid-to-late 20th century rocket designer was to find the best compromise between high cost and small payload when going to Earth orbit.  This compromise was forced by three factors conspired to produce a small payload fraction, and therefore high relative cost:
 
* The depth of the Earth's gravity well, which determines the velocity needed to reach orbit,
* The energy contained in chemical rocket propellants, which determines how much of them you need, and
* The strength and other properties of the materials used to build the rocket, which determines how much the hardware itself weighs.

It happens that the combination of these three factors conspire to produce a small, or even negative payload in an ideal one piece, long life rocket.  The total launch mass of such a rocket consists of 3 main parts: Propellant, Vehicle, and Payload.  Payload is what is left after accounting for the first two, and in 20th century designs that remainder could be negative, or at best a few percent.  For example, a single stage LO2/LH2 vehicle with a mission velocity of 9000 m/s and an exhaust velocity of 4500 m/s might be 86.5% fuel, 10-15% vehicle hardware depending on operating life, and thus -1.5 to +3.5% payload. The lower hardware weight was associated with more flimsy single use construction, and the higher weight with thicker long life design. The large ratio of rocket to payload weight led to high launch cost measured in $/kg. 

Various compromises had to be made from the ideal concept of a vehicle you could just refuel and launch again like an airplane.  One was to make the hardware last just a single flight, thus allowing lighter structures than ones built to last many flights.  Another is to drop parts of the vehicle during flight (staging). As fuel is used up less thrust is required to maintain acceleration, so fewer or smaller engines. Tanks also get emptied, so you can drop the excess engines and tanks once you don't need them any more. The remainder of the vehicle starts anew to accelerate towards orbit, but has the benefit of the velocity gained with the previous stage, and less vehicle weight. Low service life and staging are are expensive - you have to replace or re-assemble the hardware, but were necessary given the state of technology. The designer had to find the best balance between high cost due to small payload, or high cost due to discarding or rebuilding a complete rocket.

====The Modern Solution====

To reach a better result, the modern approach is to break one or more of the last century's limiting factors.  For example:

* You can build large structures that span part of the Earth's gravity well. This reduces the velocity the vehicle needs to reach. Even a small reduction shifts the near-zero payload into positive territory. Past systems have implicitly assumed chemical rockets to do the whole job of reaching orbit, because it was the only type of propulsion considered useful for that job.  There is no physical law that demands using one type of propulsion for the entire job, and using multiple methods often gets better total performance.

* There are now a multitude of alternatives to traditional chemical rockets.  This Part 2 of the book attempts to list all the known ones, of which there are 83 listed so far, not including variations.  Many of them have better performance, thus reducing the fuel required and increasing the net payload.

* Since the late 20th century materials with improved properties have emerged, which allows for longer service life or lighter weight.

Although having more options is more complex, the modern designer should consider the full range of available propulsion methods, and apply them where they function best.  The potential gain in going from short life, low payload transport to long life, high payload designs more than justifies the extra work. 

====Beyond Low Orbit====

'''Low Earth Orbit''', or LEO is the altitude range above significant atmosphere and below the Radiation Belts, or about 200 to 1,000 km altitude.  The above design challenge was to get from the ground into this orbit range.  Travel beyond LEO has not been as constrained to chemical rockets as initial launch.  That is because for vertical launch you need to be able to accelerate the whole vehicle at more than one gravity (9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in order to take off, and maintain a relatively high thrust to prevent hitting the ground again while still below orbital speed. One of the key features of chemical rockets is their very high thrust to mass ratio.  This made them attractive despite their low absolute efficiency. 

Once in a stable orbit, lower thrust levels can be used to travel further, since you are not in danger of immediate re-entry. Thus alternatives to chemical rockets have been examined for those missions, and some of them even put into use in past decades.  There are now more alternatives for going beyond LEO, which give better performance or wider design choices. The larger change, however, is in the first step of getting to LEO, which was entirely by one relatively low performance method until recently.


==Transport Method Tables==

As a starting point for designers, the following table lists the 83 main space transport methods known to the book's authors. They are detailed in the following pages and are organized into logical categories by type.  The order listed here and later in the book is by similarity of type, and not by feasibility or development status.  Those factors are considered later.  Many of these methods also have variations in the concept or application.  From this list, the designer can then narrow the choices to the relevant options for a particular project, and eventually the final selection.  By starting with all of them, you can be sure no viable option was missed.

[[File:Table_of_Space_Transport_Methods.PNG|771x927px]]

This second table shows the same transport methods only by their numbers, since including the names makes the table too large.  They are sorted in two dimensions by (1) the energy source and (2) the method that force is applied.  This is an aid to organizing and thinking about them.  Some of the theoretical methods are not shown on this table since we do not have definite designs for implementing them. Some of the methods indicated could span more than one box if all the possible variations are considered, but we have assigned them to single boxes in this version.  Empty boxes can stimulate thought about whether there are possible transport methods which are still unknown, or whether that particular combination truly lacks possible use.

These tables represent the state of knowledge in mid-2012.  There are likely some additional methods not yet known to the authors, and new ones will likely be devised in the future.  If a serious project is contemplated, designers should survey the relevant specialists and literature to include the latest concepts.

== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Oligopoly&amp;diff=2313885&amp;oldid=2313378]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* This should be &quot;background&quot; for the book--in fact, I'm not sure how often this course would get to oligopoly, but having a basic oligopoly section as background couldn't hurt.
* There is already some messy material on oligopoly in the background:
** [[Strategy for Information Markets/Background/Cournot competition|Cournot competition]]
** [[Strategy for Information Markets/Background/Bertrand competition|Bertrand competition]]
* So, the best thing to do would be to merge this page with those. Those pages are probably too long right now, as well as messy.
* ''Concentration Ratios''--That won't be necessary as part of this background.
* Not much to review, given that this should be merged. The writing here is good. The mathematical (and even better graphical) handling of the ideas would make it all better.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===

This template is a wrapper the usual &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;== Notes ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; combo used to insert footnotes. Its purpose is to allow the notes to be hidden from the [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf|wb2pdf]] PDF generator, which places the notes in the footers of PDF pages, making a separate &quot;Notes&quot; section pointless.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The study of economics is essentially the study of goods in markets. Goods come in many different forms and in order to study each one well, one must be able to differentiate and classify goods. One of the most common ways to distinguish the type of goods is showed in the table below. This table highlights two main concepts on which goods are classified: excludability and rivalry. The dictionary defines excluding as ''to shut or keep out''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster [[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rival|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore an excludable good is a good that one can prevent another from owning and using by owning it themselves. So if person A owns the excludable good, then person B can be prevented from owning it. If anyone could not be prevented from getting benefits from a good or service, then this good or service is called &quot;non-excludable.&quot; Now taking a look at the way rivalry impacts goods, the definition of &quot;rival&quot; is that ''one of two or more striving to reach or obtain something that only one can possess.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster&quot; /&gt; That means a &quot;rival good&quot; is a limited resource to be consumed. In other words, the amount of the good is finite, and therefore if person A were to acquire more of the good, it would mean that person B has less of the good.

If the good is both excludable and rival, it is a ''[[w:Private good|Private Good]]''. If the good is non-excludable but rival, it is a ''[[w:Common good (economics)|Common Good]]''. If the good is excludable but non-rival, it is a ''[[w:Club good|Club Good]]''. If the good is non-excludable and non-rival, it is a ''[[w:Public good|Public Good]]''.
[[File:Features of goods.jpg|600px|none]]

== Private good ==
'''[[w:Private good|Private Goods]]''' are excludable and rival. Comparing to the &quot;[[w:Public good|public goods]]&quot;, private goods usually require payments to be consumed, so they are less likely to have the problems of &quot;[[w:Free rider problem|free-rider]].&quot;

The classic examples of the private goods are the &quot;typical goods&quot; around us in daily life, such as food, clothes and flowers. There are usually limited amounts of these typical goods and as a result, the sellers and owners of these goods could prevent or exclude non-payers from having and enjoying the benefits of the goods. Because of their relative scarcity, most private goods are sold for profits.

== Common good ==
'''[[w:Common good|Common Goods]]''' are often called '''[[w:Common-pool resource|Common-pool Resource]]''' as well, since the typical examples of common goods are natural resources. These goods are non-excludable and rival.

Due to the features of common goods, they are easily over-consumed or abused. With no excludability, it is in the rational interest of individuals to consume and gather as much of the good for themselves as the rivalry factor means that their will be less for them if they do not consume it. This phenomenon spawned the term &quot;'''[[w:Tragedy of the commons|Tragedy of the Commons]]'''&quot;, which refers to the problem of depleting limited resources of common goods.

== Club good ==
'''[[w:Club good|Club Goods]]''' are also called &quot;Artificially Scarce Goods&quot; which are excludable but non-rival. This type of goods often requires certain &quot;membership&quot; in order to enjoy the benefits of goods. There are usually efficient ways to prevent non-payers to access the goods. One of the most classic examples of club goods is Cable TV, which requires a monthly fee but is non-rival after the payment.

== Public good ==
'''[[w:Public good|Public Goods]]''' (also as Collective Goods) are non-excludable and non-rival. Most of the information goods can be categorized as public goods. The other typical examples of public goods include the air we breath, public parks and street lights.

The biggest problem usually associated with public goods is the '''&quot;[[w:Free rider problem|Free Rider Problem]]&quot;'''. The characteristics of the public goods determine that they are easily to be consumed without payment. 

== Features of information goods ==
Most of the information goods naturally have the characteristics of public goods. In a summary, they have the features of non-rival goods, possibly excludable goods, discrete choices, experience goods and durable goods, etc. 

The laws to protect '''[[w:Intellectual property|Intellectual Property]] (IP)'''such as [[w:Copyright|copyrights]] and [[w:Patent|patents]] can make the information goods more excludable, by implementing penalties on the free riders.

      <comment>On GHCi</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Merge ==

I just merged this page with [[Haskell/Debugging/]]. There were significant amounts of copyediting; the only paragraph actually removed, however, was the one quoted below, which seemed a bit overzealous. I guess it might be reincorporated to the text in a milder tone, which does not confuse &quot;order specified in the program&quot; with the order of the source code tokens in the text editor:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It should be remembered, that &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; differs from debug print statements in imperative languages - &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; doesn't causes specified string to be printed immediately at point of program where &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; appears, but it attaches string to value passed as second argument so that string will be printed when that value will be evaluated by the program.
So trace statements may be printed in order that differs from the one specified in program.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By the way, it costs nothing to mention that the stub header &quot;Incremental development with GHCi&quot; might fit very well in [[Haskell/Using GHCi effectively]]...

      <text xml:space="preserve">== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Remixing&amp;diff=2312276&amp;oldid=2312274 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* Have an introduction which appears at the top--do this by not giving the first chunk of text any section header.
* Your signature should be reserved for the talk pages, not the main book text.
* ''&quot;software such as the program Maya, uses 3-d modeling to create new and different versions of an original copy. This program was actually used to create animation in films such as Spiderman and Lord of the Rings&quot;''--That sounds like original animation rather than remixing. You should come up with a better example.
* ''&quot;By using a program such as Web 2.0&quot;''--Web 2.0 isn't a program. (Or is it? If there is a piece of software called Web 2.0, that's a less common use of the term than [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 this one].)
* Don't make this a personal essay (most clearly this means don't refer to &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot;).
* This is interesting material about music remixing. Now it needs to become more relevant to the subject matter of this course. Here's some random thoughts:
*# Connect remixing to &quot;cumulative innovation&quot; in general
*# Does intellectual property law encourage or discourage this kind of art (or non-art remixing)?
*# What are the economic efficiency impacts, good or bad, of IP law encouraging or discouraging it?
*# How is remixing similar to or different from other forms of synthesis? (Like an engineer taking insights from separate scientists to create an invention.)
*# What about much older remixing?
*** This probably isn't a good '''reference''', but maybe partial inspiration: http://sydney.edu.au/arts/media_communications/salience/student_work/ferrari/remixhistory.html
*** Possibly: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Wood
* ''References''--You're too reliant on one reference source. Try to find stuff related to what you already have but in different sources, maybe with different perspectives.
** For instance, I bet there are other reputable sources talking about the legal issues around &quot;No Protection&quot;.
** You also risk crossing the line into plagiarism. If you paraphrase a small piece of one artical and then connect it to a paraphrase of a small piece of a different article, you're on safer ground than if you paraphrase a lot from a single article.
** In fact, based on [https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1AFAB_enUS448US448&amp;ix=acb&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=The+principle+of+the+Regenerative+Remix+is+to+subvert%2C+not+to+recognize+but+to+be+of+practical+use.+In+this+regard+Google+news+is+a+basic+Regenerative+Remix this search] you have crossed the line. Since you're referencing your source, I'm sure it's an honest mistake, but I'm going to pull out the last paragraph just in case. If you want to put it back, do it '''much more carefully'''.

I'm reviewing [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Glossary&amp;diff=2314435&amp;oldid=2314428 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* I made a formatting change to &quot;vaporware&quot;, you can see it [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets%2FGlossary&amp;diff=2314435&amp;oldid=2311083 here]. That did two things:
*# It put it into a more-formalized definition-list kind of format.
*# It added an &quot;anchor&quot;, which will allow other pages to link directly to that glossary entry. For instance, you can see that I changed the link to &quot;vaporware&quot; to go to the glossary instead of Wikipedia, [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Network_Externalities/Expectations_Management&amp;diff=2314727&amp;oldid=2312702 here's the change].
* Doing similar for the other entries would be good--do it here first before worrying about linking other things here, but once you've done all of the entries here, linking from the other pages (only within this book) would be worthwhile.
* Check your alphabetical order. It's mostly right, but there are some things out of place.
* Fleshing out the glossary entries, two things per entry would be good, getting as far as you can:
*# A link to the best place in the book to see more detailed discussion of that topic
*# A reference ''outside of the book'' to a good definition/discussion of the topic.
* The above should give you plenty to work on. I think having this glossary is good for the book. If you notice things in the book which are missing from the glossary, do add them. (I noticed &quot;monopoly&quot; is missing.)

The following is a list of notable easy to learn TV Theme songs to be played on the guitar which contains also links to external websites containing different informal chords to songs created by many different authors and represent their own interpretations to the original songs. Most of the chords on the list are relatively easy to learn, and would be a great start for novice guitar players whom are interested in improving their playing abilities.

The technical difficulty and skill level required to play each of the songs is defined with a star rating system:

*  [[Image:Star_full.svg|11px]][[Image:Star_empty.svg|11px]][[Image:Star_empty.svg|11px]] - Easy Songs
*  [[Image:Star_full.svg|11px]][[Image:Star_full.svg|11px]][[Image:Star_empty.svg|11px]] - Intermediate Songs

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

During the preliminary sections we introduced two important constructions on sets: the direct product and the disjoint union. In this section we will construct the analogous constructions for groups.

== Product Groups ==

'''Definition 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be groups. Then we can define a group structure on the direct product &lt;math&gt;G\times H&lt;/math&gt; of the ''sets'' &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;(g_1,h_1),(g_2,h_2)\in G\times H&lt;/math&gt;. Then we define the multiplication componentwise: &lt;math&gt;(g_1,h_1)(g_2,h_2)=(g_1g_2,h_1h_2)&lt;/math&gt;. This structure is called the ''direct product'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 2:''' The product group ''is'' a group, with identity &lt;math&gt;(e_G,e_H)&lt;/math&gt; and inverses &lt;math&gt;(g,h)^{-1}=(g^{-1},h^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;. The order of &lt;math&gt;G\times H&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;|G\times H|=|G||H|&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 3:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be groups. Then we have homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\pi_1\,:\, G\times H \rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2\,:\, G\times H \rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(g,h)=g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2(g,h)=h&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;(g,h)\in G\times H&lt;/math&gt;. These are called the ''projections'' on the first and second factor, respectively.

''Proof'': The projections are obviously homomorphisms since they are the identity on one factor and the trivial homomorphism on the other. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be groups. Then &lt;math&gt;\frac{G\times H}{H}\approx G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{G\times H}{G}\approx H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': This follows immediately from plying the first isomorphism theorem to Theorem 3 and using that &lt;math&gt;G\times\{e_H\}\approx G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{e_G\}\times H\approx H&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 5:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be groups. Then &lt;math&gt;G\times\{e_H\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{e_G\}\times H&lt;/math&gt; are normal subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G\times H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We prove the theorem for &lt;math&gt;G\times\{e_H\}&lt;/math&gt;. The case for &lt;math&gt;\{e_G\}\times H&lt;/math&gt; is similar. Let &lt;math&gt;g,g^\prime\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(g,h)(g^\prime,e_H)(g,h)^{-1}=(gg^\prime g^{-1},hh^{-1})=(gg^\prime g^{-1},e_H)\in G\times\{e_H\}&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


[[File:ProdGrp.png|thumb|Commutative diagram showing the universal property satisfied by the direct product.]]
We stated that this is an analogous construction to the direct product of sets. By that we mean that it satiesfies the same universal property as the direct product. Indeed, to be called a &quot;product&quot;, a construction should have to satisfy this universal property.


'''Theorem 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be groups. Then if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a group with homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\phi_1\,:\, K\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_2\,:\, K\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a unique homomorphism &lt;math&gt;u\,:\,K\rightarrow G\times H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi_1=\pi_1\circ u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_2=\pi_2\circ u&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': By the construction of the direct product, &lt;math&gt;u\,:\, K\rightarrow G\times H&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism if and only if &lt;math&gt;\pi_1\circ u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2\circ u&lt;/math&gt; are homomorphisms. Thus &lt;math&gt;u\,:\, K\rightarrow G\times H&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;u((g,h))=(\phi_1(g),\phi_2(h))&lt;/math&gt; is one homomorphism satisfying the theorem, proving existence. By the commutativity condition this is the only such homomorphism, proving uniqueness. {{Unicode|∎}}


=== Products of Cyclic Groups ===


'''Theorem 7:''' The order of an element &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\in\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;|(a,b)|=\mathrm{lcm}(|a|,|b|)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': The lowest positive number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(a,b)^c=(ac,bc)=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest number such that &lt;math&gt;ac=rm&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;bc=sn&lt;/math&gt; for integers &lt;math&gt;r,s&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; divides both &lt;math&gt;|a|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|b|&lt;/math&gt; and is the smallest such number. This is the definition of the least common divider. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 8:''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m\times \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are relatively prime.

''Proof'': We begin with the left implication. Assume &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n\approx \mathbb{Z}_{mn}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is cyclic, and so there must exist an element with order &lt;math&gt;mn&lt;/math&gt;. By Theorem 7 we there must then exist a generator &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\neq (0,0)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(|a|,|b|)=mn&lt;/math&gt;. Since each factor of the generator must generate its group, this implies &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(m,n)=mn&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;\gcd(m,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are relatively prime. Now assume that &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are relatively prime and that we have generators &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then  since &lt;math&gt;\gcd(m,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(m,n)=mn&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;|(a,b)|=mn&lt;/math&gt;. this implies that &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; generates &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;, which must then be isomorphic to a cyclic group of order &lt;math&gt;mn&lt;/math&gt;, im particular &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{mn}&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 9 (Characterization of finite abelian groups):''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be an abelian group. Then there exists prime numbers &lt;math&gt;p_1,...,p_n&lt;/math&gt; and positive integers &lt;math&gt;r_1,...,r_n&lt;/math&gt;, unique up to order, such that

:&lt;math&gt;G\approx \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}}\times ... \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_n^{r_n}}&lt;/math&gt;

''Proof'': A proof of this theorem is currenly beyond our reach. However, we will address it during the chapter on modules. {{Unicode|∎}}


=== Subdirect Products and Fibered Products ===


'''Definition 10:''' A ''subdirect product'' of two groups &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a proper subgroup &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G\times H&lt;/math&gt; such that the projection homomorphisms are surjective. That is, &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(K)=G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2(K)=H&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example 11:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. Then the diagonal &lt;math&gt;\Delta=\{(g,g)\mid g\in G\}\subseteq G\times G&lt;/math&gt; is a subdirect product of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with itself.


'''Definition 12:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be groups, and let the homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,:\, H\rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; be epimorphisms. The ''fiber product'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; ''over'' &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;G\times_Q H&lt;/math&gt;, is the subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G\times H&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;G\times_Q H=\{(g,h)\in G\times H\mid \phi(g)=\psi(h)\}&lt;/math&gt;.


In this subsection, we will prove the equivalence between subdirect products and fiber products. Specifically, every subdirect product is a fiber product and vice versa. For this we need ''Goursat's lemma''.


'''Theorem 13 (Goursat's lemma):''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups, and &lt;math&gt;H\subseteq G\times G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a subdirect product of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Now let &lt;math&gt;N=\ker \,\pi_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N^\prime=\ker\,\pi_1&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can be identified with a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;N^\prime&lt;/math&gt; with a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, and the image of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; when projecting on &lt;math&gt;G/N\times G^\prime /N^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is the graph of an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;G/N\approx G^\prime/N^\prime&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'':

=== Semidirect Products ===


=== Further Reading ===


More on the automorphism groups of finite abelian groups. Some results require theory of group actions and ring theory, which is developed in a later section.

http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0605185v1.pdf

== Free Groups ==

In order to properly define the free group, and thereafter the free product, we need some preliminary definitions.


'''Definition 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set. Then a ''word'' of elements in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a finite sequence &lt;math&gt;a_1a_2...a_n&lt;/math&gt; of elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, where the positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the ''word length''.


'''Definition 11:''' Let &lt;math&gt;x=a_1...a_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=a_{n+1}...a_{n+k}&lt;/math&gt; be two words of elements in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Define the ''concatenation'' of the two words as the word &lt;math&gt;xy=a_1...a_na_{n+1}...a_{n+k}&lt;/math&gt;.


Now, we want to make a group consisting of the words of a given set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and we want this group to be the most general group of this kind. However, if we are to use the concatenation operation, which is the only obvious operation on two words, we are immediately faced with a problem. Namely, deciding when two words are equal. According to the above, the length of a product is the sum of the lengths of the factors. In other words, the length cannot decrease. Thus, a word of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; multiplied with its inverse has length at least &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, while the identity word, which is the empty word, has length &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The solution is an algorithm to ''reduce'' words into ''irreducible'' ones. These terms are defined below.


'''Definition 12:''' Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be any set. Define the set &lt;math&gt;W(A)&lt;/math&gt; as the set of words of ''powers'' of elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. That is, if &lt;math&gt;a_1,...,a_n\in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_1,...,r_n\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a_1^{r_1}...a_n^{r_n}\in F(A)&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 13:''' Let &lt;math&gt;x=a_1^{r_1}...a_n^{r_n}\in W(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Then we define a ''reduction'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as follows. Scan the word from the left until the first pair of indices &lt;math&gt;j,j+1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a_j=a_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt; is encountered, if such a pair exists. Then replace &lt;math&gt;a_j^{r_j}a_{j+1}^{r_{j+1}}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a_j^{r_j+r_{j+1}}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the resulting word is &lt;math&gt;x_{(1)}=a_1^{r_1}...a_{j-1}^{r_{j-1}}a_j^{r_j+r_{j+1}}a_{j+2}^{r_{j+2}}...a_n^{r_n}&lt;/math&gt;. If no such pair exists, then &lt;math&gt;x=x_{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; and the word is called ''irreducible''.


It should be obvious if &lt;math&gt;x\in W(A)&lt;/math&gt; with length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x_{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; will be irreducible. The details of the proof is left to the reader.


'''Definition 14:''' Define the ''free group'' &lt;math&gt;F(A)&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as follows. For each word &lt;math&gt;x\in W(A)&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, let the  reduced word &lt;math&gt;x_{(n)}\in F(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;F(A)\subseteq W(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the subset of irreducible words. As for the binary operation on &lt;math&gt;F(A)&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x,y\in F(A)&lt;/math&gt; have lengths &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; respectively, define &lt;math&gt;x*y&lt;/math&gt; as the completely reduced concatenation &lt;math&gt;(xy)_{(n+m)}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 15:''' &lt;math&gt;F(A)&lt;/math&gt; ''is'' a group.

''Proof'':


'''Example 16:''' We will concider free groups on 1 and 2 letters. Let &lt;math&gt;A_1=\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_2=\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then

: &lt;math&gt;F(A_1)=\{a^n\mid n\in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a^na^m=a^{n+m}&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;F(A_2)=\{\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i}b_{i}\mid a_{i}\in F(\{a\}),b_{i}\in F(\{b\})\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a_i\neq e&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;i&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_i\neq e&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;i&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Example product: &lt;math&gt;(a^2b^{-3}a)(a^{-1}ba)=a^2b^{-3}aa^{-1}ba=a^2b^{-3}ba=a^2b^{-2}a&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Group Presentations ===

In this subsection we will breifly introduce another method used for defining groups. This is by prescribing a ''group presentation''.


'''Definition 17:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a subgroup. Then define the ''normal closure'' of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as the intersection of all normal subgroups in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; containing H. That is, if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal closure of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;N=\bigcap_{\stackrel{K\trianglelefteq G}{H\subseteq K}}K&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 18:''' Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;R\subseteq F(S)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be the normal closure of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F(S)&lt;/math&gt; and define the group &lt;math&gt;\langle S\mid R\rangle=F(S)/N&lt;/math&gt;. The elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are called ''generators'' and the elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are called ''relators''. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a group such that &lt;math&gt;G\approx \langle S\mid R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\langle S\mid R \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a ''presentation'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

== The Free Product ==

Using the previously defined notion of a group presentation, we can now define another type of group product.

'''Defintion :''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups with presentations &lt;math&gt;\langle S\mid R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle S^\prime \mid R^\prime\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Define the ''free product'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;G*G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, as the group with the presentation &lt;math&gt;\langle S\cup S^\prime \mid R\cup R^\prime\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark :''' Depending on the context, spesifically if we only deal with abelian groups, we may require the free product of abelian groups to be abelian. In that case, the free product equals the direct product. This is another example of abelian groups being better behaved than nonabelian groups.


'''Lemma :''' The free product includes the component groups as subgroups.


'''Remark :''' The free product is not a product in the sense discussed previously. It does not satifsy the universal property other products do. Instead, it satisfies the &quot;opposide&quot;, or ''dual'' property, obtained by reversing the direction of all the arrows in the commutative diagram. We usually call a construction satisfying this universal property a ''coproduct''.

== Problems ==

'''Problem 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be groups of relatively prime orders. Show that any subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H\times K&lt;/math&gt; is the product of a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; with a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.

Stateful computations are very common operations, but the way they are usually implemented in procedural or object-oriented languages cannot be replicated in Haskell. A &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; monad is introduced to allow states of any complexity to be represented.

== The Problem with Haskell and State ==
If you programmed in any language before, chances are you wrote some functions that &quot;kept state&quot;. In case you did not encounter the concept before, a ''state'' is one or more variables that are required to perform some computation, but are not among the arguments of the relevant function. In fact, object-oriented languages like C++ make extensive usage of state variables in objects in the form of member variables. Procedural languages like C use variables outside the current scope to keep track of  state.

In Haskell we can very often keep track of state by passing parameters or by pattern matching of various sorts, but in some cases it is appropriate to find a more general solution. We will consider the common example of generation of pseudo-random numbers in pure functions.

=== Pseudo-Random Numbers ===
[[:wikipedia:Random number generation|Generating actually random numbers]] is a very complicated subject; we will consider [[:wikipedia:Pseudorandom number generator|''pseudo''-random numbers]].
They are called &quot;pseudo&quot; because they are not really random, they only look like it. Starting from an initial state (commonly called the ''seed''), they produce a sequence of numbers that have the appearance of being random.

Every time a pseudo-random number is requested, a global state is updated: that's the part we have problems with in Haskell, since it is a side effect from the point of view of the function requesting the number.
Sequences of pseudo-random numbers can be replicated exactly if the initial seed and the algorithm is known.

=== Implementation in Haskell ===
Producing a pseudo-random number in most programming languages is very simple: there is usually a function, such as C or C++'s &lt;code&gt;rand()&lt;/code&gt;, that provides a pseudo-random value (or a random one, depending on the implementation). Haskell has a similar one in the &lt;code&gt;System.Random&lt;/code&gt; module:

 &gt; :module System.Random
 &gt; :type randomIO
 randomIO :: (Random a) =&gt; IO a
 &gt; randomIO
 -1557093684

Obviously, save eerie coincidences, the value you will obtain will be different. A disadvantage of &lt;code&gt;randomIO&lt;/code&gt; is that it requires us to utilise the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad, which breaks purity requirements.
Usage of the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad is dictated by the process of updating the global generator state, so that the next time we call &lt;code&gt;randomIO&lt;/code&gt; the value will be different.

=== Implementation with Functional Purity ===
In general, we do not want to use the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad if we can help it, because of the loss of guarantees on no side effects and functional purity.
Indeed, we can build a ''local'' generator (as opposed to the global generator, invisible to us, that &lt;code&gt;randomIO&lt;/code&gt; uses) using &lt;code&gt;mkStdGen&lt;/code&gt;, and use it as seed for the &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt; function, which in turn returns a tuple with the pseudo-random number that we want and the generator to use the next time:
 
 &gt; :module System.Random
 &gt; let generator = mkStdGen 0 -- &quot;0&quot; is our seed
 &gt; random generator :: (Int, StdGen)
 (2092838931,1601120196 1655838864)

And in this case, since we are using exactly the same generator, you will obtain the same value &lt;tt&gt;2092838931&lt;/tt&gt;, always the same no matter how many times you call &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt;.
We have now regained functional purity, but a function supposed to provide pseudo-random numbers that generates always the same value is not very helpful: what we need is a way to
automate the extraction of the second member of the tuple (i.e. the new generator) and feed it to a new call to &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt;; and that is where the &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; monad comes into the picture.

== Definition of the State Monad ==
:''Note: in some package systems used for GHC, the &lt;code&gt;Control.Monad.State&lt;/code&gt; module is in a separate package, usually indicated by MTL (Monad Transformer Library).''

The Haskell type &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; is defined as a function that consumes state, and produces a result and the state after the result has been extracted.
The definition is wrapped inside a &lt;code&gt;newtype&lt;/code&gt; to avoid pattern matching, so that no one can explicitly pattern-match and extract state unless we allow it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype State state result = State { runState :: state -&gt; (result, state) }
&lt;/source&gt;

The name &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; is actually a misnomer: it is not the state itself, but rather a ''state processor''.

=== Instantiating the Monad ===
Note also that &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; has ''two'' type parameters, one for the state and one for the result: all other main types of monads have only one (&lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, lists, &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;).
This means that, when we instantiate the monad, we are actually leaving the parameter for the state type:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Monad (State state_type)
&lt;/source&gt;
This means that the &quot;real&quot; monad will be &lt;code&gt;State String&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;State Int&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;State SomeLargeDataStructure&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; itself.

The &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; function is implemented as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
return :: result -&gt; State state result
return r = State ( \s -&gt; (r, s) )
&lt;/source&gt;
In words, giving a value to &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; produces a function, wrapped in the &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; constructor: this function takes a state value, and returns it unchanged as the second member of a tuple, together with the specified result value.

Binding is a bit intricate:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(&gt;&gt;=) :: State state result_a -&gt; (result_a -&gt; State state result_b) -&gt; State state result_b
processor &gt;&gt;= processorGenerator = State $ \state -&gt; 
                                   let (result, state') = runState processor state
                                   in runState (processorGenerator result) state'
&lt;/source&gt;

The idea is that, given a state processor and a function that can generate another processor given the result of the first one, these two processors are combined to obtain a function that takes the ''initial'' state, and returns the ''second'' result and state (i.e. after the second function has processed them).

=== Setting and Accessing the State ===
The monad instantiation allows us to manipulate various state processors, but you may at this point wonder where exactly the state comes from in the first place.
&lt;code&gt;State state_type&lt;/code&gt; is also an instance of the &lt;code&gt;MonadState&lt;/code&gt; class, which provides two additional functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
put newState = State $ \_ -&gt; ((), newState)
&lt;/source&gt;
This function will generate a state processor given a state. The processor's input will be disregarded, and the output will be a tuple carrying the state we provided. Since we do not care about the result (we are discarding the input, after all), the first element of the tuple will be null.

The specular operation is to read the state. This is accomplished by &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
get = State $ \state -&gt; (state, state)
&lt;/source&gt;
The resulting state processor is going to produce the input &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; in both positions of the output tuple, as a result and as a state, so that it may be bound to other processors.

=== Getting Values and State ===
From the definition of &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt;, we know that &lt;code&gt;runState&lt;/code&gt; is an accessor to apply to a &lt;code&gt;State a b&lt;/code&gt; value to get the state-processing function; this function, given an initial state, will return the extracted value and the new state.
Other similar, useful functions are &lt;code&gt;evalState&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;execState&lt;/code&gt;, which work in a very similar fashion.

Function &lt;code&gt;evalState&lt;/code&gt;, given a &lt;code&gt;State a b&lt;/code&gt; and an initial state, will return the extracted value only, whereas &lt;code&gt;execState&lt;/code&gt; will return only the new state; it is possibly easiest to remember them as defined as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
evalState stateMonad value = fst ( runState stateMonad value )
execState stateMonad value = snd ( runState stateMonad value )
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example: Rolling Dice ==
[[File:Dice.jpg|thumb|&lt;code&gt;randomRIO (1,6)&lt;/code&gt;]]
Suppose we are coding a game in which at some point we need an element of chance. In real-life games that is often obtained by means of dice, which we will now try to simulate with Haskell code. For starters, we will consider the result of throwing two dice: to do that, we resort to the function &lt;code&gt;randomR&lt;/code&gt;, which allows to specify an interval from which the pseudo-random values will be taken; in the case of a die, it is &lt;code&gt;randomR (1,6)&lt;/code&gt;.

In case we are willing to use the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad, the implementation is quite simple, using the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; version of &lt;code&gt;randomR&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Control.Monad
import System.Random

rollDiceIO :: IO (Int, Int)
rollDiceIO = liftM2 (,) (randomRIO (1,6)) (randomRIO (1,6))
&lt;/source&gt;
The two numbers will be returned as a tuple.

{{Exercises|1=
#Implement a function &lt;code&gt;rollNDiceIO :: Int -&gt; IO [Int]&lt;/code&gt; that, given an integer, returns a list with that number of pseudo-random integers between 1 and 6.}}

=== Getting Rid of the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; Monad ===
Suppose that for some reason we do not want to use the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad: we may want the function to stay pure, or we may want a sequence of numbers that is the same in every run, for repeatability.

To do that, we can produce a generator using the &lt;code&gt;mkStdGen&lt;/code&gt; function in the &lt;code&gt;System.Random&lt;/code&gt; library:

 &gt; mkStdGen 0
 1 1
The argument to &lt;code&gt;mkStdGen&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; that functions as a seed.
With that, we can generate a pseudo-random integer number in the interval between 1 and 6 with:

 &gt; randomR (1,6) (mkStdGen 0)
 (6,40014 40692)

We obtained a tuple with the result of the dice throw (6) and the new generator (40014 40692).
A simple implementation that produces a tuple of two pseudo-random integers is then:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
clumsyRollDice :: (Int, Int)
clumsyRollDice = (n, m)
        where
        (n, g) = randomR (1,6) (mkStdGen 0)
        (m, _) = randomR (1,6) g
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Stone Dice 17.JPG|thumb|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxcars_%28slang%29 Boxcars!]]]
When we run the function, we get:

 &gt; clumsyRollDice
 (6, 6)

The implementation of &lt;code&gt;clumsyRollDice&lt;/code&gt; works, but we have to manually write the passing of generator &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; from one &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clause to the other. This is pretty easy now, but will become increasingly cumbersome if we want to produce large sets of pseudo-random numbers. It is also error-prone: what if we pass one of the middle generators to the wrong line in the &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clause?

{{Exercises|1=
#Implement a function &lt;code&gt;rollDice :: StdGen -&gt; ((Int, Int), StdGen)&lt;/code&gt; that, given a generator, return a tuple with our random numbers as first element and the last generator as the second.}}

=== Introducing &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; ===
We will now try to solve the clumsiness of the previous approach introducing the &lt;code&gt;State StdGen&lt;/code&gt; monad. For convenience, we give it a name with a type synonym:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
type GeneratorState = State StdGen
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember, however, that the type of &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState Int&lt;/code&gt; is really &lt;code&gt;StdGen -&gt; (Int, StdGen)&lt;/code&gt;, so it is not really the generator state, but a processor of the generator state. The generator state itself is produced by the &lt;code&gt;mkStdGen&lt;/code&gt; function. Note that &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt; does not specify what type of values we are going to extract, only the type of the state.

We can now produce a function that, given a &lt;code&gt;StdGen&lt;/code&gt; generator, outputs a number between 1 and 6:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
rollDie :: GeneratorState Int
rollDie = do generator &lt;- get
             let (value, newGenerator) = randomR (1,6) generator
             put newGenerator
             return value
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation is in this case much more readable; let's go through each of the steps:
# First, we take out the pseudo-random generator with &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;: the &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; notation extracts the ''value'' from the &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt; monad, not the ''state''; since it is the state we want, we use &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;, that extracts the state and outputs it as the value (look again at the definition of &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; above, if you have doubts).
# Then, we use the &lt;code&gt;randomR&lt;/code&gt; function to produce an integer between 1 and 6 using the generator we took; we also store the new generator graciously returned by &lt;code&gt;randomR&lt;/code&gt;.
# We then set the state to be the &lt;code&gt;newGenerator&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; function, so that the next call will use a different pseudo-random generator;
# Finally, we inject the result into the &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt; monad using &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;.

We can finally use our monadic die:
 &gt; evalState rollDie (mkStdGen 0)
 6

At this point, a legitimate question is why we have involved monads and built such an intricate framework only to do exactly what &lt;code&gt;fst $ randomR (1,6)&lt;/code&gt; does. The answer is illustrated by the following function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
rollDice :: GeneratorState (Int, Int)
rollDice = liftM2 (,) rollDie rollDie
&lt;/source&gt;

We obtain a function producing ''two'' pseudo-random numbers in a tuple. Note that these are in general different:
 &gt; evalState rollDice (mkStdGen 666)
 (6,1)

That is because, under the hood, the monads are passing state to each other. This used to be very clunky using &lt;code&gt;randomR (1,6)&lt;/code&gt;, because we had to pass state manually; now, the monad is taking care of that for us. Assuming we know how to use the lifting functions, constructing intricate combinations of pseudo-random numbers (tuples, lists, whatever) has suddenly become much easier.

{{Exercises|1=
#Similarly to what was done for &lt;code&gt;rollNDiceIO&lt;/code&gt;, implement a function &lt;code&gt;rollNDice :: Int -&gt; GeneratorState [Int]&lt;/code&gt; that, given an integer, returns a list with that number of pseudo-random integers between 1 and 6.}}

== Producing Pseudo-Random Values of Different Types: the &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt; class ==
Until now, absorbed in the die example, we considered only &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; as the type of the produced pseudo-random number. However, already when we defined the &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt; monad, we noticed that it did not specify anything about the type of the returned value. In fact, there is one implicit assumption about it, and that is that we can produce values of such a type with a call to &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt;.

Values that can be produced by &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt; and similar function are of types that are instances of the &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt; class (capitalised). There are default implementations for &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt;, so you can immediately generate any of those.

Since we noticed already that the &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt; is &quot;agnostic&quot; in regard to the type of the pseudo-random value it produces, we can write down a similarly &quot;agnostic&quot; function, analogous to &lt;code&gt;rollDie&lt;/code&gt;, that provides a pseudo-random value of unspecified type (as long as it is an instance of &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt;):

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
getRandom :: Random a =&gt; GeneratorState a
getRandom = do generator &lt;- get
               let (value, newGenerator) = random generator
               put newGenerator
               return value
&lt;/source&gt;

Compared to &lt;code&gt;rollDie&lt;/code&gt;, this function does not specify the &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; type in its signature and uses &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;randomR&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise, it is just the same. What is notable is that &lt;code&gt;getRandom&lt;/code&gt; can be used for any instance of &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt;:

 &gt; evalState getRandom (mkStdGen 0) :: Bool
 True
 &gt; evalState getRandom (mkStdGen 0) :: Char
 '\64685'
 &gt; evalState getRandom (mkStdGen 0) :: Double
 0.9872770354820595
 &gt; evalState getRandom (mkStdGen 0) :: Integer
 2092838931

Indeed, it becomes quite easy to conjure all these at once:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
allTypes :: GeneratorState (Int, Float, Char, Integer, Double, Bool, Int)
allTypes = liftM (,,,,,,) getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
&lt;/source&gt;
Here we are forced to used the &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt; function, defined in &lt;code&gt;Control.Monad&lt;/code&gt;, since there exists no &lt;code&gt;liftM7&lt;/code&gt;. As you can see, its effect is to concatenate multiple monads into a lifting operation of the 7-element-tuple operator, &lt;code&gt;(,,,,,,)&lt;/code&gt;. To understand what &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt; does, look at its signature:
 &gt;:type ap
 ap :: (Monad m) =&gt; m (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
remember then that type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in Haskell can be a function as well as a value, and compare to:
 &gt;:type liftM (,,,,,,) getRandom
 liftM (,,,,,) getRandom :: (Random a1) =&gt;

The monad &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; is obviously &lt;code&gt;State StdGen&lt;/code&gt; (which we &quot;nicknamed&quot; &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt;), while &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt;'s first argument is function &lt;code&gt;b -&gt; c -&gt; d -&gt; e -&gt; f -&gt; (a1, b, c, d, e, f)&lt;/code&gt;. Applying &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt; over and over (in this case 6 times), we finally get to the point where &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is an actual value (in our case, a 7-element tuple), not another function.

So much for understanding the implementation. Function &lt;code&gt;allTypes&lt;/code&gt; provides pseudo-random values for all default instances of &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt;; an additional &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; is inserted at the end to prove that the generator is not the same, as the two &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;s will be different.

== The State monad ==

The State monad actually makes a lot more sense when viewed as a computation, rather than a container. Computations in State represents computations that ''depend on and modify some internal state''. For example, say you were writing a program to model the [[w:Three body problem#Three-body problem|three body problem]]. The internal state would be the positions, masses and velocities of all three bodies. Then a function, to, say, get the acceleration of a specific body would need to reference this state as part of its calculations.

The other important aspect of computations in State is that they can modify the internal state. Again, in the three-body problem, you could write a function that, given an acceleration for a specific body, updates its position.

The State monad is quite different from the Maybe and the list monads, in that it doesn't represent the ''result'' of a computation, but rather a certain property of the computation itself.

What we do is model computations that depend on some internal state as functions which take a state parameter. For example, if you had a function &lt;code&gt;f :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, and we want to modify it to make it depend on some internal state of type &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, then the function becomes &lt;code&gt;f :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; s -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;. To allow the function to change the internal state, the function returns a pair of (return value, new state). So our function becomes &lt;code&gt;f :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; s -&gt; (Bool, s)&lt;/code&gt;

It should be clear that this method is a bit cumbersome. However, the types aren't the worst of it: what would happen if we wanted to run two stateful computations, call them &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, one after another, passing the result of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;? The second would need to be passed the new state from running the first computation, so we end up 'threading the state':

 fThenG :: (s -&gt; (a, s)) -&gt; (a -&gt; s -&gt; (b, s)) -&gt; s -&gt; (b, s)
 fThenG f g s =
   let (v,  s' ) = f s    -- run f with our initial state s.
       (v', s&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) = g v s' -- run g with the new state s' and the result of f, v.
   in (v', s&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;)           -- return the latest state and the result of g

All this 'plumbing' can be nicely hidden by using the State monad. The type constructor &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; takes two type parameters: the type of its environment (internal state), and the type of its output. (Even though the new state comes ''last'' in the result pair, the state type must come ''first'' in the type parameters, since the 'real' monad is bound to some particular type of state but lets the result type vary.) So &lt;code&gt;State s a&lt;/code&gt; indicates a stateful computation which depends on, and can modify, some internal state of type &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, and has a result of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. How is it defined? Well, simply as a function that takes some state and returns a pair of (value, new state):

 newtype State s a = State (s -&gt; (a, s))

The above example of &lt;code&gt;fThenG&lt;/code&gt; is, in fact, the definition of &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for the State monad, which you probably remember from the first monads chapter.

=== The meaning of return ===
We mentioned earlier that &lt;code&gt;return x&lt;/code&gt; was the computation that 'did nothing' and just returned &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. This idea only really starts to take on any meaning in monads with side-effects, like State. That is, computations in State have the opportunity to change the outcome of later computations by modifying the internal state. It's a similar situation with IO (because, of course, IO is just a special case of State). 

&lt;code&gt;return x&lt;/code&gt; doesn't do this. A computation produced by &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; generally won't have any side-effects. The monad law &lt;tt&gt;return x &gt;&gt;= f == f x&lt;tt&gt; basically guarantees this, for most uses of the term 'side-effect'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shorthand is an abbreviated symbolic writing method that increases speed or brevity of writing as compared to a normal method of writing a language. Shorthand was used widely in the past, before the invention of recording and dictation machines. The advent of personal computers and laptop computers has dealt another blow to shorthand writing; it is not uncommon for students to take notes directly on their tablet PCs these days.

Surprisingly, though, shorthand hasn’t vanished altogether. A steady number of people still enjoy writing shorthand. With the “professionals” moving on to more high-tech means of note-taking, Shorthand is used more and more by “amateurs”: all kinds of people, often with a fancy for personal efficiency, use shorthand for incidental note-taking during classes, meetings, or any other situation. This shift from professional to amateur use is reflected by a shift in popularity, from systems that give the maximum number of words-per-minute (WPM), to systems with a more gentle learning curve that still yield fair performance with little training.

== Contemporary Shorthand Systems ==
Many systems of shorthand exist. A lot of information on various systems and their history can be found on the Internet, for example on [[wikipedia:Shorthand|wikipedia]], so we won’t go into much detail here. However, I feel that no book on shorthand is complete without mentioning at least the following systems:

;Pitman Shorthand: [[wikipedia:Pitman shorthand|Pitman Shorthand]] was first introduced in 1837 by [[wikipedia:Sir Isaac Pitman|Sir Isaac Pitman]], and has been improved many times since. It is mentioned here because it was, for a long time, the most commonly used shorthand system in the English speaking world, and it’s the basis of many modern shorthand systems. With its rich history, Pitman has a loyal group of practitioners, and much information about the system can be found on the Internet.
:Pitman uses the thickness of a stroke to indicate voicing (voiced consonants such as /b/ and /d/ are written with heavier lines than unvoiced ones such as /p/ and /t/). While line thickness can readily be varied when writing with a fountain pen or goose feather, modern writing tools, such as pencils, fineliners and ballpoints can only vary line thickness with more difficulty.
:Pitman Shorthand is a [[wikipedia:Phonetic|phonetic]] system; the symbols do not represent letters, but rather sounds, and words are, for the most part, written as they are spoken.
;Gregg Shorthand: [[wikipedia:Gregg shorthand|Gregg Shorthand]] was invented by [[wikipedia:John Robert Gregg|John Robert Gregg]] in 1888, and is the most popular form of pen stenography in the United States and its Spanish adaptation is fairly popular in Latin America. It’s partly phonetic, partly alphabetical. It has been revised countless times, with each revision being simpler and easier to learn than its predecessor, with the exception of the most recent revision in the year 2000.
;Teeline Shorthand: [[wikipedia:Teeline shorthand|Teeline Shorthand]] was developed in 1968 by [[wikipedia:James Hill|James Hill]], a teacher of Pitman Shorthand. It’s the most commonly used system within the Commonwealth, and is gaining popularity in the United States and Canada. It’s a purely alphabetical system. Teeline is a typical example of the modern trend towards systems that, while less efficient, are much easier to learn than the “classical” 19th century systems.

== Phonetic versus Alphabetic ==
{{RightHalf|'''Intermezzo: Spelling Reforms'''&lt;br /&gt;
In some languages there’s a very strict correspondence between spelling and pronunciation. Finnish, Turkish and Spanish are examples of languages with very close correspondence between written characters and pronounced phonemes. Even French, with its many silent letters and elision, has rules on pronunciation which allow pronunciation be inferred from spelling fairly accurately. Other languages, notably logographic languages such as Chinese, lack all correspondance between orthography and pronunciation.&lt;br /&gt;
After the invention of the printing press in the 1440s, most European languages have undergone one or more spelling reforms, often with the goal of making the spelling more consistent, more phonetic, and easier to learn. English spelling, by contrast, has been mostly fixed since the 1440s, i.e before most of the [[wikipedia:Great Vowel Shift|Great Vowel Shift]] which was never incorporated in English spelling. This has resulted in a spelling that is currently only about 40% phonetic.}}

If you’re just starting to learn Shorthand, and haven’t decided upon which system to learn yet, you probably can’t go wrong with either Gregg or Teeline. If you were to browse the Internet for a comparison of these two systems, you’d soon find out that the question “Which one’s better?” is subject of furious debate among the last shorthand evangelists, fueled by the fact that these two systems are so fundamentally different: Teeline is strictly alphabetic, while Gregg is (mostly) phonetic. Why is this such a big deal?

In contrast to what teachers may have told you, English spelling is neither logical or consistent. Just think about how the words ''straight'', ''streight'', ''strait'' and ''strate'' all sound the same, or how ''tough'', ''through'' and ''dough'' all sound completely different. It has been argued that when designing a new orthography (as many shorthand systems do), there’s no need to maintain a one-on-one correspondence between the new orthography and orthodox spelling with its classical 26-character Roman alphabet. In fact, the convoluted and often superfluous orthodox spelling is in direct conflict with shorthand’s goals of speed and economy of writing. In consequence, many shorthand systems are more or less phonetic.

Unfortunately, phonetic orthography comes with its own set of problems.&lt;br/&gt;
First, Modern English is pronounced in various ways; there are important differences between General American, British Received Pronunciation and Australian English. At least four major dialects are spoken in the United States alone. So if spelling were to follow pronunciation, the question arises: ''whose'' pronunciation? For personal note-taking, a sufficient answer would be: ''my'' pronunciation. But such a system rids itself of all claims to uniform spelling.&lt;br/&gt;
Second, Modern English dialects have over 40 different sounds (closer to 50 according to some linguists), which would require an alphabet of as many characters. QuickScript, with its 43 characters, is an example of such an alphabet. Writing phonetically feels awkward at first, and requires training. Having 40+ characters only adds to the learning curve.

System Groote is “mostly phonetic”: it's definitely more phonetic than alphabetic, but it cuts a few corners to overcome some of the problems inherent to a strictly phonetic approach.

== Target Audience ==
System Groote is originally a Dutch shorthand system, invented in 1899 by A.W. Groote. It was adapted by Groote himself to English, German and French, but in my opinion too “Dutch-centric”. Native speakers of the target language would be confused by many peculiarities in the system, that only make sense in a Dutch context.

Learning shorthand requires the investment of a time and energy. To people fluent with Dutch Groote, it’s a big investment to adopt a completely different system, such as Gregg or Teeline, to take notes in English efficiently. The primary target audience of this text are people who’d like to learn a single shorthand system to take notes in both Dutch and English efficiently.

I think, however, that system Groote is a worthy alternative to the Gregg and Teeline shorthand systems. With that in mind, this book is written for anyone who’d like to learn how to write English shorthand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==French pronunciation consistency?==
I wonder where this claim of French having consistent prononciation comes from. As far as I can tell, there are plenty of exceptions to any rules you might think of. 

e.g. What rule explains the difference in the first vowel sounds between mauvais (/mɔvɛ/), mauve (/mov/) and mauviette (/movjɛt/)? The pronunciation of &quot;os&quot; is also something of a one-off, being /ɔs/ or /o/ for the singular and plural forms respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most traits are not mendelian (due to the influence of a single gene), but are multifactorial

'''Multifactorial inheritance''' definition from genereviews.org: The combined contribution of one or more often unspecified genes and environmental factors, often unknown, in the causation of a particular trait or disease.

Many people use the term &quot;complex&quot; to refer to multifactorial inheritance. People also use the terms &quot;polygenic&quot; and &quot;multifactorial&quot; synonymously when really, they are not. Polygenic refers to a trait that is due to multiple genetic factors (many genes). Although it usually does, by definition &quot;polygenic&quot; traits may not have an environmental component. An example of this is eye color. Multifactorial traits, on the other hand, may be due to only one gene but always are influenced by environmental factors as well as (the) inherited factor(s). 

The definition of &quot;'''polygenic'''&quot; by genereview.org: A condition caused by the additive contributions of mutations in multiple genes at different loci. Loci are locations on a chromosome.

Multifactorial inheritance is an important and fundamental concept. Other variations from Mendelian inheritance are:

'''Codominance'''

When both alleles are equally represented and neither overpowers the other; two different alleles are both expressed in a heterozygote. The phenotypes mix in a way that both appear at the same time, intact, and are not blended. An example of this is the ABO blood antigens.

'''Codominance vs incomplete dominance:''' if mixing black fur with white fur makes pups with gray fur, it is incomplete dominance. If mixing black fur with white fur creates pups that have mottled black and white fur, it is codominance (like black and white cows). Complete dominance: One allele is expressed while the other isn't expressed at all. At the level of the body, Tay-Sachs disease is completely dominant. Heterozygotes (&quot;Tt&quot; genotype) have no symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease. The TSD gene codes for an enzyme. Heterozygous TSD carriers (&quot;Tt&quot; genotype) have half the normal level of enzyme activity. At the level of the enzyme activity, carriers of Tay-Sachs show incomplete dominance. Since this half level of enzyme activity has no effect on health, at the level of the body Tay-Sachs disease shows complete dominance.
Epistasis

One gene masks or otherwise effects the phenotype of another gene. Note, this involves 2 different genes, not 2 allele of the same gene. The expression of one gene is modified or blocked by the product of a different gene. An example of this is the Bombay Phenotype. Also, if a person has achondroplasia, then the mutant allele that causes dwarfism alters the height genes that would have been expressed. If a person has albinism, that alters the effects of the pigment genes that would have been expressed. The genome is a complex system and epistasis is not actually an exception but it is the rule. Many different genes are turned on and off by products of other genes to enable to cells to express the proteins we need to in a particular cell at a particular time. Epistasis leads to variability in phenotypes, even in a family where 2 people affected with a disease have the same mutation. Those 2 relatives may have the same disease - causing mutation but have or not have other alleles of different genes that exacerbate or reduce the effect of the mutant allele.
Genetic Heterogeneity

'''Genetic Heterogeneity''' is when different genes produce the same phenotype (not different alleles but different GENES). Individuals with identical phenotypes may reflect different genetic causes. In this case, a person who is genotype &quot;AAbb&quot; could have the same phenotype as a person who is genotype &quot;aaBB.&quot; Example: Hearing loss (deafness) There are 132 different forms of hearing loss. Many different genes, which code for different parts of hearing, can cause deafness.
Incomplete Dominance

'''Incomplete dominance''' occurs when one allele is not completely dominant over the other. The phenotype of heterozygotes (&quot;Aa&quot;) is intermediate between that of either homozygote (&quot;AA&quot; and &quot;aa&quot;). The heterozygote phenotype is a blend of the two homozygous phenotypes. Familial Hypercholestrolemia (FH) is an example of a disease with incomplete dominance. This is because individuals who have no mutant allele of the FH gene are unaffected, heterozygotes with one mutation are moderately affected, and people with 2 mutant alleles are severely affected. The heterozygote phenotype is a blending of the two homozygous phenotypes.
Genomic Imprinting

Some regions of DNA are expressed differently when they are inherited from the mother versus the father. These regions of DNA are &quot;imprinted.&quot; I think of it as &quot;programming.&quot; The genes are expressed one way if they arrived in the fetus from the egg and the exact same genes are expressed a different way if they arrived in the fetus from the sperm. Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is an example of a disease that can result from genomic imprinting.
Lethal allele combinations

'''Lethal allele combinations''' is when having the homozygous genotype is lethal. The ratio of affected to unaffected is skewed because one of the genotype possibilities does not survive.

    Parent's genotypes: Aa X Aa
        Offspring genotypes: AA, Aa, aA, and aa
    If the &quot;AA&quot; genotype is lethal then the offspring phenotype ratio is:
        2/3 phenotype of Aa or aA genotype
        1/3 recessive (&quot;aa&quot;) genotype
    If the &quot;aa&quot; genotype is lethal, then the offspring phenotype ratio is:
        1/3 dominant (&quot;AA&quot;) genotype, 2/3 phenotype of Aa or aA genotype

'''Mitochondrial Inheritance'''

The mitochondria is unique. It is an organelle that converts energy to a form the cell can use. The mitochondria has its own DNA! Most DNA is in the nucleus (in chromosomes). The mitochondrial DNA is in the mitochondria. People can have mutations in the DNA in their mitochondria. These mutations can interfere with the function of the mitochondria and cause diseases. &quot;Mitochondrial diseases&quot; are a category with many different diseases that are due to abnormalities of the mitochondria, many of which are due to mutations in mtDNA. mtDNA disease pedigrees: passed to ALL of the children of the affected mother and NONE of the children of the affected son. This is b/c the mitochondria in the zygote (fertilized egg) are all from the egg and none are from the sperm. In other words, mitochondrial Genes are maternally inherited. This is very useful for ancestry studies. Mitochondrial DNA has a higher mutation rate than nuclear DNA; the repair mechanisms the nuclear DNA uses are not present in the mitochondria. There are many mitochondria per cell, therefore you see heteroplasmy (some mitochondria in a cell have a mutation and others do not). An example of this is Leber's Optic Atrophy. A defect in the gene can produce other symptoms such as vision impairments, which can begin in early adulthood.
Multiple Alleles Specifying One Trait

Each person has 2 alleles for any autosomal gene: one is inherited from their mother and the other is inherited from their father. There are 2 alleles per gene per person, but there are many more alleles per gene in gene pool. Recall that the &quot;gene pool&quot; consists of the alleles for a gene in an entire population. For many genes, there are over 1000 different alleles in a gene pool. There are many different alleles that are just &quot;polymorphisms&quot; and do not affect the function of a protein. In other words, there is not just one &quot;normal&quot; allele but actually many varieties of &quot;normal&quot; alleles. Of the mutations that are not benign, not all are equally harmful. Some alleles cause mild changes in the protein, others cause moderate or severe changes in the protein, and some alleles make the protein completely non-functional or absent. The fact that there are many different allele combinations means that a person can have 2 mild mutations and have mild disease, and another person can have severe mutations in the same gene and have severe disease. Most diseases have multiple alleles.
Phenocopies

A &quot;'''phenocopy'''&quot; is when a phenotype mimics a genetic disease but actually has an environmental cause. A person who is deaf due to exposure to the rubella virus in utero is a phenocopy of genetic deafness. Another example: phocomelia (a limb deformity translation &quot;flipper-like limbs&quot;) due thalidomide exposure in utero looks like the genetic disease Roberts syndrome.
Phenocopies- environmental trait that appears to be inherited. Example is birth defect from the drug thalidomide. Infection:AIDS that was acquired from mother. Someone who has failure to thrive due to malnutrition may look a lot like a child who has cystic fibrosis and does not have access to medical care to treat digestive dysfunction.
Pleitropy

'''Pleitropy''' is when a single gene disorder effects more than one organ/organ system and leads to various different symptoms. (at times these symptoms seem to be distinct conditions rather than symptoms for a single disorder). This happens because a gene that controls several functions will have more than one effect. The product of that gene may play a role in many different organs. Example: Osteogenesis Imperfecta. People with OI have multiple fractures. The gene at fault codes for collagen, a major component of connect tissue. However, people with OI may also have a blue tint to the whites of their eyes and hearing loss. Many single gene disorders demonstrate pleiotropy, leading to a &quot;syndrome.&quot; The &quot;syndrome&quot; refers to many manifestations all stemming from the same underlying cause.
Reduced / Incomplete Penetrance

'''Penetrance and expressitivity''' describe degrees of expression of a single gene. Incomplete Penetrance: A gene that is not phenotypically represented by all family members who have the mutation in that gene. Penetrance is ALL OR NONE expression, not DEGREE. In incomplete penetrance, some people who have the genotype have NO expression of the expected phenotype. An example would be Polydactyly. Not all affected individuals with polydactyly genotype have extra digits. Another example is Von Hippel-Lindau Disease, a disease that greatly increases the chance of developing cancer. Not everyone with the mutation that causes VHL gets cancer. Those that don't show non-penetrance. Complete penetrance is less common that incomplete penetrance. Huntingtons disease shows complete penetrance. HD is an autosomal dominant adult-onset neurological disorder. If you die before you are 40 years it LOOKS like incomplete penetrance b/c you didn't live long enough to develop symptoms. BUT if you live to be 80 y of age and are genotype &quot;Hh,&quot; you WILL get the disease. It has complete penetrance.
Uniparental Disomy

When a child inherits two copies of the same gene from one parent and none from the other parent. Means &quot;two bodies from one parent&quot;. Prader Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome are examples of diseases that can result from UPD.
Variable Expressivity
'''
Variable Expressivity''' is when symptoms and severity vary between affected individuals. &quot;Expressivity&quot; refers to the severity or extent of symptoms. The expression of a mutant allele may vary due to multiple different mutations with different severities, and also doe to genetic background -- the influence of all the other genes that individual has influencing the phenotype--, and also environmental influences modifying the effects of the mutation. Example: Polydactyly (again). Some affected individuals may have one extra finger while others have multiple extra fingers and toes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Water''' ==
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{TOC right}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
=== Flood ===
A flood is a natural disaster caused by too much [[w:rain|rain]] or [[w:water|water]] in a location, and could be caused by many different sets of conditions. Floods can be caused by prolonged rainfall from a [[w:storm|storm]], including [[w:thunderstorm|thunderstorm]]s, rapid melting of large amounts of [[w:snow|snow]], or [[w:river|river]]s which swell from excess precipitation upstream and cause widespread damage to areas downstream, or less frequently the bursting of man-made dams. A [[w:river|river]] which floods particularly often is the [[w:Huang He|Huang He]] in [[w:China|China]], and a particularly damaging flood was the [[w:Great Flood of 1993|Great Flood of 1993]].

==== Flash flood ====

=== Drowning ===
[[w:Drowning|Drowning]] is caused by suffocation when a liquid causes interruption of the body's absorption of oxygen from the air leading to asphyxia. The primary cause of death is hypoxia and acidosis leading to cardiac arrest.

[[Image:Drowning child warning.jpg|thumb|200px|Children have drowned in buckets and toilets]]
Drowning is one of the major causes of death for children under 14 years old. Children have drowned in wading pools and even bath tubs. There is also a correlation of the rate of drowning in populations around the world and their access to water, the climate and the national swimming culture. For example, typically the United Kingdom suffers 450 drownings per annum or 1 per 150,000. Of population whereas the United States suffers 6,500 drownings or around 1 per 50,000 of population. 

So the risk or drowning seems related to the situation and awareness of the danger allied to the capacity correctly ascertain one's capacity to extrude oneself from the danger of drowning.

==== Prevention ====
The reduction of drowning through education has become a significant element of school curricula and is integrated into most water sports training. The elements incorporated into this training vary according to the particular context. 

Most current training emphasizes the need to: 
* Learn to [[w:swimming|swim]]
* Learn and practice water rescue.
* Know personal strengths and limitations in the water.
* Stay within one's depth unless a strong swimmer. 
* Keep a watch out for others.
* Swim with company, finding a buddy, children to swim with a responsible adult.
* Ensure that children have competent supervision in or near water.
* Swim in areas supervised by [[w:lifeguard|lifeguard]]s in preference to areas without. 
* Be cautious and very conservative when swimming at  night.
* Ensure that boats are reliable, properly loaded and that functional emergency equipment is onboard.
* Wear a properly fitting [[w:lifejacket|lifejacket]] while enjoying water sports such as [[w:sailing|sailing]], [[w:surfing|surfing]] or [[w:canoeing|canoeing]].
* Pay attention to the weather, tides and water conditions, especially currents. Currents always look weaker from the outside!
* Have a [[w:Pool fence|fence]] around swimming pools.
* Consider cold-acclimatisation training for swimming in very cold water, by joining a [[w:Ice swimming|winter swimming]] club.

Most current training emphasizes the need to avoid: 
* Swimming while drunk or on drugs.
* Using [[w:hyperventilation|hyperventilate]] to extend a breath-hold dive, see [[w:deep water blackout|deep]] and [[w:shallow water blackout|shallow water blackout]]
* Relying on swimming aids as they may fail.
* Playing games that will put your life, or others', at risk. 
* Pretending to be a drowning victim, unless '''ALL''' bystanders are informed that this is an exercise.
* Diving into water where the bottom cannot clearly be seen or depth determined.
* Walking on ice unless it is known absolutely that the ice is thick enough over the entire route.
* Handling electrical devices in or near the water.
* Exceeding personal limits.
* Swimming in cold water unless first, fully cold-acclimatised and experienced winter swimmer.

==== Drowning risk situations ====
[[Image:Hanakapiai Beach Warning Sign Only.jpg|thumb|200px|A sign with 83 [[w:tally mark|tally mark]]s warns hikers on the trail to [[w:Hanakapiai Beach|Hanakapiai Beach]], Hawaii.]]
Most drownings occur in water, freshwater (rivers and lakes, pools, etc) or in [[w:seawater|seawater]], drownings in other fluids are rare and are often industrial accidents.

Common conditions that may lead to drowning include but are not limited to:
* Water conditions exceed the swimmer's ability; - turbulent or fast water, water out of depth, falling through ice, [[w:rip current|rip current]]s, undertows, [[w:Current (water)|currents]], [[w:wave|wave]]s and [[w:Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]].
* Entrapment; - physically unable to get out of the situation because of a lack of an escape route, snagging or by being hampered by clothing or equipment.
* Impaired judgment and physical incapacitation arising from the use of drugs, principally alcohol.
* Incapacitation arising from the conditions; - cold ([[w:hypothermia|hypothermia]]), [[w:Shock (medical)|shock]], [[w:injury|injury]] or [[w:exhaustion|exhaustion]].
* Incapacitation arising from acute illness while swimming; - [[w:myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[w:seizure|seizure]] or [[w:stroke|stroke]].
* Forcible submersion by another person; - [[w:murder|murder]] or misguided children's play.
* Blackout underwater after rapid breathing to extend a breath-hold dive; - [[w:shallow water blackout|shallow water blackout]].
* Blackout on ascent from a deep breath-hold dive due to latent hypoxia; - [[w:deep water blackout|deep water blackout]].

People have drowned in as little as 30mm of water lying face down, in one case in a wheel rut. Children have drowned in baths, buckets and toilets; inebriates or those under the influence of drugs have died in puddles. For a more detailed list of causes see [[w:swimming|swimming]].

==== Rescue and treatment ====

Many pools and designated bathing areas either have lifeguards, a [[w:pool safety camera|pool safety camera]] system for local or remote monitoring, or computer aided drowning detection. However, bystanders play an important role in drowning detection and either intervention or the notification of authorities by phone or alarm. No person should attempt a rescue that is beyond his or her ability or level of training.

If a drowning occurs or a swimmer becomes missing, bystanders should immediately call for help. The [[w:lifeguard|lifeguard]] should be called if present. If not, [[w:emergency medical services|emergency medical services]] and [[w:paramedics|paramedics]] should be contacted as soon as possible. 

The first step in rescuing a drowning victim is to ensure your own safety. Then bring the victim's mouth and nose above the water surface. For further treatment it is advisable to remove the victim from the water. Conscious victims may [[w:panic|panic]] and thus hinder rescue efforts. Often, a victim will cling to the rescuer and try to pull himself out of the water, submerging the rescuer in the process. To avoid this, it is recommended that the rescuer approach the panicking victim with a [[w:buoyancy|buoyant]] object, or from behind, twisting the victim's arm on the back to restrict movement. If the victim pushes the rescuer under water, the rescuer should dive downwards to escape the victim.

Actively drowning victims do not usually call out for help simply because they lack the air to do so. It is necessary to breathe to yell. Human physiology does not allow the body to waste any air when starving for it. They rarely raise their hands out of the water. They use the surface of the water to push themselves up in an attempt to get their mouths out of the water. Lifting arms out of the water always pushes the head down. Head low in the water, occasionally bobbing up and down is another common sign of active drowning. 

There can be splashing involved during drowning, usually a butterfly like stroke where the hands barely clear the waters surface, and sometimes victims can look like they are climbing an invisible ladder in the water.

Extenuating factors such as increased levels of stress, secondary injuries, and environmental factors can increase the likelihood of distress and/or drowning in persons who end up overboard. It is important that you recognize the behaviors associated with aquatic distress and drowning, so you can make informed decisions during emergencies.

Signs or behaviors associated with drowning or near-drowning:
* Head low in the water, mouth at water level
* Head tilted back with mouth open
* Eyes glassy and empty, unable to focus
* Eyes closed
* Hair over forehead or eyes
* Hyperventilating or gasping
* Trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway
* Trying to roll over on the back to float
* Uncontrollable movement of arms and legs, rarely out of the water.

After successfully approaching the victim, negatively buoyant objects such as a weight belt are removed. The priority is then to transport the victim to the water's edge in preparation for removal from the water. The victim is turned on his or her back. A secure grip is used to tow panicking victims from behind, with both rescuer and victim laying on their back, and the rescuer swimming a [[w:breaststroke|breaststroke]] kick. A cooperative victim may be towed in a similar fashion held at the armpits, and the victim may assist with a breaststroke kick. An unconscious victim may be pulled in a similar fashion held at the chin and cheeks, ensuring that the mouth and nose is well above the water. 

There is also the option of pushing a cooperative victim lying on his or her back with the rescuer swimming on his or her belly and pushing the feet of the victim, or both victim and rescuer lying on the belly, with the victim hanging from the shoulders of the rescuers. This has the advantage that the rescuer can use both arms and legs to swim breaststroke, but if the victim pushes his or her head above the water, the rescuer may get pushed down. This method is often used to retrieve tired swimmers. If the victim wears [[w:lifejacket|lifejacket]], [[w:buoyancy compensator|buoyancy compensator]], or other flotation device that stabilizes his or her position with the face up, only one hand of the rescuer is needed to pull the victim, and the other hand may provide forward movement or may help in rescue breathing while swimming, using for example a snorkel. 

Special care has to be taken for victims with suspected spinal injuries, and a back board (spinal board) may be needed for the rescue. In water, [[w:cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] is ineffective, and the goal should be to bring the victim to a stable ground quickly and then to start CPR.

If the approach to a stable ground includes the edge of a pool without steps or the edge of a boat, special techniques have been developed for moving the victim over the obstacle. For pools, the rescuer stands outside, holds the victim by his or her hands, with the victim's back to the edge. The rescuer then dips the victim into the water quickly to achieve an upward speed of the body, aiding with the lifting of the body over the edge. Lifting a victim over the side of a boat may require more than one person. Special techniques are also used by the [[w:coast guard|coast guard]] and military for helicopter rescues.

After reaching dry ground, all victims should be referred to medical assistance, especially if unconscious or if even small amounts of water have entered the lungs. An unconscious victim may need [[w:artificial respiration|artificial respiration]] or CPR. 

The [[w:abdominal thrusts|Heimlich maneuver]] is not recommended; the technique may have relevance in situations where airways are obstructed by solids but not fluids. Performing the maneuver on drowning victims not only delays ventilation but may induce vomiting, which if [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=aspirated aspirated] will place the patient in a far worse situation. Moreover, the use of the Heimlich maneuver in any choking situation, involving solids or fluids, has become controversial and is generally no longer taught. For more information on this debate refer to the article [[w:Henry Heimlich|Henry Heimlich]].

100% oxygen is highly recommended, including intubation if necessary. Treatment for [[w:hypothermia|hypothermia]] may also be necessary. Water in the stomach need not be removed, except in the case of pediatric drownings as a gastric distension can limit movement of the lungs. Other injuries should also be treated (see '''[[w:first aid|first aid]]'''). Victims that are alert, awake, and intact have  nearly a 100% survival rate.

Drowning victims should be treated even if they have been submerged for a long time. The rule &quot;no patient should be pronounced dead until warm and dead&quot; applies. Children in particular have a good chance of survival in water up to 3 minutes, or 10 minutes in cold water (10 to 15 °C or 50 to 60 °F). Submersion in cold water can slow the [[w:metabolism|metabolism]] drastically. There are rare but documented cases of survivable submersion for extreme lengths of time. In one case a child named Michelle Funk survived drowning after being submerged in cold water for 70 minutes. In another, an 18 year old man survived 38 minutes under water. This is known as ''cold water drowning''.

[[Image:Network effect.png|right|thumb|Diagram showing the network effect in a few simple phone networks. The lines represent potential calls between phones.]]

In [[economics]] and [[business]], a '''network effect''' (also called '''network externality''' or '''demand-side economies of scale''') is the effect that one user of a [[good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] has on the [[value (economics)|value]] of that product to other people. When network effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on the number of others using it.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Overview==
The classic example is the [[telephone]]. The more people own telephones, the more valuable the telephone is to each owner. This creates a positive [[externality]] because a user may purchase a telephone without intending to create value for other users, but does so in any case. [[social network service|Online social network]]s work in the same way, with sites like [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[Google+]] being more useful the more users join.

The expression &quot;network effect&quot; is applied most commonly to positive network externalities as in the case of the telephone. Negative network externalities can also occur, where more users make a product less valuable, but are more commonly referred to as &quot;congestion&quot; (as in [[traffic congestion]] or [[network congestion]]).

Over time, positive network effects can create a [[bandwagon effect]] as the network becomes more valuable and more people join, in a [[positive feedback]] loop.

== Origins ==
Network effects were a central theme in the arguments of [[Theodore Vail]], the first post patent president of [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]], in gaining a monopoly on US telephone services. In 1908, when he presented the concept in Bell's annual report, there were over 4000 local and regional telephone exchanges, most of which were eventually merged into the Bell System.  The economics of network effects were presented in a paper by Bell employee N. Lytkins in 1917.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The economic theory of the network effect was advanced significantly between 1985 and 1995 by researchers Michael L. Katz, Carl Shapiro, Joseph Farrell and Garth Saloner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The economics of standards: theory, evidence, policy |author=Knut Blind |year=2004 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=978-1843767930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Network effects were popularized by [[Robert Metcalfe]], stated as the [[Metcalfe's law]]. Metcalfe was one of the co-inventors of [[Ethernet]] and a co-founder of the company [[3Com]]. In selling the product, Metcalfe argued that customers needed Ethernet cards to grow above a certain [[Critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]] if they were to reap the benefits of their network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0507/052.html |title=It's All In Your Head |publisher=Forbes |date=2007-05-07 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Metcalfe, the rationale behind the sale of networking cards was that (1) the cost of the network was directly proportional to the number of cards installed, but (2) the value of the network was proportional to the square of the number of users. This was expressed algebraically as having a cost of N, and a value of N². While the actual numbers behind this definition were never firm, the concept allowed customers to share access to expensive resources like disk drives and printers, send e-mail, and access the Internet.

[[Rod Beckstrom]] presented a mathematical model for describing networks that are in a state of positive network effect at BlackHat and Defcon in 2009 and also presented the &quot;inverse network effect&quot; with an economic model for defining it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/31/facebook-bill-gates-technology-security-defcon.html |title=How To Value Your Networks |publisher=Forbes |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |first=Taylor |last=Buley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Network effects become significant after a certain subscription percentage has been achieved, called critical mass. At the critical mass point, the value obtained from the good or service is greater than or equal to the price paid for the good or service. As the value of the good is determined by the user base, this implies that after a certain number of people have subscribed to the service or purchased the good, additional people will subscribe to the service or purchase the good due to the value exceeding the price.

A key business concern must then be how to attract users prior to reaching critical mass. One way is to rely on extrinsic motivation, such as a payment, a fee waiver, or a request for friends to sign up. A more natural strategy is to build a system that has enough value ''without'' network effects, at least to [[early adopters]]. Then, as the number of users increases, the system becomes even more valuable and is able to attract a wider user base.

Beyond critical mass, the increasing number of subscribers generally cannot continue indefinitely.  After a certain point, most networks become either congested or saturated, stopping future uptake.  Congestion occurs due to overuse.  The applicable analogy is that of a telephone network.  While the number of users is below the congestion point, each additional user adds additional value to every other customer.  However, at some point the addition of an extra user exceeds the capacity of the existing system.  After this point, each additional user decreases the value obtained by every other user.  In practical terms, each additional user increases the total system [[Load (computing)|load]], leading to [[busy signal]]s, the inability to get a [[dial tone]], and poor [[customer support]].  The next critical point is where the value obtained again equals the price paid.  The network will cease to grow at this point, and the system must be enlarged. The congestion point may be larger than the market size.  New [[Peer-to-peer]] technological models may always defy congestion.  Peer-to-peer systems, or &quot;P2P,&quot; are networks designed to distribute load among their user pool. This theoretically allows true P2P networks to scale indefinitely.  The P2P based telephony service [[Skype]] benefits greatly from this effect (though [[market saturation]] will still occur).

Network effects are commonly mistaken for [[economies of scale]], which result from business size rather than [[interoperability]].  To help clarify the distinction, people speak of [[demand side]] vs. [[supply side]] economies of scale.  Classical economies of scale are on the [[economic production|production]] side, while network effects arise on the demand side. Network effects are also mistaken for [[economies of scope]].

The network effect has a lot of similarities with the description of phenomenon in reinforcing positive feedback loops described in [[system dynamics]]. System dynamics could be used as a modelling method to describe phenomena such as [[word of mouth]] and [[Bass model]] of marketing.

== Technology lifecycle ==
{{see also|Technology lifecycle}}
If some existing technology or company whose benefits are largely based on network effects starts to lose market share against a challenger such as a [[disruptive technology]] or [[open standards]] based competition, the benefits of network effects will reduce for the incumbent, and increase for the challenger. In this model, a [[tipping point]] is eventually reached at which the network effects of the challenger dominate those of the former incumbent, and the incumbent is forced into an accelerating decline, whilst the challenger takes over the incumbent's former position.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

== Lock-in ==
Not surprisingly [[network economics]] became a hot topic after the diffusion of the [[Internet]] across [[academia]]. Most people know only of [[Metcalfe's law]] as part of network effects. Network effects are notorious for causing [[Vendor_lock-in|lock-in]] with the most-cited examples being [[Microsoft]] products and the [[QWERTY]] keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Strategy Analysis  |author=Robert M. Grant |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=0470747102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Network effects are a source of, but distinct from, lock-in. Lock-in can result from network effects, and network effects generate increasing returns that are associated with lock-in. However, the presence of a network effect does not guarantee that lock-in will result. For example, if the network standards are open, enabling competitive implementation by different vendors, there is no vendor lock-in. One example of this would be email, which has a considerable network effect but there is interoperability between different email providers.{{citation needed|source for example, which seems to confuse lock-in with vendor lock-in|date=February 2011}}

Lock-in can also result because users perceive that their [[switching costs]] do not cover the value of switching to the new service.  For example, relationships developed in one service do not transfer to the new service.  In other words, you are not willing to use a possibly better service because you have vested data in the service you are locked into.

==Types of network effects ==
There are many ways to classify networks effects. One popular segmentation views network effects as being of four kinds&lt;ref&gt;[http://oz.stern.nyu.edu/io/network.html Network Effects]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Two-sided network effects: An increase in usage by one set of users increases the value to and participation of a complementary and distinct set of users, and vice versa. An example is developers choosing to code for an operating system with many users, with users choosing to adopt an operating system with many developers. This is a special case of a [[two-sided market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Courses/StratTech09/Lectures/TwoSided/ParkerVanAlstyneMgmtSci2005.pdf |title=Two Sided Networks: A Theory of Information Product Design|author=Geoffrey Parker and Marshall Van Alstyne| journal=Management Science| year=2005| volume=51|number=10|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Direct network effects: An increase in usage leads to a direct increase in value for other users. For example, telephone systems, fax machines, and social networks all imply direct contact among users. In [[two-sided market|two-sided networks]], a direct network effect is called a '''same-side''' network effect. An example is online gamers who benefit from participation of other gamers as distinct from how they benefit from game developers.

*Indirect network effects: Increases in usage of one product or network spawn increases in the value of a complementary product or network, which can in turn increase the value of the original. Examples of complementary goods include [[software]] (such as an Office suite for operating systems) and DVDs (for DVD players). This is why Windows and Linux might compete not just for users, but for [[software developer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.si.umich.edu/tprc/papers/2005/487/Two-sided.pdf |title=Two-sided competition of proprietary vs. open source technology platforms and the implications for the software industry |author=Nicholas Economides and Evangelos Katsamakas |date=2008-05 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is more accurately called a '''cross-side''' network effect in order to distinguish network benefits that cross distinct markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://hbr.org/2006/10/strategies-for-two-sided-markets/ar/1 |title=Strategies for Two Sided Markets|author=Thomas Eisenmann and Geoffrey Parker and Marshall Van Alstyne|date=2006-10 | journal=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Local network effects: The structure of an underlying social network affects who benefits from whom. For example, a good displays local network effects when rather than being influenced by an increase in the size of a product's user base in general, each consumer is influenced directly by the decisions of only a typically small subset of other consumers, for instance those he or she is &quot;connected&quot; to via an underlying social or business network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sundararajan, Arun| title=Local network effects and complex network structure | journal=The B.E. Journal of Theoretical Economics| year=2007| volume=7| doi=10.2202/1935-1704.1319 | url=http://www.bepress.com/bejte/vol7/iss1/art46  | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instant messaging is an example of a product that displays local network effects.

Additionally, there are two sources of [[economic value]] that are relevant when analyzing products that display network effects:
*Inherent value: I derive value from my use of the product
*Network value: I derive value from other people's use of the product

==Negative network effects==
There are negative network effects beyond lock-in.

*Congestion occurs when the efficiency of a network decreases as more people use it, and this reduces the value to people already using it. [[Traffic congestion]] that overloads the freeway and [[network congestion]] over limited bandwidth both display negative network externalities.

==Interoperability==
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

==Open versus closed standards==
In communication and information technologies, open standards and interfaces are often developed through the participation of multiple companies and are usually perceived to provide mutual benefit.  But, in cases in which the relevant communication protocols or interfaces are closed standards the network effect can give the company controlling those standards monopoly power. The [[Microsoft]] corporation is widely seen by computer professionals as maintaining its monopoly through these means. One observed method Microsoft uses to put the network effect to its advantage is called [[Embrace, extend and extinguish]].

[[Mirabilis (company)|Mirabilis]] is an [[Israel]]i start-up which pioneered [[instant messaging]] (IM) and was bought by [[AOL|America Online]]. By giving away their [[ICQ]] product [[Free as in beer|for free]] and preventing [[interoperability]] between their client [[software]] and other products, they were able to temporarily dominate the market for instant messaging. Because of the network effect, new IM users gained much more value by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and join its large network of users) than they would using a competing system. As was typical for that era, the company never made any attempt to generate profits from their dominant position before selling the company.

== Examples==
{{Missing information non-contentious|credit cards|date=February 2011}}

===Financial exchanges===
[[Stock exchange]]s and [[derivatives exchanges]] feature a network effect.  [[Market liquidity]] is a major determinant of transaction cost in the sale or purchase of a security, as a [[bid-ask spread]] exists between the price at which a purchase can be done versus the price at which the sale of the same security can be done.  As the number of buyers and sellers on an exchange increases, liquidity increases, and transaction costs decrease.  This then attracts a larger number of buyers and sellers to the exchange. See, for example, the work of Steve Wunsch (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Wunsch, Steve (1999). &quot;[http://www.stevewunsch.com/maydaymayday.htm Mayday, Mayday]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The network advantage of financial exchanges is apparent in the difficulty that startup exchanges have in dislodging a dominant exchange.  For example, the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] has retained overwhelming dominance of trading in US [[Treasury Bond]] futures despite the startup of [[Eurex]] US trading of identical futures contracts.  Similarly, the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] has maintained a dominance in trading of Eurobond interest rate futures despite a challenge from [[Euronext.Liffe]].

===Software===
There are very strong network effects operating in the market for widely used computer software.

Take, for example, [[Microsoft Office]].  For many people choosing an [[office suite]], prime considerations include how valuable having learned that office suite will prove to potential [[employer]]s, and how well the software interoperates with other users.  That is, since learning to use an office suite takes many hours, they want to invest that time learning the office suite that will make them most attractive to potential employers (or consulting [[consumer|client]]s, etc.), and they also want to be able to share documents. (Additionally, an example of an indirect network effect in this case is the notable similarity in [[user-interface]]s and operability menus of most new software - since that similarity directly translates into less time spent learning new environments, therefore potentially greater acceptance and adoption of those products.)

Similarly, finding already-trained [[employee]]s is a big concern for employers when deciding which office suite to purchase or standardize on.  The lack of [[cross-platform]] [[user-interface]] standards results in a situation in which one firm is in control of almost 100% of the market.

[[Microsoft Windows]] is a further example of network effect.  The most-vaunted advantage of Windows, and that most publicised by Microsoft, is that Windows is compatible with the widest range of [[computer hardware]] and software.  Although this claim is justified, it is in reality the result of network effect: hardware and software manufacturers ensure that their products are compatible with Windows in order to have access to the large market of Windows users.  Thus, Windows is popular because it is well supported, but is well supported because it is popular.

However, network effects need not lead to market dominance by one firm, when there are standards which allow multiple firms to interoperate, thus allowing the network externalities to benefit the entire market.  This is true for the case of [[x86]]-based [[personal computer]] hardware, in which there are extremely strong market pressures to interoperate with pre-existing standards, but in which no one firm dominates in the market.  Also, it is true for the development of enterprise software applications where the Internet (HTTP), databases (SQL), and to a moderate degree, service-oriented message buses (SOA) have become common interfaces.  Further up the development chain there are network effects as well in language back-end base platforms (JVM, CLR, LLVM), programming models (FP, OOP) and languages themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welton.it/articles/programming_language_economics?repost The Economics of Programming Languages], David N. Welton : 2005-07-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telecommunications===
The same holds true for the market for [[long-distance telephone service]] within the [[United States]].  In fact, the existence of these types of networks discourages dominance of the market by one company, as it creates pressures which work against one company attempting to establish a proprietary protocol or to even distinguish itself by means of product differentiation.

===Web sites===
Many [[web site]]s also feature a network effect. One example is web marketplaces and exchanges, in that the value of the marketplace to a new user is proportional to the number of other users in the market.  For example, [[eBay]] would not be a particularly useful site if [[auction]]s were not competitive. However, as the number of users grows on eBay, auctions grow more competitive, pushing up the prices of bids on items. This makes it more worthwhile to sell on eBay and brings more sellers onto eBay, which drives prices down again as this increases supply, while bringing more people onto eBay because there are more things being sold that people want. Essentially, as the number of users of eBay grows, prices fall and supply increases, and more and more people find the site to be useful.

The collaborative encyclopedia [[Wikipedia]] also benefits from a network effect. The theory goes that as the number of editors grows, the quality of information on the website improves, encouraging more users to turn to it as a source of information; some of the new users in turn become editors, continuing the process.

[[Social networking]] websites are also good examples. The more people register onto a social networking website, the more useful the website is to its registrants.

By contrast, the value of a news site is primarily proportional to the quality of the articles, not to the number of other people using the site.  Similarly, the first generation of search sites experienced little network effect, as the value of the site was based on the value of the search results.  This allowed [[Google]] to win users away from [[Yahoo!]] without much trouble, once users believed that Google's search results were superior.  Some commentators mistook the value of the Yahoo! brand (which does increase as more people know of it) for a network effect protecting its advertising business.

[[Alexa Internet]] uses a technology that tracks users' surfing patterns; thus Alexa's Related Sites results improve as more users use the technology. Alexa's network relies heavily on a small number of browser software relationships, which makes the network more vulnerable to competition.

Google has also attempted to create a network effect in its advertising business with its Google AdSense service.  [[Google AdSense]] places ads on many small sites, such as [[blog]]s, using Google technology to determine which ads are relevant to which blogs.  Thus, the service appears to aim to serve as an exchange (or ad network) for matching many advertisers with many small sites (such as blogs).  In general, the more blogs Google AdSense can reach, the more advertisers it will attract, making it the most attractive option for more blogs, and so on, making the network more valuable for all participants.

Network effects were used as justification for some of the [[dot-com company|dot-com]] [[business model]]s in the late 1990s. These firms operated under the belief that when a new [[market]] comes into being which contains strong network effects, firms should care more about growing their [[market share]] than about becoming [[Profit (accounting)|profitable]].  This was believed because market share will determine which firm can set technical and marketing standards and thus determine the basis of future [[competition]].

=== Rail gauge ===
[[Image:Rail gauge world.png|thumb|350px|The dominant rail gauge in each country shown]]
There are strong network effects in the initial choice of [[rail gauge]], and in [[gauge conversion]] decisions.
Even when placing isolated rails not connected to any other lines, track layers usually choose a standard rail gauge so they can use off-the-shelf rolling stock.
Although a few manufacturers make rolling stock that can adjust to different rail gauges, most manufacturers make rolling stock that only works with one of the standard rail gauges.

If the date of birth edit does not seem to save (issue seen in 3.1.3.1 and 3.1.4), try the following workaround from this [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2013-August/008649.html OpenClinica Users mailing list thread]:

{{Quote|text=There actually is a workaround: setting the PersonID as optional in your StudyParameters. Strange thing is that you do not have to fill it in: there will be just a box and even if you leave it empty, you can modify the DoB and then go to the next screen with a Submit-button and all.

Some guidelines:
* if you want to collect DoB on Subject-level, set PersonID to optional
* if you want to use web-services, set gender to required
* if you want to do any validations on DoB or gender, or if yu want to use them in validations of other items, collect them in a CRF}}

Once the date of birth edit is made, the PersonID StudyParameter can be re-set to Not Used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intelligence dissemination (alpha = 0.75) ==
=== Description ===

In order to improve operationalization and psychometric properties, a market orientation scale (MARKOR) taken from Kohli et al. (1993) is modified. The resulting market orientation scale (MO) has three dimensions: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Intelligence generation|intelligence generation]], intelligence dissemination, and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Responsiveness|responsiveness]].

=== Items ===

*Marketing personnel in our business unit spend time discussing customers' future needs with other functional departments.
*Our business unit periodically circulates documents (e.g., reports, newsletters) that provide information on our customers.
*We have cross-functional meetings very often to discuss market trends and developments (e.g., customers, competition, suppliers).
*We regularly have interdepartmental meetings to update our knowledge of regulatory requirements.
*Technical people in the business unit spend a lot of time sharing information about technology for new products with other departments.
*Market information spreads quickly through all levels in this business unit.

=== Items ===

*We poll end users at least once a year to assess the quality of our products and services.
*In our business unit, intelligence on our competitors is generated independently by several departments.
*We periodically review the likely effect of changes in our business environment (e.g., regulation) on customers.
*In this business unit, we frequently collect and evaluate general macro-economic information (e.g., interest rate, exchange rate, GDP, industry growth rate, inflation rate).
*In this business unit, we maintain contacts with ifficials of government and regulatory bodies (e.g., Department of Agriculture, FDA, FTC, Congress) in order to collect and evaluate pertinent information.
*In this business unit, we collect and evaluate information concerning general social trends (e.g., environmental consciousness, emerging lifestyles) that might affect our business.
*In the business unit, we spend time with our suppliers to learn more about various aspects of their business (e.g., manufacturing process, industry practices, clientele).
*In our business unit, only a few people are collecting competitor information. (reverse coded)

=== Description ===

In order to improve operationalization and psychometric properties, a market orientation scale (MARKOR) taken from Kohli et al. (1993) is modified. The resulting market orientation scale (MO) has three dimensions: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Intelligence generation|intelligence generation]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Intelligence dissemination|intelligence dissemination]], and responsiveness.

=== Items ===

*For one reason or another, we tend to ignore changes in our customers' product or service needs. (reverse-coded)
*The product lines we sell depend more on internal politics than real market needs. (reverse-coded)
*We are slow to start business with new suppliers even though we think they are better than existing ones. (reverse-coded)
*If a major competitor were to launch an intensive campaign targeted at our customers, we would implement a response immediately.
*The activities of the different departments in this business unit are well coordinated.
*Even if we came up with a great marketing plan, we probably would not be able to implement it in a timely fashion. (reverse-coded)
*If a special interest group (e.g., consumer group, environmental group) were to publicly accuse us of harmful business practices, we would respond to the criticism immediately.
*We tend to take longer than our competitors to respond to a change in regulatory policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Vowel “a” and half-height consonants =
The title of this chapter mentions ''half-height consonants''. “Half of what height?”, the intelligent reader might wonder.

Well, shorthand is normally written on lined paper. For example, the text “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name” would be written like this: [[Image:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}-Lords Prayer.svg|none]]

Each writing line is divided into four imaginary “quarter-height” parts: [[Image:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}-Lords Prayer w Lines.svg|none]]

All symbols introduced in this chapter are half a line-height tall. And here they are: [[Image:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}-Half Height Symbols.svg|none]]

The first two symbols are written upward, and roughly correspond to character “a”. The first symbol is used for two different sounds:
* '''/ɑː/''' as in '''p&lt;u&gt;al&lt;/u&gt;m, f&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;ther, st&lt;u&gt;ar&lt;/u&gt;.'''
* '''/æ/''' as in '''tr&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;p, b&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;d, c&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;t.'''

All the other symbols are written downward. The first

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Does your major determine your career?==
There are some professions where what you major in really does make a difference, like accounting, engineering, and education. But many careers are not tied directly to a major.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollak2011&quot;&gt;http://www.lindseypollak.com/archives/why-your-college-major-doesn%E2%80%99t-matter&lt;/ref&gt; Employers will be more interested if you have experience in the field. While majoring in that area is helpful, that experience can also come from part-time jobs, extracurricular activities, internships, or volunteering. Employers primarily want to see that a prospective employee knows what he/she is doing. They are also interested in how skilled one is at a certain task or set of tasks. For example, if you want to become a computer programmer but majored in English, it is possible to illustrate to a potential employer that you know how to program by writing some software, passing certifications, and taking various programming tests. Passion, grades, and connections aren't as important as majoring in a specific area, but they are all important.  Your major does not have to determine your career.

A conviction or finding of guilt is not entered until such time as the court accepts the plea. A plea by itself is not enough.&lt;reF&gt;
R v Senior [http://canlii.ca/t/2ddb8 1996 ABCA 71], 1996 116 CCC 3d 152 (ABCA)&lt;br&gt; 
R v Shrupka [http://canlii.ca/t/1fl9s 2000 MBCA 112], 2000 149 CCC 3d 410 (MBCA) at 24&lt;/ref&gt;

A plea of guilty can only be accepted by the Court if the requirements of s. 606(1.1) are satisfied. The provision states: 
{{quotation|
:606(1.1) A court may accept a plea of guilty only if it is satisfied that the accused
::(a) is making the plea voluntarily; and
::(b) understands
:::(i)that the plea is an admission of the essential elements of the offence,
:::(ii)the nature and consequences of the plea, and
:::(iii)that the court is not bound by any agreement made between the accused and the prosecutor.|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec606]
}}

A plea must be taken in the presence of an accused “unless the court orders otherwise”.&lt;ref&gt;see s.650.01(3)(c)&lt;/ref&gt; This would potentially include acceptance of pleas through the use of video links.&lt;ref&gt;see 606(1.2); 650(1.1); 650(1.2)&lt;/ref&gt;

For a guilty plea to be valid it must possess the following attributes:&lt;REf&gt;

R. v. Pottie, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mpvm 1996 CanLII 5604], (1996) NSR 2d 56 (NSCA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* voluntary, 
* unequivocal, 
* informed of the nature of the allegations, 
* informed of the consequences of a plea


{{reflist|2}}

==Inquiry into guilty plea==
The judge has discretion to inquire into whether the accused meets these criteria. &lt;ref&gt;
See  Brosseau v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 181, [1969] 3 C.C.C. 129 [http://canlii.ca/t/1xcgb]&lt;br&gt; 
Thibodeau v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 646;[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1955/1955canlii57/1955canlii57.html] &lt;br&gt;
Adgey v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426, 13 C.C.C. (2d) 177 [http://canlii.ca/t/1twzm]&lt;br&gt;
See:  R. v. Lamoureux, (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 101 (Que. C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Antoine (1984) 40 C.R. (3d) 375 (Que. C.A.)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge need not “fully inquire” into whether 606(1.1) is met before accepting a guilty plea.&lt;Ref&gt; 
see 606(1.2)&lt;br&gt; Eizenga [http://canlii.ca/t/2fmpr#par47 2011 ONCA 113 at 47]&lt;Br&gt; 
Messervey [http://canlii.ca/t/2b612 2010 NSCA 55]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Walsh [http://canlii.ca/t/1mssx 2006 CanLII 7393] (ON CA), (2006), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 543 at 28&lt;br&gt;
R. v. G.T.(J.), [http://canlii.ca/t/5fhs#par19 2003 BCCA 1 at 19]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the plea is entered in open court it is presumed valid.

When entered with counsel it is presumed that the accused was &quot;fully familiar with the circumstances surrounding the offence and to have been aware of the consequences of entering a guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Paiero, (1986), 71 N.S.R. (2d) 268 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
The presumption is stronger where it is done after consulting with experienced counsel.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Swanson [http://canlii.ca/t/53zp#par24 2000 BCCA 177 at 24]&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Procedural Effect of a Guilty Plea==
Once a plea has been made it is considered formal proof of the offence committed. There is no burden on the Crown to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. C.(W.B.) 2000, 142 CCC 3d 490 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a plea is not formal proof of the underlying facts. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Berry (1957) 118 CCC 55 (Ont.CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

A guilty plea is considered the end of the challenge to the criminal charge against the accused.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bowman, [http://canlii.ca/t/21863 2008 BCCA 410]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Duong, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nq1g 2006 BCCA 325]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This also means that the guilty plea will extinguish any procedural rights, rights of appeal or ability to challenge the ruling of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;
Korponay v Canada (Attorney General), [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpbj 1982 CanLII 12] (SCC), [1982] 1 SCR 41 at p. 49&lt;Br&gt;
Brady v US, 397 US 742 (1970) at p. 748&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
There can only be a re-opening of the issue of admissibility of the evidence if the accused was not aware of the effect of the guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Duong, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nq1g 2006 BCCA 325]
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Where a Charter application fails and there remains no further defence, the proper procedure to preserve the right of appeal is to admit the facts allegecd and invite the judge to convict.&lt;ref&gt;See 
R v Duong [http://canlii.ca/t/1nq1g#par8 2006 BCCA 325 at para.8]&lt;br&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Validity and Withdraw of Guilty Plea==
A guilty plea can be withdrawn any time before sentencing at the discretion of the trial judge. Where a withdraw is requested the trial judge is to inquire into the validity of the guilty plea. He may withdraw the plea at their discretion.&lt;Ref&gt; 
R. v. Atlay [http://canlii.ca/t/1d9lc 1992 CanLII 1081 (BCCA)], (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 553 (BCCA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the discretion is reviewable by an appellate court.
 
Where the accused has already been sentenced and wishes to withdraw the guilty plea, the trial judge is ''functus'' and has no jurisdiction to consider an application. An appellate court may only interfere with a guilty plea where the plea resulted in a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot; under s. 686(1)(a)(iii).

If the plea is valid it generally cannot be withdrawn.&lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Arcand, [http://canlii.ca/t/1l719 2000 SKCA 60]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. T.(R) [http://canlii.ca/t/1p793 1992 CanLII 2834] (ON CA), (1992), 17 C.R. (4th) 247 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hector [http://canlii.ca/t/1fb50 2000 CanLII 5725]
&lt;/ref&gt;

A plea in open court by an accused represented by counsel is presumptively valid.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Eide, [http://canlii.ca/t/fm5rg 2011 SKCA 81]&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Swanson, [http://canlii.ca/t/53zp 2000 BCCA 177]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Where the accused is represented by counsel there is a stronger presumption of validity.

The burden is upon the accused to establish the guilty plea as invalid.
&lt;ref&gt; 
R v Eizenga [http://canlii.ca/t/2fmpr#par45 2011 ONCA 113], (2011) 270 CCC (3d) 168 (ONCA) at para 45-46&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Djekic [http://canlii.ca/t/1fb9n 2000 CanLII 16822 (ON CA)], (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 572 (Ont C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Rajaeefard [http://canlii.ca/t/6j70 1996 CanLII 404 (ON CA)], (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Rubenstein [http://canlii.ca/t/22kn1 1987 CanLII 2834 (ON CA)], (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 91 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;Br&gt;

R v R.T. (1992) 10 OR (3d) 514 at p. 519&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/reF&gt;

An ''appellate court'' has the ability to remove a guilty plea and quash a conviction where there are &quot;valid grounds&quot; to do so. What constitutes valid grounds is open-ended and can include a variety of situations.&lt;reF&gt; 
R. v. Taillefer, Duguay, [http://canlii.ca/t/1g992 2003 SCC 70] (CanLII), [2003] S.C.J. No. 75 at 431 &lt;br&gt;
R. v . Adgey, [http://canlii.ca/t/1twzm 1973 CanLII 37] (SCC), [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426 (S.C.C.) &lt;br&gt;
Queen v. Bamsey [http://canlii.ca/t/21vc2 1960 CanLII 35 (SCC)], (1960), S.C.R. 294 at p. 298[http://canlii.ca/t/21vc2]&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Porter [1994] [http://canlii.ca/t/1mqmv#par25 N.S.J. No.304 at para 25]&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;  


&quot;Valid grounds&quot; to withdraw a guilty plea can be in situations where the plea was not validly.
&lt;ref&gt; 
see R. v. Hoang, [http://canlii.ca/t/1g4b9#par30 2003 ABCA 251 at 30] - &quot;the appellant did not appreciate the nature of the charge, or the appellant did not intend to admit that he was guilty of it; or where upon the admitted facts, the appellant could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
This includes where there is:
* a misunderstanding by the accused of the nature of the charge 
* a misunderstanding by the accused of the effect of his plea, such as where
** the accused never intended to admit guilt &lt;Ref&gt;e.g. R. v. S.K., [http://canlii.ca/t/231v4 1995 CanLII 8926 (ONCA)]&lt;/ref&gt;
** there was a serious question as to the accused's mental state at the time of entering the plea
* improper inducements or threats by the police, defence counsel, or the trial judge&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Nevin, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nx31 2006 NSCA 72] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lamoureux, (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 101 (Que.C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Laperrière [http://canlii.ca/t/1nk99 1995 CanLII 4706 (QC CA)], (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 462, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 284&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Djekic [http://canlii.ca/t/1fb9n 2000 CanLII 16822 (ON CA)], (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 572 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Rajaeefard [http://canlii.ca/t/6j70 1996 CanLII 404 (ON CA)], (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* the accused did not fully appreciate the nature of the charge or the effect of the plea.&lt;Ref&gt;
see R. v. Melanson (1983), 59 N.S.R. (2d) 54 (C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

A further situation where the plea can be withdrawn is where there is a miscarriage of justice.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Gates, 2010 BCCA 378, 293 B.C.A.C. 243 at para. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This includes where:
* the accused has been given wrong legal advice&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Armstrong, [http://canlii.ca/t/6hqg 1997 CanLII 1487] (ON CA), (1997) 33 WCB 2d 254 (ONCA) - lawyer gave advice that D was able to get discharge when it was not available
&lt;/ref&gt;
*  if on the admitted facts, he could not be convicted of the offence&lt;reF&gt;
R. v. Melanson (1983), 59 N.S.R. (2d) 54 (C.A.) at para. 6&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider include &lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Joseph, [2000] B.C.J. No. 2850 (Q.L.)(B.C.S.C.) at 48&lt;Br&gt;
R. v.  Stockley, [http://canlii.ca/t/2467r 2009 NLCA 38] at para. 7
&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the accused was represented by (experienced) counsel&lt;ref&gt;Joseph at 48&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the accused was apprised of his position&lt;ref&gt;Joseph at 48&lt;/ref&gt; 
# did the accused have a valid defence&lt;ref&gt;Joseph at 48&lt;/ref&gt;
# was the plea given while under pressure and did he have enough time to contemplate the decision&lt;ref&gt;Joseph at 48&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the accused had experience in the criminal justice system (usually shown by a criminal record)&lt;ref&gt;Joseph at 48&lt;/ref&gt;

If a judge performs the inquiry under s. 606(1.1) then it is unlikely that a judge should set aside the guilty plea.&lt;Ref&gt; R v Brun [http://canlii.ca/t/1mlbx 2006 NBCA 17]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A change of plea is rarely granted, first, because of the mischief it could cause and the lack of certainly in plea deals, second, need to ensure fairness to the victims, complainants and witnesses involved.
&lt;ReF&gt;
R v Hallam, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fw7p 2003 BCPC 333], [2003] BCJ No 2176&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Murphy, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mqdm 1995 CanLII 4329], [1995] N.S.J. No.41 at 10
&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation by counsel is a significant factor.&lt;ReF&gt; R v McCollum 2008 NSCA 36 at 10&lt;/ref&gt;

A co-accused who is acquitted does not change the validity of the guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt; R v Hicks [1991] 3 SCR 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilty plea are more likely be struck where there are english language problems.&lt;ReF&gt;R v Meers [http://canlii.ca/t/1d96w 1991 CanLII 311] (BC CA)&lt;br&gt;
R v Golubev [http://canlii.ca/t/23826 2009 ONCA 333]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there was no meeting between the lawyer and the accused there will be a tendancy to lean towards revoking the guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;R v Golubev [http://canlii.ca/t/23826 2009 ONCA 333]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
===Voluntariness===
An accused who feels under pressure to plead guilty is not generally enough to vitiate voluntariness. It is expected that a persons facing serious charges will feel pressure at the time of plea.&lt;reF&gt;R. v. Carty, [http://canlii.ca/t/290vf 2010 ONCA 237] -- Accused states &quot;I think it is the best way.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Death threats is sufficient to vitiate voluntariness on a guilty plea.&lt;REf&gt;R v Easterbrook [http://canlii.ca/t/1k6vk 2005 CanLII 12676 (ON CA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilty plea motivated by a desire to avoid tougher sentence will not be grounds of striking the plea.&lt;Ref&gt; 
R v Burden [http://canlii.ca/t/6jcz 1996 CanLII 558 (ON CA)] - accused plead guilty on suggestion of a dangerous offender application post trial
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Similarly, it is permissible for crown to suggest that if a guilty plea is entered, bail will not be opposed prior to sentence. &lt;reF&gt;R v Temple 1995 B.C.J. No. 331&lt;/ref&gt;


{{Reflist|2}}

===Equivocation===
Any conditional guilty plea, such as admission of guilt only where a particular outcome be granted, is not a guilty plea at all.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Lucas, (1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 71 at 75: &quot;A conditional plea of guilty is unknown to our law&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A guilty plea is considered conditional where the plea was done on advice of the lawyer who was mistaken to believe that an appeal of conviction and ruling would be possible after the plea was entered.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Fegan (1993) 80 CCC 3d 356&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also conditional where the crown offers to allow a withdraw of a guilty plea if the judge does not adopt the joint recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Kleinsteuber, [http://canlii.ca/t/1dzrd#par4 1997 CanLII 3567] (BC CA) at 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

A withdraw could be supported where the accused asserts a potential valid defence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hunt [http://canlii.ca/t/1glq3#par15 2004 ABCA 88 at 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

A guilty plea made merely to gain some sort of perceived advantage is not enough to invalidate the plea.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Hughes, (1987), 76 A.R. 294 (C.A.)&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Burden [http://canlii.ca/t/6jcz 1996 CanLII 558 (ON CA)], (1996), 90 O.A.C. 169 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Understands Admissions===
The accused must have suffient information regarding the nature of the charges against him.&lt;reF&gt;R v Henry [http://canlii.ca/t/fl10b 2011 ONCA 289] - accused not able to listen to recordings making up allegations before plea, guilty plea invalidated&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused need only be aware of the “essential facts” to make out the charge and not the full extent of the details to plea guilty.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Raymond, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dvfs#par100 2009 QCCA 808 at 100 and 114]
&lt;/ref&gt;
This follows the principle that guilty plea is only a bare admission and not acceptance of all surrounding circumstances.&lt;ref&gt; 
See s. 655 which states &quot;Where an accused is on trial for an indictable offence, he or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against him for the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the accused was not aware of what he was pleading guilty to, then it will struck.&lt;ref&gt;R v .Halvorsen [http://canlii.ca/t/1dcqw 1994 CanLII 1748 (BC CA)]&lt;/ref&gt;


{{Reflist|2}}

===Understand Consequences===
The accused has a right to know the immediate consequence of the gulity plea. This includes the nature of the potential penalties.&lt;reF&gt;
R. v. T. (R.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1p793 1992 CanLII 2834 (ON CA)]
&lt;/ref&gt;This does not include all possible consequences.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Hoang 2003 ABCA at 36&lt;br&gt; R v Raymond, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dvfs#par114 2009 QCCA 808 at 114]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of knowledge of the consequences of pleading guilty is not necessarily determinative.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Slobodan, [1993] A.J. No. 11 (C.A.)
R. v. Tyler, 2007 BCCA 142 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hunt, 2004 ABCA 88 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hoang, 2003 ABCA 251 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Fegan, (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 356 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Claveau, 2003 NBCA 52 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;Instead, more seems to rely upon the impact on the decision, if the accused had been informed.&lt;ref&gt;R v Riley 2010 NSCA at 45&lt;/ref&gt;

“Consequences” of the plea does not include knowledge of the long-term or external consequences to a guilty plea&lt;ref&gt;R v Hunt 2004 ABCA 88 at 15, 16&lt;/ref&gt;, including the impact on their immigration status.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Tyler [http://canlii.ca/t/1qrd4 2007 BCCA 142]&lt;br&gt;
R v Nersysyan [http://canlii.ca/t/1l0bh 2005 QCCA 606]&lt;bR&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts can take into account the overall impact of the gulity plea when deciding whether they understood the consequence.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Riley, [http://canlii.ca/t/flqv9#par45 2011 NSCA 52 at 45]&lt;/reF&gt;


{{Reflist|2}}

===Miscarriage of Justice===
Valid grounds include where there is an appearance of unfairness.&lt;ref&gt;R v Stork (1975) 24 CCC 210 and R v Adgey 1975 at p 431&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfairness would include where the accused was pressured or extorted into pleading guilty.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Lamoureux, (1984) 13 CCC (3d) 101 (QCCA)&lt;br&gt;
R v Temple [1995] BCJ No 331 (BCCA)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Procedure for Appeal===

Proving the invalidity of a guilty plea may be established by the record. However, if it is not apparent from the record, the court must have the appellant file his &quot;own affidavit and any other affidavit that might be relevant to the issue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Wiebe, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfd0 2012 BCCA 519] (CanLII) at para. 22&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

If the grounds includes an allegation of misconduct or incompetence of previous defence counsel, the Crown may get a affidavit from the previous defence counsel to respond to the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;
Wiebe at para. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The previous defence counsel is still bound by solicitor-client privilege unless waived.

Under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec683 s. 683], either side may apply to cross-examine the affiant.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. Wiebe at para. 22&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hannon, 1999 BCCA 56 (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Plea to Lesser Offences==
A judge can accept a guilty plea to an offence listed in the charge ''or'' any other charge arising from the same transaction where the Crown consents. 
Under s. 606(4), a guilty plea to a lesser included offence in permissible as stated:

{{quotation|
s. 606...&lt;p&gt;
'''Included or other offence'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, where an accused or defendant pleads not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of any other offence arising out of the same transaction, whether or not it is an included offence, the court may, with the consent of the prosecutor, accept that plea of guilty and, if the plea is accepted, the court shall find the accused or defendant not guilty of the offence charged and find him guilty of the offence in respect of which the plea of guilty was accepted and enter those findings in the record of the court.
&lt;P&gt;
...&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 606; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 125; 2002, c. 13, s. 49.|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec606]
}}

Even where the crown consents to accepting a guilty plea for a lesser offence, the judge has discretion to reject it.&lt;ref&gt; R v Naraindeen (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 120 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Social_Games&amp;diff=2313000&amp;oldid=2312999 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* Have an introduction section up top--you do that by having the first section of the page have no section header.
* ''&quot;and have a demographic which is 74% female&quot;''--This is interesting. Without dwelling on it too much, compare that to other gaming niches and provide references.
* ''&quot;Social and casual gaming is expanding rapidly.&quot;''--This is redundant
* ''&quot;Ricochet:Infinity, had a player base in which 92% of users pirated the game&quot;''--This needs a reference.
* ''FarmVille''--Any statistics on distribution of who pays how much?
* ''League of Legends''--This reads a bit confusing.
* ''Zynga''--Combine this section with the FarmVille section.
* ''Riot games''--Combine this section with the League of Legends section.
* ''The stigma of paying for success''--This section needs references.
* Overall:
** This reads like a draft, there are mis-capitalizations mis-spellings and blatant grammar errors. Try to clean it up.
** Try to get at the issues of network externalities: Does a game need a large audience (of non-paying customers) in order to make the game attractive to paying customers? Or is it just like a casino where they want to draw in as many people as possible, hoping to find the few who will pay lots of money?
** Talk more about the &quot;viral&quot; nature of some of the games, where the game mechanic encourages recruiting friends to play.
* ''References''
** Try to format your references so they have useful information/titles, etc. 
** Wikipedia is not a good reference.

==The Moon==
The Earth itself is very interesting, however, so is its moon. The Moon or Luna is 384,000 kilometers from the Earth. It has a radius of 1,738 kilometer and weighs 7.35 x1022 kilograms. The moon is 1/80th the mass of the earth and 1/4th its diameter. An interesting thing about the moon is that it slows the Earth’s rotation by two milliseconds every century. This means that 900 million years ago, there were 481 days and 18 hours in an Earth year. The moon’s orbit is very nearly circular and one lunar day and night is almost fifteen Earth days. The temperature on the moon changes drastically depending on whether it is day or night. At night, the temperature can drop to almost -113° Celsius. During the day, temperatures can reach 100° Celsius. This is all because the moon does not have surface water or an atmosphere.

==The Sun==

When looking at our solar system, it is first important to look at the sun, which makes up 98% of the mass in the solar system. The gravity of the sun is so powerful that it attracts everything else in the solar system, which is why we orbit it. The sun has lived for approximately 4.5 billion years and is expected to live for another 5 billion years or so. The sun is very large, 109 Earths would make up the diameter and 1.3 million Earths would fit inside of it. The visible layer of the sun is called the photosphere. Photosphere means light sphere therefore we can see it. Temperatures in the photosphere can reach 6,000° Celsius. All of the energy powering the sun is created in the core where temperatures are up to 15 million° Celsius. From the core, the energy will take almost a million years to reach the surface. The actual composition of the sun is mostly hydrogen and helium. 

The sun, like the planets, has an atmosphere. The outer part of the atmosphere is called the corona and is where prominences occur. Prominences are immense clouds of glowing gas. They erupt from the upper chromospheres and can only be seen during total solar eclipses. Solar winds are also a part of the Sun’s atmosphere. They are atomic particles that are blown outward from the Sun. They stretch across a lot of the solar system and are deflected by the magnetic fields of planets. When the solar winds aren’t deflected, auroras can be seen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Strategy in the PC vs. Console Market ===

For PC games: because with the technology going so fast. More and more new PC games are coming out which makes PC’s hardware need to update more frequently. The PC users need to spend more and more money to make their PC’s quality better to play the newest game. However, video game console doesn’t have that kind of problem. Usually a video game console like XBOX has at least more than two years service life. The user never needs to worry about change the hardware to a better one. All they need to do is just buy the game. It makes for both game console producer and game developer cost a lot less money for changing new equipments. And which makes the game console cheaper more competitive. 

The market for the development of online PC Games differs from that of the console game market in several ways:

•  Developers can avoid manufacturers' licensing fees. PC Games can generally be run on any PC related hardware, whereas console games are limited strictly to the technology associated with the platform for which the game is released.

•  Low overall development costs, including the avoidance of expensive development packages, allow the break-even quantity for high-quality a computer game produced in 2002 to be around 90,000 units, compared to the 500,000 break-even quantity required for license-laden Nintendo games &lt;ref&gt; Structure and Competition in the U.S. Home Video Game Industry, by Dmitri Williams, University of Michigan, USA &lt;/ref&gt;

•  PC games can be developed by small groups of individuals, whereas console games are generally developed by large corporations who are able to cover the costs of development packages. This allows for a much broader array of games, across many genres, to be produced. One of the most popular online first-person shooter games of all time, [[w:Counter-Strike|Counter-Strike]], was originally created by Minh &quot;Gooseman&quot; Le and Jess &quot;Cliffe&quot; Cliffe, two individuals who developed the game by modifying code from the game [[w:Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike &lt;/ref&gt; Although their creation was eventually published and distributed through [[w:Valve Corporation|Valve]], Gooseman and Cliffe were responsible for its initial creation.

=== Success in video game production ===

[[w:Activision|Activision]] owns the rights to many of the most popular games available.  They are responsible for bestselling games on various different consoles.  Activision has recently acquired 7 more game development studios and has assigned to each of those studios the task of creating a single game.  Assuming the games are a success, the studio will continue to make the sequels to each game.  Activision’s motto is “one game per studio.” This allows for the creation of a single game to be the sole focus of the studio, contributing to better continuity, communication, consistency, and attention to detail, as well as response to consumer demand.  Activision has repeatedly released top selling games and sequels.  This is due in part to the focused allocation of time and money that goes into producing a single game title and subsequent iterations.  Activison’s Executive Vice President David Stohl said, &quot;I think we have done a really good job, in fact, we have done probably the best in the industry ... But you've gotta anticipate things -- things like new hardware, hardware transitions, the cycles of it all, that kind of stuff -- and then anticipate, and try to be smart about it.&quot;  Their “one game strategy” is promising for the short run, but Stohl knows that it is vital to be aware of technological advancements that will continue to improve and transform gaming and game developing.  Activision’s strategy will likely continue to change. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.joystiq.com/2010/07/07/activision-studios-head-brings-development-strategy-into-focus/ &lt;/ref&gt;

[[w:Electronic Arts|Electronic Arts]], also known as EA games, were once only marketed to computer and software companies for stock computers when the company was founded in 1982. Today, they are the world's largest video game production studio and own more game series than any other studio. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts&lt;/ref&gt; EA's success is largely due to the mergers and acquisitions the company has acquired over its existence. Many critics feel the company is harsh to its employees due to its drastic measures to cut staff and game productions as well as working their teams long hours to meet sales goals and to keep their profit margins green. EA believes it is beginning to cut old patterns of management but wants to ensure that quality in product development will not be sacrificed.

      <comment>/* Boolean Expressions (Boolean... what?!?) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

(Our final lesson before we get into interacting with human input. Can't wait, can you?)

Just imagine you needed a program to do something 20 times. What would you do? You could copy and paste the code 20 times, and have a virtually unreadable program. Or, you could tell the computer to repeat a bit of code between point A and point B, until the time comes that you need it to stop. Such a thing is called a loop.

== The &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop ==

The following are examples of a type of loop, called the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop:

;Code Example 1 – The &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 0
while a &lt; 10:
    a = a + 1
    print a
&lt;/source&gt;
How does this program work? Let's go through it in English (this is called [[w:pseudocode|pseudocode]]):

;Code Example 2 – Plain-language &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop
&lt;pre&gt;
'a' now equals 0
As long as 'a' is less than 10, do the following:
    Make 'a' one larger than what it already is.
    print on-screen what 'a' is now worth.
&lt;/pre&gt;
What does this do? Let's go through what the computer would be 'thinking' when it is in the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop:

;Code Example 3 – &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop process
&lt;pre&gt;
#JUST GLANCE OVER THIS QUICKLY
#(It looks fancy, but is really simple.)
Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 0)
Make 'a' one larger (now 1)
print on-screen what 'a' is (1)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 1)
Make 'a' one larger (now 2)
print on-screen what 'a' is (2)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 2)
Make 'a' one larger (now 3)
print on-screen what 'a' is (3)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 3)
Make 'a' one larger (now 4)
print on-screen what 'a' is (4)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 4)
Make 'a' one larger (now 5)
print on-screen what 'a' is (5)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 5)
Make 'a' one larger (now 6)
print on-screen what 'a' is (6)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 6)
Make 'a' one larger (now 7)
print on-screen what 'a' is (7)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (are you still here?)
Make 'a' one larger (now 8)
print on-screen what 'a' is (8)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 8)
Make 'a' one larger (now 9)
print on-screen what 'a' is (9)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 9)
Make 'a' one larger (now 10)
print on-screen what 'a' is (10)

Is 'a' less than 10? NO (it's 10, therefore isn't less than 10)
Don't do the loop
There's no code left to do, so the program ends.
&lt;/pre&gt;
So in short, try to think of it that way when you write &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loops. This is how you write them, by the way:

;Code Example 4 – &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop form
&lt;pre&gt;
while {condition that the loop continues}:
    {what to do in the loop}
    {have it indented, usually four spaces}
{the code here is not looped}
{because it isn't indented}
&lt;/pre&gt;

An example:

;Code Example 5 – &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop example
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#EXAMPLE
#Type this in and see what it does.
x = 10
while x != 0:
    print x
    x = x - 1
    print &quot;Wow, we've counted x down, and now it equals&quot;, x
print &quot;And now the loop has ended.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Remember, to make a program, you open IDLE, click 'File &gt; New Window', type your program in the new window, then press {{key press|F5}} to run.

== Boolean Expressions (Boolean... what?!?) ==

What do you type in the area marked {conditions that the loop continues}? The answer is a boolean expression.

What? A forgotten concept for the non-math people here. Never mind, boolean expression just means a question that can be answered with a TRUE or FALSE response. For example, if you wanted to say your age is the same as the person next to you, you would type:

My age == the age of the person next to me

And the statement would be TRUE. If you were younger than the person opposite, you'd say:

My age &lt; the age of the person opposite me

And the statement would be TRUE. If, however, you were to say the following, and the person opposite of you was younger than you:

My age &lt; the age of the person opposite me

The statement would be FALSE - the truth is that it is the other way around. This is how a loop thinks - if the expression is true, keep looping. If it is false, don't loop. With this in mind, lets have a look at the operators (symbols that represent an action) that are involved in boolean expressions:

{| width=40% border=1
  |+ Table 1 - Boolean operators
|-
  ! Expression
  ! Function
|-
|&lt;
|less than
|-
|&lt;=
|less than or equal to
|-
|&gt;
|greater than
|-
|&gt;=
|greater than or equal to
|-
|!=
|not equal to
|-
|&lt;&gt;
|not equal to (alternate, != preferred)
|-
|==
|equal to
|}

Dont get '=' and '==' mixed up - the '=' operator makes what is on the left equal to what is on the right. the '==' operator says whether the thing on the left is the same as what is on the right, and returns true or false.

== Conditional Statements ==

OK! We've (hopefully) covered 'while' loops. Now let's look at something a little different - conditionals.

Conditionals are where a section of code is only run if certain conditions are met. This is similar to the 'while' loop you just wrote, which only runs when x doesn't equal 0. However, Conditionals are only run once. The most common conditional in any program language, is the 'if' statement. Here is how it works:

;Code Example 6 - if statement and example
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
'''
if {conditions to be met}:
    {do this}
    {and this}
    {and this}
{but this happens regardless}
{because it isn't indented}
'''

#EXAMPLE 1
y = 1
if y == 1:
    print &quot;y still equals 1, I was just checking&quot;

#EXAMPLE 2
print &quot;We will show the even numbers up to 20&quot;
n = 1
while n &lt;= 20:
    n = n + 1
    if n % 2 == 0:    
           print n
print &quot;there, done.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Example 2 there looks tricky. But all we have done is run an 'if' statement every time the 'while' loop runs. Remember that the % just means the remainder from a division - just checking that there is nothing left over if the number is divided by two - showing it is even. If it is even, it prints what 'n' is.

== 'else' and 'elif' - When it Ain't True ==

There are many ways you can use the 'if' statement, to deal with situations where your boolean expression ends up FALSE. They are 'else' and 'elif'.

'else' simply tells the computer what to do if the conditions of 'if' aren't met. For example, read the following:

;Code Example 7 - the else statement
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
if a &gt; 5:
    print &quot;This shouldn't happen.&quot;
else:
    print &quot;This should happen.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
'a' is not greater than five, therefore what is under 'else' is done.

'elif' is just a shortened way of saying 'else if'. When the 'if' statement fails to be true, 'elif' will do what is under it IF the conditions are met. For example:

;Code Example 8 - The elif statement
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
z = 4
if z &gt; 70:
    print &quot;Something is very wrong&quot;
elif z &lt; 7:
    print &quot;This is normal&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
The 'if' statement, along with 'else' and 'elif' follow this form:

;Code Example 9 - the complete if syntax
&lt;pre&gt;
if {conditions}:
    {run this code}
elif {conditions}:
    {run this code}
elif {conditions}:
    {run this code}
else:
    {run this code}

#You can have as many or as few elif statements as you need
#anywhere from zero to the sky.
#You can have at most one else statement
#and only after all other ifs and elifs.
&lt;/pre&gt;
One of the most important points to remember is that you MUST have a colon (:) at the end of every line with an 'if', 'elif', 'else' or 'while' in it. I forgot that, and as a result a stack of people got stumped at this lesson (sorry ;)).

== Indentation ==

One other point is that the code to be executed if the conditions are met, MUST BE INDENTED. That means that if you want to loop the next five lines with a 'while' loop, you must put a set number of spaces at the beginning of each of the next five lines. This is good programming practice in any language, but python requires that you do it. Here is an example of both of the above points:

;Code Example 10 - Indentation
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 10
while a &gt; 0:
    print(a)
    if a &gt; 5:
        print(&quot;Big number!&quot;)
    elif a % 2 != 0:
        print(&quot;This is an odd number&quot;)
        print(&quot;It isn't greater than five, either&quot;)
    else:
        print(&quot;this number isn't greater than 5&quot;)
        print(&quot;nor is it odd&quot;)
        print(&quot;feeling special?&quot;)
    a = a - 1
    print(&quot;we just made 'a' one less than what it was!&quot;)
    print(&quot;and unless a is not greater than 0, we'll do the loop again.&quot;)
print(&quot;well, it seems as if 'a' is now no bigger than 0!&quot;)
print(&quot;the loop is now over, and without furthur ado, so is this program!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
Notice the three levels of indents there:

Each line in the first level starts with no spaces. It is the main program, and will always execute.
Each line in the second level starts with four spaces. When there is an 'if' or loop on the first level, everything on the second level after that will be looped/'ifed', until a new line starts back on the first level again.
Each line in the third level starts with eight spaces. When there is an 'if' or loop on the second level, everything on the third level after that will be looped/'ifed', until a new line starts back on the second level again.
This goes on infinitely, until the person writing the program has an internal brain explosion, and cannot understand anything he/she has written.
There is another loop, called the 'for' loop, but we will cover that in a later lesson, after we have learnt about lists.

==The Moon==
The Earth itself is very interesting, however, so is its moon. The Moon or Luna is 384,000 kilometers from the Earth. It has a radius of 1,738 kilometer and weighs 7.35 x 10^22 kilograms. The moon is 1/80th the mass of the earth and 1/4th its diameter. An interesting thing about the moon is that it slows the Earth’s rotation by two milliseconds every century. This means that 900 million years ago, there were 481 days and 18 hours in an Earth year. The moon’s orbit is very nearly circular and one lunar day and night is almost fifteen Earth days. The temperature on the moon changes drastically depending on whether it is day or night. At night, the temperature can drop to almost -113° Celsius. During the day, temperatures can reach 100° Celsius. This is all because the moon does not have surface water or an atmosphere.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Mercury==

The first planet orbiting the sun travelling outwards is Mercury. Since it is the closest plant to the sun, Mercury orbits around the Sun at a faster pace than any other planet. It only takes 88 Earth days for Mercury to orbit the Sun. However one day on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days. During the day, the temperature on Mercury reaches 450° C but at night it drops down to negative 170° C. The sunlight that reaches the surface of Mercury is six times brighter and more intense than that on the Earth. 

Mercury is the second densest major body in the solar system after the Earth. But an object that weighs 100 pounds on Earth would only way 38 pounds on Mercury. The interior of Mercury resembles that of the Earth and consists of a large iron core. The surface has cratered terrains, smooth plains, and is mostly made of rock and metal. There are many deep craters like those on the Moon’s surface. Scientists have proven that the floors of craters at the poles contain ice because they are permanently shielded from the Sun and thus never melt. Mercury’s atmosphere is dry, extremely hot, and almost airless. The gravity on Mercury is too weak to maintain a significant atmosphere for long periods of time and thus too weak to contain any moons in orbit. The magnetic field is about one percent as strong as that of the Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Venus==

The next planet on our journey outwards is Venus, the 6th largest planet. Venus’ orbit is nearly circular. It is the brightest object in the sky from Earth except for the Sun and the Moon. One Venus day is equivalent to 243 Earth days. However Venus is very similar to Earth and regarded as Earth’s sister planet. It is 95% of Earth’s diameter and 80% of its mass. 

The physical makeup of Venus used to consist of large amounts of water which have since boiled away. The surface is made of gently rolling plains, several broad depressions as well as two large highland areas. Much of the surface is covered in lava flow. Venus also has several large shield volcanoes on its surface. The oldest terrain on Venus is 800 million years old because volcanism has erased all the previous surfaces. The interior is similar of Venus is similar to that of the Earth. The atmosphere is mostly made of carbon dioxide with several layers of clouds many kilometers thick made of sulfuric acid. There is no magnetic field and no moons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Mars==

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is referred to as the red planet. Mars has half the diameter of the Earth. On the surface there are signs of ancient floods. The average temperature on Mars’ surface is negative 55° C but there are seasons and weather. 

Astronomers have proof of permanent polar ice caps on Mars. The surface is very old and cratered but there are young valleys, ridges and plains. There is evidence of erosion on the surface due to some type of fluid. However the surface of Mars is very cold with very strong winds and vast dust storms. These dust storms have been known to engulf the entire planet for months. The atmosphere on Mars is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. The atmosphere consists of 95% carbon dioxide, 3% nitrogen and 2% argon. The magnetic fields are large but not global. They are probably remnants of a larger global field that has since disappeared. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Jupiter==

Jupiter follows Mars. Jupiter has high velocity winds confined in wide bands of latitude. It is most known for the great red spot which has been seen for 300 years. Its oval shape is big enough to fit two earths. The rotation of Jupiter is gradual slowing down due to the tidal drag produced by the satellites. A little known fact about Jupiter is that it has rings like Saturn’s but much thinner. They are dark and composed of very small grains of rocky material. In the grand scheme of things, the rings will most likely not last much longer. 

Jupiter does not have a solid surface. It instead consists of gaseous material which just becomes denser with depth. It is essentially 90% hydrogen and 10% helium. The composition is similar to that of Saturn. However not much is known about the interior. It is most likely a rocky core with liquid metallic hydrogen above the care. The interior does have a temperature of 20,000° K. The magnetic field is much stronger than that of Earth’s. Jupiter has 4 large moons, discovered by Galileo. They are referred to as Galilean moons and are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. There are also 59 other, smaller, moons in orbit around Jupiter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Saturn==

Saturn has 2 prominent rings and one faint ring that can be seen from Earth. They are known as A, B, and C, where C is the faintest ring seen. Each is composed of very small objects, and each in an independent orbit. The rings are about 250,000 km in diameter but only one km thick. They contain very little material, mostly water and ice. The rings of Saturn are not stable but continuously regenerated in an ongoing process. The current set of rings is only a few hundred million years old. Saturn itself is oblate, visibly flattened due to its rotation and fluid state. It is the least dense of all of the planets and has a gravity of .7. 

Saturn is made up of 75% hydrogen and 25% helium. The interior of Saturn is similar to Jupiter and thus not much about it is known. The core temperature is 12,000° K. Saturn does have a magnetic field which is very large.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Uranus==

Uranus is the first planet that was discovered in modern times. It was previously disregarded as another star in the sky. A unique feature about Uranus is that the axis is nearly parallel to the ecliptic so the South Pole points almost directly at the sun. However the equator is hotter than at the poles. The blue color of the planet is the result of the absorption of red light. Uranus has 13 known rings which are dark and composed of large particles. 

Uranus is made up of rock and various ices. The core is the same as Jupiter and Saturn, and thus similar to other gas planets. Uranus has bands of clouds that blow around rapidly. The atmosphere is 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2% methane. The magnetic field is titled almost 60° in respect to the axis of rotation. Uranus has 27 named moons and for respect to the length of this paper, not all will be named.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Neptune==

Neptune, the last planet on our journey, radiates twice as much energy than what it receives from the Sun. The planet of Neptune has its own great dark spot about half the size of the great red spot. Neptune does have its own set of rings but they appear incomplete. However it’s just that some parts of the rings are brighter than others. Like the rings of Jupiter and Uranus, Neptune’s rings are not easily visible from Earth.

Neptune’s physical makeup is similar to Uranus. Neptune consists of various ices and rock but is less uniform in composition. It most likely has a small core. The winds on the planet are confined bands of latitude. They are the fastest winds in the solar system. The magnetic field of Neptune is similar to Uranus’ in that it is oddly orientated. Neptune has 13 known moons but the main one is Triton.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Last lesson I said that we would delve into purposefull programming. That involves user input, and user input requires a thing called functions.

What are functions? Well, in effect, functions are little self-contained programs that perform a specific task, which you can incorporate into your own, larger programs. After you have created a function, you can use it at any time, in any place. This saves you the time and effort of having to retell the computer what to do every time it does a common task, for example getting the user to type something in.

== Using a function ==

Python has lots of pre-made functions, that you can use right now, simply by 'calling' them. 'Calling' a function involves you giving a function input, and it will return a value (like a variable would) as output. Don't understand? Here is the general form that calling a function takes:

;Code Example 1 - How to call a function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
function_name(parameters)
&lt;/source&gt;

See? Easy.

function_name identifies which function it is you want to use (you'd figure...). For example, the function raw_input, which will be the first function that we will use.
Parameters are the values you pass to the function to tell it what it should do, and how to do it.. for example, if a function multiplied any given number by five, the stuff in parameters tells the function which number it should multiply by five. Put the number 70 into parameters, and the function will do 70×5.

== Parameters and Returned Values - Communicating with Functions ==

Well, that's all well and good that the program can multiply a number by five, but what does it have to show for it? A warm fuzzy feeling? Your program needs to see the results of what happened, to see what 70 x 5 is, or to see if there is a problem somewhere (like you gave it a letter instead of a number). So how does a function show what it does?

Well, in effect, when a computer runs a function, it doesn't actually see the function name, but the result of what the function did. Variables do the exact same thing - the computer doesn't see the variable name, it sees the value that the variable holds. Lets call this program that multiplied any number by five, multiply(). You put the number you want multiplied in the brackets. So if you typed this:

;Code Example 2 - Using a function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = multiply(70)
&lt;/source&gt;
The computer would actually see this:

;Code Example 3 - What the computer sees
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 350
&lt;/source&gt;
Note: don't bother typing in this code - multiply() isn't a real function, unless you create it.

The function ran itself, then returned a number to the main program, based on what parameters it was given.

Now let's try this with a real function, and see what it does. The function is called input, and asks the user to type in something. It then turns it into a string of text. Try the code below:

;Code Example 4 - Using raw_input
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# this line makes 'a' equal to whatever you type in
a = input(&quot;Type in something, and it will be repeated on screen:&quot;)
# this line prints what 'a' is now worth
print a
&lt;/source&gt;
Say in the above program, you typed in 'hello' when it asked you to type something in. To the computer, this program would look like this:

;Code Example 5 - What the computer sees
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = &quot;hello&quot;
print &quot;hello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Remember, a variable is just a stored value. To the computer, the variable 'a' doesn't look like 'a' - it looks like the value that is stored inside it. Functions are similar - to the main program (that is, the program that is running the function), they look like the value of what they give in return of running.

== A Calculator Program ==

Let's write another program, that will act as a calculator. This time it will do something more adventerous than what we have done before. There will be a menu, that will ask you whether you want to multiply two numbers together, add two numbers together, divide one number by another, or subtract one number from another. Only problem - the raw_input function returns what you type in as a string - we want the number 1, not the letter 1 (and yes, in python, there is a difference.).

Luckily, somebody wrote the function input, which returns what you typed in, to the main program - but this time, it puts it in as a number. If you type an integer (a whole number), what comes out of input is an integer. And if you put that integer into a variable, the variable will be an integer-type variable, which means you can add and subtract, etc.

Now, lets design this calculator properly. We want a menu that is returned to every time you finish adding, subtracting, etc. In other words, to loop (HINT!!!) while (BIG HINT!!!) you tell it the program should still run.

We want it to do an option in the menu if you type in that number. That involves you typing in a number (a.k.a input) and an if loop.

Lets write it out in understandable English first:

;Code Example 6 - human-language example
&lt;pre&gt;
START PROGRAM
print opening message

while we let the program run, do this:
    #Print what options you have
    print Option 1 - add
    print Option 2 - subtract
    print Option 3 - multiply
    print Option 4 - divide
    print Option 5 - quit program
    
    ask for which option it is you want
    if it is option 1:
        ask for first number
        ask for second number
        add them together
        print the result onscreen
    if it is option 2:
        ask for first number
        ask for second number
        subtract one from the other
        print the result onscreen
    if it is option 3:
        ask for first number
        ask for second number
        multiply!
        print the result onscreen
    if it is option 4:
        ask for first number
        ask for second number
        divide one by the other
        print the result onscreen
    if it is option 5:
        tell the loop to stop looping
Print onscreen a goodbye message
END PROGRAM
&lt;/pre&gt;
Lets put this in something that Python can understand:

;Code Example 7 - Python version of menu
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#calculator program

#this variable tells the loop whether it should loop or not.
# 1 means loop. anything else means don't loop.

loop = 1

#this variable holds the user's choice in the menu:

choice = 0

while loop == 1:
    #print what options you have
    print &quot;Welcome to calculator.py&quot;

    print &quot;your options are:&quot;
    print &quot; &quot;
    print &quot;1) Addition&quot;
    print &quot;2) Subtraction&quot;

    print &quot;3) Multiplication&quot;

    print &quot;4) Division&quot;
    print &quot;5) Quit calculator.py&quot;
    print &quot; &quot;

    choice = input(&quot;Choose your option: &quot;)
    if choice == 1:
        add1 = input(&quot;Add this: &quot;)
        add2 = input(&quot;to this: &quot;)
        print add1, &quot;+&quot;, add2, &quot;=&quot;, add1 + add2
    elif choice == 2:
        sub2 = input(&quot;Subtract this: &quot;)
        sub1 = input(&quot;from this: &quot;)
        print sub1, &quot;-&quot;, sub2, &quot;=&quot;, sub1 - sub2
    elif choice == 3:
        mul1 = input(&quot;Multiply this: &quot;)
        mul2 = input(&quot;with this: &quot;)
        print mul1, &quot;*&quot;, mul2, &quot;=&quot;, mul1 * mul2
    elif choice == 4:
        div1 = input(&quot;Divide this: &quot;)
        div2 = input(&quot;by this: &quot;)
        print div1, &quot;/&quot;, div2, &quot;=&quot;, div1 / div2
    elif choice == 5:
        loop = 0
	
print &quot;Thank you for using calculator.py!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Wow! That is an impressive program! Paste it into Python IDLE, save it as 'calculator.py' and run it. Play around with it - try all options, entering in integers (numbers without decimal points), and numbers with stuff after the decimal point (known in programming as a floating point). Try typing in text, and see how the program chucks a minor fit, and stops running (That can be dealt with, using error handling, which we can address later.)

== Define Your Own Functions ==

Well, it is all well and good that you can use other people's functions, but what if you want to write your own functions, to save time, and maybe use them in other programs? This is where the 'def' operator comes in. (An operator is just something that tells python what to do, e.g. the '+' operator tells python to add things, the 'if' operator tells python to do something if conditions are met.)

This is how the 'def' operator works:

;Code Example 8 - The def operator
&lt;pre&gt;
def function_name(parameter_1, parameter_2):
    {this is the code in the function}
    {more code}
    {more code}
    return {value to return to the main program}
{this code isn't in the function}
{because it isn't indented}
#remember to put a colon &quot;:&quot; at the end
#of the line that starts with 'def'
&lt;/pre&gt;
function_name is the name of the function. You write the code that is in the function below that line, and have it indented. (We will worry about parameter_1 and parameter_2 later, for now imagine there is nothing between the parentheses.

Functions run completely independent of the main program. Remember when I said that when the computer comes to a function, it doesn't see the function, but a value, that the function returns? Here's the quote:

Functions run completely independent of the main program. Remember when I said that when the computer comes to a function, it doesn't see the function, but a value, that the function returns? Here's the quote:

To the computer, the variable 'a' doesn't look like 'a' - it looks like the value that is stored inside it. Functions are similar - to the main program (that is, the program that is running the function), they look like the value of what they give in return of running.

A function is like a miniture program that some parameters are given to - it then runs itself, and then returns a value. Your main program sees only the returned value. If that function flew to the moon and back, and then at the end had:

;Code Example 9 - return
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
return &quot;Hello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
then all your program would see is the string &quot;hello&quot;, where the name of the function was. It would have no idea what else the program did.

Because it is a separate program, a function doesn't see any of the variables that are in your main program, and your main program doesn't see any of the variables that are in a function. For example, here is a function that prints the words &quot;hello&quot; onscreen, and then returns the number '1234' to the main program:

;Code Example 10 - using return
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Below is the function
def hello():
    print &quot;hello&quot;
    return 1234

# And here is the function being used
print hello()
&lt;/source&gt;
Think about the last line of code above. What did it do? Type in the program (you can skip the comments), and see what it does. The output looks like this:

;Code Example 11 - the output
&lt;pre&gt;
hello
1234
&lt;/pre&gt;
So what happened?

when 'def hello()' was run, a function called 'hello' was created
When the line 'print hello()' was run, the function 'hello' was executed (The code inside it was run)
The function 'hello' printed &quot;hello&quot; onscreen, then returned the number '1234' back to the main program
The main program now sees the line as 'print 1234' and as a result, printed '1234
That accounts for everything that happened. remember, that the main program had NO IDEA that the words &quot;hello&quot; were printed onscreen. All it saw was '1234', and printed that onscreen.

== Passing Parameters to Functions ==

There is one more thing we will cover in this (monsterously huge) lesson - passing parameters to a function. Think back to how we defined functions:

;Code Example 12 - Defining functions with parameters
&lt;pre&gt;
def function_name(parameter_1,parameter_2):
    {this is the code in the function}
    {more code}
    {more code}
    return {value (e.g. text or number) to return to the main program}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Where parameter_1 and parameter_2 are (between the parentheses), you put the names of variables that you want to put the parameters into. Put as many as you need, just have them seperated by commas. When you run a function, the first value you put inside the parentheses would go into the variable where parameter_1 is. The second one (after the first comma) would go to the variable where parameter_2 is. This goes on for however many parameters there are in the function (from zero, to the sky) For example:

;Code Example 13 - how parameters work
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def funny_function(first_word, second_word, third_word):
    print &quot;The word created is: &quot; + first_word + second_word + third_word
    return first_word + second_word + third_word
&lt;/source&gt;
When you run the function above, you would type in something like this: &lt;code&gt;funny_function(&quot;meat&quot;, &quot;eater&quot;, &quot;man&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;. The first value (that is, &quot;meat&quot;) would be put into the variable called first_word. The second value inside the brackets (that is, &quot;eater&quot;) would be put into the variable called second_word, and so on. This is how values are passed from the main program to functions - inside the parentheses, after the function name.

== A Final Program ==

Think back to that calculator program. Did it look a bit messy to you? I think it did, so lets re-write it, with functions.

To design - First we will define all the functions we are going to use with the 'def' operator (still remember what an operator is ;) ). Then we will have the main program, with all that messy code replaced with nice, neat functions. This will make it so much easier to look at again in the future.

;Code Example 14 - Calculator program
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# calculator program

# NO CODE IS REALLY RUN HERE, IT IS ONLY TELLING US WHAT WE WILL DO LATER
# Here we will define our functions
# this prints the main menu, and prompts for a choice
def menu():
    #print what options you have
    print &quot;Welcome to calculator.py&quot;
    print &quot;your options are:&quot;
    print &quot; &quot;
    print &quot;1) Addition&quot;
    print &quot;2) Subtraction&quot;
    print &quot;3) Multiplication&quot;
    print &quot;4) Division&quot;
    print &quot;5) Quit calculator.py&quot;
    print &quot; &quot;
    return input (&quot;Choose your option: &quot;)
    
# this adds two numbers given
def add(a,b):
    print a, &quot;+&quot;, b, &quot;=&quot;, a + b
    
# this subtracts two numbers given
def sub(a,b):
    print b, &quot;-&quot;, a, &quot;=&quot;, b - a
    
# this multiplies two numbers given
def mul(a,b):
    print a, &quot;*&quot;, b, &quot;=&quot;, a * b
    
# this divides two numbers given
def div(a,b):
    print a, &quot;/&quot;, b, &quot;=&quot;, a / b
    
# NOW THE PROGRAM REALLY STARTS, AS CODE IS RUN
loop = 1
choice = 0
while loop == 1:
    choice = menu()
    if choice == 1:
        add(input(&quot;Add this: &quot;),input(&quot;to this: &quot;))
    elif choice == 2:
        sub(input(&quot;Subtract this: &quot;),input(&quot;from this: &quot;))
    elif choice == 3:
        mul(input(&quot;Multiply this: &quot;),input(&quot;by this: &quot;))
    elif choice == 4:
        div(input(&quot;Divide this: &quot;),input(&quot;by this: &quot;))
    elif choice == 5:
        loop = 0

print &quot;Thank you for using calculator.py!&quot;

# NOW THE PROGRAM REALLY FINISHES
&lt;/source&gt;
The initial program had 34 lines of code. The new one actually had 35 lines of code! It is a little longer, but if you look at it the right way, it is actually simpler.

You defined all your functions at the top. This really isn't part of your main program - they are just lots of little programs, that you will call upon later. You could even re-use these in another program if you needed them, and didn't want to tell the computer how to add and subtract again.

If you look at the main part of the program (between the line 'loop = 1' and 'print &quot;Thank you for...&quot;'), it is only 15 lines of code. That means that if you wanted to write this program differently, you would only have to write 15 or so lines, as opposed to the 34 lines you would normally have to without functions.

== Tricky Ways You Can Pass Parameters ==

Finally, as a bit of an interlude, I will explain what the line &lt;code&gt;add(input(&quot;Add this: &quot;), input(&quot;to this: &quot;))&lt;/code&gt; means.

I wanted to fit everything onto one line, with as few variables as possible. Remember what functions look like to the main program? Whatever value they return. If the numbers you passed to the add() function were 2 and 30, the main program would see this:

;Code Example 15 - The results of fancy parameter work
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        add(2, 30)
&lt;/source&gt;
The add program would then run, adding 2 and 30, then printing the result. The add program has no 'return' operator - it doesn't return anything to the main program. It simply adds two numbers and prints them onscreen, and the main program doesn't see anything of it.

Instead of &lt;code&gt;(input(&quot;Add this: &quot;), input(&quot;to this: &quot;))&lt;/code&gt; as the parameters for the add program, you could have variables. For example,

;Code Example 16 - variables as parameters
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
num1 = 45
num2 = 7
add(num1, num2)
&lt;/source&gt;
For the above, remember that the function you are passing the variables to cannot change the variables themselves - they are simply used as values. You could even put the values straight into the function:

;Code Example 17 - the end result
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
add(45, 7)
&lt;/source&gt;
This is because the only thing the function sees are the values that are passed on as parameters. Those values are put into the variables that are mentioned when 'add' is defined (the line 'def add(a,b)' ). The function then uses those parameters to do its job.

In short:

* the only thing functions see of the main program is the parameters that are passed to it
* the only thing the main program seens of functions is the returned value that it passes back

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Your brain still hurting from the last lesson? Never worry, this one will require a little less thought. We're going back to something simple - variables - but a little more in depth.

Think about it - variables store one bit of information. They may regurgitate (just not on the carpet...) that information at any point, and their bit of information can be changed at any time. Variables are great at what they do - storing a piece of information that may change over time.

But what if you need to store a long list of information, which doesn't change over time? Say, for example, the names of the months of the year. Or maybe a long list of information, that does change over time? Say, for example, the names of all your cats. You might get new cats, some may die, some may become your dinner (we should trade recipies!). What about a phone book? For that you need to do a bit of referencing - you would have a list of names, and attached to each of those names, a phone number. How would you do that?

== The Solution - Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries ==

For these three problems, Python uses three different solutions - tuples, lists, and dictionaries:

* '''Lists''' are what they seem - a list of values. Each one of them is numbered, starting from zero - the first one is numbered zero, the second 1, the third 2, etc. You can remove values from the list, and add new values to the end. Example: Your many cats' names.
* '''Tuples''' are just like lists, but you can't change their values. The values that you give it first up, are the values that you are stuck with for the rest of the program. Again, each value is numbered starting from zero, for easy reference. Example: the names of the months of the year.
* '''Dictionaries''' are similar to what their name suggests - a dictionary. In a dictionary, you have an 'index' of words, and for each of them a definition. In Python, the word is called a 'key', and the definition a 'value'. The values in a dictionary aren't numbered - they are similar to what their name suggests - a dictionary. In a dictionary, you have an 'index' of words, and for each of them a definition. In python, the word is called a 'key', and the definition a 'value'. The values in a dictionary aren't numbered - they aren't in any specific order, either - the key does the same thing. You can add, remove, and modify the values in dictionaries. Example: telephone book.

== Tuples ==

Tuples are pretty easy to make. You give your tuple a name, then after that the list of values it will carry. For example, the months of the year:

;Code Example 1 - creating a tuple
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
months = ('January','February','March','April','May','June',\
'July','August','September','October','November','  December')
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the '\' thingy at the end of the first line carries over that line of code to the next line. It is useful way of making big lines more readable.
Technically, you don't have to put those parentheses there (the '(' and ')' thingies), but it stops Python from getting things confused.
You may have spaces after the commas if you feel it necessary - it doesn't really matter.
Python then organises those values in a handy, numbered index - starting from zero, in the order that you entered them in. It would be organised like this:

{| width=25% border=1
  |+ Table 1 - tuple indicies
|-
  ! Index
  ! Value
|-
|0
|January
|-
|1
|February
|-
|2
|March
|-
|3
|April
|-
|4
|May
|-
|5
|June
|-
|6
|July
|-
|7
|August
|-
|8
|September
|-
|9
|October
|-
|10
|November
|-
|11
|December
|}

And that is tuples! Really easy...

== Lists ==

Lists are extremely similar to tuples. Lists are modifiable (or 'mutable', as a programmer may say), so their values can be changed. Most of the time we use lists, not tuples, because we want to easily change the values of things if we need to.

Lists are defined very similarly to tuples. Say you have FIVE cats, called Tom, Snappy, Kitty, Jessie and Chester. To put them in a list, you would do this:

;Code Example 2 - Creating a list
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
cats = ['Tom', 'Snappy', 'Kitty', 'Jessie', 'Chester']
&lt;/source&gt;
As you see, the code is exactly the same as a tuple, EXCEPT that all the values are put between square brackets, not parentheses. Again, you don't have to have spaces after the comma.

You recall values from lists exactly the same as you do with tuples. For example, to print the name of your 3rd cat you would do this:

;Code Example 3 - Recalling items from a list
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print cats[2]
&lt;/source&gt;
You can also recall a range of examples, like above, for example - &lt;code&gt;cats[0:2]&lt;/code&gt; would recall your 1st and 2nd cats.

Where lists come into their own is how they can be modified. To add a value to a list, you use the &lt;code&gt;append()&lt;/code&gt; function. Let's say you got a new cat called Catherine. To add her to the list you'd do this:

;Code Example 4 - Adding items to a list
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
cats.append('Catherine')
&lt;/source&gt;
That's a little weird, isn't it? I'll explain. That function is in a funny spot - after a period (the '.' kind of period, not otherwise), after the list name. You'll get to see those things more in a later lesson. For the meanwhile, this is the form of the function that adds a new value to a list:

;Code Example 5 - Using the append function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#add a new value to the end of a list:
list_name.append(value_to_add)

#e.g. to add the number 5038 to the list 'numbers':
numbers.append(5038)
&lt;/source&gt;
Clears things up? Good!

Now to a sad situation - Snappy was shot by a neighbour, and eaten for their dinner (good on 'em!). You need to remove him (or her) from the list. Removing that sorry cat is an easy task, thankfully, so you have to wallow in sadness for as short a time as possible:

;Code Example 6 - Deleting an item
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Remove your 2nd cat, Snappy. Woe is you.
del cats[1]
&lt;/source&gt;
You've just removed the 2nd cat in your list - poor old Snappy.

And with that morbid message, lets move on to...

== Dictionaries ==

Ok, so there is more to life than the names of your cats. You need to call your sister, mother, son, the fruit man, and anyone else who needs to know that their favourite cat is dead. For that you need a telephone book.

Now, the lists we've used above aren't really suitable for a telephone book. You need to know a number based on someone's name - not the other way around, like what we did with the cats. In the examples of months and cats, we gave the computer a number, and it gave us a name. This time we want to give the computer a name, and it give us a number. For this we need dictionaries.

So how do we make a dictionary? Put away your binding equipment, it isn't that advanced.

Remember, dictionaries have keys, and values. In a phone book, you have people's names, then their numbers. See a similarity?

When you initially create a dictionary, it is very much like making a tuple or list. Tuples have ( and ) things, lists have [ and ] things. Guess what! dictionaries have { and } things - curly braces. Here is an example below, showing a dictionary with four phone numbers in it:

;Code Example 7 - Creating a dictionary
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Make the phone book:
phonebook = {'Andrew Parson':8806336, \
'Emily Everett':6784346, 'Peter Power':7658344, \
'Lewis Lame':1122345}
&lt;/source&gt;
The program would then print Lewis Lame's number onscreen. Notice how instead of identifying the value by a number, like in the cats and months examples, we identify the value, using another value - in this case the person's name.

Ok, you've created a new phone book. Now you want to add new numbers to the book. What do you do? A very simple line of code:

;Code Example 8 - Adding entries to a dictionary
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Add the person 'Gingerbread Man' to the phonebook:

phonebook['Gingerbread Man'] = 1234567

# Didn't think I would give you
# my real number now, would I?
&lt;/source&gt;
All that line is saying is that there is a person called Gingerbread Man in the phone book, and his number is 1234567. In other words - the key is 'Gingerbread Man', and the value is 1234567.

You delete entries in a dictionary just like in a list. Let's say Andrew Parson is your neighbour, and shot your cat. You never want to talk to him again, and therefore don't need his number. Just like in a list, you'd do this:

;Code Example 9 - Removing entries from a dictionary
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
del phonebook['Andrew Parson']
&lt;/source&gt;
Again, very easy. the 'del' operator deletes any function, variable, or entry in a list or dictionary (An entry in a dictionary is just a variable with a number or text string as a name. This comes in handy later on.)

Remember that append function that we used with the list? Well, there are quite a few of those that can be used with dictionaries. Below, I will write you a program, and it will incorporate some of those functions in. It will have comments along the way explaining what it does.

Type this program into Python IDLE (you can skip the comments). Experiment as much as you like with it. Type it where you see the lines beginning with &gt;&gt;&gt;

;Code Example 10 - Functions of dictionaries
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#A few examples of a dictionary

#First we define the dictionary
#it will have nothing in it this time
ages = {}

#Add a couple of names to the dictionary
ages['Sue'] = 23
ages['Peter'] = 19
ages['Andrew'] = 78
ages['Karren'] = 45

#Use the function has_key() - 
#This function takes this form:
#function_name.has_key(key-name)
#It returns TRUE
#if the dictionary has key-name in it
#but returns FALSE if it doesn't.
#Remember - this is how 'if' statements work -
#they run if something is true
#and they don't when something is false.
if ages.has_key('Sue'):
    print &quot;Sue is in the dictionary. She is&quot;, \
ages['Sue'], &quot;years old&quot;

else:
    print &quot;Sue is not in the dictionary&quot;

#Use the function keys() - 
#This function returns a list
#of all the names of the keys.
#E.g.
print &quot;The following people are in the dictionary:&quot;
print ages.keys()

#You could use this function to
#put all the key names in a list:
keys = ages.keys()

#You can also get a list
#of all the values in a dictionary.
#You use the values() function:
print &quot;People are aged the following:&quot;, \
ages.values()

#Put it in a list:
values = ages.values()

#You can sort lists, with the sort() function
#It will sort all values in a list
#alphabetically, numerically, etc...
#You can't sort dictionaries - 
#they are in no particular order
print keys
keys.sort()
print keys

print values
values.sort()
print values

#You can find the number of entries
#with the len() function:
print &quot;The dictionary has&quot;, \
len(ages), &quot;entries in it&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{DISPLAYTITLE:A Beginner's Python Tutorial/&lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; Loop}}
== Introduction ==

Well, in the first lesson about loops, I said I would put off teaching you the for loop, until we had reached lists. Well, here it is!

== The 'for' Loop ==

Basically, the for loop does something for every value in a list. The way it is set out is a little confusing, but otherwise is very basic. Here is an example of it in code:

;Code Example 1 - The for Loop
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Example 'for' loop
# First, create a list to loop through:
newList = [45, 'eat me', 90210, &quot;The day has come, the walrus said, \
to speak of many things&quot;, -67]

# create the loop:
# Goes through newList, and seqentially puts each bit of information
# into the variable value, and runs the loop
for value in newList:
    print value
&lt;/source&gt;
As you see, when the loop executes, it runs through all of the values in the list mentioned after 'in'. It then puts them into value, and executes through the loop, each time with value being worth something different. Let's see it a again, in a classic cheerleading call that we all know:

;Code Example 2 - A for loop example
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# cheerleading program
word = raw_input(&quot;Who do you go for? &quot;)

for letter in word:
    call = &quot;Gimme a &quot; + letter + &quot;!&quot;
    print call
    print letter + &quot;!&quot;

print &quot;What does that spell?&quot;
print word + &quot;!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
A couple of things you've just learnt:

As you see, strings (remember - strings are lines of text) are just lists with lots of characters.
The program went through each of the letters (or values) in word, and it printed them onscreen.
And that is all there is to the for loop.

== Making a Menu Function ==

Now to the business end of the lesson. Lets start writing programs. So far we have learnt variables, lists, loops, and functions. That is pretty much all we need for quite a bit of programming. So let's set ourselves a task.

;Code Example 3 - A menu function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# THE MENU FUNCTION
# The program asks for a string with all the menu options in it,
# and a text string asking a question.
# make sure every menu entry is unique.

def menu(list, question):
    for entry in list:
        print 1 + list.index(entry),
        print &quot;) &quot; + entry

    return input(question) - 1

# def menu(list, question): is telling the function to
# ask for two bits of information:
# A list of all the menu entries,
# and the question it will ask when all the options have been printed

# for entry in list: is pretty much saying;
#'for every entry in the list, do the following:'

# print list.index(entry) + 1 uses the .index() function to find
# where in the list the entry is in. print function then prints it
# it adds 1 to make the numbers more intelligable.

# print &quot;) &quot; + entry prints a bracket, and then the entry name

# after the for loop is finished, input(question) - 1 asks the question,
# and returns the value to the main program (minus 1, to turn it back to
# the number the computer will understand).
&lt;/source&gt;
That wasn't very difficult, was it? the actual program only took up five lines - this is the wonder of how much we have learnt so far! All my comments take up sixteen lines - more than three times the program length. It is a good idea to comment your programs extensively. Remember that if you are going to be publishin gyour code open-source, there are going to be a lot of people checking out the code that you have written. We'll see the function we just wrote in our first example program.

== Our First 'Game' ==

What will our first example program be? How about a (very) simple text adventure game? Sounds like fun! It will only encompass one room of a house, and will be extremely simple. There will be five things, and a door. In one of the five things, is a key to the door. You need to find the key, then open the door. I will give a plain-english version first, then do it in python:

;Code Example 4 - Plain-english version of code
&lt;pre&gt;
#Plain-english version of our 'game'

Tell the computer about our menu function

Print a welcoming message, showing a description of the room.
We will give the player six things to look at: pot plant, painting,\
 vase, lampshade, shoe, and the door

Tell the computer that the door is locked
Tell the computer where the key is

present a menu, telling you what things you can 'operate':
    It will give you the six options
    It will ask the question &quot;what will you look at?&quot;

if the user wanted to look at:
    pot plant:
        If the key is here, give the player the key
        otherwise, tell them it isn't here
    painting:
        same as above
    etc.
    door:
        If the player has the key, let them open the door
        Otherwise, tell them to look harder

Give the player a well done message, for completing the game.
&lt;/pre&gt;
From this, we can write a real program. Ready? Here it is (skip typing the comments):

;Code Example 5 - Text Adventure Game
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#TEXT ADVENTURE GAME

#the menu function:
def menu(list, question):
    for entry in list:
        print 1 + list.index(entry),
        print &quot;) &quot; + entry

    return input(question) - 1

#Give the computer some basic information about the room:
items = [&quot;pot plant&quot;,&quot;painting&quot;,&quot;vase&quot;,&quot;lampshade&quot;,&quot;shoe&quot;,&quot;door&quot;]

#The key is in the vase (or entry number 2 in the list above):
keylocation = 2

#You haven't found the key:
keyfound = 0

loop = 1

#Give some introductary text:
print &quot;Last night you went to sleep in the comfort of your own home.&quot;

print &quot;Now, you find yourself locked in a room. You don't know how&quot;
print &quot;you got there, or what time it is. In the room you can see&quot;
print len(items), &quot;things:&quot;
for x in items:
    print x
print &quot;&quot;
print &quot;The door is locked. Could there be a key somewhere?&quot;
#Get your menu working, and the program running until you find the key:
while loop == 1:
    choice = menu(items,&quot;What do you want to inspect? &quot;)
    if choice == 0:
        if choice == keylocation:
            print &quot;You found a small key in the pot plant.&quot;

            print &quot;&quot;
            keyfound = 1
        else:
            print &quot;You found nothing in the pot plant.&quot;
            print &quot;&quot;
    elif choice == 1:
        if choice == keylocation:
            print &quot;You found a small key behind the painting.&quot;
            print &quot;&quot;

            keyfound = 1
        else:
            print &quot;You found nothing behind the painting.&quot;
            print &quot;&quot;
    elif choice == 2:
        if choice == keylocation:
            print &quot;You found a small key in the vase.&quot;
            print &quot;&quot;
            keyfound = 1
        else:
            print &quot;You found nothing in the vase.&quot;

            print &quot;&quot;
    elif choice == 3:
        if choice == keylocation:
            print &quot;You found a small key in the lampshade.&quot;
            print &quot;&quot;
            keyfound = 1
        else:
            print &quot;You found nothing in the lampshade.&quot;
            print &quot;&quot;

    elif choice == 4:
        if choice == keylocation:
            print &quot;You found a small key in the shoe.&quot;
            print &quot;&quot;
            keyfound = 1
        else:
            print &quot;You found nothing in the shoe.&quot;
            print &quot;&quot;
    elif choice == 5:
        if keyfound == 1:
            loop = 0
            print &quot;You put in the key, turn it, and hear a click&quot;

            print &quot;&quot;
        else:
            print &quot;The door is locked, you need to find a key.&quot;
            print &quot;&quot;

# Remember that a backslash continues
# the code on the next line

print &quot;Light floods into the room as \
you open the door to your freedom.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Well, a very simple, but fun, game. Don't get daunted by the amount of code there, 53 of the lines are just the 'if' statements, which is the easiest thing to read there. (Once you comprehend all the indentation, you'll be able to make your own game, and you can make it as simple [or as complex] as you like.)

== Making the Game Better ==

The first question you should ask is &quot;does this program work?&quot;. The answer here is yes. Then you should ask &quot;does this program work well?&quot; - not quite. The menu() function is great - it reduces a lot of typing. The 'while' loop that we have, however, is a little messy - four levels of indents, for a simple program. We can do better!

Now, this will become much MUCH more straightforward when we introduce classes. But that will have to wait. Until then, let's make a function that reduces our mess. It we will pass two things to it - the menu choice we made, and the location of the key. It will return one thing - whether or not the key has been found. Lets see it:

;Code Example 6 - Creating an inspect function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def inspect(choice,location):
    if choice == location:
        print &quot;&quot;
        print &quot;You found a key!&quot;
        print &quot;&quot;
        return 1
    else:
        print &quot;&quot;
        print &quot;Nothing of interest here.&quot;
        print &quot;&quot;
        return 0
&lt;/source&gt;
Now the main program can be a little simpler. Let's take it from the while loop, and change things around:

;Code Example 7 - The new game
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
while loop == 1:
    keyfound = inspect(menu(items,&quot;What do you want to inspect? &quot;), keylocation)
    if keyfound == 1:
        print &quot;You put the key in the lock of the door, and turn it. It opens!&quot;
        loop = 0

print &quot;Light floods into the room, \
as you open the door to your freedom.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Now the program becomes massively shorter - from a cumbersome 83 lines, to a very shapely 50 lines! Of course, you lose quite a bit of versatility - all the items in the room do the same thing. You automatically open the door when you find the key. The game becomes a little less interesting. It also becomes a little harder to change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

One thing that you will get to know about programming, is that programmers like to be lazy. If something has been done before, why should you do it again?

That is what functions cover in Python. You've already had your code do something special. Now you want to do it again. You put that special code into a function, and re-use it for all it is worth. You can refer to a function anywhere in your code, and the computer will always know what you are talking about. Handy, eh?

Of course, functions have their limitations. Functions don't store any information like variables do - every time a function is run, it starts afresh. However, certain functions and variables are related to each other very closely, and need to interact with each other a lot. For example, imagine you have a golf club. It has information about it (i.e. variables) like the length of the shaft, the material of the grip, and the material of the head. It also has functions associated with it, like the function of swinging your golf club, or the function of breaking it in pure frustration. For those functions, you need to know the variables of the shaft length, head material, etc.

That can easily be worked around with normal functions. Parameters affect the effect of a function. But what if a function needs to affect variables? What happens if each time you use your golf club, the shaft gets weaker, the grip on the handle wears away a little, you get that little more frustrated, and a new scratch is formed on the head of the club? A function cannot do that. A function only makes one output, not four or five, or five hundred. What is needed is a way to group functions and variables that are closely related into one place so that they can interact with each other.

Chances are that you also have more than one golf club. Without classes, you need to write a whole heap of code for each different golf club. This is a pain, seeing that all clubs share common features, it is just that some have changed properties - like what the shaft is made of, and it's weight. The ideal situation would be to have a design of your basic golf club. Each time you create a new club, simply specify its attributes - the length of its shaft, its weight, etc.

Or what if you want a golf club, which has added extra features? Maybe you decide to attach a clock to your golf club (why, I don't know - it was your idea). Does this mean that we have to create this golf club from scratch? We would have to write code first for our basic golf club, plus all of that again, and the code for the clock, for our new design. Wouldn't it be better if we were to just take our existing golf club, and then tack the code for the clock to it?

These problems are what a thing called object-oriented-programming solves. It puts functions and variables together in a way that they can see each other and work together, be replicated, and altered as needed, and not when unneeded. And we use a thing called a 'class' to do this.

== Creating a Class ==

What is a class? Think of a class as a blueprint. It isn't something in itself, it simply describes how to make something. You can create lots of objects from that blueprint - known technically as an instance.

So how do you make these so-called 'classes'? Very easily, with the &lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt; operator:

;Code Example 1 - defining a class
&lt;pre&gt;
# Defining a class
class class_name:
    [statement 1]
    [statement 2]
    [statement 3]
    [etc.]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Makes little sense? Thats okay, here is an example that creates the definition of a Shape:

;Code Example 2 - Example of a Class
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#An example of a class
class Shape:
    def __init__(self,x,y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    description = &quot;This shape has not been described yet&quot;
    author = &quot;Nobody has claimed to make this shape yet&quot;
    def area(self):
        return self.x * self.y
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * self.x + 2 * self.y
    def describe(self,text):
        self.description = text
    def authorName(self,text):
        self.author = text
    def scaleSize(self,scale):
        self.x = self.x * scale
        self.y = self.y * scale
&lt;/source&gt;
What you have created is a description of a shape (That is, the variables) and what operations you can do with the shape (That is, the fuctions). This is very important - you have not made an actual shape, simply the description of what a shape is. The shape has a width (x), a height (y), and an area and perimeter (area(self) and perimeter(self)). No code is run when you define a class - you are simply making functions and variables.

The function called __init__ is run when we create an instance of Shape - that is, when we create an actual shape, as opposed to the 'blueprint' we have here, __init__ is run. You will understand how this works later.

self is how we refer to things in the class from within itself. self is the first parameter in any function defined inside a class. Any function or variable created on the first level of indentation (that is, lines of code that start one TAB to the right of where we put class Shape) is automatically put into self. To access these functions and variables elsewhere inside the class, their name must be preceeded with self and a full-stop (e.g. self.variable_name).

== Using a Class ==

Its all well and good that we can make a class, but how do we use one? Here is an example, of what we call creating an instance of a class. Assume that the code example 2 has already been run:

;Code Example 3 - Creating a class
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
rectangle = Shape(100, 45)
&lt;/source&gt;
What has been done? It takes a little explaining...

The __init__ function really comes into play at this time. We create an instance of a class by first giving its name (in this case, Shape) and then, in brackets, the values to pass to the __init__ function. The init function runs (using the parameters you gave it in brackets) and then spits out an instance of that class, which in this case is assigned to the name rectangle.

Think of our class instance, rectangle, as a self-contained collection of variables and functions. In the same way that we used self to access functions and variables of the class instance from within itself, we use the name that we assigned to it now (rectangle) to access functions and variables of the class instance from outside of itself. Following on from the code we ran above, we would do this:

;Code Example 4 - accessing attributes from outside an instance
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#finding the area of your rectangle:
print rectangle.area()

#finding the perimeter of your rectangle:
print rectangle.perimeter()

#describing the rectangle
rectangle.describe(&quot;A wide rectangle, more than twice\
 as wide as it is tall&quot;)

#making the rectangle 50% smaller
rectangle.scaleSize(0.5)

#re-printing the new area of the rectangle
print rectangle.area()
&lt;/source&gt;
As you see, where self would be used from within the class instance, its assigned name is used when outside the class. We do this to view and change the variables inside the class, and to access the functions that are there.

We aren't limited to a single instance of a class - we could have as many instances as we like. I could do this:

;Code Example 5 - More than one instance
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
long_rectangle = Shape(120,10)
fat_rectangle = Shape(130,120)
&lt;/source&gt;

Both long_rectangle and fat_rectangle have their own functions and variables contained inside them - they are totally independent of each other. There is no limit to the number of instances I could create.

== Lingo ==

Object-oriented programming has a set of lingo that is associated with it. Its about time that we have this all cleared up:

* when we first describe a class, we are defining it (like with functions)
* the ability to group similar functions and variables together is called encapsulation
* the word 'class' can be used when describing the code where the class is defined (like how a function is defined), and it can also refer to an instance of that class - this can get confusing, so make sure you know in which form we are talking about classes
* a variable inside a class is known as an Attribute
* a function inside a class is known as a method
* a class is in the same category of things as variables, lists, dictionaries, etc. That is, they are objects
* a class is known as a 'data structure' - it holds data, and the methods to process that data.

== Inheritance ==

Lets have a look back at the introduction. We know how classes group together variables and functions, known as attributes and methods, so that both the data and the code to process it is in the same spot. We can create any number of instances of that class, so that we don't have to write new code for every new object we create. But what about adding extra features to our golf club design? This is where inheritance comes into play.

Python makes inheritance really easily. We define a new class, based on another, 'parent' class. Our new class brings everything over from the parent, and we can also add other things to it. If any new attributes or methods have the same name as an attribute or method in our parent class, it is used instead of the parent one. Remember the Shape class?

;Code Example 6 - the Shape class
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Shape:
    def __init__(self,x,y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.description = &quot;This shape has not been described yet&quot;
        self.author = &quot;Nobody has claimed to make this shape yet&quot;
    def area(self):
        return self.x * self.y
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * self.x + 2 * self.y
    def describe(self,text):
        self.description = text
    def authorName(self,text):
        self.author = text
    def scaleSize(self,scale):
        self.x = self.x * scale
        self.y = self.y * scale
&lt;/source&gt;
If we wanted to define a new class, let's say a square, based on our previous Shape class, we would do this:

;Code Example 7 - Using inheritance
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self,x):
        self.x = x
	self.y = x
&lt;/source&gt;
It is just like normally defining a class, but this time we put in brackets after the name, the parent class that we inherited from. As you see, we described a square really quickly because of this. That's because we inherited everything from the shape class, and changed only what needed to be changed. In this case we redefined the __init__ function of Shape so that the X and Y values are the same.

Let's take from what we have learnt, and create another new class, this time inherited from Square. It will be two squares, one immediately left of the other:

;Code Example 8 - DoubleSquare class
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# The shape looks like this:
# _________
#|    |    |
#|    |    |
#|____|____|

class DoubleSquare(Square):
    def __init__(self,y):
        self.x = 2 * y
        self.y = y
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * self.x + 2 * self.y
&lt;/source&gt;
This time, we also had to redefine the perimeter function, as there is a line going down the middle of the shape. Try creating an instance of this class. As a helpful hint, the IDLE command line starts where your code ends - so typing a line of code is like adding that line to the end of the program you have written.

== Pointers and Dictionaries of Classes ==

Thinking back, when you say that one variable equals another, e.g. variable2 = variable1, the variable on the left-hand side of the equal-sign takes on the value of the variable on the right. With class instances, this happens a little differently - the name on the left becomes the class instance on the right. So in instance2 = instance1, instance2 is 'pointing' to instance1 - there are two names given to the one class instance, and you can access the class instance via either name.

In other languages, you do things like this using pointers, however in python this all happens behind the scenes.

The final thing that we will cover is dictionaries of classes. Keeping in mind what we have just learnt about pointers, we can assign an instance of a class to an entry in a list or dictionary. This allows for virtually any amount of class instances to exist when our program is run. Lets have a look at the example below, and see how it describes what I am talking about:

;Code Example 9 - Dictionaries of Classes
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Again, assume the definitions on Shape,
# Square and DoubleSquare have been run.
# First, create a dictionary:
dictionary = {}

# Then, create some instances of classes in the dictionary:
dictionary[&quot;DoubleSquare 1&quot;] = DoubleSquare(5)
dictionary[&quot;long rectangle&quot;] = Shape(600,45)

#You can now use them like a normal class:
print dictionary[&quot;long rectangle&quot;].area()

dictionary[&quot;DoubleSquare 1&quot;].authorName(&quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot;)
print dictionary[&quot;DoubleSquare 1&quot;].author
&lt;/source&gt;
As you see, we simply replaced our boring old name on the left-hand side with an exciting, new, dynamic, dictionary entry. Pretty cool, eh?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Last lesson we covered the killer topic of Classes. As you can remember, classes are neat combinations of variables and functions in a nice, neat package. Programming lingo calls this feature encapsulation, but reguardless of what it is called, it's a really cool feature for keeping things together so the code can be used in many instances in lots of places. Of course, you've got to ask, &quot;how do I get my classes to many places, in many programs?&quot;. The answer is to put them into a module, to be imported into other programs.

== Module? What's a Module? ==

A module is a Python file that (generally) has only defenitions of variables, functions, and classes. For example, a module might look like this:

;Code Example 1 - moduletest.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### EXAMPLE PYTHON MODULE
# Define some variables:
numberone = 1
ageofqueen = 78

# define some functions
def printhello():
    print &quot;hello&quot;
    
def timesfour(input):
    print input * 4
    
# define a class
class Piano:
    def __init__(self):
        self.type = raw_input(&quot;What type of piano? &quot;)
        self.height = raw_input(&quot;What height (in feet)? &quot;)
        self.price = raw_input(&quot;How much did it cost? &quot;)
        self.age = raw_input(&quot;How old is it (in years)? &quot;)
	
    def printdetails(self):
        print &quot;This piano is a/an &quot; + self.height + &quot; foot&quot;,
        print self.type, &quot;piano, &quot; + self.age, &quot;years old and costing\
 &quot; + self.price + &quot; dollars.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you see, a module looks pretty much like your normal Python program.

So what do we do with a module? We import bits of it (or all of it) into other programs.

To import all the variables, functions and classes from moduletest.py into another program you are writing, we use the import operator. For example, to import moduletest.py into your main program, you would have this:

;Code Example 2 - mainprogram.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### mainprogam.py
### IMPORTS ANOTHER MODULE
import moduletest
&lt;/source&gt;
This assumes that the module is in the same directory as mainprogram.py, or is a default module that comes with python. You leave out the '.py' at the end of the file - it is ignored. You normally put all import statements at the beginning of the python file, but technically they can be anywhere. In order to use the items in the module in your main program, you use the following:

;Code Example 3 - mainprogram.py continued
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### USING AN IMPORTED MODULE
# Use the form modulename.itemname
# Examples:
print moduletest.ageofqueen
cfcpiano = moduletest.Piano()
cfcpiano.printdetails()
&lt;/source&gt;
As you see, the modules that you import act very much like the classes we looked at last lesson - anything inside them must be preceeded with modulename. for it to work.

== More Module Thingamajigs (in lack of a better title) ==

Wish you could get rid of the modulename. part that you have to put before every item you use from a module? No? Never? Well, I'll teach it you anyway.

One way to avoid this hassle is to import only the wanted objects from the module. To do this, you use the from operator. You use it in the form of from modulename import itemname. Here is an example:

;Code Example 4 - importing individual objects
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### IMPORT ITEMS DIRECTLY INTO YOUR PROGRAM

# import them
from moduletest import ageofqueen
from moduletest import printhello

# now try using them
print ageofqueen
printhello()
&lt;/source&gt;
What is the point of this? Well, maybe you could use it to make your code a little more readable. If we get into heaps of modules inside modules, it could also remove that extra layer of crypticness.

If you wanted to, you could import everything from a module is this way by using from modulename import *. Of course, this can be troublesome if there are objects in your program with the same name as some items in the module. With large modules, this can easily happen, and can cause many a headache. A better way to do this would be to import a module in the normal way (without the from operator) and then assign items to a local name:

;Code Example 5 - mainprogram.py continued
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### ASSIGNING ITEMS TO A LOCAL NAME

# Assigning to a local name
timesfour = moduletest.timesfour

# Using the local name
print timesfour(565)
&lt;/source&gt;
This way, you can remove some crypticness, AND have all of the items from a certain module.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Last lesson we learnt how to load external code into our program. Without any introduction (like what I usually have), let's delve into file input and output with normal text files, and later the saving and restoring of instances of classes. (Wow, our lingo power has improved greatly!)

== Opening a File ==

To open a text file you use, well, the open() function. Seems sensible. You pass certain parameters to open() to tell it in which way the file should be opened - 'r' for read only, 'w' for writing only (if there is an old file, it will be written over), 'a' for appending (adding things on to the end of the file) and 'r+' for both reading and writing. But less talk, lets open a file for reading (you can do this in your python idle mode). Open a normal text file. We will then print out what we read inside the file:

;Code Example 1 - Opening a file
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
openfile = open('pathtofile', 'r')
openfile.read()
&lt;/source&gt;

That was interesting. You'll notice a lot of '\n' symbols. These represent newlines (where you pressed enter to start a new line). The text is completely unformatted, but if you were to pass the output of openfile.read() to print (by typing print openfile.read()) it would be nicely formatted.

== Seek and You Shall Find ==

Did you try typing in print openfile.read()? Did it fail? It likely did, and reason is because the 'cursor' has changed it's place. Cursor? What cursor? Well, a cursor that you really cannot see, but still a cursor. This invisible cursor tells the read function (and many other I/O functions) where to start from. To set where the cursor is, you use the seek() function. It is used in the form seek(offset, whence).

whence is optional, and determines where to seek from. If whence is 0, the bytes/letters are counted from the beginning. If it is 1, the bytes are counted from the current cursor position. If it is 2, then the bytes are counted from the end of the file. If nothing is put there, 0 is assumed.

offset decribes how far from whence that the cursor moves. for example:

openfile.seek(45,0) would move the cursor to 45 bytes/letters after the beginning of the file.
openfile.seek(10,1) would move the cursor to 10 bytes/letters after the current cursor position.
openfile.seek(-77,2) would move the cursor to 77 bytes/letters before the end of the file (notice the - before the 77)
Try it out now. Use openfile.seek() to go to any spot in the file and then try typing print openfile.read(). It will print from the spot you seeked to. But realise that openfile.read() moves the cursor to the end of the file - you will have to seek again.

== Other I/O Functions ==

There are many other functions that help you with dealing with files. They have many uses that empower you to do more, and make the things you can do easier. Let's have a look at tell(), readline(), readlines(), write() and close().

tell() returns where the cursor is in the file. It has no parameters, just type it in (like what the example below will show). This is infinitely useful, for knowing what you are refering to, where it is, and simple control of the cursor. To use it, type fileobjectname.tell() - where fileobjectname is the name of the file object you created when you opened the file (in openfile = open('pathtofile', 'r') the file object name is openfile).

readline() reads from where the cursor is till the end of the line. Remember that the end of the line isn't the edge of your screen - the line ends when you press enter to create a new line. This is useful for things like reading a log of events, or going through something progressively to process it. There are no parameters you have to pass to readline(), though you can optionally tell it the maximum number of bytes/letters to read by putting a number in the brackets. Use it with fileobjectname.readline().

readlines() is much like readline(), however readlines() reads all the lines from the cursor onwards, and returns a list, with each list element holding a line of code. Use it with fileobjectname.readlines(). For example, if you had the text file:

;Code Example 2 - example text file
&lt;pre&gt;
Line 1

Line 3
Line 4

Line 6
&lt;/pre&gt;
The returned list from readlines() would be:

{| width=25% border=1
  |+ Table 1 - resulting list from readlines
|-
  ! Index
  ! Value
|-
|0
|'Line 1'
|-
|1
|''
|-
|2
|'Line 3'
|-
|3
|'Line 4'
|-
|4
|''
|-
|5
|'Line 6'
|}

The write() function, writes to the file. How did you guess? It writes from where the cursor is, and overwrites text in front of it - like in MS Word, where you press 'insert' and it writes over the top of old text. To utilise this most purposeful function, put a string between the brackets to write e.g. fileobjectname.write('this is a string').

close, you may figure, closes the file so that you can no longer read or write to it until you reopen in again. Simple enough. To use, you would write fileobjectname.close(). Simple!

In Python IDLE mode, open up a test file (or create a new one...) and play around with these functions. You can do some simple (and very inconvenient) text editing.

== Mmm, Pickles ==

Pickles, in Python, are to be eaten. Their flavour is just too good to let programmers leave them in the fridge.

Ok, just joking there. Pickles, in Python, are objects saved to a file. An object in this case could be a variables, instance of a class, or a list, dictionary, or tuple. Other things can also be pickled, but with limits. The object can then be restored, or unpickled, later on. In other words, you are 'saving' your objects.

So how do we pickle? With the dump() function, which is inside the pickle module - so at the beginning of your program you will have to write import pickle. Simple enough? Then open an empty file, and use pickle.dump() to drop the object into that file. Let's try that:

;Code Example 3 - pickletest.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### pickletest.py
### PICKLE AN OBJECT

# import the pickle module
import pickle

# lets create something to be pickled
# How about a list?
picklelist = ['one',2,'three','four',5,'can you count?']

# now create a file
# replace filename with the file you want to create
file = open('filename', 'w')

# now let's pickle picklelist
pickle.dump(picklelist,file)

# close the file, and your pickling is complete
file.close()
&lt;/source&gt;
The code to do this is laid out like pickle.load(object_to_pickle, file_object) where:

* object_to_pickle is the object you want to pickle (i.e. save it to file)
* file_object is the file object you want to write to (in this case, the file object is 'file')

After you close the file, open it in notepad and look at what you see. Along with some other gibblygook, you will see bits of the list we created.

Now to re-open, or unpickle, your file. to use this, we would use pickle.load():

;Code Example 4 - unpickletest.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### unpickletest.py
### unpickle file

# import the pickle module
import pickle

# now open a file for reading
# replace filename with the path to the file you created in pickletest.py
unpicklefile = open('filename', 'r')

# now load the list that we pickled into a new object
unpickledlist = pickle.load(unpicklefile)

# close the file, just for safety
unpicklefile.close()

# Try out using the list
for item in unpickledlist:
    print item
&lt;/source&gt;
Nifty, eh?

Of course, the limitation above is that we can only put in one object to a file. We could get around this by putting lots of picklable objects in a list or dictionary, and then pickling that list or dictionary. This is the quickest and easiest way, but you can do some pretty advanced stuff if you have advanced knowledge of pickle.

Which we won't cover.

      <comment>/* Exceptions - Limitations of the Code */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

If you haven't seen them before, you're not trying hard enough. What are they? Errors. Exceptions. Problems. Know what I'm talking about? I got it with this program:

;Code Example 1 - buggy program
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def menu(list, question):
    for entry in list:
        print 1 + list.index(entry),
        print &quot;) &quot; + entry

    return raw_input(question) - 1

# running the function
# remember what the backslash does
answer = menu(['A','B','C','D','E','F','H','I'],\
'Which letter is your favourite? ')

print 'You picked answer ' + (answer + 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This is just an example of the menu program we made earlier. Appears perfectly fine to me. At least until when I first tried it. Run the program, and what happens?

== Bugs - Human Errors ==

The most common problems with your code are of your own doing. Sad, but true. What do we see when we try to run our crippled program?

;Code Example 2 - error message
&lt;pre&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 8, in -toplevel-
    answer = menu(&lt; I'll snip it here &gt;)
  File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 6, in menu
    return raw_input(question) - 1
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'
&lt;/pre&gt;
Say what? What Python is trying to tell you (but struggling to find a good word for it) is that you can't join a string of letters and a number into one string of text. Let's go through the error message and have a look at how it tells us that:

* &lt;code&gt;File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 8, in -toplevel-&lt;/code&gt; tells us a couple of things. File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot; tells us which file the error occured in. This is useful if you use lots of modules that refer to each other. line 8, in -toplevel- tells us that it is in line # 8 of the file, and in the top level (that is, no indentation).
* &lt;code&gt;answer = menu(['A','B','C','D','E','F','H','I'],'Which letter is your favourite? ')&lt;/code&gt; duplicates the code where the error is.
* Since this line calls a function, the next two lines describe where in the function the error occured.
* &lt;code&gt;TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'&lt;/code&gt; tells you the error. In this case, it is a 'TypeError', where you tried to subtract incompatible variables.

There are multiple file and code listings for a single error, because the error occured with the interaction of two lines of code (e.g. when using a function, the error occured on the line where the function was called, AND the line in the function where things went wrong).

Now that we know what the problem is, how do we fix it. Well, the error message has isolated where the problem is, so we'll only concentrate on that bit of code.

;Code Example 3 - calling the menu function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
answer = menu(['A','B','C','D','E','F','H','I'],\
'Which letter is your favourite? ')
&lt;/source&gt;
This is a call to a function. The error occured in the function in the following line

;Code Example 4 - Where it went wrong
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
return raw_input(question) - 1
&lt;/source&gt;
raw_input always returns a string, hence our problem. Let's change it to input(), which, when you type in a number, it returns a number:

;Code Example 5 - Fixing it
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
return input(question) - 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Bug fixed!

== Exceptions - Limitations of the Code ==

Okay, the program works when you do something normal. But what if you try something weird? Type in a letter (lets say, 'm') instead of a number? Whoops!

;Code Example 6 - Another error message
&lt;pre&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 8, in -toplevel-
    answer = menu(&lt; I'll snip it here &gt;)
  File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 6, in menu
    return input(question) - 1
  File &quot;&quot;, line 0, in -toplevel-
NameError: name 'm' is not defined
&lt;/pre&gt;
What is this telling us? There are two code listings - one in line 8, and the other in line 6. What this is telling us is that when we called the menu function in line 8, an error occured in line 6 (where we take away 1). This makes sense if you know what the input() function does - I did a bit of reading and testing, and realised that if you type in a letter or word, it will assume that you are mentioning a variable! so in line 6, we are trying to take 1 away from the variable 'm', which doesn't exist.

Have no clue on how to fix this? One of the best and easiest ways is to use the try and except operators.

Here is an example of try being used in a program:

;Code Example 7 - The try operator
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
try:
    function(world, parameters)
except:
    print world.errormsg
&lt;/source&gt;
This is an example of a really messy bit of code that I was trying to fix. First, the code under try: is run. If there is an error, the compiler jumps to the except section and prints world.errormsg. The program doesn't stop right there and crash, it runs the code under except: then continues on.

Let's try that where the error occured in our code (line 6). The menu function now is:

;Code Example 8 - testing our fix
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def menu(list, question):
    for entry in list:
        print 1 + list.index(entry),
        print &quot;) &quot; + entry
    try:
        return input(question) - 1
    except NameError:
        print &quot;Enter a correct number&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Try entering a letter when you're asked for a number and see what happens. Dang. We fixed one problem, but now it has caused another problem furthur down the track. This happens all the time. (Sometimes you end up going around in circles, because your code is an absolute mess). Let's have a look at the error:

;Code Example 9 - Yet another error message
&lt;pre&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 12, in -toplevel-
    print 'You picked answer', (answer + 1)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'
&lt;/pre&gt;
What has happened this time is that the menu function has returned no value - it only printed an error message. When, at the end of the program, we try to print the returned value plus 1, what is the returned value? There is no returned value? So what is 1 + ... well, we have no clue what we are adding 1 to!

We could just return any old number, but that would be lying. What we really should to is rewrite the program to cope with this exception. With what? try and except!

;Code Example 10 - yet another solution
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# from when we finish defining the function
answer = menu(['A','B','C','D','E','F','H','I'],\
'Which letter is your favourite? ')
try:
    print 'You picked answer', (answer + 1)
    # you can put stuff after a comma in the 'print' statement,
    # and it will continue as if you had typed in 'print' again
except:
    print '\nincorrect answer.'
    # the '\n' is for formatting reasons. Try without it and see.
&lt;/source&gt;
Problem solved again.

== Endless Errors ==

The approach that we used above is not recomended. Why? Because apart from the error that we know can happen, except: catches every other error too. What if this means we never see an error that could cause problems down the track? If except: catches every error under the sun, we have no hope of controlling what errors we deal with, and the other ones that we want to see, because so far we haven't dealt with them. We also have little hope of dealing with more than one type of error in the same block of code. What should one do, when all is hopeless? Here is an example of code with such a situation:

;Code Example 11 - The Problem We Face
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 'Subtraction program, v0.0.1 (beta)'
a = input('Enter a number to subtract from &gt; ')
b = input('Enter the number to subtract &gt; ')
print a - b
&lt;/source&gt;
Okay, you enter your two numbers and it works. Enter a letter, and it gives you a NameError. Lets rewrite the code to deal with a NameError only. We'll put the program in a loop, so it restarts if an error occurs (using continue, which starts the loop from the top again, and break, which leaves the loop):

;Code Example 12 - Dealing With NameError
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 'Subtraction program, v0.0.2 (beta)'
loop = 1
while loop == 1:
    try:
        a = input('Enter a number to subtract from &gt; ')
        b = input('Enter the number to subtract &gt; ')
    except NameError:
        print &quot;\nYou cannot subtract a letter&quot;
    continue
    print a - b
    try:
        loop = input('Press 1 to try again &gt; ')
    except NameError:
        loop = 0
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, we restarted the loop if you typed in something wrong. In line 12 we assumed you wanted to quit the program if you didn't press 1, so we quit the program.

But there are still problems. If we leave something blank, or type in an unusual character like ! or ;, the program gives us a SyntaxError. Lets deal with this. When we are asking for the numbers to subtract, we will give a different error message. When we ask to press 1, we will again assume the user wants to quit.

;Code Example 13 - Now, dealing with SyntaxError
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 'Subtraction program, v0.0.3 (beta)'
loop = 1
while loop == 1:
    try:
        a = input('Enter a number to subtract from &gt; ')
        b = input('Enter the number to subtract &gt; ')
    except NameError:
        print &quot;\nYou cannot subtract a letter&quot;
	continue
    except SyntaxError:
        print &quot;\nPlease enter a number only.&quot;
	continue
    print a - b
    try:
        loop = input('Press 1 to try again &gt; ')
    except (NameError,SyntaxError):
        loop = 0
&lt;/source&gt;
As you can see, you can have multiple except uses, each dealing with a different problem. You can also have one except to deal with multiple exceptions, by putting them inside parentheses and seperating them with commas.

Now we have a program that is very difficult, to crash by an end user. As a final challenge, see if you can crash it. There is one way I have thought of - if you read the section on human error carefully, you might know what it is.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Testing ==

First, let us try a naked pre block:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[1,2,3,4]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

And a naked parser function:

{{#tag:pre|[[1,2,3,4]]}}

Then, surrounding pre it with a body note:

{{body note|1=&lt;pre&gt;
[[1,2,3,4]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

Next, HaskellGHCi

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
[[1,2,3,4]]
}}

Finally, HaskellGHCiExample

{{HaskellGHCiExample|1=A list with a single list|2=
[[1,2,3,4]]
}}

...what about a bare Exercises?

{{Exercises|
&lt;pre&gt;[[1,2,3,4]]&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;code&gt;[[1,2,3,4]]&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;[1,2,3, 4]&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;[[1,2,3,[]]]&lt;/code&gt;
}}

The left and right unit laws of monads are in analogy to the laws for the neutral element of a monoid.

      <comment>/* Activity bias Example */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Activity bias is when an individual, given the choice of taking action or doing nothing, chooses to take action. People want to do something rather than do nothing. Their choice to take action may result in a less-than-optimal decision being made, but they feel that taking action is what they are supposed to do. Activity bias is sometimes referred to as the active participation hypothesis. 

==Background==
Activity bias is often used to explain errors in experimental economics. Experimental economics is the use of experimental methods in order to study questions of economics. Activity bias is present in experimental economics because some experiments may be accidentally worded in such a way or designed to encourage stupid behavior. For example, if a subject is given the choice to participate in a study or not, they might feel like they are supposed to; that they weren’t recruited for the study to do nothing.

==Activity Bias in Experimental Asset Markets==
	One market games experiment was conducted by Vivian Lei, Charles Noussair, and Charles Plott in which there were three sections: Nospec, Twomarket, and Twomarket/Nospec. In the experiment, there were markets set up for assets with a finite number of periods. The asset then paid an allotment in each period, and that allotment was the only source of central value. This allotment is identical for each trader/subject in the experiment and the process is common knowledge to all traders/subjects.  The study found that errors in decision making were resultant of activity bias.
  
===The Asset Market Experiment===
In the Nospec section, the markets are constructed similar to markets that have had bubbles and crashes. For the subject, the ability to speculate is removed and their role is either a buyer or seller so that there is no purpose to buy for the reason of resale. The only possible benefit from a purchase in this experiment is in the allotment that the asset pays out, since the unit can never be resold. In the Twomarket experiment, there is another market that operates simultaneously to the asset market. This asset market allows buying for resale and the market follows a boom and crash pattern. The directions were labeled as such to prevent bias toward inaction or action: “you are not required to participate in either of the markets if you choose not to. It may be to your advantage not to participate in either or it may be to your advantage to participate in one or both. You should decide what might be in your best interest and make your choice accordingly &lt;ref name=Vivian&gt;{{Citation| author = Vivian Lei|author2 = Charles N. Noussair|author3 = Charles R. Plott|title = Nonspeculative Bubbles in Experimental Asset Markets: Lack of Common Knowledge or Rationality vs. Actual Irrationality|year = 2001|type = journal Economica}}&lt;/ref&gt;.” In the Twomarket/Nospec section, there are two markets that are exactly the same as in the Twomarket section, but the option of buying for resale in the asset market is not available. 

	
Even with the directions not indicating a bias towards inaction or action, the subject may still feel as if they are supposed to buy and sell in the markets because they are placed into the market environment with the role of a trader &lt;ref name=Vivian/&gt;. Given this role, the subject may believe that buying and selling is one of the objectives of the experiment. Believing this notion, if the subject was given the choice between an unprofitable transaction and not trading, the subject will choose the unprofitable transaction. This is a speculated reason why so much trading activity occurs and the pattern of stock markets suggests such behavior occurs. In order for activity bias to be present in this study, the volume of trade must decline in the asset market in the Twomarket and Twomarket/Nospec sections relative to the standard experiments in which the asset market is the only market operating.

===Results===	
The Results that Vivian Lei, Charles Noussair, and Charles Plott found indicated that activity bias was present because both the addition of a second market and the changes in the instructions saying that participation was optional “drastically reduced participation in asset market &lt;ref name=Vivian/&gt;.” Activity bias in this experiment explained the large observed transaction volumes in the Nospec section; these transaction volumes were errors in decision-making. The error was believing that one had to buy and sell. The Twomarket and Twomarket/Nospec sections were designed to try to reduce the level of activity bias by stating that participation was optional.

==Activity Bias in Extensive Form Games==
A coordination games experiment was researched by Evren Atiker, William S. Neilson, and Michael K. Price in which they studied the effect of activity bias and focal points in a basic centipede game. &quot;The centipede game itself consists of alternating play of binary choices, with each player making the decision to end the game or continue.  Continuing the game increases the total payoff to the two players, but switches  who receives the larger payoff &lt;ref name = Evren&gt;{{Citation|author = Evren Atiker| author2 = William S. Neilson|author3 = Michael K. Price|title = Activity Bias and Focal Points in Extensive Form Games|year = 2011|type = document|url = http://www.eea-esem.com/files/papers/EEA-ESEM/2011/790/Centipede%20Oslo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; But, if player A chose to continue and Player B did not at the next node, Player A's payoff would be lower than if A ended the game at the previous node. A single subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) strategy combination is returned from this payoff format &lt;ref name=Evren/&gt;. The effect in this equilibrium has whatever player who is the first mover ending the game at the very first node. The experiment found that activity bias was a contributing explanation for why the subjects failed to play SPE in the games.

===Basis of the Experiment===
The experiment used the centipede game as the basis and changed it by removing a certain confusing element and and observing how it affects the game play. Changes made are small such as to make minor or no changes in strategy space, no changes in length of the game, and with one exception, to make no changes in the equilibrium path. There were four different approaches that the experiment had. The first approach held constant the joint payoff at all the decision nodes; it was the standard game but without growth in the payoff nodes. The second approach added a pair of nodes to the beginning of the game and continuing the game from this point increased both individual payoffs and joint payoffs. The third approach removed the final two nodes of the game and created a new pair of nodes. This new pair of nodes provided one player with an extremely large payoff while the other player would receive a smaller (and sometimes negative) payoff. The player who receives the larger payoff can only receive this if their opponent ends the game; this is to see the deviations from the SPE play reflect the beliefs about rationality. The fourth and final approach doesn't allow Player B to participate, the outcome of which Player A might be averse to. This approach does provide Player B with a trivial choice if Player A chooses to end the game at the first node &lt;ref name=Evren/&gt;. 

===Hypothesis of the experiment===
The experiment states several hypothesis of what should happen in the game. Hypothesis three predicts that there should be no difference in the frequency of the SPE across the games for Player B in the fourth approach. The frequency of A should be grater in these games than in the games at the beginning of the experiment (standard game). This would be consistent with the explanation of activity bias and one-sided errors, but inconsistent with the prediction that players have a preference for actions that will allow their opponents to have at least one move &lt;ref name=Evren/&gt;.

===Results===
The results of the experiment found that activity bias is a contributing explanation for why the subjects failed to play the SPE in the games. Both players ended up increasing their frequency in which they play dow at the predicted node; it wasn't just Player A.

==Activity Bias and Online Advertising==
An experiment to test advertising effectiveness also tested activity bias and was conducted by the company Yahoo!. The research team wanted to find out if activity bias was the &quot;source of overestimation in observational estimates of the effects of online advertising &lt;ref name = Randall&gt;{{Citation|author = Randall A. Lewis|author2 = Justin M. Rao|author3 = David H. Reiley|title = Here, There, and Everywhere: Correlated Online Behaviors Can Lead to Overestimates of the Effects in Advertising|year = 2011|url = http://www.nber.org/conf_papers/f56911/f56911.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; Because clicks on advertisements are easy to measure, online advertising generated a way to study the effects of advertising. There are two assumptions made: 1) if two people, A and B, looked at the exact advertisement yesterday, and only A is exposed today, then person B would be a good control to use for what would have happened to the exposed individual and 2) a person's behavior yesterday is a good indication of what they would likely do today&lt;ref name = Randall/&gt;. But these assumptions fail to hold for advertising because browsing activity brings exposure to an ad campaign, making other users who saw the ad to be more active on the publisher's site during that time; different users' browsing behavior depict a large difference over time, meaning people browse a different amount of pages every day; and user's browsing behavior across the different websites appear to be positively related meaning someone who browses one website more than usual on a certain day is more likely to be viewing other sites more than usual. These three reasons combine to form the basis of activity bias; in online advertising, activity bias is the &quot;tendency to overestimate the causal effects of advertising using online data &lt;ref name = Randall/&gt;.&quot; Users browsing activity is not consistent over time and, as a result, creates a non-causal correlation between viewing the ads and purchases.

==Activity bias Example==
Suppose an amusement park wanted to estimate the effect of a billboard they put up along the highway would have. The company that owns the park cannot simply compare drivers who saw the ad to drivers who didn't because there are differences in the drivers. For example, drivers who did not see the billboard could be due to that they live on the other side of town. To compensate for this, the company would receive a list of drivers who travel along the highway on their morning commute. If the billboard runs for 2 weeks, then the firm would survey drivers to determine their exposure and what products they used during the 2 week period. Their study finds that the exposed drivers were more likely to come to their park with their families in the 2 week period and the week after that compared to drivers who only saw the ad once or didn't see it at all. Activity bias says the reason for the increased bias is because the drivers were more active in shopping during this period compared to the unexposed drivers. The drivers who were listed as morning commuters on that route, but didn't show up as much during this time may be because of a part-time job, they were sick or out of town, etc. It is likely the ad had a positive effect, but to reach a clear, concise conclusion that the ad was the sole reason is impossible. If that data were on hand, the amusement park company could have found there was an increase in speeding tickets &quot;caused&quot; by the billboard as well.

      <comment>Added some information regarding the effect of lockouts on the Public Sphere, and how it connects to the idea of Habermas and checks &amp; balances.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===Introduction===
Sports and their role in American society has become increasingly controversial with the ballooning salaries of players and the exponential growth of television network contracts.  Take Albert Pujols’ new $254 million/10 year contract with the Angels, or the team’s new $3 billion television agreement with Fox Sports West as examples of unnecessary spending in sports (ESPN).  Neil Postman, a media theorist and author of ''Amusing Ourselves to Death'', would consider sports to be nothing but a distraction that merely entertains and cannot inform or unite.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. ''Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business''. New York: Penguin, 1986. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; But naysayers, like Postman, often overlook the positive impact that sports have had on society.  Look no further than September 21st, 2001, when the Mets restarted the baseball season by playing the first game since the league suspended play after the World Trade Center collapse.  Or the New Orleans Saints who won the 2009 Super Bowl, and returned normalcy to a city, and stadium, rocked by Hurricane Katrina just a few years before.  I consider sports to be the world’s rawest reality show which lets fans connect with a team or player in ways that they can’t with political parties or movie stars.  We live and die with our team’s success and it’s this connection that makes sports a vital piece in the public sphere.

====The Mets and 9/11====
September 11th, 2001, is forever a day of infamy in American history.  It seemed like the entire nation was frozen for a week, in awe and disbelief of what just happened and for ten days, the professional baseball season was put on hold by commissioner Bud Selig.  The New York Mets would have the honor of re-opening the 2001 season by hosting their bitter rival Atlanta Braves on the 21st of September.  Johnny Franco, closer for the Mets at the time, said it best: “Nobody knew what the right time was, or if it was the right time to come back&quot; (MLB.com).  The Mets took the field donning FDNY caps and patches. The opening ceremonies were touching, and chants of “U-S-A” could be heard from the stands.  However, fans at the game described the moment as confusing.  They felt odd cheering and giving their all for something as meaningless as a baseball game, after something so much bigger had just shook America.  Yet, as the soon-to-be-hero Mike Piazza, later stated, there was something necessary about it:  “People wanted to find refuge in baseball: in a crowd and around other people&quot; (MLB.com).
	In the 8th inning of a 2-1 game, Mike Piazza stepped up to the plate with a runner on first and one out with a chance to reclaim the lead.  With one swing of the bat, Piazza was about to send Shea Stadium into a state of frenzy.  Down 0-1 in the count, Piazza swung at a low fastball and belted it out of the park to left center, forever changing baseball history.  The stadium erupted, and fans suddenly felt comfortable cheering.  For the first time in ten days, New Yorkers had something to jump with joy about.  It was as if Piazza’s homerun snapped New York out of its misery and returned it to a state of belief.  Everything felt right, and hundreds of children who had lost parents and relatives to the attacks could laugh and scream with excitement.  The game was something out of a Hollywood script, but so much better because it was real and tangible.
	  No words of a politician, or declarations of war would fix the immediate pain felt by individuals touched by 9/11, but the Mets could.  It’s amazing to think that one swing of a bat could pump life into a city that seemed dead just days before.  Mets announcer Howie Rose put it simply: “Shea Stadium has something to smile about.”  The building was waiting to explode all night, and they finally got their chance.  To have strangers on your right and left high five you and hug you and jump with you was the medicine needed to bring comfort to New York.  It gave business men something positive to talk about at the water cooler the next day, and it provided a moment that every person watching could reflect on and draw inspiration from.

====The Saints and Hurricane Katrina====
In 2005, Hurricane Katrina, a category five hurricane, rocked New Orleans and sent the city into chaos.  Over 1,800 people were killed, and total property damage reached over $81 billion.  So many places had been destroyed that people began seeking refuge in the Superdome, the stadium and home of the Saints football team.  Images of citizens standing on their roofs screaming at military helicopters for help still plays in the minds of many Americans.  President Bush’s embarrassing attempts at rescue only infuriated the city and drove them to extreme limits.  In fact, Martial Law, a law stating that military force can be used on Americans, was about five minutes from being enacted, a situation that would have forever changed history.  Luckily, the law was not put into effect and slowly, the city began to heal, yet again with the help of sports.
	In 2006, the Superdome was cleared out and given back to the New Orleans Saints.  They reopened their stadium on Monday Night Football against Michael Vick and the Atlanta Falcons and a storybook three years was about to unfold.  The sellout crowd packed the stadium and waved signs reading “Welcome Home Saints” and “Dome Sweet Dome.”  After the Saints' defense forced a three and out on the first drive, the Falcons' special teams unit came out to punt the ball from around their own 30 yard line.  Steve Gleason broke through the line and blocked Atlanta’s punt backwards; it was recovered by Curtis Deloatch who took several steps and dove clumsily into the end zone, which set the tone for the next few years.
	What was an abysmal team for years prior suddenly harnessed the angst and emotion of their city, put the people on their backs and carried them to happiness.  For three years, the Saints scratched and clawed their way to better and better records, taking the pain and frustration of the city and using it as fuel for motivation to continue to grow as a team.  It was a two-way connection between team and fans.  The team drove the fans to keep fighting for their normalcy at home, while the fans drove the team to fight for wins on the field.  Having something to look forward to each Sunday gave those who lost everything a chance to gain something once a week.     
	When President Bush’s words couldn’t revive the city, the Saints did.  Once again, political rhetoric wasn’t believable; it wasn’t tangible.  Football games were more than entertainment; they were weekly doses of medicine prescribed to return joy and comfort.  Our political system made horrendous efforts to help the people of New Orleans.  They needed something local to come together around because Washington wasn’t providing that stability.

===Sports as a Means of Getting an Education===
As Al Gore stated in his book, The Assault on Reason, “In an age where education has more economic value than ever before, it is obvious that education should have a higher national priority. It is also clear that democracies are more likely to succeed when there is wide-spread access to high-quality education”. &lt;ref&gt;Gore, Al. The Assault on Reason. London: Penguin, 2007. 250. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is clear that proper education is important, it is not necessarily easy for youth, especially those in at-risk areas, to have access to proper education. There are, however, many ways in which athletics can provide opportunities to kids and teens that otherwise would not have access to proper educational tools. Thanks to these opportunities, our citizenry can become more adequately informed and the Public Sphere benefits, as well.
====The Tiger Woods Foundation====
Back in 1996, Tiger Woods and his father, Earl, set up an organization to provide educational resources to students that would help streamline them into colleges across the country. The Tiger Woods Foundation has a campus in Southern California, two campuses in Washington D.C., and have recently announced that another location will be opening up in Philadelphia. At these campuses, students are provided with a great amount of technology and learning tools that give them a hands-on learning experience that is difficult for them to obtain in the inner-city public school system.

[[File:Tiger Woods in 2009.jpg|thumb|Tiger Woods uses his celebrity appeal to attract youth towards education]]

After the death of his father in 2006, Tiger Woods dedicated the Earl Woods Scholarship in his memory. This scholarship is given to the most deserving students involved in the TWF and provide them with thousands of dollars every year to help pay for their college education. In addition, the TWF also provides these scholars with a mentor and specialized internships that prepare them for life after they graduate college. Not only does this scholarship program provide urban youth with a means of continuing their education and help jump-start their careers, but, given the selectivity of the program (dozens of scholarships for thousands of students) the competition motivates the students to be their best and learn as much as they can. Because of this, even if they miss the cut and don’t win a scholarship, they have hopefully learned a lot in the program and will be able to leave the program with a quality education – perhaps even continue their education on their own.

By setting up these campuses in big cities like Anaheim, Washington, and Philadelphia, the TWF has reached out to thousands of youth that otherwise would not have access to high-quality educational tools such as those the program provides. Thanks to these tools and the Earl Woods Scholarship program, urban youth become more educated citizens and will eventually be able to give back to their communities in similar ways, creating a cycle that, hopefully, will break the barriers preventing urban youth from having access to proper education. It is a prime example of how professional athletics can reach youth in ways that traditional educational systems simply cannot match.

====High School Athletes Escaping Bad Situations====
Compton, California is one of, if not, the most dangerous cities in America. Once referred to as the murder capital of the US, young teens have little hope of ever leaving the gang-ridden city, let alone making it past their teen years alive. College recruiters, however, flock to Compton on a yearly basis to scout the talent, particularly for football and basketball. Athletics are one of the only ways for young people to get out of their dangerous living situations.

In 2011, CBS News and Sports Illustrated Magazine joined forces and followed a high school athlete named Kitam Hamm Jr. and showcased how his parents, once linked to the Crips gang, taught him how to survive in Compton. Hamm had a GPA of 3.8, but because of the reputation of Compton, very few schools had interest in his academic prowess. What stood out to the top universities, however, was his tremendous football talent.

Schools from all over the country, including Ivy League institutions, were constantly in touch with young Hamm, as college recruiters usually are, and they all took great interest in his life and safety. At his high school, his teachers and coaches took special interest in Hamm because they knew that he had a ticket out of that horrible place and wanted to see him take it.
To some, the vulture-like tendencies of college recruiters can be a turn off and will say that they don’t care about the student, only the athlete. But, regardless of their intentions, these recruiters have given Hamm a way to get out – a way to survive. 

As with the case with all athletes in inner cities, simply participating in sports helps student-athletes from staying out of trouble. “Football practice occupies the biggest chunk of Hamm's school day. That's by design. The time between school letting out and nightfall is when boys in Compton get into trouble. Football provides an alternative.” &lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Jeff. &quot;Straight Outta Compton.&quot; top student and football star in South Central L.A., Kitam Hamm is one of a growing number of high school athletes who face life-and-death decisions every day as they try to survive in gang-infested communities. 5 Dec 2011: n. page. Web. 26 Apr. 2013. &lt;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1192636/1/index.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
By keeping these at-risk teens busy, it keeps them away from the gangs, away from crime, away from police. The structure and discipline sport provides helps them become better role models for their fellow citizens. It helps the community rally around something healthy, collectively. While this may be more difficult in inner cities, it gives some in the community something to be proud of: seeing Hamm, who has been through what they’re going through, “make it” into a better place in the world.
[[File:Compton High School billboard.jpg|thumb|High School is the only safe haven for many athletes in dangerous neighborhoods]]
Given his academic abilities, regardless of whether football pans out as a career, Hamm has the ability to go on to contribute great things to society and reach out to others in his situation. At the time of the article’s publication, Hamm indicated that he would like to attend Columbia University; a prestigious school built on academic success. Thanks to football, Hamm and countless others have been given the tools to succeed in life and make a better society.

====How it all Connects====
Jürgen Habermas and other scholars of the Public Sphere list sport as a distraction from “important” issues in the world such as politics and the economy. In some ways, they are right, although I believe that sport is intended to be a distraction; a way to help people get through the hardships of daily life. However, what they fail to account for is how the economic and popular force that is sport and how it can influence an entire culture and an entire nation.

During the recent National Basketball Association (NBA) lockout, there were dozens of local businesses in small-market NBA host cities (Cleveland, Portland, Oklahoma City, etc.) that were forced to go out of business because the games no longer attracted fans to their stores/restaurants near the stadium. Places that would normally be packed with crazed fans before and after basketball games were barren. Even the arenas had to layoff employees because there was no money coming in from games anymore. Sports provided these cities with business, prosperity, and culture. In order to have a healthy Public Sphere, it is important for the citizenry to not only feel pride for their home, but also have a sense of comradery with their fellow citizens so that difficult problems might be solved more easily. A group is more likely to reach consensus when they like each other rather than hate each other.

Education is the bloodstream of the Public Sphere. Without it, society would become decultured and mankind would slip into a radical state. It is important that every citizen be provided the tools necessary to make that education happen. While that task is nearly impossible to accomplish, sport plays but a small role in that education. An athlete doesn’t have to “go pro” in order for their years of dedication to mean something. In the case of Kitam Hamm Jr., sports provided him with a path towards the highest education in the country in the Ivy League, the moral structure and fortitude that should be sought in all citizens, and even helped him stay alive past the age of 18.

In the case of the Tiger Woods Foundation, urban youth become interested in education in ways that public schools only dream of doing. Putting a famous name and face like that of a professional athlete’s draws in a demographic that otherwise would find education to be boring and pointless. 

Also, it is important that those who succeed through these programs continue to pass on their learning and connections with others that are in similar situations to those that they were in. For Kitam, that mentor role was filled by Greg Camarillo, a wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings that met Kitam through his inner city program and has helped guide him in his life ever since.
Kids need a chance and sports give them that chance. It is a small role, to be sure, but to those who are lucky enough to get those opportunities, the world is opened up to them. Like Al Gore said, “…democracies are more likely to succeed when there is wide-spread access to high-quality education”.

===Effects of Lockouts on the Public Sphere===
While Jürgen Habermas and other influential figures of the Public Sphere say that sports are merely a distraction, it is quite apparent that people connect with sports in ways that cannot be done otherwise. Sports play a tremendous roll in the education of students, helping develop young minds into mature, goal-driven contributors to society. Sports may not be out of a textbook, but lessons can always be learned. Professional sports are entertaining for viewers and still provide lessons for the younger fans, such as how to interact with players from the other team and respecting your coach. Children understand sports and always have a favorite athlete; someone they want to be when they grow up. Professional athletes serve as mentors, even though they may never come in direct contact with their biggest fans.

Being a professional at anything, whether it be in medicine, dentistry, or sports, comes with a responsibility. Professionals are expected to act as exemplary members of society. Recently there have been some rather serious disturbances to that image. Since the turn of the millennium, there have been five lockouts in professional sports. There were two in the NHL, two in the NFL (a player lockout and a referee lockout), and one in the NBA. While these lockouts certainly frustrate everyone immediately involved, it also disrupts the Public Sphere outside of the sport itself.

====NHL Lockout====
The first of two NHL Lockouts would occur during the 2004-2005 hockey season. It was the second lockout since Commissioner Gary Bettman took the reigns, and it would cripple the league’s image. Before the season even began, team owners were demanding a salary cap of $35 million and a plan to give players a 50/50 cut on league revenue. &lt;ref&gt;Dater, Adrian. &quot;NHL lockout timeline: comparing 2004-05 to 2012-13.&quot; As the calendar nears the Sept, 15 expiration of the NHL's Collective Bargaining Agreement, it's starting to look, sound and feel a lot like the dark fall of 2004. 29 August 2012: page 1. Web. 24 April 2013. &lt;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/adrian_dater/08/23/nhl-lockout-timeline/index.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations were on-and-off until Bettman finally decided to cancel what was left of the already-reduced schedule. An entire season of hockey was being cut from the calendar, and there were talks of the following season being cancelled as well.

While the financial aspects of the lockout between players and owners seems insane for most people, the financial impact on the immediate areas surrounding hockey rinks was apparent. Areas such as Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Boston witnessed small businesses having to close shop. This was a direct result of the lockout because without the hockey season, some small shops could not afford to stay open. Their revenue came from tourists and fans, and without hockey there was a serious decrease in both. Shops that sold memorabilia and replica uniforms struggled without the influx of money from fans. While millionaires squabbled over dimes and nickels, people who paid attention to hockey saw a change in the sport’s image in the Public Sphere.

====NBA Lockout====
Before the start of the 2011 NBA season, Commissioner David Stern announced that the league would be locked out. There had been talks of such an event for months, but people held out hope that the issue would be resolved without having a second sports lockout in the same year (the NFL had held a brief lockout just months before). However, there would be immediate groans of disbelief and resentment as the NBA locked out its players. It would be yet another argument over money, and “it was extremely difficult for most NBA fans to sympathize with millionaires and billionaires arguing over money.”&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Alana. &quot;Why The NBA Lockout Wasn't So Bad After All.&quot; We can all agree that the NBA Lockout didn’t shed the greatest light on professional basketball. 2 December 2011: page 1. Web. 25 April 2013. &lt;http://www.forbes.com/sites/sportsmoney/2011/12/02/why-the-nba-lockout-wasnt-so-bad-after-all/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the NBA was able to salvage its season and play a condensed schedule of only 66 games (instead of the normal 82), its image in the Public Sphere had been badly wounded. In similar fashion to the 2004-05 NHL Lockout, small businesses around the basketball arenas were immediately and harshly impacted by the lack of tourism and fans. 

====NFL Lockout====
The fan base of the NFL was aware of the oncoming lockout as early as April of 2011, and it was ready to accept its arrival. It wasn’t that people would not fight it, but that people believed it could be ended quickly. Fans were okay with a low profile draft and a quiet offseason, but that was all in the anticipation of a quick solution between the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) and the owners.&lt;ref&gt;Toback, Shaun. &quot;NFL Lockout 2011: How the NFL Is Shooting Itself in the Foot.&quot; Early April is a boring time to be an NFL fan. 1 April 2011. Web. 24 April 2013. &lt;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/651542-lockout-2011-how-the-nfl-is-shooting-itself-in-the-foot&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the NFL Lockout would not be solved as quickly as fans had hoped. Just like the NBA players and owners would do later that same year, NFL players and owners argued over millions of dollars. Again, merchandise sales plummeted and, just like their NHL and NBA counterparts, NFL fans started turning their backs. While the millionaires dispute over money, they forget about the people who essentially paid them. Without the fans, many owners and players would not be as rich as they are today. The NFL Lockout was another victim of the Public Sphere in sports, and those within the league had only themselves to blame.
 
Back in 1994, Major League Baseball (the MLB) encountered its own player strike. Prior to its occurrence, owners had seen the sport’s popularity as a chance to cash in and get rich; what they forgot to do was keep fighting for the sport. When the MLB’s elite kicked back and allowed everything to go up in flames, the fans were all but forgotten. Fans were not too displeased initially, but with the cancellation of the 1994 World Series, everything changed. Baseball had been enjoying the peak of its popularity, and in an instant it was gone. Baseball fans don’t see the World Series as just a championship, but as an entirely different season. 

Jump forward to the NFL Lockout in 2011 and the same attitude can be seen amongst the fans. People didn’t mind the loss of preseason games; those hardly counted for anything more than a scrimmage. What people worried about was the loss of an entire season. With the NFL’s level of popularity, especially in recent years, a cancelled season could have ended the league. While the 2011 NFL schedule would proceed almost without interruption, minus the preseason games, it left a scar on the NFL. Once again, due to the greediness of millionaires, the Public Sphere was affected by the flow of money and not by the sport.

====How the Lockouts all Connect in the Public Sphere====
Jürgen Habermas may believe that sports are a distraction in the Public Sphere, but in the U.S. everything runs on money. That’s just the way capitalism works. Without a profit it is hard to succeed. Based on that fact alone, it is not far-fetched to say that sports are not actually the distraction anymore, if they ever were. Instead, the distractions stem from the disruption of comfort. People feel comfortable when they are watching sports and enjoy themselves. When that is taken from them, they lose a contributing factor to their pursuit of happiness. The Public Sphere is affected more by the flow of money than the act of watching a sporting event.

What these lockouts all have in common is that too much power was put in the hands of too few people. Due to the very fact that capitalism is a democratic idea, one could argue that the Constitutional rules should still apply when it comes to making decisions. As Al Gore states in his book, The Assault on Reason:
	
&lt;center&gt;The “auxiliary precautions” [James Madison] had in mind were the checks and balances that our Founders used in their design of the Constitution in order to prevent the unhealthy concentration of too much power in the hands of a few—and thereby to force those in authority to justify their views to one another by applying the rule of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Gore, Al. The Assault on Reason. London: Penguin, 2007. 216. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

Not enough people had a say in any of the lockouts. Players took to Twitter, Facebook, and other media outlets to vent their frustration, but nothing they said would be heard by those in power. Only a handful of star players ever have the ability to influence such an issue, but even then the stars’ requests and ideas can fall on deaf ears. The only thing players could do was wait it out and find another way to kill time. In the NBA, for example, a number of players left to play in other leagues around the world. To these players it was more about being able to play than about making an extra couple million dollars. 

The lockouts always cast a shadow over the affected sport because of how the incident looks in the Public Sphere. No one will sympathize with rich men trying to make more money than they can handle, and as a result the fan bases can shrink or even disappear. Sports can be entertaining, but they become a distraction when money is an issue. Of course, that’s the nature of capitalism, but democracy does not exist behind the closed doors of those lockouts.

== Ocaml-glpk ==
Package [http://ocaml-glpk.sourceforge.net/ ocaml-glpk] developed by Samuel Mimram provides a OCaml language binding for GLPK. This binding is published under the GNU General Public License. The project homepage is [http://ocaml-glpk.sourceforge.net/ http://ocaml-glpk.sourceforge.net/].

The code uses an obsolete API. There has been no development activity after 2010-07-02 (as observed on 2012-05-02). Probably GLPK 4.44 is supported.

To give an indication of the status of this project, the maintainer advises: &quot;The bindings are not fully complete. If you need a specific function just tell me and I'll add it as soon as possible.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Because of the loyal nature associated with dogs, humans have found it useful to use these kind of friendly dogs and train them to work and captivate us using tricks. By using a bit of endurance and effort we can teach our own dogs a great number of important activities to help make our lives greater. Unless you actually do not have the time to invest in training your current dog, it is usually much better for both individual to work with your pet yourself. You can find professional dog trainers you can use to teach your dog certain regimens but they will be unable to help you bond with your four-legged friend.

 Exercising is a good marvellous way to bond with your dog. A happy dog is certainly one [http://www.amazon.com/How-To-Train-Dog-ebook/dp/B00699A196 how to train a dog] regularly exercised and has basic obedience training. And a dog that could be well-exercised will invariably much better behaved. Knowning that makes for a happy dog and a content owner!

 At this moment, let's talk about Dog Training Trainer created by Kobie Lawson and the way it may help you actually. I really hope this short Dog Training Coach Review will assist you to differentiate whether Dog Training Instructor is Con or a Real.

 When you get a new dog, it's important you will get a harbess to use for her too. It's usually required by law to have an individual's dog on a teather in most regions. You need to start things away by getting the right one for your dog.

 It is actually understandable to wish to move towards the next session when your dog performs a command properly. You are excited about your pets progress therefore you want to always keep things going into the right guidance. But the greatest strategy is to learn one endeavor before starting the next individual. This is accomplished as a result of repetition exercises, and it is by far the most essential step in successful training. Start every new wisdom by analyzing previous coaching. Build your dogs self esteem by letting him perform chores he is knowledgeable about before progressing with fresh material.

 Training clicker training is effective considering that the clicking sound is a very exceptional sound definitely not heard within everyday life. Compared with our voice which can be read often, dog clicker are listened to only when a dog does what you would like. So when the particular dog hears a clicker they know that he performed something to thrill you.

 There are 3 basic factors your dog should learn through fundamental dog training. These are: stay, stay, and are avalable. The first part associated with dog training is to tutor your dog to sit down. To start this unique dog training, you will initial need some dog snacks.

 Positive dog behavior schools and dog obedience training programs can help to shape your dog on the beauty salon diva that you know she will be. She is going to be confident, fearless in the face of grooming gizmos, and often will view grooming as quality time with you.

 Made is a great strategy to teach calm behavior. The calmer any dog, the easier plus much more enjoyable it is to be around ones dog. Your friends will enjoy you and your dog improved when they come over to your house plus your dog does not soar all over these individuals.</text>

[[File:Guangzhou-electronic-components-shop-0479.jpg|thumb|The &quot;electronic components district&quot; of [[Guangzhou]], where numerous shops sell electronic components to other companies that would use them to manufacture consumer goods.]]
'''Business-to-business''' ('''B2B''') describes commerce transactions between businesses, such as between a [[manufacturer]] and a [[wholesaler]], or between a wholesaler and a retailer.  Contrasting terms are business-to-consumer ([[business-to-consumer|B2C]]) and business-to-government ([[business-to-government|B2G]]).

The volume of B2B (Business-to-Business) transactions is much higher than the volume of B2C transactions.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sandhusen | first = Richard | title = Marketing | publisher = Barron's Educational Series | location = Hauppauge, N.Y | year = 2008 | isbn = 0764139320 | page = 520}}

For example, an automobile manufacturer makes several B2B transactions such as buying tires, glass for windscreens, and rubber hoses for its vehicles.  The final transaction, a finished vehicle sold to the consumer, is a single ([[business-to-consumer|B2C]]) transaction. 

B2B is also used in the context of communication and collaboration.  Many businesses are now using social media to connect with their consumers (B2C); however, they are now using similar tools within the business so employees can connect with one another.  When communication is taking place amongst employees, this can be referred to as &quot;B2B&quot; communication.

==Etymology==
The term was originally coined to describe the [[electronic communication]]s between [[business]]es or [[Organization|enterprises]] in order to distinguish it from the [[communication]]s between businesses and consumers (&quot;[[business-to-consumer]]&quot;). It eventually came to be used in [[marketing]] as well, initially describing only industrial or [[capital goods]] marketing. Today it is widely used to describe all products and [[Service (economics)|services]] used by enterprises. Many professional institutions and the trade publications focus much more on B2C than B2B, although most sales and marketing personnel are in the B2B sector.

'''Consumer-to-business''' ('''C2B''') is a business model in which consumers (individuals) create value, and firms consume this value. For example, when a consumer writes reviews, or when a consumers gives a useful idea for new product development, then this individual is creating value to the firm, if the firm adopts the input. Excepted concepts are crowd sourcing and co-creation. 

Another form of C2B is the electronic commerce business model, in which consumers can offer products and services to companies and the companies pay them. This business model is a complete reversal of traditional business model where companies offer goods and services to consumers (business-to-consumer = B2C).  We can see this example in blogs or internet forums where the author offers a link back to an online business facilitating the purchase of some product (like a book on Amazon.com), and the author might receive affiliate revenue from a successful sale.
. 

This kind of economic relationship is qualified as an inverted business type. The advent of the C2B scheme is due to major changes:

* Connecting a large group of people to a bidirectional network has made this sort of commercial relationship possible. The large traditional media outlets are one direction relationship whereas the internet is bidirectional one.
* Decreased cost of technology : Individuals now have access to technologies that were once only available to large companies ( digital printing and acquisition technology, high performance computer, powerful software)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{info|This page (as arguably the conventions themselves) is a work in progress.}}

This page documents some of the style conventions in use through the Haskell wikibook. Before we start, a few important remarks. 
* This page will have examples for most of the conventions present; so if you have doubts on how to add them to a page, just click edit and check the wikitext source. 
* At present many of the conventions here are still in flux; and there are several inconsistencies accumulated over the years around the book (we will point out some of the most annoying ones). You can use the [[Talk:Haskell/Style conventions|talk page]] to voice your opinions about such issues and bring them closer to resolution.
* Last, but not least: ''do not bite newcomers over these conventions!'' Not only because several of the points are not set in stone, but also because making a fuss about them would generally be counter-productive - new editors who stick around will get used to the main conventions soon enough.

== Code samples ==

The one stable convention about code samples is to use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; blocks for samples in source files and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; blocks for GHCi samples:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
numOfSolutions a b c
    | disc &gt; 0  = 2
    | disc == 0 = 1
    | otherwise = 0
        where
        disc = b^2 - 4*a*c
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; (2 + 2 == 5) || (2 &gt; 0)
True
Prelude&gt; (||) (18 == 17) (9 &gt;= 11)
False
&lt;/pre&gt;

The main difference is that source blocks have syntax highlighting, while pre blocks do not (the highlighting does not fit well with GHCi samples). Large sections of the book still do not follow this basic convention, but that is slowly being corrected (you can help with that if you find non-conforming passages). 

=== Example templates ===

Beyond the basic tags, there are also the example templates - [[Template:HaskellExample]], [[Template:HaskellGHCi]] and [[Template:HaskellGHCiExample]] - click the links to see usage instructions. As of now, these are used mostly on the first few chapters of the book. There are a few issues with the usage of such templates. In most places all they add is a caption to the examples, which is not too useful given the lack of an index of examples, plus some extra indentation to the block atop the already distinctive layout of pre/source blocks (but cf. [[Talk:Haskell#Examples|this discussion]] about the semantics of example blocks). Furthermore, their handling is annoying to editors - not just due to verbosity, but also due to the issues with escaping special characters (see [[Template:!]] and [[Template:=]]) which make adding source and pre tags automatically with the template more trouble than it is worth. Due to these issues, there is recurring talk of eliminating example templates altogether, but thus far no editor was bold enough to push in one direction or the other.   

=== Inline code ===

Inline code samples like &lt;code&gt;2 + 2 == 4&lt;/code&gt; should be within &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags (tt tags are used for that purpose in several places; they are gradually being converted to code tags). A minor technicality is that lists within lists such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[['a','b'],&quot;c&quot;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be wrapped in nowiki tags inside the code tags - otherwise MediaWiki or other renderers might process the double square brackets as wikilinks.

== Navigational templates ==

''TODO: [[Template:Haskell minitoc]], [[Template:Haskell navigation]] and the chapter templates.''

== Notes and references ==

We make liberal use of footnotes as a way to present brief but distracting digressions, external references and pointers to chapters later in the book. References should be added at the point they are anchored in the text, within &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, like this one&lt;ref&gt;foobar&lt;/ref&gt;. If a page has footnotes, [[Template:Haskell/NotesSection]] should be added to the bottom of the page, between the last section and the navigational templates at the very bottom.

{{body note|For longer digressions, create a body note like this one with [[Template:Body note]]. It would be wise not to have too many of these in a single page...}}

== Links ==

Hyperlinks can be useful, but should be used with discretion - since a wikibook is in essence still a book, it should not rely too heavily on external content and also be useful and easy to navigate in a printed version. Internal links within the book are less problematic than external links, but it is better to make to what the link points explicit (that is, &quot;as we will see in [[Haskell/More about lists|More about lists]]&quot; is better than &quot;as we will see [[Haskell/More about lists|a few chapters ahead]]&quot;). ''TODO: Mention [[Template:Haskell lib]], and when it is better to move a link to a footnote.''

== Exercises and solutions ==

''TODO: [[Template:Exercises]] and solution pages.''

== Miscellaneous ==

''TODO: math tags, clear templates and other small tricks.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Electronic commerce''', commonly known as '''e-commerce'''  or '''e-comm''', refers to the buying and selling of [[product (business)|product]]s or [[Service (economics)|service]]s over electronic systems such as the [[Internet]] and other [[computer network]]s. Electronic commerce draws on such technologies as [[electronic funds transfer]], [[supply chain management]], [[Internet marketing]], [[online transaction processing]], [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI), [[inventory management]] systems, and automated data collection systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the [[World Wide Web]] at least at one point in the transaction's life-cycle, although it may encompass a wider range of technologies such as [[e-mail]], mobile devices and telephones as well.

* Electronic commerce is generally considered to be the sales aspect of [[e-business]]. It also consists of the exchange of data to facilitate the financing and payment aspects of business transactions.

E-commerce can be divided into:
    
* E-tailing or &quot;virtual storefronts&quot; on Web sites with online catalogs, sometimes gathered into a &quot;virtual mall&quot;
* The gathering and use of demographic data through Web contacts
* Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), the business-to-business exchange of data
* E-mail and fax and their use as media for reaching prospects and established customers (for example, with newsletters)
* Business-to-business buying and selling
* The security of business transactions

==History==
===Early development===
Originally, electronic commerce was identified as the facilitation of commercial transactions electronically, using technology such as [[Electronic Data Interchange|Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)]] and [[Electronic funds transfer|Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)]]. These were both introduced in the late 1970s, allowing businesses to send commercial documents like purchase orders or invoices electronically. The growth and acceptance of credit cards, automated teller machines (ATM) and telephone banking in the 1980s were also forms of electronic commerce. Another form of e-commerce was the airline reservation system typified by Sabre in the USA and Travicom in the UK.

Beginning in the 1990s, electronic commerce would include [[enterprise resource planning]] systems (ERP), [[data mining]] and [[data warehousing]]

In 1990, [[Tim Berners-Lee]] invented the [[WorldWideWeb]] [[web browser]] and transformed an academic telecommunication network into a worldwide everyman everyday communication system called internet/www. Commercial enterprise on the [[Internet]] was strictly prohibited by NSF until 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]]: [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/tech.html?pg=2 We Are the Web] [[Wired magazine]], Issue 13.08, August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Internet became popular worldwide around 1994 with the adoption of [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser, it took about five years to introduce security protocols (i.e. SSL encryption enabled on Netscape 1.0 Browser  in late 1994) and [[DSL]] allowing continual connection to the Internet. By the end of 2000, many European and American business companies offered their services through the [[World Wide Web]]. Since then people began to associate a word &quot;[[ecommerce]]&quot; with the ability of purchasing various goods through the Internet using secure protocols and electronic payment services.

==Business applications==
[[File:Automated online assistant.png|thumb|200px|An example of an [[automated online assistant]] on a merchandising website.]]
Some common applications related to electronic commerce are the following:
* [[Document automation]] in [[supply chain]] and [[logistics]]
* Domestic and international [[payment system]]s
* [[Enterprise content management]]
* [[Group buying]]
* [[Automated online assistant]]s
* [[Instant messaging]]

* [[Electronic ticket]]s

==Governmental regulation==
In the United States, some electronic commerce activities are regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC).  These activities include the use of commercial e-mails, online advertising and consumer [[privacy]].  The [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] establishes national standards for direct marketing over e-mail. The [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] regulates all forms of advertising, including online advertising, and states that advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/ruleroad.shtm |title= Advertising and Marketing on the Internet: Rules of the Road |publisher= [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security of consumers’ personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/promises.html |title= Enforcing Privacy Promises: Section 5 of the FTC Act |publisher= [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As result, any corporate privacy policy related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.

The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which came into law in 2008, amends the [[Controlled Substances Act]] to address [[Online pharmacy|online pharmacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-6353&amp;tab=summary |title= H.R. 6353: Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 |publisher= [[Govtrack]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internationally''' there is the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN), which was formed in 1991 from an informal network of government customer fair trade organisations. The purpose was stated as being to find ways of co-operating on tackling consumer problems connected with cross-border transactions in both goods and services, and to help ensure exchanges of information among the participants for mutual benefit and understanding. From this came econsumer, as an initiative of ICPEN since April 2001. www.econsumer.gov is a portal to report complaints about online and related transactions with foreign companies.
 
There is also '''Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation''' (APEC) was established in 1989 with the vision of achieving stability, security and prosperity for the region through free and open trade and investment. APEC has an Electronic Commerce Stearing Group as well as working on common privacy regulations throughout the APEC region.
 
In '''Australia''', Trade is covered under [[Australian Treasury Guidelines for electronic commerce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.treasury.gov.au/documents/1083/HTML/docshell.asp?URL=australian_guidelines_for_electronic_commerce.htm |title=Australian Treasury Guidelines for electronic commerce|publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.accc.gov.au/ |title=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission |publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; regulates and offers advice on how to [[deal with businesses online]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/54056 |title=Dealing with Businesses Online in Australia |publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers specific advice on [[what happens if things go wrong.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/815341|title=What to do if thing go wrong in Australia|publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Also [[Australian government ecommerce website]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.digitalbusiness.gov.au|title=Australian government ecommerce website |publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides information on ecommerce in Australia.

==Forms==
Contemporary electronic commerce involves everything from ordering &quot;digital&quot; content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to &quot;meta&quot; services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce.

On the institutional level, big corporations and financial institutions use the internet to exchange financial data to facilitate domestic and international business. Data integrity and security are very hot and pressing issues for electronic commerce.

==Global trends==
Business models across the world also continue to change drastically with the advent of eCommerce and this change is not just restricted to USA. Other countries are also contributing to the growth of eCommerce. For example, the United Kingdom  has the biggest e-commerce market in the world when measured by the amount spent per capita, even higher than the USA. The [[internet economy]] in UK is likely to grow by 10% between 2010 to 2015. This has led to changing dynamics for the advertising industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/oct/28/net-worth-100bn-uk/|title=news|publisher=Guardian.co.uk | location=London|first=James|last=Robinson|date=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst emerging economies, China's eCommerce presence continues to expand. With 384 million internet users,China's online shopping sales rose to $36.6 billion in 2009 and one of the reasons behind the huge growth has been the improved trust level for shoppers. The Chinese retailers have been able to help consumers feel more comfortable shopping online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/18/china-internet-commerce-markets-equities-alibaba.html/|title= China's migration to eCommerce|newspaper=Forbes.com|date=January 18, 2010|first=Robert|last=Olsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; eCommerce is also expanding across the Middle East. Having recorded the world’s fastest growth in internet usage between 2000 and 2009, the region is now home to more than 60 million internet users. Retail, travel and gaming are the region’s top eCommerce segments, in spite of difficulties such as the lack of region-wide legal frameworks and logistical problems in cross-border transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomaswhite.com/explore-the-world/postcard/2012/middle-east-online-retail.aspx |title= Now a Digital Mall Boom in the Middle East &amp;#124; Thomas White International |publisher=Thomaswhite.com |date=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-Commerce has become an important tool for businesses worldwide not only to sell to customers but also to engage them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=Andreas B. |last2=Kretschmer |first2=Tobias |year=2008 |title=In E-Commerce, More is More |journal=Harvard Business Review |volume=86 (March) |pages=20–21 |url=http://hbr.org/2008/03/in-e-commerce-more-is-more/ar/1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on markets and retailers==
Economists have theorized that e-commerce ought to lead to intensified price [[competition (economics)|competition]], as it increases consumers' ability to gather information about products and prices. Research by four economists at the University of Chicago has found that the growth of online shopping has also affected industry structure in two areas that have seen significant growth in e-commerce, [[book selling|bookshops]] and [[travel agencies]]. Generally, larger firms have grown at the expense of smaller ones, as they are able to use [[economies of scale]] and offer lower prices. The lone exception to this pattern has been the very smallest category of bookseller, shops with between one and four employees, which appear to have withstood the trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Economics focus: The click and the dead|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16478931|newspaper=The Economist|date=July 3–9, 2010|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution channels==
E-commerce has grown in importance as companies have adopted Pure-Click and [[Bricks and clicks|Brick and Click]] channel systems. We can distinguish between pure-click and brick and click channel system adopted by companies.

* Pure-Click companies are those that have launched a website without any previous existence as a firm. It is imperative that such companies must set up and operate their e-commerce websites very carefully. Customer service is of paramount importance.
* Brick and Click companies are those existing companies that have added an online site for e-commerce. Initially, Brick and Click companies were skeptical whether or not to add an online e-commerce channel for fear that selling their products might produce channel conflict with their off-line retailers, agents, or their own stores. However, they eventually added internet to their distribution channel portfolio after seeing how much business their online competitors were generating.

This Wikibook will become the product of a research project being run by [http://cslld.edu.au The Centre for School Leadership, Learning and Development] for the [http://www.metalounge.org/ Institute of Metadata Management]. CSLLD has been asked to develop an annotated list of 10 or 15 open data initiatives, explaining how they work and include examples of where their data has been reused. We hope to attract volunteers from Wikipedia and Wikibooks to help develop and maintain this Wikibook, and to participate in the research project ([http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Open_Data see the Wikiversity page]) so that it may continue to grow and develop beyond the life of this project. We also want to model open research and development practices in a project looking at open data.

We are aiming to compete our part in this project by September 2012. Please refer to [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Open_Data the Wikiversity page] for our research progress.

'''SAL''' is a collection of stuff that the author has found useful in his projects.

A large part of SAL provides a coherent set of generic abstract data types, intended to be yet another entry in the &quot;Standard Ada Library&quot; discussion. The goal in this part of SAL was to provide Ada packages that take full advantage of the flexibility and power of Ada generics, while at the same time making things relatively easy for the casual user. This was written well before the Ada 95 and 2005 Containers library, and is mostly superseded by that library.

Another large part of SAL provides math operations for kinematics and dynamics of masses in 3 dimensional space. Cartesian vectors, quaternions, orthonormal rotation matrices, moments of inertia, forces, acceleration, velocity are supported, in 3 and 6 degrees of freedom (translation and rotation). The author has used this library for both robotics and satellite simulation. 

There are also extensions to the AUnit testing framework, a config files package, and other useful things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I, as an IB student think, that definitions of rivalrous and excludable goods are incorrect. 

According to my notes and other internet sources, 

'''rivalrous''' is something which only some people can afford (hence the ones with lower income are excluded from having the good/service)

good is'''excludable''' when if one person uses it, he decreases the enjoyment of that good of other person.

Please respond if this is correct or not and justify. Thanks, Barbora</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Wikibookians,&lt;br /&gt;

No doubt some of you are familiar with the free college courses available on [http://Saylor.org Saylor.org]. Much like the Wikimedia community, we are committed to providing free and accessible education for everyone with internet access. At Saylor, we combine some of our custom-created educational materials with materials that are already available throughout the internet. However, because we sometimes use links to third party materials, those sections of our courses are not entirely sustainable. The Saylor Wikibooks Project is a way for you to help minimize that threat. We’ve uploaded a number of our course outlines to Wikibooks in the hope that you all will contribute to our effort. Our course outlines have been developed by our consultant professors by studying a collection of syllabi of relevant courses from various traditional brick and mortar institutions. This guarantees that our students will be provided the same learning opportunity as a student enrolled in a traditional institution. We believe that we have created the best structure for our courses, which optimizes the information that students would be expected to know. By creating openly licensed content that fits in with Saylor’s established course outlines, (in the form of Wikibooks’ textbooks), you can add to the ever-expanding body of wiki material, while simultaneously improving the sustainability of our courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for your help, &lt;br /&gt;

The Saylor Team

'''&lt;big&gt;Summary&lt;/big&gt;'''

[[File:Der_Tempel_der_Juno_in_Agrigent_(C_D_Friedrich).jpg|thumb|right]]
We will study the emergence of the major civilizations of the ancient world, beginning with the Paleolithic Era (about 2.5 million years ago) and finishing with the end of the Middle Ages in fifteenth century A.D. We will pay special attention to how societies evolved across this expanse of time—from fragmented and primitive agricultural communities to more advanced and consolidated civilizations. By the end of the text, you will possess a thorough understanding of important overarching social, political, religious, and economic themes in the ancient world, ranging from the emergence of Confucian philosophy in Asia to the fall of imperial Rome. You will also understand how many aspects of these ancient civilizations continue to remain relevant in today’s world.


'''&lt;big&gt;Global Learning Outcomes&lt;/big&gt;'''

These objectives are up to date for the 2009 edition of the CompTIA Network+ exam.

The Network+ certification ensures that the successful candidate has the important knowledge and skills necessary to manage, maintain, troubleshoot, install, operate and configure basic network infrastructure, describe networking technologies, basic design principles, and adhere to wiring standards and use testing tools.

The skills and knowledge measured by this examination were derived from an industry-wide job task analysis and validated through an industry-wide global survey in Q2 2008. The results of this survey were used in weighing the domains and ensuring that the weighting is representative of the relative importance of the content.

The table to the right lists the domains measured by this examination and the extent to which they are represented. Network+ exams are based on these objectives.

''Note: The bulleted lists below each objective are not exhaustive lists. Even though they are not included in this document, other examples of technologies, processes, or tasks pertaining to each objective may also be included on the exam.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Using CDISC ODM 1.3 with OpenClinica Extensions to export to SAS ==

SAS can import data in a number of formats.  For OpenClinica version 3.x the obvious choice, due to its portability and SAS's import facilities, is CDISC ODM 1.3 XML.

The CDISC ODM 1.3 XML with OpenClinica extensions format includes two types of data:
# CDISC ODM 1.3 specification data (which SAS's libname knows how to import)
# OpenClinica extensions data (which SAS can be told how to pick up with a mapping file)
Most of the useful data is CDISC ODM 1.3, but some useful data is 'hidden' in OpenClinica extensions sections (e.g. DateOfBirth, Sex and Event Start Dates).

== SAS doesn't import OpenClinica Extensions by default ==

OpenClinica extensions aren't part of the CDISC ODM 1.3 specification, and need to be imported separately.  The code below uses a mapping file (extensions.xml) to import some, but not all, of the extensions.  Other OpenClinica extensions can be picked up from the data file by altering the mapping file appropriately - OpenClinica extensions are tags and attributes in the data file that have the Openclinica prefix, some of which are important.  The only place to obtain the Study Subject ID is by using OpenClinica:StudySubjectId - the SubjectKey refers to the internal OID, which doesn't change even if the Study Subject ID does (the OID remains SS_TEST, even if the Study Subject ID is changed to Test 2).  The CDISC ODM 1.3 schema generated by OpenClinica is also documented at [https://dev.openclinica.com/tools/odm-doc/index_ODM.html#Link248 Openclinica.com/tools/odm-doc].

== How to import CDISC ODM 1.3 XML with OpenClinica extensions into SAS ==

Download the [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/attachments/20120503/ee1a434c/attachment.xml mapping file].

Our init.sas file has pointers to directories containing:
#The data to be imported
#The mapping file to import OpenClinica Extension data
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;sas&quot;&gt;
%let orig=C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\&lt;study&gt;\Original Data\;
%let maps=C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\&lt;study&gt;\Map\;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

We import using the CDISC ODM 1.3 XML using the libname command (proc cdisc is deprecated as of SAS 9.2).  The import.sas file first imports the CDISC ODM file, then imports the OpenClinica Extensions.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;sas&quot;&gt;
* Import Screening XML file;

filename odm0 &quot;&amp;orig.&lt;filename&gt;.xml&quot;;
libname odm0 xml xmltype=CDISCODM FormatActive=YES FormatNoReplace=NO FormatLibrary=&quot;WORK&quot;; 

* Create ODM dataset;

data odm0blood;
	set odm0.Blood;
run;

* Import OpenClinica extensions values from Screening XML file;

filename ex0 &quot;&amp;orig.&lt;filename&gt;.xml&quot;;
filename sx0emap &quot;&amp;maps.extensions.xml&quot;;
libname ex0 xml92 xmlmap=sx0emap access=READONLY;

* Create OpenClinica extensions dataset;

data studyeventdata0;
	length __SUBJECTKEY $100.;
	set ex0.Studyeventdata;
run;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Issues with importing CDISC ODM 1.3 ==

=== SAS doesn't like Partial Dates ===

CDISC ODM 1.3 includes a specification for a data type called partial date, which SAS can't import (it throws an error when you try to read the file).  You may choose to not have partial dates in your study and use a text field instead, validated by a regular expression.  Alternatively you can modify the XML export before it is imported to change partial dates to text fields (see below).

=== SAS doesn't import labels ===

SAS will use a shortened version (truncated to 8 chars) of the ITEM_NAME as the field name, e.g. DMHEIGHT (the SASFieldName attribute of the ItemDef tag in the XML).  It will use the full ITEM_NAME itself as the field label (the Name attribute of the ItemDef tag in the XML).  In some cases it would be good to pick up the DESCRIPTION_LABEL as the field label (the Comment attribute of the ItemDef tag in the XML).  The code below includes a section (commentable) that switched the Name and Comment attributes of ItemDef tags around, so that DESCRIPTION_LABELs are imported as the label.

=== Field names too long for SAS ===

SAS doesn't like field names that are longer than 32 characters including the OpenClinica prefix (e.g. I_HTBAS_BLD_1STDOSESTUDYMEDSGIVEN).  You may want to use [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/CRFandOIDissues|shorter names]] (e.g. 8 character long) for new studies, but if you have an old study you may need to replace long field names with shortened versions.

=== OpenClinica (3.0.3 at least) exports badly encoded entities ===

OpenClinica can export entities that aren't defined in the DTD (see [https://issuetracker.openclinica.com/view.php?id=14287 this issuetracker bug] - OpenClinica login needed).  The script correctly escapes the leading ampersand.

== Script to clean up Partial Dates, Labels and Entities ==

The script below modifies the CDISC ODM XML directly.  For CTIMPs (Clinical Trials Involving Medicinal Products) this alters the valuable data you have been collecting, and should be done carefully, with the changes validated (how exactly is up to you).

===Notes===
*The code below is specific to Windows, and has been tested in Windows 7  
*Windows doesn’t run unsigned PowerShell scripts, so until a signed version of the script below can be created, you have to run the commands manually.
*Don't be concerned if you notice the XML files double in size, this is because PowerShell's output files are in Unicode (two bytes for every original character) to cope with international characters.  The original is most likely to have been in single byte encoding (ASCII or similar)
*The regexps could be reimplemented in Perl under Linux

===How to run the code===
#Copy the code below into Notepad (or a similar text editor)
#Alter the $extractdirectory value to point to your data extracts (paths can be obtained from the Explorertoolbar).  This script creates files ending in _new.xml from existing .xml files (and ignores existing files ending in _new.xml).
#Type cmd into the Windows Start Orb search box (which opens a terminal)
#Then copy and paste the code into the terminal (right-clicking on the terminal will open context menu from whence you can paste.)

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;

== Further information ==

This [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2012-September/007615.html OpenClinica forum thread] further discussed details of how to import data into SAS.

== OpenClinica SPSS to Stata ==
On a similar note, for those interested in Stata, there's a tool that converts SPSS to Stata here:
http://openclinica.mcri.edu.au/DMTools/OpenClinica/SPSStoStata.aspx


== Errors when importing into SPSS ==

When a dataextract is exported in SPSS-format the zip contains 2 files:

* the data, in tab-delimited format, named .dat
* an SPSS-syntax file, which can be run to add vaue and variable labels to the data, named .sps

Most of the time the syntax file must be edited, because it assumes that the dat-file is in the default SPSS directory. If this is not the case,

GET DATA  /TYPE = TXT/FILE = 'SPSS_DAT2013-04-19-200700043.dat'

must be changed into something like:

GET DATA  /TYPE = TXT/FILE = 'c:\temp\SPSS_DAT2013-04-19-200700043.dat'

Also error messages appear referring to dates. The reason why dates are not imported correctly is in the different date
formats in the .dat file and the .sps file:
The .dat file contains dates in searchable format whereas the .sps file
expects American date format. If you change all ADATE to SDATE in the the
spss syntax (search&amp;replace) then it should work.

== SAS, R and CSV xsl Transformations ==
Some excellent xsl transform files were made available by Linas Silva on [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/developers/2014-January/005544.html this developers list thread] ([https://github.com/lindsay-stevens-kirby/openclinica_scripts/tree/master/OC_XML_to_SAS_R_CSV also available here]). 

These transformations can be run on full ODM 1.3 xml extracts, with the accompanying powershell scripts. The CSV powershell script is probably the most important as it chops up the output csv into into a series of csvs. 

Alternatively, the transforms can be run without powershell, instead using the copy of the saxon library that comes with OpenClinica. Example syntax (all on one line):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
&quot;path_to_java.exe&quot; -cp &quot;path_to_tomcat\webapps\OpenClinica3141\WEB-INF\lib\saxon-8.7.jar&quot; 
net.sf.saxon.Transform -o &quot;output_file_path.ext&quot; &quot;input_xml_file.xml&quot; &quot;path_to_xsl.xsl&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Each of the xsl files refer to renaming map stylesheet called 'xml_convert_dynamic_lookup' which lists the CRF and Item Group name combinations and what they should be renamed to in the output. If this is not used, the dataset names default to the Item Group OID.


=== applying the script for SAS ===
For SAS transfomations, use the script titled '''powershell_perform_SAS_xsl_transforms.ps1'''. This is a powershell-script, so you should open a command-prompt as administrator. 
Change to the directory where you unzipped the script plus the *.xsl-files and start powershell.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
cd Yourdrive:\YourPath\ExportODM
powershell
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Now you have a Powershell-prompt and first you must set the Execution policy:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Running the script is done with one big line, invoking the script with 7 parameters:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;
.\powershell_perform_SAS_xsl_transforms.ps1 &quot;RDP001_ODM_20140311.xml&quot; &quot;xml_convert_sas_map.xsl&quot; &quot;sasmap_rdp001_20140310.map&quot; &quot;xml_convert_sas_data.xsl&quot; &quot;data_rdp1_20140311.xml&quot; &quot;xml_convert_sas_format.xsl&quot; &quot;formatout_20140310.sas&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The parameters are:
* &quot;RDP001_ODM_20140311.xml&quot; and this must be the name of your dataextract in ODM1.3-format
* &quot;xml_convert_sas_map.xsl&quot; is one of the *.xsl-files of the zip, so do not change this one
* &quot;sasmap_rdp001_20140310.map&quot; is the mapping-file that is created and you can give this any name you want
* &quot;xml_convert_sas_data.xsl&quot; is one of the *.xsl-files of the zip, so again: do not change this one 
* &quot;data_rdp1_20140311.xml&quot; is the resulting sas-data-file
* &quot;xml_convert_sas_format.xsl&quot; is one of the *.xsl-files of the zip: no changing this one
* &quot;formatout_20140310.sas&quot; is a SAS-file wit info about radio- and singleselect-options

Hi, Stephe. I reviewed your SAL article. Another user removed your email address and the link to the library. The deletion of the email was probably correct but I have restored the homepage. I have also give the article an impersonal style, since in Wikibooks the personal style is deprecated because it does not encourage collaboration and editing of articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Wikipedians,&lt;br /&gt;

No doubt some of you are familiar with the free college courses available on [http://Saylor.org Saylor.org]. Much like the Wikimedia community, we are committed to providing free and accessible education for everyone with internet access. At Saylor, we combine some of our custom-created educational materials with materials that are already available throughout the internet. However, because we sometimes use links to third party materials, those sections of our courses are not entirely sustainable. The Saylor Wikibooks Project is a way for you to help minimize that threat. We’ve uploaded a number of our course outlines to Wikibooks in the hope that you all will contribute to our effort. Our course outlines have been developed by our consultant professors by studying a collection of syllabi of relevant courses from various traditional brick and mortar institutions. This guarantees that our students will be provided the same learning opportunity as a student enrolled in a traditional institution. We believe that we have created the best structure for our courses, which optimizes the information that students would be expected to know. By creating openly licensed content that fits in with Saylor’s established course outlines, (in the form of Wikibooks’ textbooks), you can add to the ever-expanding body of wiki material, while simultaneously improving the sustainability of our courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for your help,&lt;br /&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Summary&lt;/big&gt;'''

[[File:C_plus_plus.svg|thumb|right]]
We will begin with a discussion of the essential elements of C++ programming: variables, loops, expressions, functions, and string class.  Next, we will cover the basics of object-oriented programming: classes, inheritance, templates, exceptions, and file manipulation.  We will then review function and class templates and the classes that perform output and input of characters to/from files.  This text will also cover the topics of namespaces, exception handling, and preprocessor directives.  In the last part of the text, we will learn some slightly more sophisticated programming techniques that deal with data structures such as linked lists and binary trees.

The starting point for this wiki-book is a synopsis of analytical chemiluminescence, &lt;http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/chemiluminescence&gt;. In its fifteen thousand words it does not attempt to summarise all the work done to date. It aims to use mainly well-established literature to give a brief introduction to the achievements of each division of the field. It deals with the research and development that underlies the present state of the art. The chemistry of each reagent that has been used in chemiluminescence is explained and the techniques for increasing the magnitude of the emitted signal are discussed. Further sections describe the different instrumental methods that have been used and examine the sort of work that has been carried out with them. The final sections discuss the applications of chemiluminescence in some of the major areas of analytical chemistry. The aim of the book is to give a comprehensive account of the subject suitable for students, research workers, professional analytical chemists and life scientists.

==Introduction==
Section 29 of the Canada Evidence Act recognizes the high degree of reliability in business documents from financial institutions by permitting &quot;any book or record kept in a financial institution&quot; to be admissible as evidence. 

==Statute==
Section 29 concerns documents of financial institutions:
{{quotation|
'''Copies of entries'''&lt;br&gt;
29. (1) Subject to this section, a copy of any entry in any book or record kept in any financial institution shall in all legal proceedings be admitted in evidence as proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, of the entry and of the matters, transactions and accounts therein recorded.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Admission in evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) A copy of an entry in the book or record described in subsection (1) shall not be admitted in evidence under this section unless it is first proved that the book or record was, at the time of the making of the entry, one of the ordinary books or records of the financial institution, that the entry was made in the usual and ordinary course of business, that the book or record is in the custody or control of the financial institution and that the copy is a true copy of it, and such proof may be given by any person employed by the financial institution who has knowledge of the book or record or the manager or accountant of the financial institution, and may be given orally or by affidavit sworn before any commissioner or other person authorized to take affidavits.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Cheques, proof of “no account”'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Where a cheque has been drawn on any financial institution or branch thereof by any person, an affidavit of the manager or accountant of the financial institution or branch, sworn before any commissioner or other person authorized to take affidavits, setting out that he is the manager or accountant, that he has made a careful examination and search of the books and records for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not that person has an account with the financial institution or branch and that he has been unable to find such an account, shall be admitted in evidence as proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that that person has no account in the financial institution or branch.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Proof of official character'''&lt;BR&gt;
(4) Where evidence is offered by affidavit pursuant to this section, it is not necessary to prove the signature or official character of the person making the affidavit if the official character of that person is set out in the body of the affidavit.
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-5, s. 29; 1994, c. 44, s. 90; 1995, c. 28, s. 47; 1999, c. 28, s. 149.|[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html#sec29]}}

==Principles==
For documents to be admissible under s. 29 of the CEA, the party seeking to admit the document must show that:
# the book or record was, at the time of making of the entry, one of the ordinary books or record of the financial institutions;
# that the original book or record is in the custody or control of the financial institution nad 
# the copy is a &quot;true copy&quot;

All these elements can be proven by way of affidavit usually from the manager or accountant of the institution. However, there is no specific requirement as to whom it must be from.

For the purposes of s. 29, &quot;record&quot; can include computer printouts.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v McMullen (1979) 47 CCC (2d) (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R v Bell (1982) 65 CCC (2d) 376 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;true copy&quot; is any copy that can be said to be accurate in all essential particulars, so that no one can be misled as to the effect of the record.&lt;ref&gt;R v Morash (1982) 17 MVR 34 (SKQB) citing Commercial Credit Co. of Canada v Fulton Brothers, [1923] AC 798 (PC)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notice==

Any records that are admissible under s. 29 do not need notice to produce.&lt;Ref&gt;1.7 R. v. Best (1978), 43 C.C.C. (2d) 236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common law==
Business documents are admissible under the common law where they meet the following requirements:&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Monkhouse [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6j7 1987 ABCA 227], [1988] 1 W.W.R. 725 at para 23 to 25&lt;br&gt;
Ares v. Venner, [1970] SCR 608 [http://canlii.ca/t/1nl92 1970 CanLII 5]&lt;br&gt;
R v O'Neil, [http://canlii.ca/t/frg82 2012 ABCA 162]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 
# it is an original entry;
# it was made at the time of the event;
# it was made in the routine of business;
# it was made by a person who has personal knowledge of the thing recorded;
# who had a duty to make the record; and
# the maker had no motive to misrepresent

The fundamental rationale behind this rule that permits records being tendered into evidence without calling the author is not to avoid the inconvenience of bringing in the witnesses or because of no reasonable alternative. Rather it is premised on the documents having been created &quot;under circumstances which makes them inherently trustworthy.  Where an established system in a business or other organization produces records which are regarded as reliable and customarily accepted by those affected by them, they should be admitted as prima facie evidence.&quot; &lt;reF&gt;
R v Monkhouse, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6j7 1987 ABCA 227] at p. 350 to 351
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Statute==
Section 30 of the CEA allows &quot;business records&quot;--that is records from organizations other than financial institutions--to be tendered as evidence for the truth of their contents without needing the author of the documents to give evidence.

The admission of the record requires an affidavit setting out the requirements that make them business records and that there is timely notice to the defence of the record and affidavit no less than 7 days before their admission. &lt;ref&gt;e.g. R v Meier, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqtt9 2012 SKPC 41] at 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of of section 30 is to provide a method of putting business records into evidence beyond what is permitted by the common law and principled hearsay exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Handous, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqhfq 2012 ABPC 49] at 16&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is failure to provide notice, then the document can still be admissible at common law by having the affiant give ''viva voce'' evidence instead.

{{quotation|
'''Business records to be admitted in evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
30. (1) Where oral evidence in respect of a matter would be admissible in a legal proceeding, a record made in the usual and ordinary course of business that contains information in respect of that matter is admissible in evidence under this section in the legal proceeding on production of the record.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Inference where information not in business record'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where a record made in the usual and ordinary course of business does not contain information in respect of a matter the occurrence or existence of which might reasonably be expected to be recorded in that record, the court may on production of the record admit the record for the purpose of establishing that fact and may draw the inference that the matter did not occur or exist.
|[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html#sec30 CEA]}}

Unlike the common law, there is no requirement that the maker is under a duty to make it.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Wilcox (2001) 152 CCC 3d 157 (NSCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Business Records Defined===
A business record is a form of an unsworn statement.

Under s. 30(12), business records include &quot;the whole or any part  of any book, document, paper, card, tape or other thing on or in which information is written, recorded, stored or reproduced&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Evidence Act s. 30(12) [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html#sec30]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under s.30(10), business records made &quot;in the course of an investigation or inquiry&quot; are not admissible as business documents.&lt;ref&gt;
See R v  Sunila, (1986) 26 CCC (3d) 331(NSTD)&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering whether a computer stored information is a business record, the court should have regards to several factors:&lt;ref&gt;
Davis, Hutchinson, &quot;Computer Crime in Canada&quot; (Carswell) at p.205 citing K.Chasse &quot;Business Documents: Admissibility of Computer-Produced Records&quot; [1991] Crown's Newsletter 27 at 36
&lt;/ref&gt;
# Sources of Data and Information: there should be an identifiable source of the record and the source should be reliable
# Contemporaneous Recording: the recordings should be made shortly after the events they record
# Routine Business Data: the creation should be part of a routine of recording
# Data Entry: there should be evidence of the process used to input the information
# Industry Standards: where there is a standard, compliance with the standard should be shown
# Business Reliance: there should be some demonstrated reliance on the records
# System Continuity: there should be some evidence from the records keeper or system manager explaining the integrity of the system, including protections against tampering or errors

There is some suggestion that the method of printing out the document should be presented.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Rowbotham (1977) 33 CCC (2d) 411 (Ont.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 30(10) clarifies that certain documents are not to be included as business documents. That includes: 
* records made in the course of an investigation or inquiry,
* a record made in the course of obtaining or giving legal advice or in contemplation of a legal proceeding,
* a record in respect of the production of which any privilege exists and is claimed, or
* a record of or alluding to a statement made by a person who is not, or if he were living and of sound mind would not be, competent and compellable to disclose in the legal proceeding a matter disclosed in the record;
*any record the production of which would be contrary to public policy; or
* any transcript or recording of evidence taken in the course of another legal proceeding.

{{reflist|2}}

====Records Produced during the course of the investigation====
Records produced during the course of the investigation include police notes and reports and any other documents that police create.
As stated in reference to s.30(10), there is an exception to the rule of admissibility of such documents as business records. These types of documents cannot be admissible under s.30. This does not mean that they are not admissible under the common law.&lt;ref&gt;
see  R v Monkhouse [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6j7 1987 ABCA 227], (1987), 83 AR 62 at para 15 per Laycraft CJA regarding summary of payroll records (&quot;In my view the evidence tendered was admissible under the common law rule and it is not necessary to consider whether it also met the tests of Section 30.&quot;)&lt;br&gt; 
R v Bloomfield (1973), 6 NBR (2d) 5 (CA)&lt;br&gt;
c.f. R v Schertzer [http://canlii.ca/t/1vhkh 2008 CanLII 1836] (ON SC), (2008), 232 CCC (3d) 218 (Ont SC) at para 9&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Notice===
Notice requirements for business records are addressed under s. 30(7) of the Canada Evidence Act [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html]:
{{quotation|
s. 30(7)&lt;br&gt;
:'''Notice of intention to produce record or affidavit'''
::(7) Unless the court orders otherwise, no record or affidavit shall be admitted in evidence under this section unless the party producing the record or affidavit has, at least seven days before its production, given notice of his intention to produce it to each other party to the legal proceeding and has, within five days after receiving any notice in that behalf given by any such party, produced it for inspection by that party.
}}

Essentially, notice of intention to admit the documents as well as a copy of the document must be served on the other parties within seven days. 

The purpose of the notice provision is to &quot;alert the accused to the fact that the prosecution intends to produce a copy of the document at trial&quot;&lt;ref&gt; R v Cordes (1978) 40 CCC (2d) 442 (ABCA)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to &quot;prevent surprise&quot; and &quot;ensure that the accused is able to make full answer and defence&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Handous, 2012 ABPC 49 at 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice can be either formal or informal, even oral notice can be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Schiel, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m7s2 2005 BCPC 581] &lt;br&gt;
R v Handous, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqhfq 2012 ABPC 49] at 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The court has discretion to exempt a party from this rule. For example, in R. v. Mahoney [http://canlii.ca/t/2dk1s 1986 ABCA 195], the accused refused to acknowledge his record at the sentencing hearing. A written record was submitted and an officer testified to its reliability. The judge admitted the record but it was overturned on appeal.

Exemption should only be given where it will not prejudice the accused.&lt;Ref&gt; John Sopinka and Sidney N. Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases Toronto: Butterworths (1974) at page 92 (the exemption can be given where the &quot;record is simple and not detailed&quot; and where it &quot;feels that the opposite party will not be severely prejudiced as a result of such lack of notice.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

In R. v. Kennedy, 2008 NSPC 73, the judge refused to allow a printout from a computer screen with only one day notice.

Factors to be considered for exempting the notice provisions include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Nguyen et al [http://canlii.ca/t/1hjsb 2001 ABPC 52]&lt;/ref&gt;
#The amount of notice given,
#Amount of time prosecution had access to the notice,
#Volume of evidence,
#Reasonableness of any explanation for the delay,
#Any prejudice created by the lack of notice.

Hello, QU. Yes you are right - it is copied from a wwebsite that I constructed myself, but I have not yet got around to adding a reference and/or link to the original . I am totally new to wiki, so it willtake me some time to get my contributions looking presentable. Thanks for your interest. --[[User:Rawheatley|Rawheatley]] ([[User talk:Rawheatley|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rawheatley|contribs]]) 22:35, 4 May 2012 (UTC)

Thanks, QU, for  for your general advice andthe work you have done tidying up my contributions. That will speed things up considerably and the page looks quite smart now. I am now going to add the link that you mentioned (I hope).--[[User:Rawheatley|Rawheatley]] ([[User talk:Rawheatley|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rawheatley|contribs]]) 17:53, 8 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Wikipedians,&lt;br /&gt;

No doubt some of you are familiar with the free college courses available on [http://Saylor.org Saylor.org]. Much like the Wikimedia community, we are committed to providing free and accessible education for everyone with internet access. At Saylor, we combine some of our custom-created educational materials with materials that are already available throughout the internet. However, because we sometimes use links to third party materials, those sections of our courses are not entirely sustainable. The Saylor Wikibooks Project is a way for you to help minimize that threat. We’ve uploaded a number of our course outlines to Wikibooks in the hope that you all will contribute to our effort. Our course outlines have been developed by our consultant professors by studying a collection of syllabi of relevant courses from various traditional brick and mortar institutions. This guarantees that our students will be provided the same learning opportunity as a student enrolled in a traditional institution. We believe that we have created the best structure for our courses, which optimizes the information that students would be expected to know. By creating openly licensed content that fits in with Saylor’s established course outlines, (in the form of Wikibooks’ textbooks), you can add to the ever-expanding body of wiki material, while simultaneously improving the sustainability of our courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for your help,  &lt;br /&gt;

The Saylor Team

'''&lt;big&gt;Summary&lt;/big&gt;'''

[[File:Dáil_Chamber.jpg|thumb|right]]
Like it or not, we can’t escape politics.  Politics, a term best defined as the distribution, exercise, and consequences of power, exists at multiple levels in our society and in our daily lives.  We experience politics in action, for example, in international negotiations, government policy choices, our workplace, and even in our own families.  This course focuses its efforts on exploring the formal, public sphere of politics and power relations through a systematic study and comparison of types of government and political systems.

Comparatists (practitioners of comparative politics) seek to identify and understand the similarities and differences between these systems by taking broad topics—say, for example, “democracy” or “freedom”—and breaking them down into factors that can be found in individual systems.  We call this general approach “the comparative method.”  The goal of the comparative method is to identify the factors and/or categories of analysis to effectively compare and contrast different political phenomena.  Using the comparative method, we can tackle broader, more complicated questions like: Are certain forms of representative democracy more effective than others?  Why are some countries extremely prosperous, while others are extremely poor?  How does the degree of authoritarian control by a government drive economic development?  Does culture impact quality of governance?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==

According to Everett M. Rogers, diffusion is “...the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” &lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M. (1995). Diffusion of Innovations (4th ed.). New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In otherwords, diffusion of innovations is the manner in which new practices/objects is communicated by people.  

Innovations typically have an s-shaped rate of adoption.  There are five different types of adopter in the whole diffusion of innovations process which are identified by how early they adopt the innovation.  The five types of adopters, in order from those adopted earliest to latest, are: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M. (1994). A history of communication study: A biographical approach. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate of adoption between these groups follows a bell shaped standard deviation curve. &lt;ref&gt;http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwitr/docs/diffusion/&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are five stages with respect to how an individual chooses to adopt an innovation or not. The first stage takes place when the potential adopter becomes aware of the innovation.  The second stage has the potential adopter projecting a positive or negative attitude towards the innovation. The third stage has the entity making a decision to adopt or not.  The fourth has the adopter implementing the the innovation.  The last stage evaluates the innovation. &lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M. (1995). Diffusion of Innovations (4th ed.). New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Probability is a concept that is extremely prevalent in the study of Information Markets and Economics in general. It is particularly useful when examining [[Network Externalities|&quot;Network Externalities&quot;]] as well as Economic Prediction Models. The following will provide a brief background on probability and address its specific uses with regard to Information Markets. 

==General==
According to the Business Dictionary, probability is defined as the quantitative measure of the likelihood of something occurring.&lt;ref name=&quot;busdic&quot;&gt;business.yourdictionary.com, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In other words probability is the chance that something happens in a certain way. This chance can be non-influenced or random, which is known as physical probability, or it can be influenced by certain factors which is known as evidential probability. Physical probability is somewhat of the classical idea of probability while evidential is more of a real world application. Physical probability will be given a brief overview in order to understand the general concepts however the large focus of this page will be toward evidential probability as this is the more relevant type of probability to information markets. 

==Mathematical Definition and Basic Laws==
===Main Laws===
The concept or probability has two main laws or axioms that define it. They are:
# The probability of any occurrence is a real number between the value of 0 and 1 inclusive. &lt;ref name=&quot;Strevens&quot;&gt;Strevens, Michael, ''Probability and Chance'', The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
# The probability of an occurrence that never happens is 0 and the probability of an occurrence that always happens is 1. &lt;ref name=&quot;Strevens&quot; /&gt;

===Notation===
The probability of an occurrence is written as &lt;big&gt;P(A) = X&lt;/big&gt;. This is read as the the probability of event A occurring is equal to some value X. For example, if we were to measure the chance that the earth is round, we could say that given A=Earth is round,&lt;big&gt;P(A) = 1 &lt;/big&gt;, since it is always true that the Earth is round.
The

===Basic Situations=== 
* Not Event: Since we know that the probability of an event A occurring is written as &lt;big&gt;P(A)&lt;/big&gt;, and that all probabilities must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, then we can say that the probability of even A not occurring is &lt;big&gt;1 - P(A)&lt;/big&gt;. &lt;ref name=&quot;Omega Math&quot;&gt; Omegamath.com 1998 &lt;/ref&gt;

* Multiple Events separate: If two events A and B are completely separate from one another, then the probability of both events occurring is written as &lt;big&gt;P(A and B)/big&gt;. This is equivalent to &lt;big&gt;P(A)P(B)&lt;/big&gt;.  An example of separate multiple events would be if there were two pitchers in two different baseball games, and one wanted to know what the probability be that they both threw fastballs on the first pitch. &lt;ref name=&quot;Omega Math&quot; /&gt;

====Mutually Exclusive====
Mutually exclusive is a concept needed to understand the other basic situations. The term mutually exclusive signifies when two events are a possible result of a single occurrence. For example, in baseball when one is up to bat, the pitcher may throw a curveball or a fastball. The probability of getting a curveball or fastball are two events on the single occurrence of the first pitch at bat. This would be signified by the notation &lt;big&gt;P(A or B) or P(A U B)&lt;/big&gt;. This is equivalent to &lt;big&gt;P(A) + P(B)&lt;/big&gt;. &lt;ref name=&quot;Omega Math&quot; /&gt;

If two events of a single occurrence are not mutually exclusive, that implies that their is some overlap is the possible events. For example, if one was collecting baseball cards he or she wanted to know the probability of getting a rookie card or a pitcher's card. Since there will be cards for rookie pitchers these to events are not mutually exclusive. This situation is denoted by &lt;big&gt;P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)&lt;/big&gt;. Conceptually this expression makes sense as you have to remove the probability of both happening so you don't count it twice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Omega Math&quot; /&gt;


==Physical Probability==
Physical probability, also known as Classical probability is study of physical objects which have which have equally possible events for every occurrence. Examples of this include heads or tails on a coin, number sides on a die, or drawing a certain card in a card deck. It is probability at its basis. The classical theory of probability, written by Laplace is what governs this type of probability. It states that the probability of a favorable event occurring, is equal to the total number of favorable events, divided by the total number of possible events. &lt;ref name=&quot;Classic&quot;&gt; Laplace, ''Classical'', Stats.org/uk , 1999 &lt;/ref&gt;. If one were to examine this using a simple coin toss, then the probability of the coin landing heads would be 1 possible favorable outcome, divided by 2 total possible outcomes (heads and tails). so using probability notation &lt;big&gt;P(H) = 1/2 where H = a coin landing on heads when tossed.&lt;/big&gt;

==Evidential Probability==
Evidential Probability has to do with the study of uncertain situations given certain knowledge or known factors. &lt;ref name=&quot;Roch&quot;&gt; Kyburg H., ''Evidential Probability'', University of Rochester, 1991 &lt;/ref&gt; In other words, given a situation where the result is not known, one is provided with knowledge or evidence of why certain events may be the ending result, and from that evidence the probability of each event occurring is derived. Examples of this are the chances a man on trial will be convicted or acquitted. The probability of each of these outcomes is influenced by the evidence presented on trial and how each juror interprets that evidence. In the study of Information Markets, evidential probability is the type of probability that is most prevalent. 

===Conditional Probability===
To express a probability where one event is dependent on the given evidence of another, the concept of conditional probability is used. If one had two events A and B, a conditional probability would be the chance of event B occurring given that event A has occurred. This is expressed by the notation &lt;big&gt;P(B|A)&lt;/big&gt;, which is equivalent to &lt;big&gt;P(A and B)/P(A)&lt;/big&gt;. &lt;ref name=&quot;Yale&quot;&gt; Easton V. and McColl's J., ''Conditional Probability'', Stat.Yale.edu , 1997 &lt;/ref&gt;    
  
==Common Applications of Probability in Information Markets==
===Information Cascades===
Information cascades are a very common application of probability in information markets. Cascades are centered around evidential probability and more specifically conditional probability. The goal of the cascade is to guess the correct decision based on the evidence of prior events. For a detailed analysis of information cascades, visit the discussion section in [[Strategy for Information Markets/Network Externalities/Two Bandwagons|Network Externalities Two Bandwagons]]

===Prediction Markets===
Prediction Markets are another area of study in Information markets where probability is applied. In prediction markets, prices are determined by the probability of a certain event occurring and the belief by individuals that a certain event will occur. &lt;ref name=&quot;Pred&quot;&gt; Wolfers, J. and Zitzewitz E., ''Prediction Markets'', Journal of Economic Perspectives University of Pensylvania, 2004 &lt;/ref&gt; For more information on Prediction Markets visit [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market Prediction Markets].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section, we will encounter most important application of group theory. This is the notion of an ''action'' on some object. Over-generalizing slightly, we only care about groups ''because'' they act on things.

== Group Actions ==

There are two equivalent ways to define a group action. We will present both, then prove their equivalence.


'''Definition 1a:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; a set. Then a ''group action'' (or just ''action'') of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a binary operation &lt;math&gt;*\,:\,G\times X\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;,

:i) &lt;math&gt;e*x=x&lt;/math&gt;

:ii) &lt;math&gt;g*(h*x)=(gh)*x&lt;/math&gt;


'''Definition 1b:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; a set. Then a ''group action'' (or just ''action'') of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\sigma\,:\, G\rightarrow S_X&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 2:''' Definitions 1a and 1b are equivalent.

''Proof'': We must show that for each binary operationas in Definition 1a there is a unique homomorphism as in Definition 1b and vice versa. Given the binary operation, define the permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma(g)\in S_X&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\sigma(g)(x)=g*x&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\sigma(g)\circ\sigma(h)(x)=\sigma(g)(\sigma(h)(x))=g*(h*x)=(gh)*x=\sigma(gh)(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;G\rightarrow S_X&lt;/math&gt;. Now, given a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, define a binary operation &lt;math&gt;*\,:\, G\times X\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;g*x=\sigma(g)(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;e*x=\sigma(e)(x)=\mathrm{id}_X(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g*(h*x)=\sigma(g)\circ\sigma(h)(x)=\sigma(gh)(x)=(gh)*x&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is a binary operation satisfying the axioms in Definition 1a, and we are done. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Example 3:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts on itself by left multiplication, that is, &lt;math&gt;g*h=gh&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a any subgroup. Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts on the left cosets &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; by left multiplication, that is, &lt;math&gt;g*(g^\prime H)=(gg^\prime)H&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 5:''' A set which is acted on by a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;''-set''.


'''Definition 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group acting on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then the action of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be

:i) ''faithfull'' if &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the only element in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g*x=x&lt;/math&gt; for ''all'' &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, and

:ii) ''free'' if &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the only element in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g*x=x&lt;/math&gt; for ''any'' element in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 7:''' A group acting on itself by left multiplication is a free action. Thus is it also faithfull.


'''Definition 8:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set. The action is called ''transitive'' if for any &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; sich that &lt;math&gt;y=g*x&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 9:''' We see that the actions in Example 3 and Example 4 are transitive.


'''Definition 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set and &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Define the ''orbit of ''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be the set &lt;math&gt;G*x=\{g*x\mid g\in G\}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 11:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set and &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Define the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;x\sim y \,\Leftrightarrow\, (\exist g\in G) y=g*x \,\Leftrightarrow\, y\in G*x&lt;/math&gt;. (Check that this ''is'' an equivalence relation!) Then &lt;math&gt;X/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''orbit space'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and we write &lt;math&gt;X/\sim \equiv X/G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 12:''' Since the action is obviously transitive on each orbit, to &quot;understand&quot; group actions we only have to understand ''transitive'' actions.


'''Definition 13:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set. The ''stabilizer'' of &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;G_x=\{g\in G\mid g*x=x\}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 14:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set and let &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Since &lt;math&gt;e*x=x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e\in G_x&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G_x&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(ab)*x=a*(b*x)=a*x=x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;ab\in G_x&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, &lt;math&gt;x=e*x=(b^{-1}b)*x=b^{-1}*(b*x)=b^{-1}*x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;b^{-1}\in G_x&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Lemma 15:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set, &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=g*a\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;G_b=gG_ag^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;h\in G_a&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(ghg^{-1})*b=(ghg^{-1}g)*a=(gh)*a=g*(h*a)=g*a=b&lt;/math&gt;, showing &lt;math&gt;gG_ag^{-1}\subseteq G_b&lt;/math&gt;. To show &lt;math&gt;G_b\subseteq gG_ag^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, note that &lt;math&gt;a=g^{-1}*b&lt;/math&gt; and follow the same arugment, obtaining &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}G_bg\subseteq G_a&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


A &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set is an algebraic structure, and as in any situation where we have several instances of a structure, we cannot resist the temptation to introduce maps between them.


'''Definition 16:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-sets with binary operations &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*^\prime&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Then a function &lt;math&gt;f\,:\, X\rightarrow X^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''equivariant'' function if &lt;math&gt;f(g*x)=g*^\prime f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called an isomorphism if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bijective.


'''Lemma 17:''' Compositions of equivariant functions are equivariant.

''Proof'': Trivial. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 18:''' Every transitive action of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to left multiplication on &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H=G_x&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': By Lemma 15, the stabilizers of any two elements in an orbit are conjugate and so isomorphic. Thus the chosen element ''is'' arbitrary. Let &lt;math&gt;f\,:\, G/H\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f(gH)=g*x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;g_1H=g_2H&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;g_1g_2^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;(g_1g_2^{-1})*x=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_1*x=g_2*x&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined. Now let &lt;math&gt;h\,:\, X\rightarrow G/H&lt;/math&gt; be defined by &lt;math&gt;h(g*x)=gH&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;g_1*x=g_2*x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(g_1g_2^{-1})*x=x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;g_1g_2^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_1H=g_2H&lt;/math&gt; showing that &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; are obviously inverses of each other, this shows that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection. To prove equivariance, observe that &lt;math&gt;f(g_1gH)=(g_1g)*x=g_1*(g*x)=g_1*f(gH)&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 19 (orbit stabilizer theorem):''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set and &lt;math&gt;G*x&lt;/math&gt; the orbit of &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;|G*x||G_x|=|G|&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Indeed, from Theorem 18 and Lagrange's theorem we obtain &lt;math&gt;|G*x||G_x|=|G|&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 20:''' The orbit of &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set is said to be ''trivial'' if &lt;math&gt;G*x=\{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; whose orbits are trivial. Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;Z=\{x\in X\mid (\forall g\in G) g*x=x\}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 21:''' Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group acting on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Next, let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set containing exactly one element from each nontrivial orbit of the action. Then, &lt;math&gt;|S|=|Z|+\sum_{a\in A} |G/G_a|&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Since the orbits partition &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of cardinalities of the orbits. All the trivial orbits are contained in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;|S|=|Z|+\sum_{a\in A} |G*a|&lt;/math&gt;. By Corollary 19, &lt;math&gt;|G*a|=|G/G_a|&lt;/math&gt;, proving the lemma. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 22:''' A &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;''-group'' is a group whose order is a finite power of a prime integer &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Corollary 23:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-group acting on a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;|S|\equiv |Z|\ \mathrm{mod}\ p&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Since &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-group, &lt;math&gt;|G*a|&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; defined as in Lemma 21. Thus &lt;math&gt;\sum_{a\in A}|G*a|\equiv 0\ \mathrm{mod}\ p&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


== Group Representations ==

Linear group actions on vector spaces are especially interesting. These have a special name and comprise a subfield of group theory on their own, called ''group representation theory''.　We will only touch slightly upon it here.

'''Definition 24:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Then a ''representation'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a map &lt;math&gt;\Phi\,:\, G\times V\rightarrow V&lt;/math&gt; such that

:i) &lt;math&gt;\Phi(g)\,:\, V\rightarrow V&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\Psi(g)(v)=\Psi(g,v)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt;, is linear in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

:ii) &lt;math&gt;\Phi(e,v)=v&lt;/math&gt;

:iii) &lt;math&gt;\Phi\left(g_1,\Phi(g_2,v)\right)=\Phi(g_1g_2,v)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g_1,g_2\in G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt;.

V is called the ''representation space'' and the dimension of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, if it is finite, is called the ''dimension'' or ''degree'' of the representation.


'''Remark 25:''' Equivalently, a representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow GL(V,F)&lt;/math&gt;. A representation can be given by listing &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(V,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.


As a representation is a special kind of group action, all the concepts we have introducd for actions apply for representations.


'''Definition 26:''' A representation of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on a vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is called ''faithful'' or ''effective'' if &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow GL(V,F)&lt;/math&gt; is injective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conditional Probability ==

If &lt;math&gt; Pr(A|B) = &lt;/math&gt; '''&quot;Probability of A given B&quot;''' or '''&quot;Probability of A conditioned on B&quot;'''

then,

&lt;math&gt; Pr(A|B) = \frac {Pr(A\ AND\ B)}{Pr(B)}&lt;/math&gt;


=== Bayes' Rule ===

&lt;math&gt; Pr(B|A) = \frac { Pr(A|B)Pr(B) } { Pr(A|B)Pr(B)+Pr(A|NotB)Pr(NotB) } &lt;/math&gt;

== Condorcet Jury Theorem ==

=== Binomial Distribution ===
If the probability of one success is &lt;math&gt;\text{ }p&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;  Pr(k\text{ successes in}\ n\ \text{trials}) = 	\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{(n-k)} &lt;/math&gt;

while 

*&lt;math&gt; p^k\ &lt;/math&gt; stands for the probability of a particular &lt;math&gt;\text{  }k&lt;/math&gt; trial being a success

*&lt;math&gt;  (1-p)^{(n-k)} &lt;/math&gt; stands for the probability of a particular &lt;math&gt;\text{  }(n-k)&lt;/math&gt; trial being a failure


and in math,

*&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{k} = \frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}  &lt;/math&gt;


=== Group Decision/Voting ===
In order to determine if a group decision/voting is correct, the number of successes &lt;math&gt;\text{  }C&lt;/math&gt; needs to be more than half of &lt;math&gt;\text{  }n&lt;/math&gt;. The following formula derived from the Binomial Distribution Function tells the chance of the right group decision.

In the case here, by eliminating the situation that the vote is a tie, let's assume that the number of votes &lt;math&gt;\text{  }n&lt;/math&gt; is odd so that &lt;math&gt;\text{  }C&lt;/math&gt; could be more than half of &lt;math&gt;\text{  }n&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore,

&lt;math&gt; Pr(C) = \sum_{k=\frac{n+1}{2}}^{n} \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{(n-k)}  &lt;/math&gt;

=== Influence-Dependent Model of Group Decision/Voting ===

In daily lives, people usually make votes with other influences, instead of absolutely independent decision making. Let's derive another model to determine the probability of correct group decision on other influences.

Let

*&lt;math&gt; p = &lt;/math&gt; the probability of being correct

*&lt;math&gt;  C = &lt;/math&gt; the group makes the correct decision (more than half of the votes are correct)

*&lt;math&gt;  P_I = &lt;/math&gt; the probability of the influence being correct

*&lt;math&gt; \alpha =  &lt;/math&gt; the probability of the voter following the influence to make decision

*&lt;math&gt; Pr(\text{Voter votes correctly}) = (1- \alpha)p + \alpha P_I &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;  P_T = Pr(\text{Voter Correct}|\text{Influence Correct})= (1- \alpha)p + \alpha =&lt;/math&gt; the probability of the voter being correct if the influence is correct

*&lt;math&gt; P_F = Pr(\text{Voter Correct}|\text{Influence Wrong})= (1- \alpha)p =&lt;/math&gt; the probability of the voter being correct if the influence is wrong


Therefore,


&lt;math&gt; Pr(\text{Group Correct}) = Pr(\text{Influence Correct})Pr(\text{Group Correct}|\text{Influence Correct}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;+ Pr(\text{Influence Wrong})Pr(\text{Group Correct}|\text{Influence Wrong})&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; Pr(C) = P_I\sum_{k=\frac{n+1}{2}}^{n} \binom{n}{k} P_T^k (1-P_T)^{(n-k)}+(1-P_I)\sum_{k=\frac{n+1}{2}}^{n} \binom{n}{k} P_F^k (1-P_F)^{(n-k)} &lt;/math&gt;

== Central Limit Theorem ==

Let &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,...,x_n&lt;/math&gt; be a series of independently and identically distributed random variables.
The mean of these variables is &lt;math&gt; \mu_x&lt;/math&gt; and the variance is &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;y = \frac {1}{n} (x_1+x_2+...+x_n) &lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; gets larger, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; gets closer to be a random variable that is normally distributed and has mean &lt;math&gt; \mu_y = \mu_x &lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y^2 = \frac{\sigma_x^2}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">OpenClinica can export Discrepancy Notes as a CSV file, however as of version 3.x, the export causes a few problems if opened in Excel.  The problems are caused by double quotes, newlines and carriage returns in the description and detailed notes fields.  Additionally, an extra newline character causes excel to have a blank row every other row.

== Aims ==
To simply transform the content of discrepancy notes csv exports into something usable by Excel.
To do this, newlines and carriage returns in the description and detailed notes fields are removed.  Double quotes are kept, but correctly escaped, and the double newline character at the end of the line is replaced with a single newline character.

== Limitations ==
*The code below is specific to Windows, and has been tested in Windows 7.
*Windows doesn’t run unsigned PowerShell scripts, so until a signed version of the script below can be created, you have to run the commands manually. 
*Run this on the unaltered csv file downloaded from OpenClinica - don't alter or open and save the file in Excel
*Neither the output nor the input files can be open when the script is started.
*The regexps could be reimplemented in Perl under Linux.

== Instructions ==
#Alter the input and output values below to point to your desired inputfile and outputfile names (paths can be obtained from Explorer's 'location box')
#Type cmd into the Windows Start Orb search box (which opens a terminal)
#Then copy and paste the following section into the terminal (right-clicking on the terminal will open context menu from whence you can paste)
#Below the script are instructions on how to open the updated file and save it in Excel format

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Wikipedians,&lt;br /&gt;

No doubt some of you are familiar with the free college courses available on [http://Saylor.org Saylor.org]. Much like the Wikimedia community, we are committed to providing free and accessible education for everyone with internet access. At Saylor, we combine some of our custom-created educational materials with materials that are already available throughout the internet. However, because we sometimes use links to third party materials, those sections of our courses are not entirely sustainable. The Saylor Wikibooks Project is a way for you to help minimize that threat. We’ve uploaded a number of our course outlines to Wikibooks in the hope that you all will contribute to our effort. Our course outlines have been developed by our consultant professors by studying a collection of syllabi of relevant courses from various traditional brick and mortar institutions. This guarantees that our students will be provided the same learning opportunity as a student enrolled in a traditional institution. We believe that we have created the best structure for our courses, which optimizes the information that students would be expected to know. By creating openly licensed content that fits in with Saylor’s established course outlines, (in the form of Wikibooks’ textbooks), you can add to the ever-expanding body of wiki material, while simultaneously improving the sustainability of our courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for your help,&lt;br /&gt;

The Saylor Team

'''&lt;big&gt;Summary&lt;/big&gt;'''
[[File:Ringbound notebook.jpg|thumb]]
No matter what career you pursue, you must be able to communicate effectively and clearly if you plan on a successful future.  This course will enhance your ability to do so by sharpening your critical thinking and writing skills.  We will begin with a unit designed to change the way in which you think about writing.  First, you will learn to think of writing not as a solitary act but as a conversation between yourself and an audience.  In this light, writing becomes a dynamic, interactive site of creativity rather than a rote practice.  You will also begin to value writing as a process—and an admittedly difficult one—rather than a product.  You will come to see that writing is an act of discovery rather than a recitation of prefabricated ideas.

'''&lt;big&gt;Global Learning Outcomes&lt;/big&gt;'''

==Production at Common Law / O'Connor Application==
A party may apply for an order requiring a third party, that is, a party other than the crown or its agents, to produce relevant documents for the purpose of using them in court.

The application, often referred to an as &quot;O'Connor Application&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411&lt;/ref&gt;, is a two-stage process. First the applicant must satisfy the judge that the record is likely relevant to the proceedings against the accused. If so, the judge may order the production solely for the court's inspection. Second, the judge must then determine, after inspection, what portions of the documents are to be produced for the defence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. O’Connor, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frdh 1995 CanLII 51] (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. McNeil, 2009 SCC 3, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66 at para. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

An O'Connor application consists of a service of a subpoena and notice to the relevant parties.

{{Reflist|2}}
===Third Party Records vs Disclosure===
:''See also [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Disclosure#Control]]''

A third party includes Crown entities other than the prosecuting authority and so would be subject to an O'Connor application.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McNeil, 2009 SCC 3 [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66 at 13&lt;/ref&gt; This does not apply to materials that the police are under a duty to disclose to the crown as the &quot;fruits of the investigation&quot;, in which case it would constitute a first party record.&lt;ref&gt;R v McNeil&lt;/ref&gt;

Records of police investigations of third parties and police disciplinary records, usually constitutes third-party records.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McNeil,  at 25&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the the misconduct relates to the investigation or could reasonably impact on the case against the accused.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. McNeil,&lt;/ref&gt;

Records will be either in possession the Crown or a third party depending on several factors:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Coopsammy, 2008 ABQB 266&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the information is the &quot;fruits of the investigation&quot;;
# what the purpose the information was created for;
# whether the information was created or obtained as a result of, or in connection to, the specific investigation or prosecution of the accused;
# whether the information is sufficiently related to the specific investigation or prosecution
# whether there is an intrinsic link, i.e. by a factual and evidential link, to the investigation
# the nature and content of the information
# whether any third parties have a privacy interest in the information

{{Reflist|2}}

==Disclosing Specific Materials==

===Training Materials===

In advancing a violation of rights by peace officers, the training manuals applicable to the investigation are of limited relevance since they are not indicative of violations.&lt;reF&gt;R. v. Ferrari, [http://canlii.ca/t/5h4p 2001 SKQB 340] at 7;  R. v. Akinchets, [http://canlii.ca/t/fm27r 2011 SKPC 88] - considered training materials on sobriety testing&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Peace Officer Misconduct (&quot;McNeil Disclosure&quot;)===

Certain types of police misconduct records have been recommended as being treated as primary disclosure, including:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McNeil, [http://canlii.ca/t/2254d 2009 SCC 3] (CanLII), [2009] 1 SCR 66 at para. 57 - known as the &quot;Ferguson Five&quot; categories
&lt;/ref&gt;
# Any conviction or finding of guil[t] under the Canadian Criminal Code or under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act [for which a pardon has not been granted].
# Any outstanding charges under the Canadian Criminal Code or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
# Any conviction or finding of guilt under any other federal or provincial statute.
# Any finding of guilt for misconduct after a hearing under the Police Services Act or its predecessor Act.
# Any current charge of misconduct under the Police Services Act for which a Notice of Hearing has been issued.

The police have an obligation to notify the Crown of any relevant misconduct, as well as seek advice from the Crown on whether the misconduct record is relevant.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Boyne, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvgx3 2012 SKCA 124] (CanLII) at para. 34, 35
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown are to exercise a gate-keeper function with respect to the disclosure of these materials to the defence.&lt;ref&gt;
Boyne at para. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

A complex number is something that has both real and imaginary parts. So what is an imaginary number? an imaginary number is represented as j. j&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -1 so -1&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; = j. Using j all quadratics can be solved. this makes j a very powerful and usable idea. j is not a prime.

We often give complex numbers in Cartesian form &lt;math&gt; z = a + bj &lt;/math&gt;

Note: The letter j is generally used by engineers and i by mathematicians. j is used throughout this course.
==Proof==
how do you solve this: &lt;math&gt; x^2 + 1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; ?

You can rearrange into:
# &lt;math&gt; x^2 = -1 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; x = \sqrt{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

However how do we then deal with the &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{-1} &lt;/math&gt;? We do it by substituting it for a letter, j.
This works because: &lt;math&gt; (\sqrt{-1})^2 + 1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; is true which was our original equation. Therefore j is a root of this equation.

==Operations==
===Powers of j===
powers of j are very interesting and show a looping pattern.

&lt;math&gt; j^2 = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;math&gt; j^3 = -j &lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;math&gt; j^4 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;math&gt; j^5 = j &lt;/math&gt;, 

This fact can be used to simplify complex numbers.

====Questions====
Simplify
:# &lt;math&gt; j^9 &lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt; j^{22} &lt;/math&gt;

[[/solutions to powers of j questions|worked solutions]]

===Basic Operations===
These can all be easily calculated by yourself, I've just included them to show that j follows all of the rules of algebra.

Addition: &lt;math&gt; (a+bj) + (c+dj) = (a+c) + (b+d)j &lt;/math&gt; 

subtraction: &lt;math&gt; (a+bj) - (c+dj) = (a-c) + (b-d)j &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplication: &lt;math&gt; (a+bj)(c+dj) = ac + adj + bcj + bdj^2 = ac - bd + (ad + bc)j &lt;/math&gt;

Division: &lt;math&gt; (a+bj)\div(c+dj) = a\div(c+dj) + bj\div(c+dj) &lt;/math&gt;. Essentially the same but there is no real simplification.

====Question====
Evaluate
# &lt;math&gt;5j + 3j&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;7(3j)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(9+2j)(1-j) + 3 -2j&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(21 + 7j) \div 7&lt;/math&gt;

==Argand diagrams==
[[File:Argand2.png|thumb|an Argand diagram]]
Complex numbers can be plotted on an Argand diagram, with the x axis being used to represent real numbers and the y axis being used to represent the imaginary part of an equation. 

Knowledge of [[A-level Mathematics/MEI/C2/Radians|Radians]] is recommended for the next section. 

We can therefore give complex numbers in a different form, using their modulus (distance from origin) and angle (in radians). This is called polar form. &lt;math&gt; z = r(cos \theta + j sin \theta) &lt;/math&gt;.

These equations can be calculated using simple trigonometry and Pythagoras.

&lt;math&gt; r = |\sqrt{a^2+b^2}| &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \theta = tan ^{ - 1}( {b \over a} ) &lt;/math&gt;

With θ in radians and  -π &lt; θ ≤ π

You may wonder what the value of polar form is, and that's fine as it is not readily apparent. When the solutions of an equation are plotted on an Argand diagram they form a circle (and finding the equation of the circle is a common question)
The equation of a circle in this form is: &lt;math&gt; z = |r(a,b)j| &lt;/math&gt;

====Questions====
Find the polar form
:#&lt;math&gt; 20 &lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt; 12j &lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt; 4 + 3j &lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt; 12+5j &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a Microsoft Word document from a DocBook file.

== Method ==
There are two steps to building a high quality DocBook to MS-Word .docx transform.
# Create a docx generator that assembles a zip file with all the correct components
# Create a typeswitch transform that converts each DocBook element into the appropriate Open Office XML format
In this article we will create a zip file using the Microsoft [[w:Open_Packaging_Conventions|Open_Packaging_Conventions]] (OPC) format.  OPC files
can be opened with any desktop unzip program but must be created problematically to ensure that specific files are places in the correct order.  We will create several small XQuery functions that will extract key elements from the input DocBook 5 file and generate the XML files used in the Open Office XML specifications.  Then we will assemble all the components into a zip file using a single generate-docx() function.



The other transformation will follow a very similar pattern.

== Zip File Generation ==
This section shows you the process of generating a zip file using XQuery.  This depends on having a zip function that allows you to specify each of the components of the output file and specifically requires the output to be in document-order.

== The Output File Configuration ==

The output is a zip file with the following contents:
* '''[Content_Types].xml''' - a single XML file in the root directory.  This file '''MUST''' be placed first in the zip file collection.
* '''_rels''' - a folder that has a single '''.rels''' file that is an XML file with releationships between files
* '''docProps''' - a folder that has the document properies files in it.  These are usually the app.xml and core.xml files
* '''word''' - a folder with all the word content and two subfolders.  Typical content includes:
** _rels folder with a single file such as document.xml.rels in it
** theme folder with a single file such as theme1.xml in it
** document.xml
** fontTable.xml
** settings.xml
** styles.xml
** webSettings.xml

== Sample Use of Zip Function ==
The compression:zip( $entries, true() ) function takes two parameters.  The first is a series of &lt;entries&gt; elements, one for each
file or collection we are going to create.

Here is the entry for building the main '''[Content_Types].xml''' file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entry name=&quot;[Content_Types].xml&quot; type=&quot;xml&quot; method=&quot;store&quot;&gt;{doc(concat($db2docx:template-collection, '/content-types-template.xml'))}&lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The following is an example of how we put a file in the _rels folder with the .rels file name:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entry name=&quot;_rels/.rels&quot; type=&quot;xml&quot; method=&quot;store&quot;&gt;{doc(concat($db2docx:template-collection, '/dot-rels.xml'))}&lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

So to build a docx file we &quot;assemble&quot; each of the &lt;entry&gt; elements using the compression:zip() function and then return the binary stream to the web browser with the correct mime type and file name.  This file is downloaded and you can then open it with MS word.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function db2docx:generate-docx($docbook-input-document as node(), $filename as xs:string) {

(: this has a sequence of &lt;entry&gt; elements that is used by the zip function :)
    let $entries :=
        (
        db2docx:content-type-entry(),
        ...
        db2docx:root-rels())
    return
        (
        response:set-header(&quot;Content-Disposition&quot;, concat(&quot;attachment; filename=&quot;, concat($filename, '.docx')))
        ,
        response:stream-binary(
            compression:zip( $entries, true() ),
            'application/zip',
            concat($filename, '.docx')
            )
        )
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Mapping DocBook 5 Elements to Open Office XML ==

DocBook files are very easy to work with since the entire document can be stored in a single file.  DocX has many small files
and these files are stored in many different locations in the zip archive.

Here are some examples:

=== Core Properties ===
The Core Properties element are the standard [[w:Dublin Core|Dublin Core]] metadata elements that you might see in a bibliographic entry for a book or article.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;cp:coreProperties xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot; xmlns:dcmitype=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/&quot; xmlns:dcterms=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&quot; xmlns:cp=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/metadata/core-properties&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;

    &lt;dc:description&gt;How to convert DocBook to DocX&lt;/dc:description&gt;
    &lt;cp:lastModifiedBy&gt;Dan McCreary&lt;/cp:lastModifiedBy&gt;
    &lt;cp:revision&gt;1&lt;/cp:revision&gt;
    &lt;dcterms:created xsi:type=&quot;dcterms:W3CDTF&quot;&gt;2012-05-04T13:35:00Z&lt;/dcterms:created&gt;
    &lt;dcterms:modified xsi:type=&quot;dcterms:W3CDTF&quot;&gt;2012-05-04T13:35:00Z&lt;/dcterms:modified&gt;
&lt;/cp:coreProperties&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Application Properties ===
Here is an example of an XQuery function that will fill in the number of sections in the application properties XML file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function db2docx:app-properties($docbook-input-document as node()) {
&lt;Properties xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/extended-properties&quot; 
   xmlns:vt=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/docPropsVTypes&quot;&gt;
    &lt;SectionCount&gt;{count($docbook-input-document//sect1)}&lt;/SectionCount&gt;
    &lt;Application&gt;DocBook 5 to Microsoft Open Office XML (DocX) Converter by Dan McCreary of Kelly-McCreary &amp;amp; Associates&lt;/Application&gt;
    &lt;DocSecurity&gt;0&lt;/DocSecurity&gt;
    &lt;Lines&gt;1&lt;/Lines&gt;
    &lt;Paragraphs&gt;1&lt;/Paragraphs&gt;
    &lt;ScaleCrop&gt;false&lt;/ScaleCrop&gt;
    &lt;Company&gt;Kelly-McCreary &amp;amp; Associates&lt;/Company&gt;
    &lt;LinksUpToDate&gt;false&lt;/LinksUpToDate&gt;
    &lt;CharactersWithSpaces&gt;12&lt;/CharactersWithSpaces&gt;
    &lt;SharedDoc&gt;false&lt;/SharedDoc&gt;
    &lt;HyperlinksChanged&gt;false&lt;/HyperlinksChanged&gt;
    &lt;AppVersion&gt;0.1&lt;/AppVersion&gt;
&lt;/Properties&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Document Body Element Transforms ===

Mapping your DocBook elements into Open Office XML format will vary depending on what DocBook elements you use and what your Word template structure is.  This tutorial example will demonstrate mapping for the following elements:
# article
# article title
# sect1
# sect 1 title
# para
# figure

=== Sample DocBook 5 Input File ===
We will begin with a DocBook 5 chatper with a two level 1 sections that each have two level two subsections each with two paragraphs each.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;chapter xmlns=&quot;http://docbook.org/ns/docbook&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot; version=&quot;5.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Chapter Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;subtitle&gt;Chapter Subtitle&lt;/subtitle&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;This is the body introductory text of the chapter&lt;/para&gt;
    &lt;sect1&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Level 1 Title 1&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;subtitle&gt;Section 1 Subtitle&lt;/subtitle&gt;
        &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the first level 1 article section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the first level 1 article section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;sect2&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Level 2 Title 1.1&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the first level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the first level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;/sect2&gt;
        &lt;sect2&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Level 2 Title 1.2&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the second level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the second level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;/sect2&gt;        
    &lt;/sect1&gt;
    &lt;sect1&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Level 1 Title 2&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;subtitle&gt;Section 1 Subtitle&lt;/subtitle&gt;
        &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the first level 1 article section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the first level 1 article section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;sect2&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Section 2 Title 2.1&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the first level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the first level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;/sect2&gt;
        &lt;sect2&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Section 2 Title 2.2&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the second level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the second level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;/sect2&gt;
        
    &lt;/sect1&gt;
&lt;/chapter&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Document Body ===
Open Office XML uses a complex XML structure for storing the body of text.  Paragraphs are broken up into &quot;runs&quot; and then have text within those run elements.  The following structure is an example of this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;w:document xmlns:wp=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/wordprocessingDrawing&quot; 
    xmlns:o=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; 
    xmlns:m=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/math&quot; 
    xmlns:wne=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/word/2006/wordml&quot; 
    xmlns:w10=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word&quot; 
    xmlns:w=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main&quot; 
    xmlns:v=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml&quot; 
    xmlns:r=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships&quot; 
    xmlns:ve=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006&quot;&gt;
    &lt;w:body&gt;
        &lt;w:p&gt;
            &lt;w:r&gt;
                &lt;w:t&gt;Hello World!&lt;/w:t&gt;
            &lt;/w:r&gt;
        &lt;/w:p&gt;
    &lt;/w:body&gt;
&lt;/w:document&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Creating Your Typeswitch Transform ===

We are now ready to dive into the element by element transform.

The structure looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function db2docx:main($content as node()*) as item()* {
    for $node in $content
    (: let $log := util:log-system-out(concat('In main with ', count($node//node()), ' elements')) :)
    return 
        typeswitch($node)
            case text() return $node
            
            (:
            case element(article) return db2h:article($node)
            case element(book) return db2h:book($node) :)

            (: each of these is responsible for handling its own title, paragraphs and subsections :)
            case element(db:chapter) return db2docx:chapter($node)
            case element(db:sect1) return db2docx:sect1($node)
            case element(db:sect2) return db2docx:sect2($node)
....
           default return db2docx:null()
}; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Mapping your DocBook elements into Open Office XML format will vary depending on what DocBook elements you use and what your Word template structure is.  This tutorial example will demonstrate mapping for the following elements:
# article
# article title
# sect1
# sect 1 title
# para
# figure
# etc

=== Sample Recursive Function ===
The main &quot;dispatch&quot; function will arrive at the node of every high-level element.  It will then just to the function specifically associated with that element.  Usually the function has the same name as the element.

At each level of the transform you put in the data elements you need and then call the main function for each sub-element.  This allows you to specifically put in structure that you know exists and avoids having to look up the context of an element depending on where you are in the tree.  For example the title element is used consistently in the chapter, sect1 and sect2 sections.  You can lookup the parent element name when you get to the title element but it is often easier just to put in the elements within the section you have just arrived at.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function db2docx:sect1($sect1 as node()) as node()* {
(
    &lt;!-- sect1 --&gt;,
    &lt;w:p&gt;
        &lt;w:pPr&gt;
            &lt;w:pStyle w:val=&quot;Heading1&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/w:pPr&gt;
        &lt;w:r&gt;
            &lt;w:t&gt;{$sect1/db:title/text()}&lt;/w:t&gt;
        &lt;/w:r&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Sample Output ===

=== Adding Images ===
==== DocBook Figures ====
DocBook figures have the following sample structure:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Figure Caption&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;mediaobject&gt;
      &lt;imageobject&gt;
           &lt;imagedata fileref=&quot;images/my-image.png&quot; scale=&quot;50&quot; contentwidth=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/imageobject&gt;
   &lt;/mediaobject&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
In the sample above we store all images for an article in an images collection directly in the collection that stores the main article XML file.  We also scale the image
to 50% of its original size or set the content width to be a fixed number of pixels.

==== Sample Open Office Image ====
Below is the equivalant structure of an image in docx format:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/wp:inline&gt;
&lt;/w:drawing&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The binary images must be placed in the word/media collection.

=== Revision Identifiers (RSIDS) ===
Microsoft documents also have a large number of revision attributes or &quot;RSIDS&quot; for each paragraph, run and text.  These are used when there are multiple authors making changes and the changes must be tracked using a revision reviewing system.  Buy assigning random ID numbers to each component of text it is easier for a person to view the tracked changes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;w:p w:rsidR=&quot;00D910F7&quot; w:rsidRDefault=&quot;00CB02EF&quot; w:rsidP=&quot;00CB02EF&quot;&gt;
   &lt;w:pPr&gt;
      &lt;w:pStyle w:val=&quot;Title&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/w:pPr&gt;
      &lt;w:r&gt;
         &lt;w:t&gt;Document Title&lt;/w:t&gt;
      &lt;/w:r&gt;
&lt;/w:p&gt;
&lt;w:p w:rsidR=&quot;00CB02EF&quot; w:rsidRDefault=&quot;00CB02EF&quot; w:rsidP=&quot;00CB02EF&quot;&gt;
   &lt;w:pPr&gt;
      &lt;w:pStyle w:val=&quot;Heading1&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/w:pPr&gt;
      &lt;w:r&gt;
         &lt;w:t&gt;I am heading&lt;/w:t&gt;
      &lt;/w:r&gt;
&lt;/w:p&gt;
&lt;w:p w:rsidR=&quot;00CB02EF&quot; w:rsidRDefault=&quot;00CB02EF&quot;&gt;
   &lt;w:r&gt;
      &lt;w:t&gt;This is the body text for a paragraph.&lt;/w:t&gt;
   &lt;/w:r&gt;
&lt;/w:p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can disable the generation of the RSIDs by going to the Microsoft Word Options and then to the Trust Center and then Select &quot;Privacy Settings&quot; (although this has nothing to do with privacy) and the UNcheck the &quot;Store random number to improve Combine accuracy&quot;

== '''A. Introduction ==
== A1.	Electronic transitions and luminescence''' ==
Luminescence is the emission of light due to transitions of electrons from molecular orbitals of higher energy to those of lower energy, usually the ground state or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. Such transitions are referred to as relaxations. Figure A1.1 shows four electronic energy levels (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,  S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and the possible transitions between them. S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; represents the ground state, while S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represent higher-energy excited states;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are singlet states in which all the electrons form pairs of opposed spins whereas T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a triplet excited state, in which not all electrons are paired off in this way. 


[[File:Jablonski diagram.jpg|600px|center]]


Figure A1.1 – Jablonski diagram showing four electronic energy levels S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, with their vibrational fine structure and the transitions between them that affect luminescence. 

Each energy level is subdivided into a number of vibrational states, each characterised by an amount of vibrational energy that accompanies the potential energy of the electrons occupying the orbitals. 
Luminescence is classified according to the excited state that gives rise to it and to the source of the energy that caused the excited state to be populated with electrons. The promotion of electrons to an excited state is called excitation. In many cases, this is brought about by absorption of visible or ultraviolet radiation. In such a case, if the luminescence arises because electrons are relaxing from a singlet excited state to a singlet ground state, then it is called '''fluorescence''', and generally occurs within 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; s. The transition is very fast because it involves no reversal of electron spin. If, however, it arises due to relaxation from a triplet excited state, then the luminescence is called '''phosphorescence''', which generally occurs within 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; to 100 s. If the excitation is the result of energy released in a chemical reaction, the luminescence is called '''chemiluminescence'''. A subset of chemiluminescence occurring in the biosphere as a result of biological processes is called '''bioluminescence'''. '''Electrochemiluminescence''' is another distinct subset of chemiluminescence phenomena, made up of those reactions in which the excited species is produced at an electrode during electrolysis. 

Before luminescence occurs, there is a non-radiative loss of energy (due to collisions between molecules) as the excited state relaxes to a lower vibrational state while remaining at the same electronic energy level. This type of transition is called '''vibrational deactivation'''. It has to occur even more rapidly than fluorescence and typically occurs within 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; s of excitation. Therefore the luminescence involves the emission of photons of lower energy (higher wavelength) than would otherwise be the case. Another possible transition is '''internal conversion''', in which an electron transfers from a lower vibrational state of a higher electronic energy level to a higher vibrational state of a lower electronic energy level, without any significant gain or loss of energy; such a transition, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, is shown schematically in Figure 1.1. In '''intersystem crossing''', internal conversion would involve also reversal of the spin of the electron as in a transition from a singlet to a triplet state; the transition S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in Figure 1.1 is of this type. Such transitions can give rise to phosphorescence. Finally, luminescence is not inevitable. The intensity of the emission compared with the number of molecules in the excited state is called the '''quantum yield'''(Φ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;). This can be calculated for fluorescent emission by dividing the number of emitted photons by the number of absorbed photons. Φ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; in a chemiluminescence phenomenon should be the same as in the fluorescence phenomenon involving the same excited state, but, because chemiluminescence does not depend on the absorption of photons, it can be calculated in the same way only by performing a separate fluorescence experiment. 
The intensity of chemiluminescence emission is more meaningfully compared with the number of reactant molecules; this measure is called the '''chemiluminescence quantum yield''' (Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt;). It is related to Φ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; by the equation:

                                    Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt; = Φ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;.Φ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;.Φ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;

where Φ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of reactant molecules converted into product and Φ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of product molecules formed in the excited state.  Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt; has values from 0 to 1 and reaches 0.88 for firefly luciferin ''in vitro''&lt;ref&gt;Seliger H H and McElroy W D, Pathways of energy transfer in bioluminescence, ''Radiation Res.'', Suppl. 2 (1960), 528-38. 
&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Because Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt; depends on Φ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; it would be reasonable to suppose that chemiluminescence is affected by substitution in product molecules in the same way as is fluorescence. In that case, Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt; would be increased by electron donors and decreased by electron acceptors. There would also be an increase in Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt; (and a bathochromic shift in emission wavelength) due to conjugated systems and in rigidly planar molecules having facilitated π-bond delocalisation. Such generalisations must be used with great care, for the only product species to which they can apply are the molecules that are actually emitting; it is by no means obvious what these are in any particular case.

== Book structure ==

I've renamed your book to our normal style so it isn't all in capital letters. It is now here [[Analytical Chemiluminescence]]. I've also moved the subpage into the book. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 23:15, 4 May 2012 (UTC)

The structure used here is to have every chapter of the book &quot;indented&quot; below the main page. This is done by naming the subpages like this:
:Main page named &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My Book]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:All chapters named &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My Book/Chapter One]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

You can refer to the chapters by using a &quot;relative link&quot; from the main page like this &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Chapter One/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Don't worry if you make any mistakes, someone will fix them. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 23:23, 4 May 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Preference Reversal is the situation in which preferences for bundles are shifted after the options are juxtaposed.  When bundles are valued separately the decision made on the bundle is different than when they are valued jointly.  This is due to the relativity of choices.  
&quot;Relativity is easy to understand, but there's one aspect of relativity that consistently trips us up.  It's this: we not only tend to compare things with one another, but also tend to focus on comparing things that are easily comparable- and avoid comparing things that cannot be easily compared.&lt;ref&gt;Ariely, Dan. Predictably Irrational. 1. 14-16. eBook. &lt;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:qcvxxsVgUDMJ:xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/1048630/1548442734/name/predictably+irrational+dan+ariely.docx &amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj9QqE8_iAefamN1Ee5NqC-0nsh2Va0DiEuX-w926Bee2k1myh7NuC8tViXtzMeh69mavzulbsTP0nTzciFHeUTKvqymlAfyBk7o68uF5rOWasfDDM2UbQoNO1deE9Axv2P1yfL&amp;sig=AHIEtbSGrCYX941_p0i6B2ik_EgTrw5Zag&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;
This is the reason that people tend to change preferences when comparing things separately and jointly.  Comparisons become easier once juxtaposed, and more important attributes can be easily compared.
Preference Reversal is a theory opposite of the theory of riskless choice.  Riskless choice is a theory created by Jeremy Bentham and James Mill that states that decision makers reach utility maximizing choices through consistent and stable choices.  Preference Reversal theory however, states that optimal choices might not exist even with the most simple of choices when preferences are contingent on circumstance and whims.  When uncertainty is introduced into the decision making process, the theory of consistent and stable preferences is contradicted.  Preference reversals have been noted in a number of settings, but have largely been ignored by economists as many believe that preference reversals are wiped out in marketplace settings.  A study by John A. List has proven the opposite however, as he has taken to the marketplace to prove the existence of preference reversals&lt;ref name=List2012&gt;List, John. &quot;Preference Reversals of a Different Kind: The &quot;More Is Less&quot; Phenomenon.&quot; 92.5 n. page. Web. 4 May. 2012. &lt;http://karlan.yale.edu/fieldexperiments/uploads/PreferenceReversalsofaDifferentKind.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.
Preference Reversals violate the theory of the weak axiom of revealed preference.  WARP states that if bundle A is strictly preferred to bundle B, and the two bundles are not the same, then it cannot be true that bundle B is directly revealed preferred to bundle A.  When presented relative to other goods however, we can see a preference reversal due to relativity&lt;ref&gt;Varian, Hal. Intermediate Microeconomics. 8. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 124. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Marketplace Application==
	John List has conducted a study using the marketplace for sports trading cards to prove the existence of the “more is less” phenomenon, a name used to describe preference reversals.  Professor List attended a trading card showcase to observe market behavior of experienced and non-experienced card enthusiasts.  He offered four bundles of cards for sale.  The first was ten excellent condition trading cards worth a total of $15, which he auctioned off.  The second bundle was the exact same ten cards, plus three “poor” condition cards worth $18, which he auctioned off as well.  In the third bundle, he auctioned off the exact same two sets of cards side by side.  In the fourth bundle, he had customers pay him $5 to choose which set of cards they wanted.  What List finds is that when bid on separately, consumers bid higher on the ten card bundle rather than the 13 card bundle, even though the 13 card bundle is worth $3 more than the ten card bundle.  When the two bundles are juxtaposed, consumers bid higher on the 13 card bundle, showing a reversal of preference.  This phenomenon can be see using non-dealers, who are in-experienced, and also holds true for the dealers, who are considered extremely experienced in this field.  List goes on to conclude that when individuals bid on one item in isolation, easy to evaluate characteristics, not necessarily the most important ones are used to determine value.  When bid on jointly in a juxtaposition, bundles are judged compared to the other bundle, and reference characteristics are better defined allowing consumers to make utility maximizing choices&lt;ref name=List2012/&gt;.
==Joint vs. Separate Evaluation==
	There are two types of evaluations seen in the Preference Reversal theory.  These evaluations are Joint Evaluation and Separate Evaluation, in which drastically different choices are made depending on the type of evaluation being done.  Joint Evaluation is the situation in which multiple options are presented at the same time and the consumer can make decisions based upon comparison to the other options.  This type of evaluation usually leads to better decisions and less consumer error.  Separate Evaluation is the situation in which consumers are presented one option at a time and evaluated in isolation from other options.  This type of evaluation draws on consumers references and is affected by uncertainty, leading to consumer error&lt;ref name=HseeEtAl1999&gt;Hsee, Christopher, Sally Blount, George Loewenstein, and Max Bazerman. &quot;Preference Reversals Between Joint and Separate Evaluations of Options: A Review and Theoretical Analysis.&quot; American Psychological Association. 125.5 (1999): n. page. Web. 4 May. 2012. &lt;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gl20/GeorgeLoewenstein/Papers_files/pdf/PrefRevJoint.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  
==Evaluating Attributes==
	Some attributes, most notably measurable attributes such as GPA, IQ, or other scores, are easy to independently evaluate, and other attributes such as job experience or how many programs a candidate has written are more difficult to independently evaluate.  In Separate Evaluation, the attributes that are difficult to evaluate have less impact on the overall choice or decision.  In Separate Evaluation, easy to evaluate attributes hold more weight and are the primary determinants of the final decision.  In Joint Evaluation however, options can be compared side by side and the difficult to evaluate attributes become easier to evaluate, exerting greater influence over the final decision.  Easy to evaluate attributes do not play a large role in Joint Evaluation, as they can even be evaluated in the Separate Evaluation mode and are of no use when difficult to evaluate attributes can be used.  This leads to preference reversal as the impact of the different attributes change when using Joint Evaluation as opposed to Separate Evaluation&lt;ref name=HseeEtAl1999/&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=ChoirWire=
is a scalable, fault tolerant, distributed digital sound mixer system especially for life concert purposes. It is a definition for a low cost system with good performance and the possibility of high channel count. Goal is not to define state of the art. (Distributed audio mixers which are coupled via optical high speed communication are on the market for a few mio. Dollars.)

'''Aim of the project is to define an open standard for the physical and logical data layer so that different hardware and software projects worldwide by students or professionals can be established and work together.'''

This KISS-standard shall be suitable for a stage audio system with 2-512 input channels, two main and up to four distributed monitor outputs and one remote mixing console. Every distributed input has its own adjustable logical address (0-255) on which it is identified. It doesn’t care on which socket an input is plugged in. 
The amount of data shall not be too high so that standard components with low cost can be used. Nevertheless a data main stream of 2x23bit is foreseen to make high quality as well possible as single chip solutions.


[[File:ChoirWire UseCase1.gif]]

Fig.1: Example of Use-Case of ChoirWire standard

=Main principle=

A standard mixing console consists of several input channels. After tone adjustment, the sound of every channel is put on cross bars of main L/R and monitor channels with different volumes. After all, there is a master volume for main and monitor channels.
Every input wire is routed in parallel to the mixing console. Monitor channels are routed back to the stage or musician. A lot of wires are required if there are more than a douzend musicians.


[[File:ChoirWire_standardMixingConsole.gif]]

Fig. 2: Classic sound mixing console

To get rid of the wiring horror it would be nice to put all the information of input and output on one wire which collects the inputs and distributes the outputs from and to everywhere. But the problem doing so is, that there is a very huge amount of data. Having 64 input channels with 2x24bits (main)+ 4x12bits (monitor) and sampling rate of 48ksamples/s means a pay load of 294.912Mbit/s. Might be possible – but difficult and expensive to handle. Data reduction is undesired for professional music equipment.

The solution for low real-time data rate without loss of quality is to transfer the Xbars, not the inputs directly. The input channels are put on the stage, the “knobs” are remote controlled. Additionally, if the inputs are already on stage near the musicians, the transfer of the monitor channels (for example for in-ear monitors) is possible.

=Definition of the ChoirWire standard=
==Physical layer==

The data transport consists of a bidirectional, redundant ring system. 


[[File:ChoirWire_PrincipleBidirectionalDataTransport.gif]]

Fig.4: Principle of bidirectional data transport

It carries main audio data, monitor audio data and status data from the distributed inputs to the data collector and audio data and control data from a data collector to the distributed inputs.

One input will be the first who receives data from both sides. He will ignore one side and send his data to the other because the received data is redundant. 
If the flow of control and music data fails, the previous ignored side will be checked for valid data. With this mechanism it is possible to detect single defects – and blank them out!

The audio data shall be at 48kHz sampling rate. A Codec needs 256*48kHz = 12.288Mhz bus clock. It shall be possible to find an UART working with 6144 kBaud bus clock with a standard 8 bit coding. So 12 Bytes per frame can be used: 3 left main 3 right main, 6 monitor. 

Beside of the data, the distributed inputs are supplied with DC voltage of 48V. This makes it necessary to use DC/DC converter modules in the inputs, but reduces the current flowing over the supply wire. If necessary, more than one power supply in the physical ring can be used in parallel to power the inputs.



[[File:ChoirWire_DataAndPowerFlowOnStage.gif]]

Fig. 5: Power and data flow in a distributed system

==Connector system==

The practical implementation of a ring is rather nasty and not suitable for a quick on-stage installation. Nevertheless, only the ring is really fault tolerant against broken wires.

A single wire with a simple plug which can be plugged-in somewhere on the stage and the connection is always correct is much easier to use as a double connected ring.

The compromise: Stage boxes (as many as required) are connected as a ring, the distributed inputs are connected to them. Even more, chains of distributed inputs shall be possible.

===Sockets and connectors for distributed inputs===
For keeping the data ring closed it is necessary to have female connections which have bypass switches: With the connector plugged in, the physical ring is looped-through the input, without connector, the physical ring is closed. 
Short circuits during plugging would disturb data flow or, even worse, brake down supply and reset the whole system which will lead to audible black outs. 
One connection system which fulfils the needs of bypass switch and shortcut free plugging is the German TAE analogue telephone connection (see Wikipedia TAE connector). (The Austrian telephone sockets have more pins, so redundancy for power supply would be possible. But often they have not all contacts (Only 6) - and they are more expensive.)

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:TAE-Stecker-F.jpg|Fig. 6: TAE connector
File:TAE-Dose-NFF-UP.jpg|Fig.7: TAE socket
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The TAE socket has 6 contacts. Contacts 1-6 and 2-5 are closed via switch in the female connector if no connector is plugged in. Contacts 3-4 don’t have this feature. The contacts are not gold plated – but for a short-term use like on-stage there is no time for oxidation. And the plugs are not too small and sensitive, the cable outlet is protected – even more suitable for use on-stage. The coding “F” shall be used.
(other connectors? Well, there must be a bypass switch, so the USA telephone or network sockets don’t work. Nevertheless, better solutions are welcome.)

Very important in this system is ground and supply. Pin 3 has positive 48V, Pin 4 is connected to ground.
The two signal wire pairs on Pin 1/2 and 5/6 are used bidirectional. So it is possible to detect a broken link and use the other signal path. 
If the distributed inputs are equipped with a socket (to create chains) it is necessary to change the signal direction (left side of the ring – right side of the ring). So every two inputs the signal is repeated – and not only bypassed a lot of times. This enhances signal transfer stability even in long chains because the inputs act as a signal repeater. 

Shielded cables are necessary for the interconnection. 
Proposal: symmetrical network wires with a RF impedance of 100 ohms are used.
Between stage box and input, a 4 pair network wire may be used: 2 pairs for data communication, the others for supply.
May be an USB 3.0 wire (with 3 pairs plus supply wires) is also suitable, but it has an impedance of 90 Ohms.

===Sockets and connectors for the stage boxes===

The stage boxes consist mainly from the telephone standard socket “F F”, which has 2 outlets. Two connectors can be plugged in. With the standard “NFN” telephone socket, pin 3 and 4 cannot be accessed seperately for adding (PTC-) fuses. Only the single “F” and the double “F F“ socket give this possibility. (In fact, it is possible to cut off the coding nozzle from the connector – and then it is possible to use N or F connector in N or F sockets).

The data transfer from and to the data collector shall be done via 100 ohms network wires. Only one pair is required - so the other three may carry the 48V supply. Alternatively, a 1 pair network wire and a 1 pair supply wire with large copper diameter may be used.

The power lines are critical to short circuits, so a reasonable distance between 48V and GND is necessary. Having up to 254 distributed inputs with a power consumption of 2W each will result in a total power consumption of 508W. So, the power lines in the stage box ring have to withstand up to 10.6A. The telephone “F” connectors are limited to about 0.5A. For protection against overload, PTC resistors (poly switch fuse) shall be used in the stage box to limit the output current to 0.5A. So the length of every input chain (power consumption 2W each) is limited to 12. The number of stage boxes is not limited.
For power connection and data XLR-connectors with 4 poles are recommended. (Better solutions are welcome.) 
Pin 4 (near marking) is used as GND, pins 2+3 are used for data, and pin 1 carries 48V. So, the distance between GND and 48V is maximum.

Fig. 11: Example of the wiring diagram of the ChoirWire

==Electrical data transmission and reception==
The data wires are used bidirectional. So the transceiver has to blank-out his own sent signal analogue. Even more, it is recommended to use a magnetic transformer. So together with galvanic isolated DC/CD converters (48V to 5V) it is easy to make the distributed inputs galvanic isolated. Disturbances from mains will be reduced to a minimum.
The data transfer rate will be 48kHz * 128bits = 6.144MBit, so the necessary band with of the transformer is (6.144MBit / 10Bits/byte =) 614kHz to (6.144MBit/2Bit * 5 =) 15.36 MHz.  (at least 6.144MBit/2Bit*3 = 9.216MHz).
For eliminating the DC offset, a kind of &quot;Alternate mark&quot; RZ coding is used. In an UART-like communication the idle level on the signal wire is high, the active level is low. So a &quot;silent&quot; line is high (idle) for the UART, means that there are no transmission pulses on the communication wire.

[[Image:Ami encoding.svg|thumb|360px|An example of bipolar encoding, or AMI (Alternate mark inversion).]]

Implementation example:
The generation of an alternating signal is done with a divider (D-FlipFlop), which flips at every sent low signal. Disadvantage is, that the transmission clock is needed. A standard SPI output of a micro controller can do this.
With a tristate line driver and three resistors, the three voltage levels are generated. In tristate (SPI-TX signal high), a medium voltage is applied to the transceiver amp. If the SPI-TX signal is low, the flip flop level is output.
The transceiver shall output the serial signal with an impedance of about 90 Ohms.  Because of the wire and receiver impedance and the output swing of a video amplifier, the voltage swing on the signal wire is 1Vpp. An differential amplifier is mixing the transmitted and received signal to the receive channel so that the own sent signal is eliminated. 
A window comparator circuit (with small hysteresis) detects a &quot;voltage around zero&quot; (&lt;40% of input swing) of a &quot;voltage present&quot; (&gt;60% of input swing). Via OR (here with diodes and pullup), a UART compatible signal for the micro is generated to receive data.

Fig. 12: Transceiver example


==Logical data transfer==

There are two data directions: &lt;br /&gt;
-	the Control &amp; monitor data from the Data collector to the distributed inputs and &lt;br /&gt;
-	the Status &amp; music data from the distributed slaves to the data collector.

===Data transfer ===
This description is valid for both directions: From inputs to data collector and vice versa.

There are 128 bit times for data transmission in one 48kHz cycle. So 12 Bytes with 1start bit, 1stop bit and 8 data bytes can be transmitted, 

LSB first (standard UART).&lt;br /&gt;

The distributed inputs receive the music data (main and monitor) from the predecessor and add their own music data to it.
The transmission starts with the LSB first. So it is possible to reduce the delay to one bittime per distributed input, if a logic device is 

used: Receive the LSB from the previous input, add own LSB, and send it out.
(Example: data rate 48kHz * 128bits = 6144kb/s --&gt; Bittime is 0.1627µs = Delay per input --&gt; 41.65µs delay for 256 inputs archeivable.)
 
The data collector adds the music data from the left and the right physical ring and has then the complete music data. 
The complete music data are then sent back via the two signal wires to the physical ring.
So, everywhere in the net, the reception of the main mix output and 2-4 monitor channels is possible. (&quot;Virual x-bars&quot;)

To give a maximum of flexibility to quality, four transmission modes are selectable:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Mode !! main channels !! monitor channels !! sum of channels
|-
| 0 (default) || 16bit L, 16bit R || 2x15bit, 2x16bit|| 6 channels
|-
| 1  || 23bit L, 23bit R || 2x24bit|| 4 channels
|-
| 2  || 23bit L, 23bit R || 3x16bit|| 5 channels
|-
| 3  || 23bit L, 23bit R || 4x12bit|| 6 channels
|} 

Within the music data, two control bits are integrated.
So 96kBits control data per second can be transmitted.
It is mandatory, that the data bits have allways the same position.
After Reset, when the mode is not known, the main channels are used with 16bits with. The monitor channels need a few milliseconds.
The monitor channels are ignored (no signal output) until the input has received a configuration command (7).

===Data transfer with the two data bits 1+2===
Prior goal is to transfer music and not to transfer unnecessary data. So this 96kB/s is used as an asynchronous data transfer:
The data stream consists of the content of consecutive data bits D1-D2-D1-D2-D1-D2-D1-D2 and so on.
The idle state is logic‘1’.  A data transfer is started by a start bit transition to ‘0’. Then the 8 bit data content is sent byte by byte, LSB 

first, to simulate a standard UART protocol.
So it is easy to route the transmitted/received data bits to general IO ports where they can be received/transmitted by other standard UARTs.
For adjusting all possible 256 inputs with a new volume value and letting 10Bits sync pause, this will take (256 x 40Bits ./. 96kBit/s = ) 

107ms. This is fast enough, especially if only the inputs in use are addressed.

|}


The data from the predecessor have to be buffered in the inputs to avoid data collisions due to transfer times. If a data transfer from the predecessor is running, the input must wait with the transmission of its data. If an input is transferring status data, the data of the predecessor is buffered in a FIFO buffer.
Also the data collector has to buffer the data coming from the left or right arm of the physical ring. The data to inputs are longer (3Bytes) than the feedback data (2Byes). So there is enough time to transmit all the data – but buffers are needed to handle collisions due to delay times.

===Start of communication and synchronisation===

The communication starts from the data collector in both directions (left and right ring arm).
Because the idle phase of the data stream is shorter than a byte, every 2nd frame is sent only.

[[File:ChoirWire_Synchronisation1.gif]]

Fig.15: Sync step 1

If the start of communication is recognized correctly, the music data is sent back with half speed. So, the Data collector (or precedent distributed input) can synchronize.

[[File:ChoirWire_Synchronisation2.gif]]

Fig.16: Sync step 2

If and as long the Data collector has correct communication, he starts sending every frame.
If there has been silence on the other side of input 2,3, it starts transmitting the control flow for the next input block.

[[File:ChoirWire_Synchronisation3.gif]]

Fig.17: Sync step 3

Because of the full speed transmission of the Data collector, the input 2 and 3 send back with full speed.
The Input1will receive data from both side, so no “idle side” is found. It has to decide for one direction. The first correct received frame will fix this.
The time difference may come from line delay or program sequence. In this example the left ring was first.

[[File:ChoirWire_Synchronisation4.gif]]

Fig.18: Sync step 4

For Input 1, there is correct data on both sides, so it knows that the ring is closed.
After receiving the control data with full speed, it sends back to the left side only, but also with full speed.

The state transitions of sync and data transfer as state chart:

[[File:ChoirWire_StateTransitionDiagram.gif]]

Fig.20: state transition diagram
*“Data received” means a full 12 byte frame received without stopbit errors.

===Mixing console data transfer===
For the data transfer from the data collector to the mixing console, a standard audio wire with 3 pin XLR connectors can be used. Alternative, Sub-D connectors with 9 pins are provided so a RS232 null modem cable can be used.

Fig.21: XLR connector     Fig.22: RS232 null modem cable

The female connector is on the mixing console, the male connector in the data collector. Pin 1 is connected to ground, pin 2 is used for data transfer from mixing console to data collector, Pin 3 for data transfer from data collector to mixing console.

Sub-D 9pin male on data collector:
Pin 5 is connected to ground, pin 2 is RX and used for data transfer from mixing console to data collector, pin 3 is TX and used for data transfer from the data collector to mixing console. 

The simple RS232 levels shall be used there for the 96kBaud signals with the known standard levels. So a laptop (with USB to COM adaptor) can be used as mixing console as a software solution. 
For a better handling, a mixing console with buttons and slider will be more suitable on stage to control the distributed inputs.

==Conformity to ChoirWire standard==
Items which are 100% compatible with this ChoirWire standard must fulfill this minimum requirements:

===for distributed inputs===
* The input voltage range is 40V...50V minimum
* All mechanical, physical and data transport methods are conform

===for data collectors===
* The nominal output voltage is 48V
* All mechanical, physical and data transport methods are conform
* Commands from the remote mixing console to the inputs and vice versa are not filtered


=Appendix=
==Example of a mixing console==

[[File:ChoirWire_ExampleMixingConsole.gif]]

fig. 23: Example of a mixing console

This example shows a possible mixing console with the possibilities in a certain situation:
On the left side there are 24 (of possible 256) input selectors/displays. On each there is the input number and a “solo” button / lamp on which the channel (here 10) has more volume (Solo add). Then the level indicator chain of the input and – the most important thing- a selection button in several colours:
If it is off, then the input is not connected in the physical ring.
If it is green, the input is present and OK, but is not selected.
If it is red, the input has encountered a problem – for example, a bad wire.
If it is yellow, the input is selected. Pushing the input button selects this input, pushing a “Group” button selects the group – and all the inputs assigned to this group are yellow. In this example, group 2 was selected. The inputs 20, 21, 22 and 23 (for example 4 sopranos) are assigned to that group and are yellow. Now the selection buttons (selection volume, selection pitch/balance, selection bass / mid / treble, Monitor 1,2,3,4) will adjust the sound levels of the whole soprano group.
If only one input is selected, the selection buttons adjust the sound of this input.
The master volume left and right can be adjusted in every setting.

Here an example for calculating the volume of one  channel:
Input 12: 
Volume left = Volume(12) + balanceL(12)+[solo(12) if active]+Volume(group2)+
balanceL(group2)+MasterVolumeL  
So, the input12 gets the information with which level he should add his signal to the main channel left. The calculation adds only the setting levels in db, not the signal level. So the problem of “headroom” as in analogue mixing consoles does not exist. 
The adjust buttons are position coders. The actual setting of a channel is displayed via LED chain. Of course, if the selected input changes, the present “selection volume” for example changes. The LED chain will display the virtual “position” of the button. It is not possible to use potentiometers, because it may be necessary to turn this button round and round. Analogue faders can be used for master volume setting.

===Set addressing of the distributed input===
The mixing console sends out a “addressing request” bit to one input channel.
(For example, after pushing “select” and “solo” button on the mixing console.)
The distributed inputs have an addressing mode (after pushing a button). In addressing mode, the input waits for the “addressing request” bit and accepts the address as his new address for future. It shall be stored in non volatile memory, too. Then this input answers with his address normally – and the mixing console knows, the slave is addressed now and resets the “addressing request”. 
Example: pushing “address” button on an input, then pushing “select” and “solo” button on the mixing console – and the input is connected or reconnected. 

==Examples of distributed inputs==

[[File:ChoirWire_ExampleDistributedInput1.gif]]

Fig. 25: Example of a distributed input with monitor output

This example shows an implementation of a distributed input. In the middle (red) the adjust button for addressing. On the left (or bottom side, if turned) the connectors for the input (microphone, e-guitar, keyboard,…), the monitor output (for example in-ear monitor or headphone) and – the ChoirWire input. A ChoirWire output is foreseen to make chains of musicians possible. With the yellow “solo” button the solo offset of this input can be switched on and off. So no intervening from the mixing console is necessary. With the “mute” button the input can be switched off short time – for example while coughing.  The right three buttons are a small mixer for the monitor out. It mixes the own input, and two other channels from main channel, monitor 1, monitor 2, monitor 3 or monitor 4. So for example a singer can individually mix his monitoring from himself, the piano on monitor 2 and the complete set from main.
Of course other implementations are possible, for example a pure input without monitoring and a pure distributed output without addressing.


Also possible is a locally controlled distributed input without remote control. This device will send his data directly to main and a monitor channels, volume and sound are locally adjusted. Addressing and remote mixing console are not necessary; the musician controls directly the speaker output and there is no “master control” for all inputs. So this is suitable for small bands only. 
The number of monitor channels is given by the mixing console (if present) and recognized by this input; if there is no mixing console in use, the number of monitor channels is set to two, with 24 bits.

[[File:ChoirWire_ExampleDistributedInput2.gif]]

Fig. 26: Example of a distributed input which local control and without addressing

==Example of a Data Collector==

[[File:ChoirWire_Example_DataCollector.jpg|border|800px]]

Fig. 27: Example of a Data Collector

The data collector is the power supply for all distributed inputs and “collects” the music data from the right and left side of the physical data ring. It can be put in a 19’’ rack, for example, and mounted together with the power amplifier.
It contains only connections: for power, for the remote mixing console (or laptop), then the sound outputs main and monitor channels and, of course, the connector for the ChoirWire distributed inputs.
Of course, it is possible to build the mixing console and the data collector in one housing. (Then the main outputs are at the FOH – this is kind of taste.)

==Application example: Church or town hall==

With ChoirWire, present installed wiring for microphones (XLR connector system) can be used for connecting a remote mixing console. So it is easy to use more microphones on the stage than before.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Review May 5 ==
This is a good description of what's in those two papers. Here's some suggestions to try to make it better:
* See if you can do an overall introduction to the idea--you can do this without references, but I think using an example from the ''Predictably Irrational'' book would fit well with the introduction. Do this before you get to the specific studies by List &amp; Hsee et al.
* Try to get something in there about revealed preference and WARP.
* I know List starts his paper off by talking about Bentham and Mill, but I for this page, I'm afraid that gives it the feeling that the idea is out-of-date. It's still very much alive and essential, as seen by our using revealed preference in class. Maybe rephrase it some so it makes it clear that '''current economic theory''' precludes preference reversals.
* ``Riskless Choice'' is most of what we have been studying, and probably doesn't need to be highlighted much. I think List was trying to make sure that his discussion didn't get confused with preference reversal discussion which has to do with '''risky choice''', since economists mostly (now) accept that choice about risky things is ... weird.

This is a terrific start--most of the way to being a terrific finish. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 19:28, 5 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">First brought to attention by Daniel Ellsberg, the Ellsberg Paradox represents a class of choice situations in which an uncertainty is weighed against a known probability. In most cases it is observed that this uncertainty is regarded as a risk, while statistically is equally as likely of producing a given outcome as the known probability.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg&gt;Daniel Ellsberg. Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms. The Quarterly Journal of Economics ,Vol. 75, No. 4 (Nov., 1961), pp. 643-669. Published by: Oxford University Press. Article Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884324&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases the failure to realize such conditions is not due to haphazard guessing, as many irrational decisions are themselves deliberately and empirically reasoned, but represent an uncertainty about the nature of information given, where the ambiguity of the information presented to the responder incites probabilistic responses. This suggestion of of human activity by Ellsberg is in contradiction to the Savage axioms of choice, which suggest that people will react rationally, assign a relative probability to an uncertain situation, and rely on this perceived probability and expected outcome to make choices.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg /&gt;

==Examples==

'''Urn with Marbles'''&lt;ref name=Ellsberg /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Experimental Conditions&lt;/u&gt;

Urn I contains 100 red and black balls, at an unknown ratio
Urn II contains exactly 50 black and 50 red balls

&lt;u&gt;Experimental Questions&lt;/u&gt;

#  If you were to draw a ball from Urn I if you had to bet $100 dollars on drawing either Red&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; or Black&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; which would you chose?
# &quot; Which do you prefer to bet on, Red&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt; or Black&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;?&quot;
# &quot; Which do you prefer to bet on, Red&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; or Red&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;?&quot;
# &quot; Which do you prefer to bet on, Black&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; or Black&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;?&quot;

&lt;u&gt;Experimental responses&lt;/u&gt;

To the question &quot; Which do you prefer to bet on, Red&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; or Red&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;
and the question&quot; Which do you prefer to bet on, Black&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; or Black&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; the majority of responses suggested a preference in Red&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt; and Black&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt; over Red&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; and Black&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;. From these majority preferences it seems that preference is not based on statistical probability as the possibilities are equally as likely with the given characteristics.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg /&gt;

==Ambiguity==

The more ambiguous information seems, the less confident is held with the estimate of that probability, despite an ample amount of information. This presence of ambiguity comes from when questions of reliability, relevance, and conflict appears in a set of information. Ellsberg defines ambiguity in ''Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms'' as:
&quot;a quality depending on the amount, type, reliability and &quot;unanimity&quot; of information, and giving rise to one's degree of &quot;confidence&quot; in an estimate of relative likelihoods.&quot; (Ellsberg, p. 657)

Ambiguity can be found as variable in situations in which information is unreliable or conflicting,  where expectations differ from expected behavior, and where confidence in such expectations or predictions is low.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg /&gt;

'''Uncertainty'''

Because knowledge is limited, and the processes and characteristics may not have the ability to be completely known, without specific and narrowed knowledge on a subject, everyday decisions are made off of crude estimates. Confidence of such estimates rests in perceived probabilities and judgements, even though there is usually not enough information or ability to calculate probabilities to exactly support such confidence.&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;Knight, Frank H., Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit. 1921. Library of Economics and Liberty. 6 May 2012. &lt;http://www.econlib.org/library/Knight/knRUP1.html&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Risk vs Uncertainty''' 

Frank Knight, an American economist suggested a key difference  between risk and uncertainty. Risk, as Knight proposed is  a type of uncertainty (which soon becomes an effective certainty) in which probability of the outcomes can be applied. Uncertainty in turn involves a class of situations in which the probability behind outcomes seems ambiguous, or is not known. Ellsberg, who outlines the Ellsberg paradox as a class of situations in which it is observed that in certain circumstances there are  decision rules which are based in an uncertainty that lack the use of probability to describe such circumstances.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;

==Conservative Decision Rule==

Faced with a situation that involves a set of decisions which contain pay offs and weights involving different actions which can be pursued which have ambiguous values. In Ellsberg's analysis of such a simulation conservative decision towards dealing with known risks rather than uncertainty in ambiguity. Ellsberg makes this assertion that as ambiguity in a situation decreases, because of conservative though which suggests that individuals act as though the worst case scenario are more likely than their personal best estimate in order to ambiguity, and instead navigate towards known risk.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg /&gt;

==Connections to Neuroscience==

'''Risk and Ambiguity'''

*Risk
Aversion to risk and ambiguity have large and obvious ties to connections in neuroscience, in which the human mind reacts to situations involving the two uncertainties. In the case of risk, it is seem that aversion to risk coincides with fear responses. Such responses are known to be found in the amygdala area of the brain, which is responsible for immediate reaction to situations which potentially involve fear, as well as  input associations involving fear, and thus risk aversion.With the ability for strong emotional responses, it is observed that there is a strong ability to aversion to situations with greater risk.&lt;ref name=Camerer&gt;Camerer, Colin F., Loewenstein, George, and Prelec,Drazen. Neuroeconomics: Why Economics Needs Brains. The Scandinavian Journal of Economics , Vol. 106, No. 3, Behavioral Economics (Sep., 2004), pp. 555-579
Published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Scandinavian Journal of Economics
Article Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/3441124&lt;/ref&gt;

*Ambiguity
Aversion to ambiguity also can be actively observed by neurocognitive processes, specifically to emotional activity within the brain. Facing a situation of ambiguity versus a situation of certainty it has been observed that the insula cortex of the brain, which  relays and processes information about bodily states such as pain, hunger, discomfort activated differently suggesting a difference in the neuroactivity in certain and ambiguous situations.&lt;ref name=Camerer /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello,

my name is Andreas Mueller.
I'm an 43 years old communications engineer.

Singing in a Gospel choir is a hobby of me.
Our &quot;Lord's Amazing Choir &amp; Band&quot; makes 2-3 large concerts per year.
With a lot of microphones, wires an other thechnical staff which fills a lorry...

So I've made some thinking about improving this chaos and get rid of some stress.
The result is &quot;ChoirWire&quot;, a distributed mixing console. 
But makeing it, may be patenting it, would create an island solution nobody accepts.
So I try to start a public article and discussions so that a &quot;plug and play&quot; solutions for several students or manufacturers is possible - without the horrific payments for published standards.

I hope the Idea is good and makes its way.

Sincinerly

{{template shortcut|sc}}
&lt;!-- Categories and interwikis go at the bottom of this page. --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template shows all text in {{smallcaps|smallcaps}} as a hard format. That is, the caps are permanent, regardless of user preferences. For example:
* {{tlx|smallcaps all|Hello World}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps all|Hello World}}

The template performs two steps: bare text is changed into uppercase, and it is shown in small caps.

====Difference from {{tlx|smallcaps}}====
The {{tlx|smallcaps}} template is for soft formatting, which is more often what is desired. There are three differences between the templates:&lt;br/&gt;

1. '''All input text is shown in {{smallcaps|small caps}}''', not just the lowercase input. Compare:
::* {{tlx|smallcaps|Hello World}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps|Hello World}}
::* {{tlx|smallcaps all|Hello World}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps all|Hello World}}
::Note that the initial full capitals are gone.
2. '''The bare, unstyled text is changed into uppercase'''. This is relevant for non-CSS browsers, and when one copy-pastes the page. Compare:
::* {{tlx|smallcaps|Hello World}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps|Hello World}}. Copy-paste produces: &lt;code&gt;Hello World&lt;/code&gt;
::* {{tlx|smallcaps all|Hello World}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps all|Hello World}}. Copy-paste produces: &lt;code&gt;HELLO WORLD&lt;/code&gt;
3. '''To maintain initial full capitals, a second parameter is to be used'''. Doing this has no effect on how text is displayed in non-CSS browsers and with copy-paste. Example:
::* {{tlx|smallcaps all|H|ello}} {{tlx|smallcaps all|W|orld}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps all|H|ello}} {{smallcaps all|W|orld}}. Copy-paste produces: &lt;code&gt;HELLO WORLD&lt;/code&gt;

====General Usage====
This template should only be used for words, such as acronyms, that should be capitalized regardless of typographic style. Examples are {{smallcaps all|NASA}} and {{smallcaps all|BC/AD}}, which are stylistic variants of NASA and BC/AD. 

It should not be used for things that are not inherently capitalized, such as the use of small caps to distinguish given from family names, because it makes the capitalization permanent, and the reader cannot override it. In such cases, the template {{tl|smallcaps}} should be used instead.

;Examples
To lighten ALL-CAP words, abbreviations, or [[w:acronym|acronym]]s, as a matter of typographic style
* The initialism [[w:UNESCO|{{smallcaps all|U|nesco}}]] (instead of UNESCO)
* The trademark [[w:Time (magazine)|{{smallcaps all|T|ime}}]] (instead of TIME)
* Dates such as 625&amp;nbsp;{{smallcaps all|BCE}}

If the template is placed outside a link, it will capitalize the link itself, so in some cases it needs to be placed inside the link.

===See also===
Templates that change the display (copy-paste will get the original text):

'''{{tl|Nocaps}}''' will display text in full lower case.

===Usage===
The source text will not be altered (copying/pasting the text will be presented in its original form), only in its browser display. You can use this template to control the display of the variable output of [[w:Help:Magic words#Formatting|magic words]] and of other templates.
Instead of HELLO you would have hello

===Example===
; Code : &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Nocaps|thE ''NaMe'' oF thE GAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
; Result : {{Nocaps|thE ''NaMe'' oF thE GAME}}

===Note===
'''Substitution (&lt;code&gt;subst:&lt;/code&gt;) of this template is not recommended.''' The result will ''not'' create lower case source text but only an appearance thereof; the original text will wrapped in an HTML tag in the page source. Because of this, it would be more effective to simply edit the original text as lower case.

===See also===
Templates that change the display (copying/pasting will present the original text):

* {{tl|Allcaps}}   – upper-case display
* {{tl|Smallcaps}}    – small-caps display
* {{tl|Smallcaps all}} – hard-formatted small-caps display

[[w:Help:Magic words#Formatting|Magic words]] that rewrite the output (copying/pasting will present the text as displayed):

* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;lc:}}      – lower case output of the full text
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;uc:}}      – upper case output of the full text
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;lcfirst:}} – lower case output of the first character only
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;ucfirst:}} – upper case output of the first character only

__NOTOC__
'''{{tl|Allcaps}}''' will display text in all capital letters.

===Usage===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Allcaps|your text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will display your text in full upper case. Your source text is not altered (a copy-paste will give it in its original form), only the way it is displayed. You can use this template to control the display of the variable output of magic words and of other templates.

: '''In:''' &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Allcaps|The ''Name'' of the Game}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: '''Out:''' {{Allcaps|The ''Name'' of the Game}}

'''Preferably do not subst: it''' because the result will NOT be an uppercase source text but the original text wrapped in HTML code making it appear uppercase, so it is more efficient for this purpose to simply rewrite the text in uppercase once and for all.

Templates that change the display (copy-paste will get the original text):

* {{tl|Nocaps}}    – lower case display
* {{tl|Smallcaps}} – small caps display
* {{tl|Smallcaps all}} – hard-formatted small-caps display

* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;ucfirst:}} – upper case output of the first character only

{{notice|There are far too many labelled image templates with widths and scales of -1 or are inconsistent. Please don't do that. Keep both widths and scales greater than zero and exactly the same in each template. For example, if width is 300, then all the scales must also be 300. Thanks.&lt;!-- See http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3ALanarkshire_and_Ayrshire_Railway_Map&amp;diff=165876967&amp;oldid=165872467 --&gt;}}

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;How to use&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Consider this example, adapted from [[Template:France Regions Labelled Map]]:
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
{{Image label begin|image=France fond de carte 27 régions.png|width={{{width|400}}}|float={{{float|right}}}}}
{{Image label small|x=0.4875|y=0.07|scale={{{width|400}}}|text=Nord-Pas &lt;br /&gt;de Calais}}
{{Image label small|x=0.5225|y=0.165|scale={{{width|400}}}|text=Picardy}}
...
{{Image label end}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;

;Width/Scale
In this example, '''all widths must be set to the same number''' of 400 as the default width.
They must all be the same number of 400 for the template to be &lt;u&gt;functionally scalable&lt;/u&gt;.
This means they can be displayed at a different size by supplying a width parameter to the template when in use.
For example, ''&amp;#123;{France Regions Labelled Map|width=500}}'' will display the labelled image as a larger one of 500 pixels in width instead of 400.

To change the default size, search and replace
&quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;{&amp;#123;{width|400}}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;
with
&quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;{&amp;#123;{width|500}}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

For earthly geographic maps, conforming to these specifications can allow easier conversion for any other purposes such as for the use of {{tl|Location map+}}.

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;X/Y&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

X and Y values are always between 0 and 1.
They represent the percentages of the width and height respectively where the label will be placed.
The exact point is the top-left corner of the image label.
 x=0  |y=0   will place the top-left corner of the label at the top-left     of the image
 x=0  |y=1   will place the top-left corner of the label at the bottom-left  of the image
 x=1  |y=1   will place the top-left corner of the label at the bottom-right of the image
 x=1  |y=0   will place the top-left corner of the label at the top-right    of the image
 x=0.5|y=0.5 will place the top-left corner of the label at the centre       of the image

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;Image&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The title of the wiki page of the image without the &quot;Image:&quot; prefix.

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;Text&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The text label to display as wiki markup.

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;Float&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Three options:
 {&amp;#123;{float|none}}}  makes the image sit on its own line of the page by default
 {&amp;#123;{float|left}}}  makes the image pushed to the left of the page  by default
 {&amp;#123;{float|right}}} makes the image pushed to the right of the page by default

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;link&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Specifies where the image should link to. If &lt;code&gt;File:&lt;/code&gt; (the default), the image links to its file page. If empty, the image does not link to anything; this is appropriate for [[WP:ALT #Purely decorative images|purely decorative images]].

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;alt&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Specifies text to be used in the image's &quot;alt&quot; attribute. If {{para|link}} is empty, this should be empty; if {{para|link}} is &lt;code&gt;File:&lt;/code&gt; or is not given, this should describe the image; if {{para|link}} points to some other page this should describe the action that will be taken if you click on the image.

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;caption&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Specifies text to be used in the image's &quot;title&quot; attribute.
In certain browsers, this text will appear in a tooltip when the mouse pointer is rolled over it.

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;==&lt;/noinclude&gt;Template set&lt;noinclude&gt;==&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This template will determine the name of a language from its [[w:IETF language code|IETF language code]] or [[w:ISO 6391 code|ISO 6391 code]]. The name will be given in English by default, or in the language that is specified in the second parameter. The second parameter should also be specified using a language code. If parameter two is set to a language other than English the name will be wrapped in the {{tl|lang}} template.

=== Usage ===
&lt;inputbox&gt;
type=create
default=Template:Language/
preload=Template:Language/doc/preload
&lt;/inputbox&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
===Usage===
The template is used mainly for image placement.   The default is for {{#switch: {{Str right|{{BASEPAGENAME}}|7}} | left = a left | right = a right | center = a center | none = no | #default = a left }} alignment.  Whereas an image without a border cannot have a caption, this limitation is overcome by placing the image in a table cell construct which resembles the usual thing.     It behaves broadly as if it were simple image syntax.

It is called as follows:
{{tlx|{{BASEPAGENAME}}|&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Gerbera pink.jpg|250px]]|Pink Gerbera : ''This is the caption''&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

It looks like this.  (Text has been added to illustrate the default spacings.):
{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|[[File:Gerbera pink.jpg|250px]]|Pink Gerbera : ''This is the caption''}}
{{text}}{{text}}{{text}}{{text}}
{{-}}

===Parameters===
There are two parameters.  They are each numbered and named. 
*The first parameter contains the wiki image syntax line.   This can be specified with {{para|content}} or simply as a nameless parameter if placed in the first position.
*The second parameter contains the text for the image caption.  This can be specified with {{para|caption}} or as a nameless parameter.  Use the former if the caption contains an equals (=) sign.
*Note that the parameter names are in lower case.  These (along with image file names) are case sensitive.
*The optional values that are listed below must equate to the option names, with the options and parameters all spaced from one another with pipe symbols.  An example for use at the right of the page would look like this:
*:{{tlx|{{BASEPAGENAME}}|content&lt;nowiki&gt;=[[File:Gerbera pink.jpg|250px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|caption{{=}}Caption|align{{=}}right|margin{{=}}0 0 0 1em}}

===Options===
;align:  override the default position on the page, left, center, right, none. 
;margin:  overall margins; in em, px, etc.
;background: structure background color, ''default transparent''; hex, rgb, named colors etc. 
;color:   font color, ''default black''; any color e.g. hex, rgb, or named color.
;ff:   font family, ''default inherit''; any family, or font face name.
;border: border color, ''default none''; can look like a frame with &lt;nowiki&gt;border=1px solid #aaaaaa;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
;padding: text padding for the caption only, ''default 2px 2px 2px 4px''; in em, px, etc.

===See also===
Several templates are available that specify the default alignment without a parameter, allowing the specification of only the image and caption:
*{{tl|noframeleft}}
*{{tl|noframecenter}}
*{{tl|noframeright}}
*{{tl|noframenone}}

This template places one or more location marks on a map, with optional labels. It is in the same family of templates as the [[Template:Location map|Location map]] template and the documentation for that template might be helpful.

This template uses a helper template, [[Template:Location map~|Location map~]], one or more times to generate a mark for each location.

=== Usage ===

{|
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
|&lt;pre style=&quot;width:15em; margin-right:2em;&quot;&gt;
{{Location map+
| {{{1}}}
| width          =
| float          =
| border         =
| caption        =
| alt            =
| relief         =
| AlternativeMap =
| overlay_image  =
| places         =
}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre style=&quot;width:15em;&quot;&gt;
{{Location map~
| {{{1}}}
| label      =
| label_size =
| position   =
| background =
| mark       =
| marksize   =
| link       =
| lat_deg    =

=== Parameters ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
|+ Parameters for Location map+
! Parameter
! Description
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/tt&gt;
| Required. Use the name of the map as the first unnamed parameter. For example, specify ''England'' to use the values in {{tl|Location map England}}. See the [[#Examples|examples]] below.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;width&lt;/tt&gt;
| Determines the width of the map in [[w:pixel|pixel]]s. The default is 240. Do not include &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;width=300&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;width=300px&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;
| Specifies the position of the map on the page. Valid values are &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;. The default is &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;''.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;border&lt;/tt&gt;
|  Specifies the color of the 1px map border. The default is ''lightgrey'' (see [[w:Web colors|Web colors]]). If set to &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;, no border will be generated. This parameter is seldom used.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;caption&lt;/tt&gt;
| The text of a caption to be displayed below the map. Specifying a caption will cause the map to be displayed with a frame. If &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; is defined but is not assigned a value, the map will not be framed and no caption will be displayed. If &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; is not defined, the map will not be framed and a default caption will be generated. The default caption is created from the &lt;tt&gt;label&lt;/tt&gt; parameter (or the current page name if label not defined) and the &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt; parameter from map definition template. See the [[#Examples|examples]] below.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;alt&lt;/tt&gt;
| Alt text for map; used by screen readers.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;relief&lt;/tt&gt;
| Any non-blank value (1, yes, etc.) will cause the template to display the map specified in the map definition template as &lt;tt&gt;image1&lt;/tt&gt;, which is usually a [[w:Relief mapping (computer graphics)|relief map]]. See the example at [[Template:Location_map#Relief_parameter|Template:Location map]].
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;AlternativeMap&lt;/tt&gt;
| Allows the use of an alternative map. The image must have the same edge coordinates as the location map template. See the example at [[Template:Location_map#AlternativeMap_parameter|Template:Location map]].
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;overlay_image&lt;/tt&gt;
| Allows an overlay to be superimposed on the map. This parameter is seldom used.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;places&lt;/tt&gt;
| Specifies one or more place markers using &lt;code&gt;Location map~&lt;code&gt;.
|}

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
|+ Parameters for Location map~
! Parameter
! Description
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/tt&gt;
| Required. Use the name of the map as the first unnamed parameter. For example, specify ''England'' to use the values in {{tl|Location map England}}. See the [[#Examples|examples]] below.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;label&lt;/tt&gt;
| The text of the label to display next to the mark. A wiki link can be used. The default if not specified is no label, just the marker.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;label_size&lt;/tt&gt;
|  The font size to use for the label, given as a percentage of the normal font size (&lt;100 = smaller, &gt;100 = larger). The default is 90. Do not include &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;label_size=80&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;label_size=80%&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;position&lt;/tt&gt;
| The position of the label relative to the mark. Valid values are &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt;. The default is &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;''.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;background&lt;/tt&gt;
| The background color to use for the label. See [[w:Web colors|Web colors]]. The default is no background color, which shows the map image behind the label.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;mark&lt;/tt&gt;
| The name of an image to display as the mark. The default is [[:File:Red pog.svg|Red pog.svg]] ([[File:Red pog.svg|8px]]). See examples at [[Commons:Location markers]] and [[Commons:Category:Map icons]].
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;marksize&lt;/tt&gt;
| The size of the mark in [[w:pixel|pixel]]s. The default is 8. Do not include &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;marksize=10&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;marksize=10px&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;link&lt;/tt&gt;
| Specifies a wiki link which will be followed if the reader clicks on the mark. The name of the linked article is displayed when the mouse pointer hovers over the mark.
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;lat_deg&lt;/tt&gt;
| Required. The degrees of [[w:latitude|latitude]]. This value can be specified using [[w:decimal degrees|decimal degrees]] and when this format is used minutes and seconds should not be specified.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;lat_min&lt;/tt&gt;
| The minutes of latitude.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;lat_sec&lt;/tt&gt;
| The seconds of latitude. Usually not necessary.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;lat_dir&lt;/tt&gt;
| N if north (default value) or S for south of the [[w:Equator|Equator]]. Other values will be disregarded. Not required if using signed decimal degrees (i.e. negative numbers for southern latitude).
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;lon_deg&lt;/tt&gt;
| Required. The degrees of [[w:longitude|longitude]]. This value can be specified using [[w:decimal degrees|decimal degrees]] and when this format is used minutes and seconds should not be specified.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;lon_min&lt;/tt&gt;
| The minutes of longitude.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;lon_sec&lt;/tt&gt;
| The seconds of longitude. Usually not necessary.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;lon_dir&lt;/tt&gt;
| E for east (default value) or W for west of the [[w:Prime Meridian|Prime Meridian]]. Other values will be disregarded. Not required if using signed decimal degrees (i.e. negative numbers for western longitude).

=== Available map templates ===

Location map templates can be found using these sources:

:[[:Category:Location map templates]] - templates sorted by category.
:[[Special:Prefixindex/Template:Location map]] - another search that might help.

=== Creating new map definition templates ===

See [[Template:Location map/Creating a new map template|Creating a new map template]].

=== Examples ===

This example does not designate the &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; parameter. It demonstrates the use of the defaults. Notice that the default caption is the page name followed by the map name in parenthesis and that the label position is automatically adjusted if it is too close to an edge.

{{Location map+ | Australia

&lt;!-- DOCUMENTATION --&gt;
This template generates a location map as a [[m:Help:composite images|composite image]] consisting of a map and a location mark. Optionally a label and caption can be added.

== Usage ==
Map image files are not accessed directly but by using an auxiliary map definition template. For example, if the first unnamed parameter supplied to this template is &quot;Japan&quot;, then this template uses the auxiliary template, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Location map Japan}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; which contains the data needed to generate the composite image.

;Please note:
* Assigning any value to the parameter &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; causes the map to be displayed as a thumbnail image. If this parameter is not declared, the template will generate a default caption.
* The coordinates are not checked. If the coordinates specified fall outside the area covered by the map image, the location mark will not display inside the image, however, it may be displayed somewhere else on the page.
* Do not use '''&lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;'''. Using &lt;code&gt;width=200px&lt;/code&gt; will usually cause a very large map to be displayed. Use &lt;code&gt;width=200&lt;/code&gt;.
* To create a map with more than one location mark use {{tl|Location map+}}.

== Blank templates ==

== Parameters ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background-color:lightblue&quot; | Map display parameters
|-
! Parameter
! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/code&gt;
| '''Required'''. Use the name of the map as the first unnamed parameter. For example, specify ''England'' to use the values in {{tl|Location map England}}. See the [[#Examples|examples]] below.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;
| Determines the width of the map in [[w:pixel|pixel]]s. The default is 240. Do not include &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;width=300&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;width=300px&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;
| Specifies the position of the map on the page. Valid values are &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;. The default is &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;''.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt;
|  Specifies the color of the 1px map border. The default is ''lightgrey'' (see [[w:Web colors|Web colors]]). If set to &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;, no border will be generated. This parameter is seldom used.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt;
| The text of a caption to be displayed below the map. Specifying a caption will cause the map to be displayed with a frame. If &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; is defined but is not assigned a value, the map will not be framed and no caption will be displayed. If &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; is not defined, the map will not be framed and a default caption will be generated. The default caption is created from the &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; parameter (or the current page name if label not defined) and the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; parameter from map definition template. See the [[#Examples|examples]] below.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt;
| Alt text for map; used by screen readers.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;relief&lt;/code&gt;
| Any non-blank value (1, yes, etc.) will cause the template to display the map specified in the map definition template as &lt;code&gt;image1&lt;/code&gt;, which is usually a [[w:Relief mapping (computer graphics)|relief map]]. See the example at [[#Relief parameter|below]].
|-
| &lt;code&gt;AlternativeMap&lt;/code&gt;
| Allows the use of an alternative map. The image must have the same edge coordinates as the location map template. See the example [[#AlternativeMap parameter|below]].
|-
| &lt;code&gt;overlay_image&lt;/code&gt;
| Allows an overlay to be superimposed on the map. This parameter is seldom used.
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background-color:lightblue&quot; | Label and mark parameters
|-
! Parameter
! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;
| The text of the label to display next to the mark. A wiki link can be used. The default if not specified is no label, just the marker.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;label_size&lt;/code&gt;
| The font size to use for the label, given as a percentage of the normal font size (&lt;100 = smaller, &gt;100 = larger). The default is 90. Do not include &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;label_size=80&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;label_size=80%&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;label_width&lt;/code&gt;
| The width to use for the label, given as an [[w:Em (typography)#CSS|em size]]. The default is 6. Do not include &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;label_width=7&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;label_width=7em&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;position&lt;/code&gt;
| The position of the label relative to the mark. Valid values are &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt;. The default is &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;''.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;background&lt;/code&gt;
| The background color to use for the label. See [[w:Web colors|Web colors]]. The default is no background color, which shows the map image behind the label.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;mark&lt;/code&gt;
| The name of an image to display as the mark. The default is [[:File:Red pog.svg|Red pog.svg]] ([[File:Red pog.svg|8px]]). See examples at [[Commons:Location markers]] and [[Commons:Category:Map icons]].
|-
| &lt;code&gt;marksize&lt;/code&gt;
| The size of the mark in [[w:pixel|pixel]]s. The default is 8. Do not include &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;marksize=10&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;marksize=10px&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;
| Specifies a wiki link which will be followed if the reader clicks on the mark. The name of the linked page is displayed when the mouse pointer hovers over the mark.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;lat_deg&lt;/code&gt;
| '''Required'''. The degrees of [[w:latitude|latitude]]. This value can be specified using [[w:decimal degrees|decimal degrees]] and when this format is used minutes and seconds should not be specified.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;lat_min&lt;/code&gt;
| The minutes of latitude.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;lat_sec&lt;/code&gt;
| The seconds of latitude. Usually not necessary.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;lat_dir&lt;/code&gt;
| N if north (default value) or S for south of the [[w:Equator|Equator]]. Other values will be disregarded. Not required if using signed decimal degrees (i.e. negative numbers for southern latitude).
|-
| &lt;code&gt;lon_deg&lt;/code&gt;
| '''Required'''. The degrees of [[w:longitude|longitude]]. This value can be specified using [[w:decimal degrees|decimal degrees]] and when this format is used minutes and seconds should not be specified.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;lon_min&lt;/code&gt;
| The minutes of longitude.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;lon_sec&lt;/code&gt;
| The seconds of longitude. Usually not necessary.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;lon_dir&lt;/code&gt;
| E for east (default value) or W for west of the [[w:Prime Meridian|Prime Meridian]]. Other values will be disregarded. Not required if using signed decimal degrees (i.e. negative numbers for western longitude).

* [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:Location map]] - another search that might help

== Creating new map definition templates ==

See [[Template:Location map/Creating a new map template|Creating a new map template]].

== Examples ==

=== Default width and float, no label, default caption (decimal coordinates) ===
{{Location map | Croatia
| alt     = Pag is on an island.
| lat_deg = 44.44
| lon_deg = 15.05
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;width: 40em;&quot;&gt;
{{Location map | Croatia
| alt     = Pag is on an island.
| lat_deg = 44.44
| lon_deg = 15.05
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note: When a label is not specified, the default caption is &quot;Page name (Map name)&quot;, so if this example was viewed on a page named ''Pag'', the default caption would be &quot;Pag (Croatia)&quot;. Likewise, on a page named ''Pag (town)'', the default caption would be &quot;Pag (town) (Croatia)&quot;.
{{clear}}

=== Map with the default caption (degrees/minutes) ===
{{Location map | Croatia
| width = 200
| float = right
| alt = Pag is on an island.
| label = Pag
| position = right
| mark = Green pog.svg &lt;!--green dot--&gt;
| lat_deg = 44 | lat_min = 26 &lt;!-- lat_dir = N --&gt;
| lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 3  &lt;!-- lat_dir = E --&gt;
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;width: 40em;&quot;&gt;
{{Location map | Croatia
| width = 200
| float = right
| alt = Pag is on an island.
| label = Pag
| position = right
| mark = Green pog.svg &lt;!--green dot--&gt;

| lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 3  &lt;!-- lat_dir = E --&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note: When a label is specified, the default caption is &quot;Label text (Map name)&quot;, seen as &quot;Pag (Croatia)&quot; in this example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Understanding map definition templates ==
{{expand}}

The {{tl|Location map}} family of templates utilize any one of a set of map definition templates. These are not forks but rather auxiliary templates and are must have names such as &quot;Location map ''location''&quot;, where ''location'' is the name of the area covered by the map. To create a simple map definition template using an image of a map with an [[w:equirectangular projection|equirectangular]] [[w:Mercator projection|Mercator projection]]:

# Create a new map image and upload it to [[commons:Main Page|Wikimedia commons]] or find an existing map on the same site.
# Create a template named Template:Location map ''location'', copy the content below into it and substitute the appropriate values.

As an example of a map that uses an equirectangular projection, we use {{tl|Location map Bosnia and Herzegovina}}. Please do not experiment using active templates.

&lt;pre style=&quot;width: 30em;&quot;&gt;
{{#switch:{{{1}}}
| name   = Bosnia and Herzegovina
| top    = 45.4
| bottom = 42.4
| left   = 15.5
| right  = 19.9
| image  = Bosnia and Herzegovina location map.svg
| image1 = Bosnia and Herzegovina relief location map.png
}}&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{Location map/Info}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot;
! Parameter
! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;
| The name of the area covered
|-
| &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;
| The latitude of the top edge of the image using [[w:decimal degrees|decimal degrees]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt;
| The latitude of the bottom edge of the image
|-
| &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;
| longitude of the left edges of the image
|-
| &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;
| longitude of the right edges of the image
|-
| &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt;
| The name of the image file on Commons
|-
| &lt;code&gt;image1&lt;/code&gt;
| The name of an alternate image, usually a relief map that can be accessed using the &lt;code&gt;relief&lt;/code&gt; parameter.
|}

Maps of this type work will for small to mid sized areas. {{tl|Location map USA}} is another example of a map description template that uses an equirectangular projection. Notice that the image of the country is not what most would expect. 

Maps that use other projections, such as {{tl|Location map USA2}}, which uses an equidistant [[w:conic projection|conic projection]]. require formulas which are used to calculate the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; coordinates for the location mark. Understanding these formulas requires a familiarity with the subject and is currently beyond the scope of this discussion. Note that the formula for &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to 0 for the left edge of the image and 100 for the right edge. Likewise, the formula for &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to 0 for the top edge and 100 for the bottom edge.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
This template displays values for the map templates such as {{tl|Location map Croatia}}. These templates are used by {{tl|Location map}} to obtain values such as the file name and the border coordinates of each location map.

=== Usage ===
;On a template page
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Location map/Info}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
;On a documentation sup-page
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Location map/Info}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

====The &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; parameter====

The {{tl|Location map}} family of templates uses the value assigned to &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; to generate alt text. It is used to construct the sentence &quot;&lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; is located in &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Assign a value to &lt;code&gt;&lt;name&gt;&lt;/code&gt; that fits in the sentence. For example:

:  Chicago is located in &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; United States&lt;/u&gt;. So {{para|name|the United states}}.
:  Santo Domingo is located in &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; Dominican Republic. So {{para|name|the Dominican Republic}}.

* [[Template:Location map]], to display a single marker and label
* [[Template:Location map+]], to display unlimited number of markers and labels
* [[Template:Location map~]], helper template for &lt;tt&gt;Location map+&lt;/tt&gt;

[[File:As-map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Australia]]

'''Template:Location map Australia''' is a location map definition used to overlay markers and labels on an [[w:equirectangular projection|equirectangular projection]] map of [[w:Australia|Australia]]. The markers are placed by [[w:latitude|latitude]] and [[w:longitude|longitude]] coordinates on the default map or a similar map image. 

== Usage ==
These definitions are used by the following templates when invoked with parameter &quot;Australia&quot;:
* {{tlx|Location map | Australia&amp;nbsp;| ...}}
* {{tlx|Location map+ | Australia&amp;nbsp;| ...}}
* {{tlx|Location map~ | Australia&amp;nbsp;| ...}}

== Map definition ==
* &lt;tt&gt;'''name''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|name}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: Name used in the default map caption

* &lt;tt&gt;'''image''' = [[:File:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image}}|{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image}}]]&lt;/tt&gt;
*: The default map image, without &quot;Image:&quot; or &quot;File:&quot;
{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}|

* &lt;tt&gt;'''image1''' = [[:File:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}|{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}]]&lt;/tt&gt;
*: An alternative map image, usually a relief map, can be displayed via the ''relief'' or ''AlternativeMap'' parameters
}}{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}|

* &lt;tt&gt;'''image2''' = [[:File:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}|{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}]]&lt;/tt&gt;
*: A second alternative map image, can be displayed via the ''AlternativeMap'' parameter only
}}{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|top}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|bottom}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|left}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|right}}|

* &lt;tt&gt;'''top''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|top}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: [[w:Latitude|Latitude]] at top edge of map, in [[w:decimal degrees|decimal degrees]]

* &lt;tt&gt;'''bottom''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|bottom}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: Latitude at bottom edge of map, in decimal degrees

* &lt;tt&gt;'''left''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|left}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: [[w:Longitude|Longitude]] at left edge of map, in decimal degrees

* &lt;tt&gt;'''right''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|right}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: Longitude at right edge of map, in decimal degrees
}}{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|x}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|y}}|

* &lt;tt&gt;'''x''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|x}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: An expression to calculate a location on the map via its [[w:longitude|longitude]]; evaluates as 0 along the left edge and 100 along the right edge

* &lt;tt&gt;'''y''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|y}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: An expression to calculate a location on the map via its [[w:latitude|latitude]]; evaluates as 0 along the top edge and 100 along the bottom edge
}}
{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}|
== Alternative map ==
The map defined as '''image1''' (&lt;tt&gt;{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}&lt;/tt&gt;) can be displayed by using the ''relief'' or ''AlternativeMap'' parameters in {{tl|Location map}} and {{tl|Location map+}}. {{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}| The map defined as '''image2''' (&lt;tt&gt;{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}&lt;/tt&gt;) can only be displayed by using the ''AlternativeMap'' parameter.}} The use of these two parameters is shown in the examples below.

== Alternative map ==
The map defined as '''image1''' (&lt;tt&gt;{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}&lt;/tt&gt;) can be displayed by using the ''relief'' or ''AlternativeMap'' parameters in {{tl|Location map}} and {{tl|Location map+}}. {{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}| The map defined as '''image2''' (&lt;tt&gt;{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}&lt;/tt&gt;) can only be displayed by using the ''AlternativeMap'' parameter.}} The use of these two parameters is shown in the examples below.

== Examples using location map templates ==

=== Location map, using default map (image) ===
{{Location map | Bosnia and Herzegovina
| width   = 200
| label   = Sarajevo
| lat_deg = 43.85
| lon_deg = 18.36

}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Location map, using relief map (image1) ===
{{Location map | Bosnia and Herzegovina
| relief   = yes

| width   = 200
| label   = Sarajevo
| lat_deg = 43.85
| lon_deg = 18.36
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Location map+, using AlternativeMap ===
{{Location map+ | Bosnia and Herzegovina
| AlternativeMap = Bosnia and Herzegovina physical map.svg
| width   = 200
| caption = Two locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina
| places  =
  {{Location map~ | Bosnia and Herzegovina
  | label   = Sarajevo

== How to use an alternative map ==
This template normally displays the map shown above as '''image''':
*&lt;tt&gt;{{{{PAGENAME}}|image}}&lt;/tt&gt;.
The ''AlternativeMap'' parameter in [[Template:Location map]] can be used to display {{#if:{{{{PAGENAME}}|image2}}|one of the following images|the following image}}:
*&lt;tt&gt;{{{{PAGENAME}}|image1}}&lt;/tt&gt;
{{#if:{{{{PAGENAME}}|image2}}|
*&lt;tt&gt;{{{{PAGENAME}}|image2}}&lt;/tt&gt;
}}
Further instructions and examples can be found at [[Template:Location map#AlternativeMap parameter]].

==Multiple terms==
:Place the most recent terms at the top. When both a start and an end term are given, you can instead specify the complete term using using the parameters {{para|term}}, {{para|terms2}}, etc., as is done with {{para|term3}} in the example below. This can be helpful with complicated terms that cannot be given as simple starting or ending dates, or if you prefer something other than the default term separator (an en dash, with spaces around it if the start or end is not a simple integer date).

=== Usage ===
This template is used for displaying a date in both Old Style and New Style, including a discreet link to the article [[w:Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style and New Style dates]], in cases where the year is the same in both Styles.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{OldStyleDate|NS day and month|year|OS day and month}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If it helps you remember the order of the parameters, you may optionally choose to think of it like this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{OldStyleDate|NS day and month|NS year|OS day and month|OS year}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Note that in this usage the fourth parameter will be ''ignored'' when the template is rendered.

=== Examples ===
* Usage: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{OldStyleDate|2 February|1905|20 January}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** Result: {{OldStyleDate|2 February|1905|20 January}}

* Usage: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{OldStyleDate|February 2|1905|January 20}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** Result: {{OldStyleDate|February 2|1905|January 20}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template can be used to create a formatted external link.

=== Usage ===
:* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{URL|&lt;/nowiki&gt;1=''url name''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;2=''optional display text''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:** The first parameter is parsed to see if it takes the form of a complete URL. If it doesn't start with an known URI scheme and a slash (&quot;http:/&quot; or &quot;https:/&quot; or &quot;ftp:/&quot;, possibly others in the future, by editing its code), an &quot;http://&quot; prefix will be prepended to the specified generated target URL of the link.
:** If no display text is specified or is empty, a default display text will be inferred by trying to reduce the specified URL without its recognized URI scheme (without the default &quot;/&quot; path of HTTP and FTP resources), and the domain name part will be forced to lowercase (for shorter and canonical display, but also to limit the occurrences of easily confusable characters, for example between letters and digits). The rest of the URL (including the rest of its path, the optional query string or the specified anchor) will be displayed unchanged.
:* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{URL|&lt;/nowiki&gt;2=''display text''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:** The url or domain name is optional : if it is not specified in the first parameter or this parameter is empty, the display text becomes mandatory, and will be displayed without any change.
:** If both parameters are missing or empty, a default message referencing a correct usage of this template will be generated (including a link to this page), to help editors.

: '''Warning:'''
:* It is strongly advised to number the parameters explicitly (notably when the value of the URL is unknown, for example when this template is used in another template specifying the effective URL as a variable value), because many URLs contain an equal sign (in their query string). In that case, the second parameter for the displayed text, if present, '''must''' also be explicitly numbered ; otherwise it will override the value of the explicitly numbered first parameter.
:* If you specify a query string (starting by &quot;?&quot;, up to the end of the string or up to the first &quot;#&quot; character) or an anchor (starting by '&quot;#&quot; up to the end of the string) in the first parameter then you '''must''' specify at least the default path &quot;/&quot; immediately after the domain name ; otherwise the resulting link target will be unpredictable, as the query string and/or the anchor may be unexpectedly converted to all lowercase ; it is strongly recommended to use full and canonical URLs in the first parameter (without depending on the tentative detection of a missing URI scheme or path). Don't worry, this default &quot;/&quot; path won't be visible in the default display text.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

===Usage===
{{tl|Plainlist}} starts a plain, or unbulleted, list, such as:

{{plainlist|
*[[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]
*[[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]]
*[[Cookbook:Bread Recipes|Bread]]
*[[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast]]
*[[Cookbook:Confections|Confections]]
*[[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]]
*[[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meats]]
*[[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta]]
*[[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Rice]]
*[[Cookbook:Salad Recipes|Salads]]
}}

It uses proper HTML list markup, which is more standards-compliant and more accessible than separating list items with {{tag|br|s}}.

This template can be used with or without {{tl|endplainlist}}. It is an alternative to {{Tl|Unbulleted list}}, which performs the same function in a more concise but less wiki-style manner.

===Examples===
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Plainlist |
*[[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]
*[[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]]
*[[Cookbook:Bread Recipes|Bread]]
*[[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast]]
*[[Cookbook:Confections|Confections]]
*[[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]]
*[[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meats]]
*[[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta]]
*[[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Rice]]
*[[Cookbook:Salad Recipes|Salads]]
}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Plainlist |
*[[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]
*[[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]]
*[[Cookbook:Bread Recipes|Bread]]
*[[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast]]

===Parameters===
* '''indent''' – indents the list by a number of standard indents (one indent being 1.6em), particularly handy for inclusion in an indented discussion thread.
::Example: {{para|&lt;var&gt;indent&lt;/var&gt;|&lt;var&gt;2&lt;/var&gt;}}
* '''style''' – adds CSS style options.
::Example: {{para|&lt;var&gt;style&lt;/var&gt;|&lt;var&gt;border:solid 1px silver; background:lightyellow&lt;/var&gt;}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is used (primarily in infoboxes) to create unbulleted lists using the correct HTML mark-up using CSS to hide the bullets. Up to 50 entries are supported. Each item in the list may have styles added to it individually, by appending a numbered parameter. The parameter &lt;tt&gt;li_style1&lt;/tt&gt; formats the first item, &lt;tt&gt;li_style2&lt;/tt&gt; the second, and so on.

=== Usage ===
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Unbulleted list|entry1|entry2|entry3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Unbulleted list|entry1|entry2|entry3|li_style1=css-style-a;css-style-b;|li_style3=css-style-x;css-style-y;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;


=== Examples ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Code !! Result
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Unbulleted list|entry1|entry2|entry3|entry4|entry5|entry6|entry7|entry8|entry9}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || {{Unbulleted list|entry1|entry2|entry3|entry4|entry5|entry6|entry7|entry8|entry9}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Unbulleted list|Winner|Runner-up|Third place|li_style1=background-color:#FE2;|li_style2=background-color:#DDD;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || {{Unbulleted list|Winner|Runner-up|Third place|li_style1=background-color:#FE2;|li_style2=background-color:#DDD;}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Unbulleted list| |entry2|entry3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || {{Unbulleted list| |entry2|entry3}}
|-

{{Coord how-to}}

__TOC__
==Purpose==
{{Tl|Coord}} provides a standard notation for encoding locations by their [[w:latitude|latitude]] and [[w:longitude|longitude]] coordinates. It is primarily for specifying the [[w:World Geodetic System|WGS84]] geographic coordinates of locations on [[w:Earth|Earth]], at the same time emitting a machine-readable [[w:Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]]. However, it can also encode locations on natural satellites, dwarf planets, and planets other than Earth.

==Features==
Latitude and longitude may be specified (with appropriate precision) either in decimal notation or as degrees/minutes/seconds.  By default, coordinates appear in the format used to specify them.  However, the &lt;code&gt;format=&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be used to force display in a particular format. 

The template displays the formatted coordinates with a [[w:hyperlink|hyperlink]] to [[tswiki:GeoHack|GeoHack]]. GeoHack displays information customized to the location, including links to external mapping services.

For [[w:Earth|terrestrial]] locations, a blue globe ([[File:Erioll_world.svg|18px|link=|alt=]]) appears to the left of the hyperlink.  Clicking on the globe activates the [[:meta:WikiMiniAtlas|WikiMiniAtlas]] (requires [[JavaScript]]).

By default, coordinates appear &quot;in line&quot; with the adjacent text.  However, the &lt;code&gt;display=&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be used to move the coordinates up near the page title—or display them in both places at once.

The template outputs coordinates in three formats:
* Degree/minutes/seconds (&quot;DMS&quot;, precision is degrees, or degrees/minutes, or degrees/minutes/seconds, based on input precision).
* Decimal degrees (varying the number of decimal places based on input precision)
* A machine readable [[w:Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]].

Logged-in users can customize how coordinates appear in their browsers.

== Usage ==
 '''&amp;#123;{coord|'''''latitude'''''|'''''longitude'''''|'''''[[#1|coordinate parameters]]'''''|'''''[[#2|template parameters]]'''''}&amp;#125;'''

The hemisphere identifiers (''N/S'') and (''E/W''), if used, must be adjacent to the enclosing pipe &quot;'''&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;'''&quot; characters, and cannot be preceded or succeeded by spaces.

There are two kinds of parameters, all optional:

*&lt;span id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;'''Coordinate parameters'''&lt;/span&gt; are parameters that {{tl|Coord}} passes to the map server. These have the format ''parameter:value'' and are separated from each other by the underscore character ( _ ). The supported coordinate parameters are ''dim:'', ''globe:'', ''region:'', ''scale:'', ''source:'', and ''type:''. See [[#Coordinate parameters|coordinate parameters]] for details and examples.

*&lt;span id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;'''Template parameters'''&lt;/span&gt; are parameters used by the {{tl|Coord}} template.  These have format ''parameter=value'' and are separated from each other by the pipe character ( | ). The supported template parameters are ''display='', ''format='', ''name='', and ''notes=''.
:* '''display=''' can be one of the following:
::* &lt;code&gt;display=inline&lt;/code&gt; – Display the coordinate inline (default)
::* &lt;code&gt;display=title&lt;/code&gt; – Display the coordinate near the page title
::** shortcut: &lt;code&gt;display=t&lt;/code&gt;
::* &lt;code&gt;display=inline,title&lt;/code&gt; – Display the coordinate both inline and at title
::** shortcut: &lt;code&gt;display=it&lt;/code&gt;
::* &lt;code&gt;display=title,inline&lt;/code&gt; has the same effect as &lt;code&gt;display=inline,title&lt;/code&gt;
::Note: the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute indicates that the coordinates apply to the entire page, and not just one of (perhaps many) places mentioned in it &amp;mdash; so it should only be omitted in the latter case. 
:* '''format=''' can be used to force ''dec'' or ''dms'' coordinate display.
::* &lt;code&gt;format=dec&lt;/code&gt; reformats the coordinates to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;decimal degrees&lt;/span&gt; format.
::* &lt;code&gt;format=dms&lt;/code&gt; reformats the coordinates to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;degrees | minutes | seconds&lt;/span&gt; format.
:* '''name=''' can be used to annotate inline coordinates for display in map services such as the [[:meta:WikiMiniAtlas|WikiMiniAtlas]]. If omitted, the article title (PAGENAME) is assumed.
::Note: a ''name='' parameter causes {{tl|Coord}} to emit an [[w:hCard|hCard]] [[w:microformat|microformat]] using that name, ''even if used within an existing hCard''. Do not use when the name is that of a person (e.g for a gravesite), as the generated hCard would be invalid. Also, do not use square brackets in names.
:* '''notes=''' specifies text to be displayed immediately following the coordinates.  This is primarily intended for adding footnotes to title coordinates.

== Coordinate parameters ==
The first unnamed parameter following the longitude is an optional string of coordinate parameters, separated by underscores. These parameters help [[tswiki:GeoHack|GeoHack]] select suitable map resources, and they will become more important when [[m:Wikimaps|Wikimaps]] becomes fully functional.

=== type:''T'' ===
{{Coord-doc-type}}

=== scale:''N'' ===
{{Coord-doc-scale}}

=== dim:''D'' ===
{{Coord-doc-dim}}

=== region:''R'' ===
{{Coord-doc-region}}

=== globe:''G'' ===
{{Coord-doc-globe}}

=== source:''S'' ===
{{Coord-doc-source}}

==Per-user display customization==
{{UF-coord-classes}}

==Internals==
===Subtemplates===
{{Coord/sub doc}}

===Class names===
The class names '''geo''', '''latitude''' and '''longitude''' are used to generate the microformat and '''MUST NOT''' be changed.

| To add {{Coord|57|18|22.5|N|4|27|32.7|W}} to the top of a page, use {{Tl|Coord}}, thus:
:'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord|57|18|22.5|N|4|27|32.7|W|display=title}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
These [[w:Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] are in [[w:Degree (angle)|degrees]], [[w:Minute of arc|minutes]], and seconds of arc.
|-
| To add {{Coord|44.112|N|87.913|W}} to the top of a page, use either 
:'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord|44.112|N|87.913|W|display=title}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
''or''
:'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord|44.112|-87.913|display=title}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
These coordinates are in [[w:Decimal fraction|decimal]] degrees.
|-
|
* Degrees, minutes and seconds must be separated by [[w:Vertical bar|a pipe (&quot;|&quot;)]].
* [[w:Geodetic system|Map datum]] must be WGS84 (except for off-earth bodies).
* Avoid excessive precision (0.0001° is &lt;11 m, 1″ is &lt;31 m).
* Latitude (N/S) must appear before longitude (E/W).
|-
|Optional coordinate parameters follow the longitude and are separated by [[w:Underscore|an underscore (&quot;_&quot;)]]:&lt;br /&gt;
*[[Template:Coord#dim:D|dim]]: &lt;code&gt;dim:&lt;/code&gt;'''''N''''' (viewing diameter in metres)
*[[Template:Coord#region:R|region]]: &lt;code&gt;region:&lt;/code&gt;'''''R''''' ([[w:ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] or [[w:ISO 3166-2|ISO 3166-2]] code)
*[[Template:Coord#type:T|type]]: &lt;code&gt;type:&lt;/code&gt;'''''T''''' (&lt;code&gt;landmark&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;city(30,000)&lt;/code&gt;, for example)

Other optional parameters are separated by [[w:Vertical bar|a pipe (&quot;|&quot;)]]:&lt;br /&gt;
*[[Template:Coord#Display|display]]
*: {{Para|display|inline}} (the default) to display in the body of the page only,
*: {{Para|display|title}} to display in the title only, or
*: {{Para|display|inline,title}} to display in both places.
*[[Template:Coord#Name|name]]
*: &lt;code&gt;name=&lt;/code&gt;'''''X''''' to label the place on maps (default is [[mw:Help:Magic words#Page names|PAGENAME]])
Thus: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord|44.117|-87.913|dim:30_region:US-WI_type:event&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
::'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|display=inline,title|name=accident site}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''

Use {{Para|display|title}} (or {{Para|display|inline,title}}) once per page, for the subject of the page, where appropriate.

For globes other than Earth, {{tl|coord}} does not assume a specific reference system (in contrast with Earth's WGS84).  Since the template defaults to east longitude, the &lt;code&gt;|W|&lt;/code&gt; direction must be specified for globes that measure longitude westward.  At the present time, only limited mapping is available for Mars and the Moon and none for other extraterrestrial bodies.&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template namespace templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &lt;code&gt;type:&lt;/code&gt; parameter specifies the type of location for reverse mapping (for instance, to select a marker icon in the [[m:WikiMiniAtlas|WikiMiniAtlas]]).

It also sets the [[w:Scale (map)|map scale]], which can however be overridden by ''[[#dim:D|dim:]]'' or ''[[#scale:N|scale:]]''. 

Valid types are:

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &lt;code&gt;region:&lt;/code&gt; parameter specifies the political region for terrestrial coordinates.  It is used to select appropriate map resources. If no &lt;code&gt;region:&lt;/code&gt; parameter is provided, [[tswiki:GeoHack|GeoHack]] attempts to determine the region from the coordinates.

The region should be supplied as either a two character [[w:ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code or an [[w:ISO 3166-2|ISO 3166-2]] region code.

Examples of [[w:ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] codes:
{{columns-list|2;width:50%|
* '''AQ''' [[w:Antarctica|Antarctica]]
* '''AU''' [[w:Australia|Australia]]
* '''BR''' [[w:Brazil|Brazil]]
* '''CA''' [[w:Canada|Canada]]

* '''NL''' [[w:Netherlands|Netherlands]]
* '''NZ''' [[w:New Zealand|New Zealand]]
* '''RU''' [[w:Russia|Russia]]
* '''US''' [[w:United States|United States]]}}

Examples of [[w:ISO 3166-2|ISO 3166-2]] codes:
* '''NO-03''' [[w:Oslo|Oslo]], [[w:Norway|Norway]]
* '''DE-TH''' [[w:Thuringia|Thuringia]]
* '''US-NY''' [[w:New York|New York state]]

The oceans have the following Wiki assigned code elements:
* '''XN''' Arctic Ocean
* '''XA''' Atlantic Ocean
* '''XI''' Indian Ocean
* '''XP''' Pacific Ocean
* '''XS''' Southern Ocean

In addition, two Wiki assigned code elements can be used with {{tl|coord}}:
* '''XZ''' for objects in or above international waters (similar to [[w:UN/LOCODE|UN/LOCODE]]).
* '''ZZ''' for use in examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Specifies, where present, the data source and data source format/datum, and optionally the original data, presented in parentheses. This is initially primarily intended for use by geotagging robots, so that data is not blindly repeatedly copied from format to format and Wikibooks to Wikibooks, with progressive loss of precision and attributability.

Examples:
* A lat/long geotag derived from a [[w:Ordnance Survey|Ordnance Survey]] [[w:British national grid reference system|National Grid Reference]] NM&amp;nbsp;435&amp;nbsp;355 found in the English-language Wikibooks would be tagged as &quot;source:enwikibooks-osgb36(NM435355)&quot;
* A latitude-longitude location sourced from data taken from the German-language Wikibooks would be tagged as &quot;source:dewikibooks&quot; – and so on, for other language codes;
* A location sourced from the public domain [[w:GEOnet Names Server|GeoNet Names Server]] database would be tagged as &quot;source:GNS&quot;. No datum or format information is needed, since by default all Wikibooks coordinates are in latitude/longitude format based on the [[w:World Geodetic System|WGS84]] datum. Similarly, US locations sourced from the similar public domain [[w:Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] database would be tagged as &quot;source:GNIS&quot;.&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template namespace templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

&lt;!-- BE CAREFUL WITH COPY PASTING
HTMLTidy moves our whitespace around. We use &amp;#xfeff; (unicode zero width no break space/BOM) to force a space char at the end or beginning of a span to stay where it is, and this character gets lost in copypasting. This is a deprecated unicode character for these purposes, but it is the only method that works consistently around all browsers (opposed to #x2060 and #x200b).

This template, {{tl|Coord/link}}, is used by {{tl|Coord}}.

=== Examples ===
&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#123;{coord|10|N|30|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{coord|10|N|30|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#123;{coord|10|11|N|30|31|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{coord|10|11|N|30|31|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#123;{coord|10|11|12|N|30|31|32|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{coord|10|11|12|N|30|31|32|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Notes on classes===
Note: the span classes &quot;geo-default&quot;, &quot;geo-dec&quot;, and &quot;geo-dms&quot; are defined at [[MediaWiki:Common.css]].  

In addition, &quot;geo&quot; and the nested &quot;latitude&quot; and &quot;longitude&quot; have special meaning as a [[w:Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]] and so might also be used by other templates; see also http://microformats.org/wiki/geo.

===Usage===
Adds zeros to the end of ''new'' until it is the same as the negative ''original'' without its sign. Used with functions that have done ''new''=abs(''original'') and lost precision.

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord/negzeropad|original|new}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

===Example===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord/negzeropad|-1.200|1.2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; becomes {{Coord/negzeropad|-1.200|1.2}}&lt;includeonly&gt;[[Category:Template subpages|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/includeonly&gt;</text>

--
--NOTE A1: This template determines the precision of decimals
--     by counting the length of the numeric string (in a
--     #switch comparing lengths of padded strings), then
--     subtracting integer length, minus the decimal point,
--     and minus 1 if negative. For integers, 1 place is
--     subtracted for each trailing 0 on the integer.
--     For fractions, any prior count is cleared x 0, then
--     size is logarithm of denominator divided by logn 10:
--     (..prior...)*0 + floor(logn denom / logn 10 - .01) + 1.
--
--NOTE D2: The check, for whole integers, compares the amount
--     versus appending &quot;0&quot; at the end: when the amount is a
--     decimal, then the value is unchanged by appending 0 at
--     the end: so 5.23 = 5.230 is true, whereas for whole
--     integers, it would be: 5 = 50 as false, due to values
--     becoming n*10 for integer n. So, for integer n, the
--     check rejects: n = n0 as false; hence n is integer.
--
--NOTE M3: The magnitude of the integer portion is calculated
--     by logarithm of the floor of absolute value (divided by
--     [[natural logarithm]] of 10 to adjust for e=2.71828*),
--     as: ln (floor( abs({{{1|-0.050067}}}) )+0.99 )/ln10
--     Function floor(x) trims the decimal part, to leave the
--     whole count: 0-9 yield 0, 10-19 as 1, 1000-1999 as 3.
--     The abs(x) avoids floor of negatives, floor(-0.1)= -1,
--     hence using abs(x) ensures -0.1 floors to 0 not -1.
--     Near zero, the +0.99 avoids invalid log of 0, but does
--     not round-up any decimals, already floored as nnn.00.
--     Complexity is 6 operations: floor of abs( {1} ) +0.99
--     then logn div logn10, then floor that logarithm ratio.
--     Decimals -1 &lt; x &lt; 1 yield -1, avoiding log 0.001 = -3.
--
--NOTE N4: Nesting of if-else and nested templates is kept to
--     a minimum, due to the MediaWiki 1.6 limit of 40 levels
--     of if-logic for all nested templates used together.
--     Template {ordomag} was omitted to avoid 2 more levels
--     of nested templates. Template {Precision} had 8 levels,
--     and this template was trimmed to only 5 levels.
--
--NOTE S5: The #switch is run with &quot;x&quot; prepended in front of
--     the amount, otherwise a #switch will compare as numeric
--     where 2 would match &quot;2.0&quot; even though &quot;2&quot; is length 1.
--     So &quot;x2&quot; won't match &quot;x2.0&quot; in non-numeric comparison.
--     The #switch will exit on the first match, so smaller
--     lengths are compared first, to avoid extra comparisons
--     for more rare, longer numeric strings up to 41 long.
--
--NOTE W6: The check for integers with whole end-zeroes uses
--     typical n=n/10*10, for each power of 10, where whole
--     millions match: {{#ifexpr: {1}=floor( {1}/1E6 )*1E6| }}
--     Previously, {Precision} had tried to use &quot;round&quot; to
--     detect end-zeroes but &quot;round&quot; loses precision at -5,
--     so, n00000 round -5 differs from n00000 slightly, and
--     comparisons to exact rounded amounts failed to match
--     some numbers when 6 or more zeroes &quot;n000000&quot;.
--
--NOTE Z7: The check on zero for any .00000 compares adding 1
--     to the amount, versus appending &quot;1&quot; at the end: if the
--     amount is a decimal, then adding 1 will be larger than
--     appending 1 at the end: 0.00 + 1 &gt; 0.001, whereas for
--     whole zero, it would be: 0+1 &gt; 01 as false, due to the
--     value being the same. So, for integer 0, the check
--     rejects: 0+1 &gt; 01 as false; hence whole 0 is integer.

__NOTOC__
This template determines the precision (as a count of decimal digits) for any amount, large or negative, using
a fast algorithm. It can also handle a trailing decimal point (such
as &quot;15.&quot; or &quot;-41.&quot;) or trailing zeroes (such as &quot;15.34000&quot; having precision as 5 decimal digits).  For fractional input it returns the base ten logarithm of the numerator.

&lt;!--For a number in ordinary decimal notation with a decimal point, this template determines the number of digits after the point. It is a measure for the precision implied by the notation.

For multiples of non-negative powers of 10 the negative of the exponent is returned. Note however that zeros do not necessarily indicate precision, a precise number can happen to be a multiple of a power of 10.

Note that floating point values have a maximum number of digits total, so 1111111111.11111111 is equivalent to 1111111111.1111111 (one less digit after decimal point), so the output of &amp;#123;{precision}&amp;#125; for both of those is 7.

===Known bugs===
* For numbers in scientific notation, the precision is typically returned as too low by 1 decimal place. Example: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{precision |7.1234E+06}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;rarr; {{precision|7.1234E+06}} (should be precision as 4 decimal digits, not 3).
* Large numbers are limited to 11 trailing zeroes, so even larger numbers still report precision as being -11, such as 9 trillion: {&amp;#123;precision|9000000000000}} &amp;rarr; {{precision|9000000000000}} (should be: -12).

===Technical notes===
*NOTE A1: This template determines the precision of decimals by counting the length of the numeric string (in a #switch comparing lengths of padded strings), then subtracting integer length, minus the decimal point, and minus 1 if negative. For integers, 1 place is subtracted for each trailing 0 on the integer. For fractions, any prior count is cleared x 0, then returns the base ten logarithm of denominator: (..prior...)*0 + (ln denom / ln 10).
*NOTE D2: The check, for whole integers, compares the amount versus appending &quot;0&quot; at the end: when the amount is a decimal, then the value is unchanged by appending 0 at the end: so 5.23 = 5.230 is true, whereas for whole integers, it would be: 5 = 50 as false, due to values becoming n*10 for integer n. So, for integer n, the check rejects: n = n0 as false; hence n is integer.
*NOTE M3: The magnitude of the integer portion is calculated by logarithm of the floor of absolute value (divided by [[w:natural logarithm|natural logarithm]] of 10 to adjust for e=2.71828*), as: ln (floor( abs({{{1|-0.050067}}}) )+0.99 )/ln10 Function floor(x) trims the decimal part, to leave the whole count: 0-9 yield 0, 10-19 as 1, 1000-1999 as 3. The abs(x) avoids floor of negatives, floor(-0.1)= -1, hence using abs(x) ensures -0.1 floors to 0 not -1. Near zero, the +0.99 avoids invalid log of 0, but does not round-up any decimals, already floored as nnn.00. Complexity is 6 operations: floor of abs( {1} ) +0.99 then log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' (ln''x'' ÷ ln10), then floor that logarithm ratio. Decimals -1 &lt; x &lt; 1 yield -1, avoiding log 0.001 = -3.
*NOTE N4: Nesting of if-else and nested templates is kept to a minimum, due to the MediaWiki 1.6 limit of 40 levels of if-logic for all nested templates used together. Template {ordomag} was omitted to avoid 2 more levels of nested templates. Template {Precision} had 8 levels, and this template was trimmed to only 5 levels.
*NOTE S5: The #switch is run with &quot;x&quot; prepended in front of the amount, otherwise a #switch will compare as numeric where &quot;2&quot; would match &quot;2.0&quot; even though &quot;2&quot; is length 1 so &quot;x2&quot; no longer matches with &quot;x2.0&quot; as non-numeric. The #switch will exit on the first match, so smaller lengths are compared first, to avoid extra comparisons for more rare, longer numeric strings up to 41 long.
*NOTE W6: The check for integers with whole end-zeroes uses typical n=n/10*10, for each power of 10, where whole millions match: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifexpr: {1}=floor( {1}/1E6 )*1E6| }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; Previously, {Precision} had tried to use &quot;round&quot; to detect end-zeroes but &quot;round&quot; loses precision at -5, so, n00000 round -5 differs from n00000 slightly, and comparisons to exact rounded amounts failed to match some numbers when 6 or more zeroes &quot;n000000&quot;.

{{tl|precision/mini}} is very similar to {{tl|precision}}, but the output range is only 0 to 6.  Thus the functionality of {{tl|precision/mini}} is a subset of the functionality of {{tl|precision}} but the advantage is that the template code is much shorter.  It is useful when one has to be cautious of template limits.

=== Examples ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Precision/mini|111.12345678}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || {{Precision/mini|111.12345678}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Precision/mini|111.1234567}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || {{Precision/mini|111.1234567}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Precision/mini|111.123456}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || {{Precision/mini|111.123456}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Precision/mini|111.12345}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || {{Precision/mini|111.12345}}
