      <comment>Rejected the last text change (by [[Special:Contributions/59.95.34.170|59.95.34.170]]) and restored revision 2063552 by Avicennasis</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is unofficial documentation of Brunswick's Business Integration Engine - BIE, and covers version 6.04. Development from the original team seems to have stopped, and a fork was started. The fork is called [http://sourceforge.net/projects/bie-gpl/ BIE-gpl], and a beta version of 6.05 is available for download. BIE is now sold by [http://www.redberri.com/bie Redberri].

== Introduction ==
Licensed under the [http://www.fsf.org/ Free Software Foundations'] [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html The GNU General Public License], Brunswick WDI's Business Integration Engine is [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html free (as in freedom) software] and [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#TOCCommercial available at no cost]. BIE can help you transform messages and transport messages between applications which does not have these capabilities.

BIE uses a number of free (as in freedom) software components as its foundation. The original contributions to the free software community are the web application Dashboard and the Java client Map Builder.

Dashboard lets you create workflows using drag-and-drop and connectivity in and out of BIE. The Map Builder helps you set up translation from one XML schema to another.

== Installation ==
=== GNU/Linux ===
* Download BIE 6.04 for your platform from Sourceforge.net at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=79291. Choose the zipped archive file bie-linux-6.0.4.tar.gz.
* Unzip the archive file any way you like. Here is one way using a console window:
 tar xfvz bie-linux-6.0.4.tar.gz
The result is a new subdirectory called bie-linux-6.0.4.
* Change to superuser mode or root with su, enter root's password.
* Change directory to the new subdirectory and type
 ./install.sh
to install BIE. A GUI opens up, just follow the instructions given. 
* The install defaults to /usr/local/BIE.
* Check the box Start BIE
* The default user is
 admin
and the default password is
 123qwe
* You are done.

==== Files and sub directories ====
See [[/File Tree Structure/]].

== Setup ==
* Open the BIE Dashboard web application by pointing your web browser to
 http://localhost:5803/
* Log in with your user name and password.
* On the BIE Dashboard Welcome page, click Mail Settings under the System Settings menu, and give your SMTP server and email address, then hit the Save button. You may now test if BIE is able to send you an email by entering your email address in the text field, then hit the Test button, and check your email application for any new email from BIE.

== Dashboard - web application overview ==

=== System ===

==== Mail Settings ====
This lets you specify where BIE sends system notifications by email.
===== Mail Configuration =====
====== Mail Server ======
* Mail server host name - type your SMTP server in this field  
* Maximum Notification Message Size (bytes) - the default value is 51200  
* System E-Mail Address - type your email address in this field
* Use E-Mail Authentication - check this box if your SMTP server requires authentication credentials
* Authentication User Name - your SMTP user name
* Authentication Password - your SMTP password

Hit the Save button before testing.  

====== Test Mail Configuration ======
Run this test to see if your mail server is accessible by BIE
   
* Enter E-Mail Address - type your email address here

Hit the Run Test button.

==== JDBC Drivers ====
You can add database connections to BIE using JDBC drivers. BIE ships with a MySQL (won't work with new versions of MySql, e.g.:5.0,) ,  and an ODBC driver. You are using something else, you must add the appropriate driver.
===== Oracle =====
 Oracle driver can be added as follows. 
  1.	Click on the System --&gt; JDBC Drivers menu option
  2.	In the Manage JDBC Connections screen, click on “Register a Driver” link
  3.	In the “Register JDBC Driver” screen enter the parameters as follows
        a)	Driver Name : Oracle
        b)	Driver Class Name : oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
        c)	Driver Archive : ojdbc.jar 
        Click on the Register button.
  4.	Add a connection to the DUMMY schema as follows, Click on the Add Connection button against the newly registered      
        driver.
  5.	In the “Choose JDBC Driver” screen enter the values 
        a)	Select Driver :  Oracle (The driver that we added in the previous step)
        b)	Connection URL : jdbc:oracle:thin:@&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;:DUMMY
        Click on the continue button.
  6.    Set the connection properties as 
        a)  Connection Name: DUMMY
        b)  URL: jdbc:oracle:thin:@&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;:DUMMY
        c)  Username: username
        d)  Password: password
        Click on the “Save” button.
  7.	In the “Manage JDBC Connections” , we can find the newly added connection listed.
  8.    Click on the Test button next to the newly added connection .


===== MySQL =====
The MySQL JDBC driver that ships with BIE 6.04 is version 2.014, which does not appear to work with MySQL version 4.1.7 or newer. 
The latest stable MySQL JDBC driver is version 3.1.13, which may be downloaded from http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/j/
The latest driver solves the issue of connecting BIE to a MySQL on the same server, but you may need to add localhost.localdomain in the Host column to your User table in the MySQL database.

===== PostgreSQL =====

The PostgreSQL driver may be downloaded from http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html.

===== HSQLDB =====
BIE uses an internal Hypersonic database, now called HSQLDB, that contains configuration, state, and audit information. See 

===== Other JDBC drivers =====

[http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/jdbc-connection-urls Chui's counterpoint] lists a number of JDBC driver and JDBC URLs.

Some drivers like DB2 require more than one jar file. If so, just create a dummy driver for each extra jar file as a way to upload it. You may need to restart the BIE service before it notices the new jar files.

==== LDAP Connections ====
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol or LDAP is a protocol for querying directories. Here you can add your companies LDAP directory service.

==== Web Services ====

=== Workflow ===
==== Workflow ====
A common mistake/issue when trying to run a workflow, is not provide a start message.
The default config for a newly added workflow is to receive InputMessage, with the message format as StandardXML.
So, to start a worflow, you've got to provide at least a minimun xml tag, e.g.: &lt;ok/&gt;
Changing the format to StandardRaw will solve this issue.

==== Message Formats ====
BIE only understands XML, so you must express any input or output as XML schemas before you can use BIE. If you receive a file containing Comma Separated Values - CSV for short - BIE can help you generate the necessary schema.

== Map Builder - moving data between applications with XML Schemas ==
XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents. 

Map Builder is a Java application, which lets you load an input schema and output schema, and then use drag and drop to establish links between matching fields from the input schema to the output schema. Once a link is established, you may add processing instructions to the link, e.g. mathematical, logic, string operations and so on. 

The map is then saved as an XSLT transformation file, meaning it shows how input documents are converted to output documents.

=== Testing maps ===
IMPORTANT: Don't use a file with Comma Separated Values (CSV) when testing your map! A error box with the following message will appear:

 Error
 An unexpected error occurred.
 Source:
 Content is not allowed in prolog.

Hit the OK button to close the box.

CORRECT WAY: Use an XML version of the CSV file. The Dashboard can be used to generate the correct parsed XML output for a given message format. Copy and paste this parsed output to a file, and use this file for testing your map in Map Builder. See tutorial below for details.

== Tutorials ==
Some assumptions are made in the following tutorials:
* You have read the entire tutorial before proceeding, and understand that you follow the instructions at your own risk.
* You have administrator or root rights to the server where BIE is installed.
* BIE has been started. A standard installation on GNU/Linux can be started this way

 /usr/local/BIE/bin/start.sh

* You have logged into Dashboard. A standard installation regardless of platform makes the Dashboard available from the server to your browser at

 http://localhost:5803/

given the user name

 admin

and the password

 123qwe

* You have started the Map Builder. A standard installation on GNU/Linux can be started this way

 /usr/local/BIE/bin/map.sh

* You have a text editor available.

=== Lesson 1 - from CSV to XML ===
* Open your text editor
* Enter or copy and paste the following text, making sure there is a new line character between them (hit the Enter or Return key at the end of line one)
 MyName,MyAddress,MyPhone,MyCountry
 Joe Schmoe,Anywhere Street Number 1,123-456-789,Anyplace on Earth
* Save the file as Lesson1.CSV to 
 /usr/local/BIE/translation/data
* Open the Dashboard, select Workflow from the top menu, then select the menu item Message Formats
* Under the heading Configurations, select type Delimited from the drop-down menu, then hit the &quot;add new&quot; button.
* In the Name field write
 Lesson1
* Set the Process Header radio button to On
* Change the Root tag to
 Lesson1
* Hit the save button.
* In the Format column under Configurations, you will now see a link named Lesson1 - hit it.
* A new form is now available, called Format Testing / Schema Generation.
* In the &quot;Select a local file&quot; field, enter or select through the browse button the address to Lesson1.CSV
 /usr/local/BIE/translation/data/Lesson1.CSV
* Hit the &quot;Run Formatter/Generator&quot; button.
* A new three part form is now available:
:* Generated schema. Give the name 
 Lesson1.xsd
in the text field. DON'T HIT THE &quot;Save to Server&quot; button just yet.
:* Parsed Ouput - a BIE typo, should be Parsed Output. Select the parsed XML output, copy, and paste into a new file in your text editor. Save the file as 
 Lesson1.xml
:* NOW you can hit the &quot;Save to Server&quot; button. We did it this way to avoid back-button browser problems.
* Open Map Builder, and hit the &quot;Create a new map&quot; button in the top left corner. The steps is outlined to the left, and you can you select
 Lesson1.xsd
as your source schema, then hit the Next button.
* Select Lesson1 as the source schema's root element, and hit the Next button
* Select the suggested File Name for the base path for source includes/imports by hitting the Next button
* Select
 Lesson1.xsd
as your target schema. Yes, it's the same one, but for the purposes of this lesson it will do. Hit the Next button.
* Select Lesson1 as the target schema's root element, and hit the Next button.
* Select the suggested File Name for the base path for source includes/imports by hitting the Next button.
* Save the map file to the map folder with the file name
 Lesson12Lesson1.xml
by hitting the Finish button.
* The map is loaded with the source schema's fields on the left, and the destination schema's fields on the right.
* Click the source schema's row icon and hold down the mouse button while moving it to the destination schema's row icon before you let the mouse button go. You should now a blue link between the two schemas.
* Repeat the linking process - MyName to MyName, MyAddress to MyAddress, MyPhone to MyPhone, MyCountry to MyCountry.
* Hit the Compile XSLT button from the tool bar.
* Hit the Test XSLT transformation button, and select
 Lesson1.xml
* The Save result dialog opens, change the file name to
 Lesson1_transformed.xml
and hit the Save button.
* Open your text editor, and load the file
 Lesson1_transformed.xml
You should see that the data from the source fields have been accurately mapped to destination fields.
* Right-click the MyName field in the source schema and select Unlink. Do the same with MyAddress.
* Now link the source field MyName to the destination field MyAddress. Link the source field MyAddress to the destination field MyName.
* Save the new map.
* Compile the new map.
* Test XSLT transformation using
 Lesson1.xml
as the source file and save the result as Lesson1_transformed_again.xml
* Open
 Lesson1_transformed_again.xml
in your text editor. You should see that Joe Schmoe is now in the MyAddress field, and his address has become his name.

Lesson1 is now over. You should try BIE to find what works or not. Come back here and create new lessons. :-)

=== Lesson 2 - creating a workflow ===
In Lesson 1 you learned how to create a map between one XML Schema to another in Map Builder, and to test the transformation. The point of BIE is to automate these kinds of mappings, and that is what we are going to do in this lesson. This time we will be mostly working in the Dashboard, creating a workflow. 

To be continued... In the interim, please look at the JonesPubPO workflow.

=== Lesson 3 - validate input against DTD ===
=== Lesson X - setting up EDI of encrypted documents ===
An idea for a future lesson:

Health professionals exchange sensitive patient information electronically using encrypted XML Schemas. Referrals and reports are transported by the thousands every single day of the year. This lesson will describe the use of GNU Privacy Guard, perhaps Idealx X.509 Certificate Authority and BIE for this purpose.

==Description==

* Sen (س) makes the [s] sound as in &quot;see&quot;. Never pronounce it like a [z]. In English we often mix our [z] and [s] sounds subconsciously.
* Sħen (ش) makes the [ʃ] sound as in &quot;she&quot;. It is often spelled &quot;sh&quot; in English, but has several other spellings too.
* Sžaad (ص) makes the emphatic [sˁ] sound. Refer to the description of emphatic sounds in [[Arabic/LearnRW/Row_2|Row 2]].
* Džaad (ض) makes the [d̪ˁ] sound.&lt;ref&gt;Often pronounced as a [zˁ] in non-standard dialects&lt;/ref&gt; It is the same as د, only emphatic.
* Qaaf (ق) makes the [q] sound — another non-English sound. It is similar to [k], but it is pronounced further back in the mouth, almost touching the very back.
* Laam (ل) makes the [l] sound as in &quot;lip&quot;. It might actually be [l̪], in which case it would be pronounced further forward that the English version, with the tip of the tongue on the back of the teeth.
* Non (ن) makes the [n] sound as in &quot;now&quot;.

== 2. Define the following terms ==
=== Hardware ===
Hardware is any physical portion of a computing device, such as memory, motherboard etc

=== Software ===
Software is a term describing a set of instructions that control the operation of a computer.    Software can be easily changed and updated.  Once it has been created, it can be reproduced very cheaply.  This is because software is not something that can be touched or held in a person's hand.   The media on which the software is written can be touched, but the media does not generally look any different after the software is written to it.  Software can be stored on many types of media, and can in fact be distributed without the use of a storage medium (other than its final storage destination on a computer's hard drive).

=== Floppy Disk ===
A floppy disk is a removable storage media for computers.  It consists of a plastic disk coated with a magnetic material encased in a plastic sheath.  Data can be stored on them by changing the magnetic properties of very tiny areas on the disk.  The data can be read back by detecting these magnetic fields.  Floppy disks are no longer in widespread use, having been replaced by writable CD Roms, flash drives, and computer networks.  In their heyday, they were used for distributing software, exchanging data between computers, data storage, and for data archival.

=== Hard drive ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Hard drive}}

=== Mainframe ===
A mainframe is a large, powerful computer shared by many users.  It is generally located someplace in a building separate from where its users are.  The users of a mainframe connect to it through a terminal consisting of a keyboard and a monitor.  A mainframe can be connected to many terminals - and therefore - many users at a time.  The terminals are connected to the mainframe by a network.   Some terminals are also equipped with a mouse and speakers.  Full access to a mainframe is usually reserved for the system administrator who is responsible for installing software, performing maintenance, and creating user accounts.  Regular mainframe users generally do not have privileges to install new software or alter files belonging to other users.

=== Desktop Computer ===
A desktop computer is a small computer system that is dedicated to a small number of users.  This type of computer is often found in homes and offices and is capable of running stand-alone (that is, in the absence of another computer such as a mainframe).  Desktop computers do not take up a lot of space, but they are not easy to move from one location to another (like a laptop).

=== Laptop Computer ===
A laptop computer is a small, portable computer.  They are generally not as powerful as desktop computers selling for the same amount.  Laptops come in a &quot;clamshell&quot; design, such that the video display can be folded down over the keyboard when the computer is not in use, or when it is transported.  The circuitry is located beneath the keyboard.  Laptops are designed to maximize battery life and minimize size and weight.

=== ROM ===
ROM is an acronym that stands for Read Only Memory.  This is a form of computer memory whose contents cannot be altered except when it is manufactured.  It is typically used to store a computer's boot program.  The boot program is the first program to execute when a computer is turned on, and it typically loads an operating system into main (writable) memory from some other storage media (such as a harddrive, cd rom drive, or network).

=== RAM ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/RAM}}

=== Alphanumeric ===
The set of all letters and numbers.  An alphanumeric value is any string made up of only letters and numbers.  For instance, &quot;a12bgj&quot;, &quot;1234&quot;, and &quot;ABCD&quot; are all alphanumeric, whereas &quot;aB$4&quot; is not (it contains the '$' symbol which is neither a letter nor a number).
=== CPU ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/CPU}}
=== Circuit Board ===
A circuit board is a stiff sheet of material upon which various components of a circuit are soldered.  It supplies the connections between the components as well as a platform on which they are mounted.  
=== Cursor ===
The cursor is a visual indicator on a computer display.  It shows where on the display the next keyboard entry will be made.  In a graphical system, the cursor may be moved around the screen with a mouse.  In a text system, the cursor may be moved around using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
=== Port ===
A port is an external connection on a computer.  It provides a connection to an external device such as a mouse, keyboard, printer, external modem, camera, or other device.
=== Program ===
A program is a series of computer instructions that when executed performs a predetermined task.
=== DOS or OS ===
OS stands for &quot;Operating System&quot; and DOS stands for &quot;Disk Operating System.&quot;  An operating system is a program that coordinates the rest of the computer.  It allows other programs to run and generally provides an easy mechanism for other programs to access various hardware devices on the computer.  A Disk operating system is an operating system that is loaded from a harddrive or floppy drive.  
=== CD Rom ===
A CD Rom is a type of computer storage medium.  &quot;CD ROM&quot; stands for &quot;Compact Disc, Read Only Memory&quot;.  These devices were originally developed for storing music, but were pressed into service for storing all kinds of computer data after their initial introduction.  A typical CD Rom can store approximately 650 megabytes of data.  The data on a CD Rom is read from the disc by a laser beam in a CD Rom drive.

== 3. What are the proper handling and storage techniques for disks? ==
Disks should be stored away from devices that create magnetic fields such as speakers and video monitors.  They should be kept free from dust and moisture, and should not be bent or folded.  Care should be taken to not scratch compact discs.

== 4. Describe the function of and point out the following components of a personal computer ==
=== Keyboard ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Keyboard}}


=== Monitor ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Monitor}}


=== System Unit or Central Processing Unit ===
The system unit is the part of a computer that contains the microprocessor, memory, and hardrive.  It is the &quot;main&quot; component of a desktop computer system or a mainframe.  All other devices (such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.) plug into it.  It is sometimes also called the &quot;Central Processing Unit,&quot; although that term is also used to describe the microprocessor.

=== Printer ===
A computer printer is a device which records computer output to paper.  Printers come in many forms as described in a later section.

=== Disk Drive ===
A disk drive is a device which stores data onto a platter (the disc) which has been coated with a magnetically sensitive material.  Data on a disk drive can be stored for long periods of time even when the device is powered off.  There are two types of disk drives: hard drives and floppy drives.

== 5. Know the difference between and uses for the following printers: ==
=== Letter Quality ===

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A letter-quality printer was a form of computer impact printer that was able to print with the quality typically expected from a business typewriter such as an IBM Selectric.

Over time, several different technologies were used including automating ordinary typebar typewriter mechanisms (such as the Friden Flexowriter), automating IBM Selectric mechanisms (such as the IBM 2741 terminal), and, finally, the daisy wheel printer. The Selectric-based and daisy wheel printers offered the additional advantage that the typeface was readily changeable by the user to accommodate varying needs.

Because of its low cost, the daisy wheel printer became the most successful of the three types. Most letter quality printers were available either as complete computer terminals with keyboards or as print-only devices.

Nowadays, printers using non-impact printing (for example laser printers, inkjet printers, and other similar means) have replaced traditional letter-quality printers in most applications.

=== Dot Matrix ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A dot matrix printer or impact matrix printer refers to a type of computer printer with a print head that runs back and forth on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a typewriter. Unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.

Each dot is produced by a tiny metal rod, also called a &quot;wire&quot; or &quot;pin&quot;, which uses the power of a tiny electromagnet or solenoid to drive it forward, either directly or through small levers.  

In the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix impact printers were generally considered the best combination of expense and versatility, and until the 1990s they were by far the most common form of printer used with personal computers.

=== Laser ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Laser printer}}

=== Plotter ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Plotters print their output by moving a pen across the surface of a piece of paper. This means that plotters are restricted to line art, rather than raster graphics as with other printers. They can draw complex line art, including text, but do so very slowly because of the mechanical movement of the pens. (Plotters are incapable of creating a solid region of color; but can hatch an area by drawing a number of close, regular lines.)

Plotters are used primarily in technical drawing and CAD applications, where they have the advantage of working on very large paper sizes while maintaining high resolution. Another use has been found by replacing the pen with a cutter, and in this form plotters can be found in many garment and sign shops.

=== Ink Jet ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Ink jet printer}}

=== Thermal ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A thermal printer (or direct thermal printer) produces a printed image by selectively heating coated paper when the paper passes over the thermal print head. The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image. Two-color direct thermal printers are capable of printing both black and an additional color (often red), by applying heat at two different temperatures.

Thermal printers are often faster and quieter than dot matrix printers.  They are also more economical than other types of printers since their only consumable is the paper itself. Possible  applications of thermal printers include filling station pumps, information kiosks, and cash register systems.  Thermal printers are useful anywhere low cost is more important than high quality.

== 6. Show or describe how to protect a computer system from dust, dirt, static electricity, power surges and outages, or other potentially dangerous factors that could hamper or hurt a computer system. ==
=== Dirt and Dust ===
One way to protect a computer from dust and dirt is to locate it in an area where there is little dust or no dirt at all.  A computer should be elevated off the floor.  It can be stored on a desk, or even on top of a block of wood - getting it even an inch or two off the floor will prevent it from accumulating much dust.

=== Static Electricity ===
Computer circuitry can be damaged by static electricity.  One generally doesn't have to worry about that too much as long as the cover of the computer is on.  However, when installing a new card in a PC, adding an internal hard drive, or performing any maintenance that requires one to remove the cover, care must be taken to discharge static electricity.  This can best be done by wearing an anti-static wrist strap while handling components.  One end of the strap is worn around the wrist, and the other is connected to the same electrical ground that the computer is connected to.  However, not all computer users own an anti-static strap.  In those cases, other precautions can be taken to avoid static discharge into the electronic components.  One way this his can be done is by touching the metal frame of the computer before touching any of the sensitive electronic components inside.

When installing new components into a computer, the component should be left in its protective packaging until it is ready to be inserted into the computer.  Touch the package first, then remove the component.  If not wearing a wrist strap, touch the computer's frame next, and then install the component.

=== Power Surges and Outages ===
Computers should be protected from power surges by plugging them into a surge protector.  These can be purchased at computer stores, office supply stores, or even hardware stores.  A surge protector will not protect a computer from a power outage though.  For that, an uninterruptible power supply (or UPS) can be used.  An UPS is a device that will continue to supply electrical power to the computer for a short while after the power fails.  Some UPS's can supply power for hours, while others can supply power for only a few minutes - long enough to shut the computer down to prevent loss of data.  A good UPS can tell the computer when it has lost its primary source of power and instruct the computer to shut itself down when backup power is nearly spent.

=== Other Dangers ===
Be careful about eating or drinking around a computer.  It is easy to drop food crumbs into a computer keyboard, and more than one computer has been destroyed by a spilled drink.  Don't set a drink down next to a computer, or worse yet, on a shelf or desk above the computer.  It is best to keep these things away from the computer, but if that cannot be avoided, they should be placed in a position such that a spill is unlikely to reach the computer.

Computers should be protected from other forms of liquid as well - if the roof begins to leak, unplug the computer and move it to a dry area.  

Do not drop a computer.  Some of the components are easily damaged by the shock, especially those components with moving parts such as disk drives.  A sharp jolt to a computer may also dislodge components, bend connectors, or in severe cases, break solder joints.

Operate a computer in a cool environment.  Excessive heat can damage a computer or cause it to lose stability.  Programs can misbehave, and memories and other devices can fail in high temperature environments.  

When transporting a computer, pack it appropriately.  Laptops should be carried in special bags made for that purpose.  Desktop systems should be boxed in their original packaging when possible.  If transporting a monitor by car, place the screen against the back of the seat.  The front of the screen is the heaviest side of the monitor, so placing it against the back of the seat will make it less likely to slide around, as well as protect the screen from other objects that might fly around (such as a keyboard!) during a sudden stop.

== 7. Name at least four input devices for computers ==
* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Digital Camera
* Scanner
* Microphone
* Network Interface Card
* Modem
* Flash Drive
* Floppy Drive
* CD Rom Drive
* Frame Grabber

== 8. What does it mean to back up a disk or a file?  Why is it important? ==
Backing up a disk or a file means making another copy of it.  Although computers are highly reliable machines, they are not perfect.  Floppy discs can be lost or damaged.  All hard drives will eventually fail.  When this happens, it can be difficult, expensive, and even impossible to recover the data that was stored on them.  For this reason, all important data should be backup up.  This can be accomplished by copying it to another computer, burning the data onto a CD Rom, copying it to a floppy drive, a second hard drive, or a flash drive.  In some cases, a file can be backed up by emailing it to oneself so that the data is stored on an email server, although in this case, care must be taken that the data really is stored on a different computer.

== 9. What is computer preventative maintenance?  Why is it important? ==
=== Guard Against Malicious Software ===
There are many things a computer user can do to keep the computer running smoothly.  The most important is to prevent the computer from getting infected with a virus, a worm, or spyware.  Many places on the internet will entice the user to download malicious software, so computer users should be especially careful.  An infected computer system can get so bogged down with junk programs that it is virtually inoperable.  Sometimes the only way to &quot;cure&quot; it is by performing a complete reinstall of all the programs and the operating system.  Anti-virus and firewall software can be an effective means to protect a computer from malicious software.

=== Security Updates ===
Software vendors often issue security updates to the software they provide.  Often, a vulnerability  in a program is discovered, and the software vendor fixes the problem an issues an update.  These updates should be applied as soon as possible (or better - automatically) because there are other people in the world who are watching for these updates with evil intent.  As soon as the security update is announced, these individuals will attempt to develop a program to exploit the vulnerability.  These programs, once they have breached a computer, usually put the computer to work looking for ''other'' vulnerable computers, and thus, the infection spreads.  Do not believe that because you are an anonymous person, your computer will not be affected.  These programs do not care ''who'' you are - they are only concerned that your ''computer'' is vulnerable.  Sometimes these programs only attempt to spread themselves around.  Other times, they can install themselves invisibly, log the user's keystrokes, and forward them to the author of the malicious program.  In these cases, the program is looking for sensitive information about ''you'': bank account numbers, social security numbers, etc.  Keep your computer software secured and up to date!

=== Defragment the Hard Drive ===
Another thing a computer user can do to tune the computer's performance is to defragment the hard drive.  This operation puts all the data from each file sequentially on the hard drive, so it can be accessed more quickly.  A computer can store data from single file in locations physically scattered all over the drive.  The data is still presented to the computer as if it were stored sequentially - it just takes it a lot longer to collect all that information.

=== Dust Bunnies Inside ===
A computer should be dusted any time it is opened.  Dust can be blown out using a can of compressed air.  Care should be taken when this operation is performed - the dust can easily fly back into the maintainers face and get into the eyes.  Be careful that all fans are operating properly after they are cleaned.  Cooling fans often fail immediately after they are cleaned. One should also check under the cooling fan to make sure the fins of the heat sink are clean.  If the heatsink is plugged up with dirt and grime the processor will overheat.

== 10. Successfully boot, load (install), and use a prepared software program for use in a computer system. (No computer games.) ==
There are many programs that can be used to meet this requirement.  Some programs can be purchased at a store, and others can be downloaded for free (legally!) from the Internet.  Some excellent programs that can be downloaded for free include [http://openoffice.org OpenOffice] (an Office suite with a word processor, spread sheet, presentation program, and drawing package), [http://getfirefox.com Firefox] (a web browser), [http://getthunderbird.com Thunderbird] (an email program), and [http://gimp.org The Gimp] (a photo/image editing program).  All of these programs are of excellent quality and compare very favorably to their commercial counterparts.  Best of all, they are FREE.

== 11. Tell several ways an individual or family could use a personal computer other than for games. ==
Tracking finances, staying in contact with other family members, record keeping, making documents, producing web pages, connecting to the Internet, researching a school (or work) assignment, getting directions, finding lost friends, downloading pathfinder honors requirements and answers, and many, many more!

==Description==

These letters have the hook tail which looks like this: L. Remember tails only show up in the end and the lonely form of the letter. 

* Jem (ج) makes the [d͡ʒ] sound.&lt;ref&gt;In some dialects this is pronounced as [ɡ] as in &quot;good&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In English this is usually written as &quot;j&quot; as in &quot;Julliet&quot;. With a good Arabic accent it sounds slightly different than the English version of this sound.

* Hžaa (ح) makes [ħ], a non-English sound. People who are new to Arabic often confuse it with [h], the sound that the letter ه (haa) makes. Although they sound similar, they are different. ح (Hžaa) is pronounced further up in the throat. To produce this sound, leave your mouth open and constrict your throat a bit. Then breath out. It will sound something like the noise Darth Vader makes when he breaths. All Arabs pronounce this properly; mispronouncing this letter will make  your Arabic very difficult to understand. Never pronounce it the same as خ (kħaa). Some beginners make this mistake.

* Kħaa (خ) makes [x], a non-English sound. Many languages have this sound. German has it in the &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;Bach&quot;, Russian has it in the &quot;ch&quot; of Rachmaninoff, and Scottish English has it in the &quot;ch&quot; of &quot;loch.&quot; It is similar to the sound people make when preparing to spit.

* Rħayn (ع) makes [ʕ], a non-English sound. Non-Arabs confuse it with ء (hamza), the glottal stop. Rħayn is the voiced version of ح (Hžaa). It is often referred to as the &quot;choking sound&quot;, it sounds like an odd sort of growl. Mispronouncing this sound will make you incomprehensible in Arabic.

* Gayn (غ) makes [ɣ], a non-English sound. It is the voiced version of خ (khaa). It is similar to the sound everyone makes when they gargle water. In Arabic, the tongue is somewhere between the location [k] (ك) and [q] (ق).

== Description ==
The following two letters are often called emphatic. This means that the sound is both pharyngealized and partly velarized. The very back of the tongue is pushed against the back of the throat. In layman's terms, think of pronouncing the sound while simultaneously choking yourself. Phonetically, we write this by adding ˁ right after the sound.

* Tžaa (ط) makes the [t̪ˁ] sound, like the 't', only emphatic.
* Dhžaa (ظ) makes the [ðˁ] sound, like the 'th' in &quot;either&quot;, only emphatic.

==Extension Development==
The most comprehensive site for Extension development is at the Mozillazine Knowledge Base found [http://kb.mozillazine.org/Extension_development here]. Other helpful tools include the [http://www.mozilla.org/projects/inspector/ DOM Inspector] included in Firefox and the JavaScript console. 

Firefox is especially developer-friendly.  It allows even the most casual web developer to crib useful HTML techniques from most any website they visit, and offers a host of other features for more serious users.

==Source viewing==
Perhaps the most-used development feature is the ability to highlight images and text in any website, and choose to view source from a drop-down menu.  When this feature is used, Firefox displays the HTML source that was used to generate the highlighted content.  

For instance, highlighting the above paragraph and section heading, right clicking, and choosing &quot;''Vi&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;w Selection Source''&quot;, will display the following in a new window:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;Source_viewing&quot; id=&quot;Source_viewing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Source viewing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most-used development feature is the ability to highlight images and text in any website, and choose &quot;&lt;i&gt;View selection source&lt;/i&gt;&quot; from the drop-down menu. Doing this will bring up a pop-up window, with the HTML source that was used to generate the highlighted content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Combining this technique with a good markup language reference source, such as the [[Main_Page|Wikibook]] [[HTML Programming]], will allow you to learn from every new website you visit.

==Epidemiology==
The overall incidence of symptomatic acoustic neuromas is 1/100,000 persons, however, autopsy results have shown that subclinical acoustic neuromas are present in up to 1% of people.  Acoustic neuromas account for ~8% of intracranial tumors and 80-90% of CPA tumors.  Most people with symptomatic acoustic neuromas will present between the ages of 30 and 50.  
They are almost always unilateral; bilateral acoustic neuromas are limited to patients with NF-2.  

==Risk Factors==
*Acoustic trauma: OR of 2.2 if 10 years exposure to extremely loud noise, OR of 13.1 if 20 or more years of exposure.  
*Parathyroid adenoma: OR of 3.4 for acoustic neuromas.  
*NF-2: Accounts for 10% of patients with acoustic neuroma, typically bilateral.  Recall that NF2 gene is a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes a membrane cytoskeletal protein called merlin or schwannomin that appears to be involved in actin-cytoskeleton organization.  NF2 associated with bilateral ANs, gliomas, meningiomas, cataracts, and neurofibromas.

==Pathology==
Acoustic neuromas arise from the Schwann cell perineural elements of the affected nerve and occur with equal frequency on the superior and inferior branches of the vestibular nerve (rarely affect the cochlear portion of CN VIII).  They arise at the junction of the central myelin produced by glial cells and peripheral myelin produced by Schwann cells (Obersteiner-Redlich zone).  On light microscopy one will see zones of alternately dense and sparse cellularity called Antoni A and B areas, respectively.  Acoustic neuromas will also stain positive for the S100 protein. 
  
==Natural History==
The natural history of acoustic neuromas is variable.  The average growth rate is 1.9mm/year.  40% of tumors overall (higher for smaller tumors) will show no growth or even shrinkage on serial images.   However, there is no predictive relation between growth rate and size of tumor at presentation.  

==Clinical Presentation==
The symptoms involved with acoustic neuroma are due to cranial nerve involvement and tumor progression.  
*Acoustic nerve: Symptomatic involvement in 95% of patients, major symptoms being hearing loss and tinnitus.  Hearing loss present in 95%, but only about 66% were actually aware of this deficit.  The hearing loss is usually chronic (over years).  Tinnitus is present in 63% of patients.  
*Vestibular nerve: Involved in 61% of patients and manifests as mild to moderate unsteadiness while walking.  True spinning vertigo is uncommon due to the slow growing nature of these tumors.  
*Trigeminal nerve: Disturbance occurs in 17% of patients with symptoms such as facial numbness, hypesthesia, and pain.  These symptoms usually occur after hearing loss is present for more than two years, and vestibular symptoms for more than one year.  
*Facial nerve: Involved in 6% of patients.  Seen as facial paresis and taste disturbances.           
*Posterior fossa:  Compression on the cerebellum or brainstem results in ataxia.  May also see serious complications such as brainstem compression, cerebellar tonsillar herniation, hydrocephalus, and death.  

==Work-up==
[[Image:Tumor_Acoustic_Neuroma.JPG|thumb]]
*Physical Exam: 
**Confirm sensorineural hearing loss with Rinne test (tuning fork on mastoid bone, AC&gt;BC) and Weber test (vibratory sound louder on the “good” side)
**Also check for other CN deficits (absent corneal reflex, facial twitching, hypesthesia)
*Audiometry: 
**The best initial screening test
**Typically shows asymmetric SHL, usually more prominent in the higher frequencies. Functional hearing typically described as &lt;50 dB and &gt;50% speech discrimination
**Hearing loss does not necessarily correlate with tumor size.
*Brainstem auditory evoked potentials: Delay in conduction time on the affected side.  
*Imaging: MRI with gadolinium can detect tumors as small as 1-2mm.  Seen as an enhancing lesion “ice cream cone” in the region of internal acoustic canal or a “dumbbell” extending into the foramen magnum.

==Treatment==
The three treatment options for acoustic neuroma are surgery, radiation therapy, and observation.

==Surgery==
Typically performed by an otologist and a neurosurgeon.  The learning curve is very steep, on the order of 20-60 cases.  There are three surgical approaches used in the removal of acoustic neuromas.  
*Retromastoid suboccipital: An incision is made behind the ear and the mastoid bone and some inner ear structures are removed.  Advantages to this approach include decreased risk of facial nerve damage and ability to attempt hearing preservation.  A disadvantage is that using this approach, if the tumor extends distally into the IAC, complete removal may not be possible.
*Middle fossa: This approach involves an incision just anterior to the ear with removal of the underlying bone to expose the area of interest.  Hearing preservation is attempted with this approach, but depending on location of the tumor complete removal may not be feasible.  
*Translabyrinthine: This approach goes directly through the inner ear and invariably sacrifices hearing.
Results: Anatomic preservation of the facial nerve is achieved in 93% of patients and of the cochlear nerve in 68%.  Hearing preservation rate for surgery is 47%.
Complications of surgery: Death (1%), hemiparesis (1%), CN palsey (5%), hematomas (2.2%), CSF fistulas (9.2%), hydrocephalus (2.3%), bacterial meningitis (1.2%), wound revisions (1.1%).
(Samii, Neurosurgery 1997 Jan;40(1):11-21)

==Radiosurgery==
GKS--Patient’s head is fixed in MRI compatible Leksell stereotactic frame and 1-1.5mm slice MRI is obtained.  Prescribe dose of 12.5-13.0 Gy to the 50% isodose line.  TV defined as macroscopic tumor seen on MRI/CT.  Evaluate dose fall-off to cochlea and brain stem.  Tumor control rate (97%), Normal facial function (&gt;99%), Trigeminal function (97%), Hearing preservation (up to 77%). (Lunsford, J Neurosurg 2005 Jan;102 Suppl:195-9)

Proton Beam Radiosurgery--Now only used for pts with non-serviceable hearing and tumors &lt;2.0cm.  Use 3 fiducial markers in the outer table of the cranium, as well as placement of head in a stereotactic frame.  A 3D CT based planning system is used.  160 MeV proton beam is used to administer 3 converging beams to a max dose of 13 cobalt Gray equivalents to TV.   Evaluate dose fall-off to brainstem and cochlea.   Excellent tumor control (95%) and preservation of CNs V (89%) and VII (91%)  Hearing preservation: 33%. (Weber, Neurosurgery 2003 Sep;53(3):577-86)

Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy--Patient’s head is immobilized in a mask and linear accelerator is used to apply the radiation.  Dose: 50-55 Gy in 25-30 fractions to the 80% isodose line.  The data for FSR has shown excellent tumor control, preservation of hearing/CN function, and reduced treatment related toxicity. (Combs, IJROBP 2005 Sep 1; 63 (1):75-81)

==Observation==
In certain cases it may be feasible to observe the patient and his/her VS with MRI scans every 6-12 months.  Problems with this approach include ongoing hearing loss, and possible mass effects with large tumors.


==External Beam RT==

**Retrospective. 89 patients. Two dose levels: 50.4 Gy vs 46.8 Gy. Median F/U 4.4 and 5.4 years
**Outcome: Tumor control 100% both groups.
**Toxicity: Raw 3-year hearing preservation 46.8 Gy 79% vs. 50.4 Gy 68% (SS). Pure tone hearing better in low-dose cohort 46.8 Gy 33db vs. 50.4 Gy 40 db (SS). Actuarial hearing preservation rate significantly longer for low-dose group 3.2 years vs. 1.5 years (SS). Predictors for hearing dose cohort and pretreatment hearing class
**Conclusion: Lower dose of 46.8 Gy had 100% local control with better hearing preservation rate

*'''Harvard; 2005''' (1992-2001) PMID 15987541 -- &quot;Stereotactic radiotherapy for vestibular schwannomas: favorable outcome with minimal toxicity.&quot; (Chan AW, Neurosurgery. 2005 Jul;57(1):60-70; discussion 60-70.)
**Retrospective. 70 patients (new 47%, progressive after observation 31%, postop 3%, recurrent 19%), NF2 in 11 patients. Treated with linac SRT. Median dose 54/30 to 95% isodose. Median tumor volume 2.4 cm3. Median F/U 3.8 years
**Outcome: 3-year LC 100%, 5-year LC 98%. Freedom from resection 98% and 92%. Initial tumor volume predictive of resection: 5-year FFR if &lt;8 cm3 97% vs. &gt;8 cm3 47%. No difference due to NF2 status
**Toxicity: 3-year facial nerve 99%, trigeminal nerve 96%. Prior surgery predictive of TN toxicity (86% vs. 98%)
**Conclusion: Conventionally fractionated SRT results in very favorable outcome

**Retrospective. 75 pts with Gamma Knife, 25 with microsurgery. 
**No difference in tumor control. RS more effective in: preservation of measurable hearing (57% vs 14%). Microsurgery had higher rate of: facial neuropathy (35%/6%) and trigeminal neuropathy (22%/12%). Also no difference in: serviceable hearing, tinnitus, imbalance, dysarthria, dysphagia, and headache. Longer hospital stay and more perioperative complications (47% vs 4%) for microsurgery.

==Comparison of SRS and FSRT==
*'''Amsterdam; 2003''' PMID 12873685 -- &quot;Single-fraction vs. fractionated linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: a single-institution study.&quot; (Meijer OW, IJROBP. 2003 Aug 1;56(5):1390-6).  129 patients with ANs from 1992-1999 were prospectively selected for SRS or FSRT based on whether or not they had teeth.  All treatments were linac based.  The dentate patients received FSRT (20Gy/5fx and 25Gy/5fx) and the edentate patients received SRS (10Gy and 12.5Gy).  Mean follow-up was 33 months.  Results in table below.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|               || Tumor Control || CN V preservation|| CN VII Perservation || Hearing Preservation || 
|- 
| SRS          || 100%                      || 92% || 93% || 75% || 
|-
| FSRT     || 94%                        || 98% || 97% || 61% || 
|}
**Conclusion: Comparable rate of tumor control and preservation of hearing, CN V, and CN VII.  

*'''Thomas Jefferson; 2001''' (1994-2000) PMID 11483338 -- &quot;Stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of acoustic schwannomas: comparative observations of 125 patients treated at one institution.&quot; (Andrews, IJROBP.  2001 Aug 1;50(5):1265-78).
**Retrospective. 122 patients (GKS 69, fractionated 52). GKS dose 12 Gy, fractionated dose 50/25. Mean F/U 2.3 years
**Outcome: tumor control SRS 98% vs. FSRT 97% (NS)
**Toxicity: CN V preservation 95% vs. 93% (NS), CN VII preservation 98% vs. 98% (NS); functional hearing 33% vs. 81% (SS)
**Conclusions: Comparable rates of tumor control and CN preservation, improvement in servicable hearing

==Proton Therapy==
*'''Harvard; 2003''' (1992-2000) PMID 12943574 -- &quot;Proton beam radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: tumor control and cranial nerve toxicity.&quot; (Weber DC, Neurosurgery. 2003 Sep;53(3):577-86; discussion 586-8.)
**Retrospective. 88 patients, proton SRS. Median volume 1.4 cm3. Prior surgery 17%. Facial nerve function normal 90%, good/excellent hearing 9%, servicable hearing 15%. Median dose 12 CGE (10-18 CGE) prescribed to median 70% isodose line. Median F/U 3.2 years
**Outcome: 5-year LC 94%, radiological reduction in 95%
**Toxicity: In GR Grade 1-2, 33% retained servicable (GR Grade 2) hearing. 5-year normal facial nerve 91% and trigeminal nerve 89%. Facial neuropathy predicted by prescribed dose, maximum dose, and inhomogeneity
**Conclusion: Proton beam SRS effective treatment, reduced prescribed dose associated with decrease in facial neuropathy

*'''Loma Linda; 2002''' (1991-1999) PMID 11844261 -- &quot;Fractionated proton beam radiotherapy for acoustic neuroma.&quot; (Bush DA, Neurosurgery. 2002 Feb;50(2):270-3; discussion 273-5.)
**Retrospective. 31 ANs in 30 patients. Mean tumor volume 4.3 cm3. If useful hearing, 54 CGE, if no hearing 60 CGE. Mean F/U 2.8 years
**Outcome: 0% progression, 38% regression

Hi,

Garrett hasn't been around for a couple weeks, but I'll take care of it. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

All these letters are non-connectors. They have two forms: connected (being connected to), non-connected (not being connected to).

* Alif (ا) has several uses. The first is that whenever a word begins with a vowel it begins with an alif. The second use of it is the long &quot;aa&quot; sound as in &quot;bat&quot;. The second use of it occurs when the alif is plain and does not begin a word. The third use is indicating the glottal stop, but this usually requires a diacritic.
* Daal (د) makes the [‎d̪] sound. In the same way as the ت in [[Arabic/LearnRW/Row_4|Row 4]], this is very similar to the English 'd' with some minor differences.
* Dħaal (ذ) makes the [ð] sound. In English, this is like &quot;th&quot; in &quot;weather&quot;, not the one in &quot;think&quot;.
* Raa' (ر) sounds like [r], the trilled &quot;r&quot; sound. This sound does not exist in standard English, but it is used sometimes in 'proper' British English. It is the same as the 'r' in Italian or Latin. It is not the same &quot;r&quot; sound as in standard English, but one can still be understood pronouncing it as such.
* Zay (ز) makes the [z] sound, like the first sound in &quot;zap&quot;.
* Waaw (و) makes the [w] sound, like the first sound in &quot;week&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Smalltalk is a fully object oriented language. 

The most important and consistent ideas in the language are that:
 (1) there are objects
 (2) send messages to objects 
 (3) get back an object as the result.

So 2 + 3 is considered as &quot;sending a message + to object 2, with argument 3 and the result of the message is another object 5&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigation|Book=Blended Learning in K-12
|current=Why is Blended Learning Important?
|previous=The many names of Blended Learning
|next=Evolution of Blended Learning}}

Now that you know what blended learning is, you may be asking yourself, &quot;Why do I need to know about blended learning? Why is it important?&quot; Over the years, many groups of people have asked this same question. These groups have included classroom teachers and others in the field of education, but have also included people in the business field as well. Blended learning makes up the “fastest growing use of technologies in learning—much faster then the development of online courses.” (Alvarez, 2005) Because of the interest in blended learning, there have been many research studies done to find the potential strengths and weaknesses of blended learning as compared to just the traditional classroom or e-learning.

== In Education ==

Educators seem to have the most interest in blended learning, for obvious reasons.  Because of this, much of the research on blended learning has been based around classroom situations.  All levels of education have been researched with blended learning, from the elementary school grades up to graduate school.  Educators’ interests in blended learning is best summarized by Flavin in his E-Learning Advantages in a Tough Economy. He states:

Ironically, the notion of blending is nothing new.  Good classroom teachers have always blended their methods—reading, writing, lecture, discussion, practice and projects, to name just a few, are all part of an effective blend.  Blending is only a revelation for those who have been trying to do everything with just one tool—usually the computer—and ending up with less than ideal results.  Understanding that using the right tool, in the right situation, for the right purpose should be a guiding design principle. (Flavin, 2001)

One clear advantage of blended learning in education is its connection with differentiated instruction.  Differentiated instruction involves “custom-designing instruction based on student needs.” (deGula, 2004)  In differentiated instruction, educators look at students’ learning styles, interests, and abilities.  Once these factors have been determined, educators decide which curriculum content, learning activities, products, and learning environments will best serve those individual students’ needs.  Blended learning can fit into a number of these areas.  By using blended learning, educators are definitely altering the learning environment when students work collaboratively in learning communities online, for example.  Teachers could also add relevant curriculum content that would be unavailable or difficult to comprehend outside of the internet.  Learning activities and products can also be changed to use technologies in a classroom that uses blended learning.

So what does the research say?  In a study by Dean and associates, research showed that providing several online options in addition to traditional classroom training actually increased what students learned. (2001) Another study showed that student interaction and satisfaction improved, along with students learning more, in courses that incorporated blended learning. (DeLacey and Leonard, 2002) 

Another advantage of blended learning is pacing and attendance.  In most blended learning classrooms, there is the ability to study whenever the student chooses to do so.  If a student is absent, she/he may view some of the missed materials at the same time that the rest of the class does, even though the student cannot be physically in the classroom. This helps students stay on track and not fall behind, which is especially helpful for students with prolonged sicknesses or injuries that prevent them from attending school. These “self-study modules” also allow learners to review certain content at any time for help in understanding a concept or to work ahead for those students who learn at a faster pace. (Alvarez, 2005) 
    
Because of the ability of students to self-pace, there is a higher completion rate for students in blended learning classrooms than to those in strictly e-learning situations. (Flavin, 2001) This self-pacing allows for the engagement of every learner in the classroom at any given time. Students also see that the learning involved becomes a process, not individual learning events.  This revelation allows for an increased application of the learning done in the classroom. (Flavin, 2001)

With the given research, it is clear that using blended learning in education improves the teaching and learning done in a given course.  Educators want to teach in a way that best reaches all of their students.  If blended learning accomplishes this, then more teachers will begin to use these methods.  When teachers begin to explore blended learning and the resources that can be found through the internet and other technologies, they can structure their classroom in a way that best suits their teaching style and their students’ learning styles.  Blended learning allows “[teachers] and [their] students to have the best of both worlds.” (Alvarez, 2005)  The traditional classroom and e-learning both have advantages and disadvantages.  As Alvarez states, “the online environment is not the ideal setting for all types of learning.  Classrooms are not perfect either…. That’s why so many teachers and corporate trainers are concentrating their efforts on integrating internet-based technologies and classrooms to create blended learning environments.  It just makes good sense.” (2005)

As stated above blended learning should provide students and teachers with the best of both worlds. I Agree that this should happen, but I am not convinced that this does happen. Teachers that have been teaching for numerous years may be stuck in their traditional teaching methods. These same teachers may not be technology literate which in turn limits what they can do with technology. Teachers must be trained and required to use some type of technology in the classroom if blended learning is going to successfully take place. The teachers may use a variety of teaching styles, but without technology the students are being cheated out of what they need to be successful in today's world. Proper teacher training is the only way teachers and students will &quot;get the best of both worlds.&quot;  Bret M. Helms

== In Business ==

Blended learning is also of interest to corporate world.  Through different studies, blended learning has been shown to be an effective tool in worker training and education.  One of the best advantages of blended learning for the business world is its cost-effectiveness.  When a business relies purely on instructor-led training, besides paying the cost of the trainer, there are also transportation, hotel, food, and other expenses.  Blended learning helps reduce these expenditures by reducing the amount of time needed to face-to-face instruction. (Alvarez, 2005)  “Effective blending lets an organization spend the dollars in the most beneficial, cost effective way.” (Flavin, 2001)  A business can decide what mix of face-to-face and e-learning would best fit their learning objectives.

One study which illustrates some of the benefits of blended learning in today’s business world is the Thomson Job Impact Study. (2003)  This study had 128 participants from a number of corporate and academic organizations, including Lockheed-Martin, Utah State University, National Cash Register, and the University of Limerick in Limerick, Ireland. The researchers wanted to determine if blended learning increased the overall learning in a number of areas.  What they found supports the use of blended learning in the corporate world.  The blended learning group “significantly” out-performed the traditional and e-learning group in spreadsheet application performance and they took less time to complete the real-world tasks than did the e-learning group.  Overall, the blended learning classroom achieved a performance improvement of 30 percent. (Thomson, 2003).  Given these apparent benefits, it is only natural that the business world is now also incorporating blended learning techniques into their employee training and education programs.  By doing a quick internet search, a business could find a number of manuals and examples of how to incorporate blended learning strategies into their own programs.  There are also companies which specialize in bringing blended learning programs into the business world.

As one can see, the benefits of using blended learning have been carefully researched.  Most people would agree that these benefits support the use of blended learning in the classroom and in the business realm as well.  It is up to the individual educator or business how best to use the tools of blended learning to meet their own goals and those of their students/workers. really</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== EE ==

I doubt that you want to mix your work with your time on wikibooks, but I've created a number of books in the Electrical Engineering bookshelf that you might be able to lend a helping hand with. If not, I understand (you don't want to come home after a long day of engineering, to write about engineering on wikibooks). 

On a personal note, i'm a young EE that recently graduated. Where do you work? What do you do? I just started grad school myself, so i'm out of the job market for a few years anyway, but it never hurts to learn about opportunities. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:36, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

:It doesn't really matter where you reply to these comments, i'll see them no matter where you are. Don't feel obligated to help out the EE bookshelf, i just like to inform knowledgable contributors that the bookshelf has expanded greatly in the past few months, and that there are plenty of opportunities to help out. I recently started a [[Digital Signal Processing]] book, and there is also an [[Embedded Systems]] one if you want to write more about software. Talk to you later. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:35, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

== Category ==

I'm currently trying to categorise each module in Wikibooks. The idea is to make it possible for anyone to find a module they are looking for in Wikibooks through the category system. Also, as &quot;module&quot; for the module count means any page that isn't very short that has some kind of link in it, this also means that I am added modules without links to the module count too. This sounds trivial, but is important as wikis get measured by the number of &quot;good articles&quot;.

Most books easily fall within certain categories. Your book, however, doesn't appear to me to do so (although lobbing it into &quot;candidates for book of the month&quot; might be an idea:) ). I've therefore just added the same category to each page. If you could continue to do the same for new pages, it would be appreciated. Alternatively, if you have a good way of categorising that pages, please implement that.

And by the way, keep up the good work, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:07, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

:I second that... great book!
:I'm sort of following behind Jguk and doing more detailed categorisation. I'll probably add a lot of subject-area tags to individual pages, assumming that's OK with you :).  --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:40, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

::Actually, I was going to put them in general topic categories, not specific to the book. I mostly work on the how-tos category, and a lot of the pages of the AY book are excellent how-tos (better than most, in fact). Since there can be more than one how-to on any particular subject (more than one way to skin a cat, so to speak), I think it will be nice to be able to follow category paths, even if only for finding &quot;see also&quot; links. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:52, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

== Music honour ==

- FYI - I have previously completed a music workbook for this honour, so I have got all the illustratrations of scales, cleffs, etc drawn, I am just uploading and editing as I have time. - Gerald G.

== Adventist reverts ==
Hi - I notice you are reverting these now.  I did do a few earlier on and placed a question on the IP talk page concerned (got nothing back!).  The edits ''starting'' looking more authentic so I was unsure about reverting any more.  I'll keep an eye and know for the future.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:59, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

==Thanks for your help==
Hi, I just now saw your messages to me, and I'm not sure I've figured out much of the wiki stuff, but as you have modified equations and added formatting info, I've learned by looking at what you are doing.

I've been having a hard time staying focused on one topic, so I've been bouncing around. Yes, I'm interested in the knot tying, as well as looking at the stars and advanced stars, so as I get better at wiki editing, you may see me touch more areas.

==Spiders==
Hi Jim,
Thanks for the help and encouragement.I am so new that I don't know how all this works. How and where am I to respond when someone puts something in &quot;My Talk&quot;? Also, I haven't figured out how to add pictures. I'd like to add pictures of spiders form the reference in #1 that requires the drawing of the spiders. I placed the website link to the pictures in that requirement. Can you either tell me how to add pictures or will you add them?

Thanks for all you do. --[[User:Stephanieeast|Stephanieeast]] 03:03, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

==Apologies==
I took out the template marks as I understand &quot;templates&quot; to be quite different to chapters in the book (they certainly are in the rest of Wikibooks). --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:14, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
This might be useful to you [[Help:A quick guide to templates]] as the {{ brackets are for templates --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:31, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
::Hi Jim
::Maybe it's me but I guess I took templates to be largely about organising the way a part or part page looks throughout a book.  However I fully accept that if you plan using the same text in several places your approach may well be the best one and sorry for the removal (I'll still keep an eye for vandals - watching gives you a flavour for what is going on).  The &quot;popups&quot; bit is some java script that makes checking changes and reverting them rather easier.

== Me again ==
Hi Jim , just browsing (as I do) I see that you are adding the category to each page.  Of course this means that all pages get categorised under &quot;A&quot; for Adventist.  Not an issue to me but it depends on how you think/want people to look at the category.  If you place &lt;nowiki&gt;|{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; after the current text and before the final ]] brackets you may prefer the way the category sorts the page?  I've just done [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Sand]] to show you how it looks - in the category in nows shows as N for Nature.  Let me know if I can help - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:58, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

== Page Edit Bot ==

Hey Jim! Haven't spoken to you in a while. I saw all your efforts to categorize the pages in your book. I just wanted to let you know that I have created a bot that can make edits to multiple pages at once. My bot can do things like add category links to all the pages in a book, for instance. If you have any other changes that you would like to make to multiple pages at once, let me know, and I can save you alot of effort! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:24, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

:If you are interested in my bot, and if you know perl, you might be interested in reading some of the documentation I have written about it at [[User:Whiteknight/Bot]]. My bot is written in 100% perl. I wrote a module that uses LWP to submit edits, and then I have been using TK to write GUIs for my library, so that I can make edits to multiple pages at once (with a foreach loop). I can send you some of the source code if you want. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 05:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== Bots, edits &amp; welcomes ==

Hi Jim.  Looking at the post to WK on bot type stuff do let me know if I can help, it's quite a powerful piece of software that I have not explored all corners of yet but it can do a lot of editing to pages on a semi automatic basis.  Once I've setup the &quot;run&quot; to cat your pages it can easily be run again - it will ignore pages that do not need editing.  In passing I noticed that you &quot;welcome&quot; your contributors which is great - would it be wise to incorporate some of the conventional &quot;welcome&quot; template so that they have some hints about help, polices and the like? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:18, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
:No idea Jim - I just use it!  But if you want more info [[w:WP:AWB]] is the place I got it (I picked it up when I was more regular on Wikipedia).  As you'll see the features are quite extensive and I've enabled the spell checking on here tho I did notice yesterday it slipped up on a couple of words so I must see if there is an update.

:Thinking it thro Jim - there is another approach to this.  I declined admin earlier on but a run in with someone similar changed my mind - I was frustrated that such a mindless idiot could get away with that kind of behaviour. I would have no problem at all nominating you for adminship.  You are a strong, conscientious and thoughtful editor.  However from your point of view I guess there is a sort of obligation to help on a project wide basis if only to a limited degree.  I can tell you from three days experience it is quite scary but if you are interested you know where I am and &quot;no thanks&quot; will not mean I won't do what I can to help you!  I suggest that you &quot;reflect&quot; rather than &quot;react&quot; but do think about it.

::Jim - I'll get back to you as soon as i can on FF stuff, if you like I'll &quot;load&quot; your monobook.js with some bits - clear the cache and voila - play around, the worst that happens is you blank it if you don't like it.

==Requirements Outlined==
Hi Jim. The requirements are outlined for all the honors that have the requirements available. Now it should be easier for others to fill in the answers. I hope the formatting and header info are correct. Rodney and I have done some of this work late at night. Let me know if you find things I need to fix.
Thanks for all your hard work and commitment.

== Templates and other included content ==

I noticed you put some sections in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Music]] into templates. I just wanted to alert you to an alternative which is to include normal pages. Any page can be included by typing
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Name of page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Templates are a specialized type of shared content, intended for very frequently used notation, formatting, labelling, notification, etc. and therefore have a seperate namespace. The template-namespace means that they will not be searched by default while included normal pages would. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

: &lt;small&gt;''The following comment moved here from [[User talk:Swift#Template (mis)use]]''--[[User:Swift|Swift]] 15:37, 7 December 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
:Hi Swift,

:I didn't know I there was a better way to include content on multiple pages other than with templates.  Thanks for the tip.  I thought I had seen something on doing that a long time ago, but when I needed it, I couldn't find the info on how to do it.  And I ''did'' do a pretty thorough search! I finally mistakenly concluded that I must have been thinking about templates, so I went with that.  I have probably fifty such templates that I used for first aid and camping too.  Luckily, I prefixed them all with &quot;Ay&quot; when I created them, so maybe that will make them easier for me to find (though some of them should remain templates as they take arguments and are used throughout my book).  I think what you are suggesting is that I should make them &quot;regular&quot; pages, and then include them in all the place they are used.  Thanks again. [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 14:29, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

:: You're welcome. Yes, this is precisely what I was suggesting. Regarding finding the pages, you can use the special page [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:Ay]]. Regarding resources on MediaWiki syntax, you might want to keep an eye on http://www.mediawiki.org/ where they are slowly buidling &amp;mdash; among other things &amp;mdash; a user manual/handbook. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 15:37, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

::: Hi Swift.  Is there a way to figure out what modules include a template?  As it turns out &quot;fifty&quot; was off by at least a factor of two &amp;mdash; perhaps three.  I have about fifty [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:First aid|First aid]] templates, and I have used them in a ''lot'' of places &amp;mdash; not only in the First Aid honors, but in some of the recreation ones as well (e.g. [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Winter Camping|Winter Camping]] requires knowledge for treating hypothermia and frostbite).  I also found a bunch of [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:Knot|Knot]] templates that are used all over the place.  If I have to search for them manually, it's going to take a lot of digging.

:::: &quot;''Is there a way to figure out what modules include a template?''&quot; Yes, you can use the &quot;What links here&quot; tool in the toolbox just below the search box in the side-bar (e.g. [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Adventist_Youth_Honors_Answer_Book/Camping/Choosing_a_campsite]]). Included pages will have a &quot;(inclusion)&quot; behind the page link (just as redirects have &quot;(redirect)&quot;).
:::: Is this what you were looking for? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:41, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: Yes, that's it.  I hadn't noticed the &quot;What links here&quot; link under the search box, but I did find the same thing when I was moving my templates - the request to check for double redirects does the same thing.  Anyhow, I have made a lot of progress moving the templates to regular pages now.  There's still a lot of work to do though.  Thanks again for the tip.

:::::: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:42, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

== Work to do! ==

Jim - Consider the cat run done - later today hopefully - it really is easier than individually editing everything.  Back to FF do you use the default monobook? If so I will happily edit your .js or point you to the WP pages where I found stuff.

Community wide thoughts - if you are interested I think I would probably recommend looking at the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] and it's discussions as well as [[WB:VFD|Votes for deletion]] and probably [[WB:RFA|Request for Admin]] to get a flavour of what is around.  If you feel like it contribute and folks will get to know you a little too.

== Dealing with vandalism ==

Hi Jim - sorry to trouble you but I do know that this is something that concerns you too.  Could I ask you to look at [[WB:RFA]] in the checkuser sections.  This additional tool allows vandal fighters to discover what IP address was used by a named vandal and allow people to block that address to prevent creation of further accounts.  There is a requirement for 25 votes to obtain these rights which on a small wiki is not easy.  I stress I am not asking you to vote or to vote for a particular person but if you, and any registered contributor to your project, could look at this it may be helpful for the Wikibooks in the future.  I hope you don't object to my approach.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:16, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
:My thanks - &amp; if I can help you, you do know that I will --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:45, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

== Checkuser ==

Hi Jim - I was hoping that someone who was one would get back to you on this so may not be fully correct or complete.  The right allows someone to look into the &quot;login&quot; data past the user name.  It allows viewing of the IP address which a named user logs in from.  That way if we have a vandal with a name at present I can block the name permanently but I can only block the IP address for a short period &amp; I will not be able to see the actual address.  With checkuser rights I would see that IP address and be able to look at any other activity from that IP address.  That way if there is a history of vandalism from that source I should be able to deal with the problem on a more permanent basis.

The checks that are now being requested when someone wants any additional rights on the RfA page are something that [[User:SB_Johnny]] and I both see as desirable.  If you are seeking the trust of the community someone should take a look behind the name as it were to see if there is any history of problems with the IP address (something I think has been an issue on Wikipedia and less likely to be one here but I see it as a valid sign of trust).  I hope this helps and thanks again for your support - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:46, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

== Honor requirement Discussion ==

Hi Jim- As I have looked at a number of the honors, I've been concerned with how poorly written some are. Would the discussion section of a particular honor be a good place to entertain a discussion of the honor requirements themselves and possibly generate enough feedback to get some of these things changed?

I was working with my nephew over the Christmas holiday, on the Fishes honor. 10 families of fishes does not express the amount of variety that exist. For example does the fishes honor include the three classes of fish that currently exist. I was not sure from the wording if lamprey, or sharks are even a part of the honor. I personally think it would be good to talk about the 3 classes and then go down the taxonomic tree describing phylum or families, but to jump directly to families of fish denies much of the diversity.

When working on the Physics honor I was concerned with how little of physics was actually covered, You would not know that lighit, waves, quontum mechanics, thermodynamics or a number of other areas of physics were even part of the honor. In this case, I'd recomend some rewriting of the requirements, but also the writing of an advanced honor.

My question is should we have a special area to discuss possible changes to the honor. (To put this in context, ever year my area Coordinator asks for editorial changes for the honors, but it is always at the last minute, and I don't have notes of the problems just lying around- I'm looking for a repository for discussion of problems or improvements), And should this discussion area include the possibility of an Advanced honor? 

or

Should we leave the normal Discussion section for this type of endevor?

Good ones for you and those you care about for 2007 - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:37, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

==SVG files not supported?==
Many of the wikipedia image files for optics are vector based files .svg  

I have not been able to use the files. Am I doing something wrong or to wikibooks not support .svg?

Thanks

==Picture Issues==
Hi Jim,
Please look at the Mammal honor. I had some trouble with some of the pictures. If you could let me know what I did wrong I'd appreciate it.
--[[User:Stephanieeast|Stephanieeast]] 06:57, 6 January 2007 (UTC)


Hi Jim, I tried to follow your directions and I couldn't get it to work.  I was able to copy the metadata and paste it in, but when I pasted the name into the Source File Name I got this error message, &quot;The file you uploaded seems to be empty. This might be due to a typo in the file name. Please check whether you really want to upload this file.&quot; I copied the file name and pasted it in.
What next?
--[[User:Stephanieeast|Stephanieeast]] 00:30, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

Thanks Jim, for the clarification. I will use the steps next time. Thank you for fixing the pictures this time:)

== New rights ==
Jim - by way of thanks for the support and information.  There was a vandal up to the usual on the 3rd, had you been around you would have seen him and had I been around I would have blocked him but no other information would have been available.  Now I can tell you that the same IP address had been used quite recently for the same type of vandalism and equally that IP address has not been used recently for legitimate editing.  As a result I was able to block the IP address for a while at least which will give us some peace from that particular one for a while.  Thanks again for the support, regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)


== Optics images and Some General ideas ==

Jim, I had thought the same thing about the optics images. I think I'd like to see them as separate images even so there is more flexibility for whoever wants to use them.

I'm planning on doing the slide projector and telescope to match the quality of some of the images (Like casagrain, or coude telescopes) 

Stephanie and I have been working on the mammals honor recently. We decided to do one together. As I was working on it I started thinking about two somewhat related issues and how to best deal with them.
:::1) Units- It seems to be common practice on wikipedia to have metric units followed by English units. I find this irritating. I think one of the main reasons that we still use English units in the United states is that all math courses are taught with conversions from one unit to another. This translates to &quot;difficult&quot; in peoples brains.

In the wiki format we have the ability to give just the metric unit, but if the person wants to convert they can click on the number and use the Google conversion capability to do the conversion for them. I have done this in the mammal honor, and would like to possibly make this a standard for the AY honor books.

:::2) Scientific names- I have noticed that it is common practice to have the common name and then in parenthesis the scientific name. I think the scientific name is more useful, and what people do with things in parenthesis is ignore them.

In similar reasoning to the above, I'd like to try reversing this and have the scientific name and then in parenthesis the common name.

What do you think about these two issues

--[[User:Rodneyeast|Rodney]] 14:46, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

== Thanks (I think) ==

You realize of course that this just means more work :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:12, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

== Metric Units ==

I've written up some Javascript that should make the conversion between metric and english units very easy. I left a large note about it in the staff lounge. If you would like to test this script, let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:14, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
:Ah... the sweet smell of progress!  I slapped the template in my [[User:Jomegat|user page]], and it does indeed give me Kg - but I don't see the &quot;convert units&quot; link in the toolbox.  Do I hafta to do something else to make that happen?  Also, the links in the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] are red, leading me to Template:User:Whiteknight/Convtest.  I took out the &quot;template&quot; and was able to find it OK, but you might wanna fix it in the SL. [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 03:33, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
::Good call on the templates, i did indeed get the links incorrect. I will fix that ASAP. As to the link, you actually need to monkey around with your personal javascript. Go to [[User:Jomegat/monobook.js]], and include the following line:
 document.write('&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;' 
             + 'http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Whiteknight/convert.js' 
             + '&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript&amp;dontcountme=s&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;');
Once you include this in your javascript, save it, and then use Ctrl+F5 to refresh the page with the templates. That should popup the link. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:44, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:::That works pretty well.  Thanks.  I may grab a copy and play with it myself a little.  Maybe it's time I learned Javascript. Is there any chance that once this evolves a bit more it'll be installed site-wide?  I think the people who would benefit most from this are prolly not going to go through the trouble of editing a monobook.js file.  [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 06:10, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

== Hi, and thanks for the welcome ==
My real name is Joe Lee and I don't mind if you use it in the info box. I don't know how much I'll be able to help with the answer book, it will probably be fairly sporadic.

== Remaining Adventist Youth templates ==

Jomegat, I came across many [[Special:Unusedtemplates|unused templates]] (or you may view them at [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:Ay|here]]) associated with the Adventist Youth wikibook. They are all the redirects from when you moved them into main-namespace modules. If they are unnecessary, and while I don't expect you to tag them all, may I kindly ask that you request at WB:AN that they be deleted?

Also, would you be interested in Template:Ay music clefs? It looks like a module, but it has not been redirected. Thank you, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for the heads up.  I left a message at WB:AN as requested.  I'll hafta look into the music clefs page.  I moved it to a place where I'll be able to find it later, so the template can go (it didn't belong there). [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 01:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

::Thank you. BTW, The Adventist Youth Wikibook is very well done. It has many illustrations and is rather complete. Keep up the good work. :) --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 02:01, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Thanks for the compliment.  I have thoroughly enjoyed my work on it (why else would ''anyone'' work on one anyhow?) [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 02:11, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

=== Cont'd ===

I know at [[WB:AN]] you mentioned that there exist other template redirects, and that you weren't &quot;quite ready for them to go the way of the dodo yet.&quot; When you are, would mind taking a look at [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:Ay]] and [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:First aid]]. And, if you don't want them deleted yet, please just say, &quot;Stop!&quot; and I'll stop. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:31, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

:The First Aid ones and the Ay ones (other than the three I mentioned) are ready to go.  I have ''other'' templates elsewhere that I still need to clean up.  I'll let you know when they're ready.

::Ack, I'm sorry. I overlooked that I'd already asked about the Ay templates. Sorry. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:49, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

:::No need to apologize.  And let's make sure that this tedious task you've undertaken is not a thankless one too: THANK YOU!  -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 04:52, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

I made a massive table / list of the links (with delete links) at [[User:Iamunknown/Speedy]]. I removed the three Ay templates that are not redirects / are being used. I hope it is okay. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 05:13, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

== Links... ==

We need a better help page on how to do chapter linking, but here's the basics:

*To link to a subpage of the page you're working on, use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/SUBPAGENAME/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*To link from one subpage to another, use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../SUBPAGENAME/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*If you're not using a &quot;flat structure&quot; (i.e., if your chapters have subchapters), it gets more complicated... that's why flat structures are generally preferred (Book/Chapter rather than Book/Chapter/Subchapter). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:40, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

== [[Template%3ABird_id]] ==

Hi!  FYI with a thought. This template caught [[M:MP:TSP|my eye]] as being of possible interest on Wikispecies, so I added some [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ABird_id&amp;diff=794000&amp;oldid=782066 usage]. What would you think of fixing it up to take another two images, but to auto-scale the images to about 1/3rd width... if there are three (keeping this size if less) then someone could put up six panes or three and have a tighter presentation. If interested, let me know, I can probably do that fairly easily. Best regards. // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 14:14, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
: Hi Frank!  Yes - PLEASE make those changes.  I had asked for something very similar in the [[WB:SLT|Wikibooks technical chat room]].  It is well beyond my current capabilities to do just as you have suggested.  Originally the images were named image_male, image_female, and image_juvenile, but then I started coming across photos of a male and a female together. So I decided to make them generic.  Do you think the range map should retain its name or should it be generic too?  I have used this template in few enough areas that I'm not concerned about backwards compatibility.  Another thought would be to have the description field take the place of an image if only one image were specified. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas (aka Jomegat)]] 14:31, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

Hi Jim - just looking at logs I noticed you blocked a vandal for a month.  Looking at the user page on wp ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tooj117]) I've changed the blo9ck to indef.  Equally the IP shows a previous vandal on there recently so I will block that for a while shortly.  Hope you don't mind and that all is well.

*reset
Well we both learnt something there - I think I was aware I'd seen something, just didn't expect it under the &quot;test&quot; section.  I also recall seeing Whiteknight's argument before too.  In practice most of the vandals we get have quite long histories on wikipedia (worth checking the page there when blocking) so are well aware of how to find when blocks expire.

To me the more important thing is to make it clear we do not have a &quot;vandalize anything you like but stop at the fourth warning or we will block you&quot; policy of Wikipedia.  So - depending on the extent and nature of the vandalism I will block immediately or certainly after one warning (they do know what they are doing after all).  Equally if there is a history on WP I will refer to that (&amp; so would not use a standard template) and will often block for quite a long time of what is a &quot;first offense&quot; here.  I ran this past Derbeth sometime ago and he also takes records on other Wikis into account (I often check Commons too as I spend some time there as well).  This, to me, sends a message that we are less tolerant of bad behavior on Books which seems correct.

I hope you dont mind, but i blocked this ip for 1 day after your warning. When people make very profane vandalism, i dont see a reason to give them a second chance. &quot;Suck my ****&quot; is just not acceptable, and i dont think we should be dealing with that stuff.

I did hesitate to nominate it for the very reason it has one opposing vote.  I have not said anything to my other contributors (they don't come around too often, and they surely don't watch the nominations page) because like me, they would be biased, and I was looking for unbiased opinions. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:39, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

::Everybody has a different personal policy involving blocks. I tend not to give warnings, although i know many other admins who do.

That's just me though, everybody has their own way and you need to figure out what you are most comfortable with.

::: The funny thing is that I started this book because, although there are ''official'' resources, they only cover four of the nine categories.  People were always asking about the ones that did not exist on the forums, and someone asked again just after I stumbled across Wikibooks.  Thus, the project was born.  The original scope of the project was to write answers for the honor that had none - those millions nobody ever earns.  Other people encouraged me to make room for all of them, and I'm glad I listened.  One of them runs the outfit that sells the official books.  The book has an international following now, and I have heard from a lot of people for whom it is the ''only'' resource available (the official books are not cheap).  At first I just concentrated on the honors that had no answers, but after about a year of that, I was getting tapped out on expertise.  So I have now turned my attention to writing up the honors that do have official answers. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:54, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

== IP blocking... ==

Hi Jim. Just to be safe, it's generally better to block problem IPs for a year (or shorter), rather than indefinite, since IP addresses can be transferred over time. Also, for IPs adding serial spam like that, I generally unselect &quot;anonymous users only&quot;, because otherwise accounts can still edit using the IP (sort of helps to have checkuser to be safe there, but if some unintentional collateral blocking happens, they can use the {{tl|unblock}} template and get our attention). --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:17, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

== Non-fiction versus textbooks ==

G'day Jomegat, please read the recent change made to [[WB:WIW]] in context. Before the anon edit, it said that &quot;''As a general rule, most non-fiction books are not suitable for inclusion as they are not instructional.''&quot; This is correct; whilst textbooks are (generally) non-fiction, not all non-fiction books are textbooks. For example, travel guides, dictionaries and encyclopaedia are usually non-fiction but are not suitable for Wikibooks as they are non textbooks. The next sentence says that &quot;''Fiction is not allowed on Wikibooks, although the use of allegory or fables as instructional tools can be permitted in some situations.''&quot; This covers the situation that I believe the anon editor was aiming for. 

Please revert your edit if you agree, or reply below (your talk page, not mine) and we can continue this discussion further. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:25, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

: Hi Webaware.  As you can see, I saw the brilliance of your logic and have reverted the edit. Thanks for pointing it out, and sorry for the confusion. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:21, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

::No worries, it was an easy mistake to make. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:25, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

== [[:Image:Boneset.jpg|Boneset]]! ==

Hey Jim! So nice to see a photo of that up now... someone had actually added an image of a different plant on the wikipedia page, which I had removed a few days ago. I used that image on [[v:BCP/Eupatorium perfoliatum|this page on Wikiversity]], and had a thought that you and the Youth Honors folks might be interested in participating on the bloom clock in general. It's a research project aimed in part at defining a global language for discussing bloom times, but also for creating illustrated keys by region and month (see [[v:Bloom Clock/White flowers seen in July in Southeastern Pennsylvania]]... the boneset picture actually appears on that page too now). Log entries from NH would be very nice (for me), since I go up there a couple times per year to visit my father-in-law on his farm near Charlestown.  There's [[v:Bloom_Clock/The_10_plants_per_month_pledge|one other page]] I worked on recently that might provide some ideas as well for how to contribute. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:00, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

: I didn't know about the bloom clock project, but yes, I am very interested in participating.  I have been involved in a similar project related to reptiles and amphibians http://www.wildlife.state.nh.us/Wildlife/Nongame/reptiles_amphibians.htm - only the NH Fish and Game department's implementation is a little clunky.  This looks to be a better setup for the same sort of data.  As for involving other people involved in Pathfinders, I will mention it to the ones I know and post a message on our forum.  NHF&amp;G asks for (but does not demand) a photo of every sighting - I wonder if that would be a good idea for the bloom clock.  It would help weed out false data and perhaps bump up the number of photo contributions.
::False data could concievably be a problem, but I really sort of doubt it. My &quot;plan&quot; is to just ignore people who are adding things that look a bit funny, then just delete their logs a year or so after they get bored of playing silly. Eventually I'd like this to be peer-reviewed and come up with a global language of bloom time, but I'm thinking we'll need at least 10 years of data before we can get there, so there's plenty of time to set that up. Also, I'd rather people ''not'' upload image files unless they're an improvement over files already available on commons (fuzzy cell-phone-camera photos are better than no photos at all, but if there are already good ones, let's just stay conservative with the disk space). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:44, 29 July 2007 (UTC)
:The plant I uploaded last night is growing next to the kid's swing set in an un-mown section of my backyard.  There's also some Whorled Loosestrife out there and some Wild Sarsaparilla.  The Loosestrife is done blooming now for the most part - it's very difficult to find blossoms anymore - but I uploaded a pic of the sarsaparilla.  I have several more shots of some unknowns.  A personal goal I set for myself is to id every plant growing on my two acres of New Hampshire.  I am far from reaching that goal, but Boneset, Loosestrife, and Wild Sarsaparilla are plants that were previously unknown to me.  I've also got a plant in bloom right now and can't decide if it's catnip or downy wood mint.  I'll upload it to the unknown section as soon as I get a chance.
: Incidentally, I have had an REM song stuck in my head for the past several days because I ''perceive'' that it contains the word &quot;boneset&quot;.  Dunno if it really does, and I don't even know the name of the song. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 13:47, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

:::Oh man... just lovin you right now :). I'd definitely '''&quot;Support&quot;''' a reptile clock as well... actually my first outreach project for Wikimedia Pennsylvania will be with a group that wants to start a butterfly clock/key using the same methods as the bloom clock. Given several years of contributions, these &quot;distributed research&quot; projects could really help us understand natural relationships in time and space (i.e., when Plant X is flowering, it's time to start looking for Turtle Y or Butterfly Z). Fun stuff... it took me almost a year to figure out the templating and logistical problems, but the Bloom Clock's structure should be easily adaptable to similar things. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:38, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

:::: Turns out the REM song is ''Swan, Swan, H'', and the lyric is 
:::::''Hey captain don't you want to buy&lt;br&gt;Some bone chains and toothpicks?''
::::But &quot;bone chains&quot; is close enough to &quot;boneset&quot; to get it stuck in my head. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:13, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

:: My unknown was the first one on the list of unknowns!  But I'm not sure it's really ''Prunella vulgaris'' - note that your specimen (and mine) has an entire edge, but the one on Wikipedia has a serrated edge.  Actually, all my books indicate that catnip should have a serrated edge too, and that's what has been holding me back on calling it that.  I had just about settled in my mind that I was looking at downy wood mint. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 14:04, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

::Nevermind.  Maybe it is ''Prunella vulgaris''.   went outside and found two specimens side-by-side - one with an entire, and another with a serrated margin. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 15:36, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

:::Heh, I've been keying that last couple days, and yes, Franz is right (he's a botanist, and a German to boot (so really likes to be precise :_))). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:38, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Section 2.1 - Proofs==
'''Proofs''' are set up to let the user understand what steps were taken in order to receive a given output. There are three types of proofs depending on which is easiest to the student.
===Two-Column Proofs===
Two-column proofs (also known as formal proofs) are set up in a two-value table, one being &quot;Statement&quot; and the other being &quot;Reason&quot;.  To prove a simple problem using this method, set up a table like the following:

{| Style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot; rules=&quot;none&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f0f0&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px;&quot;|Statement
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f0f0&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px;&quot;| Reason 
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
|}

Be sure to leave room for values to go in both columns. In geometry, the first row is the 'given' of the problem. This is the information that is given about a certain problem without using a picture. The last row should be the conclusion of what you are trying to prove.
====Example of a Two-Column Proof====
Now, suppose a problem tells you to solve &lt;math&gt;x + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, showing all steps made to get to the answer.  A proof shows how this is done:

{| Style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot; rules=&quot;none&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f0f0&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px;&quot;|Statement
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f0f0&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px;&quot;| Reason 
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;x + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|Given
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|Property of subtraction
|}

We use &quot;Given&quot; as the first reason, because it is &quot;given&quot; to us in the problem.

===Written Proof===
Written proofs (also known as informal proofs, paragraph proofs, or 'plans for proof') are written in paragraph form. Other than this formatting difference, they are similar to two-column proofs.

Sometimes it is helpful to start with a written proof, before formalizing the proof in two-column form.  If you're having trouble putting your proof into two column form, try &quot;talking it out&quot; in a written proof first.
====Example of a Written Proof====

We are given that x + 1 = 2, so if we subtract one from each side of the equation (x + 1 - 1 = 2 - 1), then we can see that x = 1 by the definition of subtraction.

===Flowchart Proof===
A flowchart proof or more simply a flow proof is a graphical representation of a two-column proof.  Each set of statement and reasons are recorded in a box and then arrows are drawn from one step to another.  This method shows how different ideas come together to formulate the proof.

==Section 2.2 - Reasons ==
Every concept in geometry flows in a logical progression.  One simply cannot go from A to B without explaining how and/or why.  For instance, the following is not a proof: 

5(x+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-x

x=4

Also, we cannot make up reasons why we made the next step so.  Therefore, we can only use certain information as our reasons.  These include:

'''1. Given:''' This is generally either the problem (equation) we are trying to solve, or some piece of important information given in the problem.  

'''2. Properties:''' These for the most part are the basic mathematical functions of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, such as the second reason in the example above (Property of Subtraction).

'''3. Definitions:''' Again, saying &quot;Because it is&quot; is not a reason.  This sort of reasoning is not seen as often as other reasons.  By using definitions, sometimes the answer or part of the working of a proof can be shortened.  For example, by using the reason &quot;definition of a bisector&quot; (and being ALREADY able to prove through either given information or earlier parts of the proof), you can prove that that two adjoining angles are congruent without having to go through a more lengthy proof.

'''4. Postulates:''' Postulates hold the same value as theorems (explained next), except that they cannot be proven.  However, these generalized rules have proven correct for a very long time and can be accepted with proof of their validity.  An example is &quot;Through any two points there is exactly one line&quot;.  While it cannot be proven through a proof (although the authors dare anyone to disprove it), it is accepted as a reason.  There are few of these, so as good as it may sound, if you make it up, someone will notice.

'''5. Theorems:''' Theorems are statements that have been proven true through proofs of their own.  They are especially helpful shortcuts in their own right as by stating a theorem, a great many things are proven and you do not have to do all the work of re-proving the theorem.  Theorems can be simple (&quot;If two lines intersect, then they intersect in exactly one point.&quot;) or very complex (&quot;The composite of two isometries is an isometry.&quot; [Don't panic if you don't understand; it will be explained later on]).  Sometimes, you will be given the proofs for theorems; othertimes, as part of the exercises, you will be asked to prove it yourself.

'''6. Axioms:''' For most purposes, the same as Postulates.  The difference is that Axioms are algebraic in nature, while Postulates come mainly from geometry.

'''7. Corollaries:''' These are statements that stem from what becomes proven in theorems and definitions and do not require (though usually have) separate proofs themselves.  

In many textbooks, the proofs are numbered for an index at the back of the book.  When doing correct geometric proofs, it is NOT OK to write down &quot;Theorem 15&quot;.  Write out the statement exactly as it was given to you (yes, you have to do some memorization for geometry). You have to make sure that the information in the box is related to the earlier box.

==Section 2.3 - Using Proofs in Geometry==
===Exercises===

Answers to each exercise can be found separately in the Appendix.

* &lt;math&gt;\overline{GH} || \overrightarrow{DK}&lt;/math&gt; Line GH is parallel to ray DK
* &lt;math&gt;\angle 6 = 75^\circ&lt;/math&gt; Angle 6 = 75 degrees.
* &lt;math&gt;\angle 2 = 30^\circ&lt;/math&gt; Angle 2 = 30 degrees.  

'''Prove:''' Find the measure of each numbered angle in the figure above.
== Section 2.4: Proof by Contradiction ==
Proof by contradiction, also known as indirect proofs, prove that a statement is true by showing that the proposition's being false would imply a contradiction.

===A Classic Example: Proving that the Square Root of 2 is Irrational===
# Assume that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is a rational number, meaning that there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and an integer &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in general such that &lt;math&gt;a/b = \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Then &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a simplified fraction &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are coprime integers, that is, their greatest common divisor being 1.
# It follows that &lt;math&gt;a^2 / b^2 = 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a^2 = 2 b^2&lt;/math&gt;. &amp;emsp; (&amp;thinsp;&lt;math&gt;(a/b)^n = a^n/b^n&lt;/math&gt; &amp;thinsp;)
# Therefore &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; is even because it is equal to &lt;math&gt;2 b^2&lt;/math&gt;. (&lt;math&gt;2 b^2&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily even because it is 2 times another whole number and even numbers are multiples of 2.)
# It follows that ''a'' must be even (as squares of odd integers are never even).
# Because ''a'' is even, there exists an integer ''k'' that fulfills: &lt;math&gt;a = 2k&lt;/math&gt;.
# Substituting &lt;math&gt;2k&lt;/math&gt; from step 6 for ''a'' in the second equation of step 3: &lt;math&gt;2 b^2 = (2k)^2&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;2b^2 = 4k^2&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;b^2 = 2k^2&lt;/math&gt;.
# Because &lt;math&gt;2k^2&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by two and therefore even, and because &lt;math&gt;2k^2 = b^2&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt; is also even which means that ''b'' is even.
# By steps 5 and 8 ''a'' and ''b'' are both even, which contradicts that &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible as stated in step 2.
::'''''[[w:Q.E.D.|Q.E.D.]]'''''

Because there is a contradiction, the assumption (1) that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is a rational number must be false. By the law of excluded middle, that is, that a proposition can only be true or false, the opposite is proven: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dude, Pico de Gallo can be compared to salsa, but it is certainly not what North Americans mean when they say salsa. Flavor and water content are way different. If anything, it's Mexicans who call it Salsa de Mexicana because of the colors.

== tomatoes ==

What kind of tomato is good to use? Should it be peeled? seeds removed? [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 07:09, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

Yeah, this is a big omission. Pico should have tomatoes. Honestly, Dave? Campari on the vine tomatoes, de seeeded and chopped, are amazing in this version of pico. They're sweet, and offset the spice nicely. Personally, though, I use red onion rather than yellow or white. Most traditional pico, speaking from living in the tex mex region for a good while, uses red onions.</text>

Using Websites for Blended Learning in K-12
 
==Websites for Teachers==
The '''InnovaKids.com''' Check it out Now! [http://www.InnovaKids.com www.InnovaKids.com]
== Innovakids Classroom/School Website - Web Based Learning ==
site is designed as a full service Educational Website created to assist Teachers, Parents, Administrators and Students in centralizing the learning environment. This site is designed to integrate learning with classroom management. This site is designed for K to College. 

== Features ==
Online notebook for all your lessons, lesson plans, tests, quizzes, pacing plans, gradebook, student general information, etc... 
This is not a quiz system, this is a lesson system. Each question you create is connected to a concept page that teaches. Each concept is then connected to a standard. 
Automate your quizzes allowing students to access them from school or home. Give students a chance to retake exams until they learn the material. 
Automatically have Innovakids send you and the parents emails each time their child takes a quiz. 
Automatically send progress reports for an entire class to parents email with a single button click. 
Place class announcements online. 
Import lessons and lesson plans from other teachers all around the world. (Finally teacher lessons that work are shared and available throughout your department, school, district and the world) 
Create blog discussions about your lesson. Setup international chats with classes around the world. 
Place powerpoint lessons in an online environment using the innovakids lesson module, where you can access online for class demonstrations and direct instruction. (In Addition to sharing these with other teachers) But you have the added advantage of connecting each page of the powerpoint to an assessement question and students can access these lessons on their own) 
 
== THE INNOVAKIDS CONCEPT == 
 

The Innovakids.com concept integrates the requirements of classroom management with the overall Standardized Curriculum focus needed to move our students to Proficiency.   With the requirements of  NCLB (No Child Left Behind), schools are faced with the dilemma of finding innovative ways to teach our children differently.  The Innovakids site was created by teachers who saw a need for a tool to integrated the collaborative knowledge base of teachers across the nation into a centralized fully usable data-warehouse and interactive web based environment.  Not simple a system that allows teachers and parents to access grades online, or a system of computerizing tests with automated grading, but a fully integrated school system that centralizes all the content, lessons, quizzes, lesson plans, assessment, discipline, grade books, student management, curriculum, homework, progress reports and more into a system that individualizes the learning plans of each student and links these resource into the State Standards of Education. 

 
== INNOVAKIDS FEATURES  == 
 

Integrated Student Database  - The Innovakids database allows educators a web based interface to enter and access the basic student information needed in the course of a school year.  This database includes the student’s parent and home information, contact information as well as basic medical requirements.  Through this database the teacher can access phone numbers, addresses, and email accounts of the students parents and guardians. 
Grade book – The integrated grade book automatically is updated with grades as the students complete each lesson and assessment.  The teacher can add grades manually, edit grades or print progress and grade reports with the most current grade information.  Parents can access current grades online and well as receive emails of completed lessons and progress reports.  Teachers can print progress reports, charts and graphs and view real times reports and graphs as students are working. 
Student Schedules – Parents, teachers and students can view and print their entire school schedule through the web interface. 
Online Assessments – All lesson and class related assessments are available online for immediate grading or printable through the teacher interface.  These assessments are automatically graded and grades are immediately updated in the online grade book. 
Online Quizzes – Each lesson concept includes a question used for immediate evaluation of that concept. 
Online Lessons – In place of PowerPoint slides and Transparencies the Innovakids system allows teachers to build the concept slides directly into the site via web browser from any location.  Teacher may add video, sound, images, Concept information, and a question to each concept.  The slides are unlimited for each lesson although we recommend between 10 and 20 per lesson.  After the lessons are added on line they are available to any teacher using the system via the lesson library.  Each lesson is linked to a state standard and allows any teacher search by key word or by standard to see all the other lessons in the system associated to that standard.  
Automatic Emailing of Student Progress Reports – The most important feature is the email and mail function that allows students to receive lesson progress reports after each student completes their lesson.  This automatically send progress report list not only the name of lesson and associated standard but the questions and concepts that the student marked incorrectly and calculates and displays the students current grade for that class based on this completed lesson.  
Quizzes Integrated with online Lessons – Each concept in the lesson has an associated assessment question that is asked as the student reads the concept.  If the student marks the question incorrectly the system returns the student back to the concept page where that information was taught or can return the student back to the beginning of the lesson allowing for repetition of the lesson.  The grading for each lesson is determined via a calculated total of each concept question (even if the concept was repeated) divided by the number of questions answered correctly. (i.e. If the student answered 10 questions but had to re-answer  2 of the questions then the grade would be based on 12 total questions divided by the number that were answered correctly.) 
Administration Systems fully integrated – Graphs, Reports and Charts depicting overall teacher, standard, concept and student results from each lesson.  This system also reports on overall understanding and progress of each standard being taught by grade, ethnicity, teacher, team, or grouping. 
Lesson Plan sharing – Just like the online lessons the Lesson Plan Library is a central shareable library where teachers around the world can input lesson plans, link them to online lessons and standards.  These Lesson Plans will print in the Lesson Book at the end to assist the teacher in planning their class period activities. 
Import lessons and quizzes from other teachers  - The Online lesson library includes the ability to create new lessons and share them automatically with other teachers.  This allows teachers to search by keyword for related lessons or by standard for lessons that fit their particular pacing guide or curriculum.  Once these lessons and quizzes are imported the teacher may customize them to fit their needs. 
Progress Reports – Students, Parents and Teachers may print or view online a progress report for any class or a summary progress report for all classes.   These progress reports can also be automatically emailed to each student’s parents in a class with the pressing of one button or emailed to an individual’s parent.  The progress reports can also be printed for an entire class or individual student and includes a formatting that includes the parent’s name and address for mailing in windowed envelopes. 
Parent communication – The integration with parent communication tools is essential for the system.  This toolset includes: Online access for parents via the web; Mailed and automatically emailed progress reports; Automatically emailed lesson completion reports; Discipline reports (Referrals) automatically attached to progress reports (emailed, mailed, online or printed); Notification online of class and school events; Online communication with parents via email and discussion groups; Online chat rooms for parents to chat with administrators and teachers at set times. 
Teacher and Student Observations – Student observations are available for input by the teacher via the web.  
Student Team Management – Student teams in each class can be easily input into the system.  Teachers can quickly view what students are on what teams for assignments and assessment summarizing. 
Seating Charts – Student seating charts are online and easily accessible by teachers, subs and administrators. 
Curriculum Plan – District Pacing guides, Department Curriculum Plans and/or Teacher class curriculum plans are input online and easily available via the web. 
Classroom Management – The system is designed to give teachers a fully integrated classroom management system to centralize and share the resource used for each subject.  The Student management system allows for quick integrated access of addresses, phone numbers, discipline records, standardized test information, special ed information and academic information.  The concept is to allow teachers and administrators to enter information once and have it available to everyone who has permission and access rights. 
 
Student Information Management – All the basic information is placed online in the system and available to all those with access. 
Online Homework with ability for students to complete homework online  - Parent’s and students can access the web and view all the homework required for that class and all classes.  These assignments are automatically entered into the grade book when a teacher creates them and are available in the homework section of the automatic progress reports. 
Discipline - Online Referrals for Teachers with automatic printing on Progress Reports 
Individualize Learning Plans – The concept of Innovakids is to begin to manage many students with a system that treats each student as an individual learner.  This ILP approach presents a way for teachers to directly instruct the class according to the pacing guide and curriculum but allow students to move through the class at their own pace with immediate communication with the parent and teacher.  If a student requires a week to pass a lesson the system allows for that.  If a student needs to repeat a lesson 3 times before passing the system allows for that.  If a student can work ahead of a class the system allows for that. 
 

This section focuses on the use of websites in the classroom.  Classroom websites help facilitate the creation of a blended learning environment.  Teachers use classroom websites to post assignments, receive homework submissions, administer tests, and post grades and classroom policies.  Teachers also use classroom websites as the medium to link to blended learning sites such as external websites, videos, software, graphics, audio feeds, and virtual field trips.  In ''The Web-Enhanced Classroom'', Klaus Schmidt discusses four necessary components for successfully enhancing a course via the internet: Administration, Assessment, Content, and Community (Schmidt, 2002).  A classroom website is one way to implement these components into a web-enhanced course.  The classroom website acts as an extension to the teacher's administration toolkit.  Teachers can post links, assignments, grades, and communicate with students and parents all from their classroom website.

'''Teacher Resources''':

Teachers can incorporate blended learning into their classroom by linking resource sites and external websites to their classroom website.  The following is a list of useful links for teachers for blended learning activities:

*[http://www.marcopolo-education.org/home.aspx MarcoPolo: Internet Content for the Classroom] is a nonprofit consortium of education organizations dedicated to providing standards-based internet content and professional development for K-12 teachers and students.  Teachers can access lesson plans, student activities, and website reviews through seven content websites.  MarcoPolo also features a network of over 200,000 registered educators in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

*[http://www.nsf.gov/news/classroom/ National Science Foundation (NSF) Classroom Resources] is a collection of science and mathematics lesson plans, activities, and web resources for classroom teachers, their students, and parents.  NSF was created by Congress in 1950 as an independent federal agency &quot;to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense…&quot;. Most of these resources come from NSF's online library of resources for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. Collaborating partner institutions such as universities, museums, professional organizations, government agencies, research laboratories and publishers create content-rich materials to meet the needs of students and teachers at all levels: K-12, Higher Education and Lifelong Learning.

The use of a Course Management System (CMS) can assist a teacher when they are creating a blended learning environment in the K-12 classroom.  In addition to using a classroom website to communicate and administer classroom activities (as described in the previous section), a CMS can better assess student work, share course content and help develop a community among the teacher, students and parents.  

A CMS enables the administration of blended activities into the classroom through various tools included with the software. For example, a teacher is able to distribute handouts, set assignment deadlines, collect assignments and give quizzes from one location. This frees up time for the teacher.  As stated by Schmidt (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt; , “A well-developed administrative component allows a teacher to spend more time interacting creatively with students and addressing higher level thinking skills rather than on mundane activities.” 

Enhanced communication between the teacher and students is another administrative benefit gained from using a CMS. A teacher is able to post announcements to the entire class or send an individual email.  In addition, syllabus information, grading policies and deadlines can be clearly communicated. Communicating between teacher, students, and even parents, can also occur more frequently with the use of a CMS. Using a CMS means that “assignments and lecture notes can be posted in advance, and students can have continual access to them” (Zirke, 2003) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A teacher can distribute material to the class ahead of time, as well as archive previous material, allowing the flexibility for students to work at their own pace or refer back to previous content.  

Course Management Systems also assist teachers in assessing student learning.  “One great advantage of assessing student learning via the Internet is the ability to provide instant feedback to the student” (Schmidt, 2002) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Instant feedback can reinforce learning a lesson being taught and gives the teacher an opportunity to reach a student that may have missed a concept.  A useful feature of a CMS is the ability for teachers to easily create quizzes.  No programming or HTML knowledge is necessary because the CMS provides a quiz function.  An added advantage of the quiz function in a CMS is the ability to offer multiple quizzes and tests for the students to use for practice.  Schmidt (2002) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  states, “a teacher can facilitate a random selection of test questions each time a student want to retake a quiz for practice purposes on the same subject matter.”   The CMS collects, grades, and records the score of the quizzes and tests, saving valuable time for a teacher.  With a password, each student can access his or her individual grades.  A parent could have a password, as well, to monitor the progress of his or her child by going online at any time of the day.

A CMS enables a teacher to implement blended learning activities into their K-12 classroom in a more organized and functional way.  Using a CMS for routine classroom administration tasks is an added bonus, providing the teacher with time for enhanced instruction.   

Website resources are available for teachers to compare a variety of Course Management Systems.  One website, [http://www.edutools.info/course/ EduTools], gives product information, product comparisons, and student feedback.  Although a variety of CMS exist, this section focuses on six main CMS examples (WebCT, Blackboard, Moodle, CCNet, ANGEL, and Desire2Learn).

==Desire2Learn==
K-12, Higher Ed, Corporations and Health Care Organizations have been using the [http://www.desire2learn.com/products Desire2Learn Learning Management System]  (LMS) since 1999 (www.desire2learn.com). 
The product, the [http://www.desire2learn.com/learningenvironment/ Desire2Learn® Learning Environment], is a web-based suite of teaching and learning tools for course development, delivery and management. Desire2Learn's Learning Environment provides ways to control the environment to match your approach to teaching and learning, and provides tools to help facilitate communication, collaboration and community building. Educators can customize courses by using a variety of multimedia files.  Desire2Learn has several tools that are useful to online educators including email, glossaries, [http://www.desire2learn.com/competencies/ competencies] , Rubrics, [http://www.desire2learn.com/liveroom/ LiveRoom®] and the [http://www.desire2learn.com/eportfolio/ ePortfolio].

==Blackboard==
&quot;Through a network of state, regional and local districts, Blackboard serves over 1,200 U.S. schools in 46 states&quot; (www.blackboard.com, 2005). Blackboard &quot;provides software solutions that help manage online academic environments. Blackboard's Course &amp; Portal Solutions for example, provides online course management, academic communities and administrative services&quot; (Schmidt, 2002). Teacher Vivian Evans, gives a personal account of Blackboard, stating that &quot;Blackboard has got some good features...It supports synchronous chat and discussion threads in a way that is very clear. Site administration is another strength. You can control who has access to your site. You can also look back at what happened previously by clicking on a past date to see what was discussed&quot; (Evans, 2005) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the [http://www.blackboard.com Blackboard webite], &quot;Whether a student is hospital or homebound, a traveling athlete or involved in extra-curricular activities, the Blackboard Learning System allows students to take courses online or supplement face-to-face learning&quot; (2005) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is done through the &quot;Virtual Classroom/Collaboration feature&quot; which offers synchronous chats and office hours. Blackboard also has an &quot;Assignments&quot; feature, allowing students to receive feedback from the teacher after submitting an assignment through Blackboard (www.blackboard.com, 2005).

==Moodle==
According to the [http://www.moodle.org Moodle Website], &quot;Moodle is a course management system (CMS) - a free, Open Source software package designed using sound pedagogical principles, to help educators create effective online learning communities&quot; (2005). Moodle is used in a variety of settings by a variety of institutions, such as universities, schools, companies, and teachers, throughout the world. Specifically, Moodle is used in universities, high schools, primary schools, non-profit organizations, private companies, by independent teachers and parents home schooling their children (Moodle Background, 2005). What makes Moodle truly unique is the price tag; Moodle is completely free to use (www.moodle.com, 2005).

Moodle does not require the installation of any particular software; it can be created, edited, and used solely online.  The creation and editing system is user-friendly and seems to have been designed with the novice user in mind.  Templates encourage clear organization of assignments and resources, and forums are also simple to create.  Likewise, the student user will quickly learn the simple navigation system with little frustration.

Moodle was created by Martin Dougiamas, a former university webmaster and system administrator of the university's WebCT installation. Dougiamas states that he &quot;encountered many frustrations with the WebCT beast and developed an itch that needed scratching - there had to be a better way (no, not Blackboard :-)&quot; (Moodle Background, 2005). In order to do this, Dougiamas believes that &quot;it is crucial...that this software be easy to use - in fact it should be as intuitive as possible&quot; (Moodle Background, 2005).

==CCNet == 


According to the [http://www.myccnet.com/ CCNet website], &quot;CCNet is a web-based course management and class communication tool. It provides a powerful teaching and study management solution for students, teachers, and administrative staff. CCNet is extremely user friendly and designed to meet the needs of all types of institutions. It has been used with great success by prominent schools and universities as well as individual teachers and professors since its unveiling in September, 2000.&quot;

 
==ANGEL Learning == 


According to the [http://www.angellearning.com/ ANGEL website] ANGEL LMS provides a set of teaching and learning features that are open to adaptation. ANGEL's openness allows faculty and information technology professionals to focus on delivering good teaching. It allows the enterprise to control the capabilities it delivers to its users and add the learning content, resources, and technologies that best fit its users' needs.  ANGEL Learning was acquired by Blackboard in May, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blackboard.com/Company/Media-Center/Press-Releases.aspx?releaseid=1285265|title= Blackboard to Acquire ANGEL Learning, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==eChalk==
According to the [http://www.echalk.com/ eChalk website], eChalk provides K-12 schools and educational environments with the necessary tools for students, parents and teachers to obtain a thriving academic community.  

eChalk facilitates both cooperative and collaborative learning models.  A cooperative learning model is used more often in lower education because it is a simpler and more teacher-led style of learning.  Students obtain some necessary learning skills, but this learning style mainly serves to prepare students for collaborative learning.  Collaborative learning is a higher form of learning that usually occurs in late middle and upper school.  The students have much more independence and room to explore in their learning.  Collaborative learning helps students learn more than just the required subject material; the students also learn crucial learning tools and how to work independently.

eChalk allows the teachers to alter their class pages according to the learning style of the class.  The teacher can lead the students every step of the way by posting many assignments and communicating constantly (this is an example of cooperative learning) or simply posting a subject matter and leaving the students to learn and explore on their own (this is an example of collaborative learning).  These two learning styles are available to the students 24x7 because eChalk brings learning outside the classroom and into the homes of the students.

The company was co-founded by Daniel Watts and Torrance Robinson in 1999 in an initiative to bring computers and internet access to schools in New York.  However, the project has now spread across the U.S.

Blending online and face to face instructors and learners

As stated in the introduction to this chapter, one of the criticisms of Blended Learning is that the definition lacks specificity. (Oliver and Trigwell, 2005) As a result, many of the characteristics of Blended learning look so similar to one another that it is impossible to tell them apart. The characteristics seem to have different terms that describe the same set of criteria. Such is the case for the blending of online and face to face instructors and learners. 

After several rounds of disucssion, the contributors of this chapter were unable to elucidate the difference between &quot;Blending online and face to face instructors and learners&quot; from &quot;Blending synchronus and asynchronus learning&quot; and &quot;Online and offline Learning.&quot;

The only possible difference that we discussed is that in a Blended Learning environment, the line between instructor and learner might be blurred, so that the instructor is not just the person disseminating knowledge, but rather a member of the learning community, who contributes to the construction of knowledge, and takes away from the course re-imagined understandings of the content. In other words, as one Instructor who utilizes blended learning put it, the teacher should be &quot;the guide on the side, instead of the sage on the stage.&quot; (Scagnoli, 2005)</text>

But you forgot to add that to this page which shows that any manual soulution is inferior to a automatic solution. But then - I only make suggestions. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:09, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

== Concatenation? ==

I am not a Ruby pro but my understanding is that there are at least three ways to concatenate strings: the plus (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;) operator; adjacent string literals; and perhaps what I would normall consider the shift operator (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;). Is that right? Why are none of them documented here? --[[User:X883|X883]] ([[User talk:X883|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/X883|contribs]]) 19:55, 29 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Fortran 90/95 vs. Fortran 77 */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

You might want to consider the [[WB:NP]]. You current naming convention is depreciated and has several disadvantages - like it has no navigational links. Also you worthy effort is neiter considered a book nor a section inside a book. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistats] which implements an exstensive book and section detector.

== Fortran 90/95 vs. Fortran 77 ==

I'll be helping developing this wikibook, as I'm currently doing a project in Fortran. However, I will concentrate on Fortran 90/95, and not Fortran 77. Right now they are intertwined with each other, so I will segregate the tutorials for Fortran 77 into a separate section, if there are no objections.
--[[User:Arthurv|Arthurv]] 11:49, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

Why would a 2006 Fortran book begin by discussing problems with Fortran 77? Just delete all the 77 stuff - its 30 years old.  And its already online if anyone wants it -- see
* {{cite book
  | first = Clive G.
  | last = Page
  | year = January 1988
  | title = The Professional Programmer's Guide to FORTRAN 77
  | edition = 1st ed.
  | publisher = Hyperion Books
  | id = ISBN 0273028561
  }}  Out of print and now [http://rsusu1.rnd.runnet.ru/develop/fortran/prof77/prof77.html online].

I've never looked at a Wiki book before, so there is a lot (everything?) that I don't know about them.  Unless all Wiki books have the same purpose, it would help if this book began with what its purpose is, what it will and will not do.  If readers don't know the purpose of the book, makes it hard to comment on (that's an argument for knowing the purpose, not for concealing it!).

: Fortran 77 is still alive and well. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 07:25, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

:: Despite its age F77 is still very commonly used in scientific computing. However, it would be very good idea to make separate wikibook for F77 and F90/95 standards. Even thought they are not very far different, they are different enought to do so. Now this is like making a same textbook for german and dutch... [[User:130.232.104.44|130.232.104.44]] 12:22, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

::: I would hardly compare German and Dutch. Perhaps Dutch and Flemish would be more apt. F90/95 is, moreover, (mostly?) backwards compatible with F77. [http://h21007.www2.hp.com/dspp/files/unprotected/Fortran/docs/lrm/dflrm.htm The Compaq Fortran Language Reference Manual] designates extensions to the F95 standard with a different colour text. A pretty neat solution in my mind. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 20:32, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
:::: F77 is forward compatible with f90 and not the other way around. [[User:128.220.23.214|128.220.23.214]] 01:04, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

Fortran 77 should definitely neither be deleted from, nor ignored by this book. Right now I have to learn Fortran 77 to find my way round a (scientific) program, that was written in the late 80's and is to be extended by me. And I'm very thankful for those tutorials that still exist in the web. I suggest not to make seperate books, but different chapters of the different versions. Compare [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran] for inspiration. (You'll get the idea, even if you don't understand any German.) -- [[User:Macumba|Macumba]] ([[User talk:Macumba|talk]]) 13:41, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

I work in science and there is a lot of existing fortran code around, most that I have dealt with is fortran 77. It is common to need to read an modify this code. However most people have moved from g77 to gfortran compiler, so you could call it fortran90/95 that happens not to use the new features. For it would be most useful to have F90/95 book, with comments about what is new, and examples of old/obsolete features (that should maybe be avoided or removed). [[Special:Contributions/194.36.2.211|194.36.2.211]] ([[User talk:194.36.2.211|discuss]]) 16:50, 9 December 2011 (UTC)

== Fortran vs. FORTRAN ==

The current spelling of Fortran does not use all capital letters, so I have changed &quot;FORTRAN&quot; to &quot;Fortran&quot;, except when FORTRAN 77 or an earlier version of the language is being referenced.</text>

== Top ten active ==

The top ten active users and wikibooks list hasn't been changed for over three months now! If the features that updates these parts isn't available any more, they should be taken off the front page, as it makes it look out of date and neglected. If, however, there is a way availabe, why isn't it up to date? --[[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 18:42, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I totaly agree. I haven't been visiting wikibooks for long, but the fact that the first thing that a visitor sees is a list dating back from march, gives the feeling that &quot;This site is no longer updated.&quot;  [[User:Almogo|Almogo]] 21:00, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Agreed. If this section is not updated by an automated process, ''or'' some standards are put in place to define whose responsibility it is to update it and when, it should be removed from the front page. It is likely to confuse visitors otherwise. They may think that they are getting a (really old) cached page, or that the site it dead. Are there any standards in place already which cover these issues? [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:18, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: There are instructions on how to do it somewhere (i've lost the page), but it requires downloading a 200 meg SQL dump and the link to said dump is incorrect. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 19:52, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:: This is hardly a solution. I don't believe I have the necessary permissions to change this page, but someone ought to. Still, the administrative system does not guarantee that any of the people who are able to sort this out are still active users of the system, nor even alive. This needs to be resolved. To keep this site ordered, meaningful and up-to-date, responsibilities must to taken on by, or assigned to specific users. If those users cease to become active users, the responsibilites must be transferred. Anarchy must not prevail, or else the site will eventually degrade into rubbish and meaninglessness.

:: This is not the only problem. The system for organising and catergorising books also needs an overhaul. The different means of indexing books and pages are out of sync, and confusing, especially for new users. Even the distinction betweeen what is a book, and what is merely a page of a book is poorly defined. I also noticed no indications regarding sensible use of namespaces. [[Appendix|This page]], for example, seems completely out of place. Perhaps the wiki software is to blame. I guess it works well for Wikipedia, since it is only a single book, and the namespace usage is fairly obvious, but I don't think it works here without more guidelines.

:: The fundamental problem here is with language. Everyone has their own interpretation of what different words actually mean. If people are to co-operate effectively, meanings of words within specific contexts must be well-defined. In a way, this is the whole point of Wikipedia, which is why it works much better than Wikibooks.

:: For an example, check out the work I've been doing on [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas/Meta|this page]] and its sub-pages. By keeping track of naming standards, pages, templates, and images, it's so much easier to create a comprehensive guide, whilst minimising namespace pollution, and simplifying the process of restructuring a book, without having to rename pages. Perhaps something akin to this on a global level might also prove successful. Certainly some reflexive system of rules ought to be very effective. I am reminded of the ''game theory'' game of [[w:Nomic|Nomic]]. If you ignore the scoring system, this is effectively what we have been doing with our own naming standards, by discussing and modifying the rules based on our discussions.

:: Any thoughts?

:: [[User:Aya|Aya]] 17:01, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: Hm, it's now July. Nobody around who can remove that list from March? I think it looks much better if it is removed completely, than letting it be outdated by half a year. Allefant, 9 July 2005
: Completely agree. Can someone PLEASE remove this or update? It looks utterly tacky. Serge July 9, 2005 01:54 (UTC)
: '''Update''': I've discovered the problem with the DB dumps. There's an erroneous line:

 /* &lt;something here&gt; */;

: This needs to be removed from the file before you can import into MySQL. Now if someone can tell me where the scripts are to generate the stats, I can get this done. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 21:31, 9 July 2005 (UTC)

:: I assume, this is the complete process to get the wiki code for it: {{bad link|Wikibooks:Top_active/SQL_query/March_2005}}. All done in SQL. And Do you have permission to update the list? If so - maybe you can temporarily remove the outdated list, until you (or the original author) manages to re-run the SQL? [[User:Allefant|Allefant]] 06:50, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

::: I've temporarily removed the out-of-date info from the page, and provided a link instead should someone eventually get this data sorted out. It's somewhat dependent on getting up-to-date DB dumps, and the last one there is too old to generate up-to-date statistics from. I'm also unconvinced that the data set is as up-to-date as it claims. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:55, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

:::: Thanks, I really think it makes the front page look better for now. And I hope this gets sorted out, maybe whoever runs the server can install a script to produce a monthly activity report from the DB automatically.. [[User:Allefant|Allefant]] 20:12, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== Remove of book listings on the front page? ==

* Just too many books to list here
* When you click on a topic, the list of books under that topic are most likely different then the books on the front page (either the author adds it to the topic listing or directly to the front page). 

Lets just simplify it and put all the books on topic pages and have one or two books per day/per topic as &quot;books of the day&quot; for the front page--[[User:RobKohr|RobKohr]] 17:17, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Book of the month ==

I would like to suggest a &quot;book of the month&quot;, similar to how it is working in the [[de:Hauptseite|German version of Wikibooks]], because it seems to work quite well there: Every month all registered Wikibook users can vote from a couple of nominated books for beeing next month's &quot;book of the month&quot;. I guess Wikibooks is maturing to allow for 12 excellent books to be displayed on the main page a year (similar to Wikipedia's &quot;Featured article&quot;). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 18:39, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: I would like to reserve at least a quarter of the main page for the [[Wikibooks:Book of the month|Book of the month]], to increase the value of this award. In the future this should preferably be a well-selected picture with some introductory text to the &quot;book of the month&quot;. In the last week of January, I would like to increase the interest in the vote by placing a '''picture of a big question mark''' '''&quot;?&quot;''' with the last call for voting. I will try to set something up during the next couple of days on my user subpages, and present it here first. If somebody could create a really cool kind of questionmark (maybe floating above a book, ...) that would be great! Otherwise, I would probably only contribute a very simple question mark. Also if you have other suggestions for this, let me know. (PS: Googling around, one can find a few very nice question marks, but I'm not sure whether I can just upload them to the commons?) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 08:15, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:: Here is my suggestion for the change of the main page: [[User:Andreas_Ipp/Main_Page_suggestion]]. If you have administrator right, all you have to do is put these three lines
 &lt;nowiki&gt;===Book of the month===&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Book of the month}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- so that next header starts below picture --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: before this line. 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;===About Wikibooks===&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: (The main page has been locked just a week ago by [[User:Gentgeen]], and I don't have administrator rights). Thank you very much! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 12:57, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::: I just found out that the main page was not locked anymore, and I made the change by myself. :-) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 13:17, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Change Featured Wikibooks to Most Active Wikibooks ==

* Since the book of the month (see above) would take the role of the &quot;Featured Wikibooks&quot;, I would suggest to rename Featured Wikibooks to &quot;Most Active Wikibooks&quot; - and list the, say, '''Top 5 of currently active Wikibooks''' (that means highest number of contributors in the last month (can be checked e.g. by &quot;Related changes&quot; or by a still to be defined [[m:Requests_for_queries|SQL query]]). 
* &quot;New Wikibooks&quot; is fine, as books get rotated through, but..
* &quot;Struggling Wikibooks&quot; is quite undefined. It is not clear who can add books to this category and who will take them away again. Either it should be also organized in a kind of rotating manner (add books with a date and delete the first in list), or by some kind of voting system.
* &quot;Wikijunior&quot; is just promotional, but to be fair it should contain a link to the [[m:Wikijunior|Wikijunior background]], stating that it is a project started by the Beck Foundation approaching the Wikimedia Foundation.  --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 19:17, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I replaced Featured and Struggling Wikibooks by {{bad link|Wikibooks:Top active}}. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:24, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Here the last featured and struggling books:

'''Featured Wikibooks'''
{{tl|Featured}}  

'''Struggling Wikibooks'''  
* [[Open Source]] {{stage|50%|Jan 19, 2005}}
* [[Visual Basic]] {{stage|50%|Dec 30, 2004}}
* {{bad link|Art}} {{stage|00%|Oct 17, 2004}}
* [[Alchemy]] {{stage|00%|Sep 23, 2004}}

== Changing new books template ==

I would like to suggest moving Template:New to Template:Newbooks.  I already started Template:Newbooks.  I was going to go ahead with it myself, but I noticed the Main page is locked which would prevent this from happening without an Administrator stepping in.  I suggest this change because I noticed its being used elsewhere by accident from copying over help pages from Wikimedia.  Wikimedia uses Template:New for another perpose.  So far only two pages are effected by this cross over, [[Help:Editing#Edit summary|Help:Edit summary]] and [[Help:Tracking changes#Page history|Help:Page history]]. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 19:06, Jun 12, 2005 (UTC)

:Okay, but don't just fork off a new page (now removed). You should instead set up a redirect until the point where an administrator has changed the page. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 20:06, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== Removal of Wikibooks display from main page ==

It seems obvious that Wikibooks is growing a lot and taking up too much space on the [[Main Page]]. I've replaced the display of Wikibooks with a link to the [[Wikibooks:Departments|template]]. This way, there's an entire page devoted to all active Wikibooks.

The Main Page should be developed further so that it has more interesting and useful information such as &quot;[[Wikibooks:Book of the month/February 2005 voting|Book of the month]]&quot;. I hope this is acceptable to everyone. [[User:Mkn|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]-- [[User talk:Mkn|Mkn]] 12:44, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: Hi Mnk! Your changes are just in the spirit of presenting a clear and concise first page for both, first-time visitors and active Wikibook users. You should be careful though, that there are several versions of the homepage (standard, table-free, and text-only), and you adjusted only one of them. 
: I personally like to have the template of all Wikibooks on the first page, because it gives a richer view of what kind of books can be found, and your link (&quot;all ... can be found '''here'''&quot;) is not prominent enough that each first-time user will click on it. I hope you will accept that I revert this change, and put the template back in. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 13:25, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: Follow-up: I think, in the future we should try by keeping the main page more clean not by removing the bookshelves template, but by carefully commenting out books that look like stubs (they will still stay fully prominent on the bookshelf itself - just not in the template - and as soon as there is reasonable activity, they can be put back again on the main page). What do you think about this? --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 13:30, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::I agree with Andreas: The link wasn't at all prominent and it's doubtful that (1) a new user would even see the link; and (2) that a user would be likely to click on it. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 15:06, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::OK Andreas Ipp. I also thought about that but I'm not sure how else to make it more obvious to navigate to the active wikibooks. I just thought there's a need to seperate the books from the main page. Or maybe I'm following Wikipedia design too closely. [[User:Mkn|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]-- [[User talk:Mkn|Mkn]] 21:21, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:::I just came back from a seminar by Edward Tufte: I think we need not be affraid of having links to many different books, people can figure out the scrolling part. I think the information is still navagatable because people can easily find the section they want. (For example, it's not hard even scanning just 5% of the words to find the computer science or biology or any other sections.) Perhaps to handle scalability we'll want maybe some icons next to the sections: your typical Sigmas for mathematics, Atoms and beakers for science, Computers for computer science... But even without icons listing the books is still ok. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:57, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Top 10 active ==

Shouldn't this be by the most edits in the past whatever (month week day, etc.) instead of number of users who've edited it.  1000 minor edits by different users doesn't make it more active than 20 major edits of around 1 page each (for instance, I know I'm exaggerating people).  Also, as of now, someone's replaced the arrow pics and it's really ugly with those HUGE green arrows, it looked better before.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 23:49, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
: 1) Hi Naryathegreat. About the ranking: I wanted to make this list an indicator for the '''community effort''' on a book. In this sense, having 20 different people looking into a book and making a small edit each indicates more community interest and activity than 20 edits by one single user. This way, you get those books to the top that might interest most people (and not very specialized books that only 1 or 2 people really understand - they edit their books anyway...). That's the idea behind it. But I might take up your idea and publish a second list which ranks all books according to total number of contributions. It might be interesting what comes out there.
: 2) Someone (User Everlong at Commons) replaced 2 of the 3 arrows in use by smaller ones, without changing the pixel number in the template. I reduced it now from 20px to 12px. Let me know if it looks nicer now on your screen (on mine the arrows did not get enlarged and did not seem so huge).--[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:29, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== March book of month ==

It's March now so shouldn't there be a new book of the month?[[User:Bawolff|Bawolff]] 19:48, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: The book of march is HSE, it is present on the main page with introductory text and a picture. If you can not see it, either you have to refresh your browser cache (by forcing a reload), or the wiki-server provides an old version - for whatever reasons - to you. Try to log out, and have a look at the main page. You should see the change. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 21:07, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Thanks I see it now [[User:Bawolff|Bawolff]] 01:46, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Top 10 active for March? ==

We're halfway through April.  Shouldn't the homepage show the top 10 active for March instead of February?  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 22:19, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: The March statistics are now on the main page. There has been a slight delay, because the statistics are based on the database dumps which have been released a few days after April started, and it then takes a couple of days until I find time to process the data by SQL scripts. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 15:36, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Main Page Graphics ==

Wikipedia is a thoroughly socialist venture, however whoever thought that the symbol of Soviet Russia is a good symbol to proclaim this with should read the Wikipedia article on the USSR, lol. Pretty rediculous and offensive.

:It was just vandalism, if you didn't figure that out yet...  See [[m:Power structure]] for a discussion of the political model of the wikis. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 12:26, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Just a comment on the numb-nuts who put it there.

== main page looks screwed up ==

theres a big '''wikibooks in other languages''' right in the middle of the mathamatics section. [[User:Bawolff|Bawolff]] 01:34, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Templates not getting updated? ==

I updated the BOTM and COTM templates, but it's not showing on the main page. What's going on? [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 10:48, 1 Jul 2005 (UTC)
: There is an issue with how the main page refreshes within your browser.  I'm having problems myself (using Mozilla).  Normally it isn't a problem, but consider that if you have made changes, that it has taken effect.  If you close your browser down and restart it, you should see the new changes, for instance.  Ugly soultion, I know, but it does work.  Now if somebody could give a good explaination....  I think it has something to do with the expiration setting for the main page, as sent out by the MediaWiki software.  I don't seem to have any problems beyond the front page.[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:52, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

== Blender description ==

Hi all,

I'd like to thank all those that voted for the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] book for book of the month!  But also, I was wondering if somebody could change the description of what Blender is on the homepage with the book of the month listing.  Right now it says this:

&quot;Blender 3D/Noob to Pro is a book that explains how to use the 3D modeling program blender.&quot;

But the Blender is so much more than just a 3D modeling program.  Maybe something like this would be more accurate:

&quot;Blender 3D/Noob to Pro is a book that explains how to use the Blender, the open source 3D creation suite.&quot;

I have taken it upon myself to try to keep books older than a month off &quot;New Wikibooks&quot; - can we get some consensus maybe to change this to two weeks? The box is getting far too big and cumbersome, like the rest of the Main Page. [[User:Serge|Serge]] 10:32, July 16, 2005 (UTC)

: I'm not sure I like it either. What do you think ought to be on the main page? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:01, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

I'm in the process of working out a new proposed structure for the Wikibooks main page but as an interim measure I am removing all books written over two weeks ago from the &quot;New Wikibooks&quot; to save on screen clutter. If there is major objections the following books were removed.

* [[Database Law]] {{stage|25%|July 4, 2005}}
* [[Portuguese grammar]] {{stage|00%|July 3, 2005}}
* [[Render a SolidWorks Model in Maya]] {{stage|50%|July 2, 2005}}
* [[Software engineering]] {{stage|00%|July 1, 2005}}
* [[Accelerando Technical Companion]] {{stage|25%|June 30, 2005}}
* [[Web Design]] {{stage|25%|June 29, 2005}}
* [[How to try sushi for the first time]] {{stage|50%|June 29, 2005}}
* [[Samba]] {{stage|00%|June 28, 2005}}
* {{bad link|Computer Magazine}} {{stage|00%|June 28, 2005}}
* [[How To Tie A Tie]] {{stage|50%|June 27, 2005}}
* [[Ten Stupid Things Beginners Do to Mess Up Their Contradance Experience]] {{stage|50%|June 25, 2005}}
* [[How To Build A Pykrete Bong]] {{stage|75%|June 24, 2005}}
* [[Raising Chickens]] {{stage|50%|June 24, 2005}}
* [[AQA Information and Communication Technology]] {{stage|25%|June 20, 2005}}

Sorry about the rushed decision its just if someone is not bold then who will be? 

I am going to start an experimental test front page so we can collaborate on a better..well, front page. It's here [[User:Serge/Experimental front page|Experimental front page]] - [[User:Serge|Serge]] 09:31, July 19, 2005 (UTC)

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5%&quot;&gt;
Okay. But I wouldn't expect too many other people with enough passion to help to change your fork of the [[Main page]]. Have a look through the rest of this talk page, and some of the issues raised in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] to see what other users think should and shouldn't be on the main page. A few common suggestions:

* Removal of any ephemeral content not being kept up to date (i.e. Top Tens).
* Removal of complete book listings from the bottom. One of my other projects is to sort out the bookshelves, but it's a big job. I'm still deciding on a classification scheme (Dewey is the best I can think of right now).
* Some sort of obvious link for newbies to send them to a page to help get them up to speed if they are new to wiki-based systems. Preferably get them off the site completely, and on to a safe test site. (see: [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#Newbies]]).

Once you get a main page you're happy with, post a note in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] to get the attention of an admin who can actually make the appropriate changes to the real main page. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:28, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
&lt;/div&gt;

== Top Ten Users ==

Top ten Users is now a long list of XXX sites.  Please remove.

:Done. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 03:40, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

To: Donovan -- same thing happens again ... top 10 users all XXX sites.

: See [[#Important notice regarding main page|Important notice regarding main page]] - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:02, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

== Trolling warning ==

We need to start trolling a bit. We need to look for dead, or completely stupid books and stop them from spreading. Neospeak and Excuses(?) are just two examples. People, we can do better than that.

:Potential contributors are reminded to take a good look at [[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks is not]] before starting any new book, this is to prevent any later ill feeling. Note, in particular, that every book is expected to act primarily as an instructional resource (e.g., a manual). Any books that fall outside these guidelines, unfortunately, risks being deleted.

== Personal Wikibooks? ==

'''Note''': For clarity, I have abandoned the wiki practice of each user replying at the same indent level throughout the post. I tend to split up large chunks of other posts, and reply to each part separately. Indent levels ought to represent temporal distictions (i.e. what chat came first) rather than user distinctions.

I'd like to express my concern that there's a section on the main page, under 'New Wikibooks', called 'Personal Projects'. I'm not sure whether this has been debated before, I couldn't find evidence of any discussion here or in the staff lounge, but surely this type of thing doesn't really belong on Wikibooks? I mention this here first as I don't know whether this is merely pseudo-vandalism of the main page, or wether a decision has been made by the community at large to allow this kind of thing. I point out that in the prologue of one of the books under that section actively discourages anything other than minor editing. [[User:Lor|Lor]] 18:05, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

: This is entirely my doing, so you may fairly point the 'finger of blame' squarely at me. See [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#Unreliable administrative system]] for justifications. Note that the pages linked to in the &quot;Personal Projects&quot; are all subpages of user pages. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:32, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

:: I'm in agreement with Aya. Maybe there is some way to make clear that &quot;personal projects&quot; should be subpages of user pages but otherwise we need somewhere to put NPOV books. -  [[User:Serge|Serge]] 09:52, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

::: Considering the enormity of this project, trying to make anything 'clear' is nigh impossible. See [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#Policy visibility]]. I did add a note to the top of the page [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]], but again, we're perhaps incorrectly assuming that users have even bothered to read it. I'm beginning to think that the only workable solution is to just exemplify good practise in your edits (especially on highly visible pages), and hope people copy your examples. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:: I think we are in denial if we think that books can really remain totally NPOV (when was the last time you read something that was completely NPOV) but we do need a way of seperating these type of books from strictly neutral instructional books. -  [[User:Serge|Serge]] 09:52, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

::: 'NPOV' is a bad expression. Even [[w:Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|Wikipedia's version]] has reams of clarification to get around that fact that 'neutral point of view' is a bad choice of words, since every 'language lawyer' attempts to pick it to pieces. See also [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#NPOV (Neutral Point Of View)]]. Perhaps it's just sufficient to say &quot;anything you write in the main namespace can be edited by anyone, so if you write anything contentious, don't expect it to stay there&quot;. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:::: That sounds like a good idea. One idea I have for the front page is a segment to inform newbies/actually any other editors - eg. with link to sandbox, syntax help. Maybe we could have a prominent link to a page explaining what you've written above. [[User:Serge|Serge]] 08:32, July 26, 2005 (UTC)

::::: Already addressed in [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#Newbies]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 26 July 2005 (UTC) 

:: The other point I might add is that at the moment neither the breadth  nor the depth to deny space on the Main Page to projects that have content on them. Although I realize we need some sort of &quot;new book recognition&quot; as incentive I dislike the idea of huge slabs of page space being given to books that hardly have any content. Any ideas for new segments featuring books with substantial content, anyone? [[User:Serge|Serge]] 09:52, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

::: The closest thing we have right now are the percentage images to indicate potential completion, and the 'book of the month' to indicate that a work is comprehensive enough to be worthy of the title. If you can think of a better idea, I'd be pleased to hear it. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:::: Another idea: I was thinking that if we have a prominent listing of all bookshelves we could start to have a rotating &quot;Feature/Completed/Whatever You Want to call it&quot; book for each shelf. I will endeavour (but no promises) to try to find time to work this into my [[User:Serge/Experimental front page|experimental front page]] (BTW well done Aya on the [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks|critique of wikibooks.]] Lots of goood suggestion) [[User:Serge|Serge]] 08:23, July 26, 2005 (UTC)

::::: Sounds like a good idea, but the bookshelves are in serious need of tidying first. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

:: I certainly don't want to point a finger of blame at anyone, and I must say Aya that your Critique looks extremely thorough, well researched, and relevant. My concern is that these 'personal wikibooks' are actively discouraging collaboration, and editing. It promotes the idea that a certain wikibook is &quot;my wikibook&quot;. Now, I completely agree that there are some NPOV topics, and books about non-NPOV subjects (and I ask any readers to humour me for the moment and accept the general definition of non-NPOV in its broadest and most accepted sense) that simply -can't- be collaborations between many people - can you imagine a collaborative &quot;Critique of Wikibooks&quot;? It would be an all out edit war, of course. I agree that these books must necessarily be personal. My point is that they perhaps need another forum for promotion. The main page of Wikibooks is a medium for the promotion of Wikibooks as an extension of Wikipedia, and as such for Wikibooks that encourage collaboration, and bold editing by many users. As a quick example, a Wikibook entitled &quot;Critique of Wikibooks by Aya&quot; would, to me, be against the philosophy of Wikibooks - but a Wikibook entitled &quot;Various Critiques of Wikibooks&quot;, as a collaborative effort showing various user's critiques of Wikibooks, would be very much acceptable.

:: I'm often very rambly; I realised that I can sum up my position very quickly. I don't think that sub-pages of user-pages should be promoted on the Wikibooks main page - especially as personal projects. [[User:Lor|Lor]] 20:51, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

::: Ah. Now I see what you mean. First of all, I've noticed that both of these 'Personal projects' have passed their two-week period, and have now been removed. Also note I have removed the 'Personal projects' section until this dispute is sorted out.

::: The reason I originally put the section in, is that some guy kept trying to advertise his somewhat less NPOV work on the main page (in various inappropriate templates thereof), and there's not a lot you can do to stop it, so I decided a good compromise might be to allow it, providing it was a link to one of the guy's user pages, and clearly separated from the communal books. In a way, the work was a set of the user's own personal philisophies, and I think adding these things to your user page shouldn't necessarily be discouraged, since it can only serve to help users to better understand each other. In hindsight, I perhaps should have made the distinction more clear, but the main page is protected, and thus awkward to edit.

::: I guess I have somewhat shamelessly exploited the main page to promote my own work, but I did want to get as many opinions on the subjects there before I start making any radical changes, and that seemed like a good place to advertise. The point is, I could've put my book in the main namespace, and made it a community work, but I was worried it might spiral out of control without consistent editorial control. In a way, all it is, is a summary of the various issues that have arisen in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] and other pages which serve a similar role as a forum of discussion. Sure, it's possibly not NPOV, or it's possibly 'primary/original research', but I figured it was ''useful'' (at least to me, but I've received several complimentary comments from other users), and ''usefulness'' seems to be the determining factor in [[WB:VFD]].

::: Editorial control is really the distinction between these two categories. I feel some books benefit from having a primary editor, whereas others may not. Would this be a better way of wording the main page? If not, what would you suggest?

::: Also note that some of the more regular users here are trying to re-assess the whole Wikibooks project, and its goals/policies/guidelines/procedures/practices/scope. There's currently some discussion going on in [[&lt;nowiki&gt;User talk:KelvSYC#Re: [Textbook-l] Proposal for major policy overhaul&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] (one of our more active administrators). If you have something constructive to add, I'm certain it would be appreciated. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:41, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

== Books that don't exist ==

&quot;Learning Mac OS X&quot; is listed as a Maturing Text, yet it doesn't actually exist. The link should be removed from the front page.

:Fixed, although be aware that the list of books is not part of the (uneditable) main page, but an editable template included on it, which anyone can edit by clicking the &quot;edit template&quot; link below each section. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

::This is a tricky issue, IMHO.  It is best if you can somehow set up a consistant manner to start a new Wikibook, so it can be put on a bookshelf or otherwise organized and found after it has been created.  I don't see any problem at all for somebody to &quot;create&quot; a new link on the front page as a new Wikibook and then afterward go and start entering content into that Wikibook.  It would be wise in a situation like this to create an initial stub and then save it just to let people know you are serious that you really do intend to start the book, but otherwise it should be no big deal.  If a link like the one above stays &quot;red&quot; for a day or two, I don't see any reason to keep it there, however.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:36, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

=General points=
* Video [[w:DVD|DVDs]] are made up of [[w:VOB|VOB]] files which are basically packaged [[w:MPEG-2|MPEG-2]] A/V streams.
* You cannot just burn an [[w:AVI|AVI]] or a [[w:QuickTime#QuickTime_file_format|MOV]] onto a [[w:DVD|DVD]] and hope that it'll play on a [[w:DVD|DVD]] player; you need to convert the [[w:AVI|AVI]] or [[w:QuickTime#QuickTime_file_format|MOV]] to video [[w:DVD|DVD]] format first.

=Making a DVD with Premiere Pro=

==Using the Export to DVD function==

# Enter a blank DVD into your DVD drive
# Select your timeline
# Go to File &gt;  Export &gt; Export to DVD
# Select the &quot;Encoding&quot; tab on the left
# Select the Preset that you need (e.g. in the UK select PAL DV High quality 4Mb VBR two pass)
# You can edit the exact settings if you desire (for example, if you need to set it to 16:9 aspect ratio)
# Go through the remainder of the settings and ensure they are set correctly (if you're unsure then just leave them)
# Hit &quot;Record&quot;!

==Using Adobe Media Encoder==

You need to make MPEG 2 for the DVD, so you should export it out of PPro with the Adobe Media Encoder. Select the MPEG2-DVD presets and start with the &quot;PAL DV 4x3 High Quality 7Mb VBR 2 Pass SurCode for Dolby Digital 5.1&quot; preset. You get three free encodes with the SurCode encoder, so before you render this, switch to MPEG or PCM audio or if you are doing surround, you probably need to purchase the 5.1 encoder. The encoder will make the .m2v and a corresponding .wav or .mpa depending on which you select. Note, the VBR will &quot;render&quot; the file one time then it does it again. The first time, it is just looking at the file to decide where to vary the bitrate (hence the name Variable Bit Rate). So this process takes longer. If you are not concerned with saving space, you can use the CBR preset which is above the VBR preset. 

If you render an .avi with DV compression out of PPro and import it into your DVD software to encode to MPEG2, you are double compressing and it will degrade quality. 

If you render uncompressed .avi or .mov and import into DVD software and encode to MPEG2, you have a huge intermediate file to deal with.

If you plan it out properly, encoding the MPEG 2 out of PPro is the most logical thing to do for most situations. 

For example: you have a majority of video that is DV25 and put some uncompressed graphics over the top, either supers or CG stuff or whatever. When you render to DV, you get nasty compression chunks and artifacts around the edges of the text or in gradients etc.. You could retain the quality and render out of PPRO as uncompressed .avi or .mov, but that again is a huge file and the DV content does not benefit AND you still have to compress it to MPEG2. The graphics do look good, but the file is hard to work with. If you render to MPEG2 as I specify above you don't render to DV then MPEG2 (no concatenation from dual compression) and you have a decent sized file.

Note there is a bug with Hyperthreading and the Adobe Media Encoder, there is a patch from MainConcept to fix it.

The Advanced Computer Honor, like all things more than five years old and related to computing, is showing its age.  This book provides answers to all the requirements - even those that have been archaic for some time.  It is recognized that this work will itself be quickly outdated, but an attempt to update the answers has been made in this work.  

One of the goals in writing this answer book is to provide low-cost or free solutions to the problems presented.  All of the requirements requiring computer software can be met using high quality software that can be downloaded for free from the Internet.  Procedures for common commercially available software are also provided if that is available to you.  If you are going to teach this honor, you are urged to try the free packages - some of your students may not have another option.  You might be surprised at what can be done with these packages - free does not always mean cheap, and the free packages listed here have been carefully selected with quality in mind.

== 1. Have the Computer Honor ==

The answer book for the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Computer|Computer]] honor can be found in the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational|Vocational]] chapter of this book.

== 2. Define the following terms ==
=== Baud Rate ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Baud rate is a measure of the &quot;signaling rate&quot; which is the number of changes to the transmission media per second in a modulated signal. 

For Example: 250 baud means that 250 signals are transmitted in one second. If each signal carries 4 bits of information then in each second 1000 bits are transmitted. This is abbreviated as 1000 bit/s.

Baud rate should not be confused with data rate (also called &quot;bits per second&quot;). Each signaling event transmitted can carry one or more bits (as many as 256 in some cases) of information. When each signaling event transmitted carries one bit the baud rate and the data rate are equal. However, it is more common to make better use of bandwidth by encoding multiple bits in one event. This reduces the transmission time required for sending information.

=== DIP Switch ===
A DIP Switch is a component on a circuit board containing four or more switches.  Each switch can be independently closed (conducts electricity) or open (does not conduct electricity).  The &quot;DIP&quot; portion of the name is an acronym meaning &quot;Dual Inline Package&quot; and refers to the switch's packaging.  A DIP will have two rows of pins (connectors), one on each side of the device.  DIP Switches are sometimes used for configuring a circuit's mode of operation.  They were formerly in common use for setting a board's address range and selecting an interrupt line.  With the advent of newer technologies, the need for DIP switches has been greatly reduced.  It is now rare to find them on computer boards.

A database is a collection of records stored in a computer in a systematic way, such that a computer program can consult it to answer questions. For better retrieval and sorting, each record is usually organized as a set of data elements (facts). The items retrieved in answer to queries become information that can be used to make decisions that might otherwise be more difficult or impossible to make. The computer program used to manage and query a database is known as a database management system (DBMS). The properties and design of database systems are included in the study of information science.

=== Word Processing ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A word processor (also more formally known as a document preparation system) is a computer application used for the production (including composition, editing, formatting, and possibly printing) of any sort of viewable or printed material.

=== Nanosecond ===
A nanosecond is one billionth of a second.  In other words, there are a billion nanoseconds in a second.  Many computers are capable of performing billions of operations per second, and so this unit of measure is often used to describe the speed at which these operations take place.

=== DOS ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

The acronym DOS stands for disk operating system, an operating system component for computers that provides the abstraction of a file system resident on hard disk or floppy disk secondary storage. In some cases, the disk operating system was called DOS, and on the PC compatible platform, an entire family of operating systems was called DOS.

=== Internal Modem ===
The word modem stands for &quot;'''MO'''dulator/'''DEM'''odulator&quot;.  It is a device used for transmitting and receiving digital information over an analog channel.  The most common type of modem is used for transmitting and receiving digital information over a regular telephone line.  An internal modem is one which is installed inside a computer as an add-on card, or built-in to the motherboard.

=== External Modem ===
For the meaning of the word &quot;modem&quot;, see the previous entry on &quot;Internal Modem.&quot;  An external modem is usually plugged into an external serial (RS-232) port on a computer.  It comes with its own housing and power supply.  They are easier to connect than an internal modem, and often contain processing elements which offload the burden of modulation from the computer's main processor.  Internal modems can also contain such circuitry, but that is becoming less and less common, as it is cheaper to let the main processor handle these calculations.

=== Peripheral ===
A computer peripheral is a device that connects to a computer to extend the computer's capabilities.  It can be thought of as a device that sits &quot;to the side&quot; of the computer, just as peripheral vision is &quot;to the side&quot; of the eye's main vision.  Examples of peripherals include printers, keyboards, mice, monitors, modems, etc.

=== Default Disk Drive ===
Before hard drives were common and affordable, computers were often equipped with two floppy drives.  One of these - the default drive - held the operating system, and the other was used for storing user data or applications.

=== A 'K' of Memory ===
A 'K' of memory is 1024 bytes.  'K' stands for kilo, and is a shortened form of the word kilobyte.  The number 1024 is used rather than the number 1000 because 1024 is the result of multiplying two by itself ten times (that is 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2=1024).  Another way to say that number is &quot;2 raised to the 10th power, or 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. Computers are based on binary arithmetic which is a numbering system using only two digits, one and zero.  There are 1024 different ways to combine ten binary digits (more commonly called bits), so a ten-bit number can address 1024 memory locations.  Thus, the &quot;strange&quot; number of 1024.

Other important memory milestones include the megabyte (1,048,576, or 2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; bytes), the gigabyte 1,073,741,824, or 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; bytes), and the terabyte (2&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; bytes).

=== Screensaver ===
A common form of a computer monitor is the cathode ray tube, or CRT.  CRT's work by shooting electrons onto a glass screen which has been coated with a material that glows when excited by electrons.  This material can wear out if it is continually bombarded with electrons, and this in turn can cause an image to be &quot;burned in&quot; to a CRT.  A screensaver is a program that detects when the computer has been idle for a certain amount of time and then paints different images on the CRT to prevent one image from burning in.  Thus, the coating tends to wear out more evenly.  This is not unlike the concept of rotating the tires on an automobile.

Although  screensavers are not needed for newer types of monitors (such as LCD and plasma displays), they are still entertaining.  They can also be configured to put the monitor into a low-power state, saving electricity.

=== Byte ===
A byte is a collection of eight binary digits (more commonly called &quot;bits&quot;).  Although bits can only take on the values of 1 or 0 (on or off), eight of them can be combined in 256 different ways.  Thus, a byte can have one of 256 values.

=== Scanner ===
A scanner is a device that can digitize an image much as a photocopier does, except that the image is then transferred to a computer.

=== Email ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Electronic mail, abbreviated e-mail or email, is a method of composing, sending, and receiving messages over electronic communication systems. The term e-mail applies both to the Internet e-mail system based on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and to workgroup collaboration systems allowing users within one company or organization to send messages to each other. Often workgroup collaboration systems natively use non-standard protocols but have some form of gateway to allow them to send and receive internet e-mail. Some organizations may use the internet protocols for internal e-mail service.

=== Font ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A font consists of a set of images representing the characters from a particular character set in a particular typeface. Historically, fonts came in specific sizes (governing the actual height of the characters), and in sorts (governing the quantities of each letter provided).

== 3. What is the work of the following people associated with computers? ==
=== Operator ===
Computer Operators are responsible for maintaining a mainframe, server, or a network of computers.  They install software, manage user accounts, and trouble shoot the network.  They often select and install new computer equipment.  A Computer Operator generally holds an associates degree in computer science, or has related job experience.

=== Data Entry ===
Data Entry clerks are responsible for entering data into a computer and verifying that it has been entered accurately.  No job experience is necessary for a Data Entry position, but a high school diploma is often required.

=== Programmer ===
A programmer designs, writes, debugs and documents simple computer programs or small parts of large programs.  They are also often asked to debug or add functions to existing programs.  Programmers are usually required to have a bachelor's degree in computer science or previous related job experience.

=== Systems Analyst ===
Systems Analysts are responsible for designing large programs, and dividing a program into smaller programs that can be programmed by other team members, and then bringing all those pieces back together to work as a system.  In complex systems, they are also responsible for determining how much computing power is required, partitioning the problem across multiple computers, and selecting the computing components required to get the job done.  They usually need a bachelors degree in computer science plus three to five years of experience.

=== Consultant ===
A Consultant is a person who has a lot of experience, often in a specialized area of computing.  They are usually in business for themselves and work &quot;freelance&quot; for a company looking to solve a very specific problem requiring the services of an expert.  When the problem has been solved, the consultant begins working on a contract with another company.  Consultants often possess an advanced degree (Masters or PhD) and have several years of experience.

== 4. How can it be determined when a computer is reading or writing on a disk?  What precautions should be taken while the computer is performing this function? ==
Most disk drives are equipped with an indicator light that the computer will illuminate when it is accessing the drive. 
 
For a hard drive, this light is usually located on the front of the computer where it can easily be seen.  For a floppy drive, the light is located on the front of the drive itself.

A floppy disk should not be removed from a drive when it is being accessed.  The computer should not be turned off when it is accessing either a floppy drive or a hard drive.  Most modern operating systems have a &quot;shutdown&quot; function which will put the computer in a safe state before it is powered off.  When the computer is in this safe state, it will not access any of its disk drives.  Turning a computer off without running the &quot;shutdown&quot; function can result in the loss of data or corruption of the drives.

== 5. What is the difference between serial and parallel communications? ==
In serial communications, data is sent one bit at a time over a single pair of wires.  The pair of wires consists of a data line and a return line.  In parallel communications, more than one bit at a time is sent, with each bit being sent over its own wire.  Parallel bits can share a common return line or they can each have their own return line.

Examples of serial communications schemes include USB, Ethernet, and RS-232 ports.  Examples of parallel communications schemes include parallel printer ports and IDE (hard drive) interfaces.

Parallel interfaces have the obvious advantage of being much faster.  Serial interfaces have the advantage of requiring less bulky cabling and connectors.

== 6. What does it mean for a computer to be &quot;compatible?&quot; ==
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

IBM PC compatible refers to a class of computers which make up the vast majority of smaller computers on the market today. They are based (without IBM's participation) on the original IBM PC. They use the Intel x86 architecture (or an architecture made to emulate it) and are capable of using interchangeable commodity hardware. These computers also used to be referred to as PC clones, and nowadays, just PCs.

== 7. What legal responsibility applies to software with the following designation: public domain, shareware, copyright? ==
Any work that is in the public domain is free to use for any purpose whatsoever.  In the case of software, that means it can be copied freely, modified, and sold.  

Shareware is software that is distributed on a free trial basis.  After an evaluation period, the user is legally obligated to either pay for the software or uninstall it from any computer on which it was installed.

Copyright software is software that is used under an end user license agreement, or EULA.  Commercial EULAs protect the rights of the software vendor.  Other EULAs protect the rights of the user.  In general, commercial software cannot be redistributed, modified, or reverse engineered.  An example of copyright software whose EULA is designed to protect the user is &quot;open source.&quot;  Software licensed as &quot;open source&quot; can be modified, redistributed, and even sold, as long as the source code for the software and any modifications made to it are also distributed.  The right to have access to the source code is granted to the end user.  There are several open source licenses, and each is a little different.  The user of &quot;copyright&quot; software - whether commercial or open source - is legally obligated to follow whatever terms are outlined in the EULA, so it is important to read the EULA before accepting it.

== 8. Successfully using the operating system of a personal computer, do the following: ==
=== Clear the screen of the computer without turning off the power. ===
These requirements depend heavily on the operating system running on the computer being used to meet them.  This operation really only makes sense in a command-line environment (such as DOS) rather than in a graphical environment (such as Windows).  In a graphical environment, the screen could be cleared by minimizing all open windows. Instructions for a few command-line environments are given here.  At the DOS command prompt, type &quot;cls&quot; (without the quotes) and press the enter key (&quot;cls&quot; is short for &quot;clear screen&quot;).  At the Linux command prompt, enter the &quot;clear&quot; command.

=== Show the contents of a diskette on the computer screen. ===
Again, this depends on the operating system in use.  Step one is the same on all of them though - insert the diskette in the diskette drive.

: '''DOS'''
: Use the command &quot;DIR A:&quot;

: '''Linux'''
: Use a graphical file browser, or enter the following commands at the command prompt: 
 mount -t auto /dev/fd0 /media/floppy
 ls /media/floppy

: '''Macintosh'''
: Macintosh having the original GUI interface is quite simple: double click the icon for your disk at appears on the screen.  The most modern OS's from Apple are very windows like, once upon a time the icon for your disk truly appeared on the desk top when placed in the drive.

: '''Windows'''
: Open Windows Explorer (press the &quot;Windows&quot; key and the letter &quot;E&quot; at the same time).  Expand the &quot;My Computer&quot; line by clicking on the box with a + in it, then expand the &quot;Floppy (A:)&quot; line.  The contents of the disk will be displayed on the right.

=== Show how to check for bad sectors on a diskette or hard drive. ===
: '''Dos'''
: Use the following command at the DOS prompt.
 scandisk /surface

: '''Linux'''
: Use the following commands:
 umount /dev/hda1 
 fsck /dev/hda1

: '''Macintosh'''
: ???

: '''Windows XP'''
: Double click the &quot;My Computer&quot; icon.  Right click the drive you want to check and select &quot;Properties&quot;.  Then click the &quot;Tools&quot; tab followed by the &quot;Check Now&quot; button.

=== Rename a file on the disk to a different name. ===

: '''DOS'''
: Use the following command:
 ren oldname newname

: '''Linux'''
: Use the following command:
 mv oldname newname

: '''Macintosh'''
:

: '''Windows'''
: Open Windows Explorer (Windows Key + 'E') and navigate to the folder containing the file you wish to rename.  Click once on the filename.  It should become highlighted and a cursor should appear at the end of the filename.  Type the new name and press Enter.  You can also right click on the file name and select &quot;Rename&quot; from the menu.

=== Copy the contents of one disk to another in perfect &quot;mirror image.&quot; ===
This requirement seems to imply that the computer will have two floppy drives.  These days it is extremely rare to find a PC with two drives, and increasingly difficult to find one with even ''one'' floppy drive!  To meet the spirit of the requirement, you should instead be able to copy the contents of a folder onto a diskette or a flash drive. 

: '''DOS'''
: These instructions assume two floppy drives.  Insert the &quot;master&quot; diskette in the A: drive, and the destination  diskette in the B: drive.  Then use the following command:
 diskcopy [drive1:] [drive2:]
:where drive1 is the source drive and drive2 is the target.


: '''Linux'''
: These instructions assume copying a folder to a flash drive.  Insert the flash drive into the USB port and mount it to /media/usb.  Then use the following command:
  cp -ar folder/ /media/usb

: '''Macintosh'''

: '''Windows'''
: These instructions assume copying a folder to a flash drive.  Insert the flash drive into the USB port.  Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the folder containing the folder you wish to copy.  In the right panel, click on the folder you wish to copy using the mouse and drag it to the USB drive in the left panel.  Release the mouse button.

=== Show that you have completed the previous by having the computer &quot;compare&quot; the two disks and show no difference between them. ===
==== DOS ====
Use this command:
 diskcomp A: B:
Although this assumes that you have two floppy disks.  If you only have one floppy drive, try this instead:
 diskcomp A: A:
This will read the first disk and then prompt the user to insert the second disk.  The compare operation will then proceed.

==== Linux ====
To compare two directories, use the command line interface and enter this command:

 diff /path/to/source/directory /path/to/copy

Be sure to substitute the proper directories.

==== Macintosh ====
==== Windows ====
Open a DOS window and use the same procedure as described in the DOS section.

=== Show how to copy a file onto a disk. ===
: '''DOS'''
: Insert a diskette in a disk drive and use the following command:
 copy filename A:

: '''Linux'''
: Insert a diskette into the disk drive and mount it to /media/floppy.  Then use the following command:
  cp filename /media/floppy

: '''Macintosh'''
:

: '''Windows'''
: Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the destination folder.  Then navigate to the folder that has the file in it.  In the left panel, scroll to the destination folder.  Then drag the file icon in the right panel to the destination folder in the left panel.

=== Show how to delete a file from a disk. ===
: '''DOS'''
: Use the following command:
 del filename

: '''Linux'''
: Use the following command:
  rm filename

: '''Macintosh'''
:

: '''Windows'''
: Open Windows Explorer and right click on the filename.  Select &quot;Delete&quot; from the menu.

== 9. Research at least four different computer languages (such as BASIC, VISUAL BASIC, Pascal, C, C++) to find out why they were developed and for what type of application they are used.  Type a 200 word report on your findings or give a three-minute oral report. ==

The following links have plenty of material:
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_programming_language BASIC]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_basic Visual BASIC]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_programming_language Pascal]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language C]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_plus_plus C++]

Other programming languages may also be of interest:
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_programming_language Java]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_programming_language Python]

== 10. Show proficiency in the use and operation of three of the following:==
=== Word Processing ===
The word processing requirement can be met with any number of word processing programs - all of which will have different (but similar) ways of accomplishing the same thing.  The answers to this requirement have been re-organized to detail the functions for three different word processing programs:

[[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Computer Advanced/Word|Microsoft Word]]

[[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Computer Advanced/OpenOffice|OpenOffice]]

[[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Computer Advanced/WordPerfect|WordPerfect]]

=== Database &lt;br&gt;Make a list of at least 15 people, their addresses, phone number, birth date, and age.  Perform a sort function which will list the people alphabetically by last name, list by zip code, list by age, and list by birth date.  Make a printout of each list.===

=== Accounting Program ===
Do one of the following with an accounting program:
==== Perform invoice entry and bill printing of accounts receivable. ====
==== Perform invoicing and check printing of accounts payable. ====
==== Perform journal entry and financial reports of the general ledger. ====
=== Newsletter Program&lt;br&gt;Prepare three pages of double-column text with at least four different computer-generated graphics (such as graphs or clip art), two different fonts, and one headline.===

=== Spreadsheet&lt;br&gt;Show how to add columns, move columns, put a calculation in a field, save, reload, and print.  Also perform the function of adding column A and B, dividing by column C, and placing the result in column D.===

This can be accomplished with Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice Scalc, or any other spreadsheet program that is available to you and your Pathfinders.  They all work about the same, with only minor differences between them.

First you will need to start the spreadsheet program and enter in two columns of numbers.  A spreadsheet is a grid of ''cells'' arranged in rows (horizontal) and columns (vertical).  The columns are labeled by letters (Column A, B, C, etc.), and the rows are labeled by numbers (Row 1, 2, 3, etc.).  An individual cell is identified by its column and row, for example, cell B14 is in column B, row 14.  

Begin by entering three columns of numbers in columns A, B, and C.  To enter a number into a cell, simply click on the cell with the mouse and type in a number.  Then press the down arrow on the keyboard or click on another cell.  For this exercises, enter 10 numbers in each column, starting at row 1 and proceeding to row 10.

Now you are ready to add columns A and B and divide them by column C.  The results will be computed in column D.  Go to cell D1, and enter in the following:

 =(A1+B1)/C1

Be sure to start with an equal sign.  This tells the program that this column will be computed rather than taken as a literal.  After you press ''Enter'', the spreadsheet should perform the calculation, and the result should appear in cell D1.  All that remains is to copy this formula into the other 9 cells in row D.  To do this, click on cell D1 and type &lt;ctrl&gt;-C on the keyboard.  This will copy the formula into the copy buffer.  You could also right click on cell D1 with the mouse and select &quot;Copy&quot;.  Once you have done this, click on cell D2.  Then hold down the shift key and click on cell D10.  Cells D2 through D10 should be highlighted.  Then type &lt;ctrl&gt;-V (or right click and select &quot;Paste&quot;).  The program should put a copy of cell D1 into cells D2 through D10.  However, it will not put an ''exact'' copy in these cells.  Cell D2 will contain

 =(A2+B2)/C2

Note how the row numbers have changed.  This is a great convenience that will prevent you from having to edit every single entry in the column.

=== Educational Program &lt;br&gt;Teach any student in grades 1 to 4 how to successfully do a solo operation of a program designed for their age level.===

A nice, free, educational program that works on many computer operating systems is [http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/ Tux Paint].  It is available for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and other operating systems as well.  The website has plenty of documentation to get you started.

Another great program is [http://gcompris.net/ GCompris] (pronounced &quot;Gee Com-pree&quot;) and it too is available for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and more.  It offers a wide variety of activities for children of all ages, from &quot;computer discovery&quot; (how to use a mouse, etc.) to algebra.  It is available in several languages (12 as of this writing).

Alternatively, you may use one of many commercially available educational programs.

== 11. Visit the computer department of any business or have someone from a business computer department visit your classroom or club.  ==
Whether you visit company or the professional visits you, remember you are interrupting a somebody's busy schedule.  While they may genuinely happy to help you, they are doing you a favor by doing so.  Respond by showing appropriate gratitude, being polite, and being on time.
Be flexible when scheduling the visit as well.  You will need to fit your time into ''their'' schedule rather than asking them to fit their time into yours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">QBasic has two ways of making sounds.

* SOUND command
* PLAY command
==SOUND==
The SOUND command produces sound of a specific frequency for a specific duration from the PC Speaker. Only one sound can be played at a time. If multiple SOUND statements are issued sequentially, every statement after the first will not execute until after the previous one finishes.

===Syntax===
 SOUND f, d
*f - Frequency in Hertz
*d - Duration in ticks

===Example===
 SOUND 1000 , 20

Plays a 1000 hertz wave for 20 ticks. One second is about 18.2 ticks, so 20 ticks are about 1.1 seconds.

The lowest frequency allowed by QBasic is 37 Hz, which is roughly a D in the 2nd octave.  
The highest frequency is 32 767 Hz, but this tone can not be heard, because the normal human hearing range ends at 20 000 Hz.

A secondary function of the SOUND command is to use it to control time in a program.

    For x% = 1 TO 10
     Print x%
     Sound 32000,18.2
    NEXT

This program will print the numbers 1 to 10, with a 1 second delay between each number.

==PLAY==
The PLAY command is for playing music.  It can only play one note at a time.

More than that the play command can play a complex stored &quot;song&quot;  This is accomplished through the use of a song string. For string command detail, see [[QBasic/Appendix#PLAY]].

There are no prospective randomized trials evaluating efficacy of adjuvant RT. Single institution retrospective studies seem to suggest some benefit to RT, particularly with higher doses (&gt;45 Gy) and with microscopically positive margins (R1). The role of brachytherapy is similarly unclear.


==RT==
===Intrahepatic (peripheral)===
*'''Chang Gung Taiwan 1977-2001''' PMID 15793863 -- ''Prognostic analysis of surgical treatment of peripheral cholangiocarcinoma: two decades of experience at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.'' ('''2005 Jan''' YY, World J Gastroenterol. 2005 Mar 28;11(12):1779-84.)
**Retrospective. 373 patients with peripheral CCA (second order or more intrahepatic branches), 50% hepatectomy (36% curative resection). Please see more detail in surgical section
**RT 63 patients vs. no RT 249 (not further discussed in text)
**Median survival, 3-year OS, 5-year OS: RT 11.7 mo (16.6%, 6.6%) vs. no RT 6.2 mo (9.6%, 7.2%) p=0.02
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Favorable overall survival of PCC patients undergoing surgical treatment depends on early tumor stage, presence of mucobilia, papillary tumor type, hepatic resection, and post-operative chemotherapy&quot;

*'''Paris VII France 1990-97''' PMID 10398898 -- ''Resection of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a Western experience.'' ('''1999 Valverde''' A, J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg. 1999;6(2):122-7.)
**Retrospective. 42 patients, 30 curative resection
**Median survival: 28 months, 3 survivors &gt; 5 years
**Adjuvant RT and/or CT had no impact on survival
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Complete surgical resection may offer a chance for long-term survival in selected patients and may improve the quality of life of patients with more advanced disease.&quot;

===Perihilar===
*'''UT MD Anderson 1984-2005''' PMID 18754070 -- ''[Extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma: patients at high-risk for local recurrence treated with surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation have an equivalent overall survival to patients with standard-risk treated with surgery alone]'' ('''2008 Borghero,Y'''. 2008 Ann Surg Oncol Jul 15(11):3147-56.)
**Retrospective. 65 patients. Two groups compared, Surgery only n=23(had R0 and N0) and Surgery + Adjuvant CRT n=42 (had R1 and/or R1)
**Median (5-year) OS-5: S vs S-CRT 36% vs 42% p=NS LRR-5: 38% vs. 37%, P = .13
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our finding of a lack of a survival difference between the S and S-CRT groups suggests that for patients with extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma at high risk for locoregional recurrence (i.e., R1 resection or pN1 disease), adjuvant chemoradiation provides an equivalent overall survival despite of these worse prognostic features.&quot;

**Retrospective. 198 patients treated, 61% resected, 30% radical resection. Some treated with post-op RT (unclear)
**Post-op RT significant predictor of post-op survival (no numbers in abstract)

*'''Jefferson 1983-97''' PMID 15685030 -- ''Positive microscopic margins alter outcome in lymph node-negative cholangiocarcinoma when resection is combined with adjuvant radiotherapy.'' ('''2005 Stein''' DE, Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Feb;28(1):21-3.
**Retrospective. 16 patients treated post-op with RT (7 negative surgical margin, 9 positive surgical margin), average dose 53 Gy via both EBRT and BT; median follow-up 55 months
**Median (5-year) OS: margin (-) 21.5 months (18.4%) vs. margin (+) 26 months (15%), p=NS
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Positive microscopic margins in lymph node-negative, resected hilar cholangiocarcinoma may not represent a negative prognostic factor when resection is combined with postoperative radiotherapy in this cohort.&quot;

*'''Miami 1985-97''' PMID 11677948 -- ''Management of hilar bile duct carcinoma.'' ('''2001 Bathe''' OF, Hepatogastroenterology. 2001 Sep-Oct;48(41):1289-94.)
**Retrospective. 55 patients, 19 curative resection.
**2-year survival longer in resection 47% vs. 18% (p=0.03)
**No benefit to RT (either postoperative RT or in unresectable disease)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Locoregional extent of disease is the greatest problem in cases of proximal bile duct cancers. Resection provides the best hope for long-term survival, but new adjuvant strategies are needed.&quot;

*'''Tsukuba Japan''' PMID 10701737 -- ''Benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy after radical resection of locally advanced main hepatic duct carcinoma.'' ('''2000 Todoroki''' T, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Feb 1;46(3):581-7.)
**Retrospective. 63 pts with Klatskin IVA (T4, N0-1, M0) treated by radical resection.
**47 pts had microscopic + margins (R1). 28 of those received XRT (17 IORT + postop RT; 6 IORT only; 4 postop only)), 19 surgery only.
**5-year OS: surgery 13.5% vs. RT 33.9% (IORT + EBRT 39.2%). 
**Locoregional control: surgery 31.2% vs. RT 79.2%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our data clearly suggest the improved prognosis of patients with locally advanced Klatskin tumor by integrated adjuvant radiotherapy with IORT and PORT to complete gross tumor resection with acceptable treatment mortality and morbidity.&quot;

*'''Amsterdam Netherlands''' PMID 9841770 -- ''Long-term survival after resection of proximal bile duct carcinoma (Klatskin tumors).'' ('''1999 Gerhards''' MF, World J Surg. 1999 Jan;23(1):91-6.)
**Retrospective. 12/79 surgically treated patients with &gt;5 year survival evaluated
**No correlation with RT
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Preoperative Bismuth classification of the tumor, absence of multifocality, diploid-type tumors, and negative proximal bile duct margins at histopathologic examination were the only significant prognostic factors for long-term survival&quot;

*'''Hopkins 1988-93''' PMID 7794082 -- ''Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Postoperative radiotherapy does not improve survival.'' ('''1995 Pitt''' HA, Ann Surg. 1995 Jun;221(6):788-97; discussion 797-8.)
**Prospective. 50 Pts w/ perihillar CA. Stratified by surgery (31 radical vs. 19 palliative) and RT (23 RT vs. 27 no RT)
**Resection improved the length (24.2 vs. 11.3 months, p &lt; 0.05) and quality of survival. 
**Radiation had *no* effect on the length (18.4 vs. 20.1 months) or quality of survival or on late toxicity.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This analysis suggests that in patients with localized perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, resection prolongs survival whereas radiation has no effect on either survival or late toxicity.&quot;
**Study insufficient to rule out post-op RT benefit in patients with complete surgical resection

*'''Amsterdam''' PMID 1648329 -- ''Does additive radiotherapy after hilar resection improve survival of cholangiocarcinoma? An analysis in sixty-four patients.'' ('''1991 Verbeek''' PC, Ann Chir. 1991;45(4):350-4.)
**Retrospective. 64 pts with Klatskin tumors, all had surgery. 29 post-op XRT, 22 resection only, and 13 postoperative deaths. 
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: Overall survival benefit for XRT (p&lt;0.001)

*'''Hopkins''' PMID 1688486 -- ''Management of proximal cholangiocarcinomas by surgical resection and radiotherapy.'' ('''1990 Cameron''' JL, Am J Surg 1990; 159:91-7; discussion 97-8.)
**Retrospective. 96 patients, 55% resected (41% curative resection), 45% palliative stenting. 
**5-year OS: resected 8% vs. stented 0%
**RT given as EBRT 50-60Gy + some patients BT 2Gy boost: Adjuvant RT 72% (38/53), 51% BT boost;, palliative RT 58% (25/43), 10% BT boost
***Adjuvant RT: 3-year OS 31% both groups (p=NS), but all long term survivors received RT
***Palliative RT: 1-year OS 38% RT vs 9% no RT (p&lt;0.05)
***RT significantly extended survival in patients undergoing palliative stenting, but not in those undergoing resection.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;We conclude that surgical resection of proximal cholangiocarcinomas can be performed safely and that it significantly prolongs survival.&quot;

===Distal bile duct===
*'''Shanghai China 1996-2002''' PMID 15196364 -- ''[Prognostic analysis of patients suffering from distal bile duct cancer] - [Article in Chinese]'' ('''2004 Sun''' LC, Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi. 2004 May 7;42(9):528-31.)
**Retrospective. 173 of distal bile duct CA. 
**Significant impact: surgical procedure, LN mets, and pathological grade
**No impact: transfusion, invasion of pancreas, postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy, ERCP, diameter of tumour, serum level of CA-19-9, preoperative total serum bilirubin level (TBIL), ratio of albumin to globulin (A/G), sex and age
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Radical resection is only curative treatment modality. Aggressive treatment and prevention on postoperative liver metastasis is a important strategy to improve the survival for distal bile duct cancer.&quot;

*'''Tsukuba Japan''' PMID 11260100 -- ''Treatment strategy for patients with middle and lower third bile duct cancer.'' ('''2001 Todoroki''' T, Br J Surg. 2001 Mar;88(3):364-70.)
**67 patients with middle/lower BDCA
**5-year OS: 63% R0 vs. 16% R1 vs. 0% R2 vs. 0% no resection. R2 median survival longer (11.4 months) then no resection (3.5 months)
**RT improved 5-year OS in R1 patients (8% vs. 0%) but p=NS 
**R0 relapse: 1 locoregional, 6 distant mets, 5 both. Liver most frequent mets
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Curative (R0) resection is only one step in curing cancer, and radiotherapy may play a beneficial role in controlling locoregional residual tumour.&quot;

===Any location===
*'''Pittsburgh 1983-97''' PMID 12902899 -- ''Cholangiocarcinoma: the impact of tumor location and treatment strategy on outcome.'' ('''2003 Heron''', Am J Clin Oncol. 2003 Aug;26(4):422-8.)
**Retrospective. 118 patients, treated with surgery, RT (EBRT or ILRT), surgery + RT, chemo, palliation, and combinations
**Mean survival: overall 22 months, proximal tumors 17 months vs. distal tumors 47 months
**Improved survival for surgery + RT vs surgery alone for proximal and distal lesions.
**Poor prognosis (3.5 months) for palliation only.

*'''Florida 1962-93''' PMID 9822171 -- ''Carcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary tract: surgery and radiotherapy for curative and palliative intent.'' ('''1998 Zlotecki''' RA, Radiat Oncol Investig 1998; 6:240-7.)
**Retrospective. 47 patients, 17 surgery alone, 20 surgery + EBRT, 10 EBRT alone
**5-year OS: 15%, surgery alone 15% vs. surgery + EBRT or EBRT alone 14%
**5-year OS: gross total resection alone 19% vs. gross total resection + EBRT 35% (p=0.07)
**Median survival after EBRT alone: 6.4 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot; Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy was well tolerated and may improve local-regional control after gross total resection.&quot;

*'''Hopkins 1971-94''' PMID 8857851 -- ''Cholangiocarcinoma. A spectrum of intrahepatic, perihilar, and distal tumors.'' ('''1996 Nakeeb''' A, Ann Surg. 1996 Oct;224(4):463-73; discussion 473-5.)
**Retrospective. 294 patients, 6% intrahepatic, 67% perihilar, 27% distal tumors
**Resectability rate: 50% intrahepatic, 56% perihilar, 91% distal
**Median survival (5-year survival): intrahepatic 26 months (44%), perihilar 19 months (11%), and distal 22 months (28%)
**Post-op RT did not improve survival
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Cholangiocarcinoma is best classified into three broad categories. Resection remains the primary treatment, whereas postoperative adjuvant radiation has no influence on survival.&quot;

*'''Jefferson 1983-1992''' PMID 7480704 -- ''Cholangiocarcinoma: clinical significance of tumor location along the extrahepatic bile duct.'' ('''1995 Alden''' ME, Radiology. 1995 Nov;197(2):511-6.)
**Retrospective. 81 pts, 56 proximal, 25 distal. Median follow-up 28 months
**5-year OS: proximal 13% vs. distal 53% (p&lt;0.01)
**Proximal CA (RT or resection + RT or palliation): median survival no RT 6 mo vs. RT 17 mo (p=0.01). No benefit for resection in presence of RT
**Distal CA (resection +/- RT): no benefit for RT after resection
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Patients with proximal cancer should undergo primary RT, and expectations should be limited. Patients with distal cancer should undergo resection, and RT may not be needed.&quot;

*'''UCSF 1977-1987''' PMID 8147607 -- ''Carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts. The University of California at San Francisco experience.'' ('''1994 Schoenthaler''' R, Ann Surg 1994; 219:267-74.)
**Retrospective. 129 patients, min 5 year follow-up. 48% surgery alone, 35% surgery + RT, 17% charged particles (helium/neon)
**Median survival: entire group 6.5/11/14 months, curative intent 16/16/23 months
**Patients with microscopic residual disease had increased median survival times when they were treated with adjuvant RT, most markedly after CP (p = 0.0005) but also with conventional XRT (p = 0.0109). 
**Patients with gross residual disease had a less marked but still statistically significant extended survival (p = 0.05 for S + X and p = 0.0423 for S + CP) after RT
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The mainstay of bile duct carcinoma management was maximal surgical resection in these patients. Postoperative radiotherapy gave patients with positive microscopic margins a significant survival advantage and may be of value in selected patients with gross disease.&quot;

*'''Wash U''' PMID 8159005 -- ''Multidisciplinary treatment of biliary tract cancers.'' ('''1994 Kraybill''' WG, J Surg Oncol 1994; 55:239-45.)
**Retrospective. 96 patients with GB or with biliary duct CA. Median survival 11 months
**Resection significantly (p=0.02) improved survival
**RT &gt; 40Gy significantly (p=0.003) improved survival

**96 patients resection or stenting, 66% received RT (49.6-72.2Gy)
**7 patients developed gastric/duodenal obstruction, after evaluation presumed radiation fibrosis
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our experience suggests that radiation therapy increases the risk of postoperative gastric and duodenal obstruction in patients undergoing surgery for cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

**Retrospective. 63 (55 EHBD, 8 GB) patients treated with RT. 12 liver transplant, 13 chemo, 3 BT alone, 9 EBRT + BT
**Median survival: 7 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Extrahepatic biliary duct cancers, the absence of metastases, increasing calendar year of treatment, and liver transplantation with postoperative radiation therapy were factors significantly associated with improved survival.&quot;

**Retrospective. 42 patients (11 microscopic positive margins after surgery, 31 unresectable) given EBRT + ILRT
**Median survival 10 months

==Brachytherapy==

**Retrospective. 69 patients, 30 surgery alone vs. 39 surgery + adjuvant RT. Similar features in both groups.
**RT treatment: 31 EBRT (mean 37.2 Gy) + BT (mean 36.9 Gy) vs. 8 EBRT only (mean 37.5 Gy)
**3-year survival: surgery + RT 41% vs. surgery alone 33% (p=NS)
**Subgroup analysis (by surgical margin, stage) no benefit to RT, except adjuvant RT with pStage III/IVa (p=0.04)
**2 complications: stenosis of bile duct, venous bleeding from ostomy
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Radiation therapy after surgery did not show any clinical benefits for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. However, it may be effective as adjuvant therapy after curative resection in a small subgroup of patients with p-stage III or IVa disease.&quot;

**Retrospective. 112 patients underwent resection, 91 survived post-op. No RT in 20 patients,  EBRT in 30 patients (median 46 Gy), 41 patients EBRT (median 42 Gy) + ILRT (median 10 Gy)
**88% late complications; significantly more with RT
**Median survival: surgery only 8 months vs. surgery + RT 24 months, but no add'l benefit to ILRT
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Additional radiotherapy after resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma significantly improved survival and is recommended by giving external beam irradiation but not intraluminal brachytherapy.&quot;

**Retrospective. 109 patients received RT, 71 patients surgery + preop RT (19) or + post-op RT (52). Of these, 41 received 10 Gy ILRT boost. Median dose 50-55 Gy. 38 patients palliative RT, 19 received 22-25 ILRT Gy boost. Median dose 60-68 Gy.
**Median survival: surgery + RT 24 months vs. palliative 10.4 months
**Surgical patients: dose &gt; 55 Gy had *lower* survival, and no benefit to brachytherapy
**Palliative patients: no benefit to brachytherapy
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The role of radiotherapy either as adjuvant or as primary treatment remains to be demonstrated in prospective randomised studies. From our results, it seems that high radiation doses could be dangerous and could detriment prognosis. Brachytherapy boost was not superior to treatment with external beam irradiation alone.&quot;

**Prospective. 38 patients, various types of surgical treatment. Hyperfractionation schedule: 20 patients EBRT (6 patients 22.5 Gy 2.25 Gy/fx BID, 12 patients 45 Gy 2.25 Gy/fx BID, 1 patient EBRT 30 Gy conventional, 1 patient EBRT 50 Gy conventional). 14 patients EBRT (median 24 Gy) + BT (40 Gy). 4 patients BT alone (45 Gy @ 1cm)
**Toxicity: 1 patient acute Grade 3, 2 patients late GIB
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Accelerated external beam radiotherapy with or without intraluminal radiotherapy is feasible and associated with acceptable toxicity when used in the management of advance cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

**Retrospective. 62 patients, 77% treated post resection (62% XRT 54 Gy, 38% charged particles 60 Gy)
**Median survival (2-year OS): 12 months photons (18%) vs. 23 months particles (44%) p=0.048
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Compared to conventional photon radiotherapy, treatment with post-operative charged particle irradiation at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory appeared to offer a survival advantage in this non-randomized series.&quot;

== Overview ==

'''''Bane''''' is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]] living in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is serving his detention in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], they are startled by the appearance of a centaur, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ronan|Ronan]], who makes some comments about astronomy (&quot;Mars is bright tonight&quot;). Shortly, Bane joins them, and makes similar comments about astronomy.

After leaving them, Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], and Hagrid's boar-hound Fang find the creature that has been killing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorns]]. As the creature seems to be about ready to attack Harry, he is rescued by another Centaur, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]], who offers to carry Harry back to Hagrid. As he is doing so, he is met by Bane and Ronan, who accuse him of becoming a pack animal for humans, like a donkey, and interfering with the portents. Firenze leaves them behind, saying that he will fight the evil, even alongside humans if he must.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Firenze, now teaching Divination, explains that he cannot return to the Forbidden Forest, as he has been banished by his herd. Harry sees a hoof-shaped bruise on his chest, and wonders if it was Bane who put that there.

Bane, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Magorian|Magorian]], is in the group of centaurs who confront Hagrid as he is taking Harry and Hermione back to the school after introducing them to his half-brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]]. Bane makes no sign of having spoken to Harry earlier, but warns &quot;this human&quot; Hagrid what will happen to him if he returns to the Forest.

Bane is among the group of centaurs who come to investigate when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is leading Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] into the Forbidden Forest to try and entrap her there. After Umbridge has insulted the Centaurs by calling them &quot;inferior half-breeds&quot; and has magically bound Magorian, the centaurs swarm her, and the last we see of Umbridge is Bane bearing her off into the forest.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When Hagrid is carrying an apparently-dead Harry out of the Forbidden Forest, apparently several centaurs are present and watching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s victory procession. Hagrid calls out to Bane, apparently believing that their inaction implicates them in Harry's death.

Whether or not Hagrid's accusations of Bane have effect is uncertain; Bane, however, is one of the centaurs who lead the counter attack on the Death Eaters, along with Ronan and Magorian.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

In his own way, Bane is as prejudiced as any Death Eater. He believes in the innate superiority of Centaurs over humans, and is affronted by any suggestion that humans and centaurs could work together. In this he is only echoing the beliefs of his herd, beliefs that are apparently shared to a greater or lesser degree by every centaur we meet.

      <comment>[[Talk:XML: Managing Data Exchange/The many-to-many relationship]] moved to [[Talk:XML - Managing Data Exchange/The many-to-many relationship]]: Following main page; colons are archaic in book titles and interfere with proper function of templates.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There appears to be an error in the example used in this page. One of the code listings is supposed to be an XSLT stylesheet but (I believe this is by error) the XML instance document (source of the transformation) is repeated instead. I'd like to see the XSLT document referenced in the discussion.

Also, Line numbers are referred to in the text but don't appear in the examples.

I tried to locate contact information to report these editing oversites, but couldn't locate any. Hopefully this submission will be forwarded to someone who can report the erros.

Cheers,

== Chapter Revision Suggestions ==

proposed by Christina Serrano 1/29/06

The following two suggestions are intended to focus the chapter on the many-to-many concept. These additional sections add confusion and inconsistency to the chapter. Moreover, these sections are not specific to the many-to-many relationship and can be applied to other XML chapters, so it would make sense to place these sections in separate resource chapters.
* Remove the section on xslt numeric functions--this information could be placed in a chapter about xslt.
* Remove the section on additional data types for xml schemas--this information could be placed in a chapter about xml schemas.

The following are suggestions to improve the many-to-many sections:
* After the intro, explain the problems inherent in representing many-to-many relationships in XML.
* Show examples of each proposed solution to remedy the many-to-many problem.
* Apply formatting changes outlined in the author guidelines.
* Edit for spelling, grammar, and sentence structure.

==Professor's comments==
The m:m example needs to be redone to give a more complete coverage of the problem. Refer to http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-xdm2m.html.
We need to cover the first two cases and explain the ID and IDREF datataypes. Also, I think we just focus on a part of the data model. The suggested version follows.

[[Image:XML_Hotel_amenity.png]]

Also, to use a stylesheet with an m:m, the key function needs to be introduced.

==Post-revision Comments==

Christina Serrano 2/23/06

I'm still not too clear on how to explain the key function. I've added a short paragraph about it, but I wasn't sure how detailed I should go in this chapter. I used the following resource: http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#key. This page contains more comprehensive information regarding the key function, so I can add more to this chapter--or would it be more appropriate to add this information to the XSLT chapter?</text>

= Open Sicilian =
Whites pawn is under attack from the knight on f6. He must defend it or forestall Blacks capture of it in some way. [[/5. Nc3/]] is almost universally played as it is the knight's natural square anyway. A knight on c3 increases Whites influence of the d5 square,  and forms a defensive bulwark against attacks on the c-file, to the extent that Black will often give up a rook to remove it. 

Also played is [[/5. f3/]]. At first glance White is attempting to reserve the option of moving the c-pawn to c4. However there is not usually time for this, because without a White knight on c3 Black is immediately threatening to play e5 and d5 and equalise in the centre. White is compelled to throw a spanner in the works, usually with Bb5+, and c4 gets forgotten in the ensuing complications. 

[[/5. Bb5/]]+ is plausible and may transpose into common lines, but if Whites plan is to simplify this way, why now and not two moves previously when White could have followed up by castling kingside with a useful defensive knight on f3? Bb5+ is a shade inconsistent.

[[/5. Bd3/]] commits the bishop to a square on which it will have no future after the obvious e5. It also fails to prevent a subsequent d5.

== Series RLC Circuit ==
[[Image:RLC series circuit.png|thumbnail|200px]]
===Second Order Differential Equation===
:&lt;math&gt;L \frac{dI}{dt} + I R + \frac{1}{C} \int I dt = V&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} + \frac{R}{L} \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{I}{LC}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The characteristic equation is
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 + \frac{R}{L}s + \frac{1}{LC}   = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s = -\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}&lt;/math&gt;


Where 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{R}{2L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}\sqrt{LC}&lt;/math&gt;




When &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \alpha^2 = \beta^2 ; R = 2 \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;
: The equation only has one real root . &lt;math&gt;s = -\alpha = - \frac{R}{2L}&lt;/math&gt;
: The solution for &lt;math&gt;I(t) = A e^(-\frac{R}{2L} t)&lt;/math&gt;
: The I - t curve would look like



When &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 &gt; \beta^2&lt;/math&gt; . R &gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;
: The equation only has two real root . &lt;math&gt;s = -\alpha &lt;/math&gt; ± &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}&lt;/math&gt;
: The solution for &lt;math&gt;I(t) = e^{- \alpha + \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2} t} + e^{- \alpha - \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2} t} = e^{-\alpha} e^{j(\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2})} + e^{-j(\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2})}&lt;/math&gt; 
: The I - t curve would look like



When &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 &lt; \beta^2&lt;/math&gt; . R &lt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;
: The equation has two complex  root . &lt;math&gt;s = -\alpha &lt;/math&gt; ± j&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt;
: The solution for &lt;math&gt;I(t) = e^{(- \alpha + \sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2} t)} + e^{(- \alpha - \sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2} t)} = e^{-\alpha}  e^{j(\sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2})} + e^{-j(\sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2})}&lt;/math&gt; 
: The I - t curve would look like

=== Damping Factor ===

The damping factor is the amount by which the oscillations of a circuit gradually decrease over time. We define the damping ratio to be:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=50%
!Circuit Type!!Series RLC !! Parallel RLC
|-
|Damping Factor || &lt;math&gt;\zeta = {R \over 2L}&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\zeta = {1 \over 2RC}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Resonance Frequency || &lt;math&gt;\omega_o = {1 \over \sqrt{L C}}&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\omega_o = {1 \over \sqrt{L C}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Compare The Damping factor with The Resonance Frequency give rise to different types of circuits: '''Overdamped''', '''Underdamped''', and '''Critically Damped'''.

=== Bandwidth ===

{{eqn|Bandwidth}}
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \omega  =  2 \zeta &lt;/math&gt;

For series RLC circuit:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \omega  =  2 \zeta   = { R \over L}&lt;/math&gt;

For Parallel RLC circuit:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \omega  =  2 \zeta   = { 1 \over RC}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Quality Factor ===
{{eqn|Quality Factor}}
:&lt;math&gt;Q =   {\omega_o \over \Delta \omega } = {\omega_o \over 2\zeta }&lt;/math&gt;

For Series RLC circuit:

:&lt;math&gt;Q =   {\omega_o \over \Delta \omega } = {\omega_o \over 2\zeta } = {L \over R \sqrt{LC}} = {1 \over R} \sqrt{L \over C}&lt;/math&gt;

For Parallel RLC circuit:

:&lt;math&gt;Q =   {\omega_o \over \Delta \omega } = {\omega_o \over 2\zeta } = {RC \over \sqrt{LC}} = {R} \sqrt{C \over L}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stability ===

Because inductors and capacitors act differently to different inputs, there is some potential for the circuit response to approach infinity when subjected to certain types and amplitudes of inputs. When the output of a circuit approaches infinity, the circuit is said to be '''unstable'''. Unstable circuits can actually be dangerous, as unstable elements overheat, and potentially rupture.

A circuit is considered to be stable when a &quot;well-behaved&quot; input produces a &quot;well-behaved&quot; output response. We use the term &quot;Well-Behaved&quot; differently for each application, but generally, we mean &quot;Well-Behaved&quot; to mean a finite and controllable quantity.

==Resonance ==
===With R = 0===

When R = 0 , the circuit reduces to a series LC circuit. When the circuit is in resonance, the circuit will vibrate at the resonant frequency.

: &lt;math&gt;Z_L = Z_C&lt;/math&gt;  
: &lt;math&gt;\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

''The circuit vibrates and has the capability of producing a Standing Wave when R = 0 , L = C''

===With R ≠ 0===
When R ≠ 0 and the circuit operates in resonance . 
: The frequency dependent components L , C cancel out ie Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; - Z&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 so that the total impedance of the circuit is &lt;math&gt;Z_R + Z_L + Z_C = R + [ Z_L - Z_C ] = R + 0 = R&lt;/math&gt;
: The current of the circuit is &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
: The Operating Frequency is &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

If the current is halved by doubling the value of resistance then
: &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{2R}&lt;/math&gt;
: Circuit will be stable over the range of frquencies from &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 - \omega_2&lt;/math&gt;

''The circuit has the capability to select bandwidth where the circuit is stable '' . Therefore, it is best suited for Tuned Resonance Select Bandwidth Filter

Once using L or C to tune circuit into resonance at resonance frequency &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;'' The current is at its maximum value &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt; . Reduce current above &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{2R}&lt;/math&gt; circuit will respond to narrower bandwidth than &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 - \omega_2&lt;/math&gt;. Reduce current below &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{2R}&lt;/math&gt; circuit will respond to wider bandwidth than &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 - \omega_2&lt;/math&gt;.

This handbook is intended for educators who teach English (including written and oral language), or who teach subjects that require English language proficiency. Standards for teaching and learning [[w:English_language|English language]] can be organized from a variety of perspectives. Headings and subheadings in this Wiki book should represent that variety. Contributors are welcome to add samples of text and media along with their contributions. Because this Wiki is available worldwide, the standards can and should reflect the global uses of English. Click the &quot;Edit&quot; links below to work on this Wiki. General help on writing in Wiki, including 'how to' sheets, can be found at [[w:Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page|Wikipedia]]. Specific information on how to make the wiki do what you want with codes is at [[m:Help:Editing|Meta]]. When headings and subheadings begin to become too bulky for a single page, new pages will be created.

== History ==
The ''Curriculum and Evaluation Standards'', published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) in 1989, set in motion a mandate for other content organizations to write standards. The Standards Project for the English Language Arts (SPELA) was funded by the federal government of the USA in 1992 to write the standards. In 1994, the United States Department of Education discontinued funding of the project, ostensibly because of the theoretical pluralism informing the work. The standards that were eventually [http://www.ncte.org/about/over/standards/110846.htm published] are general, typically avoiding clear performance benchmarks. Nevertheless, they offer an implicit view of the variety in theoretical perspectives that were brought to bear on the task. 

Standards for Language may be difficult to write because of the breadth of the subject. Language is considered to be a primary medium for human thinking ([[w:Vygotsky|Vygotsky]]). As such, to attempt to write standards for Language is similar to writing standards for how to think. Language is not necessarily one discipline or subject, but includes all the breadth of thinking, speaking, and writing in many disciplines which have written their own standards already ([http://standards.nctm.org/document/ Mathematics], [http://www.socialstudies.org/standards/ Social Studies], [http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses/html/ Sciences]). 

While all disciplines and content rely on language for thinking and communication, the primary school subject standards documents do not articulate standards for integrating the language necessary for their specific subjects: [http://www.nctm.org/standards/overview.htm Mathematics],  [[w:National_Science_Education_Standards|Science]],  [http://www.socialstudies.org/standards/ Social Studies]. Interestingly, although Literature is one of the main curricular incarnations of the English Language in schooling, only a few organizations are attempting to narrow the task of writing English Language standards by focusing their efforts on  [http://web.cocc.edu/humanities/standards/eng_lit.htm Literature]. (Also notable is the fact that many of the organizations that set standards offer access to them only for those who pay.)

A variety of organizations have worked on English Language standards, and a section is dedicated to these organizations at the bottom of this wiki page.

A short history of education standards has also been compiled by [http://www.mcrel.org/standards-benchmarks/docs/history.asp McREL].

== Standards and Accountability ==
Standards for curriculum and instruction may define the work of educators and students. 
In the United States of America, individual states have written standards, and have often passed legislation to enact these standards in public schools and institutions of higher education. State to state (and nation to nation) the standards can look very different. For example, a state's standards may have been written before the research on &quot;phonemic awareness&quot; had gained its prominence. What is the result of variety in standards based on political boundaries?

Among the major standards that have already been written for English, each major heading seems to be informed by a particular theoretical approach to language. In the Wiki Standards, we can allow these approaches to be named and elaborated on. As commonalities begin to appear across categories, internal and external links can be used to emphasize the commonalities among theoretical approaches. 

==Media-based Standards==
One approach to writing standards is to begin from the types of performance we expect or hope to see around certain kinds of media, such as print and speech.

===Reading and Writing===
Reading in English is based on an understanding of the English alphabetic principle, which is different from other principles of print, and unique among languages that use alphabets. In order to master the English alphabetic principle, readers and writers need to: 
====Demonstrate awareness of spoken English phonology, including====

=====Word Awareness=====
This is the knowledge that individual words are represented in speech and print. In English print, word awareness involves knowledge of conventional visual spacing between words. In speech, word awareness involves a tacit knowledge of individual spoken words. In Linguistics, word awareness corresponds to the concept of the &quot;[lexeme].&quot; Without comparison to print, there has been some argument that people's concept of a 'word' is difficult to define. For example, [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/LORSIY.html Albert Lord] found that non-literate storytellers often considered the term 'verbatim' to refer to preservation of the main structure in an oral performance of a tale, not really a word-for-word match from performance to performance.

=====Word Awareness Performance=====
Demonstrate word awareness by 
*touching the head and arm joints in order toward the fingers to represent each word being spoken.
*pointing to individual words in print. 
*substituting one word for another in speech or writing.
*writing words with conventional spacing. 
*cutting or folding strips of written words into individual words.

=====Phonemic Awareness=====
Phonemic awareness is a demonstration that shows either tacit or explicit knowledge of the individual [[w:Phoneme|phonemes]] of the English language. Phonemes are sounds that can make a difference in meanings. In Linguistics, the concept of the phoneme is demonstrated by [[w:Minimal_pairs|minimal pairs]]. Research on reading success suggests that the demonstrations of phonemic awareness most likely to predict reading success are: a. segmenting words into individual phonemes (i.e., student is asked to segment the word &quot;skip&quot; and the response is, /s/ /k/ /i/ /p/), and b. blending strings of correctly sequenced phonemes into words (i.e., student is given the phonemes /b/ /l/ /o/ distinctly and in order, and student responds by saying &quot;blow&quot;). Phonemic awareness may be demonstrated and practiced with no printed language present, but research suggests that phonemic awareness instruction has a greater effect on reading success when practiced with written examples. A summary of the research can be found in the booklet [http://www.nifl.gov/partnershipforreading/publications/reading_first1.html#phonemic Put Reading First], published by the US federally sponsored [http://www.nifl.gov/partnershipforreading/ Partnership for Reading].

=====Phonemic Awareness Performance=====
Demonstrate phonemic awareness by: 
*segmenting individual words into distinct phonemes. 
*counting the phonemes in a word. 
*blending a sequence of individual phonemes into a whole word. 
*substituting phonemes into a word to make a different word or nonsense word. 
*identifying which phonemes come first or last in a word

=====Syllable Awareness=====

=====Onset and Rime Awareness=====

===Speaking and Listening===

==Power-based standards==
One approach to writing standards is to begin by considering the ways language mediates power among those who use it. This approach is largely absent from state-sponsored standards. Power in language is often informed by students of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory Critical Theory] and [[w:Critical_pedagogy|Critical Pedagogy]].The standards movement itself may come under question through an examination of power, because standards imply agreement with those who hold influence. But we might consider 'standards' as being similar to the hopes and goals of people who think systematically about power in language education. Moreover, those who think about power in language education will usually put forward 'tools for thinking' that they hope other people will use.

==Content standards==
One approach to writing standards is to categorize them based on the unique ways language is involved with specific content. In particular, students in academic disciplines and school subjects have developed specific ways to use language for thinking about and organizing their content. Each discipline or content domain may wish to specify what is expected for language for that domain. So, while the NCTM articulated curriculum and evaluation standards for mathematics content, they did not articulate the ways language is conventionally used to mediate the content in English. 

==Thinking-based standards==
One approach to writing standards is to begin from the kinds of thinking we expect or hope the language will mediate for the users of the language. 

===Bloom's Taxonomy===
[[w:Bloom's_taxonomy|Bloom's taxonomy]] of thinking is a way of classifying objectives for thinking. Because language can be described as a medium for thinking, language standards could emerge from different classes of thought.

==Genre-based standards==
One approach to writing standards is to begin by differentiating genres, or types, of language use. This approach can be informed by the work of those working in [[w:Genre_studies|Genre Studies]].

==Structure-based standards==
One approach to writing standards is to work from knowledge of language structures and structural systems, such as phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. This approach is strongly informed by studies in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics Linguistics].

==ESL and TESOL approaches==
One approach to writing standards is to begin by considering that English may not be the student's primary language. This perspective can be informed by students of [[w:Language_acquisition|Language Acquisition]].

==Performance-based approaches==
One approach to writing standards is to outline specific performances or tasks (benchmarks) and to work toward larger categories as performances begin to show common characteristics.

      <comment>/* Why Transform Circuits? */ putting space in &quot;blackbox&quot; so reads &quot;black box&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Circuit Theory/Page}}

== Source Transformations ==

Independent current sources can be turned into independent voltage sources, and vice-versa, by methods called &quot;Source Transformations.&quot; These transformations are useful for solving circuits. We will explain the two most important source transformations, '''Thevenin's Source''', and '''Norton's Source''', and we will explain how to use these conceptual tools for solving circuits.

== Black Boxes ==

A circuit (or any system, for that matter) may be considered a '''black box''' if we don't know what is inside the system. For instance, most people treat their computers like a black box because they don't know what is inside the computer (most don't even care), all they know is what goes in to the system (keyboard and mouse input), and what comes out of the system (monitor and printer output).

Black boxes, by definition, are systems whose internals aren't known to an outside observer. The only methods that an outside observer has to examine a black box is to send input into the systems, and gauge the output.

== Thevenin's Theorem ==

Let's start by drawing a general circuit consisting of a source and a load, as a block diagram:

[[Image:General Source-Load Circuit.svg|center]]

Let's say that the source is a collection of voltage sources, current sources and resistances, while the load is a collection of resistances only. Both the source and the load can be arbitrarily complex, but we can conceptually say that the source is directly equivalent to a single voltage source and resistance (figure (a) below).

{| align=center
|[[Image:Thevenin Equivalent.svg|center]]
|[[Image:Thevenin Equivalent Under Test.svg|center]]
|-
|align=center|''(a)''
|align=center|''(b)''
|}

We can determine the value of the resistance ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the voltage source, ''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' by attaching an independent source to the output of the circuit, as in figure (b) above. In this case we are using a current source, but a voltage source could also be used. By varying ''i'' and measuring ''v'', both ''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be found using the following equation:

::&lt;math&gt;v=v_s+iR_s \,&lt;/math&gt;

There are two variables, so two values of ''i'' will be needed. See [[/Examples#Example1|Example 1]] for more details. We can easily see from this that if the current source is set to zero (equivalent to an open circuit), then ''v'' is equal to the voltage source, ''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''. This is also called the open-circuit voltage, ''v&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;''.

This is an important concept, because it allows us to model what is inside a unknown (linear) circuit, just by knowing what is coming out of the circuit. This concept is known as '''Thévenin's Theorem''' after French telegraph engineer [[w:Léon Charles Thévenin|Léon Charles Thévenin]], and the circuit consisting of the voltage source and resistance is called the '''Thévenin Equivalent Circuit'''.

== Norton's Theorem==

Recall from above that the output voltage, ''v'', of a Thévenin equivalent circuit can be expressed as

::&lt;math&gt;v=v_s+iR_s \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let's rearrange it for the output current, ''i'':

::&lt;math&gt;i=-\frac{v_s}{R_s}+\frac{v}{R_s}&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to a KCL description of the following circuit. We can call the constant term ''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' the source current, ''i&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''. 

[[Image:Norton Equivalent Under Test.svg|center]]

The equivalent current source and the equivalent resistance can be found with an independent source as before (see [[/Examples#Example 2|Example 2]]).

When the above circuit (the '''Norton Equivalent Circuit''', after Bell Labs engineer [[w:Edward_Lawry_Norton|E.L. Norton]]) is disconnected from the external load, the current from the source all flows through the resistor, producing the requisite voltage across the terminals, ''v&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;''. Also, if we were to short the two terminals of our circuit, the current would all flow through the wire, and none of it would flow through the resistor (current divider rule). In this way, the circuit would produce the short-circuit current ''i&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which is exactly the same as the source current ''i&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'').

== Circuit Transforms ==

We have just shown turns out that the Thévenin and Norton circuits are just different representations of the same black box circuit, with the same Ohm's Law/KCL equations. This means that we cannot distinguish between Thévenin source and a Norton source from outside the black box, and that we can directly equate the two as below:

{| align=center
|[[image:Thevenin Equivalent.svg|center]]
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;
|[[image:Norton Equivalent.svg|center]]
|}

We can draw up some rules to convert between the two:

*The values of the resistors in each circuit are conceptually identical, and can be called the equivalent resistance, ''R&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'':
::&lt;math&gt;R_{s_n}=R_{s_t}=R_s=R_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;
*The value of a Thévenin voltage source is the value of the Norton current source times the equivalent resistance (Ohm's law):
::&lt;math&gt;v_s=i_sr\,&lt;/math&gt; 

If these rules are followed, the circuits will behave identically. Using these few rules, we can transform a Norton circuit into a Thévenin circuit, and vice versa. This method is called '''source transformation'''. See [[/Examples#Example 3|Example 3]].

==Open Circuit Voltage and Short Circuit Current==

The open-circuit voltage, ''v&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a circuit is the voltage across the terminals when the current is zero, and the short-circuit current ''i&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the current when the voltage across the terminals is zero:

{| align=center
|width=200|[[Image:Open Circuit Voltage.svg|center]]
|width=200|[[Image:Short Circuit Current.svg|center]]
|-
|align=center|''The open circuit voltage''
|align=center|''The short circuit current''
|}

We can also observe the following:

*The value of the Thévenin voltage source is the open-circuit voltage:
::&lt;math&gt;v_s=v_{oc}\,&lt;/math&gt;
*The value of the Norton current source is the short-circuit current:
::&lt;math&gt;i_s=i_{sc}\,&lt;/math&gt;

We can say that, generally,

::&lt;math&gt;R_{eq}=\frac{v_{oc}}{i_{sc}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Why Transform Circuits? ==

How are Thevenin and Norton transforms useful? 
:Describe a black box characteristics in a way that can predict its reaction to any load.
:Find the current through and voltage across any device by removing the device from the circuit! This can instantly make a complex circuit much simpler to analyze. 
:Stepwise simplification of a circuit is possible if voltage sources have a series impedance and current sources have a parallel impedance.</text>

== Overview ==
{{Wikipedia|BusyBox}}

BusyBox is a very popular program on many embedded Linux systems. In fact, someone working on an embedded Linux system is very likely to encounter BusyBox. BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single relatively small executable. One of the included utilities is a vi clone.

The BusyBox vi clone is limited. Among the limits are:

* It does not support all common vi commands. 
* It supports the '!' command to execute a child process, but does not capture process output
* It also lacks the normal vi crash recovery feature.
* It always assumes a vt102 type terminal (emulator)
* Only very few settings are configurable via &lt;code&gt;:set&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;.exrc&lt;code&gt; configuration and configuration via environment variables are not supported
* Line marks are not correctly adjusted if lines are inserted or deleted before the mark.
* Only whole-line undo (uppercase 'U'), no last-change undo (lowercase 'u') is supported.
* Searches ignore case by default, but can be case sensitive using &lt;code&gt;:set noignorecase&lt;/code&gt;
* Command-counts need to prefix a command
* command counts for &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; and several other commands are not supported.
* A limited set of ex commands are supported.

In short, a lot of information in this vi tutorial is not applicable to BusyBox vi.

However, BusyBox vi also has some differences (considered by some to be enhancements) over classic vi:

= What are English Language standards? =

The Handbook of English Standards wikibook exists to provide distributed authorship of standards--compiling and categorizing them for teaching and learning English. This may be for English as a primary language or for English as an additional language. You are welcome to contribute to the [[EnglishStandards|English Standards wiki]] or to use this area to discuss the writing of the wiki. 

==Why wiki standards? ==
Wiki is completely open and distributed. The idea in creating this book is to encourage a plurality of approaches to standards and benchmarks. The word on the street is that the US government discontinued the standards project because of the plurality of viewpoints. A [[EnglishStandards|wikibook]] can allow for contribution without sponsorship beyond the [[Main_Page|wikibooks group]]. Can a wiki Handbook of English Language Standards succeed? What is success? 

==Who owns educational standards?==
What do you think? A number of professional organizations and states have published their standards. Many states accredit schools and higher education institutions based on standards. Most (if not all) of these documents were created in committees or by task forces. Do you know who wrote the standards being mandated in your area of the world? If you could have contributed, how would you have done things differently? 

==Why standards at all?==
The standards movement is critiqued from a variety of viewpoints. What help or hindrance are standards in the world of teaching and learning? 

==What viewpoints need to be represented?==
Rather than beginning from existing standards documents, this wikibook has been organized to allow for a variety of viewpoints on what it means to learn and know. If you want to discuss a particular viewpoint, use this talk page (or add a viewpoint to the [[EnglishStandards|wikibook]] itself).</text>

== UK Constitution ==

Have you considered voting for [[UK Constitution and Government]] again this month, as it has been renominated.  It relly is a very good book.[[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 15:52, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== [[Social Postulates]] ==
Thanks for the information. I've expanded the book into a full project proposal so that the tasks can be automated. It is beneficial to see the information in book form for the next 3-5 months until the project is up and running. At that time, I plan to delete the book unless someone else wants to use it as a textbook to document the unique philosophical questions raised and answered during the formation of the project. --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 15:39, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

== Muggle Vandalism ==

Thanks for the heads up. I watch the high-profile pages of the book but I wouldn't have caught one of those. The real problem with the book is that there are so many content pages that I can't keep track of all the new ones created in the book in order to enforce project standards. They were really just bad edits and so I removed them, but I wouldn't necessarily call them vandalism. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 19:26, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

== Thanks a lot ==

Thanks for reverting that vandal in the Magician Guide in Maple Story. That was most definitly a vandal.

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:18, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

==[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] Change of text==

You voted for enforcement of [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]. The text of this policy has been changed by [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] during the vote, I have further modified these changes to restore some of the original &quot;bite&quot;. This is highly unusual but without these changes [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] is unwilling to allow the policy to move to enforced. I am happy that the changes are not sufficiently substantial to undermine the policy, if you disagree then please make your views known. Changes to text during a vote could be construed as a delaying tactic so I have proposed a move to &quot;enforced&quot; status by 1st June. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:08, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

==Modal Logic==

Hello, I started writing the section on modal logic in the introduction to philosophy:logic wikibooks some time ago but, as you say, everything became a bit too messy. If you would like any help with modal logic or any help with extending, changing or clearing up the part I am responsible for, please feel free to leave me a message.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A lot of experiments just have two possible outcomes, generally referred to as &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot;. If such an experiment is independently repeated we call them (a series of) '''Bernoulli trials'''. Usually the probability of success is called p. The repetition may be done in several ways:

*a fixed number of times (n); as a consequence the observed number of successes is stochastic;
*until a fixed number of successes (m) is observed; as a consequence the number of experiments is stochastic;

In the first case the number of successes is Binomial distributed with parameters n and p. For n=1 the distribution is also called the Bernoulli distribution.
In the second case the number of experiments is Negative Binomial distributed with parameters m and p. For m=1 the distribution is also called the Geometric distribution.

Suppose that we are given a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that is continuous on an interval {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and we want to calculate the length of the curve drawn out by the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; from {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} to {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=b&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  If the graph were a straight line this would be easy — the formula for the length of the line is given by Pythagoras' theorem.  And if the graph were a piecewise linear function we can calculate the length by adding up the length of each piece.

The problem is that most graphs are not linear.  Nevertheless we can estimate the length of the curve by approximating it with straight lines.  Suppose the curve &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is given by the formula {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} for {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;a\le x\le b&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  We divide the interval {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; subintervals with equal width &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and endpoints {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  Now let {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y_i=f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} so {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;P_i=(x_i,y_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} is the point on the curve above &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;.  The length of the straight line between &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; |P_iP_{i+1}| = \sqrt{ (y_{i+1} - y_{i})^2 + (x_{i+1}-{x_i})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

So an estimate of the length of the curve &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the sum
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} |P_iP_{i+1}| &lt;/math&gt;

As we divide the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; into more pieces this gives a better estimate for the length of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  In fact we make that a definition.

{{Calculus/Def | title=Length of a Curve | text=The length of the curve &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a\le x\le b&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be
:&lt;math&gt;L = \lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} |P_{i+1}P_i|&lt;/math&gt;
}}
 
== The Arclength Formula ==

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  Then the length of the curve given by {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(x))^2 } dx&lt;/math&gt;
And in Leibniz notation
:&lt;math&gt; L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ 1+ \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2 } dx&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:''' Consider {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} - y_i= f(x_{i+1}) -f(x_i).&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}  By the [[Calculus/Mean Value Theorem for Functions|Mean Value Theorem]] there is a point &lt;math&gt; z_i&lt;/math&gt; in {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;(x_{i+1},x_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} such that
:&lt;math&gt; y_{i+1} - y_i= f(x_{i+1}) -f(x_i)= f'(z_i) (x_{i+1}-x_i)\,&lt;/math&gt;

So
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}|P_iP_{i+1}|&amp;=\sqrt{ (y_{i+1} - y_{i})^2 + (x_{i+1}-x_i)^2}\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (f'(z_i))^2 (x_{i+1}-x_i)^2 + (x_{i+1}-x_i)^2 }\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (1+(f'(z_i))^2) (x_{i+1}-x_i)^2 }\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (1+(f'(z_i))^2)} \Delta x\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Putting this into the definition of the length of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;L=\lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sqrt{ (1+(f'(z_i))^2)} \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;

Now this is the definition of the integral of the function {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;g(x) = \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; (notice that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is continuous because we are assuming that &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is continuous).  Hence 

:&lt;math&gt;L=\int_a^b \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2} dx&lt;/math&gt;

as claimed.

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example:  Length of the curve {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=2x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} from {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} to {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}}}
As a sanity check of our formula, let's calculate the length of the &quot;curve&quot; {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=2x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} from {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} to {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  First let's find the answer using the Pythagorean Theorem.
:&lt;math&gt;P_0=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;P_1=(1,2)&lt;/math&gt;
so the length of the curve, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, is
:&lt;math&gt;s=\sqrt{2^2+1^2}=\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;
Now let's use the formula
:&lt;math&gt;s=\int_0^1 \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{d(2x)}{dx}\right)^2}=\int_0^1 \sqrt{1+2^2}=\sqrt{5}x\bigr|_0^1=\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;

== Arclength of a parametric curve ==

For a parametric curve, that is, a curve defined by {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=f(t)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=g(t)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, the formula is slightly different:
:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ (f'(t))^2 + (g'(t))^2 }\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:''' The proof is analogous to the previous one:
Consider {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} - y_i= g(t_{i+1}) -g(t_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and 
{{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x_{i+1} - x_i= f(t_{i+1}) -f(t_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.
By the Mean Value Theorem there are points &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; in {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;(t_{i+1},t_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} such that
:&lt;math&gt; y_{i+1} - y_i= g(t_{i+1}) -g(t_i)= g'(c_i) (t_{i+1}-t_i)\,&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;  x_{i+1} - x_i= f(t_{i+1}) -f(t_i)= f'(d_i) (t_{i+1}-t_i)\,&lt;/math&gt;

So
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}|P_iP_{i+1}|&amp;=\sqrt{ (y_{i+1} - y_{i})^2 + (x_{i+1}-x_i)^2}\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (g'(c_i))^2 (t_{i+1}-t_i)^2 + (f'(d_i))^2 (t_{i+1}-t_i)^2 }\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (f'(d_i))^2)+(g'(c_i))^2) (t_{i+1}-t_i)^2 }\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (f'(d_i))^2 + (g'(c_i))^2} \Delta t\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Putting this into the definition of the length of the curve gives
:&lt;math&gt;L=\lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sqrt{ (f'(d_i))^2 + (g'(c_i))^2 } \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;
This is equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;L=\int_a^b \sqrt{ (f'(t))^2 + (g'(t))^2}\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

I think some examples would be helpful.
I was considering using a simple example such as f(x)=2x.
Any objections?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Syllogism==
A syllogism is an inference, consisting of three statements in which a conclusion follows as a matter of necessity from two given premises.  A classic example of a syllogims is:

::: All humans are mortal (major premise)
::: All Greeks are human (minor premise)
::: therefore, All Greeks are mortal (conclusion)

===Qualities of Statements===
Each of these statements are said to have the quality of being universally affirmative (all humans are mortal), universally negative (no humans are mortal), particularly affirmative (some humans are mortal), or particularly negative (some humans are not mortal).  A statement which is universally affirmative may be designated by writing the letter, '''A'''.  A universal negative statement is designated by the letter, '''E'''.  A particular affirmative statement is designated by the letter, '''I''', and a particular negative statement, by the letter, '''O'''.  All of the above statements are universally affirmative.

====Exercises 1.1====
State whether each of the following statements are universally affirmative, universally negative, particularly affirmative, or particularly negative by designating them with an '''A''', '''E''', '''I''', or '''O'''.

== 1. Explain and illustrate an experiment by which the laws of electrical attraction and repulsion are shown.==
This simple experiment can be performed with nothing more exotic than a roll of plastic, transparent tape - the kind usually found on a desk.  Remove two 12&quot; strips of tape from the roll and hold them by the end, one in each hand.  Removing the tape from the roll will charge the strips with static electricity.

Now bring the two strips of together.  They will repel one another.  Next, fold the top of one strip over itself, creating a half-inch long &quot;non-sticky&quot; zone.  Then attach the two strips, with the folded strip's sticky side to the other strip's non-sticky side.  Pull them apart by holding onto the non-sticky zone.  Now the two strips will be attracted to one another.

== 2. Explain the difference between direct and alternating current, and demonstrate the uses to which each is adapted.  Give a method of determining which kind flows in a given circuit. ==

Electricity in a direct current (DC) circuit flows in only one direction.  In an alternating current (AC) circuit, the direction of current flow reverses at a regular rate.  Similarly, the voltage in a DC circuit remains constant, while it continuously varies in an AC circuit.  

Batteries are capable of storing DC voltage only - they cannot store AC voltage.  Most electronic circuitry runs on DC, and electronic appliances that run on AC power usually convert it to DC before it can be used.  The advantage AC has over DC is that it can be transmitted over long distances with less loss than a DC circuit providing an equivalent amount of power.

AC circuitry produces a constantly varying magnetic field, and a constantly varying magnetic field will induce a current in an adjacent conductor.  The induced current can be measured with a current meter.  DC circuitry will only induce a current when a sudden change in the circuit takes place, such as powering it on.  The induced current will &quot;spike&quot; briefly and then decay to zero.

== 3. Connect a buzzer, bell, or light with a battery using a switch in line. ==

[[Image:Lamp_circuit.png|Light, battery, and switch]]

The circuit above shows how to connect a battery, switch, and light.  The light can be replaced with the bell or buzzer.

== 4. Make and run a simple electric motor from a kit or take apart a motor and identify the parts, and explain how it works. ==
There are several low cost motor kits available on the market.  Here are links to a few:
* [http://www.simplemotor.com/rsmotor.htm ISP Corporation]

* [http://www.science-city.com/elmotkit.html MiniLabs]

* [http://www.sciplus.com/singleItem.cfm?terms=9460&amp;cartLogFrom=froogle American Science and Surplus]

It is far more economical to bring in a single motor rather than have each student buy a kit.  Small motors can be bought at most hobby stores, and each student can take turns disassembling it.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

The classic DC motor has a rotating armature in the form of an electromagnet with two poles.  
A rotary switch called a commutator reverses the direction of the electric current twice every cycle, to flow through the armature so that the poles of the electromagnet push and pull against the permanent magnets on the outside of the motor.  As the poles of the armature electromagnet pass the poles of the permanent magnets, the commutator reverses the polarity of the armature electromagnet. During that instant of switching polarity, inertia keeps the classical motor going in the proper direction. (See the diagrams below.)

&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Electric_motor_cycle_1.png|left|thumb|200px|A simple DC electric motor. When the coil is powered, a magnetic field is generated around the armature. The left side of the armature is pushed away from the left magnet and drawn toward the right, causing rotation.]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Electric_motor_cycle_2.png|left|thumb|200px|The armature continues to rotate.]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Electric_motor_cycle_3.png|left|thumb|200px|When the armature becomes horizontally aligned, the commutator reverses the direction of current through the coil, reversing the magnetic field. The process then repeats.]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

== 5. Make a simple battery cell. ==
A battery can be made by placing a galvanized (zinc-plated) nail and a copper wire in a small container filled with vinegar.  Do not let the zinc and copper terminals touch one another.  They can be held apart by punching small holes in the container's lid and inserting them through these holes.  A film canister works pretty well for this, but so will a paper or foam cup covered with plastic wrap (or just put the two conductors on opposite sides of the container).  As long as the two conductors can both be immersed in the vinegar without touching one another, a voltage should develop between them.

It might help to brighten the nail and the copper with sandpaper or emory cloth first.  A cell constructed like this will generate about 0.8 volts.  The copper wire will be the positive terminal (anode) and the zinc plated nail will be the negative terminal (cathode).  

Connect multiple cells in series to form a battery and boost the voltage.  When doing this, be sure to connect the positive terminal (copper) of one cell to the negative terminal (zinc) of the other.  

Connect multiple cells in parallel to boost the current capacity (necessary to light up a bulb).  To do this, connect all the nails together with one wire and connect all the copper terminals together with another wire.

== 6. Demonstrate the ability to replace fuses or reset breakers and demonstrate a National Electric Code (NEC) approved splice using insulated wires. ==
There are many types of fuses.  Some of them have threaded bases and can be removed by rotating them counter-clockwise.  Others have to be pried out of their holders.  Always remember that household current is dangerous, so it is best to cut the power first.  This requirement can also be met by changing the fuse in an automobile or appliance (unplug first!).

A breaker is a current-sensing switch.  Circuits can be turned off by flipping the switch away from the center of the breaker panel, and turned back on again by flipping the switch towards the center of the breaker panel.  When a breaker senses that the current flowing through it exceeds its rated threshold, the switch opens by itself, moving the toggle between the off position and the on position.  The breaker is said to have &quot;tripped&quot; when this happens.  Before a tripped breaker can be reset, it must first be turned fully to the off position, and ''then'' it can be returned to the on position.  If the breaker trips again, the circuit is still overloaded.  If this is the case, turn off some of the appliances in the circuit before attempting to reset the breaker again.

== 7. Show how you would rescue a person in contact with a live electric wire, and have a knowledge of the method of reviving a person insensible from shock. ==
First, '''do not touch the person! '''  Instead, turn off the power as quickly as possible.  If you cannot find the switch, use a non-conducting pole such as a wooden broom handle, a non-metallic chair, a shoe, or some similar object and move the wire off the person.  Be sure to move the wire far enough away so that it will not reconnect with the victim when released.  Be careful to ''not'' touch the wire with any part of your body.

Once the victim has been disconnected from the current, call 911.  If the victim is not breathing, start CPR.  If the victim is breathing, but unconscious, maneuver the body onto its side to prevent the victim's tongue from blocking the air passage.

== 8. Make a simple diagram of a lighting system of an automobile. ==

[[Image:Car_lights.png|thumb|650px|Simplified automobile lighting system diagram]]
{{clear}}

== 9. Make a diagram that properly shows the lights, switches, and convenience outlets controlled by each breaker in a house. ==

[[Image:House_circuit.png|600px|thumb|Typical House Circuit]]

The schematic above shows a typical circuit in a household.  The circuit as shown is protected by a fuse (although a breaker would be applicable as well), and has three loads:

# A light controlled by a single switch
# An unswitched outlet
# A light controlled by two switches

More outlets and switches can be added to the circuit, but note that they will all be connected in parallel.  All circuits will connect to the black &quot;'hot'&quot; wire and to the white &quot;'neutral'&quot; wire.  

A typical house will have about two dozen breakers, and it is rare for a circuit to have more than about eight outlets or lights.  Having too many lights or outlets on a single circuit will cause the breaker to trip or the fuse to blow, so several circuits are run in a house.

== 10. Read an electric meter correctly, and compute a residence bill at the rate charged in your community. ==
Electric meters measure electricity in ''kilowatt hours.'' One kilowatt hour (kWh) will provide 1000 watts for one hour.  Electric companies typically charge a flat rate per kilowatt hour, and this rate can be found on an electric bill.  Some electric companies charge varying rates depending on ''when'' the electricity is used, charging a lesser rate when electrical demand is lower (such as during the night).  For this requirement it is a lot easier to assume a flat rate, but even then utility companies do not always make it easy.  For example, they may break the rate down into several components and they may add flat fees as well.  If this is the case for you, simply add all the component rates together to get an aggregate rate.  The component rates can be very small values - fractions of a penny.

To calculate the rate, one must first read the meter.  The meter is not reset when it's read, so one must know what the meter read during the previous billing cycle.  The current reading is subtracted from the previous reading, and the difference is multiplied by the rate.

&lt;math&gt;bill = \left((current\ reading - previous\ reading)\times  aggregate\ rate \right)+flat\ fees&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Mechanical_electricity_meter_1965_(1).jpg|400px]]

The meter pictured above shows 60169.1 kilowatt hours (not 60279.1 - the dials have not yet reached the 2 or the 7 yet).  To calculate an electric bill assume the following:

Previous month's reading: 59023.6 kWh

Aggregate rate: 11.274 cents per kWh

Flat fees: $20

The bill would be calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}bill &amp; =&amp; \left( (60169.1 - 59023.6) \times 0.11274\right) \ +\ $20 \\ \ &amp; =&amp; (1146.5 \times 0.11274)\ +\ $20 \\ \ &amp; =&amp; $129.14\ +\ $20\\ \ &amp;=&amp; $149.14\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is rounded to the nearest cent.

The Renaissance is a period in European history that covers the 15th century to the 17th century. The word &quot;renaissance&quot; means &quot;rebirth&quot; in Italian and describes the rediscovery of the knowledge and art of Classical Greece and Rome. The roots of the Renaissance can be found in the Crusades of the 11th century onwards. The Crusaders main aim was to liberate Jerusalem from Muslim control and one of the more positive effects of the Crusades was the rediscovery of ancient texts and art. News of books and artifacts that had been unavailable in Europe were brought back by Crusaders and this led to a renewed interest in Classical Greece and Rome. It must be noted that diplomatic contact and trade between Europe and the East continued throughout the Crusades and many texts were acquired by Europeans perfectly peacefully. One of the most quoted finds is &lt;i&gt;The Almagest&lt;/i&gt; by Ptomely; a work on astronomy. The Almagest was written in the 2nd century C.E and translated into Arabic in the 9th century. It was rediscovered in the 12th century by European scholars and translated into Spanish and Latin. This influx of texts and art from the East revitalised Classical studies in the West. Scholars in the West could now compare their Medieval texts (sometimes complete or fragments) against earlier copies or read works that had been known about in the West but had been presumed to have been permanently lost. These discoveries had a great affect on European culture and art. There was a determined effort by Renaissance composers to bring back to life the plays of the Ancient Greeks and Romans. Renaissance painters used the themes and mythology of the Classical period for inspiration. Renaissance sculpture absorbed the Classical aesthetic on form and many Renaissance statues show a sense of balance in portraying the human form that would be instantly recognisable to an Athenian of the 5th century BC.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
Now that you know how to use the Dock and Menu Bar (because you did read Chapter 1, right?), it's time to learn how to use the rest of your Mac's interface. In this chapter, you'll learn how to deal with windows, sheets, sliders, scrollbars, and all of the other elements of the Mac interface. From the next chapter onwards, you'll learn to apply what you've learned to real-world uses of your Mac.

A lot of this chapter should be a review for you, since in many ways the Mac interface is similar to the interfaces of competing operating systems such as Microsoft Windows. However, there will definitely be things in this chapter that you do not already know, so pay close attention.

=Windows=
[[Image:Tiger Interface Shot.png|thumb|830px|center|Fig. 1 - Three windows. Notice how they are stacked on top of one another.]]
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Mac OS X, like most modern operating systems, uses a &quot;windowed&quot; interface.&lt;/font&gt; That means it displays information in a stack of overlapping rectangular boxes called &quot;windows&quot;. The window at the front of the stack is the only one you can interact with, and is called the &quot;active window&quot;. You can bring any ''in''active window to the front of the stack by clicking anywhere inside it.

==Title Bars==
[[Image:Tiger Title Bar.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 2 - A title bar. Note the tri-colored buttons in the left side.]]
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Every window has a &quot;title bar&quot; at the top.&lt;/font&gt; This strip contains the window's name, or title, along with three little round buttons on the left side. These three buttons are colored red, yellow, and green from left to right.  Rolling over these buttons causes them to display (respectively) an ×, −, and +.

*Close - Clicking the red button (×) closes the window, but does not necessarily quit the application (program) the window belongs to. This is a common point of confusion in Mac OS X, because in Windows XP, if a program is left without any windows, it closes automatically. This is not so in the Mac OS; most applications will not quit unless explicitly told to do so through the appropriate command in the Menu Bar. If a dot appears in the red button, there is unsaved information in the window. If you close the window, you will be asked to acknowledge this and either save the information or lose it forever.

*Minimize - Click the yellow button (−), and the window &quot;minimizes&quot; (shrinks to the size of a postage stamp and flys into the right side of the Dock). These minimized windows can be &quot;Maximized&quot; (returned to their normal state) by simply clicking on their images in the Dock.

*Zoom - Click the green button (+), and the window attempts to resize itself so its contents fit exactly.  Click the green button again, and the window will resize to its previous dimensions.

==Toolbars==
[[Image:Tiger Mail Toolbar.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 3 - This toolbar is for the Mail application. Notice that it is directly below the title bar.]]
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Toolbars are strips of controls that activate certain commands (for more on these controls, see below). Toolbars usually appear along the top of a window (directly below the title bar), but sometimes appear along the bottom or side.&lt;/font&gt;

Toolbars are usually customizable; that is, you can add or remove controls, change their order, and group them according to how you use them. To customize a toolbar, right-click it and choose &quot;Customize Toolbar...&quot;. A sheet (see below) appears, showing every control the application has to offer. You can drag controls from the sheet into the toolbar to add them, out of the toolbar to remove them, or horizontally to reorder them. You can drag in &quot;Space&quot;, &quot;Flexible Space&quot;, and &quot;Divider&quot; to organize controls into groups.

==Panes==
[[Image:Tiger Mail Panes.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 4 - This window is divided into three panes, outlined in red for illustrative purposes.]] 
In architecture, there are many styles of windows. Perhaps the style most commonly used today is the &quot;divided-light&quot; window. These windows consist of multiple panes of glass, held together by strips of wood called mullions.

&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;As in architecture, it often makes sense to divide a computer &quot;window&quot; into multiple &quot;panes&quot;.&lt;/font&gt; Get the joke? The &quot;mullions&quot; that hold these virtual panes together are referred to simply as dividers. Quite often, dividers are adjustable. Dragging on the small dot in the middle of a divider lets you adjust the proportions of the panes on either side. For example, in Fig. 4, a divider with a dot separates the top and bottom panes. Dragging the dot upwards will make the bottom pane larger and the top pane smaller. Dragging the dot down will do the opposite: the top pane will become bigger and the bottom smaller.

Sometimes, applications forgo a divider and simply draw a thin line between panes. These are also adjustable, but you'll have to look around a bit to find the &quot;handle&quot; you can drag to resize the panes on either side. These handles are usually marked by three vertical lines. A line like this separates the left sidebar in Fig. 4 from the top and bottom panes to its right. To adjust the size of this particular sidebar pane, you must drag the three vertical lines in the lower-left of the window.

==Scrollbars==
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;You'll often find yourself working with a document larger than the window or pane that contains it. When this happens, Mac OS X busts out &quot;scrollbars&quot;.&lt;/font&gt; Named after the scrolls of medieval times, these strips appear along the edges of a pane. A scrollbar appears along the right side of the pane if the information within is ''taller'' than the pane itself. If the information is ''wider'', a scrollbar appears along the bottom.

Each scrollbar is divided into three parts:
*Scroll Track - This like a &quot;groove&quot; with a blue strip in it. The blue strip is the &quot;scroller&quot;, explained below. that the scroller sits in.
*Scroller - This blue pill-shaped strip represents the portion of the document which is visible. The larger the scroller is in relation to the scroll track, the more of the document is visible. The ''position' of the scroller in relation to the scroll track tells you ''which'' part of the document you are viewing. Dragging the scroller lets you view different parts of the document.
*Scroll Buttons - These little arrow buttons at the end of the scrollbar let you scroll one &quot;unit&quot; of space in a certain direction. The length of a unit depends on the application you are working in.

==Status Bars==
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Status Bars are strips that appear along the bottom of some (but not all) windows.&lt;/font&gt; They usually contain text pertaining to the window's status, but can also contain controls like a toolbar would.

==Resize Handles==
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;The bottom-right corner of most windows can be dragged with your cursor to give the window whatever dimensions you wish. These corners have three little tactile-looking ridges, providing a visual cue to their special sizing power.&lt;/font&gt;

=Palettes and HUDs=
[[Image:Tiger Pages Palette and HUD.png|thumb|830px|center|Fig. 5 - A HUD and a Palette. Notice that you can see the desktop through the HUD, since it's translucent.]]
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Palettes, also refered to as &quot;Utility Windows&quot;, are miniature windows that contain information and controls designed to complement a larger window.&lt;/font&gt; They have skinny little title bars, and do not appear in the Window menu or in Exposé (see below).

&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;There is a second flavor of palette called a HUD.&lt;/font&gt; No, you don't pronounce that &quot;hudd&quot; (a common mistake). H-U-D stands for &quot;heads-up-display&quot;. These are palettes that are black and translucent, just like a heads-up-display on say, a fighter jet. &lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Other than their looks, there is no difference between a HUD and a palette.&lt;/font&gt;

=Sheets=
[[Image:Tiger Pages 2 Print Sheet.png|thumb|830px|center|Fig. 6 - A sheet attached to a window. You can't interact with anything else in this window until you dismiss the sheet, but you ''can'' interact with other windows.]]
If you're familiar with computers, you're familiar with the concept of a dialog box. This computing mainstay has been offering warnings, options, and advice for years. But dialog boxes are often overkill; they take center stage and prevent you from doing anything until you acknowledge them. While there is certainly a place for this (for instance, warnings and alerts that you absolutely must see), quite often dialog boxes apply to only a single window. For this purpose, Apple has phased out dialog boxes in favor of a new invention of their own: the &quot;sheet&quot;.

&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;A sheet looks like a sheet of paper that rolls out from the title bar of a window. Unlike the dialog boxes of old, which blocked access to everything on your computer until you closed them, sheets only prevent access to the ''single window that they are attached to'' until you close them.&lt;/font&gt; This lets individual applications get your attention without blocking access to others.

=Drawers=
A drawer works a lot like a drawer in a desk. It's a pane that slides in and out of the side of a window. It seems like they are being phased out by Apple, which is replacing them with sidebar panes, but there are still a few here and there in Mac OS X. You'll hear more about drawers when you read about the applications that use them.

=Exposé=
{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| [[Image:Tiger Exposé Before.png|thumb|375px|Fig. 7 - Before Exposé...]]
| [[Image:Tiger Exposé All Windows.png|thumb|375px|Fig. 8 - ... and after Exposé!]]
|}
Exposé is a neat little feature with big implications. It cuts through the clutter that results from having a large number of windows open at the same time. More specifically, it lets you visualize your open windows in two different ways, and can also temporarily hide all of them. &lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Each function of Exposé is activated by a different key on your keyboard.&lt;/font&gt;

#'''All Windows''' (the F9 key by default) - Pressing this key darkens your desktop and shrinks all of your windows into thumbnails. Exposé makes these thumbnails just small enough so that they don't overlap at all. Roll over a window with your cursor, and it will display its title. Clicking any window will return your Desktop to how it was before, but now with the window you clicked on in front of all others.
#'''Application Windows''' (the F10 key by default) - The second way to Exposé is a variation on &quot;All Windows&quot;. It tiles only the windows of the current, front-most application. If you have a bunch of websites in Safari and documents in Microsoft Word open, and you know you're looking for a Word document, then simply bring Word to the front and press F10.
#'''Desktop''' (the F11 key by default) - This key temporarily pushes all windows out of the way, giving you an unobstructed view of your desktop. To show your windows again, press the key again.

=Controls=
Apple uses a plethora of buttons, sliders, and other little gadgets throughout OS X and other applications. Use this list as a reference:

*'''Buttons''' - The most common control in the Mac OS, buttons are pill-shaped and made of glass. Their labels provide a clue as to what happens when you click on them.
*'''Button Menus''' - These oddball buttons sprout menus when you click on them. They are marked with a little triangle on their right side.
*'''Toolbar Buttons''' - Buttons in a window's toolbar (see above) can take on a variety of appearances. Sometimes they appear simply as icons. At other times, they will look more like standard buttons made of glass, plastic, or any other material the developer sees fit. As you use various applications, you will learn how toolbar buttons look in each one.
*'''Conjoined Buttons''' - Conjoined buttons are just that: two or more buttons joined together. Sometimes buttons are conjoined to show that they are related; at other times they are conjoined to show that only one button in the group can be activated at a time.
*'''Tabs''' - Tabs look like conjoined buttons at the top of a grey box. Clicking on different tabs will cause different things to appear in the grey box. The tab that you are currently viewing is highlighted in blue.
*'''Toolbar Tabs''' - Tabs inside a window's toolbar ''look'' just like toolbar buttons but ''act'' just like normal tabs. The tab you are currently viewing is highlighted in grey. 
*'''Checkboxes''' - These look like the checkboxes you might find in a tax form. You can check and uncheck them with one click. When a checkbox is checked, it lights up blue. 
*'''Radio Buttons''' - These special, round checkboxes always come in groups of two or more. Exactly one radio button in a group is always selected; you can't select more than one, and you can't select none at all.
*'''Sliders''' - These look like a slider you might find on a piece of machinery. They can be horizontal or vertical. You can drag them with your cursor to adjust a setting.
*'''Dials''' - A dial, also known as a knob, looks like a knob you might use to adjust the volume on your stereo. Drag one in a circular motion to adjust a setting.
*'''Pop-Up Menus''' - These are menus full of choices embedded ''inside a window'' as a control. Click on the blue triangle at the right side of a pop-up menu to view the options inside.
*'''Color Wells''' - These are used to select a color for something; perhaps part of a page layout you're working on or the title of your next hit movie. They look like clear, rectangular buttons with a colored square inside. Clicking them opens the application's color picker, letting you pick the color of your choice.
*'''Image Wells''' - Image wells are &quot;slots&quot; where you can insert an image. They resemble a well in a slide that one would look at under a microscope. Drag and drop an image into the well to use it.
*'''Progress Bars''' - When a task is being performed by your Mac, it often displays some sort of progress bar. These are glossy strips that gradually fill up with a blue color from left to right. When the blue reaches the right side of the bar, the task is complete. Sometimes your Mac can't tell how long a task is going to take. In this case, the progress bar displays bands of blue (like a barber pole) that move from left to right.
*'''Progress Spinners''' - When space is tight or the task being performed takes only a few seconds, Mac OS X will use a progress spinner to show that work is being done. The progress spinner is a tiny sunburst of grey lines which brighten and darken to give a spinning effect. It gives no indication as to how far along your Mac is with its task.
*'''Capacity Bar''' - This thick status bar displays the level of something - perhaps the battery life remaining in your wireless mouse. Sometimes it is split into sections, other times it's one long continous strip. The color can change according to how much the bar is filled.
*'''Rating Indicator''' - The rating indicator displays the rating of an item in &quot;stars&quot;. How these work vary from application to application, so please see each application's section of this wikibook for more information.
*'''Relevancy Bar''' - When searching for an item, sometimes relevancy bars appear next to their names, indicating how closely they match the terms for your search.
*'''Text Fields''' - Text fields are squarish white boxes that you can type text into.
*'''Steppers''' - Some text fields are designed to contain numbers. If you want to adjust the number in one of these fields, you can either manually type it in, or you can use the two vertical arrows you might find next door - steppers. These little arrow buttons let you &quot;step&quot; the number in the field up or down.
*'''Token Fields''' - Token fields look like a text field, but are designed to hold multiple items, separated by commas. As you type the items, they turn into blue rounded &quot;tokens&quot;. These can be dragged and dropped as an object. Some tokens also include built-in pop-up menus.
*'''Search Fields''' - Search fields are pill-shaped text fields that have a little magnifying glass symbol in the left side. You can search for items in a window or around your computer simply by typing your query into one of these guys. Sometimes you will have to press enter after typing to begin searching, but at other times searching happens automatically.
*'''Combo Boxes''' - Combo boxes ''combine'' a pop-up menu and a text field. You can choose an option either by selecting it as you would with a pop-up menu, or typing it in as you would with a text field.
*'''Disclosure Triangles''' - Also known as &quot;flippy triangles&quot;, these controls always appear next to a heading. If the triangle is pointing to the right, then the information under the heading is hidden. Click on the triangle and it flips down, showing the information. Click on the triangle again and it flips back up, hiding the information.
*'''Disclosure Buttons''' - These are disclosure triangles inside buttons. Clicking one causes the dialog box or sheet the button is in to show or hide some extra options and controls.
*'''Locks''' - Some windows contain settings that can only be modified by the administrator (owner) of your computer. These windows show little padlocks at the bottom. When the padlock is in the &quot;locked&quot; position, clicking the padlock asks you for your administrator password, which if entered correctly, will grant access to the administrator-only controls in the window. Clicking an ''un''locked padlock locks the controls again, so the next person who walks up to your Mac can't adjust any of the controls while you aren't looking.

[[Image:SAS.gif]]

We can prove ΔRPQ is congruent to ΔVST because both angle RQP and angle VTS are 100°. Segments PQ and ST are both 4 units, as well as RQ and VT are both 5 units. Therefore, both triangles are congruent by side-angle-side congruency.

| '''Hypotenuse Leg Congruency Theorem:''' If a right triangle has a leg and hypotenuse equal to the corresponding parts of the other triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

[[Image:ASA.gif]]

Angle BAP is a right angle and angle PDC is also a right angle.So they are equal. Angle APB of triangle BAP and angle CPD of triangle DPC are opposite angles and they are equal. Segments AP and PD are both 5 units.Since , the two angles and a side of the triangle BAP is equal to the two angles and a side of the triangle DPC , the both triangles are congruent.

=== AAS Congruency ===
:{| style=&quot;border:1px solid #999; text-align:left;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| '''Angle-Angle-Side Congruency Theorem:''' If one side and two angles of one triangle equal the corresponding parts of the other, then the triangles are congruent.
|}
[[Image:AAS.gif]]

We can prove ΔABC is congruent to ΔYXZ because angle CAB and angle ZYX are congruent (both 75°), angles ACB and YZX are congruent (both 65°), and AB is congruent to YX (nonincluded side). Therefore, both triangles are congruent by angle-angle-side.

=== AAA doesn't work ===
:{| style=&quot;border:1px solid #999; text-align:left;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;

==Basic Principles of Congruent Triangles==
'''Conjecture 1:''' If two triangles are congruent, then their corresponding parts are equal.

==Chapter Review==

In order to prove that two [[Geometry/Triangle|triangles]] are congruent, three pieces of information are necessary.  The three pieces of information can be 
* the lengths of all three sides
* the lengths of 2 sides and the size of the included angle
* 2 angle measurements and the length of the enclosed side
* 2 angle measurements and the length of the following side

For right triangles, only two pieces of information are necessary.  If you can show that the hypotenuse and another side are congruent on each triangle, then you know that the triangles on the whole are congruent.

It is worth noting that you cannot prove that two triangles are congruent if you only know their angle measurements.  Even if you know every angle in each triangle, the lengths of the sides could be different.

==Vocabulary==

*'''Side-Side-Side Congruency Theorem''': If three sides of one triangle equal the corresponding parts of the other, then the triangles are congruent.
*'''Side-Angle-Side Congruency Theorem''': If two sides and the included angle of one triangle equal the corresponding parts of the other, then the triangles are congruent
*'''Angle-Side-Angle Congruency Theorem''': If two angles and the included side of one triangle equal the corresponding parts of the other, then the triangles are congruent.
*'''Angle-Angle-Side Congruency Theorem''': If one side and two angles of one triangle equal the corresponding parts of the other, then the triangles are congruent.
*'''Hypotenuse Leg Congruency Theorem''': If a right triangle has a leg and hypotenuse equal to the corresponding parts of the other triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

==Exercises==
Answers to each exercise can be found in the Appendix.

# In triangle RUN and triangle HID, angle R = angle D, angle U = angle I, and RU = DI. What triangles are congruent, if any, and why?
# In triangle FRE and SLV, FR = LV, EF = SL, and angle F = angle S. What triangles are congruent, if any, and why?
# In triangle MUS and CHR, angle S = angle H, US = HR, and angle U = angle R. What triangles are congruent, if any, and why?
# In triangle QWE and RTY, QW = TY, WE = RY, and QE = RT. What triangles are congruent, if any, and why?

The character 'り' (ri) doesn't seem to match the brush stroke image very well.  Maybe the picture should be changed?  Or maybe a note could be added explaining why they don't look the same.  I am a learner here so I may be missing something...

: The printed form り is a bit different from the handwritten form. In the printed form, the two strokes of the handwritten form are being written without lifting pen from paper. I added a note to the page. Thanks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The proper way of removing hands is to use a hand remover.  These have jaws that fit under the hands, with a slot to go around the posts.  Most will pry against the dial.  

For most hand removers, it is best to put something between the hands and the dial--A slotted piece of watch tissue is best, but other similar materials will work.  (Watch tissue is pre-cut squares of thin paper, similar to wrapping tissue.  Smooth and not very absorbent, unlike facial tissue)

If you are using makeshift tools, make sure you lift on both sides evenly, rather than trying to pry one side until the hand comes off.  This is especially important on seconds hands, their pinion is fairly fragile, and the hands frequently have a tube.  You can either pry alternately on each side, or better pry on both sides at once with two tools. 

Especially with makeshift tools, it is likely that the hand will jump across the room when removed.  You may want to work inside a plastic bag, or place a blob of watch cleaning putty on the tip of the hand. 

On most (but not all) watches, it is not necessary to remove the hour hand, it's wheel will just lift off the dial.  Most Timex mechanicals only require removal of the seconds hand, the minute and hour hands can stay with the dial.  

It can be helpful to set the hands to 12:00 before removing them, especially on calendar watches.  

To align the hands on a calendar watch, set the time with no hands until the calendar is advanced to where it should be at midnight, then replace the hands. 

There are special tools to replace hands, but a pair of tweezers held open just enough to clear the post the hand fits on (for hour and minute hands) works well.  Make sure the hands are parallel with the dial, and that all hands can travel around without touching the dial, dial markers, other hands or the crystal.

The process of creating a &quot;green screen&quot; shot has two main parts: shooting and post production.

=Shooting Green-Screen=
==General tips==

* Light the green background evenly and brightly but don't overexpose it
** Your best bet to get the correct exposure is to run a few tests in a methodological fashion.
** If you can't afford to run tests then light the green screen at about 1 stop over key (i.e. light your greenscreen to reflect twice as much light as your foreground elements and then set your camera's exposure to comfortably capture the foreground elements).
* Try to avoid using filters on the lens.  Diffusion can make the key very hard to pull. (And make sure the lens is clean!)
* Avoid throwing shadows on the green screen
* Try to limit the amount of reflected green light bouncing from the screen onto the actors (this can be achieved by careful lighting; by moving the foreground elements as far away from the green screen as possible or by simply covering unused sections of the green screen in black)
* Avoid using the same colour in the actor's clothes as in the green screen.
* One way to check that your exposure is about correct is to place a bit of white card under the key light and then view the scene through a green filter.  The white card should &quot;disappear&quot; against the green screen.

==Really difficult things to key cleanly==

Try to avoid these things if at all possible:

* Hair, especially if it's moving (e.g. having an actor's/actress' long hair blowing in the wind against a green screen will be a nightmare to work with)

==Does it have to be a green screen?==
No, you can use any colour screen you wish.  Any compositing software worth its place in this world will be able to chroma-key any colour.  Blue and Green are often chosen because the human skin contains very little blue or green pigment. Green screens are often used for shoots outside as sunlight can register on a camera as &quot;blue&quot; causing problems when chroma keying.

==Shooting on video==
* Set the camera to a gain of 0db (this gives the best signal to noise ratio and the widest dynamic range)
* Use a video camera with the least [[w:chroma subsampling|chroma subsampling]] (i.e. 4:4:4 is best).  It is possible to get minimally acceptable results from DV (4:1:1) or HDV (4:2:0) but your life will be easier (and the resulting key considerably better) if you use a higher quality capture medium.  Since keying relies on color information that is disregarded as part of any color space reduction from 4:4:4, all lossy compression formats will result in decreased edge detail.

==Shooting on film==
* Choose a stock with the finest grain posible

=Post-production: pulling a key=

==Tools==
* Serious Magic has a program called Ultra that uses vector keying, rather than chroma keying. 
* Adobe Premiere Pro
* Adobe After Effects
* Autodesk Combustion
* Final Cut Pro/Express (Apple)
* FXhome CompositeLab (Lite and pro) and VisionLab software.
* Wax Invoker

==Introduction==

The [http://www.arri.com/prod/cam/d_20/tech_spec.htm D-20] is ARRI's concept of a practical digital movie camera. Like the [[w:Panavision|Panavision]] Genesis, it uses a single image sensor the same width as a standard 35mm film frame, but unlike the Genesis, this also has the same height as a 35mm frame.

The D-20 uses a custom-designed CMOS sensor rather than the older CCD technology of the Genesis. Instead of the Genesis's RGB stripe filter, the D-20 uses a Bayer Array, similar to that used on digital still cameras. The CMOS sensor's &quot;native resolution&quot; (before the color mask is applied) is 3018 x 2200 pixels, which allows a 1920 x 1080 standard HD output with a resolution similar to the Genesis. Recording can be either on HD Beta tape or a hard disk array.

The D-20 is actually based on a modified ARRIFLEX 435 film camera chassis. It can use any &quot;PL-Mount&quot; cinematography lens, and was specifically designed to be as familiar in operation to a film camera operator as possible. In particular, it retains the rotating mirror shutter/reflex viewfinder that is standard on all ARRI film cameras, which allows the incorporation of a standard optical viewfinder.

This has the advantages that:
* The optical viewfinder image can safely be used for critical focussing, whereas current model electronic viewfinders tend to have insufficent resolution for this.
* No power is needed while setting up a shot, nor is there any particular need for a &quot;video village&quot; of monitoring equipment.
* The camera operator can see outside the frame that is actually being recorded, so (s)he (and/or the focus puller)&quot;can see what's coming&quot;. (A major shortcoming of all-electronic viewfinder systems is the camera operator can only see what is actually being sent out to the recording system).

At present (Oct 2005) the D-20 is still undergoing refinement and to date no commercial projects have been shot with it. It has been observed that ARRI seem far less serious about the D-20 than Panavision do about the Genesis, since the CMOS sensor it is based on was principally designed for use in ARRI's anvanced film scanner, the Arriscan.

==History of the D-20==
Currently, as of during the Sundance Film Festival for 2006, there is only one ArriFlex D-20 located in the United States of America. In about a month from the festival, Arri Rental facilities should have the D-20 available for rent. However, rental prices are still unknown.

==Rental Facilities==
ARRI Rental Germany&lt;br&gt;
ARRI Media London&lt;br&gt;
ARRI-CSC New York&lt;br&gt;
Clairmont Camera, Los Angeles&lt;br&gt;

==Films made with the D-20==
* 1 day's usage on Tim Burton's [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121164/ Corpse Bride (2005)]
* 1 day's use on &quot;Caged&quot; - Short film (UK) [http://www.AEFilms.co.uk Official Site]

===Guiding Principles===

A definitive statement of what constitutes the best combination of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and face-to-face learning experiences is impossible. No such statement exists for the best combination of traditional practices much less for the newer world of blended learning. Singh &amp; Reed (2001) state &quot;Little formal research exists on how to construct the most effective blended program designs&quot; (p. 6). However, observers have begun to collate principles that, at least anecdotally, lead to greater success.

''One note before continuing. Most of the literature about blended learning design comes from work in business training and post-secondary education. The author makes the assumption that those principles are generally applicable to K-12 education as well.''

A theme that emerges is that the instruction methods, whether on-line or face-to-face, are the means, not the end. &quot;Students never learn from technology per se. They learn from the strategies teachers use to communicate effectively through the technologies&quot; (Cyrs, Cyrs, and Conway, 2003, General Guideline #1). It follows that the single most important consideration when designing a blended learning environment is the learning objective or purpose. It is tempting to assert that it is the &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; consideration. However, not only would that lead to this exposition being overly brief, as desirable as that might be for writer and reader alike, it would also mean ignoring the essential truth that all learning occurs in and is shaped by a context. Important dimensions of this context include (Singh &amp; Reed, 2001, p. 5):

:*'''Audience.''' What do the learners know and how varied is their level of knowledge? Are the learners geographicaly centralized or geographicaly dispersed? Are the learners here because they wish to be or because they have to be?
:*'''Content.''' Some content lends itself well to on-line situations. Other content, a complex and detailed procedure for assembling a valve train, for example, may work best in face-to-face setting.
:*'''Infrastructure.''' If physical space is limited, more of the instruction could be placed on-line. If students do not have access to high band width connections, on-line video streaming would be a poor choice.


With purpose and context in mind, the designer can select, combine, and organize different elements of on-line and traditional instruction. Carman (2002) identifies five such elements calling them key &quot;ingredients&quot; (p. 2):

#'''Live events.''' These are synchronous, instructor-led events. Traditional lectures, video conferences, and synchronous chat sessions such as elluminate are examples.
#'''Self-Paced Learning.''' Experiences the learner completes individually on her own time such as an internet or CD-ROM based tutorial.
#'''Collaboration.''' Learners communicate and create with others, e-mail, threaded discussions, and, come to think of it, this wiki are all examples.
#'''Assessment.''' Measurements of learners' mastery of the objectives. Assessment is not limited to conventional tests, quizzes, and grades. Narrative feedback, portfolio evaluations and, importantly, a designers reflection about a blended learning environments effectiveness or usefulness are all forms of assessment.
#'''Support Materials.''' These include reference material, both physical and virtual, FAQ forums, and summaries. Anything that aids learning retention and transfer.


It is useful, though ultimately reductive, to think of the interaction between context and ingredients for a given learning objective as a rectangular matrix. The intersections suggest the method the designer should use. The danger of this metaphor is the suggestion that each purpose, context, and ingredient combination deterministically lead to a matching method. Such is not the case. The point to the designer is to think in terms of those conditions, and others unique to her particular circumstance, as she orchestrates learning activities and creates her blended environment.

McCracken and Dobson (2004) provide an example of how learning purpose, context, and blended learning ingredients lead particular learning methods. They propose a process with &quot;five main design activities&quot; (p.491) as a framework for designing blended learning courses. The process is illustrated with a case study of the redesign of a class at The University of Alberta called Philosophy 101 (pp. 494 - 495):

*'''Identifying learning and teaching principles.''' The teaching and learning goals were described as requiring active participation, sustained discussion, and, most importantly, inquiry and critical analysis.
*'''Describing organizational contexts''' Team teaching with three professors and up to eleven graduate teaching assistants to engage a class of 250 students in dialogue around ethical and political philosophy.
*'''Describing discipline-specific factors''' The designers are described as being concerned about stereotypes of philosophy as &quot;bearded men professing absolute truths&quot; (p.495). The desire was to represent philosophy as an activity, not a set truths to be absorbed.
*'''Selecting and situating appropriate learning technologies''' Learning activities focused on the process of engagement: presenting and defending a thesis and responding to opposing views. For example, a face-to-face lecture would feature contemporary ethical dilemmas with newspaper headlines or a video clip. Or, the instructors would stage a debate in which they would assume the role of a philosopher under study and then argue from the philosopher's point of view. Online threaded discussion supplemented small group seminar sections.
*'''Articulating the complementary interaction between classroom and online learning activities''' In the Philosophy 101 example, it was noted how the face-to-face engagement was complemented by more deliberative, asynchronous discourse.


Even this simplified description illustrates the multilayered, multifaceted nature of blended learning environments. With such a large canvass, the most important design principle might be to start small. &quot;Creating a blended learning strategy is an evolutionary process.&quot; (Singh and Reed, 2001). A good place to begin is to supplement an existing conventional, environment with one or two on-line activities, a resource website or an asynchronous discussion for example. As experience and confidence are gained, new tools can be introduced and a greater effort put into redesigning the program. It is hoped that this chapter will help teachers reach that goal.

__NOTOC__

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Purpose and Overview==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Make a brief statement about the purpose of this specific guide you're making in this section. Briefly describe what the experiment is about. Which scientific principles does it demonstrate?

Replace the guiding test in the template as your write, but keep the egneral structure and leave the text in empty sections so other contributors will know what it is intended for.

Remember that no copyrighted material can be added to this book without the authors explicit accept and please ackowledge sources of information and ideas with links to websites and references.

Media files should be uploaded on &lt;nowiki&gt;[[commons:scienceshow| Wikimedia Commons ScienceShow]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Status for this guide: Finished, Not yet finished, Check recipes...(leave the appropriate)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Subjects relating to this guide: add appropriate...[[../Nanotechnology/]], [[../Physics/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Safety==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Safety Class===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Choose a fitting safety class for this description

&lt;nowiki&gt;*'''Too dangerous!''' (We do not make this experiment because …)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Very dangerous (Should only be attempted after careful training)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Dangerous - Please be aware of this or the other thing... (Untrained people can do this experiment under supervision and guidance)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Harmless (The most dangerous thing is this insignificant little petitesse)&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;===Required Safety Equipment===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*The show performer: Glasses / Lab coat / Nothing / Fire extinguisher / Wet towel and a bucket of water / Eye flushing bottle &lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Audience/participants: Safety screens / Hearing protection (a finger in the ear is often a help).&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;==Materials==&lt;/nowiki&gt;


You'll need the following - make a list

&lt;nowiki&gt;* item 1: formula, CAS number, supplier [http://www.someshop.com], Safety issues (describe the most important ones), Storage, link to safety datasheet&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Procedure==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Preparation time&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Performance time&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Clean-up time.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Step by step===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;#Start by…&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;#…&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;#End with explaining how to properly get rid of waste products&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;===Alternative methods===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Other ways to do the experiment


&lt;nowiki&gt;===Dangers===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Now the reader knows the experiment, give a closer description of possible dangers.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Important, be aware of…&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Consider the…&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;===Other Factors===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

What other things can sometimes affect the result of the experiment. Maybe the humidity or cleanliness of the glass ware is an issue.

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Show notes===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

What to consider when preparing. How to make it more spectacular. What can be difficult to achieve 'on stage' that normally is easy when practising.

What other experiments are good to that have in relation to this one?

What should you beware of that can make the experiment boring?

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Explanation==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;===What's taking place===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Here you can give a more quantitative and mathematical description of what happens. What fundamental laws are involved or demonstrated by this experiment etc. Remember to explain jargon/expressions from the laboratory.

&lt;nowiki&gt;===In the real world===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Do you meet things like this in daily life - give examples!

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Unanswered Questions===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Things we do not yet know and should find an answer to - maybe how it actually works etc.


&lt;nowiki&gt;==More Information==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*[http://end.net Websites with more info] the end.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Acknowledgements===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;===References===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

See &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes Wikipedia:Footnotes]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; example reference &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Remember==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This is just a guide and it can contain both errors and omissions. Always make experiments in small versions before proceeding to larger quantities where things could become dangerous. Ask around if you have any doubts before starting and do not start on a procedure you do not feel you understand and is qualified to perform.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This guide is for configuring your computer to enable reading and writing [[w:Malayalam language|Malayalam]] in Windows, and GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems.

== Microsoft Windows ==
=== Configuring for reading ===
#Delete any old version of [http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/fonts/AnjaliOldLipi.ttf AnjaliOldLipi] Font from Fonts directory which is often C:\WINDOWS\Fonts or C:\WINNT\Fonts.
#Download and copy [http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/fonts/AnjaliOldLipi.ttf AnjaliOldLipi.ttf] to Windows\Fonts folder.
#Click Start, Control Panel, Internet Options, Fonts. Select Language Script Malayalam. Then select Web page font as [http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/fonts/AnjaliOldLipi.ttf AnjaliOldLipi]. Press OK and OK.

=== Configuring for Writing ===

'''Varamozhi'''
[http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net Varamozhi] Editor is a transliteration based Malayalam text Editor that runs on both Windows and Unix. That is, you can type in Manglish and you will see in real Malayalam.
[[Image:Malayalam-Mozhi-Lipi.png|frame|left|Basic Mozhi Transliteration Scheme]]
Also, you can copy-paste any Malayalam article from some web site and that will be converted back to Manglish for correction, further editing or conversion to Unicode or another font.

=== Language packs ===
You can install the Malayalam language pack for your operating system to see the Microsoft Windows GUI in Malayalam.

== GNU/Linux and *BSD*s ==
* All latest GNU/Linux distributions support Malayalam well. You may need to follow specific installation guides  from  [http://smc.org.in Swathanthra malayalam Computing] to configure it well
* You can see a how to to enable malayalam in your computer @ the [http://malayalam.web4all.in Malayalam Computing Portal]

Here are the steps to enable support.
* pango enabled firefox does provide good indic fonts support.In [http://debian.org/ Debian GNU/Linux] Iceweasel provides the best indic rendition.You can enable Gnome browser epiphany for pango support via gconf2 tool as epiphany also is based on gecko.
 
* If your distribution does not come with any indic font(here,Malayalam), you will need to install one.

=== Installing Font in Gnome,Kde and X in general ===

* Download [http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/smc/fonts/malayalam-fonts-04/ Malayalam Unicode fonts]] and copy it to fonts:/// Directory

* All major distributions comes with malayalam fonts. Use apt-get install ttf-malayalam-fonts in Debian based distributions(Debian Ubuntu etc ) and yum install smc-fonts in fedora

===In Gnome===
'''[http://www.gnome.org GNOME]''' is a versatile Desktop Environment with native pango support which means better rendering in-built.
*In Gnome,drag n drop your font to nautilus window.before,nautilus should be in Fonts:/// directory(press CTRL+L,enter fonts:/// ).
Now press CTRL+ALT+BKSPACE to restart X and gdm.next time the font is available for local user and installed in ~/.fonts/ directory.

=== Installing TrueType fonts in X in general and also for Gnome ===

*there are other ways to make font available to all users of the system in Gnome or X itself.I am taking Debian/Ubuntu as example,but works for any distro too.for redhat/fedora and Suse or most distros this works.rpm based distros got a tool called [http://www.dinakaran.com/fonts/linux/ chkfontpath] which is very useful.
Now,you need to use CLI or terminal for implementing this.firstly:
 &quot;apt-get install ttmkfdir&quot; 
using apt package management  tool or use Synaptic Manager.
make a directory called malayalam and copy the Anjali font to there.
 :~#  mkdir /usr/share/fonts/truetype/malayalam/
 move the font here.
then go to /usr/share/fonts/truetype/malayalam/  -where font is installed.
You need to be root user for installing fonts globally.for that in a terminal,
su [press enter]
&lt;give your root password&gt;
or 
sudo  [press enter]
&lt;give your local password&gt;
sudo is used in Ubuntu Linux by default.

then as root(&quot;~#&quot; stands for root prompt,dont copy that),
 ~#ttmkfdir&gt; fonts.scale
 ~#mkfontscale
 ~#ttmkfdir &gt;fonts.dir
 ~#mkfontdir
 ~#xset fp+ /usr/share/fonts/truetype/malayalam/
 ~#xset fp rehash
now do a,
 ~#fc-cache -fv
restart Display(X) or reboot.As /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ directory is already mapped in Xorg for fonts.(see /etc/X11/fs/config).
Now the font can be used by every users.

=== Kde Desktop Environment ===
Kde is the most used Desktop Environment in GNU/Linux and *NIX's too:
* In KDE Control Center (kcontrol), select System Administration -&gt; Font Installer, and add the downloaded font
* You may need to logout and login back

*For Transliteration or manglish(type malayalam in English) in GNU/Linux and *BSDs,we can use a various inputs systems [http://smc.org.in Swanalekha] (Phonetic Keyboard using SCIM) or [http://smc.org.in mozhi]. otherwise you can compile from source the [http://varamozhi.wikia.com/wiki/Varamozhi Varamozhi] Transliteration tool for Malayalam.

=== Download Packages to Enable malayalam support in GNU/Linux ===
You can download the software required to enable Malayalam support in the latest version of Ubuntu(7.10) and Debian GNU/Linux (etch) from http://malayalam.kerala.gov.in

Use the repositories of Swathanthra Malayalam Computing to keep updated. Swathanthra Malayalam Computing manages repositories for Fedora 6, 7, 8, 9 , CentOS5 and Debain etch, lenny and sid

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the 50,000 years since humans successfully settled the world's habitable continents, a long story emerges of environmental stimuli and human response.  Innovation, migration, settlement, development of material culture are likely responses, but result in landscape modification. The modern human world is the culmination of these stimuli-response iterations.  

Earth processes create regions of climate, landforms, soils, vegetation, and other resources.  Variations in human population distributions coincide with all possible permutations of physical environmental factors.  These permutations are not randomly distributed. A property of geographical distributions is that similarity amongst features is directly related to their proximity.  

Thus human population distribution is not random.  It is the result of human exploration and expansion to lands suitable for supporting a population.  Conversely stated, it is the slow culmination of individual and group decisions to choose habitats suitable for survival, and secondarily, for comfort.

{{Guide to UNIX:clink|chmod|1|s=changes file mode|bsds=yes|lq=yes|coreutils=81}}

'''chmod''' changes permissions of files. One must be familiar with Unix file permissions to understand this command. There are three permissions: read (&quot;r&quot;), write (&quot;w&quot;), and execute (&quot;x&quot;). There are three sets of permissions: for the owning user of the file (&quot;u&quot;), for the group of the file (&quot;g&quot;), and for other users (&quot;o&quot;).

For a file, &quot;execute&quot; means to run it as a program. For a directory, &quot;execute&quot; permission is required to use anything in that directory tree, so doing anything with &quot;/usr/share/doc/README&quot; requires execute permissions on all of &quot;/&quot;, &quot;/usr&quot;, &quot;/usr/share&quot;, and &quot;/usr/share/doc&quot;.

If you are interested in more advanced topics like the set-uid, set-gid, sticky bits and octal numbers, try reading the FreeBSD manual page at http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi (type &quot;chmod&quot; in the form and submit).

We wrote a shell script called &quot;configure&quot;. We make it executable (&quot;+x&quot;) and then execute it as a command. Usually, &quot;+x&quot; is the same as &quot;u+x&quot; or &quot;ug+x&quot;, depending on the status of the ''file mode creation mask''.
 &gt; chmod +x configure
 &gt; ./configure

Only allow the owning user to run &quot;configure&quot;:
 &gt; chmod u+x configure

Deny the group and other users from running &quot;configure&quot;:
 &gt; chmod go-x configure

For all users except the owner (&quot;gw&quot;), disable all access to &quot;~/mail&quot; and &quot;~/private&quot; (&quot;-rwx&quot;). This way, the contents are private and only their owner (or root) can access them.
 &gt; chmod go-rwx ~/mail ~/private

Note that in the previous example, &quot;-R&quot; was not specified. By disabling the execute bit (&quot;-x&quot;), all files inside ~/{mail,private} are protected even if their group and other read bits are enabled. Thus, simply moving some file from inside ~/{mail,private} to some public place like &quot;/tmp&quot; can make the files available to other users again.

The &quot;root&quot; user wants to set up &quot;/usr/local/src&quot; so that all users in group &quot;wsrc&quot; (including &quot;tux&quot;) can create files there. Root will continue to own the directory. This is done by changing the group of &quot;/usr/local/src&quot; to &quot;wsrc&quot; and then by granting to the group (&quot;g&quot;) the read, write, and execute permissions (&quot;+rwx&quot;).
 &gt; chown :wsrc /usr/local/src
 &gt; chmod g+rwx /usr/local/src

All Unix-like systems should allow all users to create temporary files in &quot;/tmp&quot; and &quot;/var/tmp&quot;. Thus root gives everyone (&quot;a&quot;, short for &quot;ugo&quot;) all permissions (&quot;+rwx&quot;) on the files.
 &gt; chmod a+rwx /tmp /var/tmp

The problem with the above is that because all users have write access to /tmp and /var/tmp, every user can delete and rename files, even ones not created by them. For example, &quot;tux&quot; could create &quot;/tmp/socket.3908&quot; and another user could delete it or rename it to &quot;/tmp/garbage&quot;, thus annoying Tux. To keep temporary files safe, we use the ''sticky bit'' called &quot;t&quot;. This limits the deletion and renaming of files in /tmp to root, the owner of /tmp (also root), and the owner of the file (Tux for &quot;/tmp/socket.3908&quot;). It does the same for /var/tmp. So what we should do is:
 &gt; chmod a+rwxt /tmp /var/tmp

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__

== Connectors and non-connectors == 

Words are made of letters of different kinds.
*Letters are split into two groups:
**Connectors
**Non-connectors
*Every Connector letter will connect to the next letter in a word.
;Example

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـ ـت &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـت&lt;/font&gt;

:Notice that &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt; (baa) is connected to the next letter. This is because baa is a connector, not because the next letter is one.

;Another example:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ه &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; م &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; هـ ـتـ ـم &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; هـتـم
&lt;/font&gt;

:Notice that &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ه &lt;/font&gt; is connected to &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt; is connected to &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; م &lt;/font&gt;.

The above examples also show letters changing form in order to connect. Example:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ه&lt;/font&gt; (haa-single form) became&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; هـ &lt;/font&gt;(haa-initial form), they are both the same letter, but in different forms, so they can be handwritten together. But how do we know which form a letter is supposed to take on in a word?

==Connectors only==

When a word only has connector letters, then the following applies:
*The first letter is in the  initial form.
*The final letter is in the final form.
*All other letters are in the middle form.

;Example

:So if you had to connect five letters of the letter &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt; (taa) together...

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt;

:...then the first letter would be in the  initial form (i.e. &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; تـ &lt;/font&gt;), the last letter would be in the final form (i.e.&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ـت&lt;/font&gt;). So:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; تـ &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ... &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ـت &lt;/font&gt;

:All other letters would be in the middle form (i.e.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ـتـ &lt;/font&gt;).

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; تـ   ـتـ   ـتـ   ـتـ   ـت &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; تــتــتــتــت &lt;/font&gt;

;Another example

: How to write: &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ه &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; م &lt;/font&gt; ? 

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـ &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; (baa  initial form) &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ـهـ &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; (haa middle form) &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ه &lt;/font&gt;

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ـم &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; (meem final form) &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; م &lt;/font&gt;

:So the word becomes:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ه &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; م &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـ  ـهـ  ـم &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـهـم &lt;/font&gt;

:That is how it looks when it is all connected properly. That is how Arabic words are written.

== With non-connectors ==

The non-connector letters are: &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ا   د   ذ   ر   ز   و&lt;/font&gt;

*Non-connectors only have 2 forms
*#Being connected - used if the previous letter is a connector
*#Unconnected - used otherwise (if the previous letter is a non-connector, or if there is no previous letter)
*Because non-connectors do not connect to letters after them they create breaks in words.

In the next examples, an ampersand (this symbol &amp;) will be used to show where one letter does not connect to the next one (where the breaks are) in the following example. The breaks always occur directly after the non-connector.

;Example:

:Write in Arabian script: b-b-b-r-b-b

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;

:First find out where the break is:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;

:Let's do the first part (the part on the right of the ampersand &quot;&amp;&quot;). We know that the first letter &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;(baa) should be in the  initial form. The last letter is a non-connector. Which form should it be in? Because the letter before it is a connector, this letter &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ر &lt;/font&gt;(raa) should be in connected form:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـ   ـبـ   ـبـ   ـر &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـبـبـر &lt;/font&gt;

:This was only the first written part of the word. We have to do the part after the non-connector letter.

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـ ـب &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـب&lt;/font&gt;

:Now we have to have the parts side by side to make the word.

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـبـبـربـب&lt;/font&gt;

:Technical note: Although there is a break between the letter &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ر&lt;/font&gt; (raa) and the next letter when it is written by hand, when one word in Arabic is typed the space bar is never touched. The letters automatically get connected properly by the computer.

;Another example

:Now let's do an actual Arabic word.

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ك &lt;/font&gt;

:First find out where the breaks are:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/font&gt; ك &lt;/font&gt;

:In the first part, we see that the first letter is a connector and it is not the only letter, so we know automatically that it should be in  initial form. We noticed that &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ر &lt;/font&gt;is a non-connector. The letter before it (i.e. &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt;) is a connector, so&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ر &lt;/font&gt;should be written in connected form.

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; تـ &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ـر &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; تر&lt;/font&gt;

:The second part is just one letter so it should be written in single form which it already has:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ك &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; ك&lt;/font&gt;

:Put them side by side.

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ترك&lt;/font&gt; &amp;nbsp; (transliteration: t-r-k)

:This is an Arabic word meaning: he left (something). It is pronounced (ta-re-ka).

With practice, you will be able to write better and better. In the near future, some exercises will be added.

= Inference Rules =

== Overview ==

Inference rules will be formated as in the following example.

: Conditional Elimination (CE)
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The name of this inference rule is 'Conditional Elimination', which can be abbreviated as 'CE'.  We can apply this rule if formulae having the forms above the line appear as active lines in the derivation.  These are called the ''antecedent lines'' for this inference.  Applying the rule adds a formula having the form below the line.  This is called the ''consequent line'' for this inference.  The annotation for the newly derived line will be the line numbers of the antecedent lines and the abbreviation 'CE'.

Note.  You might see ''premise line'' and ''conclusion line'' for ''antecedent line'' and ''consequent line''.  You may see other terminology as well.  Most textbooks avoid giving any special terminology here; they just leave it up to the classroom teaching assistant to make it up as they go.

Each sentential connective will have two inference rules, one each of the following types.

* An ''introduction rule''.  The introduction rule for a given connective allows us to derive a formula having the given connective as its main connective.

* An ''elimination rule''.  The elimination rule for a given connective allows us to use a formula already appearing in the derivation having the given connective as its main connective.

Three rules (Negation Introduction, Negation Elimination, and Conditional Introduction) will be deferred to a later page.  These are so-called discharge rules which will be explained when we get to subderivations.

Three rules (Conjunction Elimination, Disjunction Introduction, and Biconditional Elimination) will have two forms each.  We somewhat arbitrarily count the two patterns as forms of the same rule rather than separate rules.

The validity of the inferences on this page can be shown by truth table.

== Inference rules ==

=== Negation ===

Negation Introduction (NI)
: ''Deferred to a later page.''


Negation Elimination (NE)
: ''Deferred to a later page.''

=== Conjunction ===

Conjunction Introduction (KI)
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \quad \quad \ \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \land \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Conjunction Introduction traditionally goes by the name ''Adjunction'' or ''Conjunction''.


Conjunction Elimination, Form I (KE)

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Conjunction Elimination, Form II (KE)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{(\varphi \land \psi)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Conjunction Elimination traditionally goes by the name ''Simplification''.

=== Disjunction ===

Disjunction Introduction, Form I (DI)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \quad \quad \ \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Disjunction Introduction, Form II (DI)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \quad \quad \ \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Disjunction Introduction traditionally goes by the name ''Addition''.


Disjunction Elimination (DE)
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \lor \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \chi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{(\psi \rightarrow \chi)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\chi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Disjunction Elimination traditionally goes by the name ''Separation of Cases''.

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Conditional Elimination traditionally goes by the Latin name ''Modus Ponens'' or, less often, by ''Affirming the Antecedent''.

=== Biconditional ===

Biconditional Introduction (BI)
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{(\psi \rightarrow \varphi)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Biconditional Elimination, Form I (BE)
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Biconditional Elimination, Form II (BE)
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

Inference rules are easy enough to apply.  From the lines

: (1) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{S} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{T})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and 

: (2) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we can add to a derivation

: (3) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The annotation will be the line numbers of (1) and (2) and the abbreviation for Conditional Elimination, namely 'CE'.  The order of the antecedent lines does not matter.  The inference is allowed if (1) appears before (2); it is also allowed if (2) appears before (1).

It must be remembered that inference rules are strictly syntactical.  Semantically obvious variations is not allowed.  It is not allowed, for example, to derive (3) from (1) and

: (4) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

However, you can get from (1) and (4) to (3) by first deriving

: (5) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and

: (6) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

by Conjunction Elimination (KE).  Then you can derive (2) by Conjunction Introduction (KI) and finally (3) from (1) and (2) by Conditional Elimination (CE) as before.  Some derivation systems have a rule, often called Tautological Implication, allowing you to derive any tautological consequence of previous lines.  However, this should be seen as an (admittedly useful) abbreviation.  On later pages, we will implement a restricted version of this abbreviation.

It is generally useful to apply break down premises, other assumptions (to be introduced on a later page) by applying elimination rules&amp;mdash;and then continue breaking down the results.  Supposing that is why we applied CE to (1) and (2), it will likely be useful to derive

: (7) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S} \rightarrow \mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and

: (8) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T} \rightarrow \mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

by applying Biconditional Elimination (BE) to (3).  To further break this down, you might then attempt to derive &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; so that you can apply CE to (7) or (8).

If you know what line you want to derive, you can build it up by applying introduction rules.  That was the strategy for deriving (2) from (5) and (6).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Writing Optimal Exporters and Importers for Blender:Python==
If you are starting out in writing a script, don't take these guidelines too seriously, its worth getting things working and then sight a need for optimization before you begin to look for areas to optimize your script.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you're making a tool for others, keep in mind that they might use it with larger datasets than those you have been testing with. So before releasing it can be good time to try to optimize.

For more generic python performance tips see http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips

==Getting Objects (Exporting/General Blender)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;Blender.Object.Get()&lt;/tt&gt; is often used to get all objects for exporting. This is bad practice since &lt;tt&gt;Object.Get()&lt;/tt&gt; will return objects from every scene in Blender, this is almost never what the user wants and could result in overlapping data, but also could take a long time if the user has 2 or more large scenes consuming a lot of memory.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Instead use &lt;tt&gt;Blender.Scene.GetCurrent().getChildren()&lt;/tt&gt; This returns all objects from the current scene.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Another alternative is to use &lt;tt&gt;Blender.Object.GetSelected()&lt;/tt&gt; which returns selected objects on visible layers in the current scene.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Getting Mesh data (Exporting Only)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Meshes are not just thin wrappers like most of the other Types in
Blender so you want to avoid &lt;tt&gt;meshObject.getData()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;meshObject.data&lt;/tt&gt; as much as possible, its best practice only calling each mesh data once.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To get the name of the data the object references do not use ob.getData().name
simply to get the name of the object.
Instead use &lt;tt&gt;obj.getData(1)&lt;/tt&gt; ... meaning &lt;tt&gt;obj.getData(1=name_only)&lt;/tt&gt;
this is nice because it works for all data types, its just that
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''Note, recently (as of 15/10/05) the addition of the Mesh module (a thin wrapper around Blenders mesh data) means that you can do a &lt;tt&gt;meshObject.getData(mesh=1)&lt;/tt&gt; without the problem NMesh has, however this is new and doesn't support all the NMesh functions.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Use new python functionality mesh.transform() (Exporting Only)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As of Blender 2.37 &lt;tt&gt;nmesh.transform(ob.matrix)&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to transform an NMesh by a 4x4 transformation matrix.
&lt;br&gt;
On my system it is over 100 times faster than transforming each vert's location and normal by a matrix within python. Though the overall speed gained by using this in my obj exporter was about %5.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
make sure that if you are exporting vertex normals add a 1,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;mesh.transfrom(matrix, recalc_normals=1)&lt;/tt&gt;
This avoids un-needed vertex normal transforming.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Beware of python hogging memory. (python generally)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You may ignore this point, for small applications, but I have found that for larger scenes this can become a problem if not allowed for early on.


A List in python (and therefore blender:python) is never deallocated,
however python can re-use the memory whilst the script is running.
Basically making large lists in python and a lot of recursive variable
assignment can leak memory that can only be regained with a restart.
- *If you can- avoid making large lists.

This is Fixed in Python 2.4.1 which will compile with blender.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Lists (Python General)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
===List Lookup===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Python there are some tricky list functions that save you having to search through the list.
&lt;br&gt;
Even though you're not looping on the list data '''python is''', so you need to be aware of functions that will slow down your script by searching the whole list.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
myList.count(listItem)
myList.index(listItem)
myList.remove(listItem)
if listItem in myList: ...
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
The above functions performs a full loop on the list, so if you can avoid using them on large lists, your script will run faster.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Modifying Lists===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In python we can add and remove from a list, This is slower when lists are modified in length at the start of the list, since all the data after the index of modification needs to be moved up or down 1 place.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Of course the most simple way to add onto the end of the list is to use &lt;tt&gt;myList.append(listItem)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;myList.extend(someList)&lt;/tt&gt; and the fastest way to remove an item is &lt;tt&gt;myList.pop()&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To use an index you can use &lt;tt&gt;myList.insert(index, listItem)&lt;/tt&gt; and pop also takes indicies for list removal, but these are slower.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes its faster (but more memory hungry) to just rebuild the list.
&lt;br&gt;
Say we want to remove all triangle faces in a list.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rather then
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
fIdx = len(mesh.faces) # Loop backwards
while fIdx: # While the value is not 0
	fIDx -=1

	if len(mesh.faces[fIDx].v) == 3:
		mesh.pop(fIdx) # Remove the tri
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
It is faster to build a new list with list comprehension.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
mesh.faces = [f for f in mesh.faces if len(f.v) != 3]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Adding list items===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If you have a list that you want to add onto another list, rather then appending in a for loop, use 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;myList.extend([li1, li2...])&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
instead of...
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
for l in someList:
	myList.append(l)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that insert can be used when needed, but it is slower than append especially when inserting at the start of a long list.
&lt;br&gt;This example shows a very suboptimal way of making a reversed list.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
for l in someList:
	myList.insert(0,l)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

===Removing List Items===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Use &lt;tt&gt;myList.pop(i)&lt;/tt&gt; rather then &lt;tt&gt;myList.remove(listItem)&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This requires you to have the index of the list Item but is faster since remove needs to search the list.
&lt;br&gt;
Using pop for removing list items favors a while loops instead of a for loop.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is an example of how to remove items in 1 loop, removing the last items first, which is faster (as explained above)
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
listIndex = len(myList)
while listIndex:
	listIndex -=1
	if myList[listIndex].someTestProperty == 1:
		myList.pop(listIndex)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


A fast way of removing items, where you can mess up the list order, is to swap 2 list items, so the item you remove is always last.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
popIndex = 5

# Swap so the popIndex is last.
myList[-1], myList[popIndex] = myList[popIndex], myList[-1]

# Remove last item (popIndex)
myList.pop()
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
When removing many items in a large list this can provide a good speedup.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Avoid Copying Lists===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When passing a list/dictionary to a function, it is better to have the function modify the list rather then returning a new list.
This means python dosn't need to create a new list in memory.
&lt;br&gt;
Functions that modify a list in their place are more efficient then functions that create new lists.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;normalize(vec)&lt;/tt&gt; faster: no re-assignment
...is faster then.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;vec = normalize(vec)&lt;/tt&gt; slower, only use for functions that are used to make new, unlinked lists.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also be note that passing a sliced list makes a copy of the list in python memory eg..
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;foobar(mylist[4:-1])&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If mylist was a large list of floats, a copy could use a lot of extra memory.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Dictionaries (Python General)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;

==Dict Lookup==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you access a dictionary item, '''someDict['foo']''' A lookup is performed, pythons lookups are very fast, but if your are accessing this data in a loop its better to make a variable that can be referenced faster.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
for key in someDict.keys():
...wip
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
=Strings=

==Pathnames (Exporting)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Blender pathnames are not compatible with path names from other generic python modules.
&lt;br&gt;
python native functions don't understand blenders '''&lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt;''' as being the current file dir in blender and '''&lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;''' to be the current framenumber.
&lt;br&gt;
A common example is where your exporting a scene and want to export the image paths with it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;Blender.sys.expandpath(img.filename)&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Will give you the absolute path, so you can pass the path to functions from other python modules.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Correct string parsing (Import/Exporting)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since many file formats are ASCII, the way you parse/export strings can make a large difference in how fast your program runs.
&lt;br&gt;
When importing strings to make into blender there are a few ways to parse the string.

===Passing String===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Use float(string) rather then eval(string) and if you know the value will be an int then int(string)
float() will work for an int too but its faster if ints are converted as ints.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
===Checking String Start/End===
&lt;blockquote&gt;

If your checking the start of a string for a keyword, use...
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
if line.startswith('vert '):
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
...rather then
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
if line[0:5] == 'vert ':
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Using Startswith is slightly faster (about 5%).
&lt;br&gt;
myString.endswith('foobar') can be used for line endings too.
&lt;br&gt;
Also, if your unsure whether the text is upper or lower case use lower or upper string function.
Eg.
&lt;tt&gt;if line.upper().startswith('VERT ')&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Writing Strings to a File (Python General)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here are 3 ways of joining multiple strings into 1 string for writing
&lt;br&gt;
This really applies to any area of your code that involves a lot of string joining.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Pythons string addition.
Dont use if you can help it, especially in the main data writing loop.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
file.write(str1 + ' ' + str2 + ' ' + str3 + '\n')
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
String formatting. Use this when you're writing string data from floats and int's
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
file.write('%s %s %s\n' % (str1, str2, str3))
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Pythons string joining function. To join a list of strings
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
file.write(' '.join([str1, str2, str3, '\n']))
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
join is fastest on many strings, string formatting is quite fast too (better for converting data types).
And string arithmetic is slowest.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=Other=
==Profile your code (Python General)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Simply timing sections of your code will point you to the part that needs optimizing.
Eg
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
time1 = Blender.sys.time()

for i in range(10):
	x = i*2

print Blender.sys.time() - time1
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Psyco JIT Compiler (Python General)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A python module called psyco exists that can dynamically compile some of python functions.
Most of the speed gains affect algorithms written in python, so importers and exporters have less to gain from them then scripts that deal with 3d math.

For many scripts, a no brainier way of using psyco is to do a.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
import psyco
psyco.full()
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Psyco can also profile your code.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
import psyco
psyco.profile()
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For scripts to be distributed it is polite to try loading psyco to avoid raising an error.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
try:
	import psyco
	psyco.full()
except:
	print 'For optimal performance on an x86 CPU, install psyco'
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that psyco reports to use a lot of system memory, if you run out of ram it may be best not to use psyco.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Use Try/Except Sparingly==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The try function is useful to save time writing code to check a condition,
&lt;br&gt;
However 'try' is about 10 times slower then 'if', so dont use 'try' in areas of your code that execute in a loop that runs many times (1000's or more).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are cases where using 'try' is faster than checking wether the condition will raise an error, so it is worth experimenting.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Python Objects==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
===Use &quot;is&quot; instead of &quot;==&quot; ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In some cases &quot;is&quot; can be used instead of &quot;==&quot; for comparison, &quot;is not&quot; for &quot;!=&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;==&quot; Checks whether the 2 variables are the same value, where as &quot;is&quot; tests that the python object is the same, shares the same memory - are both an instance of the same object. (Python Object, not Blender a Object)
&lt;br&gt;
The advantage of using &quot;is&quot; is that its faster since it dosent need to compare as much data.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is a benchmark test that compares a python class and a blender vector- one the same and one different.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
from Blender import *

print '\n\nStarting benchmark.'

# Test class
class a:
        pass

class1 = a()
class2 = a()
vec1 = Mathutils.Vector(1,2,3)
vec2 = Mathutils.Vector(1,2,4)

f = 400000

t = sys.time()
for i in range(f):
        class1 is class1
        class1 is class2
        vec1 is vec1
        vec1 is vec2
print ' Is Banchmark %.6f' % (sys.time() - t)


t = sys.time()
for i in range(f):
        class1 == class1
        class1 == class2
        vec1 == vec1
        vec1 == vec2

print ' == Benchmark %.6f' % (sys.time() - t)
print 'Done\n'
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
My Computer showed the following results. I should do more tests- but this is representative of other tests.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
Starting benchmark.
 Is Banchmark 0.284363
 == Benchmark 3.367173
Done
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The same test with vec1, vec2, class1, class2 as ints and floats.
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;is&quot; still faster.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
Starting benchmark.
 Is Banchmark 0.272853
 == Benchmark 0.322123
Done
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Logical form ==

We will not try to explain fully what ''logical form'' is.  Both natural languages such as English and logical languages such as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; exhibit logical form.  A primary purpose of a logical language is to make the logical form explicit by having it correspond directly with the grammar.  In the context of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, a logical form is indicated by a metalogical expression containing no sentence letters but containing metalogical variables (in our convention, Greek letters).  A single formula can have several logical forms of varying degrees of explicitness or granularity.  For example, the formula &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P^0_0} \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \rightarrow \mathrm{R^0_0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has the following three logical forms:

: &lt;math&gt;((\phi \land \psi) \rightarrow \chi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\phi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, the first of these is the most explicit or fine-grained.

We say that a formula is an ''instance'' of a logical form.  For example, the formula &lt;math&gt;(\phi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has, among many others, the following instances.

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P^0_0} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q^0_0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P^0_0} \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \rightarrow \mathrm{R^0_0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P^0_0} \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \rightarrow (\mathrm{Q^0_0} \lor \mathrm{R^0_0}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Formal semantics ==

The formal semantics for a formal language such as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; goes in two parts.

* Rules for specifying an interpretation.  An ''interpretation'' assigns semantic values to the non-logical symbols of a formal syntax.  The semantics for a formal language will specify what range of vaules can be assigned to which class of non-logical symbols.  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has only one class of non-logical symbols, so the rule here is particularly simple.  An interpretation for a sentential language is a ''valuation'', namely an assignment of truth values to sentence letters. In predicate logic, we will encounter interpretations that include other elements in addition to a valuation.

* Rules for assigning semantic values to larger expressions of the language.  For sentential logic, these rules assign a truth value to larger formulae based on truth values assigned to smaller formulae.For more complex syntaxes (such as for predicate logic), values are assigned in a more complex fashion.

An ''extended valuation'' assigns truth values to the molecular formulae of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (or similar sentential language) based on a valuation.  A valuation for sentence letters is extended by a set of rules to cover all formulae.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If an English word has a silent letter, that letter does not count. Think about the sound, not the English spelling when doing this exercise.

==Reference==
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;م &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''m'' ''' in '' '''m'''ap'' and '' '''m'''ai'''m''' ''
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ك &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''k'' ''' in ''brea'''k''' '', ''ca'''k'''e'', and ''Ric'''k''' ''
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ي &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''j'' ''' in ''f'''j'''ord'' and ''' ''y'' ''' in '' '''y'''ellow'' (not the ''' ''y'' ''' in ''s'''y'''stem'')
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ث &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''th'' ''' in '' '''th'''ink'' and ''ba'''th''' ''
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ف &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''f'' ''' in '' '''f'''ate''
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ت &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''t'' ''' in '' '''t'''alk'' and ''ba'''t''' ''
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ب &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''b'' ''' in '' '''b'''reak'' and ''ca'''b''' ''

==Exercise 1==
Instructions: Write the Arabic letter that represents the sound that the English word starts with.
examples:

*think &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;   ث&lt;/font&gt;
*face  &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ف&lt;/font&gt;

Begin:

#king
#hate
#father
#hamper
#mass
#mother
#yacht
#matter
#clan
#master
#Yemen
#coat
#match
#foremost
#boot
#first
#taste
#cave
#banner
#third
#mom
#track
#cast
#thistle
#main
#fate
#base
#yes
#captain

==Exercise 2==
Instructions: Write the Arabic letter that represents the sound of the English sound that the English word ends in.
Because fate ends in the &quot;t&quot; sound, write &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt;(taa) beside the word.
Examples:
*fate  &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ت &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*fat  &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*bluff &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ف&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

= Jaenisch Gambit =
===3...f5===

:The Jaenisch Gambit or sometimes called the Schliemann Defence is an attack on the center pawns general leads to open and complex play. Accepting the gambit is rare at master level, due to a line which can lead to repetition of position.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: excercise → exercise using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If an English word has a silent letter, that letter does not count. Think about the sound, not the English spelling when doing this exercise.

==Reference==
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;د &lt;/font&gt;is used to write the &quot;d&quot;-&quot;data,dog&quot;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ذ &lt;/font&gt;is used to write the &quot;dh&quot; sound such as the &quot;th&quot; in &quot;this&quot;,  &quot;there&quot;, and &quot;bathe&quot;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ث &lt;/font&gt;is used to write &quot;th&quot;-&quot;think, bath&quot;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ر &lt;/font&gt;is used to write the &quot;r&quot; sound, the Arabic sound is different though (it is a &quot;rolled r&quot; sound).
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ز &lt;/font&gt;is used to write the &quot;z&quot; sound-&quot;zebra, zoo,oz&quot; 
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ف &lt;/font&gt;is used to write &quot;f&quot;-&quot;fate&quot;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ب &lt;/font&gt;is used to write &quot;b&quot;-&quot;break,cab&quot;

==Excercise 1==
Instructions: Write the Arabic letter that represents the sound that the English word starts with.
examples:

*think &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;   ث&lt;/font&gt;
*face  &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ف&lt;/font&gt;

==Excercise 2==
Instructions: Write the Arabic letter that represents the sound of the English sound that the English word ends in.

Examples:
*fate  &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ت &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*fat  &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Achondroplasia is a common nonlethal form of chondrodysplasia. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance. De novo mutations cause 75-80% of cases. The mutation rate is estimated to be 0.000014 per gamete per generation. Cardinal features include short stature, rhizomelic shortening of the arms and legs, a disproportionately long trunk, trident hands, midfacial hypoplasia, prominent forehead (frontal bossing), thoracolumbar gibbus, true megalencephaly, and caudal narrowing of the interpedicular spaces.

==Etiology==
Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disease due to mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Most cases are due to sporadic mutations. Advanced paternal age is a risk factor.


In achondroplasia, there is a decrease in endochondral ossification, with a smaller zone of proliferating chondrocytes. Periosteal ossification, however, is not affected.

The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors are very important in cells growth and differentiation. The mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) result in many genetic disease. Achondroplasia is one of the most common forms of human dwarfism; it is also associated with the mutation in the FGFR3. 
The activation of tyrosine kinase receptors is created by two main steps. The first step is the binding of FGFs to their receptors cause the receptors to aggregate, forming adimer. In the second step, the tyrosine kinase is activated by the eggregation from step one; the phosphorylation will occurs between the tyrosine kinase and its neighbors, phosphates are added to tyrosine on the tail of the other polypeptide. The signal will be initiated; the protein is now activated. One tyrosine kinase receptor dimmer will be able to activate ten or more different intracellular proteins simultanteous. There are three main signals. The first one is the activation of the ras G protein and the MAP kinase cascade to signal to the transcription DNA. The second one is the activation of phospholipase C to make the separation of PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. The third signal is the phosphorylation of Stat1 transcription and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus. In the activation of the FGFRs, heparin has been found to have effects on the biding of FGFs to their receptors. It will help the FGFs binding together as a web and link to their receptors. 
	There are many types of FGFRs in human body and also there will bee many types of FGFRs mutation in our body. In this article, there are three first FGFRs introduced such as: mutations in FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3. Mutation in FGFR1 can cause the Pfeiffer Syndrome, a malformation syndrome, leads to the abnormal of skull and facial shape. Mutation in FGFR2 may cause three different type of syndrome such as Crouzon Syndrome, Jackson-Weiss Syndrome and Apert Syndrome. Mutation in FGFR3 can give Achondroplasia or Thanatophoric Dysplasia. The most common forms of achondroplasia are found with a very high percentage (97%) specific to FGFR3 mutation in the transmembrane of the receptors. In a normal condition of the transmembrane region of the protein, Glycine amino acid is found on DNA at the position 380. But in the mutation FGFR3, there is the absence of glycine; and at that location, there is an appearance of arginine. This is the results of a genetic mutation of glycine to arginine. 
	The achondroplasia is caused by the mutation in FGFR3 as the “gained-of-function” mutation because the FGFRs gain their activeness. Usually, the binding of the FGF to the FGFRs will help the FGFRS becoming more active. But in the mutations of FGFRs, the FGFRs are able to be more active without binding to the FGF ligands. The FGFRs has been gain the function of the Stat1 transcription factor and its subsequent translocation into nucleus. This is the third type of signaling. Under the effects of gaining the function of Stat1 transcription factor, the more signaling of this function is the more the cell cycle is limited and inhibited, leads to the cell growth arrest. This is how “gain-of-function-mutation” affects the growth of the affected individual.
	The FGFRs and FGFs relate to achondroplasia as the mutation in FGFR3. Furthermore, the mutation in FGFRs is responsible to many diseases. FGFs and FGFRs have an important position in cell growth and differentiation.

==Clinical Features==
Achondroplasia causes proximal shortening of the limbs, short stature, relatively enlarged head with frontal bossing, and a depressed nasal bridge. The thorax is long and narrow, and is accompanied by thoracolumbar kyphosis. There is tilting of the sacrum with associated exaggeration of the lumbar lordosis. Affected individuals are of normal intelligence. Homozygous mutations are rare, and usually affect children of two affected parents. In this case, the features of the disease are more severe, and usually causes death early in life.


Communicating hydrocephalus and spinal stenosis can occur. 

==Radiologic Findings==
A skeletel survey is useful to confirm the diagnosis of achondroplasia. Skull films demonstrate a large skull with a narrow foramen magnum, and relatively small skull base. The vertabral bodies are short and cuboidal, and there is congenitally narrowed spinal canal. The iliac wings are small and squared, with a narrow sciatic notch. The tubular bones are short and thick with metaphyseal cupping and flaring and irregular growth plates. Fibular overgrowth is present. The hand is broad with short metacarpals and phalanges, and a trident configuration. The ribs are short with cupped anterior ends. If the radiographic features are not classic, a search for a different diagnosis should be entertained.



The diagnosis can be made on by fetal ultrasound by progressive discordance between the femur length and biparietal diameter by age. The trident hand configuration can be seen if the fingers are fully extended.

      <comment>/* Gender */  I corrected the pronunciation transcription for &quot;السيارة&quot; and  &quot;السيارات&quot;. (When the definite article, &quot;ال&quot;, precedes a sun letter, the lam is elided and the sun letter doubled. Thus, &quot;as-saiyaarah&quot;, not &quot;al-saihaarah&quot;.)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Compact Pronoun Charts==
How the following pronoun charts work:
The numbers before the semicolons indicate person.
1st person is used when you are talking about yourself, 2nd person to someone, and 3rd about someone/something.

The first word, after the number is in the Singular form.
A comma separating two words means the first one of those two words is masculine, the other is feminine.
A semicolon indicates a change in number. After the first comma is the dual and plural forms. If they are different there will be comma separating the dual and plural forms.

Plural forms are reserved for animate objects. Dual forms are not plural forms.
Plural inanimate objects are treated as feminine singular.

The feminine plural form is only used when all members of the group referred to are feminine. The same applies to the dual.

&lt;&lt;Person&gt;&gt;: &lt;&lt;singular&gt;&gt;  ; &lt;&lt;dual&gt;&gt;  ; &lt;&lt;plural&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Question Words:
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مَنْ&lt;/font&gt;
man = who
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;متى&lt;/font&gt;
mataà = when
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;أين&lt;/font&gt;
aina = where
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ماذا&lt;/font&gt;
maadħaa = what (before verb)
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ما&lt;/font&gt;
maa = what (before noun)
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;لِماذا&lt;/font&gt;
limaadħaa = why
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;كَيفَ&lt;/font&gt;
kaifa = how
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;لِمَن&lt;/font&gt;
li-man = whose
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;كَمْ&lt;/font&gt;
kam = how many/how much

&lt;br&gt;
Subject Pronouns:&lt;br&gt;
1: anâ ; nahžnu&lt;br&gt;
2: anta, anti ; antumaa ; antum, antunna&lt;br&gt;
3: huwa, hiya ; humaa,humaa ; hum,hunna&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ArSubjPronouns.gif|Subject Pronouns]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Possessive Adjectives are always suffixed to a noun:&lt;br&gt;
1: iî/-ya ; -naa&lt;br&gt;
2: -ka,-ki ; -kumaa ; -kum, -kunna&lt;br&gt;
3: -huú**, -haa ; -humaa,-humaa ; -hum,-hunna&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ArPossessiveAdj.gif|Possessive Adjective Suffixes]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Object Pronouns suffixed to verbs:&lt;br&gt;
1: -nii ; -naa&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ArObjectPronouns.gif|ArObjectPronouns.gif]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dative:   li + noun Or one of the following pronouns&lt;br&gt;
1: lii/liya ; lanaa&lt;br&gt;
2: laka, laki ; lakumaa ; lakum,lakunna&lt;br&gt;
3: lahuu, lahaa; lahumaa, lahumaa ; lahum, lahunna&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Possessive Pronouns: li + subject pronoun. Sometimes the word ''mulk'' meaning property is used.Sometimes the dative is used as a possessive noun.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Relative pronouns: (In English: which, who, that)&lt;br&gt;
X: Elladħii, Ellatii; ; Elladħiina,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This (default one, in English &quot;that&quot; is default)&lt;br&gt;
X: Haadħaa,Haadħihii; ;Haaŵulaa'i,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That&lt;br&gt;
X: Dħaalika,Tilka ;  ; Ulaaŷika&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The word &quot;inna&quot; usually starts sentences and joins with a pronoun in the following manner. When it doesn't begin a sentence it is best translated as &quot;that&quot;, it has also been translated as &quot;verily&quot;. There is no adequete way to translate it into English.
&lt;br&gt;
The following are sometimes used instead of placing subject pronouns after &quot;inna&quot;.
1: inna-nii (in-nii) ; inna-naa (in-naa)&lt;br&gt;
2: inna-ka,inna-ki ; inna-kumaa ; inna-kum,inna-kunna&lt;br&gt;
3: inna-huu,inna-haa ; inna-humaa,inna-humaa ; inna-hum, inna-hunna&lt;br&gt;
Using the word &quot;in&quot; to mean &quot;inna&quot; is archaic.&lt;br&gt;

The word &quot;anna&quot; works exactly the same way. Just change the &quot;i&quot; to an &quot;a&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
The word &quot;laakin&quot;, meaning usually ends like inna when the subject is being mentioned, in which case it becomes &quot;laákinna&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(huwa) qaala anna-nii... He said that I...&lt;br&gt;
Laákin-nii...             but I&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The following are really close in meaning but the first kind is rarely found.&lt;br&gt;
Inna anâ...     Inna-nii  &lt;br&gt;
Laakin anâ...     Laakinna-nii&lt;br&gt;
===Gender===
*f-female (The pronoun represents a woman, or a girl, or a grammatically feminine word)
*m-masculine (The pronoun represents a man, or a boy, or a grammatically masculine word)

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Note: Non-human objects, as with the case in Romance Languages, must be either masculine or feminine.  For example &quot;book&quot; (كتاب) is masculine, and so uses the subject pronoun &quot;هو&quot;.  &quot;Library,&quot; (مكتبة) however, is feminine, and so uses the subject pronoun &quot;هي&quot;.  However, ALL non-human plurals take the feminine singular.  (e.g. libraries = هي, books = هي) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
سيارة meaning &quot;car&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
سيارات meaning &quot;cars&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;السيارة --&gt; هي&lt;/font&gt;(as-saiyaarah-&gt;hiya)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;السيارات --&gt; هي&lt;/font&gt;(as-saiyaaraat-&gt;hiya)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
but
أم meaning &quot;mother&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
أمهات meaning &quot;mothers&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;الأم--&gt;هي&lt;/font&gt;(al-um--&gt;hiya)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;الأمهات--&gt;هن&lt;/font&gt;(al-ummuhaat--&gt;hunna)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Septic arthritis is a common destructive arthropathy that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to avoid the significant morbidity that results from the loss of a joint.  Therefore, it should be strongly considered in the differential diagnosis of monoarticular disease.  

==Diagnosis==
Traditionally, the diagnosis of septic arthritis was based on clinical assessment and prompt arthrocentesis.  However, the clinical picture may be obscured by multiple confounding factors and a paucity of specific findings especially for the deep joints, i.e. the hip or shoulder.  Imaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis of septic arthritis and more importantly, imaging findings suggestive of septic arthritis can direct the clinician to a diagnosis that may not have been considered. 

==Radiologic Findings==
Plain film findings of septic arthritis include: joint effusion, soft tissue swelling, periarticular osteoporosis, loss of joint space, marginal and central erosions and bone ankylosis.  CT is more sensitive than plain films for the detection of early bone destruction and effusion.

The role of MRI in the diagnosis of septic arthritis has been increasing in recent years in an effort to detect this entity earlier.  Findings are usually evident within 24 hours following the onset of infection and include: synovial enhancement, perisynovial edema and joint effusion.  Signal abnormalities in the bone marrow can indicate a concomittant osteomyelitis.  The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for the detection of septic arthritis has been reported to be 100% and 77% respectively.

===Is Coding Theory Boring?===

That depends on how you look at it.  Everything in the universe is an encoding of something else.  You can think of color, light, sound, music, teddy bears, your friends and many other things as encodings of energy.

===What is coding theory?===

The key idea is “most efficient”;  this comes up all the time in life.  For instance, &quot;What is the best way to get to work?&quot; or &quot;What is the cheapest lunch?&quot;  These are really asking what is the most efficient path from one point to another, in terms of some way of measuring things.

In this article, it should be remembered the term Information is used in an abstract way.  It can mean information in an ordinary sense; but it can also mean patterns, energy, sound, or a lot of other things.

So coding theory is the study of how to encode information (or behaviour or thought, etc.) in the most efficient way.  It also has to do with methods of deleting noise in the environment, so that the original message can be received clearly.  But this also should be done in the most efficient way.

===The flow of information in the universe===

Energy is constantly being transformed from one form to another. Heat to light, light to heat,
potential to kinetic and so on.  One can think of the entire universe as a computer and the matter as the data.  So then one has a continuous data transformer.  If this seems too restrictive and breeds questions about free will and so on, then one can simply look at the inanimate universe in this way.

===Coding theory in Music, Astronomy, Politics ===

=====Music=====

[[Heinrich Schenker]] is one of the most famous music theorists.  He isn't too well known to the general public because you almost have to be a graduate student in music to understand what he is saying.  It is hoped that others who have studied the theory wont frown wrathfully (like Beethoven) at the oversimplifications in this section.  But hopefully more people will understand it from this point of view.

His main ideas gradually took their present form over the course of his life.  His ideas were still under construction when he passed away, and it is somewhat debatable where they would have led him if he had lived to be very very old.  A reasonable guess is that he would have concluded that all music exists before it is even written.  As waves radiate outward when a stone is dropped into water, so music has a natural immutable form that cannot be changed; it arises from the initial disturbance of sound, just as the waves in the pond do.  So the music is simply playing itself out [[recursively]], and the job of the composer is to find the &quot;sweep of improvisation&quot; that plays out the initial disturbance.

His central concept is the &quot;chord of nature&quot;; he taught that all music arises from and falls back into this chord, just as a feedback version of [[fourier series]] and [[interference pattern]]s arises from and then recedes back into a Chinese gong when it is struck.  The chord itself is based on physics and is well known to scientists.  But here we see an example of coding theory.  That is, if the music is already there, and is simply moving back to equilibrium, then it is really looking for the most efficient path to that chord.  It should not waste any energy, so to speak, and this is what gives it its beauty and natural artistry, just as rain or snow has a natural artistry.  So the most profound music is an encoding of sound information that matches the [[Shannon entropy]].  (There is probability inherent in this in the sense that sound can be thought of as brownian motion, and the waves as global effects of the brownian motion).

Note that there is no error correcting in music though.  If you miss it, you miss it.  It would be interesting to see what Schenker would have said about communication in the presence of lots of other radios playing, horns honking, and noise in general.  Perhaps he would have come up with a theory of Music in the Presence of Noise, just as Shannon did for other types of information.

=====Astronomy=====

One author asked the question &quot;why does Copernicus seem more right than the theorists that went before him?&quot;  Both the [[epicycle]] model and the Copernican model of the solar system can be used to predict the location of the planets.  He concluded that the human race feels that Copernicus is more right because his ideas are simpler - the key is simplicity.  So one could say that he found a more efficient encoding of the information of the solar system, and that the human race is passionate about coding theory without even realizing it!

=====Politics=====

What makes the following political statements powerful (or at least famous)?

       Ich...bin...ein...Berliner! (cheers)
       Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country

One can argue that what gives these statements their force is efficiency of expression;  they are an [[interpolation]] of many feelings, attitudes and perceptions;  they are an efficient encoding of emotional and mental information.

===A modern example: cell phone technology ===

At the time of this writing cell phones are important.  But cellphone text messaging costs money.  So how do you minimize costs?  In some third world nations, people are actually developing elaborate languages for data transmission that help them save money.  For instance, one may encode the message &quot;talk to you at 7 o'clock&quot; as &quot;tk 2 u @ 7&quot; and so on.  This is effective in the situation that [[Claude E. Shannon]] described as Communication Without Noise.  That is, as long as the message is properly received, no harm is done.  But Shannon also stated that because of the presence of noise, some redundancy may be important.  He noted that the English language seems to be about 50% meaningless syntax, letters, phrasing and so on.  He felt that this occurred by the natural function of the mind, the purposeful addition of excessive information that allows for error correction - by the listener or reader.

Animals also encode information efficiently in various ways.  Chirps, squawks, growls, tweets, meows, woofs and even elephants' pounding on the ground in order to communicate with other elephants far away;  these are all examples of encodings of information that attempt to be as efficient as possible.

At this point an interesting question about cellphone technology becomes apparent: Is there one most optimal encoding method for cellphone communication?  In order to answer that effectively, one would have to average all messages sent (in a region for example), then translate the result into binary, then construct a [[stochastic process]] (essentially a computer that sends an average message in terms of probabilities of various patterns occurring) that is essentially equivalent to those messages.  At that point the entropy could be calculated and a matching code developed.  But the lingering problem is this:  given a communication pattern (a stochastic process), how can you generate an efficient encoding scheme?  In summary, one is looking for a [[black box]] that receives a stochastic process and produces a code.

                          average message  ---&gt;  black box ---&gt;  best encoding scheme

===A Powerful Solution: Neural Networks===

One can design a [[neural network]] that can essentially writes programs by itself.  It is possible to train a network on a large number of randomly chosen stochastic processes, while providing an increased reward for producing a more efficient code, and a decreased reward for producing a less efficient code.  In many situations, the entropy can almost certainly be approximated.

Neural networks are interpolations of data.  As they learn the pattern they can be more finely tuned and so on.  However this is not the fun kind of interpolation that may be taught in high school as [[Lagrange interpolation]]; although an interesting game, this method involves usually a single variable and a few data points.  On the other hand, neural networks can be quite intense, in the sense that the number of variables can be very large, and the number of data points can run into the millions.  Therefore, there is no way of using ordinary methods to interpolate that kind of data.

Proponents of [[differential geometry]] have proposed that neural networks should be studied carefully in order to produce a solid mathematical theory that can be used to predict their behaviour exactly in every situation.  But the task is very complex, and almost no hope of achieving the goal exists at the present time.  So the general study remains as more of an experimental science.  In practice however, networks have been used very effectively in many situations and are very intriguing.

===A River of Sound===

When a composer writes a song, he or she may be given the melody first, and then may want to put &quot;chords&quot; to it.  That is, he or she is harmonizing the melody.  Sometimes the person will put a nice chord to the melody at each point, but the chords will not match in the long run.  ''Locally'', the music sounds nice, but ''globally'' it sounds rather ghastly.  Yet when they alter one of the chords, to make it sound nice globally, it takes away from the quality at an unexpected chord somewhere else.  So you end up with a knot that is almost impossible to untangle.

The technical term is The Harmonization of Chorales.  This is a standard part of musical tranining in universities.  One can see how it may take a lot of practice and training to become good at it.  (In the previous paragraph, the concept of several melodies is oversimplified to the concept &quot;chord&quot; in order to make it easier to read).  Can computers be used to solve problems like this?

Yes, but not ordinary computers.  Neural networks have been used a lot during the past decade to harmonize chorales.  They have been very successful and people are putting a lot of time and energy into the study.

So you can see that global harmony is in interpolation of the sound information, in such a way as to maximize the total beauty of the music.  Its a matter of efficiency.  Gradually moving from one point to another with each step instantaneously optimized.  This is exactly how a river flows, maximizing efficiency at each step instantaneously.  (The reader may recall the use of the word Instantaneous from Calculus).

===Computer Programs as Encodings===

If you were going to tell a taxi driver where to go, would you take ten minutes to do so?
Why not just give him the address and go?  It you are going to tell a mechanic what is wrong with your car, why spend days explaining it?  Why not explain it in a single sentence?

In the same way, a program that tells a computer what to do can very wordy or very precise.  This may make the difference between solving a large-scale programming project and not solving it, and it can make or break a multimillion dollar contract renewal.  The process is essentially summed up as [[numerical analysis]].

The task is to find the ultimate possible most efficient (in terms of time and/or storage) program, and people have dedicated their entire careers to such studies.  There are many professional journals that deal with nothing else.  But it suggests that there is pre-existing best program in nature, apart from the programmers efforts.  That is, there is an entropy associated with programs, just as there is a predictable pattern of the behaviour of comets or of other entities that occur in nature.

Therefore we having difficulty in separating the concept of 'problem to be solved' from 'solution of problem'.  Again, they seem to occur as dual objects in nature, just as the behaviours of [[Pluto]] and [[Charon]] are fully dependent on each other.  So a different concept of complexity was developed, and this is known as [[Kolmogorov]]'s complexity.  It says that the information (or light or sound) is the same as the most efficient possible program (or sentence) that generates it.  But we have to find the most efficient program;  so again neural networks can be used as a means of trying to solve the problem.  It is interesting that a technology modeled on the human brain (a computer that exists in nature) should be used to find a solution to problems that occur in nature.

An interesting generalization of the Kolmogorov complexity is the Kolmogorov complexity for an infinite (or perhaps finite) number of parallel processors.  That is, what is the most efficient sentence that generates a pattern with several processors all working at the same time?  One can see how the answer will depend on the total number of processors allowed.

===Geodesics and Galaxies===

What is a [[geodesic]]?  It's just the shortest distance from point A to point B.  But isn't that just a straight line?  If you are working on a flat plane, then it is.  But a flat plane is just the [[limit]] of an infinite sequence of surfaces.  So then what is the shortest distance on those surfaces?  That's exactly the problem, and it can be a very interesting one.

Now of course one can see how this has to do with life.  In every day situations, with many variables and fluctuations of data going on all the time,  the most efficient path from one situation to another situation can be thought of as a geodesic.  And the set of all possible situations can be thought of as a surface.  Therefore the best plan of action would be the most efficient encoding of information.  The poorer the encoding, the less effective the action.  The better the encoding, the more effective the action.  Remember that the more realistic the variables are, the more valuable the encoding will be.

For instance, if a young man wants to meet a certain woman, he doesn't want to spend 30 lifetimes accomplishing it.  Therefore his plan of action can be thought of as a geodesic on the surface of all life situations, and the better he encodes that information, the more valuable his actions will be.

Another example would be a mouse learning to solve a maze.  He has to repeatedly re-encode the information in his mind so that he can improve his actions.  Therefore he is computing a geodesic of the information [[manifold]] of the maze.

Everything in the inanimate universe follows geodesics.  This is how the galaxies rotate and what gives them their power and beauty.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is now 11:55 on Wednesday, 10.12.05, the deadline for this assignment. While this section is, for the most part, complete, there are a few holes in the dike.

*references need to be included in the reference page
*internal citations need to be edited to conform with APA conventions
*proofing for typos, grammar, bizarre syntax, and spelling errors
*I fear that I have omitted an important feature of bl: encouraging active learning.

Most depressingly, I'm not sure that I've achieve what I set out to do. Partly this is because there isn't a consensus of what the essential design principles for bl are. Still, I feel that all I have done is assembled a pastiche' from a few articles. I'm not sure that after reading this section a person would know what the guiding principles of bl design are.

I will fix the top stuff tomorrow, even though it is past the deadline, for the sake of acknowledging the work I used if for no other reason. As to the last two, without a major re-write I think I'm stuck with what I put together.

At least I discovered how to create tables in wiki markup.

Final thoughts:
Overall, our product is better than I thought last night. Enthusiastic pruning would help a great deal. The introductory section, Blended Learnig by Design, in particular need some serious thinning. It should be about a quarter of its current state IMHO. I think we also repeat some elements between the sections. This is true across the other chapters I have glanced at. If I was Norma, I'd want to scream if I had to look at another listing of blended learning components (mine included).
All in all, a pretty good effort.

One more thing, is it just me or do citations become almost impossibly fussy? I think I understand the need to document sources with standard conventions but geez, I get tired of pondering whether or not I need a period after this phrase or if proceeding should be cited differently than an electronic article, etc. Done venting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Protestant Reformation ==

The occasion of the outbreak of the Reformation was the sale of indulgences in Germany. It had always been a tenet of the Catholic Church that indulgences remit penalties due to sin after severe repentance and aid of the sacrament of penance. Leo X, in 15l3, being desirous to complete the great temple of Saint Peter's, which Julius II had commenced, granted an indulgence to those who would contribute financial aid for that purpose. A certain Johann Tetzel, to whom the archbishop of Magdeburg had delegated the power of dispensing indulgences in Saxony, was a well-known figure of the realm. He had been inquisitor general of Poland and was also associated with the Dominican monastery at Leipzig, but he carried out his commission in such a way that wrong ideas about the effect of indulgences began to spread among the ignorant and credulous, and many intelligent Christians opposed his methods. Martin Luther, an Augustinian monk and teacher of theology at the University of Wittenberg, was foremost among those who denounced Tetzel, and as this preacher of indulgences appeared at Juterbog in the vicinity of Wittenberg just at the time of the celebration of a yearly festival, when it was customary to post on the church doors bulletins of general interest to the parish, Luther accordingly nailed to the door ninety-five theses, on October 31, 1517, warning the people against such persons as Tetzel and emphasizing the necessity of a penitent heart and a loving spirit in making gifts to the Church. Copies of these theses were widely dessiminated, and all the continent was soon plunged into a tumult of controversy. Luther, meanwhile, devoted himself to further study of the Bible, Church history and canon law, in order to defend the position he had taken, and he drifted further and further from the Church. His public utterances and writings became bolder, and he was soon attacking the entire system and body of teachings of the Church of Rome. He maintained that contrition, confession and absolution were not necessary to secure salvation, denied the infallibility of the councils of the Church and asserted that the Bible was the only foundation of faith and that bishops, priests and formal ritual were wholly unnecessary. Owing to his wide reputation for learning and piety, his opinions on  these subjects influenced a great many people.

At first the pope, Adrian VI, did not regard the matter as of serious import; but at length, being convinced that Luther's influence was becoming dangerous, he urged the Diet of Nuremberg to institute determined action against him. The Diet, however, felt powerless to carry out the desire of the pope, because of the popularity of Luther with a number of the German princes. Frederick the Elector became his great patron. His writings were, however, condemned as heretical, and he himself, if he did not recant his errors in sixty days, was to be seized and sent to Rome to be tried for heresy. Luther publicly burned this communication. In 1521 Luther was summoned by emperor Charles V to appear before the Diet of Worms and was called upon to recant his errors. Refusing to do so, he was conveyed privately to the Wartburg Castle by Frederick, elector of Saxony, where he lived in seclusion for a time and busied himself with the translation of the New Testament into German. In 1524 William Tyndale driven from England for his reformation views sought haven in Germany while translating the New Testament into English. On May 4, 1526, an alliance of the reform-minded princes was formed at Torgau, under the leadership of John (Frederick), the elector of Saxony, and Philip, the landgrave of Hesse. The Catholics formed a counter-alliance at Dessau, which emphasized a disunion that was destined to exercise an influence in every part of the world. The followers of Luther having become so numerous, Philip of Hesse convened a synod at Homburg in October, 1526, to systematize the doctrines and establish a rule of faith. A constitution was there formed which gave an individual congregation power to decide its own ecclesiastical rules. This was adopted in the several Lutheran states, in each of which the chief, or head, of the government was to be supreme in relation to the Church. In addition to John (Frederick) of Saxony and Philip of Hesse the dissenting electors included George of Brandenburg, princes Ernest and Francis of Brunswick-Luneburg, and Wolfgang, prince of Anhalt, together with fourteen imperial cities, the chief of which were Strassburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, and Constance.

Martin Luther had a keen interest in the education of the youth. Included in his ideas about local school systems was the establishment of elementary schools for the instruction of girls. To educate the younger element of the people, Luther wrote a small catechism of a doctrinal character in 1529, which was extensively circulated. The invention of the printing press spread the written works of Luther broadly over Europe and contributed to the rapidity of change. Because of the Islamic threat from Turkish incursions in southern Europe and a desire to allay, if possible, the dissensions which had arisen in relation to questions of an ecclesiastical nature, a diet was held on April 19, 1529, at Spires. The Catholics submitted what they regarded as moderate claims. The state sponsors of Luther’s revolt held out against papal supremacy. A decree was issued from Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire that the religious tolerance instituted in 1526 would be reversed. This led to vigorous protest by the followers of Luther, which was the origin of the name Protestant, referring to states or territories in the religio-political sense. That name has since been applied to Lutherans and other Christian denominations who differ with the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church.

== Ingredients: ==

* Onions
* Garlic
* Sugar
* Tomatoes, chopped

== Procedure: ==

#Fry onions in olive oil to transparent.  Ensure that the onions don't burn.
#Add lots of chopped garlic.  Again, ensure they don't burn.
#Add a large amount of sugar. Don't caramelise.
#Chop tomatoes and remove any hard parts.
#Add tomatoes to onions and garlic, excess olive oil. 
#Simmer for approximately 4 hours. Lose as much water as possible. (This order isn't logical as the oil prevents evaporation. It would be interesting to simmer and then add the oil at the end, but I've never tried that. )
#Add Salt, pepper, herbes de Provence. Also add Vinegar if you feel like it, but not much.
#Should keep even without refrigeration if you've lost enough water. Traditionally you keep it in unsealed jars and just scoop and throw away any mould on the surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The Lisfranc joint, named after a field surgeon in Napoleon's army who described a new technique of forefoot amputation for soldiers with gangrene related to frostbite, defines the boundary between the midfoot and forefoot. The joint can be disrupted traumatically by axial loading, with rotational forces directed either medially or laterally. This classically occurs when patients get their foot caught in something, such as stirrups when horse riding. Disruption of the lisfranc joint is also seen in the Charcot joint in diabetics.

==Clinical Presentation==
The presention of patients with a traumatic lisfranc injury is variable depending on its severity. While some patients will present with obvious physical foot deformities, others may present with only midfoot pain with weight bearing. The typical clinical signs include midfoot plantar echhymosis, midfoot instability, and pain along the TMT joints with motion.

==Anatomy==
The 5 TMT joints form the Lisfranc joint. Important ligaments transverse these joints, critical for support and strength. Ligaments connect the bases of each of the metatarsals to each other, except the first two. There is also an oblique ligament between the medial cuneiform and the base of the 2nd metatarsal. 

==Radiologic Findings==
The initial radiological work-up consists of an AP, lateral, and medial oblique views. If these views fail to demonstrate a lisfranc injury and there is high clinical suspicion, getting full weight bearing views or stress views if the patient is unable to weight bear is essential. A CT scan can also be obtained, which may show an occult injury. 

The following should be considered when evaluating radiographs for a Lisfranc fracture-dislocation:
#Perhaps the most important alignment is along the second metatarsal and second cuneiform. A step-off between these two bones is indicative of a Lisfranc disruption. 
#Malalignment of the fourth metatarsal and cuboid can also be diagnostic of a Lisfranc injury. 
#The medial cuneiform-second metatarsal space should be evaluated for the &quot;fleck sign&quot; indicating avulsion of the Lisfranc ligament. 


&lt;center&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3&lt;/b&gt; Lisfranc fracture demonstrating medial dislocation of the 1st metatarsal.
&lt;/center&gt;

==Treatment==
Anatomically stable injuries can be treated conservatively, whereas unstable injuries or malalignment requires surgery. Generally, surgery involves open reduction and fixation with screws across the affected TMT joint(s). Screws are typically left in for 6 months.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
This chapter describes an implementation of what has been discussed so far.  

The technique used is to intersperse code and discussion.  You should be able to extract the code by simply copying the whole page and commenting out the discussion.

The previous discussion has been at a very high level, implementing it will require both high level and low level coding and also a lot of refinement of our ideas.

The application will consist of a form, some modules and some classes.  We'll begin at the top by creating the user interface of the application, then we will add the code that makes it work piece by piece.  We will find that some of what was said in the previous discussion was incomplete, some of it misleading.  That's what happens in real development.

=User Interface=

I have chosen to implement this program as a ''Multiple Document Interface'' application.  this is usually referred to as a ''MDI'' application.  All this means is that it will be possible to have more than one Jarithmetic document open at the same time in the same instance of the program.  This is the way that most Microsoft Office applications worked in the past.


==fMainform.frm==

Here is a possible main form.  The picture shows more menus than are actually implemented in the first version, implement them as you go along.

[[Image:Visual_Basic_Classic_Jarithmetic_mdi_form.png|MDI form]]

Here is the declaration of the controls on the form.  You can paste this into a text editor and save it as ''fMainForm.frm'' to get started quickly.

The main form is a container for as many documents as the user wants to open.  Each document will be an ''instance'' of ''frmDocument'', see the next section.

Now here is the visible code of the form.  It is quite short as the MDI form doesn't do very much, it mostly just acts as a container for document forms.

The MDI form has a file menu.  When there are no document forms open it is this menu that is active.  When document forms are open the file menu that is shown belongs to the document form but we will still call this method.  When VB creates the mthod for us it will be marked ''Private'', we can change this to ''Public'' as has been done here but it might be cleaner and less confusing to leave it ''Private'' and add a new ''Friend'' method that calls it.
  
When we open a document we must first create a document form to hold it.  Within this program instance of frmDocument represent the document.  The design decision made here is that each time we open a document it will be loaded into a new instance of frmDocument.  This might or might not be appropriate, consider what happens if the user opens the same document twice and edits both.
  
We use the Common Dialog control provided by Microsoft but we could also use a form containing Drive, Folder and File list controls.
    
  Option Explicit ' always use this to ensure that you don't forget to declare variables
  
  
  Public Sub mnuFileOpen_Click()
      
    Dim oForm As frmDocument
    Set oForm = LoadNewDoc
    
    With CommonDialog1
      ' The title should probably say something meaningful about the application and the document 
      .DialogTitle = &quot;Open&quot; type
      .CancelError = False
      .Filter = gsFILE_FILTER
      .ShowOpen
      If Len(.FileName) = 0 Then
        Exit Sub
      End If
      If Not oForm.LoadFile(.FileName) Then
        MsgBox &quot;Could not load file &lt;&quot; &amp; .FileName &amp; &quot;&gt;,&quot; &amp; vbCrLf &amp; &quot;probably couldn't find the zlib.dll.&quot;, _
               vbOKOnly + vbCritical, Title
      End If
    End With
  
  End Sub
  

The ''LoadNewDoc'' function is separated from the ''File Open'' event handler so that it can be used by other callers.

  Public Function LoadNewDoc() As frmDocument
    
    Static lDocumentCount As Long
    lDocumentCount = lDocumentCount + 1
    Set LoadNewDoc = New frmDocument
    LoadNewDoc.Caption = &quot;Document &quot; &amp; lDocumentCount
    LoadNewDoc.Show
  
  End Function
  

When we unload the main form we want to be able to make sure that all the documents are properly cleaned up so we call a function to exit from the application.  We could use the return value to set the ''Cancel'' argument, then the user might be able to stop the shutdown.

  Private Sub MDIForm_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
    ExitApplication
  End Sub

==frmDocument.frm==

The document form holds one of our arithmetic documents.  It is not much more complicated than the main form.  However it does define some different menus.  Also because of the way VB6 works it must define all the same menus too, it can't inherit them from the main form.  VB shows the menus defined by the current form unless there is only the MDI form in which case that one is shown.  Again the graphic shows more menus than are actually implemented in this prototype.

Here is the code.  Some of the routines have very little to do with our principal goals of creating a live mathematical document.  This is often the case; as you develop a program you discover small unforeseen problems that need to be solved as you go along in order make the program work properly or simply be comfortable to use.

In VB the ''Tab'' key is used to move the focus from on control to the next but when editing text we usually want to actually insert a ''Tab'' character.  One way to make this happen is to declare an ''Event Handler'' for the ''KeyDown'' event of the ''Rich Text Box''.  This checks to see what the ''ASCII'' code of the key is and directly overwrites the selected characters in the ''Rich Text Box'' to a ''Tab'' character:

  Private Sub rtfbox_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
    If KeyCode = 9 Then
      rtfBox.SelText = vbTab
      KeyCode = 0
    End If    
  End Sub

Loading a file is easy.  Just call the ''LoadFile'' method of the ''Rich Text Box''.  The only complication to take care of is that the user could try tpo pen a document that the ''Rich Text Box'' can't handle.  Here we decide that this is not really an error in the program so we don't raise an error; instead we return a status value: ''True'' if we succeeded, ''false'' if not.

  Public Function LoadFile(rsFile As String) As Boolean
    On Error Resume Next
    rtfBox.LoadFile rsFile
    LoadFile = Err.Number = 0    
  End Function

Here is the method that actually does the work.  Note that all the complicated stuff is in another module.  This is because we can easily amigine cases where we would want to automate these things in which case it might be that we get the text from somewhere else

  Public Sub EvalDoc()
    goEvalDoc.EvalDoc rtfBox
  End Sub

Of course there is no point in having a method to recalculate the document if there is no way of running it so we call it from the ''Data Evaluate'' menu item.  Take a look at the declarations above and see that a short cut key is attached to that menu item (''F9''):

  Public Sub mnuEvaluate_Click()
    EvalDoc
  End Sub

Remember that the main form's menu is not available when this form is active so we call the ''File Open'' event handler of the main form from our own ''file Open'' event handler.  this is why we had to change from ''Private'' to ''Public'' (''Friend'' would have worked too):

  Public Sub mnuFileOpen_Click()
    fMainform.mnuFileOpen_Click
  End Sub

To create a brand new document we must call the ''LoadNewDoc'' method of the main form:

  Public Sub mnuFileNew_Click()
    fMainform.LoadNewDoc
  End Sub

==cEvalDoc.cls==
This class is where a lot of the hard work is done.  The main method, ''EvalDoc'' looks very simple because it simply calls three other functions.  These functions:

*pre-process the document so that it is legal JScript,
*execute the JScript,
*update the document with the results.

The pre-processing step converts macros into JScript functions that store the location of the text to be replaced in a table and also converts matrices into JScript function calls that return arrays.  This makes it practical to assign arrays of values to a variable and deal with the array as a whole instead of each element one at a time.

Here is the header of the class.  In the Visual Basic IDE you can't see this text but you can change the values because they are shown in the properties window.

The actual evaluation of the JScript source code is done by the ''MSScript'' control.  Not sure what the ''Attibute'' is for.

  Public moScriptControl As MSScriptControl.ScriptControl
  Attribute moScriptControl.VB_VarHelpID = -1

The Jscript interpreter only provides the basic functions of JavaScript, any unusual funtions must be provided by us.  We do this by creating an object that provides those functions as methods.

  Private moFunctions As cFunctions

The document evaluator object must be initialized before use.  This means creating an instance of the script control, telling the script control which language will be used and providing a global object that adds extra functions to the interpreter.

  Private Sub Class_Initialize()
    Set moScriptControl = New MSScriptControl.ScriptControl
    With moScriptControl
      .AllowUI = False
      .Language = &quot;JScript&quot;
      .UseSafeSubset = True
    End With
    Set moFunctions = New cFunctions
    moScriptControl.AddObject &quot;Functions&quot;, moFunctions, True
    Set moFunctions.oScriptControl = moScriptControl
  End Sub

The only public method of this class is ''EvalDoc'' which takes a Rich Text box as its only argument, processes the text it finds in it and puts the answers back in the document.

  Public Sub EvalDoc(ByRef roDoc As RichTextBox)
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    
We begin by replacing all the macros we find in the text by JScript function calls that will create the results in the results arrray.

    Dim sScript As String
    sScript = xPreprocess(roDoc.Text)

The results array is a dynamic array that we allow to grow as needed but we don't shrink it because we know that we will evaluate the document again so deallocating the memory would be a waste of time.  So we reinitialize the array by simply setting the count of results to zero.  The counter is also the pointer to the next free slot in the array.

    glResultsCount = 0

Now everything is ready all we have to do is execute the script using the built in ''Eval'' function.

    moScriptControl.Run &quot;eval&quot;, sScript

Lastly, if everything went well, we have to put the answers back into the document.

    xUpdateDisplay roDoc
  
    Exit Sub

Unfortunately things can go wrong so we must take steps to prevent the program crashing.  Problems can occur if the user mis-types a macro by missing out the closing bracket.  There can be ordinary syntax errors in the JScript that the user writes and, of course, the program itself can have bugs.  So we must have an error handler.

  ErrorHandler:
    Select Case Err.Number

If the user mis-typed the macro by omitting the closing bracket this will be noticed by the preprocessor.  In this prototype we handle the problem by selecting the offending text and showing a message box to alert the user.

      Case ChunkNotTerminated
        roDoc.SelStart = xErrData(Err.Description)(0)
        roDoc.SelLength = xErrData(Err.Description)(1)
        MsgBox &quot;Missing #&gt; at end of macro&quot;

If the problem is that the macro is correctly formed but unrecognized we do the same as for a syntactically faulty macro.

      Case UnrecognizedMacro
        roDoc.SelStart = xErrData(Err.Description)(0)
        roDoc.SelLength = xErrData(Err.Description)(1)
        MsgBox &quot;Unrecognized macro, did you mean to display a value?&quot;

Because we cannot predict what errors will occur we end with a catch all clause that notifies the user.  Note the ''.ErrorContextxxx'' properties; these are set by the JScript functions that were written by the preprocessor so that the user can be directed at the part of the document that was being processed when the error was discovered.

      Case Else
        With moFunctions
          .MakeResult Empty, .ErrorContextStart_, _
                      .ErrorContextEnd_ - .ErrorContextStart_, _
                      SourceError
        End With        
    End Select
  
  End Sub

Because Visual basic does not have exceptions we need some way of passing information from the routine that raises an error to the routine that catches it.  One simple way is to package the information into a string and use the description property of the ''Err'' object.  Then when the error is trapped we can fetch the data out of the description using the ''Split'' function.  This little function simply wraps the Split function, partly this is simply to give it a meaningful name but also because it seemed at the beginning that the processing would be more complicated.

  Private Function xErrData(ByRef rsErrDescription As String) As Variant
    xErrData = Split(rsErrDescription, &quot;|&quot;)
  End Function

Before the text of the document can be evaluated by the Script control we must ensure that the text is legal JScript.
We do this by taking a copy of the text in a string, looking for directives and macros and generating appropriate code for them.

Output is handled by calling functions that add variable values to the output list.  These functions need three arguments: the value to be output, the starting point in the text and the length of the text range that is to be replaced.  The user cannot be expected to count lines and maintain these values so a macro is used instead.  The output is placed in the text at the point where the macro appears.  Unlike most macro replacement systems we won't replace the whole macro with the output because then we would lose the placeholder and would not be able to update it.  The macro comprises three parts: intro, body, outro.  The intro and outro stay put in the text but the body is replaced by the new output.  It is important to choose character sequence that cannot occur as a legal sequence in a JavaScript program and is also unlikely to appear in text string.

The sequence I have chosen is &lt;# #&gt;.

Macros can appear in comments and will work there too.

For now ''Split' and ''Instr'' are used to find the markers, regular expressions might be better but I don't know for sure.  This function is rather complicated in practice but the basic idea is quite straightforward:
*split the text into ''chunks'' using the ''intro'' as a delimiter,
*note the character offset of each ''intro'' string by accumulating the lengths of the ''chunks''
*remove all text that is in comments,
*replace the macros with function calls to a function that stores the value of the named variable along with the start and length of the position where it is to be inserted,

All this happens on a copy of the text, the rich text box is not disturbed at this point.

  Private Function xPreprocess(rsText As String) As String
    
    Const sINTRO As String = &quot;&lt;#&quot;
    Const sOUTRO As String = &quot;#&gt;&quot;
    Dim aChunks As Variant

Split the text using the ''intro'' sequence.  This results in a list (Variant array) of chunks of text that all start with a macro (except for the first item in the list if there was any text before the first macro).

    aChunks = Split((rsText), sINTRO)
    Dim lChunk As Long

The actual text that is executed doesn't need any comments so we create a new text from the chunks by removing the both single line and multiple line comments from the first chunk.  This chunk must be dealt with specially because it is the exception to the rule that all chunks begin with a macro.

    xPreprocess = xRemoveComments((aChunks(LBound(aChunks))))
    Dim lStart As Long

In order for the results to be placed in the text at the correct positions we must keep track of the character offset from the start of the text to the macro.  Note that we must always add the length of the ''intro'' explicitly because it does not appear in the list of chunks.

    lStart = Len(aChunks(LBound(aChunks))) + Len(sINTRO)
    Dim lEnd As Long
    Dim lLenChunk As Long
    Dim lEndVar As Long

Now we can process each chunk and add the processed text to the string to be executed.

    For lChunk = LBound(aChunks) + 1 To UBound(aChunks)

First we must check to see if the macro was terminated searching the chunk for the ''outro''.  If the ''outro'' is missing we raise an error because the user must have made a mistake and forgotten to complete the macro.  It might be argued that we should attempt to patch up the text and continue.  See ''Exercises''.

      lEnd = InStr(aChunks(lChunk), sOUTRO)
      If lEnd Then
        Dim sChunk As String
        sChunk = Left$(aChunks(lChunk), lEnd)

Now we have a complate macro we must check to see if we recognize it.  At the moment there is only one type of macro, that is the ''show value'' macro.
        lEndVar = InStr(sChunk, &quot;=&quot;)
        If lEndVar Then
          xPreprocess = xPreprocess &amp; &quot;;&quot; &amp; vbCrLf _
                      &amp; &quot;show(&quot; &amp; Left$(aChunks(lChunk), lEndVar - 1) _
                      &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; (lStart + lEndVar) &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; (lEnd - lEndVar - 1) _
                      &amp; &quot;)&quot; &amp; vbCrLf _
                      &amp; xRemoveComments(Mid$(aChunks(lChunk), _
                                             lEnd + Len(sOUTRO)))
          lStart = lStart + Len(aChunks(lChunk)) + Len(sINTRO)
        Else

If the ''='' sign is missing then this isn't a ''show value'' macro.  As we haven't defined any others this must be an error so we abort the process and report it.

          Err.Raise UnrecognizedMacro, &quot;xPreprocess&quot;, _
             lStart &amp; &quot;|&quot; &amp; Len(aChunks(lChunk)) &amp; &quot;|&quot; &amp; &quot;Unrecognized macro type&quot;
        End If
      Else

If the closing chunk characters are not found we raise an error and abort the process.

        Err.Raise ChunkNotTerminated, &quot;xPreprocess&quot;, _
           lStart &amp; &quot;|&quot; &amp; Len(aChunks(lChunk)) &amp; &quot;|&quot; &amp; &quot;Unterminated chunk&quot;
      End If
    Next lChunk
    
  End Function
  
It is simpler to convert the macros to code if we remove the surrounding comments.  We can do this on a chunk by chunk basis by defining a function that accepts a chunk and returns the same chunk minus any comments.  

  Private Function xRemoveComments(ByRef rsChunk As String) As String

Deal with the simplest cases first: single line comments and complete multiline comments. 

    xRemoveComments = xRemoveBracketed(rsChunk, &quot;//&quot;, vbLf)
    xRemoveComments = xRemoveBracketed(xRemoveComments, &quot;/*&quot;, &quot;*/&quot;)
  
Now remove any leading or traing multiline comment fragments.  These oocur because the chunk split ignores comment boundaries.  We search the chunk for the closing and opening multiline comment markers.

    Dim lComment As Long
    lComment = InStr(xRemoveComments, &quot;*/&quot;)
    If lComment Then
      xRemoveComments = Mid$(xRemoveComments, lComment + Len(&quot;*/&quot;))
    End If
    
    lComment = InStr(xRemoveComments, &quot;/*&quot;)
    If lComment Then
      xRemoveComments = Left$(xRemoveComments, lComment - 1)
    End If
    
  End Function

This function repeatedly removes substrings that fall between given starting and finishing markers until the starting marker no longer appears in the string.  

  Private Function xRemoveBracketed(ByRef rsChunk As String, _
                                    ByRef rsStart As String, _
                                    ByRef rsfinish As String) As String
    
    xRemoveBracketed = rsChunk
    Dim lStart As Long
    Do
      lStart = InStr(xRemoveBracketed, rsStart) ' single line
      If lStart Then
        Dim lFinish As Long
        lFinish = InStr(lStart, xRemoveBracketed, rsfinish)

If the finish marker does not appear then treat the string as though such a marker appeared at the character following the end of the string.  This allows us to delete single line comments that do not end in a newline sequence and multiline comments that are split by macros.

        If lFinish = 0 Then
          lFinish = Len(xRemoveBracketed) + 1
        End If
        xRemoveBracketed = Left$(xRemoveBracketed, lStart - 1) _
                         &amp; Mid$(xRemoveBracketed, lFinish)
      End If
    Loop Until lStart = 0
    
  End Function


Once the document has been evaluated we must put the answers back in the document at the correct places.  This seems at first to be a simple job because we have a list of values together with their locations in the document so at first sight it seems that we need to do is enumerate the results and replace the specified character ranges with the answers.  Unfortunately this won't work unless the new text is exactly the same length as the original because inserting new text that is of a different length will move the text that is to be replaced so the results records will point at the wrong place.  The solution is to enumerate the results in reverse order so that successive results to are inserted nearer the beginning of the document which means that only text that has already been updated will move.

  Private Sub xUpdateDisplay(roDoc As RichTextBox)
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    
    With roDoc

An additional complication is that we would like to preserve the user's selection.  We cannot simply store the values ''.SelStart'' and ''.SelLength'' and later copy them back because replacement may have occurred before or inside the selection, it might even happen that the selection boundaries fall inside a macro.  So each time we do a replacement we must update the selection.  So the first thing we must do is copy the values of those properties.

      Dim lSelStart As Long
      Dim lSelLen As Long
      Dim lSelNext As Long
      lSelStart = .SelStart
      lSelLen = .SelLength
      lSelNext = lSelStart + lSelLen

We start at the last result record and count back.  The results array is zero based so the results counter always points at the next avaialble slot.  Therefore we decrement the counter at the start of the loop, when we finish the counter will be zero.

      Do While 0 &lt; glResultsCount
        glResultsCount = glResultsCount - 1

To replace the text in the rich text box we must first set the ''.SelStart'' and ''.SelLength'' properties and in order to preserve the user's selection we must compare these values to the current values of the user's selection and update the user's selection if necessary. 

        .SelStart = gaResults(glResultsCount).Start
        .SelLength = gaResults(glResultsCount).length
        If .SelStart + .SelLength &lt; lSelStart Then
          lSelStart = lSelStart - .SelLength
          lSelNext = lSelStart + lSelLen
        End If

Exactly what the replacement text is depends on the result type and on whether or not an error occurred when trying to calculate it.  If an error occured then we colour the offending text red and leave it unchanged.  

        Select Case gaResults(glResultsCount).ResultType
          Case SourceError
            .SelColor = vbRed
          Case Else

If we succeeded then we colour the selection black and replace replaceable part of the macro with the result.  Now we see the reason for declaring the result as ''Variant'' because at last we see that it is possible to have charts in this document.  How the replacement is actually done depends on the type of the result.  If the result is a [[../Glossary#scalar|scalar]] then it is easy to use Visual Basic's string conversion functions to create a human readable representation but a plot is quite a different animal.  Because they are so fifferent we create separate functions for them.

            .SelColor = vbBlack
            If TypeOf gaResults(glResultsCount).Value Is cPlot Then
              xReplacePlot gaResults(glResultsCount).Value, roDoc
              If .SelStart &lt; lSelStart Then
                lSelStart = lSelStart + 1
                lSelNext = lSelStart + lSelLen
              End If
            Else
              .SelText = xToString(gaResults(glResultsCount).Value)
              If .SelStart &lt; lSelStart Then
                lSelStart = lSelStart _
                          + Len(xToString(gaResults(glResultsCount).Value))
                lSelNext = lSelStart + lSelLen
              End If
            End If
        End Select
      Loop

Now we can set the ''.SelStart'' and ''.SelLength'' properties again to restore the user's selection.  Of course if it included a macro that was replaced then the length of the selection may be quite different from what it was to start with.

      .SelStart = lSelStart
      .SelLength = lSelLen
    End With
    
    Exit Sub

The error handler in this function is incomplete, an exercise for the student perhaps.  At the moment is simply asserts a falsehood to stop the program and allow the developer to debug it.  In real life this would be quite complicated because we would like to process the whole document.  

  ErrorHandler:
    Debug.Assert False
    Resume
  End Sub

Because this is really a ''proof of concenpt'' rather than a finished aplication we can use a very simply method of converting results to text: just use implicit conversion.  The exception to this is ''matrices''.  Matrices are JScript arrays so we must do some extra work to format them.
  
  Private Function xToString(rvResult As Variant) As String
    
    If TypeName(rvResult) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot; Then
      ' assume that the object is a JavaScript array
      xToString = xJArrayToString(rvResult)
    Else
      Select Case VarType(rvResult)
        Case vbDouble, vbLong, vbInteger
          xToString = &quot; &quot; &amp; rvResult
        Case vbString
          xToString = &quot; '&quot; &amp; rvResult &amp; &quot;'&quot;
        Case Else
          xToString = rvResult
      End Select
    End If
  End Function

If the result is a plot then the result is really the name of a picture file.  To put it in the text we must use the clipboard to insert it, at least that is the simplest way.  If the file doesn't exist then we insert text to say so rather than leave the user wndering where the plot is.  Note that when this routine is called the selection has already been set to the replaceable part of the macro.

  Private Sub xReplacePlot(ByRef rvPlot As Variant, roDoc As RichTextBox)
    
    With roDoc
      If goFSO.FileExists(rvPlot.PicFileName) Then
        .SelText = &quot;&quot;     ' delete the old plot or whatever else there was.
        InsertPicture rvPlot.PicFileName, roDoc
      Else
        .SelText = &quot;File &lt;&quot; &amp; rvPlot.PicFileName &amp; &quot;&gt; does not exist.&quot;
      End If
      
    End With
    
  End Sub

If the result is an array then we format it in rows and columns using tab characters to separate the columns.  It is up to the user to set the tabs for that part of the text.  Unfortunately we haven't given the user the ability to do this yet, another exercise for the student.  
  
  Private Function xJArrayToString(rvResult As Variant) As String
    
    Debug.Assert TypeName(rvResult) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot;
    Dim oRow As Variant
    
    Dim lRow As Long
    Dim vItem As Variant
    xJArrayToString = vbTab &amp; &quot;[&quot;
    For lRow = 0 To rvResult.length - 1
      If lRow &lt;&gt; 0 Then
        xJArrayToString = xJArrayToString &amp; vbTab
      End If
      Set oRow = CallByName(rvResult, lRow, VbGet)
      If TypeName(oRow) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot; Then
        xJArrayToString = xJArrayToString &amp; vbTab &amp; xJRowToString(oRow)
      Else
        vItem = CallByName(rvResult, lRow, VbGet)
        xJArrayToString = xJArrayToString &amp; vbTab &amp; &quot;[&quot; &amp; vbTab &amp; vItem &amp; &quot;]&quot;
      End If
      If lRow &lt; rvResult.length - 1 Then
        xJArrayToString = xJArrayToString &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; vbCrLf
      End If
    Next lRow
    xJArrayToString = xJArrayToString &amp; &quot;]&quot;
    
  End Function

Each row is in fact a JScript array.  JScript doesn't have multidimensional arrays but because everything in JScript is an object we can easily simulate multi-dimensional arrays by having arrays of arrays.

  Private Function xJRowToString(rvResult As Variant) As String
    
    Debug.Assert TypeName(rvResult) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot;
    Dim oRow As Variant
    
    Dim lCol As Long
    Dim vItem As Variant
    xJRowToString = &quot;[&quot;
    For lCol = 0 To rvResult.length - 1
      vItem = CallByName(rvResult, lCol, VbGet)
      If VarType(vItem) = vbString Then
        vItem = &quot;'&quot; &amp; vItem &amp; &quot;'&quot;
      End If
      xJRowToString = xJRowToString &amp; vItem
      If lCol &lt; rvResult.length - 1 Then
        xJRowToString = xJRowToString &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; vbTab
      End If
    Next lCol
    xJRowToString = xJRowToString &amp; &quot;]&quot;
    
  End Function

==cFunctions.cls==
Predefined functions for EvalDoc.  An instance of this class is provided to the JScript object to provide global functions for such things as matrix multiplication.  Provides an example of multilanguage programming: the application is written in VB, the document in JScript and the library used by JScript is written in VB.

  Option Explicit
    
  Public Enum enumFunctionErrors
    IncompatibleDimensions = vbObjectError + 1
    ChunkNotTerminated
    UnrecognizedMacro
  End Enum
  
The ErrorContextxxxx attributes are used to enable the errorhandlers to determine the location of the offending source code.  Statements are inserted in the code to set these values before the macros.

  Public ErrorContextStart_ As Long
  Public ErrorContextEnd_    As Long
  
Some of the functions need to be able to create variables on the fly so we must provide a reference to the object that is running the script. 
  
  Public oScriptControl  As ScriptControl 
  
Plot is a function that the document can call just as though it were a built in JScript function.  It produces an object that in turn is used to drive the ploticus charting program.  (Many Thanks to Steve Grubb &lt;http://ploticus.sourceforge.net&gt;).
  
The first argument is a matrix holding the data to be plotted and the second must be a string representing the ploticus command line except that it does not include data=datafilename, that is provided aiutomatically becuse we use a temporary file.
  
The matrix is written to a file then the a batch file is created to drive ploticus.  The ploticus file is executed to create a picture file.  The path to this picture file is stored in a cPlot object for later use.
  
Note that Ploticus is very particular about spaces in the command line:

This will fail:  'pl -gif -prefab scat x=1 y =2 data=12 -o 11

because the y =2 should say y=2, note the extra space.

  Public Function Plot(ByRef rvData As Variant, ByRef rsPlotCommands As String) As cPlot
  
    Set Plot = New cPlot
    Plot.PicFileName = TF &amp; &quot;.gif&quot;
    Dim sDataFileName As String
    sDataFileName = xSaveMatrix(rvData)
  
    RunCmd &quot;pl -gif &quot; &amp; rsPlotCommands &amp; &quot; data=&quot; &amp; sDataFileName &amp; &quot; -o &quot; &amp; Plot.PicFileName
    ' @TODO: check output of plot command for errors
  End Function

Ploticus reads its data from a file so we must write one.  We don't care what it is called and we can delete it afterwards so we create a unique file name.  Actually it is possible to create situations where this doesn't work but it is hard.  
  
  Public Function TF() As String
    TF = goFSO.BuildPath(gsTempFolder, Trim$(NextSerial))
  End Function
  

Because ploticus is a separate program we must start it and wait for it to finish.  This routine is a generic command line program executor.

For each parameter that expects an output file name use a macro of the form $(x) where x is the name of a variable that either contains a file name or is to receive an auto-generated file name.  The variable can be used later in other commands.  The user need not consider what the name actually is if it is used in a sequence of commands because the variable will be given a unique string value on first use that points into the temporary session folder.

If you need to provide a file as input and the data is held in a variable then construct the string by concatenating it with calls to the SaveData function; this writes the variable to a new temporary file and returns the file name.

For example you can drive ploticus like this:
  
:s=Cmd('pl -gif -prefab scat x=2 y=3 data=' + SaveData(b) + ' -o $f(plot)')

In this example s receives the output from standard out (if any) and a variable named plot names the file that will receive the ploticus picture.  If the plot variable is an empty string then a unique temporary file name will be created for it.

If you want to re-use a file name make sure that you clear it first unless you really want to use the same name again.
  
Macros are $x(args) where x is the name of the macro and args is whatever arguments the macro takes in whatever form in takes them.

  Public Function Cmd(ByRef rsCommandLine As String) As cPlot
  
    RunCmd rsCommandLine
    '  ' @TODO: check output of plot command for errors
  
  End Function

Ploticus needs the data for the plot in a file with a particular format.  The routine that starts ploticus needs to know the name of that file.  This function creates the file, writes the data to it and returns the file name.

  Private Function xSaveMatrix(rvData As Variant) As String
    xSaveMatrix = goFSO.BuildPath(gsTempFolder, Trim$(NextSerial)) &amp; &quot;.dat&quot;
    goFSO.OpenTextFile(xSaveMatrix, ForWriting, True).Write _
         JArrayToPlotData(rvData)
  
  End Function
  
The macros in the document create result records in the ''gaResults'' array by calling this function.

  Public Sub MakeResult(ByRef rvResult As Variant, _
                        ByRef rlStart As Long, ByRef rlLength As Long, _
                        ByRef reResultType As eResultType)
  
    With gaResults(glResultsCount)

Note that we can't use ''TypeOf'' to find out if the result is a JScript object because the type doesn't exist according to VB.  This is very strange because the ''Locals'' and ''Watch'' windows show it correctly so the ''IDE'' must know.  Use ''typeName'' instead, the disadvantage is that string comparisons are slower.

      If TypeName(rvResult) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot; Or IsObject(rvResult) Then
        Set .Value = rvResult
      Else
        .Value = rvResult
      End If
      .Start = rlStart
      .length = rlLength
      .ResultType = reResultType
    End With

Another exercise for the student: what happens if ''glresultsCount'' is greater than the upper bound of the array?  What should be done here?

    glResultsCount = glResultsCount + 1
 
  End Sub

The ''Show'' function is public so that JScript can call it.  The macro replacement process puts these calls in the source code replacing the macros.  At the moment this simply calls the ''Makeresult'' routine.  the reason for the wrapper is to facilitate more sophisticated error handling.

  Public Function Show(o As Variant, rlStart As Long, rlLength As Long)
  
    MakeResult o, rlStart, rlLength, Result
  
  End Function

Multiply to JScript matrices together and return another JScript matrix.  This is just a wrapper for the low level matrix multiplication routine.  This wrapper converts the incoming matrices from JScript to VB and the result from VB to JScript.

  Public Function Multiply(ra1 As Variant, ra2 As Variant) As Object
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
  
    Set Multiply = VBMatrixToJArray(xMultiply(JArrayToMatrix(ra1), JArrayToMatrix(ra2)))
  
    Exit Function
  
  ErrorHandler:
    MakeResult Empty, ErrorContextStart_, ErrorContextEnd_, SourceError
  End Function

This function multiplies two matrices.  It is called from the public function ''Multiply''.

The rules for multiplying matrices are given in [[Algebra/Matrix_operations|Matrix Operations]] in the [[Algebra/Matrix_operations|Algebra]] book.  This function is a straightforward implementation using essentialy the same notation as shown on that page.  The one notable difference is that our array indices extend from zero upwards instead of from one upwards.

  Public Function xMultiply(ByRef raA() As Double, ByRef raB() As Double) As Double()
    Dim j As Long
    Dim k As Long
    Dim m As Long
    Dim n As Long
    Dim p As Long
    Dim i As Long
    Dim aC() As Double
    Dim cij As Double

Remember that the ''Ubound'' function accepts an optional second argument that tells which dimension to return; the first dimension is number one, the second number two and so on.  Matrices have only two dimensions, the first is the row, the second is th column.

    n = UBound(raA, 2)
    m = UBound(raA, 1)
    p = UBound(raB, 2)
  
    ReDim aC(0 To n, 0 To p)
  
    For i = 0 To m
      For j = 0 To p
        nAcc = 0
        For k = 0 To n
          cij = cij + raA(i, k) * raB(k, j)
        Next k
        aC(i, j) = cij
      Next j
    Next i
  
    xMultiply = aC
  
    Exit Function
  
  End Function

==Exercises==
*The strategy of reading the results list from the end instead of the beginning is not guaranteed to work for all documents.  Can you explain why?  Hint, think of the different kinds of JScript statements that you could use.

==modJavaScript==
This module is for functions that help connect the JavaScript document to the Visual Basic world inside the program.

This implementation provides some simple matrix manipulation functions.  Because these are written in Visual Basic and the matrices must be written in JScript we need functions to convert between JScript objects and Visual Basic arrays.

  Option Explicit

JScript matrices are actually nested arrays.  Each row is a one dimensional array of elements and the matrix is also a one dimensional array where each element is an array.  This means that JScript matrices can be [[../Glossary#Ragged Array|ragged arrays]].  In Visual Basic it is usual to represent a matrix as a rectangular array.  In this implementation we shall simply assume that all rows in the array have the same number of elements so we can discover the number of rows by checking the count of the outer JScript array and the number of columns by checking the count of elements in the first row. 

This function converts a JScript array to a Visual Basic array.

  Public Function JArrayToMatrix(rvResult As Variant) As Double()
  
    Dim oRow As Variant
    Dim lRows As Long
    Dim lCols As Long

Finding the number of rows is easy because all JScript objects are in fact dictionaries and they all have a ''length'' property.  Getting the number of rows is slightly more complicated.  We must first get hold of the JScript object that is the first row.  Remember that JScript objects are actually dictionaries so arrays are dictionaries where the keys are numbers.  In the Script control this is mapped so that each item appears to be a property of the object so we can use CallByName to retrieve the value.  The name in this case is simply ''0'' (that's the numeral zero) because JScript arrays are numbered from ''zero'' to ''length - 1''.

    lRows = rvResult.length
    Set oRow = CallByName(rvResult, 0, VbGet)    
    lCols = oRow.length

Now we can allocate the Visual Basic array.  To avoid confusion we explicitly specify both the lower and upper bounds; this is good practice because it means that you don't have to wonder whether or not there is an ''Option Base'' statement at the top of the file.

    ReDim JArrayToMatrix(0 To lRows - 1, 0 To lCols - 1)

Now we simply enumerate the rows and copy the contents one row at a time into the array.

    Dim lRow As Long
    Dim vItem As Variant
    For lRow = 0 To lRows - 1
      Set oRow = CallByName(rvResult, lRow, VbGet)
      xJRowToMatrix JArrayToMatrix, lRow, oRow
    Next lRow
    
  End Function

In the interests of readability the copying of data from a row is performed in a separate routine.  Although, in this case, it doesn't add much readability it does serve to clearly distinguish the row operations from the column operations.  Note that this is a subroutine that accepts a ''reference'' to the target array and a ''row number'' because we cannot assign to a row in Visual Basic.

  Private Sub xJRowToMatrix(raMatrix() As Double, _
                            rlRow As Long, _
                            rvResult As Variant)
    
    Dim lCol As Long
    Dim vItem As Variant
    
    For lCol = 0 To rvResult.length - 1
      vItem = CallByName(rvResult, lCol, VbGet)
      raMatrix(rlRow, lCol) = vItem
    Next lCol
    
  End Sub

Converting from a Visual Basic array to a JScript matrix can be done by creating a snippet of JScript source code and evaluating it.  All we have to do is create a string that looks just as the user would type it.  Presumably direct manipulation of a JScript object would be faster, if anyone can find out how.

Note the late binding of the function result.  This is because the objects exposed by the Script Control seem to not implement the interfaces that Visual Basic needs.  This could be because of the extra layer of indirection provided by the Script Control.

  Public Function VBMatrixToJArray(raMatrix() As Double) As Object
    
    Dim lRow As Long
    Dim lCol As Long
    Dim sArray As String
    
    sArray = &quot;[&quot;
    For lRow = LBound(raMatrix, 1) To UBound(raMatrix, 1)
      sArray = sArray &amp; &quot;[&quot;
      For lCol = LBound(raMatrix, 2) To UBound(raMatrix, 2)
        sArray = sArray &amp; raMatrix(lRow, lCol)
        If lCol &lt; UBound(raMatrix, 2) Then
          sArray = sArray &amp; &quot;,&quot;
        End If
      Next lCol
      sArray = sArray &amp; &quot;]&quot;
      If lRow &lt; UBound(raMatrix, 1) Then
        sArray = sArray &amp; &quot;,&quot;
      End If
    Next lRow
    sArray = sArray &amp; &quot;]&quot;
    Set VBMatrixToJArray = goEvalDoc.moScriptControl.Eval(sArray)
    
  End Function

==cPlot.cls==
Represents a plot.  Allows the tostring function to decide what to do to display the plot.  The tostring function will use the filename property to find the picture file created by Ploticus and embed that into the rich text file.

  Option Explicit
  Public PicFileName As String
==modPlot.bas==
This module provides the low level connections to ploticus.

  Option Explicit

There are at least two ways to put a picture into a rich text box.  The one chosen here requires the least programming but has the disadvantage that it uses the Windows clipboard which is rather impolite because the user might have something in it at the time.  To do this we use the SendMessage API call which sends windows messages to window handles.

  Private Const WM_PASTE = &amp;H302&amp;
  
  Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib &quot;user32&quot; Alias &quot;SendMessageA&quot; _
          (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, _
           ByVal wParam As Long, lParam As Any) As Long

Insert the picture that was created by ploticus by loading it into the clipboard and then instructing the rich text box to paste it in.

  Public Sub InsertPicture(rsFile As String, rtfText As RichTextBox)
  
    Clipboard.Clear
    Clipboard.SetData LoadPicture(rsFile)
    
    SendMessage rtfText.hwnd, WM_PASTE, 0, 0&amp;
  
  End Sub

Ploticus needs a file of data in rows and columns.  This data is represented in our document as a matrix.  We must convert that matrix to a string and then save it to a file.  This function does the string conversion part.  

  Public Function JArrayToPlotData(rvResult As Variant) As String
    
    Debug.Assert TypeName(rvResult) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot;
    Dim oRow As Variant
    
    Dim lRow As Long
    For lRow = 0 To rvResult.length - 1
      Set oRow = CallByName(rvResult, lRow, VbGet)
      If TypeName(oRow) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot; Then
        JArrayToPlotData = JArrayToPlotData &amp; xJRowToPlotData(oRow)
      Else
        JArrayToPlotData = JArrayToPlotData &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; CallByName(rvResult, lRow, VbGet)
      End If
      If lRow &lt; rvResult.length - 1 Then
        JArrayToPlotData = JArrayToPlotData &amp; vbCrLf
      End If
    Next lRow
    JArrayToPlotData = JArrayToPlotData
    
  End Function

  Private Function xJRowToPlotData(rvResult As Variant) As String
  
    Dim oRow As Variant    
    Dim lCol As Long
    For lCol = 0 To rvResult.length - 1
      xJRowToPlotData = xJRowToPlotData &amp; CallByName(rvResult, lCol, VbGet)
      If lCol &lt; rvResult.length - 1 Then
        xJRowToPlotData = xJRowToPlotData &amp; &quot; &quot;
      End If
    Next lCol
    
  End Function

===Exercises===
The ''JArrayToPlotData'' is very similar to the function that converts a JScript matrix to a VB array.  rewrite ''JArrayToPlotData'' so that it uses that function instead of doing that conversion from JScript on its own.  Does this improve the program?  Hint: has the amount of code to be maintained been reduced or has duplication (or near duplication) of code been eliminated?

==modShellWait==
JArithmetic uses external programs to do some of the more complicated work.  These programs are often command line programs so we need some wrapper functions to make the rest of the program think that they are built in functions.

The original of this code was found on http://www.msfn.org/board/lofiversion/index.php/t35615.html.

  Option Explicit
  
  
  Private Const SYNCHRONIZE = &amp;H100000
  Public Const WAIT_OBJECT_0 = &amp;H0
  
  Private Declare Function OpenProcess Lib &quot;Kernel32.dll&quot; _
          (ByVal dwDA As Long, ByVal bIH As Integer, _
           ByVal dwPID As Long) As Long
  
  
  Private Declare Function WaitForSingleObject Lib &quot;kernel32&quot; _
          (ByVal hHandle As Long, _
           ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long) As Long
  
This function is the one used to execute an external program.  It waits no more than ten seconds (10000 milliseconds).  Unfortunately it does not know how to deal with failures.  This is left as an exercise for the student.

  Public Sub RunCmd(CmdPath As String)
   
    On Error GoTo Err_RunCmd
    
    If ShellWait(CmdPath, 10000) Then
      Stop ' error ' @TODO: do something useful here
    End If
    
    Exit Sub
    
  Err_RunCmd:
    Stop ' do something useful here
  End Sub
  
This is the lower level function that executes the command line and waits for a time specified in the call.  See [[../External_Processes|External Processes]].

  Function ShellWait(CommandLine As String, _
                     TimeOut As Long) As Boolean
     
    Dim ProcessID As Long
    Dim hProcess As Long

The Shell command returns a ProcessID which is not actually very useful because almost all Windows API functions use the ''Process Handle'', this isn't a problem though because the ''OpenProcess'' API function can translate between the two.

    ProcessID = Shell(CommandLine)

If the ''Process ID'' is non-zero then the process was created and started so we can just wait for it to complete.  To wait we use an API function called ''WaitForSingleObject'' that takes the ''Process Handle'' and a timeout in milliseconds.  This function simply waits until the process terminates or the timeout expires; it returns a status code to say which.

    If ProcessID Then

Non-zero (True) so Shell worked.  Now get a process handle for the PID (Wait takes a handle).

      hProcess = OpenProcess(SYNCHRONIZE, False, ProcessID)
      If hProcess Then
        Dim lResult As Long
        lResult = WaitForSingleObject(hProcess, TimeOut)
        If lResult = WAIT_OBJECT_0 Then
          ShellWait = True
        Else
          ShellWait = False
        End If
      Else

Failed to get process handle. This can happen if the process terminated very quickly or it might not really have executed at all even though Windows started a process.  Return ''false'' to the caller to say it failed.

        ShellWait = False

==modMain.bas==

The main module is the one that contains all the code that starts the application and gets it into its initial state.  In this case we also use it as a place to declare various constants and global functions.


  Attribute VB_Name = &quot;modMain&quot;
    
  Option Explicit

The constants ''gsFILE_FILTER'' and ''gsSAVE_AS_FILTER'' are used when we show the Common Dialog boxes to open and save files.  The tell the dialog which file masks to put in the combo box.  Notice that we have provided for ''rtf', ''txt'', all files.  This means that the user can open files that are plain text and save them as ''rtf''.  Of course the user can also attempt to open a file that isn't either text or rich text, we must cope with that.  The declarations are public because they are actually used in a different code module.

  Public Const gsFILE_FILTER As String = &quot;Rich text Format(*.rtf)|*.rtf|Text (*.txt)|*.txt|All Files (*.*)|*.*&quot;
  Public Const gsSAVE_AS_FILTER As String = &quot;Rich Text Format(*.rtf)|*.rtf|Text (*.txt)&quot;

The hard work is done by an instance of the ''cEvalDoc'' class'.  We never need more than one instance of this class so we declare it here as a global variable and ''instantiate'' it in the ''main'' subroutine.

  Public goEvalDoc As cEvalDoc

The ''macro'' processor needs to keep track of where in the text replacements are to occur and what the replacement actually is.  The ''tResult'' user defined type (''UDT'') is used to hold the necessary information.  Note that the ''Value'' member is declared as ''Variant'' because the result of an expression can be anything not just a number.

  Public Type tResult
    Value As Variant
    Start As Long
    length As Long
    ResultType As eResultType
  End Type
  
The result type is an ''enumerated'' type.  This makes the code easier to read.  Notice that none of the members has been explicitly assigned a value, this is because we don't care what the values are so long as they are distinct.  

  Public Enum eResultType
    SourceError
    SourceNoError
    Result
  End Enum

We need a place to store the values that we will substitute back in the text because we can't put them in untill we have finished processing the whole document.  The reason for this is that the length of the result might be different from the length of the text it replaces.  We maintain a count of the results so that we can let the ''gaResults'' array expand.  When we evaluate the document again we start off by simply resetting ''glresultsCount'' to zero; this saves time by not requiring the results array to be eallocated every time.

  Public gaResults() As tResult
  Public glResultsCount As Long

The ''FileSystemObject'' is much simpler to use than the older built in VB functions for reading files.  To use it you must have the ''Scripting Runtime Library'' installed.

  Public goFSO As FileSystemObject

Some of the functions used in this program need to create temporary files.  So that we are sure to avoid collisions between different instances of this program and with other programs we create a new temporary folder inside the system temporary folder and store its name in this variable.

  Public gsTempFolder As String

The ''main'' routine initialise the application.  It creates the temporary work area, creates an instance of the document evaluator, shows the main form and allocates the results array.

  Sub Main()
    Set goFSO = New FileSystemObject
    
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    
   
    ' Create temporary area for this instance of JArithmetic.
    gsTempFolder = Environ$(&quot;TEMP&quot;) &amp; &quot;\&quot; &amp; App.EXEName
    If Not goFSO.FolderExists(gsTempFolder) Then
      goFSO.CreateFolder gsTempFolder
    End If
    gsTempFolder = gsTempFolder &amp; &quot;\&quot; &amp; Format$(Now, &quot;yymmddhhmmss&quot;)
    If Not goFSO.FolderExists(gsTempFolder) Then
      goFSO.CreateFolder gsTempFolder
    End If
        
    Set goEvalDoc = New cEvalDoc
    
    Load fMainform
    
    fMainform.Show
    
    ReDim gaResults(0 To 100)
    
    Exit Sub
  ErrorHandler:
    Debug.Assert False
    MsgBox Err.Number &amp; &quot;, &quot; &amp; Err.Description &amp; &quot;. Command line = &lt;&quot; &amp; Command$ &amp; &quot;&gt;&quot;, vbOKOnly, &quot;Arithmetic&quot;
      Resume
  End Sub

The application can be closed in several different ways but each one should end with a call to this function so that all the documents are correctly closed.  So far there is no implementation of automatic saving, nor is the user prompted to save changed documents.  This is the place to add such code.

  Public Sub ExitApplication()
    Dim oForm As Form
    For Each oForm In Forms
      Unload oForm
    Next oForm    
  End Sub
  
  
This routine creates a unique number.  It is used by functions that need to create temporary files.  The result is always a whole number but we use ''Double'' instead of ''Long'' so that we 'never' run out of numbers (in this aplication this refinement is hardly necessary).

  Public Function NextSerial() As Double
    Static nSerial As Double
    nSerial = nSerial + 1
    NextSerial = nSerial
  End Function

==prjJarithmetic.vbp==

Here is the Visual Basic project file (''VBP'') used to tie all this together.  In principle it should be possible to automate the downloading and compilation of this.  Do bear in mind that any absolute paths you find in this VBP might not point to anything when copied to your computer.

Sorry to be fussy, but you should say that you are assuming that f and g have continuous first derivatives.

Also the last line &quot;This is equivalent to:&quot; the integral is correct.  But it is not quite the definition of the Riemann integral as it is usually given (as you have c_i and d_i instead of just c_i).  It works because \sqrt{a^2+b2} is continuous function of two variables.  I am not sure if it is worth mentioning it as it is a technicality.

If you want me to I can think if I can find a way around this problem [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 18:14, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">FileSets are ant's way of creating groups of files to do work on.  These files can be found in a directory tree starting in a base directory and are matched by patterns taken from a number of PatternSets and Selectors. 

FileSet identifies the base directory tree with its dir attribute.  Then the FileSet's enclosed pattern elements, both named (PatternSets) and selected by wildcards (Selectors), choose the files and folders within the base tree.

If any selector within the FileSet do not select a given file, that file is not considered part of the FileSet. This makes FileSets equivalent to an &lt;and&gt; selector container.

==Wildcards==
Wildcards are used by ant to specify groups of files that have a pattern to their names.
 
* ? is used to match any character. 
* * is used to match zero or more characters. 
* ** is used to match zero or more directories.

==Examples==
The below FileSets all select the files in directory ${server.src} that are Java source files without &quot;Test&quot; in their name.

 &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${server.src}&quot; casesensitive=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
   &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;exclude name=&quot;**/*Test*&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/fileset&gt;

 &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${server.src}&quot; casesensitive=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
   &lt;patternset id=&quot;non.test.sources&quot;&gt;
     &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;exclude name=&quot;**/*Test*&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/patternset&gt;
 &lt;/fileset&gt;

 &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${client.src}&quot;&gt;
  &lt;patternset refid=&quot;non.test.sources&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/fileset&gt;

 &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${server.src}&quot; casesensitive=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;filename name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;filename name=&quot;**/*Test*&quot; negate=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/fileset&gt;

 &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${server.src}&quot; casesensitive=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;filename name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;not&gt;
    &lt;filename name=&quot;**/*Test*&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/not&gt;
 &lt;/fileset&gt;

==Finally==
FileSets can appear as children of the project element or inside tasks that support this feature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One important question for transcendalists (historically, anyway) is that of natural disasters, such as earthquakes.  Can we equate natural disaster with evil caused by (a) god?  Insurance claims still refer to natural disasters as acts of god.  Answering this question forces a choice about omnipotence and omnibenevolence.  It would be nice to see some discussion of this in the article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Feedback: Ebay's feedback system is fairly easy to manipulate.  Unscrupulous sellers can wait until they get feedback from a buyer before they leave theirs--If a buyer leaves a negative, the seller can also leave a negative, then ask for mutual feedback removal.  

99% is suitable feedback, anything below 98% should be investigated by checking the feedback comments, and looking for neutrals and mutually-removed feedback.  Check for attitude, and check whoever gave the feedback.  [http://www.toolhaus.org/ Toolhause.org] has a great set of tools to find just the negative and neutral feedback.  Update--As of 2008, Ebay has changed how feedback is calculated, and removed the ability of sellers to leave negative for buyers.  It appears that this is resulting in overall lower feedback scores for buyers.  

Negative signs--These aren't _all_ reasons to avoid a deal, but if there are too many of them be cautious. 

Low number of transactions, but a non-standard, professional looking page layout. 

&quot;Easily repaired&quot;--Although this may be technically true, almost all repairs will involve servicing--Disassemble, clean, reassemble, lube and adjust, plus any replacement parts.  $40 is cheap for a proper servicing.  &quot;Easily repaired&quot; from a professional watch seller--if it is easy, why not get the repair done and sell it for more?

&quot;Overwound&quot;--Apparently this is intended to mean that someone wound the watch too much and the repair is simple.  There's no such thing as overwound--instead there is something that has kept the watch from unwinding.  This could be simple dirt, requiring a basic servicing, or damaged parts that have to be hand-made at great expense.  

&quot;Just needs a battery (no returns)&quot;. Likely true if it is an inexpensive quartz, otherwise be careful.  Especially true for Accutrons.  &quot;Works with test battery&quot; or &quot;will include new battery for $&quot; is probably OK.  'quits when face up/face down'--Probably a broken balance pivot or jewel.  

Blurry or tiny pictures:  Potluck.  Watches are difficult to accurately photograph.  If it is an occasional seller, or someone who specializes in a different type of item, it may be OK.  If they sell lots of watches, possibly hiding something.  I've had some very good luck buying items with bad pictures from people who don't sell watches regularly. 

Pay attention to shipping charges, and avoid sellers with excessive charges.   If no shipping is listed, always ask costs before bidding.  

Positive signs:

Picture of the movement, especially for vintage mechanicals.  Not so important for Timex or quartz.

Many clear pictures

Pointing out flaws

Returns accepted

High feedback, both percentage and number of transactions. 

Clear statement about running condition--&quot;Runs and keeps time&quot;, &quot;Keeps time to within XX per day&quot; &quot;Doesn't run, balance good&quot; &quot;Runs and stops&quot; (Assuming you can deal with whatever problems they say)


Watch lots:

It is fairly frequent that a batch of watches will sell for about the price of the best watch in the batch.  I will typically add up the minimum I think the watches will re-sell for individually, and bid accordingly.

If you are interested in any of the features listed below, '''''you''''' must take the responsibility of making sure they're requested on [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=21302&amp;atid=371302| SourceForge].


= Keyboard Commands =
== Customized Command Key Assignments ==
It might be useful if it were possible to specify customized command key assignments in a configuration file.
== Scripted Key Commands ==
It might be useful if it were possible to create user-defined key commands using Lua scripting.

:This already is possible. See the example script [[Celestia/Celx Scripting:Q&amp;A:Assigning Custom Key Functions with CELX|elsewhere]] in this WikiBook. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:43, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

= Time Controls =
== Change Time Flow Rate While Paused ==
It might be useful if it were possible to change the time flow rate while paused, so that when the pause is ended time would flow at the new rate.

:This is possible in Celestia v1.4.1 ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:44, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

== GOTO Spacecraft In Time ==
Currently, one needs to look at the SSC file to see when a spacecraft begins (such as Mir). Doctorjoe created a simple patch, which I have applied to my OS X builds without a problem, that shows the start and end times of a spacecraft in the view window. In addition, hitting shift-G, takes you to the spacecraft's temporal and physical location.

I have this patch now... and would be happy to send it to anyone who wants to try incorporating it into CVS (contact: BlindedByTheLight).

Furthermore, it might be cool to allow more than just two dates (start and end) to appear in the view. Various spacecrafts have SEVERAL temporal points of interest. Perhaps changing the code so that people could declare various times with text labels...


Start Time: 34747373.4234234

Start Text: &quot;Ship takes off&quot;


Date1: 35343434.2343

Date1Text: &quot;Ship passes the moon&quot;


Date2: 35324344.2343223

Date2Text: &quot;Ship circles Jupiter&quot;


End Time: 342423434

End Text: &quot;Ship crashes into Io&quot;


Then a keyboard shortcut to go to each successive point in time...? Would be cool and would open up a whole new world for add-ons designers.

= Render Options =
== Improved illumination phase functions ==
It might be nice to allow planet/satellite illumination functions to vary dependent on the surface type. Presently objects like Jupiter are more realistic with the default lambert function. Solid surfaces are less realistic and might be improved with a type of &quot;lunar lambert&quot; function.
== Improved distance filters ==
It might be nice to allow distance filters for any object, not only stars. When you have a populated system, it's annoying see all/none names/orbits. It could be possible show only largest/important/brightest names/orbits of objects from your FOV.
== Display coordinates ==
It might be useful to show galactic and equatorial coordinates.
== Display apparent magnitude for planetary bodies ==
It would be interesting to have the apparent magnitude of the selected planetary body displayed. The program already performs these calculations, for instance, to set the scale of the planetary scaled discs, so I assume it wouldn't be too difficult to add this information to the planetary information display.

== Display axis ==
It might be useful to show rotation axis of bodies which I selected to see their orbits.
== Display speed/forces ==
It might be useful to show ship's speed/forces (angular and radial) when I do a follow/sync orbit/track selection.
== Create visual filters ==
It might be wonderful to apply filters: select between infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma spectrum, simple polarized colors, aberration of light, high level of ambiental light. A stereographic mode, for use with red-cyan glasses, could be excellent (StarStrider have this).
== Improved real-time clouds ==
It might be nice to update clouds from public databases.

= View Controls =
== Zoom to Fill ==
It might be useful if there were a key command to cause the view to zoom so that the selected object fills the screen. Then the user could select an object of small apparent size (by onscreen picking or keying-in its name), press a key to center it in the view, and press another key to zoom the view so the object fills the screen. This would be more convenient than manual zooming.
== Select Orbits ==
It might be useful if you can select which orbits (from one group) you will see (if orbits turned on) - for example only from objects with a special size.&lt;br /&gt;
Especially if you have many asteroids in you Solar System Browser it becomes very complex in the presentation. An alternativ or additionally it might be useful to group orbits close to each other in a &quot;fuzzy&quot; orbit - similary to the rings of a planet.
== Third-Person View ==
It might be useful if you can see from perspective an Official Celestial Ship for navigation.

= Solar System Browser =
== Presentation ==
It might be useful if you can categorise and / or group planets and asteroids, so that a list doesn't become too complex.
== Proximity lists ==
It would be interesting to have a list of the closest objects to the current position not only in the star browser, but also in the planetary one. It would be even more interesting if the program included a function that returned the closest approaches to a given body (or between two bodies of choice) in a given interval.

= Orbits =
== Galactic Orbits (stellar proper motion) ==
It might be useful if galactic orbits could be simulated based on stellar proper motion where available.
== Segmented Orbits ==
It might be useful if orbits could be defined with multiple segments, combining elliptical orbit segments with different elements, xyz files, etc.
Also if orbits for objects could be made up of different ephemeris data blocks. i.e. so the orbit is correct for various dates of interest. This would be useful when considering planet/moon events and spacecraft missions etc. At the moment using beginning and ending nearly works but celestia then has multiple objects with the same name and does not switch to the visible object of the same name at the specified ending of the objects life. Hence the satellite/Moon/asteroid disappears and the new object pops up but is not traked only the &quot;ghost&quot; object.
== Horseshoe and Tadpole Orbits ==
It might be useful if horseshoe and tadpole orbits could be specified.
== SPICE Orbits ==
It might be useful if orbits could be specified using NASA's SPICE files.

:SPICE orbits will be supported in Celestia v1.5.0. They already can be used in its prereleases. See the documentation [[Celestia/Trajectories|elsewhere]] in this WikiBook. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:49, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

== Horizons Orbit Data Extraction Tool ==
It might be useful if there were a tool for extracting orbit data from JPL's Horizons system into a Celestia-compatible format.
== Critical Interval Orbit Overrides ==
It might be useful if there were a way to specify xyz data for higher-precision during critical time intervals (e.g. spacecraft flybys) while using less precise orbital data at other times.
== Multiple Star Orbit Display ==
It might be useful if orbits could be displayed for binary/multiple stars.

:This already is possible in Celestia v1.4.1. See the documentation [[Celestia/STC File|elsewhere]] in this WikiBook. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:51, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

== Detect collisions ==
It might be useful if I could select 2 bodies and calculate past and future collisions as Eclipse Finder. Or merge both as an &quot;Events Finder&quot; with alerts.
== Extended eclipse finder ==
It would be real neat to have an extended eclipse finder, able to find them for any body, not just the predefined ones.

= Browser =
== Show Stars and Planets around Barycenters ==
It might be useful if it would be possible in the Star Browser to select the barycenter of a binary and then see the corresponding stars with subsequent planets or planets around the barycenter.

== Improved search ==
It might be useful if you can search a name and see all objects which matches it (in any part of the word). And could be interesting show all known names from an object (for example, 2003 UB313 / Xena)

= Label Display =
== Star Labels ==
=== Star Label Density Control ===
It might be useful if it were possible for the user to control the density of star labels, e.g. with a magnitude limit.
=== Catalog Preference for Star Labels ===
It might be useful if it were possible for the user to specify a precedence ordering of catalogs for selecting which star labels to use.
= Data Loading =
== Reload Data Without Restart ==
It might be useful if it were possible to reload the data without restarting the program. This would make it more convenient to test incremental changes to data. Such a reload should be able to reload one file, one directory or all of the data.

= Scripting =
== CEL Scripting ==
== CELX Scripting ==
=== Disable User Inputs During Script ===
It might be useful if there were a script command to disable user inputs while the script is running. Another script command could reenable inputs if desired. The inputs wouild be reenabled automatically when the script ends, and of course the &quot;escape&quot; key to abort the script would always be enabled.

=== Write Messages to Log from Script ===
It might be useful if were possible to write messages to the log from a script.

=== Display Error Messages in Log ===
It might be useful if scripting error messages were displayed in the log.

= Views =
== Save Multiple Views in Celestia URLs ==
It might be useful if multiple views could be saved in a Celestia URL. This would make it possible to easily restore a desired view layout.

== Separate Rendering Flag Settings for Each View ==
It might be useful if Celestia allowed separate rendering flag settings for separate views. This would make it possible, for example, to show orbits in one view but not another.
== Default Bookmarks ==
It might be useful to create default views such as solar system view from above.

= Data Files =
== Merge STC and SSC file formats ==
At present Celestia requires separate file formats for stars (STC) and other bodies (SSC). It would work better if these were combined into a single file format with features of both.

== Planetary Barycenters ==
The modelling of planets with large moons is unrealistic because the barycenter of the planet-moon system is always the center of the planet. If a barycenter for a planet-moon system could be specified, the motion of the planet and moon can be modelled more accurately. Examples of systems that can be modelled correctly with this new feature would be Pluto-Charon, Earth-Moon, and certain binary asteroids.

:''I believe you can currently create barycenters for planets/moon/asteroids, just not in .ssc files. They have to go in .stc files. Granted, this is an inconvenience.''

::The Class &quot;invisible&quot; hack was defined long ago for just this purpose. Celestia v1.5.0 adds the ReferencePoint directive for use in SSC files. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:56, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

== Local InfoUrls ==
Local InfoUrls: have Celestia check local directories for InfoUrl files (html/cel/celx) before trying to look it up on the www. Alternatively, allow local InfoURL files to be specified explicitly.

:This latter capability already exists. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:58, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

== Spectral Light Emission ==
Implement a method to change the spectral color of stars in the STC. If for example you want to create a green star you can now add a green star texture with the &quot;texture&quot; command, but the halo of the star still has the color of the originally selected type i.e. &quot;G2V&quot;. So the star doesn't look right.
Perhaps a command with [R G B] values for this could be added.
:See: &quot;Why aren't there any green stars?&quot; [http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q72.html] Briefly, stars are black body radiators, so the spectral emission of a star is determined by its temperature. Stars emit light at essentially all wavelengths across the spectrum. We perceive color based on the wavelengths to which the receptor cells in our eyes are sensitive. Black body spectra don't have the proper proportion of radiation at different wavelengths to cause our eyes to perceive the light as green.

== Multiple Names in the SSC ==
It might be useful if the objects in the SSC allowed multiple names like stars. This would make it possible, for example, to select asteroids by not only its name but also the number. And this allows enabling translation of the objects' name into various languages keeping original English name.
== Customized body categories ==
(I'm not sure where this one fits best. Feel free to move around)
It would be useful to be able to set up customized object categories, for instance, to separate main body asteroids from TNOs or dwarf planets, or whatever the user sees fit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Isn't the Many to Many recursive diagram incorrect? Surely one set of crows feet should be on the package and another on the activity. - Peter Johnson - peter.johnson@screechlaboratories.co.uk

*Use a similar example throughout the chapter for the 1:1, 1:M, and M:M sections. Perhaps one that relates to business.

*Bold key words and start with clear definition after each.

*Follow author guidelines to revise chapter.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;b&gt;XML: Managing Data Exchange/Recursive relationships - Editorial Board revisions - Viji&lt;/b&gt;

* remove the XSL items from the Learning Objectives

'''Introduction'''

&quot;... such as a one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many&quot; - those are the only relationships that we have studied so far, therefore using &quot;such as&quot; does not really make sense.



* Where (and if) appropriate change the headings that read &quot;one to one model&quot; to &quot;one to one recursive model&quot; etc.

'''a look at new elements''' - change to '''New schema elements''' 

* bold the element tags just to highlight them and set them apart

* also follow the tag with its definition then set a break before the rest of the explanation / examples
 
* what does &quot;On {32}... &quot; mean? Does it mean line 32?  Since there are no line numbers and we are not using line numbers because they really don't match up, find another way of referencing the code line (if infact that is what is going on here).  you can even copy and paste the code refered to here
--- that same sentence should probably read &quot;only one&quot; instead of &quot;one only&quot;
 
* &quot;Experiment with changing the predecessor value on of the XML file above to “1”, and you will see that the file will not validate!&quot; - include where in the XML document, which variable must be changed to &quot;1&quot;.
 
* xpath is introduced for the first time here, please give a brief definition or description - it does not have to be exacting, it can be general - also do this before the &lt;xsd:unique&gt; element, mentioning that it will come later in the paragraph

''' change examples to fit with the tourguide model '''

(one to one recursive: perhaps use changes in the names of cities (like Istanbul was Constantinopal) but you would need at least three names; or from the previous 1:1 chapter example you could say that the top destination changes every year and make a recursive relationship from that)

(one to many recursive: perhaps use a state and cities and a city that is the state capital - ignore the bit about some countries somewhere with two capitals - you can make it smaller, perhaps 2 states with 4 cities one of which is the capital)

(many to many recursive: perhaps use a tourist package with air flights, hotel nights, museum trips, sightseeing, etc. which can be bought separately or in various packages)

* once again I think line numbers are being used ({41} and {18 - 21}), refer to the code in another way - you can even copy and paste the code refered to here

Remember to move the exercises to another link and link to answers - refer to the single entity chapter for the format.

Thank you!

==Professor's comments==
The examples in this chapter need to be redone using ID and IDREF to make them simpler. Some of the prior comments (e.g., defining Xpath) will not be appropriate as a result.
The tour examples are a good idea to keep with the tourism theme.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Reverse Engineering Chapter}}

This section will talk about reverse-engineering proprietary file formats. Many software developers need to reverse engineer a proprietary file format, especially for the purposes of interoperability. For example, every year the Open Office project needs to reverse engineer the Microsoft Office file formats. Furthermore, reverse engineering is required for forensics purposes. The chapters in this section will talk about how to understand a proprietary file format.

{{TODO|This entire section is in need of some help and contributions. If you know anything about this field of study, please help and contribute. This chapter might eventually even include a discussion on reverse-engineering file systems.}}

== Typical Features ==

=== File Header ===
Most file formats begin with a &quot;header,&quot; a few bytes that describe the file type and version.
Because there are several incompatible file formats with the same extension (for example, &quot;.doc&quot; and &quot;.cod&quot;), the header gives a program enough additional information to see if this file is one of the formats that program can handle.

Many programmers package their data in some sort of &quot;container format&quot; before writing it out to disk.
If they use the standard zlib to hold their data in compressed form, the file will begin with the 2 bytes 0x1f 0x8b (in decimal, 31 139 ).

=== Blank Space ===
Some files are made up largely of blank space, for example, .ds_store files generated by OS X. Blank space will appear as a series of 0's in a hex editor. The creators of a file format may add blank space for a variety of reasons, for example, the author of [https://wiki.mozilla.org/DS_Store_File_Format this study] on .ds_store files speculated that they exist to speed up writing data, as other data would not need to be pushed around to make room. They could also serve to prevent fragmentation.

For most purposes, blank space can be ignored.

== Tools ==

File format reverse engineering is the hour of [[Reverse_Engineering/Hex Editors|hex editors]]. Typically they are used more often to display file contents as opposed to editing them. Hex editors allow you to superimpose a data structure on top of the data (sometimes called ''custom views'' or similar), which are very helpful. Once a particular structure has been discovered in a file, these mechanisms can be used to document the structure, as well as to provide a more meaningful display of the information than just hex code.

Also useful are Unix/Linux tools like '''strings'''(1) and '''file'''(1).

;strings:Finds and prints sequences of printable characters in a file. This can give hints of what data is embedded in the file.
;file:Attempts to determine a file type. Sometimes file format designers re-use already well known file formats or file compression algorithms. There is a small but notable chance that '''file'''(1) can reveal this.

Windows ports of these tools are also available. E.g. as part of the [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin] environment (''strings'' is part of the ''binutils'', don't ask ...).

Equally important as a hex editor is a brain. File format reverse engineering means to reason about what the hex editor and other tools displays. To guess structures, relations and the meaning of the data, to develop theories and then verify them. Very few tools can help here.

In a few limited cases additional tools are helpful. E.g. for checking brute-force if a particular part of the file consists of some embedded, compressed data. Typically such tools are written or scripted on the fly as custom tools. Another typical set of custom tools are  the ones which are used to break up a file into separate components - once it has been discovered that a particular file indeed consists of separate parts, and how they are separated in the file. C/C++, Java, but also scripting languages like [[wikipedia:Perl|Perl]] are often used here (Perl because it can handle binary data, while classic Unix scripting tools are often limited to text data only).

In some cases a proprietary file format might contain executable code. For example, a firmware update file for some embedded device very likely contains executable code. Typically that code is wrapped into some structure, e.g. a file system, compressed, garnished with boot/flash code etc. In such cases a disassembler/decompiler for the particular executable format might be helpful.

Further, documentation of and familiarity with checksum algorithms, compression algorithms, encoding techniques, and also programming languages is very helpful.

Also very helpful is the availability of the application that produces and reads the proprietary file format. That application can be used to create test files, but also [[#Probing|to verify if an own generated file is correct]].

== Strategies ==

Look for the obvious first. E.g. magic numbers, a block structure, ASCII text in the file. Anything that can be more or less identified clearly can be the entry ticket to more. Once a particular structure has been identified, look for in-file pointers to that data. E.g. if the data is referenced from some other part of the file with an absolute or relative address.
It is also very important to find out the byte order (little endian or big endian).

===Choosing the target===
If you have access to the software that created the file, you can always create files with the contents of your choosing. This makes reverse engineering substantially easier. In cryptography terms, you are engaging in a [[w:chosen-plaintext attack]].

=== Probing ===
Once you formulate theory as to what some data in the file might mean, you can verify that theory by creating a manipulated file. Replace it with some other data using a hex editor or a custom tool. Then load the manipulated file into the original application. If the application loads the file and displays the intended change, the theory is probably correct.

== Compression, Encryption &amp; Scrambling ==

=== Introduction ===
File formats which are either in part or completely compressed, encrypted or scrambled are among the toughest nuts to crack. Of course, compression is different from encryption, and typically done for a different purpose. However, the resulting file formats often look similar: A bunch of gibberish. This is the intended result when file format designers go for encryption, but it is also often a desired side effect when compression is applied.

{{Warning|Please note: [[Wikibooks:Legal_disclaimer|Wikibooks does not give legal opinions]]}}

If checking a file with a hex editor or similar reveals that it just contains gibberish and e.g. not any easy to identify text strings, patterns or similar, it might indicate that the particular file is compressed, encrypted or scrambled. The methods for reverse engineering these files are similar. There might, however, be a big difference from a legal point of view. Many countries have laws against circumventing copy protection, and encryption can be seen as some kind of copy protection. See [[Reverse Engineering/Legal Aspects]] for some more hints regarding this, and seek qualified legal advice before attempting to reverse engineer an encrypted or otherwise protected file format. Similar issues might arise when a file format just uses scrambling. The format &quot;owner&quot; might argue that the scrambling is used as some kind of copy protection, encryption or whatever, and circumventing it might break some law. Again, seek qualified legal advice.

The remainder of this section only deals with reverse-engineering the compression of a file. This is typically just an initial step in the complete reverse-engineering process. Once it has been successfully decompressed, other reverse engineering methods need to be applied to identify the file contents and structure.

=== Well-Known Compression Algorithms ===

Often file format designers apply well known compression algorithms. Either in the form of even using a particular, well known implementation of a certain algorithm (a well-known tool), or by re-implementing a well known algorithm unchanged. In the easiest case this has been documented. For example, it is well documented that the OpenOffice file format uses ZIP archives, and therefore there is no point in reverse engineering that format.

Unfortunately, for many formats we don't have this documentation. In case a well-known implementation of a particular algorithm has been used it is often relatively easy to reverse engineer. Such compressed file formats tend to start with a format identifier (''magic number''), clearly identifying the particular compressed format. The compression tool has left its &quot;fingerprint&quot; in place.

{{Example|The following is a hex dump of the first few bytes of a fictitious firmware update file for a particular SOHO router

The file is compressed with &lt;tt&gt;ARJ&lt;/tt&gt;. Not only does the string ''DTA.ARJ'' give it away for the human eye, but also the first two bytes &lt;tt&gt;60 ea&lt;/tt&gt;, which are known to identify ARJ-compressed files.

The Unix/linux tool '''file'''(1) is quite aware of many standard compressed file formats.
{{Example|'''file''' returns the following for the above mentioned firmware file
 firmware.bin: ARJ archive data, v6, slash-switched, original name: DTA.ARJ, os: MS-DOS
}}

The next steps after the compression format has been discovered is obvious: To obtain a version of the used compression tool and to use it to decompress the data. The result, however, often needs more reverse engineering. For example, the above mentioned router firmware might contain separate sections for separate areas of the router's flash memory, each guarded with an own checksum.

A variant of using a well known compression algorithm and tool can also sometimes be found, which is more difficult to reverse engineer. In such a case the file is prefixed with some additional data, and the actual compression format can't be identified by just checking the file format. Lets assume, for example, another fictitious SOHO router's firmware update file, which is build as it follows:
{{Example|Fictitious structure of another SOHO router firmware update file:
 +--------------------------+
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;  Boot loader             &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 +--------------------------+
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;  Decompression algorithm &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 +--------------------------+
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;  Compressed data         &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 +--------------------------+
}}

Of course, the format can only be known once the file format has been reverse engineered. So how is that done? Well, in the fictitious case we assume that an inspection with the Unix/Linux tool '''strings'''(1) reveals the following interesting strings in the file:

{{Example|Abridged output of '''strings''':
 :
 :
 unknown compression method
 invalid window size

}}

The strings are very revealing, and those knowledgeable will recognize the name ''Mark Adler'' as one of the authors of &lt;tt&gt;zlib&lt;/tt&gt; [http://www.zlib.net/ &lt;tt&gt;zlib&lt;/tt&gt;], which is the base for &lt;tt&gt;info-zip&lt;/tt&gt; as well as GNU's [http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ &lt;tt&gt;gzip&lt;/tt&gt;]. Those not so knowledgeable might at least have the idea to search for the name and the keyword compression.

It is a good bet to assume that at least parts of the file are ZIP compressed. Further probing might reveal that the file does not contain a complete ZIP archive, but just a section which is compressed with the ZIP &lt;tt&gt;deflate&lt;/tt&gt; algorithm, and supposed to be decompressed with the ZIP &lt;tt&gt;inflate&lt;/tt&gt; algorithm (likely version 1.1.3, as the output of '''strings''' revealed). Therefore, the fictitious file might be further separated into its components by using a custom tool which iteratively applies the &lt;tt&gt;inflate&lt;/tt&gt; algorithm to the file, until the generated result makes some sense (e.g. until the result contains some recognizable clear text strings).

=== Unknown or homemade Compression Algorithms ===

All bets are off if there is an unknown or homemade/ad-hoc compression algorithm, or a non-standard implementation of a known algorithm. One has to be exceptionally lucky to figure out the details of the applied algorithm, so the accompanying decompression algorithm can be constructed, although cryptologists strongly discourage the use of ad-hoc encryption schemes, as they typically do not stand up to serious cryptanalysis.

Sometimes additional information can be found. E.g. if a vendor has filed a patent application for a particular algorithm, or is known to have fallen in love with a particular compression technology in other products, e.g. communication protocols. Sometimes it might turn out that the file format actually belongs to some OEM or 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party product, and that information about that product is available.

Otherwise, there is a small chance that trial-and-error might reveal something about the file. e.g. run-length encodings are a popular, simple and easy to implement compression algorithm, so they can sometimes be found in homemade implementations. It might be worth a try to investigate if a file might be compressed that way. An investigation of a few other well known compression techniques might also be worth a try.

Last but not least, crypto-analysis techniques might reveal something interesting about the compression. E.g. reoccurring blocks of information might point to a particular compression algorithm. However, this requires a lot of effort, time and skill.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Folkstyle Wrestling is the form of Wrestling that is practiced mostly in American high schools and colleges.  It is also known as collegiate wrestling.  The object of folkstyle wrestling is to pin your opponent.  Failing this, you want to get as many points as possible. 

Folkstyle scoring focuses mainly on changes in control. Taking an opponent down to the mat, escaping from or reversing control, or turning an opponent's back to the mat are all scoring situations. This differs from other styles such as Freestyle or Greco Roman, which don't encourage escapes or reversals.

The scoring for folkstyle wrestling is as follows:  turn an opponents back to the mat for 3 seconds, score 2 points.  Hold him for 5 seconds, and you earn 3 points .  In a takedown, once you gain control of your opponents hips and they have 3 points of balance (arms and legs) on the mat, you earn 2 points.  If they can reverse the position so that they have control of your hips, they earn 2 points.  If they simply get away so that you both are standing with no one in control, it is called an escape and they earn one point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Objective==
There are three basic victory conditions in a wrestling match:
*Pinning your opponent (Win By Fall)
*Scoring more points than your opponent in the time alotted (Win By Decision)
*Scoring 15 points more than your opponent at any point during the match (Win By Technical Fall)
**In team tournaments and meets, different points are awarded to the team, depending on whether or not a pin occurred, how large the point spread was at the end of the match one.

==The Format==
*Three periods
**Can be different amount of time for periods depending on the league
***For College the Norm is usually 3-2-2
***For High School the Norm is usually 2-2-2
***For Modified and Youth the Norm is usually 1-1-1

==The Four Positions==
*Neutral
*Referee's Position
**Top
***Optional/Freestyle
**Bottom
==Ways to Score==
There are 5 ways to score-

*Takedown- Defined as taking opponent from feet to mat.  This is worth 2 points.

*Escape- Defined as escaping opponent's control and facing him.  This is worth one point.

*Reversal- Defined as coming from mat, and taking opponent to mat, in a single move/move combo, which is worth 2 points.

*Nearfall- Points gained when opponent's back/shoulders break the 45 degree plane with respect to the mat for a duration of time.  A two-four count awards you 2 points, then a 5 count awards you 3 points.
*Riding Time-Defined as being in control on the mat, for a long period of time, usually used in collegiate wrestling.  If one wrestler has more than 1 minute more of riding time than his opponent, he is awarded 1 point at the end of regulation time.

==Penalties==

*Stalling
**Fleeing the mat

*Slams
*locking hands around waist on ground without 2points of body

Note:(When a wrestler lifts another off the mat, it is the lifting wrestler's responsibility to ensure the other's safe return to the mat.)

*Locking hands strictly around an opponent's waist while on the mat.

*Potentially Dangerous
**Choking
**Full Nelson
**Body Figure Four
**Head Scissors
**Chicken wing (extended past a certain point)
**Arm across the back above 90 Degrees

*Unsportsmanlike conduct
**Swearing
**Striking
**Unnecessary Roughness
**Grabbing of the singlet
**Throwing your headgear
**physically hurting your opponent for revenge of previous match
**Smack Talking

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bode Plots ==
Bode plots plot the transfer function. Since the transfer function is a complex number, both the magnitude and phase are plotted (in polar coordinates). The independent variable &amp;omega; is swept through a range of values that center on the major defining feature such as time constant or resonant frequency. A magnitude plot has dB of the transfer function magnitude on the vertical axis. The phase plot typically has degrees on the vertical axis.

[[File:Example45B.png|thumb|voltage across capacitor and resistor parallel combination is the output]]
[[File:Example45bode1.png|thumb|Bode plot for V&lt;sub&gt;CR&lt;/sub&gt; compared to V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; which looks like a passive, low pass filter with slope of -40dB/decade, the cut off frequency looks to be 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 radian/sec. The resistor dominates at DC and the capacitor dominates at very high frequencies. ]]
[[File:Example14Transfer.png|thumb|find current through R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
== MatLab tr and bode ==
===Example 1===
[[Circuit_Theory/TF_Objectives#Applications|Previously]] the transfer function was found to be:
:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{\mathbb{V}_{cr}(s)}{\mathbb{V}_s(s)} = \frac{1}{CLs^2 + \frac{Ls}{R} + 1} = \frac{1}{s^2 + 2s + 1} &lt;/math&gt;
MatLab has a short hand notation method for entering this information where the coefficients are listed (high power to low power)(numerator first, then denominator). For this example
&lt;pre&gt;
f = tf([1],[1 2 1])
&lt;/pre&gt;
Leaving the colon off the end should display the transfer function.
The next step is to plot it:
&lt;pre&gt;
grid on
bode(f)
&lt;/pre&gt;
The result is a low pass filter. Rather than understand how to create these plots (not trivial), the goal is to interpret the plot .. (which is almost the same thing). But at this point, the goal is to exercise MatLab. 
[[File:Example14Bode.png|thumb|Bode diagram of R3 current versus V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, looks like a notch filter at around 1K radians/sec]]
===Example 2===
[[Circuit_Theory/TF_Examples|Previously]] the transfer function was found to be:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{I}_o}{\mathbb{V}_s} = \frac{1000s^3 + 5*10^9s}{s^4 + 5*10^6*s^3 + 2.000015*10^{12}*s^2 + 3.5*10^{13}*s + 5*10^{13}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
f = tf([1000 0 5*10^9 0],[1 5*10^6 2.000015*10^12 3.5*10^13 5*10^13])
grid on
bode(f)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Magnitude Graph ===
Bode magnitude plots are dB which is both a measure of power and voltage and current simultaneously. The vertical dB axis is not an approximation or relative to anything. The vertical axis is an accurate number. The horizontal, dependent axis could be radians/sec or Hz.

=== Phase Graph ===

The Bode Phase Plot is a graph where the radial frequency is plotted along the X axis, and phase shift of the circuit ''at that frequency'' is plotted on the Y-axis. Axis could be in radians or degrees, frequency could be in radians per second or Hz.

== Poles and Zeros ==
A transfer function has 7 features that can be realized in circuits. Before looking at these features, the terms pole, zero and origin need to be defined. Start with this definition of a transfer fuction:
:&lt;math&gt;H(j\omega) = \frac{Z(j\omega)}{P(j\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;
*Zeros are roots in the numerator.
*Poles are roots in the denominator.
*The origin is where s = j&amp;omega; = 0 (no real part in a Bode analysis). When the frequency is zero, the input is DC. This is where after a long time caps open and inductors short. 

The 7 possible features in a transfer function are:
*A constant 
*Zeros at the origin (s in the numerator)
*Poles at the origin (s in the denominator)
*Real Zero (an s+a factor in the numerator)
*Real Pole (an S+a factor in the denominator)
*Complex conjugate poles
*Complex conjugate zeros

The bode and bodeplot functions are available in the [http://www.mathworks.com/products/control/ MatLab Control system toolbox]. [http://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Bode/BodeFiles.html BodePlotGui] does the same thing and is discussed here. BodePlotGui was developed at Swarthmore through an NSF grant. There is a summary of the [http://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Bode/Bode.html Swathmore Bode Diagram tutorial].

Circuit simulation software can plot bode diagrams [https://www.circuitlab.com/circuit/s5c7k7/p9-5/ also].

== Bode Equation Format ==

let us say that we have a generic transfer function with poles and zeros:

:&lt;math&gt;H(j\omega) = \frac{(\omega_A + j\omega)(\omega_B + j\omega)}{(\omega_C+ j\omega)(\omega_D + j\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;

Each term, on top and bottom of the equation, is of the form &lt;math&gt;(\omega_N + j\omega)&lt;/math&gt;. However, we can rearrange our numbers to look like the following: 

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_N(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_N})&lt;/math&gt;

Now, if we do this for every term in the equation, we get the following:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{bode}(j\omega) = \frac{\omega_A \omega_B}{\omega_C \omega_D}
      \frac{(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_A})(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_B})}
           {(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_C})(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_D})}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the format that we are calling &quot;Bode Equations&quot;, although they are simply another way of writing an ordinary frequency response equation.

== DC Gain ==

The constant term out front:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_A \omega_B}{\omega_C \omega_D}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the &quot;DC Gain&quot; of the function. If we set &lt;math&gt;\omega \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, we can see that everything in the equation cancels out, and the value of H is simply our DC gain. DC then is simply the input with a frequency of zero.

== Break Frequencies ==

in each term:

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_N})&lt;/math&gt;

the quantity &lt;math&gt;\omega_N&lt;/math&gt; is called the &quot;Break Frequency&quot;. When the radial frequency of the circuit equals a break frequency, that term becomes (1 + 1) = 2. When the radial frequency is much higher than the break frequency, the term becomes much greater than 1. When the radial Frequency is much smaller than the break frequency, the value of that term becomes approximately 1.

=== Approximations ===
Bode diagrams are constructed by drawing straight lines (on log paper) that approximations of what are really curves. Here is a more precise definition. 

The term &quot;much&quot; is a synonym for &quot;At least 10 times&quot;. &quot;Much Greater&quot; becomes &quot;At least 10 times greater&quot; and &quot;Much less&quot; becomes &quot;At least 10 times less&quot;. We also use the symbol &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; to mean &quot;is much less than&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; to mean &quot;Is much greater than&quot;. Here are some examples:

*1 &lt;&lt; 10
*10 &lt;&lt; 1000
*2 &lt;&lt; 20 Right!
*2 &lt;&lt; 10 WRONG!

For a number of reasons, Electrical Engineers find it appropriate to approximate and round some values very heavily. For instance, manufacturing technology will never create electrical circuits that perfectly conform to mathematical calculations. When we combine this with the &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; operators, we can come to some important conclusions that help us to simplify our work:

If A &lt;&lt; B:
*A + B = B
*A - B = -B
*A / B = 0

All other mathematical operations need to be performed, but these 3 forms can be approximated away. This point will come important for later work on bode plots.

Using our knowledge of the Bode Equation form, the DC gain value, Decibels, and the &quot;much greater, much less&quot; inequalities, we can come up with a fast way to approximate a bode magnitude plot. Also, it is important to remember that these gain values are not constants, but rely instead on changing frequency values. Therefore, the gains that we find are all ''slopes'' of the bode plot. Our slope values all have units of &quot;decibel per decade&quot;, or &quot;db/decade&quot;, for short.

== At Zero Radial Frequency == 

At zero radial frequency, the value of the bode plot is simply the DC gain value ''in decibels''. Remember, bode plots have a log-10 magnitude Y-axis, so we need to convert our gain to decibels:

:&lt;math&gt;Magnitude = 20\log_{10}(DC Gain)&lt;/math&gt;

== At a Break Point == 

We can notice that each given term changes it's effect as the radial frequency goes from below the break point, to above the break point.  Let's show an example:

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + \frac{j\omega}{5})&lt;/math&gt;

Our breakpoint occurs at 5 radians per second. When our radial frequency is ''much less'' than the break point, we have the following:

:&lt;math&gt;Gain = (1 + 0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Magnitude = 20\log_{10}(1) = 0db/decade&lt;/math&gt;

When our radial frequency is equal to our break point we have the following:

:&lt;math&gt;Gain = |(1 + j)| = \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Magnitude = 20\log_{10}(\sqrt{2}) = 3db/decade&lt;/math&gt;

And when our radial frequency is much higher (10 times) our break point we get:

:&lt;math&gt;Gain = |(1 + 10 j)| \approx 10&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Magnitude = 20\log_{10}(10) = 20db/decade&lt;/math&gt;

However, we need to remember that some of our terms are &quot;Poles&quot; and some of them are &quot;Zeros&quot;.

=== Zeros ===

Zeros have a positive effect on the magnitude plot. The contributions of a zero are all positive:

;Radial Frequency &lt;&lt; Break Point : 0db/decade gain.
;Radial Frequency = Break Point : 3db/decade gain.
;Radial Frequency &gt;&gt; Break Point : 20db/decade gain.

=== Poles ===

Poles have a negative effect on the magnitude plot. The contributions of the poles are as follows:

;Radial Frequency &lt;&lt; Break Point : 0db/decade gain.
;Radial Frequency = Break Point : -3db/decade gain.
;Radial Frequency &gt;&gt; Break Point : -20db/decade gain.

== Conclusions ==

To draw a bode plot effectively, follow these simple steps:

#Put the frequency response equation into bode equation form.
#identify the DC gain value, and mark this as a horizontal line coming in from the far left (where the radial frequency conceptually is zero).
#At every &quot;zero&quot; break point, increase the slope of the line upwards by 20db/decade.
#At every &quot;pole&quot; break point, decrease the slope of the line downwards by 20db/decade.
#at every breakpoint, note that the &quot;actual value&quot; is 3db off from the value graphed.

And then you are done!

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Purpose:
Having a good stance is one of the most important skills to have in wrestling.  As you will learn, a good stance is vital to your success.  Throughout the book, we will be referring back to your stance and movement, so make sure that you master it now. A good stance will allow you to both defend against an opponents attack and initiate your own offensive moves. The finer points of the stance will be decided by your wrestling style (which you should already be formulating, based on the information in the last chapter) but the basic stance remains the same.  Your knee's should be bent (to varying degrees based on style), your head should be up (more on this in the next chapter), and your weight should be distributed evenly throughout your foot (more on this in the next chapter as well).  You may think that your stance is supposed to be comfortable... It's not.  In order for you to get the maximum amount of both offense and defense, you are going to have to stand in an uncomfortable position.  Figuring out your ultimate wrestling strategy will be discussed near the end of the book, but for now it is best to master all the different stances, so as to keep your options open.  The different choices that you have during your stance include:


# '''Staggered Stance''' Or '''Square Stance'''
# '''Straight Back''' or '''Curled Back'''
# '''Forward Lean''' or '''Regular Lean'''
# '''High Stance''' or '''Low Stance'''
# '''Fingers Forward''' or '''Palms Forward'''


Let's go through all of these options in detail:

# '''Staggered''' or '''Square''' Stance
*Movement
**Don't Cross Feet
**Lead Leg Movement in Staggered Stance
**Forward Lean Versus Regular, Movement Changes

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here are some of the Ant best practices that have been identified for creating maintainable Ant build files.  Best Practices are not enforced by any compiler but they are conventions that allow people that are maintaining many projects to become quickly familiar with your build process.

==Learn Ant Best Practices==
Building your Ant Vocabulary
* Study ant build scripts for other Open Source projects
* Learn domain-specific targets such as building jar files, doing XML transforms or complex installs
* Depending on diversity of tasks this might take a few hours to a few weeks

      <text xml:space="preserve">* [[/Mere Christianity/]] by C.S. Lewis
: '''C'''(live) '''S'''(taples) '''Lewis''' (1898-1963) &amp;#8722; British author, literary scholar, and Christian apologist. He wrote more than 40 books, the best-known being, [[../Famous works of fiction/The Screwtape Letters|The Screwtape Letters]] (1942). This satire is a masterpiece of diabolical wit and moral wisdom involving a correspondence between two devils, Screwtape, one of the upper echelon in Satan's &quot;Lowerachy,&quot; and his nephew, &quot;Dear Wormwood,&quot; a junior devil with an earthly mission, wherein the human &quot;patient&quot; is under close scrutiny. The Allegory of Love (1936), his major critical work, is a study of love in medieval literature. [[/Mere Christianity/]], an expanded series of 1943 BBC radio chats, is most admired and influential across a wide spectrum of Christians, which may attest to the author's success in accomplishing the aim of restating theology in a way that avoids many controversies. He also wrote a well-known science-fiction trilogy and the [[/Chronicles of Narnia/]] fantasies for children.

==Description==


== Growing Conditions ==
Reducing the ground until completely free from root-weeds helps in potato husbandry; though in many seasons one cannot complete these operations without losing the proper time for planting, which never ought to come after the first of May, if circumstances do not absolutely prevent it.

Cutting the seed into small slips does not provide any advantage, for the strength of the stem at the outset depends in direct proportion upon the vigor and power of the seed-plant. Accordingly, make the seed plant large, rarely smaller than the fourth-part of the potato; and in the case of small seed-potatoes one may profitably use half of the potato. At all events, rather err in using over-large seed than in making it too small; because, by the first error, no great loss can ever be sustained; whereas, by the other, a feeble and late crop may result. With properly cut seed, it requires from ten to twelve hundredweight of potatoes to plant an acre (1.2 to 1.5 t/ha) of ground, where the rows lie twenty-seven inches (700 mm) apart; but this quantity depends greatly upon the size of the potatoes used; large potatoes may require a greater weight, but the extra quantity will abundantly pay off in the superiority of the crop which large seed usually produces.

Cultivation should go twelve inches deep, if the soil will allow it; after this, the gardener should open a hole (about six inches (150 mm) deep and not more than twelve inches (300 mm) in diameter).

 There are two common alternate methods of growing potatoes by the amateur gardener. The first is container growing. One seed potato should be placed 15cm (6in) deep in a container which is 30cm (1ft) or more in diameter. Normal potting compost can be used. The amount of potatoes will obviously be small, but it's fun for the small garden.

The second method is to cover the planting area for early varieties  with black polythene, simply held down with earth or bricks.  The potatoes are planted at normal depth by cutting a '+' shaped hole in the plastic and planting with a trowel. The advantages are that the soil is warmed by the black polythene, giving the young plants protection from frost. The potatoes should be ready for harvest a couple of weeks earlier than normal.

==Varieties==


==Uses==


==Maintenance==


==Propagation==


==Harvest==
Potatoes are ready for harvest when the foliage first starts to die and turn yellow. Early (new) potatoes can be lifted earlier (no earlier than June) to get the very tastiest potatoes. In this case, harvest them about a week after the potato plant flowers first appear. New potatoes only produce a couple of handfuls of potatoes per plant, so dig up the whole plant.

Maincrop potatoes will be ready for harvest in mid-Autumn (start of September at the earliest). For all potatoes, dig them up from the side of the ridge (a fork or spade are both fine) to avoid damaging the potatoes. The foliage can be placed on the compost heap only if it completely free from disease - if not, burn it. If you don't need all the potatoes from a plant at one time or if you want a few early in the season, simply burrow around the roots with your hands and remove the potatoes you need. The remaining potatoes will continue to grow.

Remove any soil clinging to the potatoes and leave them on the soil for a few hours to dry out - if they are stored damp, they will rot. Leaving them on the soil surface in the sun will harden the skin slightly, doubling the storage time - this is especially important for maincrop potatoes. Store the potatoes in boxes or sacks, checking them every few days, removing all but those in good condition. Damaged or blemished potatoes should be eaten immediately.

One word of caution, some potato flowers may well turn to berries which are definitely poisonous. Eaten in sufficient amounts the berries can be fatal. You may wish to remove them if children are likely to see them.

Store up potatoes for winter and spring use; and as one should keep them as long through summer as possible, make every endeavor to preserve them from frost, and from sprouting in the spring months. For frost protection, cover them well with straw when lodged in a house, and by a thick coat of earth when deposited in a pit; to prevent sprouting, pick them carefully at different times, when they begin to sprout, and dry them sufficiently by exposure to the sun, or by a gentle toast of a kiln.

==Pests and Diseases ==
Potatoes grown from stock certified as free from disease and planted in soil not occupied by potatoes the previous season, are relatively free from pests and diseases. The most common ailments to affect potatoes are potato blight (see next paragraph), scab, slugs, and wireworm. There is little protection available that can effectively solve these problems.

Potato blight has two phases - the first attacks the leaves, the second attacks the potatoes themselves. If your potatoes are attacked by the blight, there is no cure. However, cut the foliage back to 5cm (2in) from the ground at the first signs of infection. This will prevent the blight from getting to the potatoes themselves. With no foliage, the potatoes will not give of their best, but they will continue to grow for a month or so.

= Addition =

Addition is based on counting.  For example, Pat and Chris each have a few rocks in their collections.  Pat counts her rocks and finds that she has 3 rocks.  Chris counts his collection and he has 5 rocks.  When they combine their collections and count them all, the total they get is 8 rocks.  3 rocks plus 5 rocks equals 8 rocks.

The total is also call the sum.  When counting the total, it obviously does not matter whether Pat counts hers first or Chris counts his first.  5 + 3 = 8 as well as 3 + 5 = 8.  This concept works for any addition situation.

*'''When adding, it does not matter which number is first.'''

== One-digit numbers ==

Knowing the basic addition facts for all the one-digit numbers is crucial for doing arithmetic efficiently.  Adding  any number to zero always gives the original number.  No matter how many rocks Pat has, if Chris has none, together they have a sum thatis the same as Pat's amount.

The addition of digits other than zero must be memorized.  Use the table below to review these facts.  Find one number to be added, in the left column; find the other in the top row.  The sum is where the column and row meet.

{|align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;

|- align=&quot;center&quot;

|}

== Multi-digit numbers ==

Pat went on a day trip.  In the morning she traveled for 3 hours.  In the afternoon she traveled 8 miles.  How long was her trip altogether?

This question cannot be answered (unless there is more information available, such as an average travel speed.)

* '''Only the same kind of things can be added.'''

This concept is used in adding multi-digit numbers.  (It is also used in adding fractions, and letters in algebra.)

When adding multi-digit numbers, the digits must be aligned so that the digits in the same place values are one under another.

Example:  14 + 36

{|
|
 {| 
 | 
 | align=&quot;right&quot; | 14 
 |- 
 | + 
 | align=&quot;right&quot; | 36
 |-
 | colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black;&quot; | =
 |}
|
 {|
 | The ones digits are aligned. &lt;br&gt; And the tens digits are aligned. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 |}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basic Operations==

This chapter gives some theoretical basics about structure of Lisp
programs. 

===Syntax===

Lisp operates on forms. Each Lisp form is either an atom or a list of
forms. Atoms are numbers, strings, symbols and some other structures.
Lisp symbols are actually quite interesting - I'll talk about them in
another section.

When Lisp is forced to evaluate the form it looks whether it's an atom
or a list. If it's an atom then its value is returned (numbers,
strings and other data return themselves, symbols return their value).
If the form is a list, Lisp looks at the first element of the list, which is called
its '''car''' (an archaic term which stands for '''C'''ontents of the '''A'''ddress part of '''R'''egister). The car of a list should be a symbol or
a lambda-expression (lambda-expressions would be discussed later). If
it's a symbol Lisp takes its function (the function associated to
that symbol - NOT its value) and executes that function with the
arguments taken from the rest of the list (if it contains forms
they're evaluated as well).

Example:
(+ 1 2 3) returns 6. Symbol &quot;+&quot; is associated with the function '''+''' that
performs the addition of its arguments.
(+ 1 (+ 2 3) 4) returns 10. The second argument contains a form and is
evaluated before being passed to the outer '''+'''.

===Some interesting functions===

'''+''', '''-''', '''*''', '''/''' are basic operations on numbers. They can accept
multiple arguments. Note that (/ 1 2) is 1/2, not 0.5 - Lisp knows
rational numbers (as well as complex ones...). '''&lt;''', '''&lt;=''', '''=''' and so on
are used for number comparison. Note that '''=''', '''&lt;''', '''&lt;=''' and others are '''''[[wikt:en:polyadic#English|polyadic]]''''':

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (= 1 1 1) ⇒ t
 (= 1 1 2) ⇒ nil
 (&lt; 1 2 3) ⇒ t
 (&lt; 1 3 2) ⇒ nil
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''list''' as the name suggests creates a list.
 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (list 1 2 3) ⇒ (1 2 3)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''cons''' creates a pair (a pair has 2 elements and is '''not''' a list).

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (cons 1 2) ⇒ (1 . 2) ;;note the dot. 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''car''' or '''first''' returns the first element of the cons (pair). '''cdr'''
or '''rest''' returns the second element of the cons.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (car (cons 1 2)) ⇒ 1  (cdr (cons 1 2)) ⇒ 2
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Lists and conses===

Since lists are so prominent in Lisp it's good to know what they exactly are. The truth is that, with one exception, lists consist of conses. This exception is a special list called '''nil''' - also known as '''()'''. '''nil''' is a ''self-evaluating'' symbol that is used both as a falsehood constant and an empty list. '''nil''' is the only false value in Lisp - everything else is true for the purpose of '''if''' and similar constructs. The opposite of '''nil''' is '''t''', which is also self-evaluating and represents the truth. '''t''' is, however, not a list. Let's return to the lists, then... A ''proper list'' (improper lists will not be explained here) is defined as any list that is either '''nil''' or a '''cons''' whose '''cdr''' is a proper list. (Note that since proper lists have to start from somewhere, &lt;code&gt;(cdr (cdr (cdr... (cdr x)))...)&lt;/code&gt; is '''nil''' for some finite number of '''cdr'''s.)

Basically, a proper list is a sequence of conses, such that the next cons is a cdr of a previous cons. It's easy to understand how lists are constructed if you consider a graphical representation. A cons can be represented as a rectangle divided into two squares. Each of squares can hold a value. In a proper list left square holds the element of the list, and the right square holds the next cons (or '''nil''' if it is the end of the list). Note that each cons holds exactly one element of the list. That's how (1 2 3) would look in graphical representation:

 .-------.
 | * | * |
 '-|---|-'
   V   V
   1 .-------.
     | * | * |
     '-|---|-'
       V   V
       2 .-------.
         | * | * |
         '-|---|-'
           V   V
           3  nil

So (1 2 3) is really (1 . (2 . (3 . nil))). What follows from that is that (car (list 1 2 3)) is 1 and (cdr (list 1 2 3)) is (2 3). What doesn't follow from all of the above is that (car nil) and (cdr nil) are '''nil'''. This is not very consistent, because (cons nil nil) is not the same thing as nil, but it happens to be convenient.

===Symbols===

Symbols play the same role as variable names in other programming
languages. Basically a symbol is a string associated with some values.
The string can consist of any characters, including spaces and control
characters. However, most symbol names do not use characters other than letters, numbers, and hyphens,
because they're awkward to type. In addition, the characters &quot;(&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, &quot;#&quot;, &quot;\&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;|&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, whitespace, and the double and single quote marks are likely to be misunderstood by the lisp reader; and other characters such as &quot;*&quot; are conventionally used only for certain purposes.  By default Lisp converts what you type to uppercase.

Symbols are created as you use them. For example, when you type (setf x
1) symbol called &quot;X&quot; is created (remember that Lisp uppercases your
input) and its value is set to 1. However it is good style to define
your symbols before you use them. '''defvar''' and '''defparameter''' are used
for that purpose.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter x 1) ;;defines symbol &quot;X&quot; and sets its value to 1.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A symbol can also have other parameters associated with it besides its name and value - functions, classes
and so on. To get a function associated with a symbol, a special
operator (these are discussed in the next chapter) '''function''' is used.

===Macros and special operators===

There are operators in Lisp that look like functions, but behave
slightly differently. These are macros and special operators. Functions always evaluate their arguments, but occasionally this is undesirable, so these forms must be implemented.

For example, consider the ubiquitous '''if''' construct. '''If''' takes the form (if ''condition'' ''then'' ''else''); ''condition'' is first evaluated, followed by ''then'' if ''condition'' is not '''nil''' or ''else'' if it is '''nil'''.  Thus, (if t 1 2) returns 1 and (if nil 1 2) returns 2.  Obviously, '''if''' cannot be implemented as a function because only one of its two final arguments will be evaluated. Thus, it is created as one of about 25 special operators, which are all predefined in the Lisp implementation.

Another special operator is '''quote'''. It returns its only argument,
''unevaluated''. Again, this is impossible with functions, as they always
evaluate their arguments. Quote is used quite often, so it can be expressed by the single character ' . Thus, (quote x) is equivalent to 'x. '''quote''' may be used to
quickly create lists: '(1 2 3) returns (1 2 3), '(x y z) returns
(x y z) - compare that to (list x y z) which would create a list of
''values'' of x, y and z, or signal an error if no values were assigned.
In fact, '(x y z) is the same value as (list 'x 'y 'z).

Macros are like special operators, but they're not hardcoded in a Lisp
implementation. Instead, they can be defined in Lisp code. A lot of Lisp constructs
you will be using are actually macros. Only very essential constructs are
hardcoded. Of course, to the user there is no difference.

==Simple programming==

In this chapter I'll explain how to do simple things in Lisp. Many useful constructs will be introduced. After reading this chapter, you should be able to write simple programs.

===Storing values===

While storing values in variables is an important process in many
programming languages, in Lisp it is used much less often. Although it is multi-paradigm, Lisp is often referred to and programmed in as a functional language.  Functional languages do not allow (or at least discourage) the use of state, or stored information that implicitly changes the behavior of a function.  In theory, assignments are never needed in a purely functional program. As you may
have noticed, I never stored values anywhere in the previous chapter,
except in the &quot;Symbols&quot; section. This shows that the storing of global values is rarely needed.

That being said, it is still useful to store values, and Lisp ''does'' provide for this. The macros '''setf''' and '''setq''' store values into symbols:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setq x 1) =&gt; 1
 x =&gt; 1
 (setq x 1 y 2 z 3) =&gt; 3
 (list x y z) =&gt; (1 2 3)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''Setf''' is much more powerful than '''setq''', as it allows the programmer to change a single part of a variable:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setq abc '(1 2 3)) =&gt; (1 2 3)
 (setq (car abc) 3) =&gt; error!
 (setf (car abc) 3) =&gt; 3
 abc =&gt; (3 2 3)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
For this reason, '''setf''' is used more often than '''setq'''.

In other languages, assignments are usually denoted as something like '''x=1'''. The '''=''' here means something different than the mathematical '''=''' sign.  Lisp reserves '''=''' for the mathematical definition, i.e. testing for numerical equality.  It may appear that &lt;tt&gt;(setf place value)&lt;/tt&gt; is more complicated than needed, but it is useful to remember that this facility is extensible and allows the user to remove the internal representation of data from the assignment.  This is similar to reassigning the '''=''' operator in other languages (something not possible in C and some other languages).

'''Setf''' is a useful utility, despite the extra keystrokes it requires.  In practice, though, you'll be using assignment less often than in other languages, because there is another way in Lisp to remember values: by binding them.

''Note: '''setq''' stands for '''set q'''uote. Originally, a '''set''' function existed that would evaluate its first argument. Programmers got tired of quoting the argument, and defined this special operator. '''Set''' is now deprecated.''

===Binding values===

When values are ''bound'' to symbols, they are temporarily stored and then unbound, the values forgotten. With '''let''' and '''let*''' you can bind some values to some variables
within some part of your program. The difference between '''let''' and '''let*''' is
that '''let''' initialises its variables in parallel and '''let*''' does it
sequentially. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (let ((x 1) (y 2) (z 3)) (+ x y z)) =&gt; 6
 (let* ((x 1) (y (+ x 1)) (z (+ y 1))) (+ x y z)) =&gt; 6
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Inside the body of '''let''' you can use variables you defined as though
they're real symbols - outside of '''let''' these symbols can be unbound or
have completely different values. If you call or define functions
within the '''let''' body, the bindings stick around, making some interesting
interactions possible (these are outside of the scope of this
manual). You can even use '''setf''' on these variables and the new value
would be stored temporarily. As soon as the last form in '''let''' body is
executed its result is returned, and the variables are restored back
to their original values. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setf x 3 y 4 z 5) =&gt; 5
 (let ((x 1) (y 2) (z 3)) (+ x y z)) =&gt; 6
 (+ x y z) =&gt; 12
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Good programming practices generally recommend using local variables whenever possible, and limiting global variables only to when it is absolutely necessary.  Thus, you should use '''let''' whenever possible, and treat '''setf''' like there is a tax on each use.

===Control flow===

The '''if''' operator was already explained before, but may seem hard to use at this point. This is because '''if''' allows only one form for each branch, which makes it hard to use in most situations.
Fortunately, Lisp syntax
gives you more freedom to define your blocks than C's curly braces or Pascal's '''begin'''/'''end'''. '''progn''' creates a very simple block of code, executing its arguments one by one and returning
the result of the last one. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (progn (setf x 1 y 2) (setf z (+ x y)) (* y z)) =&gt; 6
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''let''' and '''let*''' can also be used for this
purpose, especially if you want some temporary variables inside the
branches. 

'''block''' creates a named block, from which you can return
with '''return-from''':

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (block aaa
   (return-from aaa 1) 
   (+ 1 2 3)) =&gt; 1 ;;The form (+ 1 2 3) is not evaluated.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

...and other forms exist, such as '''the''', '''locally''', '''prog1''', '''tagbody''' and so on.
Fortunately, if you're not into writing Lisp macros, '''if''' is probably
the only construct where you'll have to use blocks.

As '''if''' is quite ugly when used repeatedly, there are some convenient macros in place so you
won't have to use it all that often. '''when''' evaluates its first argument
and, if it's not '''nil''', evaluates the rest of its arguments, returning
the last result. '''unless''' does the same if its first argument is
'''nil'''. Otherwise they both return '''nil'''.

'''cond''' is slightly more complicated, but also more useful. It tests its conditions until one
of them is not nil and then evaluates the associated code. This is easier to parse and better-looking than nested '''if''''s. The syntax of '''cond''' is as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (cond (condition1 some-forms1)
       (condition2 some-forms2)
       ...and so on...)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''case''' is similar to '''cond''' except it branches after examining the value
of some expression:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (case expression
   (values1 some-forms1) ;values is either one value 
   (values2 some-forms2) ;or a list of values.
   ...
   (t some-forms-t)) ;executed if no values match
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
				
'''or''' evaluates its arguments until one of them is not nil, returning
its value, or the value of last argument.

'''and''' evaluates its arguments until one of them is nil, returning its
value (nil, that is) - otherwise the value of the last argument is
returned.

You may notice that '''or''' and '''and''' could be used as logical operations
as well - remember that everything non-nil is true.

===Loops===

Iteration, or evaluating a form many times, is covered by many tools
evaluating something many times. The most useful tool is '''loop''' - in
its simplest form it simply executes its body until the '''return'''
operator is called, in which case it returns the specified value:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setf x 0)
 (loop (setf x (+ x 1)) (when (&gt; x 10) (return x))) =&gt; 11
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

More complicated forms of '''loop''' are better learned through examples. Depending on the type of iteration wanted, different operators, such as '''for''' and '''until''', are used.  While '''loop'''
should be enough for all kind of loops, there are other constructs for
those who wouldn't like to learn its full syntax.

'''dotimes''' executes some code a fixed number of times. Its syntax is:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (dotimes (var number result) 
   forms)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''dotimes''' increments ''var'' from 0 to ''number'' and executes ''forms'' each time with that value of ''var'', returning ''result'' in the end.

'''dolist''' iterates through a list: its syntax is the same as of '''dotimes''' except that a list replaces ''number''.  ''var'' begins as the list's '''car''' and is moved until it reaches the list's last element.

'''mapcar''' applies a function to different sets of arguments and returns
a list of results, for example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (mapcar #'+ '(1 3 6) '(2 4 7) '(3 5 8)) =&gt; (6 12 21)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;'+ is a shortcut for (function +). The function + is first applied to
the list of arguments (1 2 3), then to (3 4 5) and then to (6 7 8).

===Defining functions===

Functions are defined using macro '''defun''':

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defun function-name (arguments)
   (body))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The created function is associated with the symbol ''function-name'' and
can be called like any other function. It's worth mentioning that
functions defined that way can be recursive or can call each other - this is an essential part of most Lisp programming. An example of a recursive function is:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defun factorial (x)
   (if (= x 0) 1
     (* x (factorial (- x 1)))))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

As can be seen, this function simply describes an otherwise complicated operation by calling itself over and over. The process is stopped when x = 0, and x decreases with each call, eliminating (for positive integer x) the possibility of an infinite loop.  Note that x, being an argument, takes on a different value for each call of the function.  As seen in &quot;Binding values&quot; above, none of these values override any of the previous.

The special operator '''lambda''' creates an anonymous function, which you can
use for a one-time purpose. Its syntax is the same except instead of
&quot;defun function-name&quot; you write &quot;lambda&quot;. These functions cannot be
recursive. For the most part, lambda functions are used in forms such as '''mapcar''' (and '''funcall''' and '''apply''' below) to eliminate excessive repetition or memory use.

You can also bind functions temporarily with '''flet''' and '''labels'''. They
are very similar to '''let''' and '''let*'''. The difference between them is
that in '''labels''' a function can refer to itself, while in '''flet''' it
refers to a former function with the same name instead.

===Calling functions===

To call a function f with arguments a1, a2, and a3, simply type

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (f a1 a2 a3)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Sometimes the function which should be called is stored in a variable
and you don't know its name beforehand. Or maybe you don't know how
many arguments are to be passed. In those cases the functions '''funcall''' and
'''apply''' become handy. Like all functions they evaluate their arguments
- the first one should produce a function to be called, the rest
should produce arguments. '''Funcall''' just calls the function with
whatever arguments supplied. '''Apply''' checks if its last argument is
a list and if it is, it treats it as a list of arguments. Compare:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (funcall #'list '(1 2) '(3 4))  =&gt; ((1 2) (3 4))
 (apply #'list '(1 2) '(3 4)) =&gt; ((1 2) 3 4)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===User interaction===

For this tutorial I've cover only the simple tasks of input and output. To read a value from the user use the '''read''' function. It will attempt to read an arbitrary Lisp expression from the input, and the value returned by read is that expression.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 &gt;(read)  ;Run read function
 (+ 1 x)  ;That's what the user types
 (+ 1 X)  ;that's what is returned
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In that example the returned value is a list of three elements: symbol +, number 1 and symbol X (note how it got uppercased). '''read''' is one of the three functions that comprise ''read-eval-print'' loop, the core element of Lisp. This is the same function that is used to read the expressions you type at the Lisp prompt. 

While '''read''' is handy for receiving numbers and lists from the user, other data-types are expected by most users to be fed to computer in a different manner. Take strings for example. To make '''read''' recognise a string one must add double quotes around it &lt;code&gt;&quot;like this&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. But a normal user expects to just type &lt;code&gt;like this&lt;/code&gt; without the quotes and press Enter. So, there is a different general-purpose function used for input: '''read-line'''. '''read-line''' returns a string that contains what user typed before pressing Enter. You can then process that string to extract the information you need.

For output there is also quite a number of functions available. One that is interesting to us is '''princ''', which simply prints a supplied value, and also returns it. This may be confusing when using it in the Lisp console:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 &gt;(princ &quot;aaa&quot;)
 aaa
 &quot;aaa&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The first aaa (without the quotes) is what is printed, while the second one is a returned value (which is printed by the '''print''' function and it is not as nice-looking). Another function that could be useful is '''terpri''', which prints a new line to the output (the name &quot;terpri&quot; is historical and means &quot;TERminate PRInt line&quot;).

== Phasor Arithmetic ==

This page will review phasors and phasor arithmetic topics.

== Forms == 

Phasors have two components, the magnitude (M) and the phase angle (&amp;phi;). Phasors are related to sinusoids through our cosine convention:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = |M| \angle \phi = |M| \cos (t\omega + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Remember, there are '''3 forms to phasors''':
==== Polar Form ====
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = |M| \angle \phi&lt;/math&gt; 
==== Rectangular Form ====
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = A + jB&lt;/math&gt;
==== Exponential Form ====
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = |M|e^{j\phi}&lt;/math&gt; 

Phasor and Exponential forms are identical and are also referred to as polar form.

== Converting between Forms ==

When working with phasors it is often necessary to convert between rectangular and polar form. To convert from rectangular form to polar form:

:&lt;math&gt;|M| = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \arctan \left( \frac{B}{A} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

To convert from polar to rectangular form:

A is the part of the phasor along the real axis

:&lt;math&gt;A = |M|\cos \left( \phi \right)&lt;/math&gt;

B is the part of the phasor along the imaginary axis

:&lt;math&gt;B = |M|\sin \left( \phi \right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Addition ==

To add two phasors together, we must convert them into rectangular form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 = A_1 + jB_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_2 = A_2 + jB_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 + \mathbb{C}_2 = (A_1 + A_2) + j(B_1 + B_2)&lt;/math&gt;

This is a well-known property of complex arithmetic.

== Subtraction ==

Subtraction is similar to addition, except now we subtract

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 = A_1 + jB_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_2 = A_2 + jB_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 - \mathbb{C}_2 = (A_1 - A_2) + j(B_1 - B_2)&lt;/math&gt;

== Multiplication ==

To multiply two phasors, we should first convert them to polar form to make things simpler. The product in polar form is simply the product of their magnitudes, and the phase is the sum of their phases.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 = M_1 \angle \phi_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_2 = M_2 \angle \phi_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 \times \mathbb{C}_2 = M_1 \times M_2 \angle {\phi_1+\phi_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Keep in mind that in polar form, phasors are exponential quantities with a magnitude (M), and an argument (&amp;phi;). Multiplying two exponentials together forces us to multiply the magnitudes, and add the exponents.

== Division ==

Division is similar to multiplication, except now we divide the magnitudes, and subtract the phases

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 = |M_1| \angle \phi_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_2 = |M_2| \angle \phi_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{|\mathbb{C}_1 \over \mathbb{C}_2|} = {|M_1 \over M_2|} \angle {\phi_1-\phi_2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Inversion ==

An important relationship that is worth understanding is the '''inversion property''' of phasors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M_C\angle 0 = -M_C \angle \pi&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in degrees,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M_C\angle 0^\circ = -M_C \angle 180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

On the normal cartesian plane, for instance, the negative X axis is 180 degrees around from the positive X axis. By using that fact on an imaginary axis, we can see that the Negative Real axis is facing in the exact opposite direction from the Positive Real axis, and therefore is 180 degrees apart.

== Complex Conjugation ==

Similar to the inversion property is the '''complex conjugation property''' of phasors. Complex conjugation is denoted with an asterisk above the phasor to be conjugated. Since phasors can be graphed on the Real-Imaginary plane, a 90 degree phasor is a purely imaginary number, and a -90 degree phasor is its complex conjugate:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M \angle 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^* = M \angle -90^\circ = M \angle 270^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

Essentially, this holds true for phasors with all angles: the sign of the angle is reversed to produce the complex conjugate of the phasor in polar notation. In general, for polar notation, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M \angle \phi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^* = M \angle -\phi&lt;/math&gt;

In rectangular form, we can express complex conjugation as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = A + jB&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^* = A - jB&lt;/math&gt;

Notice the only difference in the complex conjugate of C is the sign change of the imaginary part.</text>

== Introduction ==

=== Purpose of this book ===

This book has the purpose to illustrate:

* What the basics of the game are.
* How a beginner can learn the basics of the game.
* How a coach can teach the basics of the game to a team of beginners.

=== Intended audience ===
the intended audience for this is for people of all ages

== Fundamentals ==

&quot;What?!&quot;, I hear you cry, &quot;people actually call this a sport?&quot; Well, yes.
Now, the rules basic rules of Ultimate Frisbee, as we like to call it, are remarkable simple. It is only when you delve a little deeper that things start to get complicated. But all things in good time, and here is the general gist of the game for a total ultimate virgin;

There are two teams on the pitch at any one time, playing in opposite directions, with one disc.
7 players on each team on the pitch at any one time outdoors, 5 indoors.
You cannot travel bipedally or any other way when holding the disc.
The disc may be thrown in any direction.
If the disc is dropped/not caught/intercepted/stalled out (see below) then possession of the disc goes to the other team.
At either end of the pitch there are the End Zones.
To score one point you must be in the oppositions' End Zone and catch the disc.
When each point is scored then the teams swap directions.
The disc cannot be held for more than 10 seconds at a time outside, 8 inside.
If the indicated number of seconds is reached without release of the disc, then that is a Stall Out, possession changes.
All games are self ajudicated, no referees. Disputes must be solved between the players involved.
If a dispute is not resolved, then that play is reset.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sanskrit is one of the oldest known languages. It is also regarded as a highly scientific language. It is known for its conciseness, and complications. 

Many great literary texts, dating milleniums back, have been preserved as it is, in Sanskrit. The reason for this is that the language has maintained its grammar and vocabulary. There have been new words that have been added over time, but the language retains the form - precise and concise. These texts have been passed on word-for-word through the centuries. 

A strong formative influence on the Sanskrit language was the grammar of Panini, which regularized and simplified the grammar. The grammatical and linguistic uniformity of some Sanskrit texts comes from editing done after the texts were completed, to bring them into line with Panini's rules. The epics, in particular, bear traces of such editing.

The Vedas are one such great texts and are worshipped and widely read. 

Various Upanishads, Puranas and Shastras, were all written in Sanskrit and have been completely intact over time. 

Srimad Bhagawad Gita, 
Sri Vishnu Purana,
Sri Bhagawad Purana and so on..

Apart from these, many ancient texts were written in Sanskrit and are available today.

In addition to religious and philosophical texts, the tradition of Kavya court poetry flourished from maybe the sixth to the ninth century. Kavi is hot-house poetry-- it prizes exotic imagery, recherche allusions, and, above all, word play. 

Related to the Kavya tradition is the great poet Kalidasa, who is known above all as a poet and dramatist. His poetry shares many characteristics with Kavi, and his plays have a certain similarity of sensibility with Kavya poetry. The Abhijnaanasakuntalam retells a story from the Mahabharata, where the king Dushyanta falls in love with Sakuntala, forgets his love for her by coming in contact with a cursed ring, has a series of adventures and after a long period of time is reunited and re-enamored of Sakuntala.

Need to add more words and sentences here. Sentences taken from scriptures and translated here would help in ability to read and understand sanskrit. The target audience of this textbook is probably some one who doesn't know much Sanskrit. Any examples would be helpful here, more than any thing else.  [[User:Chaturganj|Pankaj]]</text>

{{wikipedia|Surface_of_revolution}}

Suppose we are given a function ''f'' and we want to calculate the surface area of the function ''f'' rotated around a given line.  The calculation of surface area of revolution is related to the arc length calculation.

If the function ''f'' is a straight line, other methods such as surface area formulas for cylinders and conical frustra can be used.  However, if ''f'' is not linear, an integration technique must be used.

Recall the formula for the lateral surface area of a conical frustum:

:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi r l \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the average radius and ''l'' is the slant height of the frustum.

For ''y=f(x)'' and &lt;math&gt;a\le x\le b&lt;/math&gt;, we divide ''[a,b]'' into subintervals with equal width Δx and endpoints &lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;.  We map each point &lt;math&gt;y_i= f(x_i) \,&lt;/math&gt; to a conical frustum of width Δx and lateral surface area &lt;math&gt;A_i \,&lt;/math&gt;.

We can estimate the surface area of revolution with the sum

:&lt;math&gt; A = \sum_{i=0}^{n} A_i &lt;/math&gt;

As we divide ''[a,b]'' into smaller and smaller pieces, the estimate gives a better value for the surface area.

==Definition (Surface of Revolution)==

The surface area of revolution of the curve ''y=f(x)'' about a line for &lt;math&gt;a\le x\le b&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be

&lt;math&gt; A = \lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n} A_i&lt;/math&gt;

==The Surface Area Formula==

Suppose ''f'' is a continuous function on the interval ''[a,b]'' and ''r(x)'' represents the distance from ''f(x)'' to the axis of rotation.  Then the lateral surface area of revolution about a line is given by

:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi \int_a^b r(x) \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(x))^2 } dx&lt;/math&gt;

And in Leibniz notation
:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi \int_a^b r(x) \sqrt{ 1+ \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2 } dx&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:'''

:{|
|&lt;math&gt; A \ &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n A_i &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n 2 \pi r_i l_i &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 2 \pi \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n r_i l_i &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|}

As &lt;math&gt; n \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Delta x \rightarrow 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we know two things:

1. the average radius of each conical frustum &lt;math&gt; r_i &lt;/math&gt; approaches a single value

2. the slant height of each conical frustum &lt;math&gt; l_i &lt;/math&gt; equals an infitesmal segment of arc length

From the arc length formula discussed in the previous section, we know that

:&lt;math&gt; l_i = \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(x_i))^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore
:{|
|&lt;math&gt; A \ &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 2 \pi \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n r_i l_i &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 2 \pi \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n r_i \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(x_i))^2} \Delta x &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|}

Because of the definition of an integral &lt;math&gt; \int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(c_i) \Delta x_i &lt;/math&gt;, we can simplify the sigma operation to an integral.

:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi \int_a^b r(x) \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(x))^2 } dx&lt;/math&gt;

Or if ''f'' is in terms of ''y'' on the interval ''[c,d]''

:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi \int_c^d r(y) \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(y))^2} dy &lt;/math&gt;

...each floor up gets &lt;strike&gt;progressively&lt;/strike&gt; smaller until you reach the top room...


 I am 13 and I think that instead of using the word ''progressively'' You should say that ''...each floor up gets smaller and smaller...'' 



&lt;strike&gt;Wedge shaped symbols&lt;/strike&gt; were &lt;strike&gt;inscribed&lt;/strike&gt; on clay tablets with a &lt;strike&gt;reed stylus&lt;/strike&gt;...Many neighboring countries later adopted this writing method to record their own language (Eblaites, Hittites, Hurrites, Elamites)

What are ''wedge shaped symbols'' or ''reed stylus''? I sugest giving an example.

''were inscribed on clay tablets'' how about saying were ''carved into'' clay tablets.



...it was overcome by neighboring &lt;strike&gt;city-states&lt;/strike&gt;...

You might want to explain what a ''city-state'' is.

:[[User:Bdavis|Bdavis]]

i think it's not fair to say jews and arabs , no offense to jews but i think arabs represent many semitic groups and jews are not as many as them also not to forget arabs are modern compared to their ancient ancestors.and logically AND is considered commutative so no big deal.

== Quantity vs Numbers ==

An important distinction must be made between &quot;Quantities&quot; and &quot;Numbers&quot;. A quantity is simply some amount of &quot;stuff&quot;; five apples, three pounds, and one automobile are all quantities of different things. A quantity can be represented by any number of different representations. For example, tick-marks on a piece of paper, beads on a string, or stones in a pocket can all represent some quantity of something. One of the most familiar representations are the base-10 (or &quot;decimal&quot;) numbers, which consist of 10 digits, from 0 to 9. When more than 9 objects needs to be counted, we make a new column with a 1 in it (which represents a group of 10), and we continue counting from there.

Computers, however, cannot count in decimal. Computer hardware uses a system where values are represented internally as a series of voltage differences. For example, in most computers, a +5V charge is represented as a &quot;1&quot; digit, and a 0V value is represented as a &quot;0&quot; digit. There are no other digits possible! Thus, computers must use a numbering system that has only two digits(0 and 1): the &quot;Binary&quot;, or &quot;base-2&quot;, number system.

== Binary Numbers ==

Understanding the binary number system is difficult for many students at first. It may help to start with a decimal number, since that is more familiar. It is possible to write a number like 1234 in &quot;expanded notation,&quot; so that the value of each place is shown:

&lt;math&gt;1234_{10} = 1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + 3 \times 10^1 + 4 \times 10^0 = 1000 + 200 + 30 + 4&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that each digit is multiplied by successive powers of 10, since this a decimal, or ''base 10'' system. The &quot;ones&quot; digit (&quot;4&quot; in the example) is multiplied by &lt;math&gt;10^0&lt;/math&gt;, or &quot;1&quot;. Each digit to the left of the &quot;ones&quot; digit is multiplied by the next higher power of 10 and that is added to the preceding value.

Now, do the same with a binary number; but since this is a &quot;base 2&quot; number, replace powers of 10 with powers of 2:

&lt;math&gt;1011_2 = 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 11_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

The subscripts indicate the base. Note that in the above equations:

&lt;math&gt;1011_2 = 11_{10}&lt;/math&gt; 

Binary numbers ''are the same as their equivalent decimal numbers,'' they are just a different way to represent a given quantity. To be very simplistic, it does not really matter if you have &lt;math&gt;1011_2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;11_{10}&lt;/math&gt; apples, you can still make a pie.

== Bits ==

The term '''Bits''' is short for the phrase '''B'''inary Dig'''its'''. Each bit is a single binary value: 1 or zero. Computers generally represent a 1 as a positive voltage (5 volts or 3.3 volts are common values), and a zero as 0 volts.

=== Most Significant Bit and Least Significant Bit ===

In the decimal number 48723, the &quot;4&quot; digit represents the largest power of 10 (or &lt;math&gt;10^4&lt;/math&gt;), and the 3 digit represents the smallest power of 10 (&lt;math&gt;10^0&lt;/math&gt;). Therefore, in this number, 4 is the most significant digit and 3 is the least significant digit. Consider a situation where a caterer needs to prepare 156 meals for a wedding. If the caterer makes an error in the least significant digit and accidentally makes 157 meals, it is  not a big problem. However, if the caterer makes a mistake on the most significant digit, 1, and prepares 256 meals, that will be a big problem!

Now, consider a binary number: 101011. The Most Significant Bit (MSB) is the left-most bit, because it represents the greatest power of 2 (&lt;math&gt;2^5&lt;/math&gt;). The Least Significant Bit (LSB) is the right-most bit and represents the least power of 2 (&lt;math&gt;2^0&lt;/math&gt;).

Notice that MSB and LSB are not the same as the notion of &quot;significant figures&quot; that is used in other sciences. The decimal number 123000 has only 3 significant figures, but the most significant digit is 1 (the left-most digit), and the least significant digit is 0 (the right-most digit).

;Nibble : a Nibble is 4 bits long. Nibbles can hold values from 0 to 15 (in decimal).

;Byte : a Byte is 8 bits long. Bytes can hold values from 0 to 255 (in decimal).

;Word : a Word is 16 bits, or 2 bytes long. Words can hold values from 0 to 65535 (in Decimal). There is occasionally some confusion between this definition and that of a &quot;machine word&quot;. See Machine Word below.

;Double-word : a Double-word is 2 words long, or 4 bytes long. These are also known simply as &quot;DWords&quot;. DWords are also 32 bits long. 32-bit computers therefore, manipulate data that is the size of DWords.

;Quad-word : a Quad-word is 2 DWords long, 4 words long, and 8 bytes long. They are known simply as &quot;QWords&quot;. QWords are 64 bits long, and are therefore the default data size in 64-bit computers.

;Machine Word : A machine word is the length of the standard data size of a given machine. For instance, a 32-bit computer has a 32-bit machine word. Likewise 64-bit computers have a 64-bit machine word. Occasionally the term &quot;machine word&quot; is shortened to simply &quot;word&quot;, leaving some ambiguity as to whether we are talking about a regular &quot;word&quot; or a machine word.

== Negative Numbers ==

It would seem logical that to create a negative number in binary, the reader would only need to prefix the number with a &quot;–&quot; sign. For instance, the binary number 1101 can become negative simply by writing it as &quot;–1101&quot;. This seems all fine and dandy until you realize that computers and digital circuits do not understand minus sign. Digital circuits only have bits, and so bits must be used to distinguish between positive and negative numbers. With this in mind, there are a variety of schemes that are used to make binary numbers negative or positive: Sign and Magnitude, One's Complement, and Two's Complement.

=== Sign and Magnitude ===

Under a '''Sign and Magnitude''' scheme, the MSB of a given binary number is used as a &quot;flag&quot; to determine if the number is positive or negative. If the MSB = 0, the number is positive, and if the MSB = 1, the number is negative. This scheme seems awfully simple, except for one simple fact: arithmetic of numbers under this scheme is very hard. Let's say we have 2 nibbles: 1001 and 0111. Under sign and magnitude, we can translate them to read: -001 and +111. In decimal then, these are the numbers –1 and +7.

When we add them together, the sum of –1 + 7 = 6 should be the value that we get. However:

  001
 +111
 ----
  000

And that isn't right. What we need is a decision-making construct to determine if the MSB is set or not, and if it is set, we subtract, and if it is not set, we add. This is a big pain, and therefore sign and magnitude is not used.

=== One's Complement ===

Let's now examine a scheme where we define a negative number as being the logical inverse of a positive number. We will use the same &quot;!&quot; operator to express a logical inversion on multiple bits. For instance, !001100 = 110011. 110011 is binary for 51, and 001100 is binary for 12. but in this case, we are saying that 001100 = –110011, or 110011(binary) = -12 decimal. let's perform the addition again:

  001100 (12)
 +110011 (-12)
 -------
  111111

We can see that if we invert 000000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; we get the value 111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. and therefore 111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is negative zero! What exactly is negative zero? it turns out that in this scheme, positive zero and negative zero are identical.

However, one's complement notation suffers because it has two representations for zero: all 0 bits, or all 1 bits. As well as being clumsy, this will also cause problems when we want to check quickly to see if a number is zero. This is an extremely common operation, and we want it to be easy, so we create a new representation, two's complement.

=== Two's Complement ===

Two's complement is a number representation that is very similar to one's complement. We find the negative of a number X using the following formula:

 -X = !X + 1

Let's do an example. If we have the binary number 11001 (which is 25 in decimal), and we want to find the representation for -25 in twos complement, we follow two steps:

#Invert the numbers:
#:11001 → 00110
#Add 1:
#:00110 + 1 = 00111

Therefore –11001 = 00111. Let's do a little addition:

  11001
 +00111
 ------
  00000

Now, there is a carry from adding the two MSBs together, but this is digital logic, so we discard the carrys. It is important to remember that digital circuits have capacity for a certain number of bits, and any extra bits are discarded.

Most modern computers use two's complement.

Below is a diagram showing the representation held by these systems for all four-bit combinations:

[[image:Binary Representations.svg|center]]

== Signed vs Unsigned ==

One important fact to remember is that computers are dumb. A computer doesnt know whether or not a given set of bits represents a signed number, or an unsigned number (or, for that matter, and number of other data objects). It is therefore important for the programmer (or the programmers trusty compiler) to keep track of this data for us. Consider the bit pattern 100110:

*Unsigned: 38 (decimal)
*Sign+Magnitude: -6
*One's Complement: -25
*Two's Complement: -26

See how the representation we use changes the value of the number! It is important to understand that bits are bits, and the computer doesn't know what the bits represent. It is up to the circuit designer and the programmer to keep track of what the numbers mean.

== Character Data ==

We've seen how binary numbers can represent unsigned values, and how they can represent negative numbers using various schemes. But now we have to ask ourselves, how do binary numbers represent other forms of data, like text characters? The answer is that there exist different schemes for converting binary data to characters. Each scheme acts like a map to convert a certain bit pattern into a certain character. There are 3 popular schemes: ASCII, UNICODE and EBCDIC.

=== ASCII === 

The ASCII code (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common code for mapping bits to characters. ASCII uses only 7 bits, although since computers can only deal with 8-bit bytes at a time, ASCII characters have an unused 8th bit as the MSB. ASCII codes 0-31 are &quot;Control codes&quot; which are characters that are not printable to the screen, and are used by the computer to handle certain operations. code 32 is a single space (hit the space bar). The character code for the character '1' is 49, '2' is 50, etc... notice in ASCII '2' = '1' + 1 (the character 1 plus the integer number 1)). This is difficult for many people to grasp at first, so don't worry if you are confused.

Capital letters start with 'A' = 65 to 'Z' = 90. The lower-case letters start with 'a' = 97 to 'z' = 122.

Almost all the rest of the ASCII codes are different punctuation marks.

=== Extended ASCII ===

Since computers use data that is the size of bytes, it made no sense to have ASCII only contain 7 bits of data (which is a maximum of 128 character codes). Many companies therefore incorporated the extra bit into an &quot;Extended ASCII&quot; code set. These extended sets have a maximum of 256 characters to use. The first 128 characters are the original ASCII characters, but the next 128 characters are platform-defined. Each computer maker could define their own characters to fill in the last 128 slots.

=== UNICODE === 

When computers began to spread around the world, other languages began to be used by computers. Before too long, each country had its own character code sets, to represent their own letters. It is important to remember that some alphabets in the world have more than 256 characters! Therefore, the UNICODE standard was proposed. There are many different representations of UNICODE. Some of them use 2-byte characters, and others use different representations. The first 128 characters of the UNICODE set are the original ASCII characters.

For a more in-depth discussion of UNICODE, see [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html this website].

=== EBCDIC ===

EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange format) is a character code that was originally proposed by IBM, but was passed in favor of ASCII. IBM however still uses EBCDIC in some of its super computers, mainframes, and server systems.

== Octal ==

Octal is just like decimal and binary in that once one column is &quot;full&quot;, you move onto the next. It uses the numbers 0−7 as digits, and because there a binary multiple (8=2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of digits available, it has a useful property that it is easy to convert between octal and binary numbers. Consider the binary number: 101110000. To convert this number to octal, we must first break it up into groups of 3 bits: 101, 110, 000. Then we simply add up the values of each bit:

*&lt;math&gt;101_2 = 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 5_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;110_2 = 1 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 6_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;000_2 = 0_8&lt;/math&gt;

And then we string all the octal digits together:
:101110000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 560&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Hexadecimal ==

Hexadecimal is a very common data representation. It is more common than octal, because it represents four binary digits per digit, and many digital circuits use multiples of four as their data widths.

Hexadecimal uses a base of 16. However, there is a difficulty in that it requires 16 digits, and the common decimal number system only has ten digits to play with (0 through 9). So, to have the necessary number of digits to play with, we use the letters A through F, in addition to the digits 0-9. After the unit column is full, we move onto the &quot;16's&quot; column, just as in binary and decimal.

| D || 13 || 15 || 1101
|-
| E || 14 || 16 || 1110
|-
| F || 15 || 17 || 1111
|}

== Hexadecimal Notation ==

Depending on the source code you are reading, hexadecimal may be notated in one of several ways:

*&lt;tt&gt;0xaa11&lt;/tt&gt;: ANSI C notation. The &lt;tt&gt;0x&lt;/tt&gt; prefix indicates that the remaining digits are to be interpreted as hexadeximal. For example, &lt;tt&gt;0x1000&lt;/tt&gt;, which is equal to 4096 in decimal.

*&lt;tt&gt;\xaa11&lt;/tt&gt;: &quot;C string&quot; notation.

*&lt;tt&gt;0aa11h&lt;/tt&gt;: Typical assembly language notation, indicated by the &lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt; suffix.  The leading &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; (zero) ensures the assembler does not mistakenly interpret the number as a label or symbol.

*&lt;tt&gt;$aa11&lt;/tt&gt;: Another common assembly language notation, widely used in 6502/65816 assembly language programming.

*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#AA11&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;: BASIC notation.

*&lt;tt&gt;$aa11$&lt;/tt&gt;: Business BASIC notation.

*&lt;tt&gt;aa11&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;: Mathematical notation, with the subscript indicating the number base.

*&lt;tt&gt;16'hAA11&lt;/tt&gt;: [[:w:Verilog|Verilog]] notation, where the &quot;16&quot; is the total length in bits.

Both uppercase and lowercase letters may be used. Lowercase is generally preferred in a Linux, UNIX or C environment, while uppercase is generally preferred in a mainframe or COBOL environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Algorithms=
The following is a skeleton for the content of D1 algorithms, with the content taken from AQA, OCR, OCR MEI and Edexcel's specifications. Not all specifications include all of the following content.

==Introduction to Algorithms==

===What is an algorithm?===
An algorithm is a precise set of instructions which, when followed, will solve a problem. They can be presented in various forms, e.g. words, pictures, flow diagrams. Recipes, knitting patterns, instructions to set a VCR or build a desk are all examples of algorithms we may encounter in everyday life.
 
===Why use algorithms?===
The main advantage of algorithms is that we can then use computational methods of solving problems. It's rather easy for one to put the numbers 2, 5, 3, 1 and 4 in ascending order, but it would take much, much longer for one to sort a list of 1000 random numbers. Also having an algorithm means that someone else can achieve the same result as you, without having to work out how to do it. Specifically having an algorithm may allow a computer to perform the actions.

===Order===

===Flow Diagrams===
[[Image:BasicFlowDiagram.png|right|Basic Flow Diagram]]
You may need to be able to follow or create flow diagrams in order to demonstrate an algorithm. There are three basic shapes used:

* Oval, used for start &amp; stop and input &amp; output.
* Rectangle, used for calculations and instructions.
* Diamond, used for yes/no questions.
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==Sorting Algorithms==

====An example====
Given a deck of 52 cards to be sorted according to their suit; their position in the current sequence of cards is given a number:
#What suit is card 1? It is HEARTS.
#What suit is card 2? It is SPADES. We want a deck with spades before hearts. Therefore we exchange the two cards, and go back one step. If we are already at the beginning, then ignore the need to go back one step.
#What suit is card 1 now? It is SPADES.
#What suit is card 2 now? It is HEARTS. These two cards are in the right order, therefore we do NOT interchange them, but go to the next card in the deck.
#What suit is card 3? It is HEARTS. It is the same as the previous card, therefore we carry on to the next card in the deck.
...........
AND SO ON, until we get to the card that is one before the last card. We compare, exchange if necessary, and then stop sorting.
*Next we separate the HEARTS, or some other suit, as we wish, from the 52-card deck, have now only a deck of 13 cards, and sort this smaller deck of cards according to 2,3, ... J,Q,K,A and do this with the other 3 suits too, one at a time.
*After that we are nearly all done, combine the 4 sets of 13 cards each into a big set of 52 cards and stop.

===Bubble Sort===
For a set of numbers, the first number is compared to the number to the right of it. &lt;br&gt;

13, 2, 4, 3, 82&lt;br&gt;

13&gt;2 so it moves to the right. &lt;br&gt;

2, 13, 4, 3, 82&lt;br&gt;

13&gt;4 so it moves to the right. &lt;br&gt;

2, 4, 13, 3, 82&lt;br&gt;

13&gt;3 so it moves to the right.&lt;br&gt;

2, 4, 3, 13, 82&lt;br&gt;

13&lt;82 so it stays.&lt;br&gt;

At the end of first pass: 2, 4, 3, 13, 82&lt;br&gt;
At the end of second pass: 2, 4, 3, 13, 82&lt;br&gt;
At the end of third pass: 2, 3, 4, 13 82&lt;br&gt;

This set only needed 2 passes, but on a larger data set it can get quite large. The maximum number of passes is equal to the size of the set, provided the set items are unique.

===Shuttle Sort===
From a set of numbers, one selects the first two numbers and underlines them. These two are the ones that get sorted in the first pass.&lt;br&gt;
In the second pass, the range of numbers to be sorted increases by one, so the first three numbers are compared and sorted into their order. &lt;br&gt;
And so forth until all the numbers are covered in the range and sorted. &lt;br&gt;
1st pass - &lt;u&gt;23, 2&lt;/u&gt;, 4, 8, 9  - 23&gt;2 so 2 is sorted to the left.&lt;br&gt;
2nd pass - &lt;u&gt;2, 23, 4&lt;/u&gt;, 8, 9  - 23&gt;4 so 4 is sorted to the left.&lt;br&gt;
3rd pass - &lt;u&gt;2, 4, 23, 8&lt;/u&gt;, 9 - The numbers are sorted&lt;br&gt;
4th pass - &lt;u&gt;2, 4, 8, 23, 9&lt;/u&gt; - The numbers are sorted&lt;br&gt;
Final set of numbers = 2, 4, 8, 9, 23 - The numbers are sorted&lt;br&gt;

===Quick Sort===
Using the midpoint as the pivot, (or whichever value it asks you to use in the question) perform a shuttle sort on each of the sub lists. Continue until all terms but one have been used as a pivot.

===Insertion Sort===

===Shell Sort===
* Divide the set of numbers in n/2 sublists. 
* The sublists are shuttle sorted
* The data range is recombined and split into half the number of the previous sublists.
* The data range are shuttle sorted again.
* Repeat until the number of sublists = 2

==Packing Algorithms==

===Full-Bin===
The 'full bin' algorithm is one in which combinations of objects which would fill a 'bin' are grouped together to fill as few bins as possible. The remaining objects are then placed in other bins.
This is best illustrated by the example below (NB - this is NOT an exam question and does not represent the level of complexity that can be expected on the actual paper).

Q) A computer software company needs to publish its software on floppy disks of capacity 200kB. The files are of size 25kB, 90kB, 30kB, 120kB, 190kB, 10kB, 70kB, 40kB, 100kB, 140kB and 80kB. How many floppy disks are required? Use the 'full-bin' algorithm to arrive at a solution.

A) Start by looking along the list to find values that add up to 200. There is no particular method for this (everyone seems to do it differently), but I find it helps to find combinations that add up to full 10's etc. Fill the 'bins' with these combinations:

Bin | Files
-------------
A   | 120, 80
-------------
B   | 190, 10
-------------
C   | 70, 40, 90
-------------

This leaves 25, 30, 100 and 140. It makes sense to get as close as possible to a full bin using the remaining values:

(140 + 25 + 30) = 195 &lt;- so place these values in the next bin, leaving the 100 in the final bin.

Solution:

Bin | Files
-------------
A   | 120, 80
-------------
B   | 190, 10
-------------
C   | 70, 40, 90
-------------
D   | 140, 25, 30
-------------
E   | 100
-------------

5 disks are required to fit all the files.

===First-Fit===
Place each object, in turn in the first available space in which it will fit.

===First-Fit Decreasing===
Reorder the boxes in ''decreasing'' order of size using one of the sorting algorithms, then apply the first-fit algorithm to the reordered list.

==Searching Algorithms==

===Binary Search===

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The Government of Canada had a significant interest to encourage people with valuable skills to immigrate to Canada. It was for this reason that they created the Federal Skilled Worker class of immigrant to allow those with sufficient language skills, education, and experience in an occupation that is needed in Canada, to enter the country.

==Basic requirements==
An applicant under the Federal Skilled Worker program need not have a job already, but only must show that they are skilled enough to contribute to Canada.

==Application procedure==

To be eligable to apply as a Federal Skilled Worker the applicant must:
* be 18 years old or more.
* meet the required amount of assets given the size of the family.
* have a score of at least 67 on the required factors.
* have a medical examination and security clearance for the applicant and all dependants. 


===Minimum Assets===
The applicant must show that they possess a minimum amount of assets in their bank account. The amount depends on the number of family members. These amounts can be waived if the applicant already has arranged employment.

|}
[table last checked on March 24, 2006]

===Point System===
Acceptance to the federal skilled worker program depends entirely on the score awarded from a set of criteria. An applicant needs at least a score of 67 combined from the points calculated from five factors: Education (max 25pts), Language Skills (max 24pts), Experience Age(max 21pts), Arranged Employment (max 10pts), and Adaptability (max 10pts).


===Alternative to the point system===
In the case where the applicant does not have the required number of points, they may still make a request for &quot;Substituted Evaluation&quot;. The immigration officer has the discretion to accept an applicant if the applicant can show that they are able to become &quot;economically established&quot; in Canada.

===Forms===
The government offers a [http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/guides/EG7.pdf guide] to fill out the application, much of which will mirror what is in this section.

The following are the forms that are needed:
# [[Immigrating to Canada/Application for Permanent Residence in Canada (IMM 0008)|Application for Permanent Residence in Canada (IMM 0008)]] [http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm0008egen.pdf form]

# Use of a Representative [IMM 5476]  (optional) [http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/forms/IMM5476E.PDF form]

==Processing times==
All applications are mailed to the processing center in Buffalo, New York.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Jurisdiction ==

The ECJ was quick to stamp its authority in a series of cases clarifying the position of the different types of legislation made by the institutions of the European Community.

The first case was Van Gend en Loos which established that EC law is supreme over existing Dutch law. 

;Costa v. ENEL
:New conflicting national legislation made after EC law could not override EC law.

;Internationalle Handelgesellschaft
:EC law prevailed even over conflicting constitutional law. In this case it was German Basic Law, note that the German Administrative Court ignored the ECJ's ruling.

;Simmenthal Spa
:Conflicting national law could be disapplied immediately without waiting for it to be repealed.

Basic recipe on how to cook artichokes.  Similar results can be obtained using the [[Cookbook:Steamed Artichoke|steamed artichoke recipe]], however, using the [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]] is much faster.

==Ingredients==
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichoke]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], juiced
*[[Cookbook:Water|Water]]
*;Seasonings (optional)
**[[Cookbook:Parsley|Parsley]]
**1-2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] cloves per artichoke
**[[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
**1/8 cup (30 ml) white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]].

==Procedure==

#Cut off top 1/3 of the artichoke, and all but 1 inch of the stem.
#Remove base leaves and cut off the tips of the higher leaves.
#Sprinkle artichoke with lemon juice to preserve color.
#Place artichoke stem up in a microwave safe dish tall enough to place lid without touching the artichoke.
#Fill dish with 1 inch (3 cm) of water and any of the optional seasonings.
#Cover and microwave on high for 6-8 minutes, and allow to rest for 1-2 minutes.  The artichoke is cooked when a [[Cookbook:Paring knife|paring knife]] can be inserted into the heart without resistance.
#Remove artichoke from the dish and place upside down to drain.
#Serve whole, with one or more dips. Diners should remove a leaf, dip the base of the leaf in the dip, and eat the fleshy base of the leaf.
#When all the leaves are gone, remove the choke, cut the heart of the artichoke into bite sized pieces, and serve with the dip.

      <comment>Rejected the last text change (by [[Special:Contributions/130.118.183.157|130.118.183.157]]) and restored revision 1786685 by BenTels</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Environment|Environment]] module we introduced the idea of an environment variable as a general way of storing small pieces of data. In this module we take an in-depth look at using those variables: 'variable expansion', 'parameter substitution' or just 'substitution'.

==Substitution==
The reason that using a variable is called substitution is that the shell literally replaces each reference to any variable with its value. This is done while evaluating the command-line, which means that the variable substitution is made ''before'' the command is actually executed.

The simplest way of using a variable is the way we've already seen, prepending the variable name with a '$'. So for instance:

{{code:Output|Simple use of a variable|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ USER=JoeSixpack
$ echo $USER&lt;/source&gt;
|JoeSixpack
|The value JoeSixpack is substituted for $USER before the echo command is executed.}}

Of course, once the substitution is made the result is still just the text that was in the variable. The interpretation of that text is still done by whatever program is run. So for example:

{{code:Output|Variables do not make magic|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ USER=JoeSixpack
$ ls $USER&lt;/source&gt;
|ls: cannot access JoeSixpack: No such file or directory
|Just because the text came from a variable, doesn't mean the file exists.}}

Basic variable expansion is already quite flexible. You can use it as described above, but you can also use variables to create longer strings. For instance, if you want to set the log directory for an application to the &quot;log&quot; directory in your home directory, you might fill in the setting like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$HOME/log&lt;/source&gt;

And if you're going to use that setting more often, you might want to create your own variable like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;LOGDIR=$HOME/log&lt;/source&gt;

And, of course, if you want specific subdirectories for logs for different programs, then the logs for the Wyxliz application go into directory

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$LOGDIR/Wyxliz/&lt;/source&gt;

==Substitution forms==
The Bourne Shell has a number of different syntaxes for variable substitution, each with its own meaning and use. In this section we examine these syntaxes.

===Basic variable substitution===
We've already talked at length about basic variable substitution: you define a variable, stick a '$' in front of it, the shell substitutes the value for the variable. By now you're probably bored of hearing about it.

But we've not talked about one situation that you might run into with basic variable substitution. Consider the following:

{{code:Output|Adding some text to a variable's value|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ANIMAL=duck
$ echo One $ANIMAL, two $ANIMALs&lt;/source&gt;
|One duck, two
|Uhhh.... we're missing something...}}

So what went wrong here? Well, obviously the shell substituted nothing for the ANIMAL variable, but why? Because with the extra 's' the shell thought we were asking for the non-existent ANIMALs variable. But what gives there? We've used variables in the middle of strings before (as in '/home/ANIMAL/logs'). But an 's' is not a '/': an 's' can be a valid part of a variable name, so the shell cannot tell the difference. In cases where you explicitly have to separate the variable from other text, you can use braces:

{{code:Output|Adding some text to a variable's value, take II|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ANIMAL=duck
$ echo One $ANIMAL, two ${ANIMAL}s&lt;/source&gt;
|One duck, two ducks
|That's better!}}

Both cases (with and without the braces) count as basic variable substitution and the rules are exactly the same. Just remember not to leave any spaces between the braces and the variable name.

===Substitution with a default value===
Since a variable can be empty, you'll often write code in your scripts to check that mandatory variables actually have a value. But in the case of optional variables it is usually more convenient not to check, but to use a default value for the case that a variable is not defined. This case is actually so common that the Bourne Shell defines a special syntax for it: the dash. Since a dash can mean other things to the shell as well, you have to combine it with braces &amp;mdash; the final result looks like this:

{{bcode:Example
|'''${'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''varname''[:]-''default''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''}'''
|Where ''varname'' is the name of the variable&lt;br/&gt;
and ''default'' is the value used if ''varname'' is not defined}}

Again, don't leave any spaces between the braces and the rest of the text. The way to use this syntax is as follows:

{{code:Output|Default values|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ THIS_ONE_SET=Hello
$ echo $THIS_ONE_SET ${THIS_ONE_NOT:-World}&lt;/source&gt;
|Hello World|}}

Compare that to this:

{{code:Output|Default not needed|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ TEXT=aaaaaahhhhhhhh
$ echo Say ${TEXT:-bbbbbbbbbb}&lt;/source&gt;
|Say aaaaaahhhhhhhh|}}

Interestingly, the colon is optional; so ${VAR:-default} has the same result as ${VAR-default}.

===Substitution with default assignment===
As an extension to default values, there's a syntax that not only supplies a default value but assigns it to the unset variable at the same time. It looks like this:

{{bcode:Example
|'''${'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''varname''[:]&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;''default''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''}'''
|Where ''varname'' is the name of the variable&lt;br/&gt;
and ''default'' is the value used '''and assigned''' if ''varname'' is not defined}}

As usual, avoid spaces in between the braces. Here's an example that demonstrates how this syntax works:

{{code:Basic|Default value assignment
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ echo $NEWVAR

$ echo ${NEWVAR:=newval}
newval
$ echo $NEWVAR
newval&lt;/source&gt;}}

As with the default value syntax, the colon is optional.

===Substitution for actual value===
This substitution is sort of a quick test to see if a variable is defined (and that's usually what it's used for). It's sort of the reverse of the default value syntax and looks like this:

{{bcode:Example
|'''${'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''varname''[:]+''substitute''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''}'''
|Where ''varname'' is the name of the variable&lt;br/&gt;
and ''substitute'' is the value used if ''varname'' is defined}}

This syntax returns the substitute value if the variable '''is''' defined. That sounds counterintuitive at first, especially if you ask what is returned if the variable is '''not''' defined &amp;mdash; and learn that the value is nothing. Here's an example:

{{code:Basic|Actual value substitution
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ echo ${NEWVAR:+newval}

$ NEWVAR=oldval
$ echo ${NEWVAR:+newval}
newval&lt;/source&gt;}}

So what could possibly be the use of this notation? Well, it's used often in scripts that have to check whether lots of variables are set or not. In this case the fact that a variable has a value means that a certain option has been activated, so you're interested in knowing that the variable ''has'' a value, not what that value is. It looks sort of like this (pseudocode, this won't actually work in the shell):

{{code:Basic|Default value assignment|if ${SPECIFIC_OPTION_VAR:+optionset} &lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt; optionset then ...}}

Of course, in this notation the colon is optional as well.

===Substitution with value check===
This final syntax is sort of a debug check to check whether or not a variable is set. It looks like this:

{{bcode:Example
|'''${'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''varname''[:]?''message''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''}'''
|Where ''varname'' is the name of the variable&lt;br/&gt;
and ''message'' is the printed if ''varname'' is not defined}}

With this syntax, if the variable is defined everything is okay. Otherwise, the message is printed and the command or script exits with a non-zero exit status. Or, if there is no message, the text &quot;parameter null or not set&quot; is printed. As usual the colon is optional and you may not have a space between the colon and the variable name.

You can use this syntax to check that the mandatory variables for your scripts have been set and to print an error message if they are not.

{{code:Basic|Default value assignment
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ echo ${SOMEVAR:?has not been set}
-sh: SOMEVAR: has not been set
$ echo ${SOMEVAR:?}
-sh: SOMEVAR: parameter null or not set&lt;/source&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Example complex vocabulary entry (?)==
(Ideally this would all be tabular, or formatted nicely in some other way so as to distinuish the &quot;core&quot; information from the extended information.)

*おはようございます: good morning. (See also: [[User:Telamon/Japanese#Greetings|Common Japanese Greetings]].) (Grammar note: this is an example of a ''[[Japanese:Grammar:Formal Conjugations|formal i-adjective conjugation]]''.)
*はじめまして: how do you do? (Grammar note: see [[Japanese:Grammar:Special Verbs:始める|&lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;始&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;はじ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;める notes]].)

==やってみる - Try It (different take)==
Duration: 1-5 minutes

*sample vocabulary list:
**おはようございます: good morning (formal)
**おはよう: good morning (informal)
**こんにちは: good day
**こんばんは: good evening

*sample activity:
**Practice greeting other students based on the current time of day. What would you say to someone if you ran into them six hours from now?
**What would you say if you were speaking to a social superior, such as your teacher? What would you say to a close acquaintance?
**If you are alone, practice thinking of people in your life and how you would great them differently. Say each greeting phrase out loud as you think of the person.

==Common Japanese Greetings (sample cultural note)==
Much like English, the Japanese use different greetings for different times of day. Also like English, the Japanese use a different, more formal set of greetings when dealing with people of differing social levels. Where in English you might say &quot;mornin'&quot; to your friends and &quot;good morning&quot; to your instructors, the Japanese instead choose between おはよう (for less-formal relationships) and おはようございます (for social superiors or more formalized relationships).

As in English, the greeting expressions have a direct relationship to the idea being expressed, but not necessarily the same thing that would be literally translated. As examples:

{| style=&quot;width: auto; border: 1px #333 solid; background-color: #f2f2f2; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid;&quot;| 今日は。
| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid; width: 60%;&quot;| &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;今&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;こん&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rb&gt;日&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;にち&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt; (today) は (topic marker)
| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid;&quot;| Good day.
|- 
| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid;&quot;| 今晩は。|| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid;&quot;| &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;今&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;こん&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rb&gt;晩&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;ばん&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt; (tonight) は (topic marker)|| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid;&quot;|Good night.
|-
| | おはようございます。|| お (honorific) &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;早&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;はよ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;う ([[Japanese:Grammar:Some Fancy Adjective Conjugation|some fancy conjugation]] of &quot;early&quot;) ございます (it is, very polite)|| Good morning.
|}

If walking up to someone and announcing that it is, in fact, early seems like an odd greeting, think about some of the many varied things that English speakers accept without a second thought: &quot;Top of the morning to you.&quot;; &quot;Howdy.&quot;; and &quot;G'mornin'.&quot; to name a few.

There are other subtle differences not clearly shown by the literal translations above. Where in English, you would wish someone in the late night hours (midnight until sunrise) &quot;good morning&quot;, the Japanese consider this time period an extension of the evening and therefore will greet each other with こんばんは.

[[Image:Pixareyes-iris blueeye.png|thumb|The final result, with a blue iris.]]
Note: This tutorial uses the same modelling and texturing technique described in the well-known MAX tutorial by Adam Baroody (http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eyes.html). The sole purpose of my tutorial is to make this technique more popular among the Blender users by explaining how to achieve the same result with Blender.

The goal of this tutorial is to make a Pixar-looking eye. One of the main reasons that Pixar's characters really convey life is in their eyes. They have depth, you can see how the eye not only shines but it &quot;collects&quot; light. You may think that you can't achieve this effect without raytracing but you're wrong. The secret of this depth is in the modelling of the eye. Let's see how it works!

==Parts of the Eye==
In this picture you can see the &quot;ingredients&quot; of the eye model. The blue mesh at the left is the cornea. Its shape allows for a small spot of specular light to appear on it even if the light is in a far side position. The mesh next to it is the iris. Now notice how it's a bit concave. That's the tricky part - the shape of the iris allows for a wide soft specular light to appear at the opposite side of the lamp direction. This fakes refracted light from the cornea and makes the illusion of &quot;collecting&quot; light and creates depth. The next mesh is the eye pupil - a simple circle.The pupil size is the same size as the iris hole. You can position it close to the inner side of the iris. And finally - the eyeball. It's a simple sphere with a hole in it.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: left; height: 20px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

I won't go deep into modelling of each element - it uses Blender's subdivision surfaces and it's quite simple as you can see.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Pixareyes-Eye_mesh.gif]]

==Materials==
Now let's look at the materials. 

===Sclera===

To make the eye white, press NUM3 to go into side view and add a UVsphere with 8 segments and 8 rings. To create the hole at the front of the eyeball, delete the 8 triangular faces that make up one end of the eyeball. Ctrl+Tab+3 to go into face select mode, B for border mode and select the middle 8 triangles as shown below, press Delete or the X button and LMB on Faces.

[[Image:Cornea-example.jpg]]

The resulting hole will be ringed by 8 vertices (which you could subsequently extrude and use to help you model the sections below - just a suggestion for those who feel capable)

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclera eye white] has white color and high values for Spec and Hard (depends on the lighting), as well as a moderately high Ref value (0.700 - 0.800). Optionally you can use a reflection map to make it look more wet but I usually don't do this.

(Noob note: Using a Phong specular shader turned to work quite well.)

(User: Make sure shadow buttons are off or it will black out the iris. Spec and Hard are located in the Shaders tab.)

===Iris===

* Loop select the opening of the eye (ALT+RMB click edge of opening).

* Duplicate the loop (SHIFT+DKEY). Move the new loop away from the eye a bit perpendicular to the opening. 

* With the loop still selected, extrude (EKEY). Without moving the extrusion, press ENTER.

* Resize by half (SKEY then .KEY then NUM5 then ENTER).

* Move the inner loop back toward the eye a bit to form the concave shape.

* Create a [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Quickie Material|new material]] and create a [[Blender 3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Quickie_Texture |new texture]] called iris. Then hit F6 or click the spotty square icon [[File:Blendertexture.png]] to open the texture panel, choose Image as the texture type and then press Load Image button and use the image below.&lt;br&gt;





 [[Image:Pixareyes-iriscoloredit.png|Setting the iris color.]]

Here is the eye texture taken from the picture above
[[Image:Iris.png|The iris]]

'''Alternatively''', you can create an image like this procedurally, using the technique described [https://vimeo.com/9295010 here].


All that is required now is a bit of tweeking of the texture size using the Xsize and Ysize values in the Map Input tab, and scaling the pupil hole size in Edit mode.  Also please remember to change in the map input settings from 'flat' to 'cube'.
You can tweak the RGB values and brightness/contrast of the image to achieve the appearance you want. Use a smaller value for Hard (about 50) otherwise you'll have a too shiny look instead of soft specular that fakes refracted light. The Spec value depends on the energy and distance of the light that illuminates it. Generally you'll need to take care that the refracted light on the iris should be no more than half as bright as the small specular spot on the cornea - otherwise you'll achieve the bad effect of two specular spots. Oh, another important thing - join the four meshes before tweaking the texture coordinates. Otherwise you'll have to do the job twice after you join them, because the texture space is changed. And activate shadeless button.

===Pupil===
The material for the pupil is a simple black color with the &quot;shadeless&quot; button on.

===Cornea===
The cornea uses a transparent material ('''alpha = 0.1''') with '''Spec = .6''', '''Hard = 255''' and '''SpecTra = 1'''. &quot;'''Ztransp'''&quot; should also be turned on (found under Links and Pipelines tab). The cornea is simply a piece that fits exactly in the middle of the hole in the eye white. Make sure that the 'Traceable' button, under Render Pipeline, in the Links and Pipelines tab, is switched off. Noob note: I found it helps to turn off Shadebuff since, as far as I know, you don't generally want the cornea to cast a shadow.


Noob question: I don't know where is the &quot;SpecTra&quot; Value. I'm working on 2.46. Thanks a lot.
You can find &quot;SpecTra&quot; under &quot;Mirror Transp&quot;

Noob Question: My cornea isn't transparent. I don't know where Traceable is since I'm using 2.6x

==Lighting==
The lighting is simple - move the eye to a new layer, create a new lamp and make the lamp affect only this layer. Position the lamp at a good angle so you have a small shiny spot of specular light on one side of the iris and a soft spot of &quot;refracted&quot; light on the other side. You can use a backlight to prevent the eyeball from being too dark at the non-illuminated part.

To move the newly created lamp to a new layer, press SHIFT+M and select the second blue button and press OK. P

Noob Question: Why do you need to create a new layer?

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: left; height: 20px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

That's it! Now you're (almost) ready to start with character animation. You have a nice eye, now you only need a character for it!

==Changing the Eye Color==
You can change the color of the eye by either changing the cornea color, or by changing the iris color itself.  Changing the cornea color might be like putting on colored contacts.

===Changing the Cornea Color===
To change the cornea color, do the following:

#In the mesh which is used to create Cornea set the value of the alpha slider to 0.2 (or more if you desire)
#Change the color of the mesh to whatever color you like
#Turn off traceble &lt;br&gt; [[Image:settings1.jpg]]
#Render!
(and remember to smooth out everything by selecting the particular mesh going to edit buttons and clicking on set smooth)

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Changing the Iris Color===
To change the iris color you can either edit the iris image external from blender or you can modify the RGB values of the image when imported into Blender.

For rigging an eyeball, (making it stay in one place while turning to look at something) and other eyeball stuff, you can visit this site.  This tutorial assumes you already have the eyeball made above or one of your own.  [http://rjnlk94.googlepages.com/eyeballtutorial Click.] 5jun2009, the PDF shows no rigging, only creating an eyeball. (May 10th 2011, the site no longer exists.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The StrComp function and Option Compare Text do the same job.  As stated correctly they use a lexicographic comparison of text.  But there are two options for StrComp, these being:

0 = vbBinaryCompare - Perform a binary comparison 
1 = vbTextCompare - Perform a textual comparison 

The vbTextCompare and Option Compare Text options are indentical.  In English texts this comparison probably doesn't matter and indeed could be used for a case insensitive match.  But in other languages, say for example Norwegian it does matter and double characters such as 'ae' may be treated differently.

If in doubt, use the relational operators as these do a direct comparison.  Only use StrComp if you're interested in sorting in languages other than English. {{unsigned|62.49.20.95|15 October 2005‎}}

:Please include this in the page at the relevant place.  Also it would be helpful to everyone if you were to create an account and sign your contributions with four tilde characters like this &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Then each entry in the talk page gets the name (or pseudonym) and date and time.  Lastly, welcome to Visual Basic Classic.   --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 10:41, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

Begins ''&quot;tada examples of Paleolithic (Old Stone Age)&quot;'' I assume that's meant to be ''&quot;Today examples...&quot;'' but I'm not confident enough to correct it. Anyone know? --[[User:Bodnotbod|Bodnotbod]] 11:38, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

Tada makes no sense. I changed the word back to &quot;famous&quot;. Also I recreated the subheadings under Paleolithic Art.

==Picture is huge ==
How did the picture get so big? I looked at it and it seems to have been done correctly.

For the love of god, fix it.

== Plagiarism ==

The following paragraphs were removed because they are claimed to be plagiarism. See [http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2005/10/can_we_write_gr.html] for the claim.

Paleolithic painters drew their images using chunks of red and yellow ocher. For painting, they ground these same ochers into powders they mixed with water before applying. Large flat stones served as palettes. The painters made brushes from reeds, bristles, or twigs, and may have used a blowpipe of reeds or hollow bones to spray pigments on out-of-reach surfaces. To illuminate their work, the painters used stone lamps filled with marrow or fat, perhaps with a wick of moss.

Perhaps the best-known Paleolithic cave is that at Lascaux, near Montignac, France. Many of the animals were created by outline alone, but others are represented using colored silhouettes. On the walls of the Lascaux cave one sees, side by side, the two basic approaches to drawing and painting found repreatedly in the history of art. Although most of the animals share a common ground line, some seem to float above the viewer's head. The painting has no setting, no background, no indication of place. The Paleolithic painter was concerned solely with representing the animals, not with locating them in a specific place.

Another feature of the Lascaux paintings deserves attention. The bulls there show a convention of representing horns that has been called twisted perspective, because the viewer sees the heads in profile but the horns from the front. Thus, the painter's approach is not strictly or consistently optical. Rather, the approach is descriptive of the fact that cattle have two horns. Two horns are part of the concept &quot;bull.&quot; In strict optical-perspective profile, only one horn would be visible, but to paint the animal in that way would, as it were, amount to an incomplete definition of it.

==Venus vs Woman==

Venus denotes the Roman goddess. This term makes the Woman figure that has appeared in so many other cultures appear roman centric. I recommend having it changed.</text>

Look at a recently uploaded file - f.e. [[:Image:BasicFlowDiagram.png]], it's a good example. You can click ''edit'' and see how the licence tag is placed in image description. You just put &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PD-self}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; as it is.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book deals with the subject of the law as it relates to the Internet in general and to various topics in particular.  Most of the material will be oriented toward United States law as that is where most of the legal issues become raised, but where material is from other countries it will be identified.

Note that the protections granted by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States are either unavailable or much weaker in other countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Defamation''' is the making of a false statement about another which damages their reputation.  The rules that apply in general to written publications and letters people have written would apply to material published on the Internet.

Note: For the purposes of this article, &quot;John Johnson&quot; is a fictional person used for the example here, and does not refer to anyone with the same name.  (This is so that I don't get sued for libeling someone who just happens to have that name!)

Defamation can either be a statement which is spoken, in which case, it is ''slander''.  If the defamatory statement is in writing, it is ''libel''.  It has been held in one case that a spoken statement read from a writing also constituted libel.

Since almost all material on the Internet is written, most defamation claims regarding the Internet would constitute libel.  A sound recording such as material in a podcast would probably constitute slander.

In order for an allegedly defamatory statement to be actionable at law, certain conditions must apply.

* The statement must be untrue.  Under U.S. law, a truthful statement is an absolute defense to a charge of defamation.  In the U.K., it is possible for certain truthful statements to still constitute libel.
* The statement must not be privileged.  If one repeats material from a police report, a court proceeding, or other public document, the statement, even if untrue, is priveleged and is not actionable.  Also, repeating a statement made by the subject of the statement is also priveleged, e.g. if John says in a flippant comment that he is a child molester (&quot;I'm a child molester, yeah, right.&quot;), someone repeating that statement cannot be sued by John for saying it, since John himself is the source of the statement.  Also, certain laws specifically exclude liability for third-party comments posted on the Internet.
* The statement must be in the nature of a fact, and not an opinion.  If you say that someone is &quot;the worst writer in the world&quot; or is &quot;a worthless human being,&quot; these are subjective statements of opinion and are not actionable. Publically calling someone a child molester, a homosexual, a bastard, or any other statement which can be proven, ''if the statement is false'', is actionable as defamation.
* The statement must be ''published''.  This means that someone other than the subject has to see the statement (and other than by the subject showing it to others.)  If you send a private e-mail to someone saying that they have AIDS, that is not actionable because it was not published.  If you send the e-mail to a mailing list or post it to a USENET news group, it is actionable if it is false.
* The statement must in some way damage their reputation.  A statement about someone that would tend to make people not want to associate with them (&quot;Did you hear that John Johnson is a child molester&quot;) , accuses them of a crime (&quot;I heard that John Johnson robbed a bank and killed a cop.&quot;), or accuses them of having a &quot;loathsome disease&quot; (&quot;Did you know John Johnson has AIDS?&quot;) are examples of defamatory statements.  Calling someone a visitor from Mars or a space alien would not be defamatory since it does not in some way damage their reputation.
* The person must be a private individual, or if a &quot;public figure,&quot; the statement must either be made where the party who made it knew or should have known it was false (&quot;Reckless disregard for the truth&quot;), or was made with malice. Calling your next-door neighbor a crook is probably actionable; calling a politician who suddenly has a lot of money after being elected a crook is probably not.
* The statement must be capable of being believed. For example, there was a famous case in which a magazine ran a clearly indicated parody advertisement, that claimed a well-known minister had sex with his mother in an outhouse.  While the statement was false and would normally be defamatory, because it was admitted that no one could seriously believe the statement was true, it did not constitute libel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Trademark''' is a word, phrase, ''device'', color or sound that specifically identifies certain goods or services to the exclusion of all others of the same or similar goods or services identified by the trademark. The ''Trademark Act of 1946  (the “Lanham Act”) (15 U.S.C. §§ 1051-1127)'' was enacted to ensure that consumers are able to rely on marks in exercising their preferences, by prohibiting competitors from using marks in a manner that confuses consumers about the source of a product or service. A trademark could be applied to 
*a brand of software used on or sold over the Internet, such as Apache for the web server or Linux for the operating system.
*a particular service available over the Internet, such as the Yahoo web portal, the eBay resale service, or the Amazon book store.

      <comment>Changed &quot;eight times&quot; to &quot;six times&quot;.  In fact, I have done this on numerous books and get away with only five times.  Eight is ridiculously wasteful.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{BookbindingTOC}}

It's easy to repair paperback books using Japanese bookbinding techniques. Just punch four holes through the book near the spine and lash it together with needle and thread. You can make sketch books, scrapbooks or blank books this way, too. To make smaller books, fold several sheets of paper paper carefully into halves or quarters, clamp the stack together and punch and bind it.  Optionally, you can then slit the pages apart with a sharp knife afterwards, being careful not to cut the binding threads.

To rebind a paperback you will need:
# thin wire brads and a small hammer, or an [[Bookbinding/Awl|awl]] 
# heavy [[Bookbinding/Thread|thread]], six times as long as the book 's height
# needle
# pencil
# ruler

[[w:Binder clip|Binder clip]]s are useful, too. 

For a scrapbook or blank book, cut covers from card stock or a [[Bookbinding/Re-used materials|file folder]].

Here's what you do:

[[Image:Hole spacing for Japanese binding.PNG]] 1. Using a ruler, draw a line from top to bottom of the front cover, about 1/4&quot;from the spine. Make two marks on this line, one 1/4' down from the top of the book, the other 1/4&quot; up from the bottom. Now divide the distance between these marks into thirds and mark the two middle points.

2. Even up the pages and clamp the book together with binder clips, or weight down the front edge to keep the pages from moving. Protect your work surface with a piece of scrap wood or an old phone book as you punch a hole at each of the marked points using the awl or wire brads.

Making these holes should not damage the text in the book. Most paperback books have an inner margin of 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot;, leaving plenty of room for rebinding.

3. Thread the needle and tie the ends together with an overhand knot. Open the book a few pages and, next to the lower middle hole, push the needle through about twenty pages. Pull the thread through until the knot is snug against the pages. Go back out to the front cover by pushing the needle up through the awl hole. This step anchors the thread.

4. Now sew the rest of the book as shown in the accompanying illustrations. Pull the thread tight each time you go through a hole.

Go around the back and back up through the starting hole, then down through the other middle hole. Pull the thread tight after going through each hole.

Around the back again, then up through the top hole.

Around the back, then...

...around the top of the spine and up through the top hole again. Keep going, down through one middle hole, back up through the next, and down through the bottom hole. Keep the thread tight.

Around the back again and...

[[Image:Sewing a Japanese book-figure 6.PNG]]
...around the bottom of the spine and back through the bottom hole. Go up through the starting hole again.

[[Image:Sewing a Japanese book-figure 7.PNG]]
To finish, tie off the thread so the binding won't come loose. Do this by slipping the needle under two of the top threads coming out of starting hole and back through the loop to form a tight knot.

Run the needle back down through the starting hole and cut the leftover thread flush with the back of the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Environment Variables===
Every program inherits &quot;environment variables&quot; from the program that started it. This means that each program has the same environment variables as the program that started it. The environment of a program can change, in which case other programs later started by that program also have a changed environment.

The environment variable called '''SHELL''' contains the name of the default shell. (You might be running some other shell, but the default shell is always in &quot;SHELL&quot;.) The &quot;SHELL&quot; environment variable is set during login and inherited by the shell. When we started the &quot;printenv&quot; program, it inherited the entire environment, including &quot;SHELL&quot;, and showed &quot;SHELL&quot; to us.

Using '''printenv''' with no arguments gives the entire environment:
 $ '''printenv'''
 ...
 SHELL=/bin/bash
 ...

See [[../../Environment Variables/]] to learn about specific variables.

=== Process limits ===

Each process has limits on the following.

Limits are inherited from the parent process. The normal way to set limits is to change the limits of some shell, and then start the program from that shell. Each shell provides a different way to set limits: Bourne shell uses the '''ulimit''' command while C shell uses '''limit'''.


The following is the list of available limits, given with their ''C shell name'' (&quot;Bourne shell option&quot;). We need the ''name'' (&quot;option&quot;) to show or change the limit in the ''C'' (&quot;Bourne&quot;) shell.

 * ''cputime'' (&quot;-t SECONDS&quot;)
 * ''filesize'' (&quot;-f BLOCKS&quot;)
 * ''datasize'' (&quot;-n KILOBYTES&quot;)
 * ''stacksize'' (&quot;-s KILOBYTES&quot;)
 * ''coredumpsize'' (&quot;-c BLOCKS&quot;) can also accept &quot;unlimited&quot; instead of BLOCKS
 * ''memoryuse'' (&quot;-m KILOBYTES&quot;)
 * ''memorylocked'' (&quot;-l KILOBYTES&quot;)
 * ''maxproc'' (&quot;-p COUNT&quot;)
 * ''openfiles'' (&quot;-n COUNT&quot;)

{{TODO|todonote=Explain how to use &quot;limit&quot; or &quot;ulimit -S&quot; to set limits. Explain the danger of reducing hard limits. Explain what these limits do or refer to another chapter of this book. For example, core dump size might be covered in a chapter on crashing. }}

''Scenario: A program crashes with a message about &quot;resource temporarily unavailable&quot; or &quot;too many open files&quot;.''


Raise the limits in the shell from which you start the program. For example, to allow 512 open files per process:

 ''Bourne shell''
 $ '''ulimit -Sn 512'''

 ''C shell''
 $ '''limit openfiles 512'''

=== Shell Parameters ===
The shell's  environment can be accessed through its parameters. There are three types of parameter:

* named parameters
* positional parameters
* special parameters

Named parameters are known as environment variables. Some of these variables are
initialised when the user logs in and which the shell uses to determines its
behavior. The shell also maintains certain variables throughout the login session,
some of which are defined by the shell and are given special meaning, while
others can be user defined.

Positional parameters enable reference to arguments supplied to shell scripts.
The shell communicates process information through special parameters. Special
parameters can be accessed by the user, but unlike named and positional parameters,
they can only be set by the shell itself.

Environment variables are named parameters. Variables are assigned using the
command line statement in the form ''name=value''. Variable names
are  alphanumeric strings, they can contain numeric characters or underscores but
must begin with an alphabetic character. Four examples are presented below:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ n=2 
$ n2=4
$ N=3
$ MYNAME=alan 
$ greeting=&quot;hello world&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that Unix is case sensitive, so the variable &quot;name&quot; is not the same
as &quot;Name&quot;. A variable can be expanded (evaluated) by preceding the variable
name with a $, for example:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $greeting
hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;

Variables can be concatenated:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ day=21 month=01 year=2006
$ echo $day$month$year
21012006
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, there can be problem with concatenating literals with variables, using
variables for the day and month but hard-coding the year gives
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $day$month2006
05
&lt;/pre&gt;
The problem is that the shell cannot distinguish between the variable name 
''month'' and the literal value 2006. It therefore tries to expand a variable 
with the variable name ''month2006'', which is not set. 
This can be rectified by surrounding the variables names with braces {}, 
for example:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${day}${month}2006
05112006
&lt;/pre&gt;

Although the braces are not always necessary it is good practice to use
them when evaluating variables.

=== Quoting ===
Consider the following example, where the variable expansion phrase is enclosed
in double quotes:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo &quot;echo $greeting&quot;, displays $greeting
echo hello world, displays hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;

Variables enclosed in double quotes are still expanded by the shell. To prevent
expansion, variables should be enclosed in single quotes. To display the string
&quot;echo $greeting&quot; verbatim, use the statement:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ’echo $greeting’, displays $greeting
echo $greeting, displays hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== More Parameter Expansion ===

The shell supports quite sophisticated parameter expansion. The construct
&lt;tt&gt;NAME-literal&lt;/tt&gt; expands to the value of the parameter if it is set, otherwise
it expands to literal value. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${OPSYS-unix}    
unix
&lt;/pre&gt;

The variable ''OPSYS'' has not been assigned a value so the result of the command is to
echo the string &quot;unix&quot; to the screen. If the variable is assigned a value:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ OPSYS=Linux
$ echo ${OPSYS-unix}
Linux
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the variable is set to NULL, a blank link is displayed rather than the literal value:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ OPSYS=&quot;&quot;        
$ echo ${OPSYS-unix}  
(blank line)
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, if we use ''name:-literal'', the variable evaluates to the
literal rather than its NULL value:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${OPSYS:-unix}
unix
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using the construct ''name=literal'' the parameter is assigned the value of the
literal if it has not been set. Suppose that the variable DAY has not been
previously set:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $DAY
(blank line)
&lt;/pre&gt;

then the command line below will assign the string &quot;tuesday&quot; to the variable ''DAY'' 
and echo it to screen:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${DAY=tuesday}
tuesday
&lt;/pre&gt;

The variable ''DAY'' has now been set, so if the command line is repeated 
with a different literal value its value remains unchanged

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${DAY=wednesday}
tuesday
&lt;/pre&gt;

If ''DAY'' is assigned a NULL value, the following parameter expansion results
in a NULL value being returned:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ DAY=&quot;&quot;
$ echo ${DAY=tuesday}
(blank line)
&lt;/pre&gt;

An associated expansion construct is ''name-value'', which only returns the literal
if the parameter is unassigned, it returns the assigned value even if the value is
NULL.

Using the expansion construct ''name:=literal'' the parameter is assigned the value of
the literal if it has not been set. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $DISTRO               # DISTRO not assigned
echo ${DISTRO:=ubuntu}
ubuntu
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also, the literal is assigned if the parameter is NULL, the expansion is therefore:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ DISTRO=&quot;&quot;
$ echo ${DISTO:=ubuntu}
ubuntu
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the parameter is set to a non-NULL value then the literal is not assigned:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${DISTRO:=debian}
ubuntu
&lt;/pre&gt;

The expansion construct ''name=value'' is similar to ''name:=value'', 
however the literal is only assigned if the parameter was formerly 
unassigned. The literal is not assigned if the parameter value is NULL.
Using the ''name:?messagestring'' construct, an error message can be displayed if
parameter is unset or NULL:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${DISTVER:?distribution version unknown}
-bash: DISTVER: distribution version unknown
$ DISTVER=&quot;&quot;
$ echo ${DISTVER:?distribution version unknown}
-bash: DISTVER: distribution version unknown
&lt;/pre&gt;

The ''error'' message is not displayed if the parameter is assigned a non-NULL
value:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ DISTVER=&quot;hoary hedgehog&quot;
$ echo ${DISTVER:?distribution version not set}
hoary hedgehog
&lt;/pre&gt;

Likewise, there is an associated construct ''name?messagestring'' which 
returns the message string only if the parameter is unset.
Parameters can be expanded to substrings of their value. The expansion constructs
''name%pattern'' and ''name%%pattern'' expand to the largest and smallest substrings
to the left of the pattern respectively. For example, set the variable ''TIME'':

&lt;pre&gt;
$ TIME=10:29:39
&lt;/pre&gt;

The command line below displays only the hour value:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo the hours is ${TIME%%:*}
the hours is 10
&lt;/pre&gt;

whereas the following the command line display the hours and minutes
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo the hour and minutes are ${TIME%:*}
the hour and minutes are 10:29
&lt;/pre&gt;
The constructs ''name#pattern'' and ''name##pattern'' expand to the 
largest and smallest substring to the right of the pattern respectively. 
So the command line below expands to the seconds:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo the seconds are ${TIME##*:}
the seconds are 39
&lt;/pre&gt;

The minutes and seconds can be extracted with:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo the minutes and seconds are ${TIME#*:}
the minutes and seconds are 29:39
&lt;/pre&gt;

The length of a string can be evaluated with the ''#name'' construct. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${#TIME}
8
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Arrays ===
Variables can be one-dimensional arrays and are referenced in the form name[index].
Arrays can be assigned using the ''name=(value1 value2 ... )'' construct, 
so for example:

&lt;pre&gt;
DATE=($(date))
&lt;/pre&gt;

''$(command)'' expands to the result of ''command'' on the command line.
So ''DATE'' is assigned output of the command '''date''', where each space separated
string is assigned to an element in the array. So if we only want the year, then we
expand the sixth element of the array:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${DATE[5]}
2006
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can change, say the time information with the assignment:
&lt;pre&gt;
DATE[3]=19:16:00
$ echo ${DATE[*]}
Wed May 17 19:16:00 NZST 2006
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we need to count the number or assigned array elements, then we use the 
expression:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${#DATE[*]}
6
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Positional Parameters ===
Positional parameters provide a means of accessing arguments to shell scripts.
They are referenced by the numbers 1,2,3,... etc., where the numbers reflect the
order in which the arguments appeared on the command line (from left to right).
They cannot be assigned in the same way as named parameters, that is you cannot
do this: ''1=hello''. Positional parameters are assigned when a shell script is 
invoked with command line arguments. They can, however, be assigned with the set
command:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ set $(uname -rmv)
&lt;/pre&gt;

This causes the space separated strings from the output of ''uname -rmv'' to be 
assigned to the positional parameters. The statement below shows the values of all
positional parameters that were assigned:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${*}
2.6.14.4 #1 SMP Thu Dec 22 01:04:35 NZDT 2005 x86_64
&lt;/pre&gt;

And this statement gives the number of assigned positional parameters 
(equivalent to argc in C and C++):
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $#
10
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we specifically want the kernel version then we expand positional parameter 1:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $1
2.6.14.4
&lt;/pre&gt;
Double digit positional parameters need to be enclosed in braces. So 
if we want the architecture of the machine, we cannot do this:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $10
2.6.14.40
&lt;/pre&gt;
The expression above is expanded to positional parameter 1 followed by a literal 0.
The correct way is:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${10}
x86_64
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, positional parameter 0 is set to the name of the current process 
(equivalent to argv[0], which in this case should be the name of the shell 
command itself:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $0
-bash
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Special Parameters ===

Special parameters can be accessed by the user but can only be assigned (directly)
by the shell - typically in response to some event. We have already encountered the
parameters * and # which are set when a command is invoked with arguments (or
the set command is used).

The ? parameter expands to the return code of the process that last exited. If we
enclose a command line statement in brackets it is executed in a subshell. The
command line below forks a new shell and immediately issues exit. The argument
following exit is the value of the subshell’s return code (255 in this case):

&lt;pre&gt;
$ (exit 255)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The return code of the child process can be accessed by the parent by the expansion
of ?. If a process terminated normally then the return code is likely to be zero. If
however, the process terminated due to some error condition, it is useful if process
sets a non-zero return code so that the parent can determine the reason for the
termination:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $?
255
&lt;/pre&gt;

The process ID of the shell is stored in $. The ps command shows that the process
ID of my shell is 10005, which is what is given by the expansion of $:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ps | grep bash
10005 pts/77            00:00:00 bash
$ echo $$
10005
&lt;/pre&gt;

The ! parameter evaluates to the process ID of the last background process. To
demonstrate, the statement below invokes the sleep command (which sleeps for 60
seconds) in the background:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sleep 60 &amp;
[1] 24835
&lt;/pre&gt;

The process ID of the background process is displayed on the screen (in this case
24835). Expansion of the ! parameter confirms this:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $!
24835
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Exporting Parameters ===
Processes do not inherit environment variables from their parent unless the 
variables are exported. The command line below displays the process ID of 
the current process followed by the value of greeting (which was assigned 
earlier):

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${greeting?parameter not set}
hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we start a new shell and issue the command again we see that greeting is not set
in the child process:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ bash
$ echo ${greeting?parameter not set}
bash: greeting: parameter not set
&lt;/pre&gt;
Terminate the current shell process and return to the parent, then export greeting:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ exit
$ export greeting
&lt;/pre&gt;
You can confirm that a variable has the export attribute set by typing:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ export | grep greeting
declare -x greeting=&quot;hello world&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now start a new shell again and evaluate greeting:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ bash
$ echo ${greeting?parameter not set}
hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;
The new shell has inherited the variable greeting and can evaluate it. 
A variable retains its export attribute (until the shell is terminated) even 
if it is reassigned, but it can be removed using the typeset command:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ typeset +x greeting
$ export | grep greeting     # yields no result
&lt;/pre&gt;
In Bash (and Kornshell, but not Bourne shell), a variable can be assigned and 
exported in one command line statement:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ export greeting=&quot;hi there&quot;
$ export | grep greeting
declare -x greeting=&quot;hi there&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Read on to learn about simple CELX scripting...

If you have comments or questions, please put them on the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/Q&amp;A|Celx Questions and Answers]] page.

==Introduction==
This is a tutorial on simple CELX scripting. It is based on the philosophy that the best way to learn is by example, so there are lots of examples. Each example is usually a small step beyond the previous one, but understanding it may depend on ''any'' previous example, so make sure you understand each example completely before you go on to the next.

==Getting Started==
To get started, you should create a script file for testing purposes. You could call it &quot;test.celx&quot; or something similar. Be sure it has the &quot;.celx&quot; file type suffix so it will be recognized as a Celestia CELX script file. Then you should be able to just double-click on the file icon to cause Celestia to run the script. This is a lot faster than running the script from the Celestia menus. You can keep both Celestia and your text editor running; when you're ready to test your script just save your changes and double-click the file icon. The Celestia window should pop to the front and run your script. After you've observed the result you can return to the editor window to make further changes in the script. And don't overlook the fact that you can cut and paste code directly from the tutorial examples!

==Starting Simple==
Here's a simple CELX script:

&lt;code&gt;celestia:flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
wait(2.0)&lt;/code&gt;

When you run this script, the message &quot;Hello, Universe!&quot; will briefly appear in the lower left corner of the Celestia window. The script instructions here are very simple. First, we asked the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;flash&quot; to display the message  &quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;. Then we asked the script to wait for 2 seconds (so we'd have time to see the message).

The format of our request to the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;flash&quot; is basic to Lua. First we wrote the name of the object, in this case, &quot;celestia&quot;. Then we wrote a colon (:) to indicate that we were requesting the object to perform a function. Then we wrote the name of the function we want the object to perform, in this case, &quot;flash&quot;. Finally, we wrote the parameters to the function, in this case the string &quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;, enclosed in parentheses. (Note that we didn't use quotes around the name of the object or the function, just the parameter.) Other requests to objects to perform a function have a similar format.

Here's another example:

&lt;code&gt;
celestia:flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
wait(2.0)&lt;br&gt;
celestia:flash(&quot;Goodbye, Universe!&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
wait(2.0)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

In this example we've made two requests to the object named &quot;celestia&quot;. Both requests asked the object to perform the same function (the one named &quot;flash&quot;), but we specified different message strings as the parameter to the function in each, causing the object to evaluate the function differently in each case, displaying a different message.

==A Simple Function==
Now let's write our own function:
&lt;tt&gt;
 function flash(message)
    celestia:flash(message)
    wait(2.0)
 end
 
 flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)
 flash(&quot;Goodbye, Universe!&quot;)
&lt;/tt&gt;
In this example we defined our own &quot;flash&quot; function, to include the 2 second wait. Then we asked  the script to perform our new function twice, using a different string each time.

Our new function is named &quot;flash&quot;, but it's different from the function of that name which belongs to the object named &quot;celestia&quot;. Instead, the new function belongs to our script. When we ask the script to perform our &quot;flash&quot; function, we don't need to write the name of an object or a colon (:). We just write the name of the function, followed by the parameter enclosed in parentheses.

But note that when we defined our new function, we ''did'' use the object name and colon, because there we ''do'' want to ask the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;flash&quot;.

The format of a function definition is another Lua basic. First we write the keyword &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt;. Then we write the name of the function, in this case &quot;flash&quot;. Then we write the name of the parameter, enclosed in parentheses. In this case, the parameter is named &quot;message&quot;.  Then we write the sequence of instructions that the script will follow to perform the function. Finally, at the end of the function, we write the keyword &lt;tt&gt;end&lt;/tt&gt;. (Note that we didn't use quotes around the name of the function or its parameter. We only need quotes for literal strings, not for names.)

In this case, the instructions needed to perform our function are to ask the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;flash&quot; using our function's parameter named &quot;message&quot; as the parameter to the object's function. Then we asked the script to wait for 2 seconds.

Note that first we ''defined'' our function, then we ''called'' it (twice). (When we say &quot;called&quot;, we mean that we asked the script to perform the function.)  When we ''defined'' the function, we named its parameter &quot;message&quot;. And we referred to that name in the instructions we used to specify how the function will be performed. Then each time we ''called'' the function, we specified a particular string to be the &quot;message&quot; which the script used when performing  the function.

But you can also uses names rather  than actual strings in a function call, as in the following example
&lt;tt&gt;
 function flash(message)
    celestia:flash(message)
    wait(2.0)
 end
 
 flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)
 farewell = &quot;Goodbye, Universe!&quot;
 flash( farewell)
&lt;/tt&gt;
In this example, we first gave the name &quot;farewell&quot; to the string &quot;Goodbye, Universe!&quot;. Then we asked the script to perform our &quot;flash&quot; function using that name, rather than the string itself.
The syntax of the instruction by which we gave the name to the string is another Lua basic. It consists of the name, in this case &quot;farewell&quot;,  followed by an equals sign (=) to indicate that we're assigning the name to what follows, followed by the actual string. The association of a name with a value in this way is called a variable assignment. The reason it's called a variable is that we can later assign the same name to a different value if we choose to. We can also assign a different name to the value. In that case, the value has more than one name.
(The parameter name in our function definition is not a variable, strictly speaking, but works very much like one.)

By the way, there's another, slightly different format for function definitions, which we'll use in the next example:
&lt;tt&gt;
 flash =  function (message)
              celestia:flash(message)
              wait(2.0)
             end
 
 flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)
 farewell = &quot;Goodbye, Universe!&quot;
 flash( farewell)
&lt;/tt&gt;
In the format we've used in this example, the name of  the function doesn't come after the &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. Instead it comes first, followed by an equals sign (=). Next comes the &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt; keyword, followed directly by parameter enclosed in parentheses. Then comes the sequence of instructions that define  the function, ending with the &lt;tt&gt;end&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. The only difference from the way we defined  the function previously is the position of the function name, and the addition of the equals sign.

If this new format for a  function definition looks a lot like a variable assignment, it's no coincidence: that's exactly what it is. We're simply giving a name to a function, just the way we gave a name to a string in the previous example. We will return to the very important implications of this fact later on. Note that it doesn't matter which format you use. Their meaning is identical. 

From this point on, for the sake of brevity, our examples will assume that we've already defined our flash function as in one of the previous examples.

==More Examples==
Now let's try using another function provided by the object named &quot;celestia&quot;:
&lt;tt&gt;
 time = celestia:gettime()
 flash(time)
&lt;/tt&gt;
In this example, we asked the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;gettime&quot;, and we gave the name &quot;time&quot; to the result (a number) that the object returned to us. Then we asked script to perform our &quot;flash&quot; function, using the number named &quot;time&quot; as the &quot;message&quot; parameter.

No parameters were needed for the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;gettime&quot;, so the parentheses following the function name are empty.

The syntax of the instruction by which we gave the name to the result of this function request is another Lua basic. It consists of the name, in this case &quot;time&quot;,  followed by an equals sign (=) to indicate that we're assigning the name to what follows, followed by the request to the object to perform the function (and return its result).

When you run this script, you'll see a large number briefly displayed. This number is the current time setting in Celestia, expressed as a Julian date. (it's the number of days since the beginning of the Julian epoch).

In the next example, we'll make this clear:
&lt;tt&gt;
 time = celestia:gettime()
 timeMessage = &quot;The current time is &quot; .. time .. &quot; (Julian date).&quot;
 flash(timeMessage)
&lt;/tt&gt;

==More To Come...==
'''WARNING''': Construction area ahead! Proceed at your own risk! 
----
In the next example, we'll convert this to a more recognizable form:

Fortunately, the &lt;tt&gt;celestia&lt;/tt&gt; object has a function to help us do that:
&lt;tt&gt;
 jdate = celestia:gettime()
 flash(jdate)
 date = celestia:fromjulianday(jdate)
 flash(date.year)
&lt;/tt&gt;

In this example, we asked the &lt;tt&gt;celestia&lt;/tt&gt; object to give us the time, then asked it to give us the result of converting that Julian date to a calendar date, and finally asked the script to use our &quot;flash function&quot; to display the part of the date that indicates the year.

To display the full date, we'll need to join the parts of the date for the year, month and day: 
&lt;tt&gt;
 jdate = celestia:gettime()
 flash(jdate)
 date = celestia:fromjulianday(jdate)
 dateString = date.year..&quot;/&quot;..date.month..&quot;/&quot;..date.day
 flash(dateString)
&lt;/tt&gt;
The following additional examples await explanation. In the meantime, you're  invited to see if you can figure them out on your own!
&lt;tt&gt;
  saturn = celestia:find(&quot;Saturn&quot;) -- finds object named Saturn
  radius = saturn:radius() -- gets radius of Saturn
  flash(&quot;The radius of Saturn is &quot;..radius..&quot; km.&quot;)
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  flashRadius = function (bodyName)
                           body = celestia:find(bodyName) -- finds object 
                           radius = body:radius() -- gets radius
                           flash(&quot;The radius of &quot; .. body:name() .. &quot; is &quot; .. radius .. &quot; km.&quot;)
                        end
       
  flashRadius(&quot;Jupiter&quot;)
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  jupiter = &quot;Jupiter&quot;
  flashRadius(jupiter)
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  reallyBigPlanet = &quot;Jupiter&quot;
  flashRadius(reallyBigPlanet)
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  selectedPlanet = celestia:getselection() -- gets the planet currently selected by the user
  flashRadius(selectedPlanet:name())
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  flashRadius = function (body)
                          if type(body) == &quot;string&quot; then
                              body = celestia:find(body) -- finds object 
                          end
                          radius = body:radius() -- gets radius
                          flash(&quot;The radius of &quot; .. body:name() .. &quot; is &quot; .. radius .. &quot; km.&quot;)
                        end
  selectedPlanet = celestia:getselection()
  flashRadius(selectedPlanet)
&lt;/tt&gt;
In this example, we've defined a function to flash a message reporting the radius of a specified planet. Then we called the function twice, to display the radius of two different planets. This should all look familiar to you from previous examples. (In future examples, you should assume our flashRadius function is already defined.) In the next example, we'll do the same thing just a bit differently:
&lt;tt&gt;
  planetList = { &quot;Uranus&quot;, &quot;Neptune&quot; }
  flashRadius(planetList[1])
  flashRadius(planetList[2])
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  planetList = { &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;Mars&quot; }
  for index = 1,3 do
     flashRadius(planetList[index])
  end
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  planetList = { &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;Mars&quot;,  &quot;Venus&quot;,  &quot;Mercury&quot; }
  for index,name in ipairs(planetList) do
     flashRadius(name)
  end
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
 selectedObject = celestia:getselection()
 flashRadius(selectedObject:name())
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
 cassini = celestia:find(&quot;Cassini&quot;) -- finds object named Cassini
 saturn = celestia:find(&quot;Saturn&quot;) -- finds object named Saturn
 cassiniPosition = cassini:getposition() -- gets position of Cassini
 saturnPosition = saturn:getposition() -- gets position of Saturn
 distance = cassiniPosition:distanceto(saturnPosition) -- gets distance from  position of Cassini to that of Saturn
 distance = distance-saturn:radius() -- adjusts for distance to surface
 flash(&quot;Current distance from Cassini to Saturn's surface is &quot;..distance)
&lt;/tt&gt;
This one is a little more fun:
&lt;tt&gt;
 -- tour the moons of Saturn
  obs = celestia:getobserver()
  planet = celestia:find(&quot;Saturn&quot;)
  obs:goto(planet)
  wait(5)
  flash(&quot;Welcome to &quot;..planet:name())
  moons = planet:getchildren()
  for index,body in ipairs(moons) do
     if body:type() == &quot;moon&quot; then
         obs:follow(body)
         obs:goto(body)
         wait(5)
         flash(&quot;Welcome to &quot;..body:name())
         wait(1)
     end
   end 
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
 -- tour the stars at random
 obs = celestia:getobserver() 
 stars = celestia:getstarcount() 
 for i = 1,stars do 
    j = math.random(stars) 
    obj = celestia:getstar(j) 
    obs:goto(obj,20) 
    while obs:travelling() do wait(0.5) end 
    celestia:flash(&quot;Welcome to &quot;..obj:name(),2) 
  end 
&lt;/tt&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Use the Source}}

There are many factions within the world of open source, these include the Free Software and the Open Source pundits, the GPL and the BSD supporters, the libertarians and the communists.

These factions all have different reasons for the things they do and the things they don't; for some it is a matter of what is a right and what is practical, for others it is being altruistic to all people and for others it is getting the most out of a situation.

Briefly we shall sum up these groups:

The Free Software Foundation/GNU movement is a socio-political group for whom non-Free software is a social problem and Free Software is the solution.

The Open Source Inititive is a development methodology, to them non-Open Source software is a sub-par solution.

The BSDers (gotta get a better title than that) are a volunteer altruist group who give their work away for everyone.  So everyone can get better.  To them non-BSD code is irrelevant, it can be used and can be learnt from, but does not involved them.

The GPLers (still going to need another name) are volunteers who seek to recieve reimbursement for their contributions.  Getting back what others make of their work.  To them non-GPL code is code which will die, that without the GPL license to protect the code it will not be able to maintain its competitive edge against proprietary software.

Outside of these groups, most people view them singularly as either open source or free software, but within there is a fair bit of bitterness and conflict, because of the different reasons for their actions. They all hold different views on how things should be done. This creates an image of a discordant open source community, when, in fact, it is actually many smaller communities which have only loose ties to one another.

{{TODO|Make notes about how GPL supporters are not all supporters of the FSF.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would begin explaining the lisp essential, the original ideas from McCarthy and the implementations. The diferences and approachs between schemme lisp, common lisp and emacs lisp is interesting also. The most interesting is explain the lisp primitives with case of use in the real life. This would be a interesting approach about a book of lisp. 

We can drag and drop a lot of interesting text about introduction, history, etc. from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language.</text>

==Introduction==


{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;All great literature addresses directly or indirectly two questions: ''What kind of world is this?'' and ''How should we live in it?''&quot;|caption=--Christopher Clausen}}



Writing in the humanities includes posing questions dealing with human values.  The ultimate goal in writing in the humanities is to explain/share the human experience, to use writing as a tool to reflect upon life, and to tell how life should, or should not, be lived. &quot;Humanities&quot; as a discipline includes not only literature, but also philosophy, ethics,  performing arts, fine arts, history, aspects of anthropology and cultural studies, foreign languages, linguistics, jurisprudence, political science, and sociology. In a humanities class, you might be asked to attempt the analysis of a poem, a performance or a play, a painting, a film or even a musical performance.

There is often a difference in feel between writing in the Sciences and writing in the Humanities.  Writing in the Sciences is often convergent (meaning oriented toward finding or articulating a specific answer to a specific question).  Writing in the Humanities is often divergent (meaning oriented toward exploration of multiple answers to multiple questions).

== Categories of Humanities Writing ==
Writing in the Humanities falls into three categories: theoretical writing, creative writing, and interpretive and analytical writing.  Term papers and research papers are included in this discipline of writing when their topics pertain to the field of humanities.

=== Theoretical Writing ===
Theoretical writing involves writing on a topic from a theoretical perspective.  In physics, for example, there is a theory on how the galaxy operates called the &quot;string theory.&quot;  A physics paper centered around the string theory would be considered a theoretical paper.

=== Creative Writing ===
Creative writing attempts to achieve, or create, an affect in the minds of the readers.  The intended affect differs depending on the goals of the writer.  The intention may be to expound on the grieving process (catharsis), or to make a person laugh or cry.  The potential results are unlimited.  Creative writing can also be used as an outlet for people to get their thoughts and feelings out and onto paper.  Many people enjoy creative writing but prefer not to share it.  Creative writing can take place in a variety of forms.  Poems, short stories, novels, and even song lyrics are all examples of creative writing.  Viewpoints regarding what exactly is encompassed under the term ''creative writing'' differ.  To some, non-fiction can be considered creative writing because it is done from the author's point of view and may be written in an individual style that engages the reader. In fact, many universities offer courses in &quot;Creative non-fiction.&quot; Others like to separate non-fiction from creative writing because it deals with details that actually took place, even if viewed subjectively.  Regardless, the outlook of the writer is what matters, and whether something is considered creative writing or not is less important than producing a product that you can be proud of.

'''Narrator'''

A narrator is the voice or person who tells the story. One must never assume that a narrator of a story is related to the author in any way. Even if we, as an audience, are aware that the author of the story once had a similar experience to that of the narrator, we cannot make assumptions that there is any truth to the text. When writing or discussing criticism, the intent of the author is also off limits because regardless of the author intent, the value of a text is determined by reader response alone. An example of an author having a similar experience to the narrator of a story she'd written, is Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story ''The Yellow Wallpaper.'' Because the author had released statements revealing that she'd had a smilar medical treatment in her life to the narrator of her story, we still cannot assume that the narrator and Gilman are one in the same person.

A '''First-Person''' narrator is when one person narrates the story. Thus, a reader will recognize a first-person narrator because the pro-nouns &quot;I&quot; and &quot;my&quot; will be used. Because the story is narrated by one person, we are limited to the thoughts and observations of that person. There are many reasons that an author may choose to use a first-person narrator, but the reason is mainly to demonstrate the changes within one particular character, and also to build suspense. For example, if an author were to suddenly swith a first-person myself novel to a third-person narrator, the &quot;who-done-it&quot; aspect of the story would be ruined because we would suddenly be able to dive into the minds of multiple characters.

There is also '''Third-person limited''' and '''Third-person omniscient.''' Third-person limited is when the narrator is limited to the thoughts of one particular character, but there is a little more freedom than with a first-person narrator because the narrator can more easily observe the behavior of others. Finally, a third-person omniscient narrator is when the lens of the storyteller is pulled back even further, but we are able to dive into the minds of any and all characters. Therefore, a third-person omniscient narrater is rather God-like in that it enables us to know absolutely anything and everything that is happening in the novel. This may sound like the most enjoyable way to compose, but as stated earlier, there are drawbacks to this kind of narrator in that it may be harder to create an element of surprise for the reader.

'''Literary Periods'''

''Deconstructionism'' is an approach to literature which suggests that literary works do not yield a single, fixed meaning because we can never say what we truly mean in language.

''Early Modern Era'' Period extending from about 1500 to 1800, marked by the advent of colonialism and capitalism.

''Modernism'' Writing and art roughly made in at the start of WWI (1914) through the end of WWII (1945).

''Postmodernism'' is a literary and artistic movement that flourished in the late twentieth century, partly in response to Modernism. A common theme in this kind of work is self-reflexiveness.

=== Interpretive and Analytical Writing ===

==== Interpretive Writing ==== 

* An interpretation involves the discovery of meaning in a text (or film or painting, etc.) or the production of meaning in the process of reading a text.  Therefore, interpretive writing must address many questions.  It tries to assist the reader in understanding specific events (literary, cultural, or otherwise) rather than just engaging in summary.  For example, a student writing an interpretive paper about a specific book may try to explain the author's attitudes or views on a specific subject matter.  The writer of the paper then uses the evidence found in that book to back up his or her claims.   A poor example of interpretive writing is a book report.  A good example of interpretive writing is a scholarly article about another text.   

Writing might ask questions such as, &quot;Why did these events happen?&quot; or &quot;What was the significance of these events to the author or main character?&quot; as opposed to, &quot;What happened&quot; or &quot;How did these events come about?&quot;  The former questions encourage writers to explore their own thoughts or to delve into the mind of the writer of the text, or even attempt to put himself in the shoes of the protagonist.  The latter is less challenging, as the book or piece of literature will plainly lay this type of information out for the reader.

==== Analytical Writing ====

* Analytical writing examines the components of a text.  Writers of analytical essays or articles consider information, break it apart, and reconstruct it in order to describe the information so another reader can make sense of it.   Writers must make sense of a work before they can begin to describe its constituent parts.

* Analytical writing focuses on the words &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why.&quot; A writer often uses each of these two terms to give proof of their current analogies. By using these strong terms, a reader can feel that the writer is confident in their work and know &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; they should react.  

* Analytical writing happens in four steps.  The ''first'' step is to clearly identify the problem, the question, or the issue.  The ''second'' step is to define the issue.  The ''third'' step is the actual analysis of the topic.  Finally, the ''fourth'' step defines the relationship between the issue and the analysis of that issue.

==== Analyzing and Interpreting Literature ====

* There is a lot of overlap in the processes of analysis and interpretation, especially when writing about literature.  Writing about literature (poems, short stories, plays, etcs) often involves making an argument that can be backed up with specific examples from the text.  When interpreting a poem the writer should expect that they will have to include specific references to the lines, words, or phrases to which they are referring.  A writer analyzing the main character in ''The Great Gatsby'' should include specific references that explain why they have reached a particular conclusion.  

* An essay dealing with literature should not be a summary of the text.  It doesn't always hurt to give a few background examples, but the writer should focus on talking about the portions of the text that emphasize their points, not summarizing the entire piece for the reader.  If the reader isn't familiar with the primary text, they can go back and read it themselves.  The interpreter's job isn't to recap, but to make an argument, and hopefully provide some sort of illumination of the work.

* A piece of literature should always be referred to in the present tense.  

* Take a look at this sample essay on the play ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=&lt;center&gt;'''Fairies, Duality, and Conflict'''&lt;/center&gt;

	It’s hard to read A Midsummer Night’s Dream without noticing at least some duality within the play.  While it’s relatively easy to spot in the “lamentable comedy” performed by the mechanicals, there are also more nuanced examples that are introduced in Act 2, Scene 1.  This scene reveals some of the play’s duality, specifically in regards to the fairies, as it continues to build on Act 1’s theme of conflict between lovers.


The start of this scene opens with Puck talking with another fairy.  This is the first appearance of any fairies and it adds a fantasy, or dream-like, element to the play.  The unnamed fairy announces that, “I serve the Fairy Queen, / To dew her orb upon the green” (2.1.8-9).  This fits the idea that many people have of fairies; they are pleasant folk associated with nature.  Nothing about this fairy is threatening or even mischievous.  This is directly at odds with the character of Puck.  Puck spends his time pretending to be footstools that women can sit on, “Then I slip from her bum, down topples she, / And ‘Tailor’ cries, and falls into a cough” (2.1.53-54).  He “frights the maidens of the villagery” (2.1.35) and does things like, “mislead might wanderers, laughing at their harm?”  (2.1.39).  While the unnamed fairy is out spreading dew upon blades of grass, Puck is out spreading mischief.  The unnamed fairy represents the good within fairy-kind, while Puck represents the potentially threatening.  An examination of Puck’s name adds to this.  According to the unnamed fairy, Puck is also known as Robin Goodfellow (2.1.34); but, he doesn’t go by that name, he goes by Puck.  If Puck were a more good-natured fairy, he might prefer to go by the name Robin Goodfellow.  However, his decision to play a darker role than the other fairies mirrors his decision to go by a less pleasant sounding moniker.  Puck is more of an imp than a fairy.  He has a trickster mentality that isn’t present in the other fairies. 


Puck and the unnamed fairy are representative of two larger factions, which are each headed by a more powerful fairy.  At the beginning of the scene the unnamed fairy says she serves the fairy queen, and Puck later reveals who he serves by saying, “I jest to Oberon and make him smile” (2.1.44).  Later in this scene Oberon will ask Puck to run an errand for him, and the sensitivity of the errand suggests that Oberon wouldn’t trust just anyone with it.  In addition to being Oberon’s jester, Puck is also his confidant.  


Oberon’s entrance into the scene matches the more threatening demeanor that Puck embodies.  Puck notes that, “Oberon is passing fell and wrath, / Because that she as her attendant hath / A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king” (2.1.20-22).  Oberon and all he represents is at odds with Titania and all that she represents.  Oberon and Titania’s conflict is in addition to the other conflicts in the play between couples:  Theseus and Hippolyta and the Lysander/Hermia/Demetrius/Helena quartet.  It’s also fitting that Oberon and Titania are arguing over a human boy.  The human world has created conflict in the fairy world, just as the fairy world will later on intensify the conflict of the human world of the four lovers.

 
Oberon and Titania are shown in this scene as having emotions like any ordinary human.  This reinforces the bond between the two worlds in the play; the world of fantasy and the more concrete world that the humans live in.  Oberon and Titania both have other lovers.  Titania notes that Oberon has been spending time with Phillida and Hippolyta (2.1.66-71), while Oberon counters that Hippolyta has been intimate with Theseus (2.1.76-80).  They argue over infidelity like any humans would in a similar relationship.  The fact that they both appear to have cheated on one another may not entirely add up since Titania appears to represent a kinder, gentler fairy demographic, as opposed to Oberon’s more threatening one.  But Titania says why she cheated.  She calls her infidelities, “the forgeries of jealousy” (2.1.81).  Titania is arguing that she only cheated because Oberon drove her to it.  Perhaps, she needed more attention than Oberon was willing to give.  Perhaps, she was trying to hurt Oberon like he had hurt her.  These are very human reactions and impulses.


Yet, these are not mere humans, but fairies:  not just fairies, but fairy royalty.  Because of this wrinkle, their actions, and their discord, has a marked effect on the world around them.  Once Oberon started cheating on Titania, 
          The winds, piping to us in vain,
          As in revenge, have sucked up from the sea
          Contagious fogs which, falling in the land,
          Hath every pelting river made so proud
          That they have overborne their continents.  (2.1.88-92)
In addition to the floods there are also droughts, famine and a host of other issues (2.1.93-114).  The relationship of these two is clearly the reason for the disturbance in nature.  This is shown when Titania says, “And this same progeny of evils comes / from our debate, from our dissension. / We are their parents and original” (2.1.115-117).  The trouble that has overtaken the natural world is at odds with the preparations concerning the festival that are taking place within Athens.  Much as the forest world is a different place than the stone walls of Athens.  Yet, despite their differences, nature and the 
civilized world will interact.  It’s impossible to keep them completely apart despite their separate natures.


It’s also worth noting how the relationship between Oberon and Titania was prior to their discord, 
          Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
          By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
          Or in the beached margent of the sea,
          To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind.  (2.1.83-86)
They were like two young lovers, who met everywhere and couldn’t get enough of each other before Oberon ruins things.  Titania says to him, “But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport” (2.1.87).  Certainly, many relationships encounter problems after an initial period of bliss; but, it should also be noted that abusive people often appear to be sweet and caring before their true colors show.  Oberon may just be that cruel.  He only wants the Indian boy because Titania has him; perhaps, specifically because Titania loves him.  After all, Oberon wants the boy to be a, “Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild” (2.1.25).  As the fairy king Oberon must have plenty of others whom he could get to fill that type of position.  Titania, on the other hand, genuinely cares for him.  We know this because she, “Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy” (2.1.27).  Oberon can’t quite comprehend why Titania shouldn’t do what he says and he says so, “Why should Titania cross her Oberon?”  (2.1.119).  Because Oberon can’t comprehend why Titania would cross him, he sends Puck to get him a juice that will allow him to force Titania into submission (2.1.169-174).  Oberon’s unwillingness to allow Titania’s free spirit to go unpunished is a perfect example of the cruel and threatening demeanor of his.  The element of fantasy that the fairies add can be dreamlike, but dreams can become nightmares, and Oberon is a darker personality to counter Titania’s light.


This scene also has Demetrius and Helena in it, and provides us great insight into their characters.  Demetrius is brushing off Helena and she says,
          I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
          The more you beat me I will fawn on you.
          Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
          Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
          Unworthy as I am, to follow you.  (2.1.203-207)
This works on a variety of levels.  For one, it brings into the play a darker, more masochistic, idea of love that is at odds with the pure notion of love that the audience may assume that Lysander and Hermia share.  It also reveals Helena as a woman who acts the opposite of Titania.  Titania handles her abusive relationship by seeking love in another’s arms, by spending time with the people who care for her, and by devoting her time to a boy.  She separates herself from her abuser, Oberon, rather than seeking his company.  Hermia seeks the abuse out.  She views any attention, no matter how negative, as positive simply because it’s some sort of attention.  If Demetrius gave her positive attention, perhaps she wouldn’t be happy for long.  Demetrius, on the other hand, tells Helena that looking at her makes him sick (2.1.213).  He talks to her as if he hates her, and it takes a hard-heart to look so cruelly on someone so pathetic.  Oberon happens to witness the exchange between these two and he sends Puck to put Demetrius under the same spell that he wants Titania put under (2.1.259-266).  It’s this part of the scene that sets into motion the rest of the play, as Titania is put under the spell’s effects, and Puck inadvertently finds Lysander instead of Demetrius.


In addition to setting the stage for the action that will come afterward, this scene reveals much about the characters within it.  It introduces the fairies and their duality, and it builds up a darker aspect of the play through the continuation of conflict that acts to counteract some of the lightheartedness of the play.

|caption=Sample Essay}}

Here the writer has chosen to focus on one specific scene in the play, and how it fits their argument about the duality and conflict present within the play.  Notice that throughout the entire essay there are numerous examples from within the text.  Had the author not included these, or had they just summarized everything briefly, the essay wouldn't be as strong as it currently is.  Here the reader can see exactly what lines make the writer think the way they do.  Also, notice that the paper isn't a summary of what happens in the scene.  When the writer gives details about what happens in the scene, it is because these details relate directly to the topic of their paper.

=== Research Papers and Term Papers ===

Term papers have a variety of elements that make them stand out from other papers.  They carry three distinct characteristics.  First, there is a large amount of research that goes into a term paper.  The research contains various findings such as: facts, statistics, interviews, quotes, etc. Researching and gathering data must include understanding that information once it is compiled.  The second characteristic is the amount of preparation it takes in gathering, compiling, analyzing, and sorting through everything in order to create a draft of your data.  Finally, the third characteristic involves knowing the rules that must be followed when writing a specific term paper in the humanities discipline.  These rules will generally be conveyed by your instructor.

Writing the research paper involves a bit of detective work.  While there is much reading to be done on the chosen topic, reading is not the only pathway to gain information.  As a writer in the humanities, you can also conduct interviews, surveys, polls, and observation clinics.  You should research and discover as much information as you can about the given topic so you can form a coherent and valid opinion.

== Elements of the Humanities Paper==

Many styles of documentation are used when writing the humanities paper.  Choosing the style depends on the subject being addressed in the paper and the style your instructor may prefer you use.

When it comes down to actually writing your paper, be sure to include the following elements:  an introduction, a thesis statement, the body of the paper (which should include quotations, and, of course, the citations), and the conclusion.  

=== Introduction ===
Like most papers and essays, an introduction is absolutely necessary when writing in the humanities.  There can be some confusion as to which should come first; the introduction or the thesis statement.  This decision could probably be clarified by asking your instructor.  Many writers include the thesis statement in their introduction.  Generally speaking, however, the introduction usually comes before the thesis statement.

The introduction should grab your reader and make them interested in continuing to read your paper.  Ask a question, say something powerful, or say something controversial.  Be specific, not vague.  Say something interesting, not mundane.  Relay something the reader may not know, not something that is public knowledge.  The idea is to get the reader's attention, and keep it.

A good intro may go something like this: 

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;Imagine yourself walking out of class feeling refreshed and relaxed because your day is almost done. You race down the stairs and out the doors just to take in the amazing scent of fresh outside air when suddenly you smell something completely wretched. You notice something that resembles a small grey cloud coming out of a fellow student's mouth. Then your throat begins to feel clogged and just when you can't take it any longer, your lungs give in and you feel as if you can no longer breathe. You think to yourself, 'What's happening to me? Am I dying?' No, not exactly. Your lungs and the rest of your body have just been affected by what is commonly known as passive smoking, which is becoming one of the leading causes of death in the United States.&quot;|caption=}}

After the introduction has been written, you can then go into your thesis statement.  Many people regard the thesis statement as a continuation of the introduction, only in the next paragraph.

=== Thesis Statement ===
The thesis statement should come at the beginning of the paper.  It will introduce the reader to the topic you intend to address, and gives them a hint of what to expect in the pages that follow.  Thesis statements should avoid words and phrases such as, &quot;In my opinion...&quot; or &quot;I think that...&quot;  Start your thesis by taking a stand immediately; be firm in your statement, but not pushy.  You'll either be given your topic for your paper or you will choose it yourself.  In either case, after the topic is chosen, write a thesis statement that clearly outlines the argument you intend to address in the paper.  The thesis statement will be the center of your paper.  It should address one main issue.  Throughout the paper, whatever you write will be focused on the thesis statement.  As your paper develops, you may find you will want to, or need to, revise your thesis statement to better outline your paper.  As your paper evolves, so does your thesis.  In other words, when writing your thesis statement, keep your paper in mind, and when writing your paper, keep your thesis statement in mind.  Your paper will defend your thesis, so write your paper accordingly.

For example, if the topic is &quot;Analyzing Mark Twain's 'Huckleberry Finn,'&quot; your thesis statement might address the social implications or meanings behind the characters chosen for the story.  Keeping the thesis statement in mind, you would then write your paper about the characters in the story.  Let's say you are writing a philosophy paper.  Your thesis statement might include two opposing arguments, with the hint that you intend to argue or prove one side of the argument.  Many thesis statements are written in such a way as to try to prove an argument or point of view, but challenge yourself; make your thesis statement a statement of how you plan to ''disprove'' an argument.  Maybe you want to attempt to show your readers why a specific point of view does ''not'' work.

Your thesis statement should address one main issue.  It takes a point of view or an argument, and the paper is the development of this argument.  If your thesis statement is too simple, obvious, or vague, then you need to work on it a little more.  You should try to write it in a way that will catch your reader's attention, making it interesting and thought-provoking.  It should be specific in nature, and address the theme of the entire paper.  The thesis statement may be written to try to convince the reader of a specific issue or point of view.  It may also address an issue to which there is no simple solution or easy answers;  remember, make it thought-provoking.  Many thesis statements ''invite'' the reader to disagree.

Don't be alarmed if you find yourself midway through your paper and wanting to change your thesis statement.  This will happen.  Sometimes a writer will start out thinking they know ''exactly'' the point they want to make in their paper, only to find halfway through that they've taken a slightly different direction.  Don't be afraid to modify your thesis statement.  But a word of caution; if you modify your thesis statement, be sure to double check your paper to ensure that it is supported by the thesis.  If you have changed your thesis statement, it would be wise, even advisable, to have a third party read your paper to be sure that the paper supports the thesis and the revised thesis describes the paper.

=== Body ===
The &quot;body&quot; of your paper contains the &lt;i&gt;evidence, analysis,&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; reasoning&lt;/i&gt; that support your thesis.  Often the topic of the paper is divided into subtopics.  Typically, each subtopic is discussed in a separate paragraph, but there is nothing wrong with continuing a subtopic throughout multiple paragraphs.  It is good practice to begin each paragraph with a &lt;i&gt;topic sentence&lt;/i&gt; that introduces the subject of the new paragraph and helps transition between paragraphs.  A topic sentence will help keep you focused while writing the paragraph, and it will keep your reader focused while reading it.

=== Conclusion ===
The purpose of a conclusion is to &quot;wrap up&quot; the discussion of your paper.  Especially if the paper is a long one, it is a good idea to &quot;re-cap&quot; the main ideas presented in your paper.  If your paper is argumentative, you'd likely want to re-enforce the standpoint introduced in your thesis statement; however, rather than repeating your thesis, offer closing statements that make use of all the information you've presented to support your thesis.  Try to &quot;echo&quot; your thesis so that your reader understands that you have fulfilled the &quot;promise&quot; a thesis statement implies, but give your reader a sense of &lt;i&gt;closure&lt;/i&gt; rather than simply restating everything you said above just ending it.

Here are some strategies for closing your discussion:

''After summing up your main points/thesis you might''
* Comment on the significance of the topic in general:  why should your reader care?
* Look to the future:  Is there more work to be done on the topic?  Are there predictions you can make about your topic?
* Ask something of your reader:  Is there something your reader can do?  Should do?

=== Argumentative Research Papers ===

One of the main things that differentiates a college level research paper from research papers below the college level is they almost always will be argumentative; that is, they will be taking a stance.  The research is then used to back up the argument of the writer, or to put their argument into context.  Students new to college will often attempt to simply provide information that makes the research paper becoming stale and unnecessary.  If all the paper is doing is repackaging old information, why not just go back to the original source?  Papers that just provide information risk unintentional plagiarism.  If none of the information provided contains your own insights, then failing to cite everything means that it is plagiarized.  Yet, most students would be reluctant to cite the entirety of their paper.

=== Plagiarism ===

Plagiarism results from including non-trivial information (ideas, facts, etc) from another source without acknowledging its source.  Plagiarism is one of the most serious offenses that can be committed in academia and it involves varying degrees.  Plagiarism at its most blatant includes  handing in an entire paper that is not one's own; it also includes failing to document one's sources.  When writing a research paper, avoid unintentional plagiarism. Because almost no knowledge other than eye-witness accounts is truly original, be sure to find sources for all non-trivial information. Plagiarism can be grounds for failing a paper or the course as a whole.

== Resources To Use ==

The humanities category offers many good sources from which to gather information.  The Internet is fast becoming an important source of information for humanities writing.  There are many history sites, journalism and news sites, sites focusing on the history of film, sites dedicated to womens' issues, and so on.  More traditional physical resources include dictionaries, encyclopedias, biographies, indexes, abstracts, and periodicals, and our old friend, the library.

As you can see, there are many resources from which to choose when writing your paper.  Start at the most basic level and progress from there.  For example, if you are writing about a specific work of a famous author, the obvious place to begin is with a careful reading of the work in question. Once you are done, try to articulate what you know to be true, what you think is ''probably'' true, and what is open to question: that is, what you might need to find out. It is helpful to actually go through the physical process of writing out two or three key questions that you would like to focus on.

At that point, you may want begin your further researches with a search through an encyclopedia, or do an online search for available resources, including interviews.  After you have found the information you need there, you might then search a through a card catalog in a library for specific books.  You may find that while searching for one specific book you will stumble upon many other useful books on the same subject.  You can then begin to look through book reviews for information on your subject.  Book reviews can be especially informative in that they will often will identify important themes, raise new questions, and broaden your sense of what is at stake in the text.  Next, you may want to try searching for articles in periodicals, and even abstracts of articles, which will provide a summary of the content of the potential article.

'''Waldorf Salad''', created by Oscar Tschirky in 1890 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, New York, in the United States of America.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 large Granny Smith apple
* 1 large Red Delicious apple
* 1 tablespoon of lemon juice
* 1/3 cup (80g) of raisins
* 1/3 cup (80g) of chopped walnuts
* 1/3 cup (80g) of chopped celery
* 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Sugar | sugar]]
* 6 large leaves of lettuce
* 10 halved maraschino cherries

== Procedure ==

# Slice the apples into wedges, place in a bowl.
# Pour lemon juice on the apple wedges, and ensure a light coating to prevent browning.
# Plumpen the raisins by placing them in warm water for 5 minutes, drain well.
# Mix celery, raisins and walnuts into the bowl of apple wedges.
# Mix the mayonnaise and sugar together, then pour into the apple mixture, ensure a light coating on all items.
# Chill for at least 30 minutes
# Place three lettuce leaves on a large plate and three on another, place half of the mixture on each set of leaves, sprinkle 5 cherries on each salad.
# Serve

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* Though the original salad only used apples, celery and mayonnaise; walnuts mixed in have become an integral part of the modern version of the salad and cherries are only used as a sweet addition to further the contrasts within the salad.

Instead of raisins, try using grapes to create the same sort of taste but more wholly and not as rich.

'''[[w:Conrail|Conrail]]''' (officially the '''Consolidated Rail Corporation''') was a major [[w:railroad|railroad]] in the [[w:Northeast U.S.|Northeast U.S.]] from 1976 to 1999. It was set up by the Federal Government to take over the bankrupt railroads in the Northeast, and eventually became profitable and was split between two competing systems ([[w:CSX Transportation|CSX Transportation]] and the [[w:Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern Railway]]).

==[[w:Regional Rail Reorganization Act|Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973==
Public Law 93-236 signed January 2, 1974
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
;(a)  Findings
The Congress finds and declares that—
#Essential rail service in the midwest and northeast region of the United States is provided by railroads which are today insolvent and attempting to undergo reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act.
#This essential rail service is threatened with cessation or significant curtailment because of the inability of the trustees of such railroads to formulate acceptable plans for reorganization. This rail service is operated over rail properties which were acquired for a public use, but which have been permitted to deteriorate and now require extensive rehabilitation and modernization.
#The public convenience and necessity require adequate and efficient rail service in this region and throughout the Nation to meet the needs of commerce, the national defense, the environment, and the service requirements of passengers, United States mail, shippers, States and their political subdivisions, and consumers.
#Continuation and improvement of essential rail service in this region is also necessary to preserve and maintain adequate national rail services and an efficient national rail transportation system.
#Rail service and rail transportation offer economic and environmental advantages with respect to land use, air pollution, noise levels, energy efficiency and conservation, resource allocation, safety, and cost per ton-mile of movement to such extent that the preservation and maintenance of adequate and efficient rail service is in the national interest.
#These needs cannot be met without substantial action by the Federal Government.
|The rail system in the Northeast was dying. All the major railroads in the region, most notably [[w:Penn Central Transportation|Penn Central Transportation]], had filed for bankruptcy, and it was likely that there would be no fix without the Federal Government playing a major role.
|-
|
;(b)  Purposes
It is therefore declared to be the purpose of Congress in this chapter to provide for—
#the identification of a rail service system in the midwest and northeast region which is adequate to meet the needs and service requirements of this region and of the national rail transportation system;
#the reorganization of railroads in this region into an economically viable system capable of providing adequate and efficient rail service to the region;
#the establishment of the United States Railway Association, with enumerated powers and responsibilities;
#the establishment of the Consolidated Rail Corporation, with enumerated powers and responsibilities;
#assistance to States and local and regional transportation authorities for continuation of local rail services threatened with cessation; and
#necessary Federal financial assistance at the lowest possible cost to the general tax­payer
|Thus the [[w:United States Railway Association|United States Railway Association]] and Conrail will be established.

    1116.       Applicability of other laws.                          

Sec. 1101. Congressional findings and declarations

      The Congress finds and declares that - 
        (1) the processes set in motion by the Regional Rail
      Reorganization Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.] have failed to
      create a self-sustaining railroad system in the Northeast region
      of the United States and have cost United States taxpayers many
      billions of dollars over original estimates;
        (2) current arrangements for the provision of rail freight and
      commuter service in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the
      United States are inadequate to meet the transportation needs of
      the public and the needs of national security;
        (3) although the Federal Government has provided billions of
      dollars in assistance for Conrail and its employees, the Federal
      interest in ensuring the flow of interstate commerce through rail
      service in the private sector has not been achieved, and the
      protection of interstate commerce requires Federal intervention
      to preserve essential rail service in the private sector;
        (4) the provisions for protection of employees of bankrupt
      railroads contained in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of
      1973 [45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.] have resulted in the payment of
      benefits far in excess of levels anticipated at the time of
      enactment, have imposed an excessive fiscal burden on the Federal
      taxpayer, and are now an obstacle to the establishment of
      improved rail service and continued rail employment in the
      Northeast region of the United States; and
        (5) since holding Conrail liable for employee protection
      payments would destroy its prospects of becoming a profitable
      carrier and further injure its employees, an alternative employee
      protection system must be developed and funded.

Sec. 1102. Statement of purpose

      It is therefore declared to be the purpose of the Congress in
    this subtitle to provide for - 
        (1) the removal by a date certain of the Federal Government's
      obligation to subsidize the freight operations of Conrail;
        (2) transfer of Conrail commuter service responsibilities to
      one or more entities whose principal purpose is the provision of
      commuter service; and
        (3) an orderly return of Conrail freight service to the private
      sector.

Sec. 1103. Goals and objectives

      It is the goal of this subtitle to provide Conrail the
    opportunity to become profitable through the achievement of the
    following objectives:
      (1) Nonagreement personnel
        (A) Employees who are not subject to collective bargaining
      agreements (hereafter in this section referred to as
      &quot;nonagreement personnel&quot;) should forego wage increases and
      benefits in an amount proportionately equivalent to the amount
      foregone by agreement employees pursuant to paragraph (4) of this
      section, adjusted annually to reflect inflation.
        (B) After May 1, 1981, the number of nonagreement personnel
      should be reduced proportionately to any reduction in agreement
      employees (excluding reductions pursuant to the termination
      program under section 797a of this title).
      (2) Suppliers
        To facilitate the orderly movement of goods in interstate
      commerce, materials and services should continue to be available
      to Conrail, under normal business practices, including the
      provision of credit and normal financing arrangements.
      (3) Shippers
        Conrail should utilize the revenue opportunities available to
      it under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and subtitle IV of title
      49.
      (4) Agreement employees
        (A) Conrail should enter into collective bargaining agreements
      with its employees which would reduce Conrail's costs in an
      amount equal to $200,000,000 a year, beginning April 1, 1981,
      adjusted annually to reflect inflation.
        (B) Agreements under this subparagraph may provide for
      reductions in wage increases and for changes in fringe benefits
      common to agreement employees, including vacations and holidays.
        (C) The cost reductions required under this subparagraph in the
      first year of the agreement may be deferred, but the aggregate
      cost reductions should be no less than an average of $200,000,000
      per year for each of the first three one-year periods beginning
      April 1, 1981.
        (D) The amount of cost reductions provided under this paragraph
      shall be calculated by subtracting the cost of an agreement
      entered into under this paragraph from (i) the cost that would
      otherwise result from the application of the national agreement
      reached by railroad industry and its employees, or (ii) until
      such national agreement is reached, the cost which the United
      States Railway Association estimates would result from the
      application of such a national agreement.

Sec. 1104. Definitions

      As used in this subtitle, unless the context otherwise requires,
    the term:
        (1) &quot;Amtrak&quot; means the National Railroad Passenger Corporation
      created under chapter 243 of title 49.
        (2) &quot;Commission&quot; means the Interstate Commerce Commission.
        (3) &quot;Commuter authority&quot; means any State, local, or regional
      authority, corporation, or other entity established for purposes
      of providing commuter service, and includes the Metropolitan
      Transportation Authority, the Connecticut Department of
      Transportation, the Maryland Department of Transportation, the
      Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, the New
      Jersey Transit Corporation, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
      Authority, the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, any
      successor agencies, and any entity created by one or more such
      agencies for the purpose of operating, or contracting for the
      operation of, commuter service.
        (4) &quot;Commuter service&quot; means short-haul rail passenger service
      operated in metropolitan and suburban areas, whether within or
      across the geographical boundaries of a State, usually

Sec. 1112. Interstate Commerce Commission proceedings

    (a) Final decisions involving railroads in bankruptcy
      Notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle IV of title 49,
    in any proceeding before the Commission under section 11324 or
    11325 of title 49 involving a railroad in the Region, as defined in
    section 702 of this title, which was in a bankruptcy proceeding
    under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act on November 4, 1979, the
    Commission shall, with or without a hearing, issue a final decision
    within a period not to exceed 180 days after receipt of an
    application under either such section.
    (b) Final decisions involving profitable railroads
      Notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle IV of title 49,
    in any proceeding before the Commission under section 11324 or
    11325 of title 49 involving a profitable railroad in the Region, as
    defined in section 702 of this title, which received a loan under
    section 721(a) of this title, the Commission shall, with or without
    a hearing, issue a final decision within a period not to exceed 180

    (c) Interest of United States attaching in bankruptcy, liquidation,
      abandonment, etc.
      (1) If the Secretary determines under subsection (b) of this
    section that there is an agreement between a profitable railroad in
    the Region (as defined in section 702 of this title) which received
    a loan under section 721(a) of this title and a prospective

    the interest of the United States in any debt of such a railroad to
    an interest which attaches to such debt in the event of bankruptcy
    or substantial sale or liquidation of the assets of the railroad.
    The Secretary may substitute for the evidence of such debt
    contingency notes payable solely from the railroad operating assets
    then securing such debt, including reinvestments thereof, or such
    other contingency notes as the Secretary deems appropriate and
    which conform to the terms set forth in this subsection.
      (2) If the interest of the United States is limited under
    paragraph (1), any new debt issued by such a railroad subsequent to
    the issuance of the debt described in paragraph (1) may have such
    higher priority in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or
    abandonment of the assets of such a railroad than the debt
    described in such paragraph as the Secretary and the railroad may
    agree.
      (3) In carrying out the duties under this subsection, the
    Secretary may (A) enter into such agreements, (B) in accordance
    with any such agreements, cancel or cause to be cancelled or amend
    or cause to be amended any notes or securities currently held by
    agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, and (C) accept

      negotiations for employee transfers
      After January 1, 1983, Conrail shall be relieved of the
    responsibility to provide crews for intercity passenger service on
    the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak, Amtrak Commuter, and Conrail, and
    the employees with seniority in both freight and passenger service
    shall commence negotiations not later than 120 days after August
    13, 1981, for the right of such employees to move from one service
    to the other once each six-month period. Such agreement shall
    ensure that Conrail, Amtrak, and Amtrak Commuter have the right to
    furlough one employee in the same class or craft for each employee
    who returns through the exercise of seniority rights. If agreement
    is not reached within 360 days, such matter shall be submitted to
    binding arbitration.
    (b) Eligibility of employees for employee protection benefits
      Conrail employees who are deprived of employment by an assumption
    or discontinuance of intercity passenger service by Amtrak shall be
    eligible for employee protection benefits under section 797 (!1) of
    this title, notwithstanding any other provision of law, agreement,
    or arrangement, and notwithstanding the inability of such employees
    otherwise to meet the eligibility requirements of such section.

    series B preferred stock and the common stock conveyed to the
    Secretary under section 1107 (!1) of this title shall be deemed to
    be without fair market value unless in a proceeding brought under
    section 1105(a)(4) of this title the special court shall have
    determined that such securities had a value and shall have entered
    a judgment against the United States for that value. In such an
    event, the securities shall for purposes of section 746 of this
    title be deemed to have that value found by the special court.


Sec. 1116. Applicability of other laws

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

= Constructing a Simple Derivation =

Our derivations consists two types of elements.

* ''Derived lines.''  A derived line has three parts:
:* ''Line number.''  This allows the line to be referred to later.
:* ''Formula.''  The purpose of a derivation is to derive formulae, and this is the formula that has been derived at this line.
:* ''Annotation.'' This specifies the justification for entering the formula into the derivation.
* ''Fencing.''  These include:
:* Vertical lines between the line number and the formula.  These are used to set off subderivations which we will get to in the next module.
:* Horizontal lines separating premises and temporary assumptions from other lines.  When we get to predicate logic, there are restrictions on using premises and temporary assumptions.  Setting them off in an easy-to-recognize fashion aids in adhering to the restrictions.

We sometimes are a bit sloppy and speak of the formula as if it were the entire line.  But the line also 
includes the formula's entourage, the line number and the annotation.

== Rules ==

=== Premises ===

The annotation for a premise is 'Premise'.  We will require that all premises to be used in the derivation 
be the first lines.  No non-premise line is allowed to appear before a premise.  In theory, an argument can 
have infinitely many premises.  However, derivations have only finitely many lines, so only finitely many 
premises can be used in the derivation.  We do not require that ''all'' premises appear before other 
lines.  This would be impossible for arguments with infinitely many premises.  But we do require that 
all premises to appear in the derivation appear before any other line.

The requirement that premises used in the derivation appear as its first lines is stricter than 
absolutely necessary.  However, certain restrictions that will be needed when we get to predicate 
logic make the requirement at least a useful convention.

=== Inference rules ===

We introduced all but two inference rules in the previous module, and will introduce the other 
two in the next module.

=== Axioms ===

This derivation system does not have any axioms.

== An example derivation ==

We will construct a derivation for the following argument:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q},\ \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{S},\ \mathrm{S} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''&amp;there4;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


First, we enter the premises into the derivation:

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| 1.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|-
| 2.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|- 
| 3.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|-
|}
|}


Note the vertical line between the line numbers and the formulae.  That is part of the fencing that controls 
subderivations.  We will get to subderivations in the next module.  Until then, we simply put a single vertical line the length of the derivation.  Note also the horizontal line under the premises.  This is fencing that helps distinguish 
the premises from the other lines in the derivation.

Now we need to use the premises.  Applying KE to the first premise twice. we add the following lines:

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| 4.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 1 KE
|-
| 5.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 1 KE
|-
|}
|}


Now we need to use the second premise by applying CE.  Since CE has two antecedent lines, we first need to derive the other line that we will need.  We thus add these lines:

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| 6.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;5px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| 4 DI
|-
| 7.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 2, 6 CE
|-
|}
|}


Now we will use the third premise by applying CE.  Again, we first need to derive the other line we will need.  The 
new lines are:

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| 8.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 5, 7 KI
|-
| 9.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 3, 8 CE
|-
|}
|}


Note line 9 is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the conclusion of our argument, so we are done.  The 
conclusion does not always fall into our lap so nicely, but here it did.  The complete derivation runs:

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| 1.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|-
| 2.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|- 
| 3.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|-
| 4.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 1 KE
|-

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm wondering if should make a separate section for the elements of a paper, maybe named, &quot;Elements of a Paper.&quot;

Right now I am editing &quot;Writing in the Humanities.&quot;  I am doing work on the Thesis Statement and Introduction.  But what I am finding is that the information on the Thesis Statement will apply to all papers written that require a thesis statement, not only to writing a paper in the humanities.

If we separate this out a little, it would give the student visiting this site the clearer picture of how to write a thesis statement, introduction, etc.

After doing some research, however, I may decide to keep it this way.  Writing a thesis statement for a paper in the humanities will differ a bit from writing a thesis statement for a paper in the sciences.


--[[User:tigerrat29|tigerrat29]] 11 October 2006 (UTC) There is a very solid foundation here.  I found at least one instance of &quot;sexist&quot; language, where all authors are referred to as &quot;he&quot;. We'll need to clean those out in order to be SCSU kosher.  Be looking for places to clean up phrasing, sometimes these authors use more words than necessary or unclear words.  The only other thing that I'd like to see happen on this page is some clarifying on the difference between &quot;interpretive&quot; and &quot;analytical&quot; writing.  Reading the entry here, I'm not sure there's a clear distinction.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Example: Configuring MS Visual C++ to use external libraries ===
The [[C++ Programming/Libraries/Boost|Boost library]] is used as example library.

{{NOTE|[http://www.boost.org/ Boost.org] has a install guide named Getting Started on Windows, that points to an automatic installed provided by [http://www.boostpro.com/products/free BoostPro Computing] (commonly supporting the previous and older  release versions), noting also that if used with the option “Source and Documentation” deselected (selected by default), it will not show the libs/ subdirectory. This will disable the user from rebuilding part of the libraries that aren't only header files. This makes installing it yourself as shown in this section the best option.|Panic2k4}} 

Considering you already have decompressed and have the binary part of the Boost library built. There the steps which have to be performed:

==== Include directory ====
Set up the ''include directory''. This is the directory that contains the header files (''.h/hpp''), which describes the library interface:

[[Image:Visual_studio_includedirectories.png|include directories]]

==== Library directory ====
Set up the ''library directory''. This is the directory that contains the pre-compiled library files (''.lib''):

[[Image:Visual_studio_librarydirectories.png|library directories]]

==== Library files ====
Enter library filenames in ''additional dependencies'' for the libraries to use:
[[Image:Visual_studio_additionaldependencies.png|library filenames (the Boost &quot;REGEXP&quot;-library in this example)]]&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Some libraries (such as e.g. Boost) uses ''[[w:auto-linking|auto-linking]]'' to automate the process of selecting library files for linking, based on which header-files are included. Manual selection of library filenames are not required for such libraries if your compiler supports auto-linking.

==== Dynamic libraries ====
In case of dynamically loaded (''.dll'') libraries, one also have to place the DLL-files either in the same folder as the executable, or in the system [[w:Path (variable)|PATH]].

==== Run-time library ====
The libraries also have to be compiled with the same run-time library as the one used in your project. Many libraries therefore come in different editions, depending on whether they are compiled for ''single-'' or ''multi-threaded runtime'' and ''debug'' or ''release runtime'', as well as whether they contain ''debug symbols'' or not.

===Size Concerns===

First, reality is, the bigger your opponent relative to you, the harder it is to take him down. Period. However, using and avoiding certain positions and techniques can maximize the probability of success and minimize the probability of getting smashed, the latter of which is definitely a bad thing when you are much smaller than your opponent.

Second, the general rule with significantly larger opponents is that anything you do needs to keep the risk low of getting caught and squelched underneath your opponent at which point certain physics and mechanics will be working hard against you.

Third, I tend to avoid my final attack as being a traditional double, outside single, or inside single leg (except for a very low single leg sometimes) takedown as it gives too much of an opportunity for a much larger opponent to smash me down simply by virtue of the size and weight difference. Those shots tend to be feigns for other attacks.

Fourth, I tend to ultimately attack the head (i.e., the head and arm or front headlock) a lot with the idea that I would rather my smaller weight be on top of a larger weight than vice versa. This is frequently set up with leg attacks (and secured as my opponent pulls his leg back, lowers his hips, or sprawls to defend).

Fifth, with regard to throws for larger opponents, a fireman's carry (if down properly) or an arm throw (but to my knees as opposed to a backstep) seems to work for me as most larger opponents tend to try to push and over power you so those two throws allow me to get underneath them very deeply, like a fulcrum (i.e., my body remains upright, not bent over more vulnerable to getting squashed), and continue their motion to the ground although it is especially crucial with a larger opponent that you keep your grips and position tight. Any slack is likely doom. And it definitely sucks when somebody 50 to 100 pounds is sprawling on and squashing you. Been there, done that.

Sixth, not exactly a throw but I like an explosive inside trip if an opponent is not outrageously larger than me.

Sixth, with regard to other types of attacks, I will occasionally, but not particularly frequently, attack a very low single to the ankle. If I get in, I am usually in decent shape. If you fail on your entry, you get squashed (the obvious risk for this particular attack). I will try drags to get to and around my opponent's body frequently which tends to be my main strategy (i.e., get around behind). Again, pinging shots against a much larger opponent is not particularly wise.

Seventh, most much larger opponent's will tend to try to over power you so having good pummeling and tie ups are crucial. However, when going against a much larger opponent, you need to modify such by learning to keep a bit more space and changing position frequently so they can't simply get a good hold on you and overpower you. Traditional chest to chest pummeling or collar tie against a much larger and stronger opponent is risky. A two on one tie, for example, is less risky.

Eighth, my defense is good, and keeping with the notion that I would rather be above, than below, a much larger opponent, I sometimes will subtly get out of position to encourage my opponent to attack, preparing for such, and then keeping the back of his head at my lower abdomen, getting to head and arm position, etc. Then I spin behind or attack a choke (and then spin behind if defended well).

Ninth, if a much larger opponent does overpower you and you are losing it, accept the situation and immediately get your guard and deal with it from there. Bigger opponent's will take you down at least sometimes regardless of your skill, etc., simply based on the size difference. Therefore, getting to guard quickly and effective, and obviously having a game from there, is crucial as you will end up underneath some larger opponents.Then you might get pinned .

      <text xml:space="preserve">== LibrePOS Hardware Requirements ==
CPU: Pentium or Compatible
RAM: At least 64MB
== Known working hardware ==
The following hardware has been tested and found to work in LibrePOS. It is not a complete list, so if you don't find a hardware here it doesn't mean is isn't supported.
&lt;!-- you can add your hardware here --&gt;
===Printers===
*Citizen CBM1000 and Citizen Citizen CBM1000-II
*Epson TM-T88II and Epson TM-T88III
*Epson TM-T88IV Serial under Ubuntu Linux and Windows XP
*Epson TM-U220
*Epson TM-U230 Serial
*Epson TM-T881V Parallel
*Ithaca iTherm 280
*Ithaca 500 Ink Jet Parallel
*Star TSP100 USB on Windows XP
*Star TSP600
*Posligne  TRP 100 serial kubuntu
*Posligne  TRP 100 USB/XP

===Barcode Scanners===
*Any keyboard wedge scanner

===Touchscreen ===
*Epson SR-610
*Epson DM-LS121T
Touchscreens work like a mouse, so if the operating system supports it, it will be supported by LibrePOS

== Receipt Printers ==
==== USB ====
If you want to use a network printer or a usb printer (in windows), use the net use command, eg:
(from the command prompt) 

net use lpt1 \\computerName\printerName /persistent:yes

(You can find out what your printerName is by going to windows explorer and typing in 
\\computerName
The printer will (hopefully) come up in the list of network-available items.

Then in LibrePOS configuration, choose file and type in lpt1.

from: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q314499
and
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1357172&amp;forum_id=434921

==== Parallel ====
To test if your printer is well connected, issue the following commands. Change lpt1 or lp0 to whichever port you are using

'''Under Windows:'''
&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;test&quot; &gt; LPT1&lt;/pre&gt;
'''Under Linux'''
&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;test&quot; &gt; /dev/lp0&lt;/pre&gt;

Try configuring the printer as &quot;file&quot; and type in lpt1 (or /dev/lp0 for linux).

==== Serial ====
Check your cable. Some serial printers require a null modem cable, a standard serial cable+null modem adapter or even some other configuration in order to work, please check your manual or contact the manufacturer. Bytes2000 has confirmed in the forums that a Standard DB9 Null modem adapter from Radio Shack that implements the &quot;Loop back handshaking&quot; pin configuration

To test if your printer is well connected, issue the following commands. Change com1 or ttyS0 to whichever port you are using

'''Under Windows:'''
&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;test&quot; &gt; com1&lt;/pre&gt;
'''Under Linux'''
&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;test&quot; &gt; /dev/ttyS0&lt;/pre&gt;

If the printer prints the word &quot;test&quot; then you are ready to go. On LibrePOS the easiest way to use the printer is with RXTX as it is bundled with LibrePOS.

Non Epson printers may have problems with the image command as the ESC/POS standard varies a bit from different manufacturers. In particular, some CBM printers can't handle the image command. If this happens, try [[../Administrator Guide#Editing_the_image|removing the image from the ticket]].

== Cash drawer ==
Ensure your printer can control your cash drawer. The drawer is controlled by the printer.

== Barcode scanner ==
&lt;!--By Randall Perry--&gt;

Bar code scanners come in many flavors from wands to handhelds to flat beds.  Scanners also have a variety of ways to attach to your PC terminal: USB, Serial, PS/2, BUS, Bluetooth.

The easiest to get working are the PS/2 model handhelds. They require NO software or configuration (typically).  They plug into a keyboard port and 'key in' the UPC barcode (and usually a carraige return).  The PS/2 barcode scanners work EXCELLENT with LibrePOS in the stores I have setup.
This is NOT just for adding inventory, but works to key in orders...Just like any other store does.

You can pickup used barcode scanners for $5 to $50.   These are adequate for reading UPC barcodes.  While laser scanners support data matrix, 2D, PDF417 and other formats...why spend the money for this? If you are only working retail, you will typically be using just plain vanilla UPC barcodes.  Save your money for a decent receipt printer.

The CueCat USB Port scanner works with zero configuration on Linux Fedora Core 6. The usbhid driver auto-detects and magically converts the data to numbers. Simply click in the barcode field in LibrePOS and run the scanner over a barcode. The cord is a good 6 feet long too. And, of course, the price is right when buying used.

== Magnetic stripe reader ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">--[[User:Joshboyd|Joshboyd]] 23:29, 5 December 2007 (UTC) I rewrote a lot of this section. I hope I didn't step on your toes, Mark. But, then again, it is a Wiki; so, what's here today may be gone tomorrow anyway.

I redid the header, but I'm not attached to it, so changes or suggestions to make it more effective would be appreciated.  Also, I keep referring to the process as &quot;revising&quot; because of the chapter title, but really I feel like it sounds off when I don't refer to it in most places as &quot;revision.&quot;  The reason I don't is because I want to stay more inline with how the chapter refers to it so I don't make it confusing for people who might not be as advanced as some of us are.  Is this an issue?  --[[User:Hema|Hema]] 16:48, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

I agree that the professional editor section is problematic.  It also seems to completely ignore the idea that most, if not all, the people using this textbook probably are not using a professional editor anyways.  I'm striking it.  Someone can bring it back if they feel it's an error to get rid of it. --[[User:Hema|Hema]] 16:32, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

== Back to the Drawing Board == I think the Rhet and Comp book would be much better if we clarified our definition/description of revising and editing. I suggest we do the following: 
- Place Revision above Editing on the table of contents page
- Divide Revision into (a) Global Revision (i.e. overall organization/structure, cogency, purpose, supporting information, audience, etc) and (b) Sentence Level Revision (i.e. active verbs, parallelism, modification issues, concision, accuracy in word choice, etc.)
- Refuse to discuss any of the issues above in the section on editing (other than to say, &quot;If you have questions about word choice or usage, refer to the chapter on Revision). 
- Define editing as proofreading for grammatical errors (i.e. usage, pronoun-antecedent agreement, subject-verb agreement, punctuation, spelling, verb tense, adjective and adverb usage, capitalization, etc.)
- Clearly convey that editing is the last step before a paper is turned in

I also think the distinctions between editing and revising only become more muddled when one discusses the tasks of professional editors. Professional editors do not just edit as I have defined it above. They are very much involved in revision as well. It's actually unfortunate we don't call them professional revisers. I think all the discussion about professional editors is superfluous and misleading. I'd really like to see these two chapters revised!--[[User:Joshboyd|Joshboyd]] 21:51, 14 November 2007 (UTC)

Perhaps this page is more on track than I thought. It includes a section showing the distinctions between revising and editing and proofreading, which I like. Can we take the editing chapter and include it in this chapter. The chapter could be renamed--Revising, Editing, Proofreading. I think separate chapters include too much overlap of material. For example, the editing chapter includes a section on micro vs. macro editing. Macro editing, however, is basically the same thing as revision. So much for being concise. To me it makes much more sense to lump all of this information into one chapter.--[[User:Joshboyd|Joshboyd]] 22:42, 29 November 2007 (UTC)  


--[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 23:07, 16 October 2005 (UTC) I'm a bit concerned here that we're not sure what &quot;revising&quot; is and how it differs from editing, reviewing, and proofreading. I'd suggest you re-read the chapter about the writing process and make we're making a clear distinction here for the reader.

''Remember E.B. White's mantra: &quot;Omit needless words. Omit needless words. Omit needless words.&quot;''  - This is great.

Would it be beneficial to include the difference between revising, editing, and proofreading in ALL of these sections?
--[[User:Emily.isackson|Emily.isackson]] ([[User talk:Emily.isackson|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Emily.isackson|contribs]]) 21:04, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

Point of confusion: I'm not sure how the version that I'm looking at today has been changed since Matt Barton's October 16, 2005 comment about the need to make clearer distinctions for the reader. As is, I understood the explanations of the differences between revising, editing, and proofreading.

Why use an asterisk in &quot;sh*t&quot;? 

&quot;Read and re-read your paper. In the first read-through consider overall purpose of the paper and whether it is expressed clearly.&quot; -- seems to be missing &quot;the&quot; before &quot;overall purpose&quot;

I really like this kind of commentary:

''But wait--don't you need to inflate your text so you can meet the minimum word count? Wouldn't it be better to use &quot;due to the fact that&quot; for &quot;because&quot; and &quot;in addition to&quot; for &quot;and,&quot; since these phrases use far more words? Answer: NO. Any experienced reader will instantly see through such a pitiful scheme and will likely become irritated by the resulting &quot;flabby&quot; prose.''

... because it hits the wordiness nail on the head, and it's also opinionated and funny.

&quot;you probably havea a problem with organization and transitions.&quot; -- should be &quot;you probably have a a problem with organization and transitions.&quot;

The &quot;conclusions&quot; section could probably be fleshed out. --[[User:Matt.helm|Matt.helm]] ([[User talk:Matt.helm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Matt.helm|contribs]]) 21:23, 27 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Generators are based on the fact that when a wire, or a coil, is moved into and out of a magnetic field then a voltage will be generated between the ends of that wire or coil. The magnitude of that voltage is proportional (within a limit) to the strength of the magnetic field, and also the number of turns of the coil, while the direction of that voltage depends on the polarity of the magnetic field (North pole or South pole), and which leads of the voltmeter are connected to which end of the wire or coil&quot;.....'''''Italic text'''My question is if a bulb is connected across these terminals will it glow''






== Electrical Engineering ==
I've created a category for electrical engineering books. use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:Electrical Engineering]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to add this book to that category, if desired. If this book doesnt start to progress eventually (and i know writing a book takes time) I will probably start a motion to merge this book with a more general book on &quot;Electromechanical Devices&quot; that i am planning to start writing in the weeks ahead. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 23:12, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

== Stub==

This book is a stub. It hasnt been edited since June for any reason other then to add proposed sections to the current &quot;table of contents&quot; and a spam revert. The two pages that this book does have are short, and uninformative. I will probably put this book up for deletion soon. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:02, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
:Since this is up for deletion I have taken it upon myself to begin editing this book and replace some of the original content which was very unstructured and not very informative. I have also added a section in which some info on vector algebra could be placed, I propose something which covers the following:  a reasonable discussion of scalar fields, vector fields, vector algebra and vector calculus covering the following concepts
:*Scalar fields versus vector fields, how vectors have both magnitude and direction
:*Product of a scalar and a vector
:*Magnitudes and unit vectors
:*Vector addition and subtractionee a 
:*The scalar (dot) product of vectors
:*The vector (cross) product of vectors
:*Vector integration including line and surface integration
:The cross-product is particularly crucial as it greatly aids in determining the direction of the forces on a moving charge in a magnetic field.--[[User:crobar|crobar]]

::Great! For what it is worth, it isn't up for deletion and if you disagree with merging this page somewhere else you can take down the merge sign (at both pages if applicable).  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:32, 15 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about the study of engineering signals and systems, from a discipline-neutral approach. It is a fundamental starting point in the field of engineering, and serves as the basic material that other advanced books in the engineering subject area are based. This book looks at the concepts of systems, serving as an introduction to systems theory. Also, this book examines signals, and the way that signals interact with physical systems. 

While this book strives to be discipline-neutral, it currently is focused strongly on electrical engineering concepts. It is hoped that this book will be expanded to include information from other disciplines as well.

== What this book is not ==

Like with the other EE books, i am going to list here what i think the scope of this book ''should be'', although this is certainly not set in stone.

#This is not a math book. We are not here to teach math, that is the job of the Math bookshelf. We cannot, however limit this book to the tools that are provided in math books because most math books do not give any coverage (at least no adequate coverage) to the Fourier, Laplace, or Z Transforms. We can introduce what we need here, but there is no sense rewriting what other people have already written.
#This book has a clear focus. The [[Circuit Theory]] and the [[Circuit Theory 2]] wikibook cover basic hardware topics, and in a sense this book will cover the &quot;software&quot;. This book will examine signals, and will demonstrate techniques for analyzing signals. Also, this book will consider hardware topics, but we are past the stage where we need to be diagramming the locations of individual circuit components. 
#This book has a clear scope. Like any wikibook, it is counter-productive to include more information in this book then logically belongs here. By making the EE bookshelf highly modular, we allow for people who are taking divergent learning paths (Electrical Engineers versus Computer Engineers, Electromechanical Engineers, Automotive Engineers, or Biomedical Engineers) To read on the topics that interest them, without loading the reader down with excess baggage. This book should be limited to studies of signals, Fourier analysis, Z-transform analysis, and an introduction to basic filters. More advanced topics can be saved for another wikibook.
#This book should have lots of pictures. A study of electric signals is best facilitated by having lots and lots of pictures. In a sense, this is the trade-off: less math, and more graphs.

I've outlined on [[User:Whiteknight|my user page]] a basic EE &quot;curriculum&quot; that i think forms a very natural progression of EE-based learning, while at the same time allowing people to diverge into different &quot;specialties&quot; as their interest dictates. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 22:15, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

== need some diagrams ==

I feel like i've written up skeletons of all the pages that i can without supporting images. The remainder of the chapters in this book will be heavily graphical, by necessity. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:50, 20 October 2005 (UTC)



== Stability, transient performance ==

Since this book is also about Systems, shouldn't it have some sections about system stability and transient response? And perhaps things like negative feedback, root locus diagrams, and other useful things (I'm currently taking a class in Control Systems so I'm no expert on the subject, just trying to give some suggestions - what I've mentioned is all we've learned so far) --[[User:Gautamraj|Gautamraj]] Sun Nov  6 08:35:01 UTC 2005

:I would like to write a book about all those subjects, because i also have taken a number of control classes (classical controls, modern controls, digital controls). However, i feel like the addition of all those subjects into this book would cause this book to grow far too large, and lose way too much focus. Instead, i am preparing an outline of a future book that will encompass many different types of electrical control systems. you can find the outline for this book at [[Control Systems]]. Let me know if you have any suggestions about that book, but i probably won't put it into active duty for a long while now (until i can better expand it). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:19, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

::The outline mentioned above has been put on a bookshelf at [[Control Systems]] --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:24, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

== Electrical Engineering, Basic signals ==

That book was merged into Signals and Systems at 19:25, 9 December 2005 (UTC). The primary contributer was [[User:WarrenWilkinson]]. Here is the contents of the talk page to that book:

----
To others who would wish to help author this wikibook, I recommend we keep detailed deriviations and proofs and advanged applications of things like the Forier Transforms, forier series, Laplace transforms and convolution in seperate eBooks and link to them in the prerequisites. That way this very advanced information can be centralized for all wikibooks to link too. In this book we should cover the application and usuage of these things, and link to more advanced texts that prove these theroums.

[[User:WarrenWilkinson|WarrenWilkinson]] 01:14, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)

=== title of book ===

maybe this should just be called introduction to signal processing? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 15:38, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:I think that's a bit narrow. This book already has a section on filters (which are systems), and I would like to cover more systems eventually here as well. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:34, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

=== Spelling and zeroes ===

Good work to the person who started compiling this book. I however, recommend that someone needs to go through and check the spelling properly. I am just about to go through and fix some of the spelling mistakes I've seen, and take out some of the rubbish that people have edited in: Example, string of zeros. &lt;br&gt;
I'm considering seriously contributing to this book, and I'll try to stick to the recommended guideline of linking detailed proofs.&lt;br&gt;
Although, if the text does become more comprensive at some stage, adding them might be cool, as long as they are clearly seperate from the more concise statements and applications.

== New Sections ==

I would like to start adding new sections to this book, because it is currently very small and could handle new information. I would like to include more information about the frequency-domain, and I would like to add a section on digital domain (z-transform introduction, digital filters by poles and zeros, etc). If anybody else can think of other subjects that would go well in this book, write about them here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:52, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

I also want to add more information about Bode plots here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:08, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What Do Commas Do? ==

As you can see in the list below, commas serve several different purposes. For now, don’t worry about any unfamiliar terms; simply observe the main actions commas do: ''join, emphasize, contain'', and ''separate''.

# They work with a coordinating conjunction to '''join two independent clauses''' within a sentence. 
# They '''emphasize introductory elements''' at the beginning of a sentence or clause.
# They '''set off cumulative elements''' at the end of a sentence or clause.
# They '''separate a dependent clause at the beginning of a sentence''' from the independent clause following it.
# They work in pairs to '''contain restrictive modifiers''' within a sentence.
# They work in pairs to '''contain parenthetical expressions''' within a sentence.
# They '''separate two or more adjectives''' that independently describe the same noun.
# They '''separate quotations''' from their attributions. 
# They '''separate items in a list.'''
# They '''separate elements in dates, numbers, personal titles, and addresses.'''

While there are many different ways to use commas in writing, most comma usages fall into three situations. If you know the basic rule for these three cases, you should be set for comma usage. 

# Put a comma before a coordinating conjunction '''(for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)''' that separates two independent clauses. ''Example: I wanted to drive to the mall''', but''' my car wouldn't start.'' 
# Put a comma after introductory words, phrases, or clauses in a sentence. ''Example: '''Although''' it was a good offer''',''' I felt that I needed to explore other options.'' 
# Use commas to set off elements that interrupt or add information in a sentence. ''Example: Tommy''', my older brother,''' loved to punch me for telling his secrets.''

== Commas with two independent clauses ==

Used with coordinating conjunctions, commas allow writers to let readers know how their complete thoughts (as expressed in independent clauses) relate to one another. After all, our thoughts build on each other and interact with each other. Unless we’re merely listing things or free-associating, our thoughts rarely develop in separate “boxes,” but rather tend more to develop in relationship with one another. 

When it’s time to put those thoughts into written text, commas used with coordinating conjunctions help us indicate the relationships among our thoughts. They help us avoid the choppy, flat style that comes from every thought becoming a separate separate sentence, walled off from other sentences with the finality of a period:

'''Example of periodic text:''' ''Building consensus ends with synthesis. It begins with analysis. Of course, the ultimate goal is finding commonality. The final product is a single course of action. However, a consensus derives validity only from agreement among the many. The first step in reaching consensus is to survey the different viewpoints involved.''

If we add commas with coordinating conjunctions to this group of sentences, our reader will be able to see more clearly the relationships that exist among the complete thoughts:

'''The same text with commas and coordinating conjunctions:''' ''Building consensus ends with synthesis, '''but''' it begins with analysis. Of course, the ultimate goal is finding commonality&lt;b&gt;, and &lt;/b&gt; the final product is a single course of action. However, a consensus derives validity only from agreement among the many&lt;b&gt;, so &lt;/b&gt; the first step in reaching consensus is to survey the different viewpoints involved.''

=== The formula ===

Use a comma to join two independent clauses (IC) with a coordinating conjunction (CC). Place the comma before the coordinating conjunction.

'''IC, CC IC.'''

Coordinating Conjunctions--For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet and So--are often referred to by the mnemonic device used to memorize them: FANBOYS

=== Errors ===

A comma and a coordinating conjunction must appear together in order to have enough “strength” to join two independent clauses. These errors happen when one or the other is missing:

Two independent clauses joined by just a coordinating conjunction (no comma) or joined by nothing at all -- they just collide --  is called a '''run-on sentence''' or sometimes a '''fused sentence'''.

'''Examples of run-on or fused sentences:'''
* ''Several environmental organizations recognized the treaty but few endorsed it.''
* ''Internet communities redefine the notion of space they take the concept beyond physical dimensions.''

Two independent clauses joined by just a comma (no coordinating conjunction) is called a '''comma splice'''.

'''Example of a comma splice:''' ''Economists predicted lower personal debt loads resulting from tax cuts, this did not happen.''

== Commas with introductory words and phrases ==

Another relationship between thoughts we signal to our readers is that of '''introduction'''. We often want to give our readers some background before laying out our main thought, or we want to give some information first that limits or otherwise modifies the information in our main thought. Introductory elements can be one word or several so long as they do not contain a finite verb. An introductory element that includes a finite verb is likely to be a clause instead. Common ones are '''transition words''' and '''statements about time, place, manner, or condition'''.

Using a comma after an introductory element requires your reader to pause, and so should only be done with good reason. 

===Introductory Words ===

Introductory words are set off with a comma when the introductory word is a participle, modifies the entire clause following it, or when not including it might lead to misreading.

'''Examples of sentences with introductory words:'''
* ''Humiliated, she fled from the diner.'' (participle)
* ''Moreover, several groups actively opposed the treaty.'' (modifies entire clause)
* ''Inside, traders shouted orders out.'' (''Inside Traders'' would be ambiguous)
* ''Quickly tie your shoe'' (''Quickly'' is a simple adverb, it only modifies ''tie.'')

===Introductory Phrases ===

Introductory phrases are not set off with a comma without good reason. Phrases that contain verbals, absolute phrases, long prepositional phrases, or compound prepositional phrase are set off. Short prepositional phrases are only set off for purposes of emphasis. Phrases that show inversion in sentence structure can also be followed by a comma.

'''Examples of sentences with introductory phrases:'''
* ''Calling in sick for work, Beth hoped her boss would not suspect anything.'' (Phrase contains a verbal)
* ''The stock market falling in Tokyo, Alex called his stock broker.'' (Absolute phrase)
* ''Beneath the antique wooden fishing boat, barnacles had grown for years.'' (Long introductory phrase, but even here the comma is optional.)
* ''Underneath the noses of her parents, Ruth had hoarded three kilograms of cocaine.'' (Compound prepositional phrase)
* ''In a cold sweat, Henry read the letter addressed to his wife.'' (emphasis)
* ''Drunk and angry, Joel burst into the room.'' (inverted structure)
* ''After school I went to my uncle's house.'' (short prepositional phrase)
* ''Before the parade I want to eat pizza.'' (short prepositional phrase)
* ''By the earthen hearth my mother read to me from the book of Acts.'' (short prepositional phrase)

== Commas with cumulative clauses ==

Another type of relationship between ideas that we signal to readers with a comma is that of '''accumulation'''. Occurring at the end of a sentence, '''cumulative clauses''' hook up to a main clause and add further information. Using cumulative clauses is a good way to avoid having to use two sentences when one will do.

'''Examples of sentences with cumulative clauses:'''
* ''Nine senators changed their vote, passing the bill into law.''
* ''Three years of above-average rainfall raised the water table, turning formerly usable fields into wetlands.''
* ''Peers frequently reinforce the behavior, leading it to become an ingrained habit.''

== Commas and dependent clauses ==
Remember, when you read a '''dependent clause''' aloud, you or your listener has the feeling of “Well...? What’s next? Finish it up!” A dependent clause is a group of words that can’t stand on its own as a sentence because it does not express a complete thought. It leaves the listener (and reader) hanging.

'''Examples of dependent clauses:'''
* ''although psychology and applied psychology are separate disciplines''
* ''when sanctions proved too difficult to enforce''
* ''because it was undated''

Dependent clauses, as their name implies, &quot;depend&quot; on another clause to form a complete sentence. Dependent clauses must be paired with independent clauses. 

=== The formula ===

When the dependent clause comes before the independent clause, use a comma after the dependent clause.
: '''DC, IC.'''

When the dependent clause comes after the independent clause, just run right through without a comma.
: '''IC DC.'''

'''Examples:'''
* ''Although psychology and applied psychology are separate disciplines, they both are relatively recent additions to the university.''
* ''The U.N. approved military action when sanctions proved too difficult to enforce.''
* ''Archaeologists used contextual clues to date the manuscript because it was undated.''

=== Errors ===

A '''disruptive comma''' is one used before a dependent clause that comes after the independent clause. Writers often make this mistake when the dependent clause begins with because.

'''Examples of disruptive commas:'''
* ''The future of print newspapers appears uncertain, due to rising production costs and the increasing popularity of online news sources.''
* ''Some argue that print newspapers will never disappear, because of their many readers.''

== Commas and restrictive modifiers ==

You know what it's like to talk to someone and add explanations as you go, even right in the middle of your thoughts, to make sure your listener knows exactly which things you are talking about? When those explanantions show up in a written sentence, they are called '''modifiers'''. Modifiers can be '''nonrestrictive''' -- meaning that you can drop them out of a sentence and you won't change the meaning. '''Restrictive''' modifiers are ones whose meaning is essential to the overall meaning of the sentence; if you dropped a restrictive modifier, the meaning of the sentence would change.

'''Use a pair of commas to set off a nonrestrictive clause. Don't use commas around restrictive clauses.'''

'''Examples:'''
* ''The committee, headed by Dr. Suarez, met weekly to develop a budget.''
*: In this sentence, the phrase &quot;headed by Dr. Suarez&quot; is nonessential to the meaning of the main clause, which is that the committee met weekly. Presumably only one committee has been under discussion in previous sentences. However, if the discussion is of several committees, and the writer wants to point out that it was that one specific committee headed by Dr. Suarez that met weekly, the commas would be removed:
* ''The committee headed by Dr. Suarez met weekly to develop a budget.''
* ''Employees who participate in the company's fitness classes pay a lower health insurance premium.''
*: Here, no commas are used, since it is not just any and all employees who pay a lower health premium, but only those who participate in the company's fitness program. Notice the difference in the next sentence, in which the nonrestrictive modifier adds information but wouldn't change the meaning if it was taken out:
* ''Employees, who have access to the company's gym and fitness classes, are encouraged to practice preventive healthcare. ''

== Commas and parenthetical elements ==

Much like a nonrestrictive modifier, a parenthetical expression provides extra information or commentary in the middle of a sentence. A parenthetical element, however, often sounds more obviously &quot;speech-like&quot; and interjectory. Use a pair of commas to set off a parenthetical element.

'''Examples:'''
* ''The candidate, much to the committee's surprise, voluntarily revealed her positions on several key controversies.''
* ''The question has, incidentally, since become moot.''

== Commas with multiple adjectives ==

When you use more than one descriptive word (adjective) to describe something (a noun), ask yourself whether the adjectives work independently to describe the noun, or if they build on each other and work together to describe the noun. 

One way to tell is to reverse the order of the adjectives. If you can reverse the order and the meaning stays the same, the adjectives are working independently and should be separated by a comma. If you reverse the order and it doesn't make sense, the adjectives are working together and should not be separated by a comma. 

Another test is to put &quot;and&quot; between the adjectives. If you can do that and retain the meaning, the adjectives are working independently and need a comma between them. If inserting &quot;and&quot; between the adjectives changes the meaning, the adjectives are working together and shouldn't be separated from each other by a comma. 

'''If multiple adjectives before a noun work independently, use a comma between them. If they work together, don't.'''
   
'''Examples of adjectives working independently:'''
* ''An open, exploratory, and inclusive spirit marked the meeting.''
*: '''Test:''' ''An open '''and''' exploratory '''and''' inclusive spirit marked the meeting.''
* ''A direct, conversational tone made the instructions easy to understand.''
*: '''Test:''' ''A conversational, direct tone made the instructions easy to understand.''

'''Examples of adjectives working together:'''
* ''Local health officials recently released guidelines for dealing with avian flu outbreaks.''
*: '''Test:''' ''Health local officials recently released guidelines for dealing with flu avian outbreaks.'' '''Do not use commas.'''
* ''An extruded plastic stem keeps the component stable.''
*: '''Test:''' ''An extruded '''and''' plastic stem keeps the component stable.'' '''Do not use a comma.'''

== Commas with quotations ==

Use a comma to set off the '''attribution''' -- the phrase that says who said or wrote a quotation -- from the quotation itself. Notice that the comma goes inside the quotation marks, even if the quotation is a complete sentence and would, if appearing on its own, take a period at the end.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''&quot;The ballot is stronger than the bullet,&quot; writes Abraham Lincoln.''
:* ''&quot;Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly, and applying the wrong remedies,&quot; said Groucho Marx.''

Use a pair of commas to set off the attribution when it appears in the middle of the quotation.
: '''Example:''' ''&quot;In a time of universal deceit,&quot; writes George Orwell, &quot;telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act.&quot;''

Do not replace a question mark or exclamation point in a quotation with a comma.
: '''Example:''' ''&quot;When will our consciences grow so tender that we will act to prevent human misery rather than avenge it?&quot; writes Eleanor Roosevelt.''

Do not use a comma to set off quotations that occupy a subordinate position in a sentence, often signaled by the words '''that''', '''which''', or '''because'''.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''Emphasizing the importance of staying in touch with the populace, James Madison wrote that &quot;a popular government without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or both.&quot;''
:* ''Participating in a democracy takes a strong stomach because &quot;it requires a certain relish for confusion,&quot; writes Molly Ivins.''

== Commas in a list ==

Use commas between items in a list when there are three or more. 

The final comma, the one before &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot;, is known as the Oxford comma, Harvard comma or serial comma. The Oxford comma should always be used where it is needed to avoid confusion (for example where one or more items in the list already include the word &quot;and&quot;). Otherwise it is optional. The Oxford comma is relatively uncommon in British English, except where used to avoid confusion. Not using the Oxford comma is relatively uncommon in American English, except in newspapers and magazines.

'''Examples:'''
* ''Additional supplies required are a burner, beaker(,) and safety goggles.''
* ''The position requires expertise in building consensus, formulating policy(,) and developing long-range goals.''
* ''The English-speaking countries include Dominica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica.''

== Commas in dates, numbers, personal titles, and addresses ==

Use commas to separate the day of the week from month and to set off a year from the rest of the sentence.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''On December 12, 1890, orders for the arrest of Sitting Bull were sent.''
:* ''Graduation is set for May 20, 2006.''

You do not need to use a comma when giving only the month and the year.
: '''Example:''' ''The next presidential election will take place in November 2008.''

Use commas to separate number into groups of three when they are more than four digits long. The comma is optional when the number is four digits long.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''2,400 (or 2400)''
:* ''50,000''
:* ''340,000''

Do not use a comma in street addresses or page numbers.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''The table appears on page 1397.''
:* ''The fire occurred at 5509 Avenida Valencia.''

When following a name with a title, use a comma (if the title is at the end of the sentence) or two (if the title is in the middle of the sentence) to separate the title from the rest of the sentence.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''Paul Hjort, D.C., practices chiropractic medicine in central Minnesota.''
:* ''Earnings far exceeded projections last quarter, according to Hitomi Masamura, Vice President for Operations.''

Separate each element of an address is with commas. However, do not use a comma before a ZIP or other postal code.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''Bob Dole grew up in Hope, Kansas.''
:* ''Write to the program advisor at 645 5th Street, Minerton, Indiana 55555.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">People have been around for a long time.  More than four thousand years ago, they were building pyramids in Egypt.  Three thousand years ago, the Zhou dynasty ruled in China, King David sat on the throne in Israel, and the Greeks were fighting a war against Troy. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ and Augustus Caesar were alive.  A thousand years ago, William the Conqueror invaded England.  And just a few dozen years ago, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. 
The fascinating thing about history that by re-telling the past, it teaches us about the present and in doing so, it lays the foundation for our future. Think about that! Everything you see around you every day, every item you use and every word you say has is own unique history. So, on the one hand, history is a linear sequence of events while on the other it is the story that explains why things are they way they are. 

People learn history for many reasons.  You may want to understand how things happen, and why.  You may be interested in the great art or the great scientific discoveries of the past.  You may want to learn the truth behind stories you have heard about Helen of Troy or Romeo and Juliet.  Or you may just want to hear entertaining stories that are true.

How to begin?  One way is to begin at the beginning, with the history of people who lived near river banks, such as the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, the Huanghe Valley and the Nile Valley civilisations.  The trouble with that is that you may grow up and grow old before you ever get to the history that your parents and grandparents lived through.  Some people begin by learning the history of their own land, and leave for later the history of other lands and other peoples.  Some people are only interested in things that are happening now, or in their lifetimes, or in their parents or grandparents lifetimes.  

It seems to me that the best way to learn history is to make several quick passes through history -- like the one you read in the first paragraph of this Wikibook. If you want to know more, you can branch off to study any of the many topics that are lightly covered here.

==Things that are the same; things that are different==

All human beings, in all places and at all times, are born, grow up, and die, we laugh and cry, we sing and dance, we trade, we raise families, we eat and drink, we sleep.  These are things that we have in common with the people of the past.  

But people live in many different ways.  There are times when many people grow old, and other times when most people die young.  There are times when people live in peace, and other times when they are caught up in wars.  Some people hunt, some farm, some work in factories.  Art, music, religion, family life, customs and laws all differ widely from place to place and time to time.  Each culture has its unique forms of expression: the dances of the Bantu peoples, the music of the Beatles. 

==Big changes==

There have been people on earth for more than a million years if, by a person, you mean someone who walks on their hind legs and can make a spear.  The first million years of human existence is sometimes called the stone age.  People spread out over the earth, from the steaming jungles to the frigid north.  A few tens of thousands of years ago, something wonderful happened.  All over the world people began to develop new tools, new forms of art, musical instruments, and began to bury their dead.  Before that time, primitive tools from widely separated places look very much alike.  After that time, human artifacts take on an almost infinite variety of distinctive forms.  This is the age of the cave paintings, of the European drawings of buffalo and the African drawings of antelope.  These works of art differ not only in subject but in style.  This age is called the Neolithic age (or new stone age).  In 2005, scientists isolated two genes that they think may be the cause of this wonderful change, but the discovery is too new for anybody to say for sure.  

Stone age peoples were hunter/gatherers.  They ate animals and what roots and berries they could find growing wild.  There was never enough food, and so people organized into tribes and constantly fought with other tribes.  Many of the bones dug up from this period show signs of wounds from spears or clubs.  Life was, as a writer named Hobbes put it, &quot;nasty, brutish, and short.&quot;

==Banding Together== 

The next big change came about ten thousand years ago, when some people learned to farm.  You need a lot of water to farm, and the first farms were along the banks of rivers.  Farmers also tamed animals, and used them for milk and food, and their skins for shelter and clothing.  The start of farming is called the agricultural revolution.

These farmers were the first people to invent writing; the earliest writing comes down to us from this period.  It is mostly very practical writing -- lists of trade goods, tax records, and laws.  There are also religious books, and stories.  One of the earliest stories is the story of Gilgamesh.

These farmers were surrounded by people who still lived as hunter/gatherers, and there was constant warfare between the two groups.  Farmers organized into city states, and then into empires.  They called the hunter/gatherers &quot;barbarians&quot;.  When the city states and empires were not fighting off invasions by barbarians, city would fight city, empire would fight empire.  There was seldom enough food to go around, a problem made worse by war, disease, insects, and drought.  Still, farming could support many more people than hunting, and the number of people grew rapidly all over the earth, until it soon reached the limit that farming could support.  Many of these farming people, of all races and in all lands, captured slaves in battle and forced them to work the land.  Life was hard.  The men must plow and sow and reap.  A woman's life was even harder, spinning, weaving, sewing, preparing the food, and looking after the children.  There was a saying, &quot;A man must work from sun to sun, but a woman's work is never done.&quot;  The children had to work, too, and many children died young.  A woman would often have a dozen children, and many women died giving birth.

For a few people, life was not so hard.  People who were stronger, or were natural leaders, or were smarter, or maybe just lucky, set themselves up as kings, and took for themselves and their families the lion's share of everything.  Sometimes, the kings enjoyed art, music, and philosophy, and would provide for people who could write or draw or sing or make interesting conversation.  Most kings were interested in hunting and fighting.  And most people were farmers.  They were born, and worked all their lives, and died within a few miles of the place they were born.  They knew nothing about the wider world.  Still, they sang and danced at harvest time, prayed to their gods for rain, held festivals and fairs at which traders could offer their wares.  Traders were a special class; they were almost the only people who traveled and who knew something of the wider world.

This is how people lived for thousands of years.  The history of these times is almost exclusively a history of kings and the wars they fought.  A few great works of art were created that have survived: The Iliad and The Odyssey, the Analects of Confucius, the Tao Te Ching, religious books such as The Bible and the Koran, the plays of the ancient Greeks, the laws and letters of the ancient Romans, the mathematics of Euclid, Archimedes, and Brahamagupta, the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, the history of Heroditous and Thucidides.  And there are the great works of stone and marble: the pyramids, the sphinx, the Parthenon, the Colosseum, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, the Alhambra. 

But most of the famous names of history are famous kings and warriors: Ashurbanipal, Nebuchadnezzar, Agamemnon, David, Alexander, Caesar, Chandragupta ... the list is endless. 

In various places and at various times, science made a fitful beginning in advancing our understanding of nature.  The Greek scientist Eratosthenes discovered the size of the earth.  A Chinese scientist whose name has not come down to us invented gunpowder.  In India, a mathematician invented a marvelous new number system, called the Base Ten numbers, which spread across the entire world.  But these scientists lived and died and the people returned to superstition and forgot what had been learned.  

==The Beginnings of the Modern Age==
That changed about five hundred years ago, in Europe, in a period called the Renaissance.  Human life began to change, and change dramatically.  Beginning with a Polish scientist, Nicholas Copernicus, in 1543, modern science grew to a point where it was self sustaining.  No nation without science could successfully compete with a nation that knew science, and mankind entered the scientific age.  This change is called the industrial revolution.  The majority of people were still, as always, ignorant and superstitious, but governments were usually careful to nurture scientists, because of the wonderful inventions they could make.

People flocked to cities to work in factories.  While in earlier ages most people lived in the country, working on farms, today most people live in cities.  At first, industrial cities were crowded, dirty, and disease ridden.  In London, the skies were black with soot, and after working for twelve hours in a factory, the people would crowded into bars, called gin mills, to spend their hard earned coins and drink themselves into a stupor -- it was the only way they could sleep amid the stench and the crowds.  Children had to work, too, and the gin mills had steps that small children could climb to exchange their hard earned coins for a shot of gin.  If the cities were such horrible places, why did people flock to them in such numbers?  Because it beat farming.

Then several things began to happen.  The number of people that modern farms could feed was  much greater than the number that the old style of farming could provide for.  Also, as the science of medicine began to cure diseases, people began to live longer, and fewer babies died.  The population began to explode.

==How Things are Today==
Today, the people of the world are divided into two groups, the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot;.  The rich nations use new inventions to produce great wealth, and the people who live in these countries have decided to have fewer children, so there is more to go around.  The poor nations have less technology, people have many children, and there is never enough to go around.  

Very gradually, things are getting better.  For the first time since the age of science began, the rate of population growth is beginning to slow, and each year there are fewer starving people in the world.

Not everyone likes all of these new things, however.  Many people yearn for the days when each generation lived in the same way that their ancestors did.

Notice how change is getting quicker and quicker.  The stone age lasted more than a million years.  The Neolithic age lasted tens of thousands of years, the agricultural age lasted thousands of years.  The industrial age has, so far, only lasted hundreds of years.  

Some people believe we are on the brink of a new age, the information age, which may change our lives as much as the change from life on a farm to life in a modern city.  Nobody knows what the future holds.

==Religious leaders, philosophers, and scientists==

A wise king can make a difference in the lives of his subjects, and a cruel or stupid king can cause a great deal of suffering, but few kings have any lasting effect on their society.  So much of written history is about kings because kings are powerful enough to make sure their names get written down a lot.

The people who really make a lasting difference are religious leaders, philosophers, and scientists.

Between the building of the pyramids more than four thousand years ago and the Greek attack on Troy about three thousand years ago, one of the world's leading religions began in India.  The Hindu religion has more than 800,000,000 followers, about 90% of them on the Indian subcontinent.  If you want to learn about Hinduism, a good place to start is by reading the Bhagavad Gita, which is a conversation between a man, Prince Arjuna, and his charioteer Lord Krishna, who just before an epic battle reveals himself as, Vishnu, God Incarnate.  

A few hundred years after the Greeks invaded Troy, the Greek poet, Homer, wrote down the story of the Trojan War in two epic poems, The Iliad and The Odyssey.  Greek writers and thinkers treated these two books in much the same way that Christian writers and thinkers draw on the Bible, as a source inspiration.

Midway between the Trojan war and the days of the Caesars, about 400 B.C., several great philosophers and religious leaders lived.  

In China, Kung Fu Tze (sometimes called Confucius) wrote The Analects, one of the most influential books in history.  Confucius taught that respect for order, for family, for authority, and for ancestors was the cornerstone of all right action.  In India, Guatama Buddha taught that the cause of all suffering is desire.  In Greece, the philosopher Plato wrote a number of dialogs which still make delightful reading today, and the philosopher Aristotle became the first person to write down the rules of logical thinking.  Greek speaking people, especially Euclid, in Egypt, and Archimedes, in Sicily, wrote down the foundations of modern science and mathematics, but the people of Europe turned away from science and mathematics and toward religion and superstition.  After age of the Greeks there were no new scientific or mathematical discoveries in Europe for more than a thousand years.

While Augustus Caesar was ruling the Roman Empire, Jesus Christ was born.  We date our calendar from the approximate year of his birth.  Jesus Christ was a Jew, and the Christian religion was based on the Hebrew religion.  The Christian holy book, the Bible, includes two parts.  The Old Testament describes how God created the world, and includes Jewish law, history, philosophy, and song.  The New Testament describes the life of Jesus Christ and his followers.  Jesus summed up his message in these words, in Matthew 22: 37-39, &quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot;

Between the days of the Caesars, and the conquest of England by William the Conqueror, Muhammad founded the religion of Islam.  A follower of Islam is called a Muslim.  The teachings of Muhammad are given in the Koran.  The Five Pillars of Islam are profession of faith, ritual prayer five times each day, fasting during Ramadan, charity given to the needy, and pilgrimage to Mecca.

In the year 1543 of the Common Era, in Poland, Nicholas Copernicus published a book demonstrating that the Earth circles the sun.  This was the beginning of the Age of Science.  Galileo used the telescope to examine the planets of the solar system; Isaac Newton invented the mathematics called calculus, and was the father of modern physics; Charles Darwin spent many years traveling around the world, observing nature, and discovered evolution; Albert Einstein defined relativity and discovered the photoelectric effect.

Science, democracy, and capitalism remade the world into a place far richer that it had ever been before, richer in material goods, in knowledge, in health, in art, and in ideas.

==When your grandparents were young==

The best way to learn history is to talk to people who are older than you. Many people love to talk about when they were young. When you read about the past in a history book, it can be hard to remember that real people lived through all of those famous events. By talking to someone about their life you can hear what happened in history first hand!

== Introduction ==
It is now time to build on everything that has been established so far.  While it is unlikely that you are going to be using MS-DOS for a major application, it is a good operating system to demonstrate a number of ideas related to software access of the 8250 UART and driver development. Compared to modern operating systems like Linux, OS-X, or Windows, MS-DOS can hardly be called an operating system at all.  All it really offers is basic access to the hard drive and a few minor utilities.  That really doesn't matter so much for what we are dealing with here, and it is a good chance to see how we can directly manipulate the UART to get the full functionality of all aspects of the computer.  The tools I'm using are all available for free (as in beer) and can be used in emulator software (like VMware or Bochs) to try these ideas out as well.  Emulation of serial devices is generally a weak point for these programs, so it may work easier if you work from a floppy boot of DOS, or on an older computer that is otherwise destined for the trash can because it is obsolete.

For Pascal, you can look here:

*Turbo Pascal [http://bdn.borland.com/article/0,1410,20803,00.html] version 5.5 - This is the software I'm actually using for these examples, and the compiler that most older documentation on the web will also support (generally).

*Free Pascal [http://www.freepascal.org/] - *note* this is a 32-bit version, although there is a port for DOS development.  Unlike Turbo Pascal, it also has ongoing development and is more valuable for serious projects running in DOS.

For MS-DOS substitution (if you don't happen to have MS-DOS 6.22 somewhere):

*FreeDOS [http://www.freedos.org/] Project - Now that Microsoft has abandoned development of DOS, this is pretty much the only OS left that is pure command line driven and following the DOS architecture.

== '''Hello World''', Serial Data Version ==

In the [[Programming:Serial Data Communications#Intended Audience|introduction]], I mentioned that it was very difficult to write computer software that implements RS-232 serial communications.  A very short program shows that at least a basic program really isn't that hard at all.  In fact, just three more lines than a typical &quot;Hello World&quot; program.

 program HelloSerial;
 var
   DataFile: Text;
 begin
   Assign(DataFile,'COM1');
   Rewrite(DataFile);
   Writeln(DataFile,'Hello World');
   Close(DataFile);
 end.

All of this works because in DOS (and all version of Windows as well... on this particular point) has a &quot;reserved&quot; file name called COM1 that is the operating system hooks into the serial communications ports.  While this seems simple, it is deceptively simple.  You still don't have access to being able to control the baud rate or any of the other settings for the modem.  That is a fairly simple thing to add, however, using the knowledge of the UART discussed in the previous chapter [[Serial Programming:8250 UART Programming|Programming the 8250 UART]].

To try something even easier, you don't even need a compiler at all.  This takes advantage of the reserved &quot;device names&quot; in DOS and can be done from the command prompt.

 C:\&gt;COPY CON COM1

What you are doing here is taking input from ''CON'' (the console or the standard keyboard you use on your computer) and it &quot;copies&quot; the data to ''COM1''.  You can also use variations of this to do some interesting file transfers, but it has some important limitations.  Most importantly, you don't have access to the UART settings, and this simply uses whatever the default settings of the UART might be, or what you used last time you changed the settings to become with a serial terminal program.

== Finding the Port I/O Address for the UART ==

The next big task that we have to work with is trying to find the base &quot;address&quot; of the Port I/O so that we can communicate with the UART chip directly (see the part about interface logic in the [[Serial_Programming:Typical_RS232-Hardware_Configuration|Typical RS232-Hardware Configuration]] module for information what this is about).  For a &quot;typical&quot; PC system, the following are usually the addresses that you need to work with:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Serial Port Name !! Base I/O Port Address !! IRQ (interrupt) Number
|-
| COM1 || 3F8 || 4
|-
| COM2 || 2F8 || 3
|-
| COM3 || 3E8 || 4
|-
| COM4 || 2E8 || 3
|}

=== Looking up UART Base Address in RAM ===

We will get back to the issue of the IRQ Number in a little bit, but for now we need to know where to start accessing information about each UART.  As demonstrated previously, DOS also keeps track of where the UART IO ports are located at for its own purpose, so you can try to &quot;look up&quot; within the memory tables that DOS uses to try and find the correct address as well.  This doesn't always work, because we are going outside of the normal DOS API structure.  Alternative operating systems ( FreeDOS works fine here ) that are otherwise compatible with MS-DOS may not work in this manner, so take note that this may simply give you a wrong result altogether.

The addresses for the serial I/O Ports can be found at the following locations in RAM:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Port !! Segment !! Offset
|-
| COM1 || $0040 || $0000
|-
| COM2 || $0040 || $0002
|-
| COM3 || $0040 || $0004
|-
| COM4 || $0040 || $0006
|}


Those addresses are written to memory by the BIOS when it boots. If one of the ports doesn't exist, the BIOS writes zero to the respective address. Note that the addresses are given in segment:offset format and that you have to multiply the address of the segment with 16 and add the offset to get to the physical address in memory.  This is where DOS &quot;finds&quot; the port addresses so you can run the first sample program in this chapter.

In assembler you can get the addresses like this: 

&lt;pre&gt;
; Data Segment
.data
Port  dw 0
...

; Code Segment
.code
mov ax,40h
mov es,ax
mov si,0
mov bx,Port ; 0 - COM1 , 1 - COM2 ...
shl bx,1
mov Port, es:[si+bx]
&lt;/pre&gt;

In Turbo Pascal, you can get at these addresses almost the same way and in some ways even easier because it is a &quot;high level language&quot;.  All you have to do is add the following line to access the COM Port location as a simple array:

 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;

The reserved, non standard, word '''absolute''' is a flag to the compiler that instead of &quot;allocating&quot; memory, that you already have a place in mind to have the computer look instead.  This is something that should seldom be done by a programmer unless you are accessing things like these I/O port addresses that are always stored in this memory location.

For a complete program that simply prints out a table of the I/O port addresses for all four standard COM ports, you can use this simple program:

 program UARTLook;
 const
   HexDigits: array [$0..$F] of Char = '0123456789ABCDEF';
 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;
   Index: Integer;
 function HexWord(Number:Word):String;
 begin
   HexWord := '$' + HexDigits[Hi(Number) shr 4] +
                    HexDigits[Hi(Number) and $F] +
                    HexDigits[Lo(Number) shr 4] +
                    HexDigits[Lo(Number) and $F];
 end;
 begin
   writeln('Serial COMport I/O Port addresses:');
   for Index := 1 to 4 do begin
     writeln('COM',Index,' is located at ',HexWord(ComPort[Index]));
   end;
 end.

=== Searching BIOS Setup ===

Assuming that the standard I/O addresses don't seem to be working for your computer and you haven't been able to find the correct I/O Port offset addresses through searching RAM either, all hope is still not lost.  Assuming that you have not accidentally changed these settings earlier, you can also try to look up these numbers in the BIOS setup page for your computer.  It may take some pushing around to find this information, but if you have a conventional serial data port on your computer, it will be there.

If you are using a serial data port that is connected via USB (common on more recent computers), you are simply not going to be (easily) able to do direct serial data communications in DOS.  Instead, you need to use more advanced operating systems like Windows or Linux that is beyond the scope of this chapter.  We will cover how to access the serial communications routines in those operating systems in subsequent chapters.  The basic principles we are discussing here would still be useful to review because it goes into the basic UART structure.

While it may be useful to try and make IRQs selectable and not presume that the information listed above is correct in all situations, it is important to note that most PC-compatible computer equipment usually has these IRQs and I/O port addresses used in this way because of legacy support.  And surprisingly as computers get more sophisticated with even more advanced equipment like USB devices, these legacy connections still work for most equipment.

== Making modifications to UART Registers ==

Now that we know where to look in memory to modify the UART registers, let's put that knowledge to work.  We are also now going to do some practical application of the tables listed earlier in the chapter [[Serial Programming:8250 UART Programming|8250 UART Programming]].

To start with, let's redo the previous &quot;Hello World&quot; application, but this time we are going to set the RS-232 transmission parameters to 1200 baud, 7 databits, even parity, and 2 stop bits.  I'm choosing this setting parameter because it is not standard for most modem applications, as a demonstration.  If you can change these settings, then other transmission settings are going to be trivial.

First, we need to set up some software constants to keep track of locations in memory.  This is mainly to keep things clear to somebody trying to make changes to our software in the future, not because the compiler needs it.

 const
   LCR = 3;
   Latch_Low = $00;
   Latch_High = $01;

Next, we need to set the DLAB to a logical &quot;1&quot; so we can set the baud rate:

 Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $80;

In this case, we are ignoring the rest of the settings for the Line Control Register (LCR) because we will be setting them up in a little bit.  Remember this is just a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; way to get this done for now.  A more &quot;formal&quot; way to set up things like baud rate will be demonstrated later on with this module.

Following this, we need to put in the baud rate for the modem.  Looking up 1200 baud on the [[Serial Programming:8250 UART Programming#Divisor Latch Bytes|Divisor Latch Bytes table]] gives us the following values:

 Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_High] := $00;
 Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_Low] := $60;

Now we need to set the values for the LCR based on our desired setting of 7-2-E for the communication settings.  We also need to &quot;clear&quot; the DLAB which we can also do at the same time.
 
 Clearing DLAB = 0 * 128
 Clearing &quot;Set Break&quot; flag = 0 * 64
 Even Parity = 2 * 8
 Two Stop bits = 1 * 4
 7 Data bits = 2 * 1

 Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $16  {8*2 + 4 + 2 = 22 or $16 in hex}

Are things clear so far?  What we have just done is some bit-wise arithmetic, and I'm trying to keep things very simple here and to try and explain each step in detail.  Let's just put the whole thing together as the quick and dirty &quot;Hello World&quot;, but with adjustment of the transmission settings as well:

 program HelloSerial;
 const
   LCR = 3;
   Latch_Low = $00;
   Latch_High = $01;
 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;
   DataFile: Text;
 begin
   Assign(DataFile,'COM1');
   Rewrite(DataFile);
   {Change UART Settings}
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $80;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_High] := $00;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_Low] := $60;
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $16
   Writeln(DataFile,'Hello World');
   Close(DataFile);
 end.

This is getting a little more complicated, but not too much.  Still, all we have done so far is just write data out to the serial port.  Reading data from the serial data port is going to be a little bit trickier.

== Basic Serial Input ==

In theory, you could use a standard I/O library and simply read data from the COM port like you would be reading from a file on your hard drive.  Something like this:

 Readln(DataFile,SomeSerialData);

There are some problems with doing that with most software, however.  One thing to keep in mind is that using a standard input routine will stop your software until the input is finished ending with a &quot;Enter&quot; character (ASCII code 13 or in hex $0D).  

Usually what you want to do with a program that receives serial data is to allow the user to do other things while the software is waiting for the data input.  In a multitasking operating system, this would simply be put on another &quot;thread&quot;, but with this being DOS, we don't (usually) have threading capabilities, nor is it necessary.  There are some other alternatives that we do in order to get the serial data brought into your software.

=== Polling the UART ===

Perhaps the easiest to go, besides simply letting the standard I/O routines grab the input) is to do software polling of the UART.  One of the reasons why this works is because serial communications is generally so slow compared to the CPU speed that you can perform many tasks in between each character being transmitted to your computer.  Also, we are trying to do practical applications using the UART chip, so this is a good way to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the chip beyond simple output of data.

==== Serial Echo Program ====

Looking at the Line Status Register (LSR), there is a bit called '''Data Ready''' that indicates there is some data available to your software in the UART.  We are going to take advantage of that bit, and start to do data access directly from the UART instead of relying on the standard I/O library.  This program we are going to demonstrate here is going to be called ''Echo'' because all it does is take whatever data is sent to the computer through the serial data port and display it on your screen.  We are also going to be configuring the RS-232 settings to a more normal 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity.  To quit the program, all you have to do is press any key on your keyboard.

 program SerialEcho;
 uses
   Crt;
 const
   RBR = 0;
   LCR = 3;
   LSR = 5;
   Latch_Low = $00;
   Latch_High = $01;
 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;
   InputLetter: Char;
 begin
   Writeln('Serial Data Terminal Character Echo Program.  Press any key on the keyboard to quit.');
   {Change UART Settings}
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $80;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_High] := $00;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_Low] := $0C;
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $03;
   {Scan for serial data}
   while not KeyPressed do begin
     if (Port[ComPort[1] + LSR] and $01) &gt; 0 then begin
       InputLetter := Chr(Port[ComPort[1] + RBR]);
       Write(InputLetter);
     end; {if}
   end; {while}
 end.

==== Simple Terminal ====

This program really isn't that complicated.  In fact, a very simple &quot;terminal&quot; program can be adapted from this to allow both sending and receiving characters.  In this case, the ''Escape'' key will be used to quit the program, which will in fact be where most of the changes to the program will happen.  We are also introducing for the first time direct output into the UART instead of going through the standard I/O libraries with this line:

 Port[ComPort[1] + THR] := Ord(OutputLetter); 

The Transmit Holding Register (THR) is how data you want to transmit gets into the UART in the first place.  DOS just took care of the details earlier, so now we don't need to open a &quot;file&quot; in order to send data.  We are going to assume, to keep things very simple, that you can't type at 9600 baud, or roughly 11,000 words per minute.  Only if you are dealing with very slow baud rates like 110 baud is that going to be an issue anyway (still at over 130 words per minute of typing... a very fast typist indeed).

 program SimpleTerminal;
 uses
   Crt;
 const
   THR = 0;
   RBR = 0;
   LCR = 3;
   LSR = 5;
   Latch_Low = $00;
   Latch_High = $01;
   {Character Constants}
   NullLetter = #0;
   EscapeKey = #27;
 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;
   InputLetter: Char;
   OutputLetter: Char;
 begin
   Writeln('Simple Serial Data Terminal Program.  Press &quot;Esc&quot; to quit.');
   {Change UART Settings}
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $80;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_High] := $00;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_Low] := $0C;
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $03;
   {Scan for serial data}
   OutputLetter := NullLetter;
   repeat
     if (Port[ComPort[1] + LSR] and $01) &gt; 0 then begin
       InputLetter := Chr(Port[ComPort[1] + RBR]);
       Write(InputLetter);
     end; {if}
     if KeyPressed then begin
       OutputLetter := ReadKey;
       Port[ComPort[1] + THR] := Ord(OutputLetter); 
     end; {if}
   until OutputLetter = EscapeKey;
 end.

== Interrupt Drivers in DOS ==

The software polling method may be adequate for most simple tasks, and if you want to test some serial data concepts without writing a lot of software, it may be sufficient.  Quite a bit can be done with just that method of data input.

When you are writing a more complete piece of software, however, it becomes important to worry about the efficiency of your software.  While the computer is &quot;polling&quot; the UART to see if a character has been sent through the serial communications port, it spends quite a few CPU cycles doing absolutely nothing at all.  It also get very difficult to expand a program like the one demonstrated above to become a small section of a very large program.  If you want to get that last little bit of CPU performance out of your software, we need to turn to interrupt drivers and how you can write them.

I'll openly admit that this is a tough leap in complexity from a simple polling application listed above, but it is an important programming topic in general.  We are also going to expose a little bit about the low-level behavior of the 8086 chip family, which is knowledge you can use in newer operating systems as well, at least for background information.

Going back to earlier discussions about the 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) chip, external devices like the UART can &quot;signal&quot; the 8086 that an important task needs to occur that '''interrupts''' the flow of the software currently running on the computer.  Not all computers do this, however, and sometimes the software polling of devices is the only way to get data input from other devices.  The real advantage of interrupt events is that you can process data acquisition from devices like the UART very quickly, and CPU time spent trying to test if there is data available can instead be used for other tasks.  It is also useful when designing operating systems that are ''event driven''.

Interrupt Requests (IRQs) are labeled with the names IRQ0 to IRQ15.  UART chips typically use either IRQ 3 or IRQ 4.  When the PIC signals to the CPU that an interrupt has occurred, the CPU automatically start to run a very small subroutine that has been previously setup in the '''Interrupt Table''' in RAM.  The exact routine that is started depends on which IRQ has been triggered.  What we are going to demonstrate here is the ability to write our own software that &quot;takes over&quot; from the operating system what should occur when the interrupt occurs.  In effect, writing our own &quot;operating system&quot; instead, at least for those parts we are rewriting.

Indeed, this is exactly what operating system authors do when they try to make a new OS... deal with the interrupts and write the subroutines necessary to control the devices connected to the computer.

The following is a very simple program that captures the keyboard interrupt and produces a &quot;clicking&quot; sound in the speaker as you type each key.  One interesting thing about this whole section, while it is moving slightly off topic, this is communicating with a serial device.  The keyboard on a typical PC transmits the information about each key that you press through a RS-232 serial protocol that operates usually between 300 and 1200 baud and has its own custom UART chip.  Normally this isn't something you are going to address, and seldom are you going to have another kind of device connected to the keyboard port, but it is interesting that you can &quot;hack&quot; into the functions of your keyboard by understanding serial data programming.

 program KeyboardDemo;
 uses
   Dos, Crt;
 const
   EscapeKey = #27;
 var
   OldKeybrdVector: Procedure;
 {$F+}
 procedure Keyclick; interrupt;
 begin
   if Port[$60] &lt; $80 then begin
     Sound(5000);
     Delay(1);
     Nosound;
   end;
   inline($9C) { PUSHF - Push the flags onto the stack }
   OldKeybrdVector;
 end;
 {$F-}
 begin
   GetIntVec($9,@OldKeybrdVector);
   SetIntVec($9,Addr(Keyclick));
   repeat
    if KeyPressed then begin
      OutputLetter := ReadKey;
      Write(OutputLetter);
    end; {if}
   until OutputLetter = EscapeKey;
   SetIntVec($9,@OldKeybrdVector);
 end.

There are a number of things that this program does, and we need to explore the realm of 16-bit DOS software as well.  The 8086 chip designers had to make quite a few compromises in order to work with the computer technology that was available at the time it was designed.  Computer memory was quite expensive compared to the overall cost of the computer.  Most of the early microcomputers that the IBM-PC was competing against only had 64K or 128K of main CPU RAM anyway, so huge programs were not considered important.  In fact, the original IBM-PC was designed to operate on only 128K of RAM although it did become standard with generally up to 640K of main RAM, especially by the time the IBM PC-XT was released and the market for PC &quot;clones&quot; turned out what is generally considered the &quot;standard PC&quot; computer today.

The design came up with what is called '''segmented memory''', where the CPU address is made up of a memory &quot;segment&quot; pointer and a 64K block of memory.  That is why some early software on these computers could only run in 64K of memory, and created nightmares for compiler authors on the 8086.  Pentium computers don't generally have this issue, as the memory model in &quot;protected mode&quot; doesn't use this segmented design methodology.

=== Far Procedure Calls ===
 
 {$F+}
 {$F-}

This program has two &quot;compiler switches&quot; that inform the compiler of the need to use what are called far procedure calls.  Normally for small programs and simple subroutines, you are able to use what is called relative indexing with the software so the CPU &quot;jumps&quot; to the portion of RAM with the procedure by doing a bit of simple math and &quot;adding&quot; a number to the current CPU address in order to find the correct instructions.  This is done especially because it uses quite a bit less memory to store all of these instructions.

Sometimes, however, a procedure must be accessed from somewhere in RAM that is quite different from the current CPU memory address &quot;instruction pointer&quot;.  Interrupt procedures are one of these, because it doesn't even have to be the same program that is stored in the interrupt vector table.  That brings up the next part to discuss:

=== Interrupt Procedures ===

 procedure Keyclick; interrupt;

The word &quot;interrupt&quot; after this procedure name is a key item here.  This tells the compiler that it must do something a little bit different when organizing this function than how a normal function call behaves.  Typically for most software on the computer, you have a bunch of simple instructions that are then followed by (in assembler) an instruction called:

 RET

This is the mnemonic assembly instruction for return from procedure call.  Interrupts are handled a little bit differently and should normally end with a different CPU instruction that in assembly is called:

 IRET

or Interrupt return for short.  One of the things that should also happen with any interrupt service routine is to &quot;preserve&quot; the CPU information before doing anything else.  Each &quot;command&quot; that you write in your software will modify the internal registers of the CPU.  Keep in mind that an interrupt can occur right in the middle of doing some calculations for another program, like rendering a graphic image or making payroll calculations.  We need to hand onto that information and &quot;restore&quot; those values on all of the CPU registers at the end of our subroutine.  This is usually done by &quot;pushing&quot; all of the register values onto the CPU stack, performing the ISR, and then restoring the CPU registers afterward.

In this case, Turbo Pascal (and other well-written compilers having a compiler flag like this) takes care of these low-level details for you with this simple flag.  If the compiler you are using doesn't have this feature, you will have to add these features &quot;by hand&quot; and explicitly put them into your software.  That doesn't mean the compiler will do everything for you to make an interrupt procedure.  There are more steps to getting this to work still.

=== Procedure Variables ===

 var
   OldKeybrdVector: Procedure;

These instructions are using what is called a procedure variable.  Keep in mind that all software is located in the same memory as variables and other information your software is using.  Essentially, a variable procedure where you don't need to worry about what it does until the software is running, and you can change this variable while your program is running.  This is a powerful concept that is not often used, but it can be used for a number of different things.  In this case we are keeping track of the previous interrupt service routine and &quot;chaining&quot; these routines together.

There are programs called Terminate and Stay Resident (TSRs) that are loaded into your computer.  Some of these are called drivers, and the operating system itself also puts in subroutines to do basic functions.  If you want to &quot;play nice&quot; with all of this other software, the established protocol for making sure everybody gets a chance to review the data in an interrupt is to link each new interrupt subroutine to the previously stored interrupt vector.  When we are done with whatever we want to do with the interrupt, we then let all of the other programs get a chance to used the interrupt as well.  It is also possible that the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) that we just wrote is not the first one in the chain, but instead one that is being called by another ISR.

=== Getting/Setting Interrupt Vectors ===

  GetIntVec($9,@OldKeybrdVector);
  SetIntVec($9,Addr(Keyclick));
  SetIntVec($9,@OldKeybrdVector);

Again, this is Turbo Pascal &quot;hiding&quot; the details in a convenient way.  There is a &quot;vector table&quot; that you can directly access, but this vector table is not always in the same location in RAM.  If instead you go through the BIOS with a software interrupt, you are &quot;guaranteed&quot; that the interrupt vector will be correctly replaced.

=== Hardware Interrupt Table ===

|}

This table gives you a quick glance at some of the things that interrupts are used for, and the interrupt numbers associated with them.  Keep in mind that the IRQ numbers are mainly reference numbers, and that the CPU uses a different set of numbers.  The keyboard IRQ, for example, is IRQ1, but it is numbered as interrupt $09 inside the CPU.

There are also several interrupts that are &quot;generated&quot; by the CPU itself.  While technically hardware interrupts, these are generated by conditions ''within'' the CPU, sometimes based on conditions setup by your software or the operating system.  When we start writing the interrupt service routine for the serial communication ports, we will be using interrupts 11 and 12 ($0B and $0C in hex).  As can be seen, most interrupts are assigned for specific tasks.  I've omitted the software interrupts mainly to keep this on topic regarding serial programming and hardware interrupts.

=== Other features ===

There are several other parts to this program that don't need too much more explanation.  Remember, we are talking about serial programming, not interrupt drivers.  I/O Port $60 is interesting as this is the Receiver Buffer (RBR) for the keyboard UART.  This returns the keyboard &quot;scan code&quot;, not the actual character pressed.  In fact, when you use a keyboard on a PC, the keyboard actually transmits two characters for each key that you use.  One character is transmitted when you press the key down, and another character when the key is &quot;released&quot; to go back up.  In this case, the interrupt service routine in DOS normally converts the scan codes into ASCII codes that your software can use.  In fact, simple keys like the shift key are treated as just another scan code.

The sound routines access the internal PC speaker, not something on a sound card.  About the only thing that uses this speaker any more is the BIOS &quot;beep codes&quot; that you hear only when there is a hardware failure to your computer, or the quick &quot;beep&quot; when you start or reboot the computer.  It was never designed for doing things like speech synthesis or music playback, and driver attempts to use it for those purposes sound awful.  Still, it is something neat to experiment with and a legacy computer part that is surprisingly still used on many current computers..

== Terminal Program Revisited ==

I'm going to go back to the serial terminal program for a bit and this time redo the application by using an interrupt service routine.  There are a few other concepts I'd like to introduce as well so I'll try to put them in with this example program.  From the user perspective, I would like to add the ability to change the terminal characteristics from the command line and allow an &quot;end-user&quot; the ability to change things like the baud rate, stop bits, and parity checking, and allow these to be variables instead of hard-coded constants.  I'll explain each section and then put it all together when we are through.

=== Serial ISR ===

This is an example of a serial ISR we can use:

 {$F+}
 procedure SerialDataIn; interrupt;
 var
  InputLetter: Char;
 begin     
   if (Port[ComPort[1] + LSR] and $01) &gt; 0 then begin
     InputLetter := Chr(Port[ComPort[1] + RBR]);
  end; {if}
 end;
 {$F-}

This isn't that much different from the polling method that we used earlier, but keep in mind that by placing the checking inside an ISR that the CPU is only doing the check when there is a piece of data available.  Why even check the LSR to see if there is a data byte available?  Reading data sent to the UART is not the only reason why the UART will invoke an interrupt.  We will go over that in detail in a later section, but for now this is good programming practice as well, to confirm that the data is in there.

By moving this checking to the ISR, more CPU time is available for performing other tasks.  We could even put the keyboard polling into an ISR as well, but we are going to keep things very simple for now.

=== FIFO disabling ===

There is one minor problem with the way we have written this ISR.  We are assuming that there is no FIFO in the UART.  The &quot;bug&quot; that could happen with this ISR as it is currently written is that multiple characters can be in the FIFO buffer.  Normally when this happens, the UART only sends a single interrupt, and it is up to the ISR to &quot;empty&quot; the FIFO buffer completely.

Instead, all we are going to do is simply disable the FIFO completely.  This can be done using the FCR (FIFO Control Register) and explicitly disabling the FIFO.  As an added precaution, we are also going to &quot;clear&quot; the FIFO buffers in the UART as a part of the initialization portion of the program.  Clearing the FIFOs look like this:

  Port[ComPort[1] + FCR] := $07; {clearing the FIFOs}

Disabling the FIFOs look like this:

  Port[ComPort[1] + FCR] := $00; {disabling FIFOs}

We will be using the FIFOs in the next section, so this is more a brief introduction to this register so far.

=== Working with the PIC ===

Up until this point, we didn't have to worry about working with the Programmable Interrupt Controller (the PIC).  Now we need to.  There isn't the need to do all of the potential instructions for the PIC, but we do need to enable and disable the interrupts that are used by the UART.  There are two PICs typically on each PC, but due to the typical UART IRQ vector, we really only have to deal with the master PIC.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Pic Function !! I/O Port Address
|-
| PIC Commands || 0x20
|-
| Interrupt Flags || 0x21
|}

This adds the following two constants into the software:

 {PIC Constants}
 MasterPIC = $20;
 MasterOCW1 = $21;

After consulting the [[Serial Programming:8250 UART Programming#PIC Device Masking|PIC IRQ table]] we need to add the following line to the software in order to enable IRQ4 (used for COM1 typically):

 Port[MasterOCW1] := Port[MasterOCW1] and $EF;

When we do the &quot;cleanup&quot; when the program finishes, we also need to disable this IRQ as well with this line of software:

 Port[MasterOCW1] := Port[MasterOCW1] or $10;

Remember that COM2 is on another IRQ vector, so you will have to use different constants for that IRQ.  That will be demonstrated a little bit later.  We are using a logical and/or with the existing value in this PIC register because we don't want to change the values for the other interrupt vectors that other software and drivers may be using on your PC.

We also need to modify the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) a little bit to work with the PIC.  There is a command you can send to the PIC that is simply called End of Interrupt (EOI).  This signals to the PIC that it can clear this interrupt signal and process lower-priority interrupts.  If you fail to clear the PIC, the interrupt signal will remain and none of the other interrupts that are &quot;lower priority&quot; can be processed by the CPU.  This is how the CPU communicates back to the PIC to end the interrupt cycle.

The following line is added to the ISR to make this happen:

 Port[MasterPIC] := EOI;

=== Modem Control Register ===

This is perhaps the most non-obvious little mistake you can make when trying to get the UART interrupt.  The Modem Control register is really the way for the UART to communicate to the rest of the PC.  Because of the way the circuitry on the motherboards of most computers is designed, you usually have to turn on the Auxiliary Output 2 signal in order for interrupts to &quot;connect&quot; to the CPU.  In addition, here we are going to turn on the RTS and DTS signals on the [[Serial Programming:RS-232 Connections|serial data cable]] to make sure the equipment is going to transmit.  We will cover software and hardware flow control in a later section.

To turn on these values in the MCR, we need to add the following line in the software:

 Port[ComPort[1] + MCR] := $0B;

=== Interrupt Enable Register ===

We are still not home free yet.  We still need to enable interrupts on the UART itself.  This is very simple, and for now all we want to trigger an interrupt from the UART is just when data is received by the UART.  This is a very simple line to add here:

 Port[ComPort[1] + IER] := $01;

=== Putting this together so far ===

Here is the complete program using ISR input:

&lt;pre&gt;
 program ISRTerminal;
 uses
   Crt, Dos;
 const
   {UART Constants}
   THR = 0;
   RBR = 0;
   IER = 1;
   FCR = 2;
   LCR = 3;
   MCR = 4;
   LSR = 5;
   Latch_Low = $00;
   Latch_High = $01;
   {PIC Constants}
   MasterPIC = $20;
   MasterOCW1 = $21;
   {Character Constants}
   NullLetter = #0;
   EscapeKey = #27;
 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;
   OldSerialVector: procedure;
   OutputLetter: Char;
 {$F+}
 procedure SerialDataIn; interrupt;
 var
   InputLetter: Char;
 begin     
   if (Port[ComPort[1] + LSR] and $01) &gt; 0 then begin
     InputLetter := Chr(Port[ComPort[1] + RBR]);
     Write(InputLetter);
   end; {if}
   Port[MasterPIC] := EOI;
 end;
 {$F-}
 begin
   Writeln('Simple Serial ISR Data Terminal Program.  Press &quot;Esc&quot; to quit.');
   {Change UART Settings}
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $80;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_High] := $00;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_Low] := $0C;
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $03;
   Port[ComPort[1] + FCR] := $07; {clearing the FIFOs}
   Port[ComPort[1] + FCR] := $00; {disabling FIFOs}
   Port[ComPort[1] + MCR] := $0B;
   {Setup ISR vectors}
   GetIntVec($0C,@OldSerialVector);
   SetIntVec($0C,Addr(SerialDataIn));
   Port[MasterOCW1] := Port[MasterOCW1] and $EF;
   Port[ComPort[1] + IER] := $01;
   {Scan for keyboard data}
   OutputLetter := NullLetter;
   repeat
     if KeyPressed then begin
       OutputLetter := ReadKey;
       Port[ComPort[1] + THR] := Ord(OutputLetter); 
     end; {if}
   until OutputLetter = EscapeKey;
   {Put the old ISR vector back in}
   SetIntVec($0C,@OldSerialVector);
   Port[MasterOCW1] := Port[MasterOCW1] or $10;
 end.
&lt;/pre&gt;

At this point you start to grasp how complex serial data programming can get.  We are not finished yet, but if you have made it this far you hopefully understand each part of the program listed above.  We are going to try and stay with this one step at a time, but at this point you should be able to write some simple custom software that uses serial I/O.

=== Command Line Input ===

There are a number of different ways that you can &quot;scan&quot; the parameters that start the program.  For example, if you start a simple terminal program in DOS, you can use this command to begin:

 C:&gt; terminal COM1 9600 8 1 None

or perhaps

 C:&gt; terminal COM4 1200 7 2 Even

Obviously there should not be a need to have the end-user recompile the software if they want to change something simple like the baud rate.  What we are trying to accomplish here is to grab those other items that were used to start the program.  In Turbo Pascal, there is function that returns a string

 ParamStr(index)

which contains each item of the command line.  These are passed to the program through strings.  A quick sample program on how to extract these parameters can be found here:

 program ParamTst;
 var
   Index: Integer;
 begin
   writeln('Parameter Test -- displays all command line parameters of this program');
   writeln('Parameter Count = ',ParamCount);
   for Index := 0 to ParamCount do begin
     writeln('Param # ',Index,' - ',ParamStr(Index));
   end;
 end.

One interesting &quot;parameter&quot; is parameter number 0, which is the name of the program that is processing the commands.  We will not be using this parameter, but it is something useful in many other programming situations.

=== Grabbing Terminal Parameters ===

For the sake of simplicity, we are going to require that either all of the parameters are going to be in that format of baud rate, bit size, stop bits, parity; or there will be no parameters at all.  This example is going to be mainly to demonstrate how to use variables to change the settings of the UART by the software user rather than the programmer.  Since the added sections are self-explanatory, I'm just going to give you the complete program.  There will be some string manipulation going on here that is beyond the scope of this book, but that is going to be used only for parsing the commands.  To keep the user interface simple, we are using the command line arguments alone for changing the UART parameters.  We could build a fancy interface to allow these settings to be changed while the program is running, but that is an exercise that is left to the reader.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Family Sponsorship program is designed to allow Canadians to bring members of their family or significant others into the Country. The focus on this application is to prove that the relationship is of an acceptable type and is genuine. 

==Sponsorship Types==
There are several types Family sponsorships. A person may sponsor any of the following people:
* spouse&lt;ref&gt;any marriage recognized by Canadian law&lt;/ref&gt;, common-law partner&lt;ref&gt;must be cohabitating in a conjugal relationship for at least one year&lt;/ref&gt; or conjugal partner&lt;ref&gt;conjugal relationship for over one year with a foriegn national outside of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;.
* parents or grandparents
* dependent children including adopted
* other children who are under the sponsor's guardianship
* orphaned brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, or grandchildren &lt;ref&gt;must be under 18 and not married or in a conjugal relationship&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dependent Children===
Dependent chilren means any child who is either:
* under 22 years, unmarried on the date the application is submitted and is unmarried on date the child lands in Canada; 
* financially dependent on parents due to enrollment and attendance in a full-time educational institution since the age of 22 or since the date of marriage, if married under 22; or
* dependant due to mental or physical disability.

Any interruption in full-time studies for under a year in total will not affect dependant status.

==Eligibility==
Requirements for sponsor:
* over 18 years old
* Permanent Resident or Canadian Citizen
* live in Canada
* income above &quot;Low Income Cut-off&quot; level.&lt;ref&gt;does not apply for sponsoring spouse&lt;/ref&gt;
* not on social assistance except for disability
* not in default on a previous sponsorship
* no in prison 
* not an undischarged bankrupt
* not under a deportation order

==Sponsor's Responsibilities==
Sponsoring is a major committment. For a period of 3 to 10 years, the sponsor is required to, among other things:
* provide the Applicant with basic living requirements and ''essential needs'' where the applicant cannot do so for his or herself.&lt;ref&gt;this includes health, eye care, dental, food, clothing shelter&lt;/ref&gt;
* ensure that Applicant does not have to apply for social assistance

Once the sponsorship has begun it '''cannot be cancelled''' in cases of divorce, separation, or relathionship breakdown. 

===Minimum Threshold income===
The Sponsor must have a minimum income, known as the &quot;Low Income Cut-Off&quot; ''except'' where it is a spousal sponsorship. 

* [http://www.canadavisa.com/documents/cutoff.htm Cut-Off amounts]

===Co-signer===
A co-signer may be used when sponsoring a non-spouse in order to reach the Minimum Income requirement. The co-signer ''must'' be a spouse, common-law partner, or conjugal partner.

==Process==

=== Forms ===
Two sets of forms are needed, those relating to the sponsorship and the standard Permanent Residency forms.

===Documents===
The Sponsor must provide several documents. 

1)  A photocopy of ''one'' of the following:
* Record of Landing 
* Permanent Resident Card (both sides)
* Canadian Citizenship Card (both sides)
* Canadian Birth certificate
* Canadian passport

2) ''One'' of the following:
* An '''Option-C''' tax print out. One can be obtained from a local Revenue Canada Office.
* proof of income.

3) ''original'' '''letter of employment'''.

'''if there is a co-signer'''
* photocopy of '''marriage certificate'''

'''if divorced'''
* photocopy of '''divorce certificate''' 

'''if Applicant is a parent'''
* photocopy of '''birth certificate'''

'''if Sponsoring an adopted child'''
* photocopy of '''adoption order'''

===Inside/Outside Canada===
There are two modes of applying under the family class. A Applicant can be sponsored from inside Canada or from outside Canada. There are separate application Guides for each steam. The big difference between the two is that applications ''inside Canada'' '''cannot be appealed''' if refused. Also, the location and speed at which the application is processed is different, and the method of payment is different. Applications inside Canada can be paid online or with a CIC bank reciept. Applications outside of Canada can be paid online or with an international money order.

===Mailing===
The completed applications of the Sponsor and Applicant the documents, and the payment reciept should be sent to the processing center.&lt;ref&gt; Inside Canada: Vegreville&lt;Br&gt;outside Canada: Missisauga &lt;/ref&gt;

If family status changes, such as marriage, divorce, birth, death, contact address or number, either the sponsor or applicant must call the processing center to inform them of the changes.

==Processing Times==
* [http://www.canadavisa.com/family-class-immigration-processing-times.htm processing times]

==Fees==
There are two types of fees, the Processing Fee and Permanent Residence Fee. Only the Processing Fee needs to be paid immediately, however, both fees may be paid at once.

|-
|

So, for example. a sponsorship of a spouse over 22 years will be $550 for processing and $490 for the PR fees for a total of $1040.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nahuatl (pronounced in two syllables, NA-watl ['na.watɬ]) is a term applied to some members of the Aztecan or Nahuan sub-branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. The languages called &quot;Nahuatl&quot; are all Native American languages indigenous to central Mexico.

[[Image:Codex Borbonicus, p11 trecena13.PNG|right|300px|thumb|A reproduction of the original page 13 of the [[Codex Borbonicus]], showing elements of an almanac associated with the 13th ''[[trecena]]'' of the ''[[tonalpohualli]]'', the [[Aztec]] version of the [[260-day Mesoamerican calendar]]. An example of a largely semasiological text, that holds meaning and can be read, but which does not represent [[phoneme]]s of the actual spoken language.]]

Often the term &quot;Nahuatl&quot; is used specifically with reference to the language called Classical Nahuatl, which was the language of the Aztec Empire and therefore used as a lingua franca in much of Mesoamerica during the 7th century AD through the late 16th century, at which time its prominence and influence was interrupted by the Spanish conquest of the New World. Though it should be pointed out that Nahuatl influence increased slightly for some time before decreasing. The Spaniards used Nahuatl to strengthen their influence over the conquesy territories and to spread Christianity; it was even used in places it had not previously been spoken. This was also done (though maybe not exactly the same way) for the Quechua in South America. It was when the colonies started to gain independence that the Spanish-speaking leaders (mainly &quot;criollos&quot;) made Spanish the predominant language.

The term &quot;Nahuatl&quot; also serves to identify a number of modern Nahuatl dialects (linguistic variants, some of them mutually unintelligible) that are still spoken by at least 1.5 million people in what is now Mexico. All of these dialects show influence from the Spanish language to various degrees, some of them much more than others. No modern dialects are identical with Classical Nahuatl, but those spoken in and around the Valley of Mexico are generally more closely related to Classical Nahuatl than peripheral ones.

Nahuatl is still the most widely spoken group of Native American languages in Mexico

Nahuatl (nāhuatl/nawatlahtolli)

Nahuatl is an Uto-Aztecan language spoken by about 1.5 million people in Mexico. The majority of speakers live in central Mexico, particularly in Puebla, Veracruz, Hildago, San Luis Potosi, Guerrero, Mexico (state), El Distrito Federal, Tlaxcala, Morelos and Oaxaca, and also in El Salvador. There are smaller numbers of Nahuatl speakers throughout the rest of Mexico, and in parts of the USA.

There are numerous dialects of Nahuatl, some of which are mutually unintelligible. Most Nahuatl speakers also speak Spanish, with the exception of some of most elderly.

Classical Nahuatl was the language of the Aztec empire and was used as a lingua franca in much of Mesoamerica from the 7th century AD until the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The modern dialects of Nahuatl spoken in the Valley of Mexico are closest to Classical Nahuatl.

Nahuatl was originally written with a pictographic script which was not a full writing system but instead served as a mnemonic to remind readers of texts they had learnt orally. The script appeared in inscriptions carved in stone and in picture books, many of which the Spanish destroyed.

The Spanish introduced the Latin alphabet to write Nahuatl, and a large amount of prose and poetry was subsequently written. Every since there has been considerable debate about how to spell Nahuatl.

The conjugation of the perfect subjunctive active consists of: the perfect stem + &quot;eri&quot; + the standard active endings (-m, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt). An example conjugation of the first conjugation verb paro, par&amp;#257;re is as follows:&lt;br&gt;

In mathematics, a rational number is a real number that can be written as the ratio of two integers, i.e., it is of the form 
:''a''/''b'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers and ''b'' is not zero. An '''irrational number''' is a number that cannot be written as a ratio of two integers, i.e., it is not of the form 
:''a''/''b'' . 


== History of the theory of irrational numbers ==

The discovery of irrational numbers is usually attributed to Pythagoras, more specifically to the Pythagorean Hippasus of Metapontum, who produced a proof of the irrationality of the &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction (proof below). However, Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but his beliefs would not accept the existence of irrational numbers and so he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning.
As you see, mathematics might be dangerous.

== Irrationality of the square root of 2 ==

In this section we attempt to explain why &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.  Irrational is a fancy word for a number that cannot be written as a fraction where the top and bottom of the fraction are whole numbers.  At one point in time it was once believed that every number could be written as a fraction.  

Before we start the proof we first should recall a few familiar facts.  First, is that when we write fractions we can always ''reduce'' them so they have no common factors.
Just to remind ourselves how this goes, let's think about the fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{15}{21}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since 3 divides into 15 evenly, and 3 divides into 21 evenly, then we can make this fraction have a smaller numerator and denominator.  In this example see this by the following calculation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{15}{21}=\frac{3\cdot 5}{3\cdot 7}=\frac{3}{3}\cdot\frac{5}{7}=1\cdot \frac{5}{7}=\frac{5}{7}&lt;/math&gt;.

The exact same calculation will let us get rid of any number that divides both the numerator and denominator.  Imagine we have a fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt; and there is a number ''r'' so that ''r'' divides evenly into ''p'', and ''r'' divides evenly into ''q''.  We can then write &lt;math&gt;p=r\cdot a&lt;/math&gt; (just like we wrote &lt;math&gt;15=3\cdot 5&lt;/math&gt;).  We can also write &lt;math&gt;q=r\cdot b&lt;/math&gt;. Then the calculation looks like:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}=\frac{r\cdot a}{r\cdot b}=\frac{r}{r}\cdot\frac{a}{b}=1\cdot \frac{a}{b}=\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;.
So whenever we have a fraction where the numerator and denominator are numbers we don't know yet (so we need to use letters like ''p'' and ''q''), we can assume we have already gotten rid of all the numbers that divide both ''p'' and ''q''.

The other thing that we need to remember is our facts about even and odd numbers.  First every even number is really 2 times some smaller number.  This is easy to see if you list out the even numbers:
:{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
 |-
 | even number
 | 2 
 | 4 
 | 6 
 | 8 
 | 10
 | 12
 | 14
 | 16
 | 18
 | 20 
 | …
 |-
 | the same even number &lt;br&gt;as 2&amp;middot;&quot;something&quot;
 | 2&amp;middot;1 
 | 2&amp;middot;2
 | 2&amp;middot;3
 | 2&amp;middot;4
 | 2&amp;middot;5
 | 2&amp;middot;6
 | 2&amp;middot;7 
 | 2&amp;middot;8 
 | 2&amp;middot;9
 | 2&amp;middot;10
 | …
|}

Finally we need to remember that the product of two even numbers is again and even number, and the product of two odd numbers is again an odd number.  In fact this is just the familiar rules:
*&quot;even times even is even&quot;
*&quot;odd times odd is odd&quot;
*&quot;even times odd is even&quot;


Now we can start thinking about the proof. The proof is a &quot;proof by contradiction&quot;.  For us this means we will start by assuming &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a fraction.  We will try to investigate and see what this means for the fraction, being careful that every step follows from the last step by something we know to be true.  At the last step we will contradict ourselves.  This will mean that we had to make a mistake somewhere.  Since we were careful about all of the steps, the only possible place for a mistake will be that we assumed &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a fraction.

# Assume that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a fraction. This means &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;. We will assume that this fraction is reduced, so no number could divide both ''a'' and ''b''.  Specifically 2 cannot divide both ''a'' and ''b''.  
# We now square both sides of your equation, that is we write &lt;math&gt;2=\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;, which is the same as &lt;math&gt;2=\frac{a^2}{b^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
# By multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;a^2=2\cdot b^2 &lt;/math&gt;.
# Therefore &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; is even, because it is equal to &lt;math&gt;2\cdot b^2&lt;/math&gt; which is even.
# If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; were odd, then &lt;math&gt;a^2=a\cdot a&lt;/math&gt; would be odd, because &quot;an odd times an odd is odd&quot;.  So, it follows that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; must be even.
# Because &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is even, and every even number is 2 times something, we can write &lt;math&gt;a = 2\cdot k&lt;/math&gt;, for some whole number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
# If we substitute &lt;math&gt;2\cdot k&lt;/math&gt; in for &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the equation in line 3, we get &lt;math&gt;(2\cdot k)^2 = 2\cdot b^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Now &lt;math&gt;(2\cdot k)^2=(2\cdot k)\cdot(2\cdot k)=4\cdot k^2&lt;/math&gt;.  So, &lt;math&gt;4\cdot k^2=2\cdot b^2&lt;/math&gt;.
# Because &lt;math&gt;2\cdot k^2&lt;/math&gt; is even then &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt; is also even.  Just like we saw with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in line 5, this means that ''b'' is even.
# In line 5 we saw that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; was even and so 2 divides &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  In line 8 we saw that &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; was even, so 2 divides &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  But in line 1 we said that 2 cannot divide both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  This is a contradiction.

Since we have found a contradiction, the assumption in line 1 must be false.  That is, it must be false that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are whole numbers.  So we cannot write &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; has a fraction.  The fancy way of saying this is to say that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) sets out the provisions for access, use, disclosure, interception and privacy protections of electronic communications. The law was enacted in 1986 and covers various forms of wire and electronic communications.  The [[../SCA| Stored Communications Act]] is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and is discussed separately.  

Two federal statutes govern real-time electronic surveillance in federal criminal investigations. The first and most important is the wiretap statute, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2522, first passed as Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (and generally known as &quot;Title III&quot;). The second statute is the Pen Registers and Trap and Trace Devices chapter of Title 18 (&quot;the Pen/Trap statute&quot;), 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3127, which governs pen registers and trap and trace devices.

Title III and the Pen/Trap statute coexist because they regulate access to different types of information. Title III permits the government to obtain the contents of wire and electronic communications in transmission. In contrast, the Pen/Trap statute concerns the real-time collection of addressing and other non-content information relating to those communications. See 18 U.S.C. § 2511(h)(i) (stating that it is not a violation of Title III to use a pen register or trap and trace device); United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC, 227 F.3d 450, 454 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Brown v. Waddell, 50 F.3d 285, 289-94 (4th Cir. 1995) (distinguishing pen registers from Title III intercept devices).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States (title 17, U.S. Code) to the authors of “original works of authorship,” including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, and architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation, although it may protect the way these things are expressed. 

This protection is available to both published and unpublished works. Section 106 of the 1976 Copyright Act generally gives the owner of copyright the exclusive right to do and to authorize others to do the following:

#To reproduce the work in copies or phonorecords;
#To prepare derivative works based upon the work;
#To distribute copies or phonorecords of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;
#To perform the work publicly, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works;
#To display the copyrighted work publicly, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work; and
#In the case of sound recordings, to perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.

In addition, certain authors of works of visual art have the rights of attribution and integrity as described in section 106A of the 1976 Copyright Act.

==WHO CAN CLAIM COPYRIGHT==

Copyright protection subsists from the time the work is created in fixed form. The copyright in the work of authorship immediately becomes the property of the author who created the work. Only the author or those deriving their rights through the author can rightfully claim copyright.

In the case of works made for hire, the employer and not the employee is considered to be the author.

==WHAT WORKS ARE PROTECTED?==

Copyright protects &quot;original works of authorship&quot; that are fixed in a tangible form of expression. The fixation need not be directly perceptible so long as it may be communicated with the aid of a machine or device. Copyrightable works include the following categories:

#literary works;
#musical works, including any accompanying words
#dramatic works, including any accompanying music
#pantomimes and choreographic works
#pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works
#motion pictures and other audiovisual works
#sound recordings
#architectural works

These categories should be viewed broadly. For example, computer programs and most &quot;compilations&quot; may be registered as &quot;literary works&quot;; maps and architectural plans may be registered as &quot;pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.&quot;

==WHAT IS NOT PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT?==

Several categories of material are generally not eligible for federal copyright protection. These include among others:

Works that have not been fixed in a tangible form of expression (for example, choreographic works that have not been notated or recorded, or improvisational speeches or performances that have not been written or recorded)

Titles, names, short phrases, and slogans; familiar symbols or designs; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring; mere listings of ingredients or contents

Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, discoveries, or devices, as distinguished from a description, explanation, or illustration

Works consisting entirely of information that is common property and containing no original authorship (for example: standard calendars, height and weight charts, tape measures and rulers, and lists or tables taken from public documents or other common sources)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)is the most complete attempt so far to bring standardization to the law of computer information transactions.  In July, 1999, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws “NCCUSL”, after 10 years of work, approved the UCITA provisions and recommended that UCITA be enacted in all 50 states.  


In the past, the American Law Institute “ALI” had worked with NCCUSL to study and draft new uniform state laws, however in the case of UCITA, ALI pulled out of the project because of concerns about the proposed act’s scope and its overall coherence and clarity as well as its treatment of customer rights.  In fact ALI members had called for “fundamental revisions” to the proposed Act.


Prior to UCITA, and in states where it or other laws have not been adopted, the Uniform Commercial Code &quot;UCC&quot;, still governs software sales.  The UCC was developed in the 1940s and 1950s to standardize laws for the sale of goods across the U.S.


States must vote whether or not to adopt UCITA without change, with change or not at all.  Two states have adopted UCITA with some modifications; the first was Maryland in 2000 and the second, Virginia in 2001.  In subsequent years, not one other state has adopted UCITA. In fact four states have passed anti-UCITA laws (Iowa, North Carolina, West Virginia and Vermont).  Massachusetts may be the next to pass what has come to be known as “bomb-shelter” legislation, preventing vendors from applying UCITA laws within the state.


UCITA is a proposed uniform law that would create new rules for software licensing, online access and other transactions in computer information. UCITA was originally a joint project of the American Law Institute (ALI) and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Both organizations have withdrawn support.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Luminosity is a measure of energy flux. This is the rate of flow of energy per unit area per unit time from the surface of the body. Luminosity depends both on the temperature of the body and the size of the body. We assume that a body like the Sun emits radiation effectively as a black body. This means it can be modelled using Stefan-Boltzmann's Law.

''L &amp;prop; R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which gives us ''L'' = 4&amp;pi;''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;sigma;T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Where ''T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 5777 K and Stefan-Boltzmann constant: σ = 5.670400 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; W·m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;
What is the Solar luminosity at the surface of the Sun?

Radius of Sun: ''R&lt;sub&gt;sun&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 6.96 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;br&gt;

''L'' = 4 &amp;times; &amp;pi; &amp;times; (6.96 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 5.670400 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; W·m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times; (5777 K)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 3.85 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; W&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Secondary liability can consist of contributory or vicarious liability. 

'''Contributory Infringement'''  - a person with knowledge of the infringing activity induces causes or materially contributes to the conduct of another to infringe.  

'''Vicarious Liability''' - a person or entity has the right and ability to control the activities of the person directly infringing and receives financial benefit from those activities – even if the entity or person is unaware of the activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Operators==
[[w:Programming languages|Programming languages]] have a set of operators that perform arithmetical operations, and others such as Boolean operations on truth values, and string operators manipulating [[w:literal string|strings of text]]. Computers are mathematical devices, but [[w:compiler|compiler]]s and [[w:interpreter|interpreter]]s require a full syntactic theory of all operations in order to parse formulae involving any combinations correctly. In particular they depend on [[w:operator precedence|operator precedence]] rules, on [[w:order of operations|order of operations]], that are tacitly assumed in mathematical writing.

Conventionally, the computing usage of '''''operator''''' also goes beyond the [[w:operator|mathematical usage]] (for functions). In [[w:Visual_basic_.net|Visual Basic.NET]], &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;New&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;AddressOf&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;CType&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt; are operators. You can also define your own uses for operators. When an operator is alphanumeric rather than a punctuation character, it is sometimes called a ''named operator''.

So operators are special symbols that are used to represent for example simple computations like addition and multiplication. Most of the operators in VB.NET do exactly what you would expect them to do, because they are common mathematical symbols. For example, the operator for adding two integers is +.

== Basic Functions ==

Often times, complex signals can be simplified as linear combinations of certain basic functions (a key concept in Fourier analysis).  These basic functions, which are useful to the field of engineering, receive little or no coverage in traditional mathematics classes. These functions will be described here, and studied more in the following chapters.

== Unit Step Function ==

The unit step function and the impulse function are considered to be fundamental functions in engineering, and it is strongly recommended that the reader becomes very familiar with both of these functions.

[[image:Unit Step function u(t) - SST - 08DEC05.png|frame|Unit Step Function]][[Image:Unit_Step_function_u%28t-to%29_-_SST_-_08DEC05.png|frame|Shifted Unit Step function]]
The unit step function, also known as the [[w:Heaviside step function|Heaviside function]], is defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = \left\{ 
               \begin{matrix} 
                 0, &amp; \mbox{if }t &lt; 0 
               \\ 
                 1, &amp; \mbox{if }t &gt; 0
               \\
                 \frac{1}{2}, &amp; \mbox{if }t = 0
               \end{matrix}
             \right.
&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, u(0) is given other values, usually either 0 or 1.  For many applications, it is irrelevant what the value at zero is.
u(0) is generally written as undefined.

=== Derivative ===
The unit step function is level in all places except for a discontinuity at t = 0. For this reason, the derivative of the unit step function is 0 at all points t, except where t = 0. Where t = 0, the derivative of the unit step function is infinite.

The derivative of a unit step function is called an '''impulse function'''. The impulse function will be described in more detail next.

=== Integral ===
The integral of a unit step function is computed as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^t u(s)ds = 

\left\{ 
    \begin{matrix}  0, &amp; \mbox{if }t &lt; 0   \\ 
                   \int_0^t ds = t, &amp; \mbox{if }t \ge 0 
    \end{matrix}
\right\} = tu(t)&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the integral of a unit step is a &quot;ramp&quot; function. This function is 0 for all values that are less than zero, and becomes a straight line at zero with a slope of +1.

=== Time Inversion ===

if we want to reverse the unit step function, we can flip it around the y axis as such: u(-t). With a little bit of manipulation, we can come to an important result:

:&lt;math&gt;u(-t) = 1 - u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Other Properties ===

Here we will list some other properties of the unit step function: 

*&lt;math&gt;u(\infty) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;u(-\infty) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;u(t) + u(-t) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

These are all important results, and the reader should be familiar with them.

== Impulse Function ==


An impulse function is a special function that is often used by engineers to model certain events. An impulse function is not realizable, in that by definition the output of an impulse function is infinity at certain values. An impulse function is also known as a &quot;delta function&quot;, although there are different types of delta functions that each have slightly different properties.  Specifically, this ''unit-impulse function'' is known as the Dirac delta function.  The term &quot;Impulse Function&quot; is unambiguous, because there is only one definition of the term &quot;Impulse&quot;.

Let's start by drawing out a rectangle function, D(t), as such:
[[Image:Dirac Delta.svg|right|300px]]
We can define this rectangle in terms of the unit step function:

:&lt;math&gt;D(t) = \frac{1}{A}[u(t + A/2) - u(t - A/2)]&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we want to analyze this rectangle, as A becomes infinitesimally small. We can define this new function, the '''delta function''', in terms of this rectangle:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(t) = \lim_{A \to 0}\frac{1}{A}[u(t + A/2) - u(t - A/2)]&lt;/math&gt;

We can similarly define the delta function piecewise, as such:

#&lt;math&gt;\delta(t) = 0\mbox{ for } t \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\delta(t) &gt; 0\mbox{ for } t = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(t) dt = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Although, this definition is less rigorous than the previous definition.

=== Integration ===

From its definition it follows that the integral of the impulse function is just the step function:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \delta(t)dt = u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, defining the derivative of the unit step function as the impulse function is justified.

=== Shifting Property ===

Furthermore, for an integrable function ''f'':

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(t - A) f(t)dt = f(A)&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the '''shifting property''' (also known as the '''sifting property''' or the '''sampling property''') of the delta function; it effectively samples the value of the function ''f'', at location ''A''.  

The delta function has many uses in engineering, and one of the most important uses is to sample a continuous function into discrete values.

Using this property, we can extract a single value from a continuous function by multiplying with an impulse, and then integrating.

=== Types of Delta ===

There are a number of different functions that are all called &quot;delta functions&quot;. These functions generally all look like an impulse, but there are some differences. Generally, this book uses the term &quot;delta function&quot; to refer to the '''Dirac Delta Function'''.

*[[w:Dirac delta function]] 
*[[w:Kronecker delta]]

== Sinc Function ==

There is a particular form that appears so frequently in communications engineering, that we give it its own name. This function is called the &quot;Sinc function&quot; and is discussed below:

The Sinc function is defined in the following manner:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \mbox{ if } x \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
and 

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sinc}(0) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The value of sinc(x) is defined as 1 at x = 0, since  

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow 0}\operatorname{sinc}(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

This fact can be proven by noting that for x near 0,

:&lt;math&gt;1 &gt; \frac{\sin{(x)}}{x} &gt; \cos{(x)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, since cos(0) = 1, we can apply the [[Calculus/Limits/An_Introduction_to_Limits#The_Squeeze_Theorem|''Squeeze Theorem'']] to show that the sinc function approaches one as x goes to zero. Thus, defining sinc(0) to be 1 makes the sinc function continuous.

Also, the Sinc function approaches zero as x goes towards infinity, with the envelope of sinc(x) tapering off as 1/x.

== '''Rect Function''' ==

The Rect Function is a function which produces a rectangular-shaped pulse with a width of 1 centered at t = 0. The Rect function pulse also has a height of 1.
The Sinc function and the rectangular function form a Fourier transform pair.

A Rect function can be written in the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rect}\left(\frac{t-X}{Y} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the pulse is centered at X and has width Y. We can define the impulse function above in terms of the rectangle function by centering the pulse at zero (X = 0), setting it's height to 1/A and setting the pulse width to A, which approaches zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(t) = \lim_{A \to 0} \frac{1}{A}\operatorname{rect}\left(\frac{t-0}{A}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

We can also construct a Rect function out of a pair of unit step functions:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rect}\left(\frac{t-X}{Y} \right) = u(t - X + Y/2) - u(t - X - Y/2)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, both unit step functions are set a distance of Y/2 away from the center point of (t - X).

== Square Wave ==

A square wave is a series of rectangular pulses. Here are some examples of square waves:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
|[[Image:Square Wave T.svg|center|300px]]
|[[Image:Square Wave 2T.svg|center|300px]]
|-
|colspan=2|These two square waves have the same amplitude, but the second has a lower frequency. We can see that the period of the second is approximately twice as large as the first, and therefore that the frequency of the second is about half the frequency of the first.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|[[Image:Square Wave T.svg|center|300px]]
|[[Image:Square Wave Offset.svg|center|300px]]
|-
|colspan=2|These two square waves have the same frequency and the same peak-to-peak amplitude, but the second wave has no DC offset. Notice how the second wave is centered on the ''x'' axis, while the first wave is completely above the ''x'' axis.
|}

==Video Tutorial==
A video tutorial has been created for this chapter in Blender 2.48a.

It is compressed and packaged in the Theora (.ogg) video format and requires a player that is able to decode this codec in order to play it, such as the [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ VLC] player which is available as a free download for Windows, Mac, and most Linux distributions. Firefox 3.5 is also able to stream Theora video.

For best results, it is recommended that you save this file to your computer for viewing, rather than streaming it inside a web browser, since it is 1020 x 746 pixels.

[[File:Blender3D Die Another Way.ogv|765px]]

==Introduction==
In the following tutorial you will be creating a die. You will use:
*polygon mesh
*face loop cutting
*subdivision surfaces
*subdivision creases
*bevel
*set smooth
*multiple materials
*extrusion
*merge vertices
*remove doubles
*constraints

There are two methods to create the circles for the die: subdivide first, or manual sizing. In either case, start with the default Cube.

==Subdivide First==
The die needs to have a 3x3 matrix for the coloured dots (pips).  A quick way to do this is to simply ''Subdivide'' the cube twice before doing anything else.  The disadvantage may be that the spaces for the pips may not be exactly the size that you want.  If not, see the next section: Manual Sizing of Pips.

== Manual Sizing of Pips ==
=== Step 1 ===
Hit tab to go into edit-mode and select all faces to prevent bevel
messing up normals. Hit '''WKEY''' ''&amp;rarr; Bevel'', ''Recursion &amp;rarr; 1'' (you'll see why
later) then choose bevel size (hit spacebar for manual input). Bevel of 0.150 is ok. &lt;br&gt;
Note: If you have chosen to subdivide the die twice, jump to Section &quot;Creating Pips&quot; and put bevel of 0.17 in order to have pip's edges length 0.34

[[Image:DieAnotherWay2.png]]

=== Step 2 ===
In editmode, go to the Editing tab ('''F9''') and look at the '''&lt;u&gt;Mesh Tools 1&lt;/u&gt;''' panel (''Mesh Tools More'' in some versions). Turn on Edge Length and note the length of one of the sides of the
square faces. This should be 1.7 if the
above settings were used.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;
Button &quot;Edge Length&quot; may be outside the screen so you may need to close another set of buttons before you can get to it.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Or, you can use MMB to scroll over to see the Mesh Tools 1 panel (in later versions: Mesh Tools More) with &quot;Edge Length&quot; button on it.&lt;br&gt;
Or, you can zoom in and out in the menu window with CTRL and NUM+ or NUM-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Or, you can press HOME when button window is focused to see all buttons.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay3b.png]]

=== Step 3 ===
A typical die has a grid of 9 possible positions for the pips and
the gap between the pips is the pip radius (or half the diameter). So, there are
conveniently 10 units on each edge of the square faces, where the gaps
use 4 of the units and the 3 pips use two each. This means the gaps are of
size 1.7/10 = 0.17 and the pips (1.7x2)/10 = 0.34.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:9 posiciones.jpg|341px]]&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:muescas y espacios.jpg|341px]]

=== Step 4 ===
[[Image:BlenderDieanotherway3-00.png|right|190px]]

Now it's time to subdivide the surfaces of the die according to the mathematics above. We'll do that using &quot;edge loops&quot; - additional edges you can add to existing objects.

*Select axis aligned view: '''NUM1'''
*Enter loop cut mode: '''CTRL+RKEY''' (OR '''KKEY→1KEY''' OR '''KKEY'''→''Loop Cut'' OR '''CTRL+EKEY'''→''Loopcut'' OR '''CTRL+EKEY'''→'''NUM5''')
*Select loops' placement: move the mouse around until you see a purple line going the right direction.
&lt;!--*Assure: axis aligned view '''NUM1''' AND orthographic view '''NUM5''' AND selection not limited to visible (can't find hotkey for this)--&gt;
*Enter the number of loops: '''9KEY''' (OR '''NUM9''' OR '''SCROLL''' up 9 times OR '''NUM+''' 8 times)
*Add the loop: '''LMB''' (OR '''ENTER''' etc.) on one of the big faces
&lt;small&gt;''Noob: What's &quot;the right direction?&quot; What should this thing look like after applying the loop/cut?  HELP!''&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;''Another Noob: It sounds like you have version 2.44 or later. You should do the tuturial &quot;Die Easy&quot;(seriously, it is).''&lt;/small&gt;

Now we just have to get rid of the 2nd, 5th and 8th loops to make the undivided spaces for the marks.

*Select edge select or vertex select: '''CTRL+TAB→NUM2''' (OR '''CTRL+TAB'''→''Edges'' OR '''CTRL+TAB→NUM1''' etc.)
&lt;!--*Select edge on a loop to remove: '''RMB''' --&gt;
*Deselect all edges with AKEY
*Choose a loop to remove (using the BKEY to enter box selection mode and drawing a box around the one you want; this will get the whole loop, all the way around the cube).&lt;small&gt;Spoiler: you can also use Alt-RMB on an edge to select a loop (or select the edge and click ''Select --&gt; Edge loop'').&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;small&gt;''Noob: It seems that I could not remove multi loops at the same time, since the error message kept bumping out.''
Another Noob: That happened to me when I tried to remove them all at once, but it worked fine when I removed one at a time.&lt;/small&gt;
*Remove loop: '''XKEY→7''' (OR '''XKEY'''→''Edge Loop'')
Change views with NUM3 and NUM7 and repeat steps as necessary. When you're done, your die should look like the one pictured to the right.

== Creating Pips ==
The die needs the pips added.  Everyone knows how the pips on a die look, right?
=== Extrude and Merge ===
(Note: This is Step 10)  
Select one of the faces where a pip would go and extrude the face by hitting '''EKEY''' and then '''ESC'''. Do not click after hitting '''EKEY'''.  This actually replaces the first face with another one even though it looks like nothing has happened.  Merge the second face by using '''ALT + MKEY''' to merge the 4 corners into the centre.  It will tell you ''Removed 3 vertices''.  &lt;font style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;[User Note: To clarify, pressing ESC when extruding does in fact extrude the face as per usual, but by a distance of zero.  This creates four new, infinitely narrow faces around the original square face. These four faces then get 'dragged' into the middle when the four vertices of the original square are merged into one.  Test this by extruding by say, 0.01 (instead of pressing ESC), and you'll see the result is almost the same.][User Note: on my computer hitting ESC after the EKEY seemed to cancel the extrude and to get the correct result I had to hit the &quot;ENTER&quot; key after the EKEY]&lt;/font&gt;  You should get the following:

[[Image:DieAnotherWay10a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;Do this for the configuration of the dots on that side. So for
example, 5 would look like this:

[[Image:DieAnotherWay10b.png|200px]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;
Notes : &lt;br&gt;
* You could create this pip spot on all 9 spots and copy this side of the die to the other six.  The amount of time spent doing all of that may be just as long as doing each side individually. You would need to delete the other 5 faces, copy the dented face 5 times, place each face precisely by rotating and moving, and remove doubles.
* (User comment) I accidentally selected some pip faces from the opposite side of the die (the side behind the side I was looking at).  To prevent this, I selected ''Limit selection to visible'' (''Occlude background geometry'' in 2.47) [[Image:BlenderCommonLSTV-on.png]]: which should be the second button from the right in the header of the  ''3D View''.
* '''Noob, 19th Oct 2008:''' You can save time by selecting all the 'pip faces' and extruding them simultaneously, '''ESC'''-ing immediately after you do so, like above. You'll still need to merge the four corners of each extrusion one-by-one, though, or you'll get some odd results.
* '''Noob, 28th Dec 2008:''' You can save more time be extruding all faces simultaneously, as above, and then selecting &quot;Collapse&quot; rather than &quot;At Center&quot; while merging.
* '''Noob, 02/02/09:''' I tried with the &quot;Collapse&quot; trick as well but all I got were just black squares.
* '''Noob, 19/02/09:''' I got the black squares as well, but it is just a display problem. Press ''Tab'' twice (going to ''Object mode'' and back to ''Edit mode'') and they are gone.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Create Pips ===
(Note: This is Step 11)  Select one of the edges of the pips to check the size is 0.34.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Remember the pip radius was 0.17. We need to use this value to lower
the centre point of the pips. Select all the 5 centre points at
once to save time and move them inwards by 0.17. The side I put the 5
pips on here was the top so I move the vertices inwards by pressing '''GKEY''', '''ZKEY''', -0.17 and hitting '''ENTER'''. I then get this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay11b.png]]

(user comment) According to step 4 we are still in front-view ('''NUM1'''), but then the '''ZKEY''' modification gives undesirable result, changing view to top ('''NUM7''') does the trick! This applies to blender version 2.44.
* (response) Actually, at the end of step 4 it states to change to side and top view ('''NUM3''' and '''NUM7''') as necessary, so really there is no official view the tutorial left the user in.  Also, in this step, the writer mentions they put 5 pips on the top.
* (user comment) using '''YKEY''' instead of '''ZKEY''' is also fine.
* (user comment) Depending on which axis it's supposed to be moved, use the '''ZKEY''','''XKEY''' and '''YKEY''' after the '''GKEY''' accordingly.
* (user comment) Pressing '''ZKEY''' twice should move them along the normal, which should work no matter which faces are selected.
* (user comment) I noticed a shortcut: When you extrude, extrude by -0.17 and then do the Merge -&gt; Collapse. Then the point is already inside.
* (user comment) I just noticed something different. If you extrude and collapse, after applying the subsurf, you got sharp edges of the pips than the pips I got in this tutorial way.
* (user comment) In blender 2.49a there is an issue where when &quot;Occlude background geometry&quot; is on, sometimes you'll click a vertex and have a far away vertex clicked instead. Rotating the camera usually helps, and if you find your vertex isn't selected, but you know you clicked, clicking again will deselect whatever vertex you selected. Also a big issue with the extrusion - as with escape, right clicking to exit extrusion also creates an &quot;unseen extrusion&quot; .  The &quot;unseen extrusion&quot; can be noticed - there's black dots in the middle of your square edges. This is caused by the 0-width faces being selectable (and therefore having a dot in the middle). I had to completely do-over my model because Remove Doubles _did not_ remove the extra vertices. This became noticeable when I would extrude and it would only extrude vertices.
* (user comment): Don't collapse the vertices! In that case, the pits will be rendered badly. Collapsing removes four vertices, merging at the center removes three vertices --&gt; so there is a difference!
* (user comment): You can just have the pivot be Individual Centers and scale to zero, then you can remove doubles and it works out fine. That's the fastest way I can think of doing this.

=== Smooth Out ===
'''TAB''' out of Edit Mode. If you haven't done this already, hit Set Smooth in the Editing panel and turn on subdivision surfaces&lt;br&gt;
It should look something like this:


In present versions, you just need to use &quot;Add Modifier&quot; on the Modifiers tab (in Edit-mode), to add a SubSurf modifier. (Or press '''SHIFT+OKEY''')&lt;br&gt;
In the image below Levels is set to 3.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay12c.png]]

=== Make Sharp Edges ===
On a die, the edges of the pips are usually sharp so we'll use
subsurface creasing to do that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go back into editmode and with the edge select mode on, select all the
perimeters of the pips like so (it may help to turn off subsurf for
the moment):&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay13.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
Press '''SHIFT+EKEY''' to enable creasing and move the mouse until the display
says crease is at 1. (to see the effect, you must have the subsurf modifier
turned ON).&amp;nbsp; After pressing '''SHIFT+EKEY''', you can then set
crease values in the information box that you get by pressing '''NKEY''' when
objects are selected. This can be useful to check if all the edges have
the right crease because it gives you the average crease value and if
it is less than 1, there is an edge wrong.&lt;br&gt;
'''Newbie Note:''' Trying to crease all 6 sides of the die at once using 
'''SHIFT+EKEY''' and moving the mouse doesn't crease all sides of the die. 
Better to use '''NKEY''', or do one side at a time.

=== Repeat ===
Repeat steps 10, 11 and 13 (that is [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Die_Another_Way#Extrude_and_Merge|Extrude and Merge]], [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Die_Another_Way#Create_Pips|Create Pips]] and [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Die_Another_Way#Make_Sharp_Edges|Make Sharp Edges]]) for all the sides of the die. REMEMBER, a die is
numbered so that opposite sides add up to 7. In my example, that means
I put 2 on the bottom etc. Once you finish, if you turn on subdiv level 2,
you will get something like this:&lt;br&gt; &lt;font style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;[User Note: Do you mean subsurf instead of subdiv?]&lt;/font&gt; 
* Noob note: On the side with 6 pips, I had a hard time getting the creases to work.  It turned out to be because I selected in vertex mode when I selected the edges for creasing, and I tried to crease all 6 pips at once.  This put crease values on the short vertical edges between the pips, which messed things up.
[[Image:DieAnotherWay14.png|200px]]

* User Shortcut: To do them all at once with no repeating. However, order of operation has to change to make it work:
** In Face Select mode, select all pip faces on all sides.
** '''SHIFT+EKEY''' to crease the edges. (needs to be done before extruding, since extruding changed the selection)
** '''EKEY -&gt; Individual Faces''' then type -0.17 to extrude all faces inward.
** '''ALT+MKEY -&gt; Collapse''' will merge all the extrusions to their respective centers.
(noobie) Some of my pips are square and I tried everything. What should I do?
(noob reply) Maybe you had the vertex at the center of pips selected while creasing.

=== Camera Setup ===
You can make a test render now to see that the pips are the right
size and that the bevel is right. So, turn the subsurf level for the
rendering up to 3. To help position the camera so that you centre the
die, you can make the camera look at the die by adding a track-to
constraint to it. I prefer to track an empty though, because it is more
flexible.

&lt;br&gt;
Make an empty by going into top down view ('''NUM7''') and hitting
'''SPACE''' ''&amp;rarr; Add &amp;rarr; Empty''.
('''Noob note:''' If you can't find &quot;empty&quot; in the list, make sure you are in Object mode.) It's always best to go into one of the set
orthographic views so as to align new objects to the axes. If you add
something misaligned, just go to the object menu then clear/apply &amp;gt; clear
rotation (or '''ALT+RKEY'''). Because the empty was created at the origin, you
might not be able to see it as it is inside the die. Hit '''ZKEY''' to enable
wireframe mode and select the empty. Just move it outside the cube
until we get the constraint set up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To add a track-to constraint, select the camera first then '''SHIFT+RMB'''
the empty and press '''CTRL+TKEY''' and choose &quot;TrackTo Constraint&quot; from the list. Move the
empty back inside the die. You can edit constraints in the object tab ('''F7''').
Add a couple of lamps (both intensity 1) to get the scene like this or feel free to experiment with a more advanced lighting setup:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Another way to position the camera is by selecting it and then looking
through it as you move it. Look through the camera by pressing
'''NUM0'''. Use the '''GKEY''' to pan across and rotate around the local axes
of the camera by pressing say '''RKEY''','''XKEY''','''XKEY''' to rotate in X-axis. To zoom in and out
press '''GKEY''', '''ZKEY''', '''ZKEY''' and then move your mouse forwards or backwards. Another useful keystroke (for pre-2.43 especially) to know is that when you are in camera view, pressing '''Gkey''' and then '''MMB''', movement will be constrained to the way you are facing. The '''mouse wheel''' zoom moves your view towards and away from the camera, without actually moving the position of the camera.&lt;br&gt;

You can also move the Camera in free &quot;Fly&quot; mode by going into the Camera view (press NUM0) and then Shift+F. Now you can &quot;Fly&quot; through the scene and use this setup the camera angle. Make sure that you keey the flying velocity very low by using the scroll wheels or -/+ buttons or the camera will be simply out of control.

=== Render ===
To render, set the size of the image you want. 800x600 is a decent
size so put these settings in the format panel in the Scene tab ('''F10''').
In the render panel, make sure 100% is selected. If it's 50%,
the render will come out as 400x300. For preview renders, don't turn on
OSA, which is anti-aliasing because it slows your renders down
significantly. Try to only use it for a final render.&lt;br&gt;

Another important point is to set the image format. This is done in the
format panel. The listbox has a number of image types. I find
that png is generally the best because it is lossless and offers the
highest compression among the lossless formats. It also supports an
alpha channel for transparency. When rendering an animation, it is
better to render as an image sequence than as a movie because it is
easier to edit these and repair broken frames. Quicktime supports
loading of image sequences and you can save as a movie using
a wide range of compression formats.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To save the render, go to the '''file menu → save image''' (Or press '''F3''') and type in the
full name of the image including the extension e.g. die.png.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The output should now be looking something like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay15.png]]&lt;br&gt;
[user note] To get such a nice render I had to bump the render level of subsurf up to 5, otherwise I get artifacts around the pips
&lt;br&gt;
[user reply] If OSA is on for the final render, you'll get a nice render result as shown by the above figure with subsurf level 3.
&lt;br&gt;
[user note] If you set smooth on the whole shape, you'll get artifacts around the circles.
&lt;br&gt;
[user reply] To avoid artifacts around the circles, you'll have to turn on '''Auto Smooth'''

== Color ==
=== Multiple Materials ===
[[Image:BlenderDieanotherway5-01.png|right]]

.
.
&lt;br&gt;
To give it some colour, we will need to use multiple materials
because a typical die has pips that are a different colour from the
die itself.&lt;br&gt;
In the ''Buttons Window''  [[Image:BlenderCommonButtonswindow.png]] go to the ''Editing'' panel [[Image:BlenderCommonEditing-on.png]] ('''F9''') again and make sure the die is selected. In the ''Links and Materials'' subpanel there is a section for materials (the right; the left one is for vertex groups) and the box left of the question mark should read &quot;''0 Mat 0''&quot; (the first number is the number of material links for this object; the second number is the number of the currently selected material link).[[Image:DieAnotherWay17.png|left|132px]]
The die may have more than zero materials if you had assigned materials to the object already. By pressing the ''New'' button add enough materials to make 2 in total.

[[Image:DieAnotherWay17b.png|left]]
Go back to the ''Shading'' panel [[Image:BlenderCommonShading-on.png]] ('''F5''') and there is a box at the very top of the ''Links and Pipelines'' subpanel with the number 2 beside it. If there is no such subpanel select ''Material buttons'' [[Image:BlenderCommonMaterialbuttons-on.png]] (cycle shading buttons using '''F5''' too). Click this number and select ''Single user'' in the dialog to make the two materials you've just created independent. Use the arrows on the left side of the box to switch materials.
[[Image:BlenderDieanotherway5-04.png|right]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;
Note: If you do not see a ''2'' to the right of the material name, that means the material is already a single user material. To change it back you can click the button labelled ''F'', but for this example, you do not want to do that.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;
Note: There should be at least two materials now. One has the materials initial name the other has a number appended to its name (e.g. ''Material'' and ''Material.001'').
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Use the ''Material'' subpanel to make material 1 bright red by just picking red in the colour picker (the rectangle to the left of the ''Col'' button) or by setting the RGB sliders (right of the ''Col'' button). Make material 2 white by doing the same. Or pick whatever colour you prefer and material settings.
[[Image:BlenderDieanotherway5-04a.png|left]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;
'''--[[User:MSK61|MSK61]] ([[User talk:MSK61|talk]]) 11:27, 17 March 2008 (UTC)''': The colour picker is to the left(not right) of the ''Col'' button, while the the RGB sliders are to the right(not left) of the ''Col'' button.

Note: It is possible that the two materials were not automatically linked to the material links of your die. If so use the ''Links and Pipeline'' subpanel to link the &lt;font style=&quot;color:#0000FF&quot;&gt;materials&lt;/font&gt; to the respective &lt;font style=&quot;color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;material links&lt;/font&gt;. First select the link then the material.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'' Note from noob: Using white as a colour will not let you spot a change in colour, since the default colour '''is''' white. For test purposes I recommend you choose another colour (e.g. blue), so you can avoid getting confused.''

'' Note from another noob: Actually (at least in blender 2.49), the default color is grey. To choose a white color, set all colors (R,G,B) up to 1.000.''

=== Assign Materials ===
These colours need to be assigned to the right parts of the die.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:BlenderDieanotherway5-05.png|right|190px]]
[[Image:DieAnotherWay18b.png|right|190px]]
Go into ''Edit Mode'' and turn off subsurf to make selecting easier. Do this in the ''Editing'' panels ('''F9''') ''Modifiers'' subpanel. Right after the subsurf modifiers name there are three buttons (darkgrey). Press the rightmost to deactivate the modifier in the edit mode.

==== To make the die red ====

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Select the entire die (AKEY).
*Click the Editing button (F9).
*In the Link and Materials panel, on the right-hand side you will see &quot;2 Mat X&quot; where X is either 1 or 2. Click the left/right arrows until you see the adjoining square to the left turn red. As you click on the arrows, notice that the label above &quot;2 Mat X&quot; changes from &quot;Material&quot; to &quot;Material.001&quot;. These are the names of the materials that you created in the Shading (F5)-&gt;Links and Pipeline panel.
*Click the Assign button (in the Material column, not the Vertex Groups column). The Assign button associates the selected faces with the selected material.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The entire die should now be red.

==== To make the pips white ====

Use the same method as above, but with only the inner faces of the pips selected and with the colour white.

There are a variety of ways to select the inner faces of the pips:

==== Pip Selection Method 1 ====
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Note: Here you may find ''Lasso Select'' useful.
*Make sure you are in ''Edit Mode'' [[Image:BlenderCommonEditmode.png]] ('''TAB''')
*Select ''Face select'' [[Image:BlenderCommonFaceselect-on.png]]: '''CTRL+TAB&amp;rarr;3KEY'''
*Select ''Limit selection to visible'' [[Image:BlenderCommonLSTV-on.png]]: should be the second button from the right in the header of the  ''3D View''
*Go through the axis align views and select the faces:
**Align view: '''NUM1''' ('''CTRL+NUM1''', '''NUM3''', '''CTRL+NUM3''', '''NUM7''', '''CTRL+NUM7''')
**For each view, lasso select the pips' faces: hold '''CTRL''' and drag '''LMB''' around the pips' middle vertex (no need to press '''SHIFT''', ''Lasso Select'' automatically adds the new faces to the previous selection).
*If all went well you should be able to read ''Fa:84-449'' in the ''User Preferences'' right after the Blender version number. (84 = 4*(1+2+3+4+5+6))
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Pip Selection Method 2 ====
Press '''CTRL'''+'''ALT'''+'''SHIFT'''+'''3KEY''' and every triangular face will be selected.(Every pip + The 8 corners of the dice. Just deselect the 8 corners and you're good to go!) ;-)
Similarly, you can select quad faces using the '''4KEY'''. 

==== Pip Selection Method 3 ====
You can also use circle select to easily select the desired faces. Enter circle select mode by hitting '''BKEY''' twice. The circle can be made bigger or smaller by using the '''scroll wheel'''. Drop out of the mode ('''RMB''') to rotate the cube and drop back in as above. Selected vertices are added to those already selected like with lasso mode but without the need to keep holding the control key or draw an accurate lasso)

[[Image:DieAnotherWay18.png|left|200px]]

&lt;br&gt;
Turn subsurf back on (''Modifiers panel''→subsurf modifier→enable in edit mode) and render '''F12''' with OSA (only put it up as high as you need for the resolution of the image you are rendering).

''(Note: in Blender 2.44 you should use the ''Assign button'' in the editing panel (''Link and Materials''))''

''(another noob says: don't be fooled (as I was!) by the fact that there are TWO Assign buttons in this tab, you want the big one on the right under materials, not the small one on the left under Vertex groups!!)''

{{subject|}}

==== Pip Selection Method 4 ====

That's the easiest way:
1- select one of the triangles (the face)
2- '''Shift+Gkey''', then choose perimeter or press '''4NUM'''.

=== Extra ===
The reason I modelled the die this way is because it is also very easy
to change the sizes of the components e.g. the bevel and the pip size.
You do this by selecting the vertical or horizontal segments and just
scaling them in one axis. Here we will reduce the pip size and the
bevel by half.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go into front view ('''NUM1'''), turn off clipping (i.e., allow selection of invisible vertices) and select a line containing pips (i.e., Select vertices mode ('''CTRL+TAB+NUM1'''), and box select a thin vertical line of vertices to the left of a row of pips, then box select another thin vertical line of vertices to the right of that row of pips, making a total of 64 vertices).  Then just scale in one axis e.g. '''SKEY''', '''XKEY''', 0.5. Remember to
have your pivot point set to median:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- don;t exist any longer [[Image:DieAnotherWayE1.png|200px|]]&lt;br&gt; --&gt;
Do this horizontally and vertically around the die. You should need to
scale 9 times for the pips and 6 times for the bevel:

''(Noob note: I find this confusing.  what is a line containing pips?  does this mean a loop line?  Using alt-RMB no longer works to select a loop, but selects a single edge.)''

''(Noob response: he meant a pair of loops of vertices adjacent to a row containing pips.  alt-RMB no longer seems to select complete loops - it works until it hits a pip and then it stops - but the box selection can be used.)''

''(Another Response: Any time you change the geometry of a shape you effect how the automated tools will work.  Many dont work at all once you get to complex organic shapes, so its best to not rely on them too heavily.)''

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- don;t exist any longer[[Image:DieAnotherWayE2.png|200px|]]&lt;br&gt; --&gt;
You may need to add extra geometry once you are satisfied with the
sizes of the dots and the bevel so that the edges of the die don't look
warped due to the subdivision. You can use face loop cut again for that
and add extra lines in the middle of the gap segments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- don;t exist any longer [[Image:DieAnotherWayE3.png|200px|]]&lt;br&gt; --&gt;

== Circuits ==

'''Circuits''' (also known as &quot;networks&quot;) are collections of circuit elements and wires. Wires are designated on a schematic as being straight lines. Nodes are locations on a schematic where 2 or more wires connect, and are usually marked with a dark black dot. Circuit Elements are &quot;everything else&quot; in a sense. Most basic circuit elements have their own symbols so as to be easily recognizable, although some will be drawn as a simple box image, with the specifications of the box written somewhere that is easy to find. We will discuss several types of basic circuit components in this book.

== Ideal Wires ==

For the purposes of this book, we will assume that an ideal wire has zero total resistance, no capacitance, and no inductance. A consequence of these assumptions is that these ideal wires have infinite bandwidth, are immune to interference, and are — in essence — completely uncomplicated. This is not the case in real wires, because all wires have at least some amount of associated resistance. Also, placing multiple real wires together, or bending real wires in certain patterns will produce small amounts of capacitance and inductance, which can play a role in circuit design and analysis. This book will assume that all wires are ideal.

== Ideal Junctions or Nodes ==

[[File:Node-pressure.jpg|thumb|right|Nodes are areas where the Electromotive Force is the same.]]

Nodes are also called &quot;junctions&quot; in this book in order to make a distinction between Node analysis, Kirchhoff's current law and discussions about a physical node itself. Here a physical node is discussed. 

A junction is a group of wires that share the same [[:wikipedia:Electromotive_force|electromotive force]] (not voltage). Wires ideally have no resistance, thus all wires that touch wire to wire somewhere are part of the same node. The diagram on the right shows three big blue nodes, two smaller green nodes and two trivial (one wire touching another) nodes. 

Sometimes a node is described as where two or more wires touch and students circle where wires intersect and call this a node. This only works on simple circuits.

One node has to be labeled ground in any circuit drawn before voltage can be computed or the circuit simulated. Typically this is the node having the most components connected to it. Logically it is normally placed at the bottom of the circuit logic diagram.

Ground is not always needed physically. Some circuits are [[:w:Floating_ground|floated]] on purpose. 

[[/NodeQuiz/|Node Quiz]]

== Measuring instruments ==
'''Voltmeters and Ammeters''' are devices that are used to measure the voltage across an element, and the current flowing through a wire, respectively. 

=== Ideal Voltmeters ===
An ideal voltmeter has an infinite resistance (in reality, several megaohms), and acts like an open circuit. A [[:wikiversity:Tutorial_on_preparing_the_multimeter_for_start_measuring_the_voltage|voltmeter]] is placed across the terminals of a circuit element, to determine the voltage across that element. In practice the voltmeter siphons a enough energy to move a needle, cause thin strips of metal to separate or turn on a transistor so a number is displayed.

=== Ideal Ammeters ===

An ideal ammeter has zero resistance and acts like a short circuit. Ammeters require cutting a wire and plugging the two ends into the Ammeter. In practice an ammeter places a tiny resistor in a wire and measures the tiny voltage across it or the ammeter measures the [[:w:Clamp_meter|magnetic field strength]] generated by current flowing through a wire. Ammeters are not used that much because of the wire cutting, or wire disconnecting they require.

== Active Passive &amp; ReActive ==

The elements which are capable of delivering energy or which are capable to amplify the signal are called &quot;Active elements&quot;. All power supplies fit into this category.

The elements which will receive the energy and dissipate it are called &quot;Passive elements&quot;. Resistors model these devices. 

Reactive elements store and release energy into a circuit. Ideally they don't either consume or generate energy. Capacitors, and inductors fall into this category.

== Open and Short Circuits ==

===Open===
No current flows through an open. Normally an '''open''' is created by a bad connector. Dust, bad solder joints, bad crimping, cracks in circuit board traces, create an '''open'''. Capacitors respond to DC by turning into '''opens''' after charging up. Uncharged inductors appear as '''opens''' immediately after powering up a circuit. The word '''open''' can refer to a problem description. The word '''open''' can also help develop an intuition about circuits. 

Typically the circuit stops working with opens because 99% of all circuits are driven by voltage power sources. Voltage sources respond to an open with no current. Opens are the equivalent of clogs in plumbing .. which stop water from flowing.

On one side of the open, EMF will build up, just like water pressure will build up on one side of a clogged pipe. Typically a voltage will appear across the open.

===Short===
A voltage source responds to a '''short''' by delivering as much current as possible. An extreme example of this can be seen in this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g60okBMeTKo ball bearing motor video]. The motor appears as a short to the battery. Notice he only completes the short for a short time because he is worried about the car battery exploding. 

Maximum current flows through a '''short'''. Normally a '''short''' is created by a wire, a nail, or some loose screw touching parts of the circuit unintentionally. Most component failures start with heat build up. The heat destroys varnish, paint, or thin insulation creating a '''short'''. The '''short''' causes more current to flow which causes more heat. This cycle repeats faster and faster until there is a puff of smoke and everything breaks creating an '''open'''. Most component failures start with a '''short''' and end in an '''open''' as they burn up. Feel the air temperature above each circuit component after power on. Build a memory of what normal operating temperatures are. Cold can indicate a short that has already turned into an open. 

An uncharged capacitor initially appears as a '''short''' immediately after powering on a circuit. An inductor appears as a '''short''' to DC after charging up. The '''short''' concept also helps build our intuition, provides an opportunity to talk about electrical safety and helps describe component failure modes. 

A '''closed''' switch can be thought of as short. [[:wikipedia:Switch|Switches]] are surprisingly complicated. It is in a study of switches that the term '''closed''' begins to dominate that of '''short'''.</text>

There are many tools available to analyze a system in the time domain, although many of these tools are very complicated and involved. Nonetheless, these tools are invaluable for use in the study of linear signals and systems, so they will be covered here.

{{RenderPNG}}

== Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems ==

This page will contain the definition of a LTI system and this will be used to motivate the definition of convolution as the output of a LTI system in the next section. To begin with a system has to be defined and the LTI properties have to be listed. Then, for a given input it can be shown (in this section or the following) that the output of a LTI system is a convolution of the input and the system's impulse response, thus motivating the definition of convolution.

Consider a system for which an input of ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'' results in an output of ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'' respectively for ''i = 1, 2''.

=== Linearity ===

There are 3 requirements for ''linearity''. A function must satisfy all 3 to be called &quot;linear&quot;. 

#'''Additivity''': An input of &lt;math&gt;x_3(t) = x_1(t) + x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; results in an output of  &lt;math&gt;y_3(t) = y_1(t) + y_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;. 
#'''Homogeneity''': An input of &lt;math&gt;ax_1&lt;/math&gt; results in an output of &lt;math&gt;ay_1&lt;/math&gt;
#If x(t) = 0, y(t) = 0. 

&quot;Linear&quot; in this sense is not the same word as is used in conventional algebra or geometry. Specifically, linearity in signals applications has nothing to do with straight lines. Here is a small example:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = x(t) + 5&lt;/math&gt;

This function is not linear, because when x(t) = 0, y(t) = 5 (fails requirement 3). This may surprise people, because this equation is the equation for a straight line!

Being linear is also known in the literature as &quot;satisfying the principle of superposition&quot;. '''Superposition''' is a fancy term for saying that the system is additive and homogeneous. The terms linearity and superposition can be used interchangably, but in this book we will prefer to use the term linearity exclusively.

We can combine the three requirements into a single equation:
In a linear system, an input of &lt;math&gt;a_1x_1(t)+a_2x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; results in an output of &lt;math&gt;a_1y_1(t)+a_2y_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Additivity ===

A system is said to be additive if a sum of inputs results in a sum of outputs. To test for additivity, we need to create two arbitrary inputs, ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(t)''. We then use these inputs to produce two respective outputs:

:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = f(x_1(t))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2(t) = f(x_2(t))&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we need to take a sum of inputs, and prove that the system output is a sum of the previous outputs:

:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) + y_2(t) = f(x_1(t) + x_2(t))&lt;/math&gt;

If this final relationship is not satisfied for ''all possible inputs'', then the system is not additive.

=== Homogeneity ===

Similar to additivity, a system is homogeneous if a scaled input (multiplied by a constant) results in a scaled output. If we have two inputs to a system:

:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = f(x_1(t))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2(t) = f(x_2(t))&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:&lt;math&gt;x_1(t) = cx_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''c'' is an arbitrary constant. If this is the case then the system is homogeneous if

:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = cy_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;

for any arbitrary ''c''.

=== Time Invariance ===

If the input signal ''x(t)'' produces an output ''y(t)'' then any time shifted input, ''x(t + &amp;delta;)'', results in a time-shifted output ''y(t + &amp;delta;)''.

This property can be satisfied if the transfer function of the system is not a function of time except expressed by the input and output.

=== Example: Simple Time Invariance ===

{{TextBox|1=
To demonstrate how to determine if a system is time-invariant, consider the two systems:
* System A: &lt;math&gt;y(t) = t\, x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
* System B: &lt;math&gt;\,\!b(t) = 10 x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Since system A explicitly depends on ''t'' outside of ''x(t)'' and ''y(t)'', it is '''time-variant'''. System B, however, does not depend explicitly on ''t'' so it is time-invariant.
}}

=== Example: Formal Proof ===

{{TextBox|1=
A more formal proof of why systems A &amp; B from above are respectively time varying and time-invariant is now presented. To perform this proof, the second definition of time invariance will be used.

;System A:
:Start with a delay of the input &lt;math&gt;x_d(t) = \,\!x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y(t) = t\, x_d(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = t\, x_d(t) = t\, x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
:Now delay the output by &amp;delta;
::&lt;math&gt;y(t) = t\, x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_2(t) = \,\!y(t + \delta) = (t + \delta) x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
:Clearly &lt;math&gt;y_1(t) \,\!\ne y_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the system is not time-invariant.

;System B:
:Start with a delay of the input &lt;math&gt;x_d(t) = \,\!x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y(t) = 10 \, x_d(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = 10 \,x_d(t) = 10 \,x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
:Now delay the output by &amp;delta;
::&lt;math&gt;y(t) = 10 \,x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_2(t) = y(t + \delta) = 10 \,x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
:Clearly &lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = \,\!y_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the system is time-invariant.
}}

== Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Systems ==

The system is linear time-invariant (LTI) if it satisfies both the property of linearity and time-invariance. This book will study LTI systems almost exclusively, because they are the easiest systems to work with, and they are ideal to analyze and design.

== Other Function Properties ==

Besides being linear, or time-invariant, there are a number of other properties that we can identify in a function:

=== Memory ===

A system is said to have memory if the output from the system is dependent on past inputs (or future inputs) to the system. A system is called ''memoryless'' if the output is only dependent on the current input. Memoryless systems are easier to work with, but systems with memory are more common in digital signal processing applications.
A memory system is also called a dynamic system whereas a memoryless system is called a static system.

=== Causality ===

Causality is a property that is very similar to memory. A system is called '''causal''' if it is only dependent on past or current inputs. A system is called '''non-causal''' if the output of the system is dependent on future inputs. Most of the practical systems are causal.

=== Stability ===

Stability is a very important concept in systems, but it is also one of the hardest function properties to prove. There are several different criteria for system stability, but the most common requirement is that the system must produce a finite output when subjected to a finite input. For instance, if we apply 5 volts to the input terminals of a given circuit, we would like it if the circuit output didn't approach infinity, and the circuit itself didn't melt or explode. This type of stability is often known as &quot;Bounded Input, Bounded Output&quot; stability, or BIBO.

Studying BIBO stability is a relatively complicated course of study, and later books on the Electrical Engineering bookshelf will attempt to cover the topic.

== Linear Operators ==

Mathematical operators that satisfy the property of linearity are known as '''linear operators'''. Here are some common linear operators:

#Derivative
#Integral
#Fourier Transform

=== Example: Linear Functions  ===

{{TextBox|Determine if the following two functions are linear or not:

#&lt;math&gt;y(t) = \int^\infty_{-\infty} x(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;y(t) = \frac{d}{dt}x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Impulse Response ==

=== Zero-Input Response ===
:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h(t)=e^{-x}u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Zero-State Response ===
zero state response means transient response or natural response.

=== Second-Order Solution ===

*[[/System Response#Example 1|Example]]. Finding the total response of a driven RLC circuit.

== Convolution ==

{{Matlab CMD|conv}}

Convolution (folding together) is a complicated operation involving integrating, multiplying, adding, and time-shifting two signals together. Convolution is a key component to the rest of the material in this book.

The convolution ''a * b'' of two functions ''a'' and ''b'' is defined as the function:

:&lt;math&gt;(a*b)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty a(\tau)b(t - \tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

The greek letter &amp;tau; (tau) is used as the integration variable, because the letter ''t'' is already in use. &amp;tau; is used as a &quot;dummy variable&quot; because we use it merely to calculate the integral. 

In the convolution integral, all references to ''t'' are replaced with &amp;tau;, except for the ''-t'' in the argument to the function ''b''. Function ''b'' is ''time inverted'' by changing &amp;tau; to -&amp;tau;. Graphically, this process moves everything from the right-side of the ''y'' axis to the left side and vice-versa. Time inversion turns the function into a mirror image of itself.

Next, function ''b'' is ''time-shifted'' by the variable ''t''. Remember, once we replace everything with &amp;tau;, we are now computing in the ''tau domain'', and not in the time domain like we were previously. Because of this, ''t'' can be used as a shift parameter.

We multiply the two functions together, time shifting along the way, and we take the area under the resulting curve at each point. Two functions overlap in increasing amounts until some &quot;watershed&quot; after which the two functions overlap less and less. Where the two functions overlap in the ''t'' domain, there is a value for the convolution. If one (or both) of the functions do not exist over any given range, the value of the convolution operation at that range will be zero.

After the integration, the definite integral plugs the variable ''t'' back in for remaining references of the variable &amp;tau;, and we have a function of ''t'' again. It is important to remember that the resulting function will be a combination of the two input functions, and will share some properties of both.

=== Properties of Convolution === 

The convolution function satisfies certain conditions:

;Commutativity:
: &lt;math&gt;f * g = g * f \,&lt;/math&gt;

;Associativity:
: &lt;math&gt;f  * (g  * h) = (f  * g)  * h \,&lt;/math&gt;

;Distributivity:
: &lt;math&gt;f  * (g + h) = (f  * g) + (f  * h) \,&lt;/math&gt;

;Associativity With Scalar Multiplication:
: &lt;math&gt;a (f  * g) = (a f)  * g = f  * (a g) \,&lt;/math&gt;
for any real (or complex) number ''a''.

;Differentiation Rule
: &lt;math&gt;(f  * g)' = f' * g = f * g' \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 1===
{{TextBox|Find the convolution, ''z(t)'', of the following two signals, ''x(t)'' and ''y(t)'', by using (a) the integral representation of the convolution equation and (b) muliplication in the Laplace domain.

[[Image:Convolution Example 1 Signals.svg|center]]

The signal ''y(t)'' is simply the [[w:Heaviside step|Heaviside step]], ''u(t)''.

The signal ''x(t)'' is given by the following infinite sinusoid, ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'', and windowing function, ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'':

::&lt;math&gt;x_0(t)=\sin(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;x_w(t)=u(t)-u(t-2\pi)\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Convoution Example 1 x-Signal, Window.svg|center]]

Thus, the convolution we wish to perform is therefore:

::&lt;math&gt;z(t)=x(t) * y(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;z(t)=\sin(t) \left[ u(t)-u(t-2\pi) \right] * u(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;z(t)=\left[ \sin(t) u(t)- \sin(t)u(t-2\pi) \right] * u(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

From the distributive law:

::&lt;math&gt;z(t)=\sin(t) u(t) * u(t) - \sin(t)u(t-2\pi) * u(t) \, &lt;/math&gt;

== Correlation ==

{{Matlab CMD|xcorr}}

Akin to Convolution is a technique called &quot;Correlation&quot; that combines two functions in the time domain into a single resultant function in the time domain. Correlation is not as important to our study as convolution is, but it has a number of properties that will be useful nonetheless.

The correlation of two functions, ''g(t)'' and ''h(t)'' is defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{gh}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(\tau)h(t + \tau) d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Where the capital ''R'' is the '''Correlation Operator''', and the subscripts to ''R'' are the arguments to the correlation operation. 

We notice immediately that correlation is similar to convolution, except that we don't time-invert the second argument before we shift and integrate. Because of this, we can define correlation in terms of convolution, as such:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{gh}(t) = g(t) * h(-t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Uses of Correlation ===

Correlation is used in many places because it demonstrates one important fact: Correlation determines how much similarity there is between the two argument functions. The more the area under the correlation curve, the more is the similarity between the two signals.

=== Autocorrelation ===

The term &quot;autocorrelation&quot; is the name of the operation when a function is correlated with itself. The autocorrelation is denoted when both of the subscripts to the Correlation operator are the same:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{xx}(t) = x(t) * x(-t)&lt;/math&gt;

While it might seem ridiculous to correlate a function with itself, there are a number of uses for autocorrelation that will be discussed later. Autocorrelation satisfies several important properties:

#The maximum value of the autocorrelation always occurs at ''t = 0''. The function always decreases (or stays constant) as ''t'' approaches infinity. 
#Autocorrelation is symmetric about the ''x'' axis.

=== Crosscorrelation ===

Cross correlation is every instance of correlation that is not considered &quot;autocorrelation&quot;. In general, crosscorrelation occurs when the function arguments to the correlation are not equal. Crosscorrelation is used to find the similarity between two signals.

=== Example: RADAR ===

{{TextBox|RADAR is a system that uses pulses of electromagnetic waves to determine the position of a distant object. RADAR operates by sending out a signal, and then listening for echos. If there is an object in range, the signal will bounce off that object and return to the RADAR station. The RADAR will then take the cross correlation of two signals, the sent signal and the received signal. A spike in the cross correlation signal indicates that an object is present, and the location of the spike indicates how much time has passed (and therefore how far away the object is).}}</text>

      <comment>/* White Noise */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Signals and Systems Page}}

Noise is an unfortunate phenomenon that is the greatest single enemy of an electrical engineer. Without noise, digital communication rates would increase almost to infinity.

== White Noise ==

White Noise, or Gaussian Noise is called white because it affects all the frequency components of a signal equally. This noise can be modeled as a Gaussian noise process. Gaussian processes are stochastic processes for which the random variables are jointly Gaussian. We don't talk about Frequency Domain analysis till a later chapter, but it is important to know this terminology now.

== Colored Noise ==

Colored noise is different from white noise in that it affects different frequency components differently. For example, Pink Noise is random noise with an equal amount of power in each frequency octave band.

== White Noise and Autocorrelation ==

White Noise is completely random, so it would make intuitive sense to think that White Noise has zero autocorrelation. As the noise signal is time shifted, there is no correlation between the values. In fact, there is no correlation at all until the point where t = 0, and the noise signal perfectly overlaps itself. At this point, the correlation spikes upward. In other words, the autocorrelation of noise is an [[Signals and Systems/Engineering Functions/Impulse Function|Impulse Function]] centered at the point t = 0.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}[n(t), n(t)] = \delta(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where n(t) is the noise signal.

== Noise Power ==

Noise signals have a certain amount of energy associated with them. The more energy and transmitted power that a noise signal has, the more interference the noise can cause in a transmitted data signal. We will talk more about the power associated with noise in later chapters.

== Thermal Noise ==

Thermal noise is a fact of life for electronics. As components heat up, the resistance of resistors change, and even the capacitance and inductance of energy storage elements can be affected. This change amounts to noise in the circuit output. In this chapter, we will study the effects of thermal noise.

The ''thermal noise'' or ''white noise'' or ''Johnson noise'' is the random noise which is generated in a resistor or the resistive component of a complex impedance due to rapid and random motion of the molecules, atoms and electrons.
According to the kinetic theory of thermodynamics, the temperature of a particle denotes its internal kinetic energy. This means that the temperature of a body expresses the rms value of the velocity of motion of the particles in a body. As per this kinetic theory, the kinetic energy of these particles becomes approximately zero (i.e. zero velocity) at absolute zero.
Therefore, the noise power produced in a resistor is proportional to its absolute temperature. Also the noise power is proportional to the bandwidth over which the noise is measured.
Therefore the expression for maximum noise power output of a resistor may be given as:
 
:&lt;math&gt;Pn=k \cdot T \cdot B&lt;/math&gt;

where
: k is Boltzmann's  constant 
: T is the absolute temperature, in Kelvin degrees
: B is the bandwidth of interest, in Hertz.</text>

== Periodic Signals ==

A signal is a periodic signal if it completes a pattern within a measurable time frame, called a period and repeats that pattern over identical  subsequent periods.  The completion of a full pattern is called a cycle.  A period is defined as the amount of time (expressed in seconds) required to complete one full cycle.  The duration of a period represented by T, may be different for each signal but it is constant for any given periodic signal.

== Terminology ==

We will discuss here some of the common terminology that pertains to a periodic function. Let ''g(t)'' be a periodic function satisfying ''g(t + T) = g(t)'' for all ''t''.

=== Period ===

The '''period''' is the smallest value of ''T'' satisfying ''g(t + T) = g(t)'' for all ''t''. The period is defined so because if ''g(t + T) = g(t)'' for all ''t'', it can be verified that ''g(t + T') = g(t)'' for all ''t'' where ''T' = 2T, 3T, 4T, ...'' 
In essence, it's the smallest amount of time it takes for the function to repeat itself. If the period of a function is finite, the function is called &quot;periodic&quot;. Functions that never repeat themselves have an infinite period, and are known as &quot;aperiodic functions&quot;.

The period of a periodic waveform will be denoted with a capital ''T''. The period is measured in seconds.

=== Frequency ===

The frequency of a periodic function is the number of complete cycles that can occur per second. Frequency is denoted with a lower-case ''f''. It is defined in terms of the period, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

Frequency has units of ''hertz'' or cycle per second.

=== Radial Frequency ===

The radial frequency is the frequency in terms of radians. it is defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f&lt;/math&gt;

=== Amplitude ===

The amplitude of a given wave is the value of the wave at that point. Amplitude is also known as the &quot;Magnitude&quot; of the wave at that particular point. There is no particular variable that is used with amplitude, although capital A, capital M and capital R are common.

The amplitude can be measured in different units, depending on the signal we are studying. In an electric signal the amplitude will typically be measured in volts. In a building or other such structure, the amplitude of a vibration could be measured in meters.

=== Continuous Signal ===

A continuous signal is a &quot;smooth&quot; signal, where the signal is defined over a certain range. For example, a sine function is a continuous signal, as is an exponential function or a constant function. A portion of a sine signal over a range of time 0 to 6 seconds is also continuous. Examples of functions that are not continuous would be any discrete signal, where the value of the signal is only defined at certain intervals.

=== DC Offset ===

A ''DC Offset'' is an amount by which the average value of the periodic function is not centered around the ''x''-axis.

A periodic signal has a DC offset component if it is not centered about the ''x''-axis. In general, the DC value is the amount that must be subtracted from the signal to center it on the ''x''-axis. by definition:

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 = (1/T)*\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

With ''A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' being the DC offset. If ''A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0'', the function is centered and has no offset.

=== Half-wave Symmetry ===

To determine if a signal with period 2''L'' has half-wave symmetry, we need to examine a single period of the signal. If, when shifted by half the period, the signal is found to be the negative of the original signal, then the signal has half-wave symmetry. That is, the following property is satisfied:

::&lt;math&gt;f (t-L) = - f (t)\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Half-wave Symmetry.svg|center]]

Half-wave symmetry implies that the second half of the wave is exactly opposite to the first half. A function with half-wave symmetry does not have to be even or odd, as this property requires only that the shifted signal is opposite, and this can occur for any temporal offset. However, it does require that the DC offset is zero, as one half must exactly cancel out the other. If the whole signal has a DC offset, this cannot occur, as when one half is added to the other, the offsets will add, not cancel.

Note that if a signal is symmetric about the the half-period point, it is ''not'' necessarily half-wave symmetric. An example of this is the function ''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, periodic on [-1,1), which has no DC offset and odd symmetry about ''t''=0. However, when shifted by 1, the signal is ''not'' opposite to the original signal.

=== Quarter-Wave Symmetry ===

If a signal has the following properties, it is said to quarter-wave symmetric:
*It is half-wave symmetric.
*It has symmetry (odd or even) about the quarter-period point (i.e. at a distance of L/2 from an end or the centre).

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|[[Image:Quarter-wave_Symmetry_Even.svg|center|400px]]
|[[Image:Quarter-wave_Symmetry_Odd.svg|center|400px]]
|-
|'''Even Signal with Quarter-Wave Symmetry'''
|'''Odd Signal with Quarter-Wave Symmetry'''
|}

Any quarter-wave symmetric signal can be made even or odd by shifting it up or down the time axis. A signal does not have to be odd or even to be quarter-wave symmetric, but in order to find the quarter-period point, the signal will need to be shifted up or down to make it so. Below is an example of a quarter-wave symmetric signal (red) that does not show this property without first being shifted along the time axis (green, dashed):

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|[[Image:Quarter-wave_Symmetry_Assymmetric.svg|center|400px]]
|-
|'''Asymmetric Signal with Quarter-Wave Symmetry'''
|}

An equivalent operation is shifting the interval the function is defined in. This may be easier to reconcile with the formulae for Fourier series. In this case, the function would be redefined to be periodic on (''-L+&amp;Delta;'',''L+&amp;Delta;''), where &amp;Delta; is the shift distance.

=== Discontinuities ===

'''Discontinuities''' are an artifact of some signals that make them difficult to manipulate for a variety of reasons.

In a graphical sense, a periodic signal has discontinuities whenever there is a vertical line connecting two adjacent values of the signal. In a more mathematical sense, a periodic signal has discontinuities anywhere that the function has an undefined (or an infinite) derivative. These are also places where the function does not have a limit, because the values of the limit from both directions are not equal.

== Common Periodic Signals ==

There are some common periodic signals that are given names of their own. We will list those signals here, and discuss them.

=== Sinusoid ===

The quintessential periodic waveform. These can be either Sine functions, or Cosine Functions.

=== Square Wave ===

The square wave is exactly what it sounds like: a series of rectangular pulses spaced equidistant from each other, each with the same amplitude.

=== Triangle Wave ===

The triangle wave is also exactly what it sounds like: a series of triangles. These triangles may touch each other, or there may be some space in between each wavelength.

=== Example: Sinusoid, Square, and Triangle Waves ===

{{TextBox|Here is an image that shows some of the common periodic waveforms, a triangle wave, a square wave, a sawtooth wave, and a sinusoid.

[[Image:Waveforms.png|400px|center]]
}}

== Classifications ==

Periodic functions can be classified in a number of ways. one of the ways that they can be classified is according to their symmetry. A function may be Odd, Even, or Neither Even nor Odd. All periodic functions can be classified in this way.

=== Even ===

Functions are even if they are symmetrical about the ''y''-axis.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = f(-x)&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, a cosine function is an even function.

=== Odd ===

A function is odd if it is inversely symmetrical about the ''y''-axis.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = -f(-x)&lt;/math&gt;

The Sine function is an odd function.

=== Neither Even nor Odd ===

Some functions are neither even nor odd. However, such functions can be written as a sum of even and odd functions. Any function ''f(x)'' can be expressed as a sum of an odd function and an even function:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = 1/2 \{f(x) + f(-x)\} + 1/2 \{f(x) - f(-x)\} &lt;/math&gt;

We leave it as an exercise to the reader to verify that the first component is even and that the second component is odd. Note that the first term is zero for odd functions and that the second term is zero for even functions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Omaha is often played high-low split. The player may use any combination of exactly two holecards and exactly three boardcards for the high hand and another (or the same) combination of exactly two holecards and exactly three boardcards for the low hand.

==Rules==
# All the rules of Omaha apply to Omaha high-low split except as below.
# A qualifier of 8-or-better for low is used. This means to win the low half of the pot, a player’s hand at the showdown must have five cards of different ranks that are an eight or lower in rank. (An ace is the highest card and also the lowest card.) If there is no qualifying hand for low, the best high hand wins the whole pot.

== pipe trick ==

I discovered a little trick. Stop me if you've heard this one before.

Often &quot;normal&quot; links to an article (putting square brackets around the article name)
don't look quite right in normal running text.
The article name includes extra disambiguation stuff before the colon, or inside parentheses, that's a bit jarring.

Adding a single pipe character to the link strips out that extra stuff, leaving the &quot;normal&quot; name, which is very often exactly what we wanted.

2 examples:

# [[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# [[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties|Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties|Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# [[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties|Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

# [[w:Hyperion (moon)]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Hyperion (moon)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# [[w:Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''(what people write when they don't know the pipe trick)''
# [[w:Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Hyperion (moon)|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''(what people write when they do know the pipe trick)''

(I wouldn't bother converting from the 2nd form to the more compact 3rd form, since they both look identical to readers, unless I was editing the link anyway.)

Keep on making those good wikibook edits.

Hey, Kernigh, why are you changing site-wide templates without asking anyone for opinion?

BTW, you are doing strange things, like replacing CSS classes: &quot;notice&quot; and &quot;metadata&quot; (preventing template from being printed) by noneixisting class &quot;top&quot;. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:02, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

I'm wondering why you still haven't requested for adminship here and noone has nominated you. IMO you're doing lots of cleanup work here and such permissions would allow to make many things easier and faster. You are doing good nominations for speedy deletion, revert vandalism quite often and clean up old pages. It will be your fourth month here. Looking at your contributions, you are a reasonable person so, all in all, I think you are good material for a sysop. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:37, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

:At 28 December 2005, I created [[Bugzilla:4414]]. I had lost the ability to view deleted edit histories. The bug closed with &quot;Please discuss the issue with the enwikibooks community,&quot; at which point I understood that it was not a bug, it was a decision by developers to delegate decisions to communities.

:In January, I started thinking that it would be convenient if I could delete certain pages instead of using {{tl|delete}}. A request for adminship at [[WB:RFA]] is a way for me to ask Wikibookians whether they would let me delete pages and read their histories. I will do a request for adminship when I have time. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:58, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

== [[m:Transwiki:Wikimania05]] ==

I got a major complaint today about the transwiki of this Wikibook to Meta, and the user is so pissed that he invoked Jimbo.  I basically replied &quot;bring it on!  I'd love to see Jimbo try to defend this Wikibook.&quot;

I sorta doubt that Jimbo is going to be so forceful, but I finished off the transwiki yesterday with deleting all of the Wikimania content.  I suggested that he put up a proposal on [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]] if he really is that pissed over the whole thing.  This is an FYI because your name is attached to a part of the transwiki to Meta.

I knew I was stepping on some &quot;powerful&quot; toes by doing a transwiki of this content, and I'll see just how independent we as a Wikibooks community really are going to be with this transfer.  This book should not have been here in the first place, and I did complain about it back elsewhen.  I think I have a stronger backbone on this now, and am willing to even go against board members (who BTW encouraged the Wikimania content to be added in the first place to Wikibooks).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:05, 10 February 2006 (UTC)
: This was a fair bit of work.  I don't see this as stepping on toes so much as being courteous to current users of the content; replacing this page with a stub that points visitors to the right place (and protecting it), &amp;c.  
: Meta is a fine place to have the proceedings end up.  I am not sure which board members you feel encouraged the proceedings to be added to Wikibooks last summer; I seem to recall it being the book-like nature of traditional conference proceedings that suggested using WB in the first place. [[User:Sj|Sj]] 07:10, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

::The board members who encouraged this to be on Wikibooks were Anthere and Angela.  Both contributed to it here on Wikibooks, and certainly did not raise any objection to it, dispite a strong protest by Aya at the time.  I didn't know that at the time, but after I was about half way through the process of deleting the content did I notice both names on the edit history log of many of the pages, as I noticed yours as well, SJ.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:02, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

BTW, I guess I need to thank you at least partically for your defense of my removal of this content.  There are more pages that Brion restored that need to be deleted as well, but you provided a good start.  And thanks for the redirects as well.  I've been a stick in the mud about the redirects mainly because of the &quot;demands&quot; that '''I''' perform the action instead of one of the Wikimania participants stepping in and doing it themselves.  It didn't require sysop privileges to add the redirects.  Thanks anyway, and I hope this whole thing quiets down real soon.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:02, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

Kernigh. I thought I would write you concerning my RFA. I thought I would ask (and hope) that you would reconsider your vote of Oppose. While I know my contributions weighs heavy to my own project, if you look closely you will see where I have contributed to other projects (primarily with suggestions and comments.) I have taken your advice and began watching the locations you have suggested. I will admit I am not a die hard vandal hunter, I feel I can be an asset in taking what I've learned from Wikibooks and help others to improve their materials. I guess I could become a major vandal hunter if that's what it takes to help others with development, but I feel that my assistance in the area of development would be my strength. I completely understand if you choose not to, but I thought I would at least ask for your consideration. Thanks.--[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 10:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
==Deleting Things On Wikipedia==
Over there, the tag for speedies is {{tl|csd}} and has to meet certain requirements, some of which are fairly contreversial and undefined. If it doesn't meet speedy requirements, it goes into a certain area (Articles For Deletion, Redirects For Deletion, Stubs For Deletion, Miscellaneous For Deletion, Templates For Deletion, etc.), although that varies from place to place and depending on who closes the debate, unfortunately.

== [[Lord of the Flies]] and failed Google test ==

I've gone through the history of the content for this Wikibook, and I am convinced that the bundle of other web pages are all copies of the content that was originally developed here on Wikibooks.  The first edit was done back in April 2004 (almost two years ago) and subsequent additions of content was very piecemeal with almost 300 different unique edits to this page.  While there may have been some recent additions that did copy from perhaps previous copyrighted material, this Wikibook doesn't seem to be the problem here.  Instead, I think these other websites are violating '''our''' copyright at Wikibooks, for failure to disclose the GFDL and acknowledging that Wikibooks is the ''source'' of this material.

I'd like to dig up some more information about this, but I think you found a really good copyright violation I'd like to hand over to the Wikimedia legal team.  I'm sure a couple of appropriate letters sent to a couple of website owners about misuse of Wikibooks content....  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:05, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== RuneScape Cheats ==

Hey man. In votes for deletion, you said this about the RuneScape Cheats article.

The bot community is trying [http://www.aryanrune.com/terms.html to make contractually illegal the informing of JAGex or the public about bots]; maybe we should mention that somewhere in the book.

I don't fully understand what you're saying there. Can you go further into detail please?? Richard 01:37, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

: To write a Wikibook module about RuneScape cheating robots, or to verify that the mentioned bots actually exist, one would need to research them. However at this time I guess that JAGeX has suppressed most cheating bots, and their remaining users are hiding behind forums such as aryanrune, and applying terms of use that impede anyone from describing these bots in public.

: The most problematic part of their terms reads, ''In these Terms and Conditions &quot;images&quot; refers to the images used by the domain and host of AryanRune.com. To view any image on fagex.net or its server that it is hosted on, '''you must not be in any way affiliated with Jagex Ltd you must not be affiliated with RuneScape''' and/or Employed by either. / Viewing the images on the site means you are in no way trying to '''report''', send, capture or scan this sites server or images.''

: For now, I ignore the difference between AryanRune.com and fagex.net. These terms not only bar JAGeX/RuneScape from accessing the &quot;images&quot;, they also bar third parties &amp;ndash; such as Wikibook authors &amp;ndash; from describing (&quot;report&quot;) the contents of the images.

: However, it is also possible that I only misinterpreted the terms. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:07, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

==[[Mythology/Greek Mythology]] and [[Greek Mythology]]==
Hi, back in February, you expressed a desire to merge these two books together.

The only pages that still need to be merged are [[Talk:Mythology/Greek Mythology]] and [[Talk:Greek Mythology]]. Now the only issue that remains is whether the book should be part of [[Mythology]] or stand on its own. I'll leave that up to you to decide.

Hello.  I saw your message and see how the format works. I'm doing well so far, I believe.  I had 6 of the 17 levels pre-written, which is why progress was so fast.  I intend to reword some things to make them not be first person.

But before this, I was wondering if maybe you could do something about, like make it on a 'high risk for vandilism' or something that can keep it watched often. It's just so annoying to see everyday that someone messed up the page. Thanks for the help you've done before, and maybe you could do this last thing.

You are certainly welcome to reverse that for your own page, but I felt that would be a good general protection to you in this situation, especially since you have admin authority anyway to do what you want on these pages.

== Wikibooks Embassy and technical help ==

Kernigh,

I started an [[English Embassy]] page, which is pretty much a copy of the english wikipedia's embassy page. I was wondering, if it should be [[Wikibooks:English Embassy]] instead, or anything like that. Also, I would like to ask people who speak other languages if they would like to list themselves on the page, to be available for any non-english speaking people who would need help- I was wondering, should I look at the different language categories and ask people on their personal page, or just post on the staff lounge?(I don't want to keep posting stuff there every day if it isn't appropriate)

Also, I have been preparing to contribute to the [[Russian]] Language wikibook, but don't know much about using templates and making boxes(you know, the things that make wikibooks look pretty). I was wondering, are there people out there who can make a bland wikibook look better as content is being added, based on the needs of the wikibook? Maybe I should ask about it in the staff lounge too, I don't know. I basically am asking you this because you seem to know what you're doing more than anyone else here. Thanks in advance, [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 19:58, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

==[[:Image:Wikiversity-logo-zs.png]]==
I clarified the legalities of the licensing issue at Wikipedia commons for [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Wikiversity-logo-zs.png Wikiversity-logo-zs.png]. I hope this helps.

Basically, the licensing is the only thing that matters. The owner can grant as many licenses to use his image as he wants. Each license can have its own stipulations. He granted one license to the world under the GNU FDL and another license to me to make the logo. The logo license was issued separately and directly from the owner, and is therefore not subject to the GNU FDL. For that reason, I can grant propriety rights to the logo to the Wikimedia foundation. --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 16:49, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

== Videogame transwikiing method ==

In various postings you've mentioned your search for a transwikiing aid. [[mw:MWDumper|MWDumper]] seems to be the answer. It can search an archive and extract pages based on a filter list, so all you need is a full dump. I've been testing its accuracy and so far I haven't come across any problems.

This is the tool StrategyWiki is going to use, and I've already begun creating [http://strategywiki.net/wiki/StrategyWiki:Wikibooks_Import_List automated filters] for it to aid transwikiing. These are written in a compatible raw format; they can be pasted straight into a .txt for MWDumper's consumption. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:08, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
:Actually, what I am interested in is a way to remove guides from this wiki, Wikibooks, after transwiki. Currently, if we move a guide to Strategy Wiki or elsewhere, then it is a fork; a copy remains at Wikibooks. I would like to have a Wikibooks policy that allows us to delete these guides.
:[[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] already allows us to use {{tl|transwiki}} to delete stuff, but that only applies for transwikis to other Wikimedia projects. However, if most Wikibookians support it, then we can change the deletion policy to let us delete moved computer and video game guides. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 18:51, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
::Oh, now I get what you're talking about! Well, I can't see anything like that being passed through any time soon what with all this chaos. In the meantime you could list them on Vfd. Since they now breach [[WB:WIW]] (or at least Jimbo's revision of it) the lack of a matching clause in the deletion policy is immaterial.

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:35, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

==empty pages==
well, to tell the truth, i didnt understand anything you said, sorry. but i didnt create empty pages.... if you go to edit, youll see that stuff is there, i just havent added all the data yet, so i hid the stuff with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;--!&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; so that it would be easier to add all the data later.... but thanks for deleting them without talking to me first... thatll be a biiiigg help... -[[User:Xornok|Xornok]] 13:11, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

==Reply from Yunzhong Hou==

Thanks for replying to the discussion page on the StarCraft Wikibook. You are the first person since my series of revisions to leave a comment, and I was becoming desperate. 

I would like to point out to you that my High Templar page on Wikipedia is more than a 'poorly written article'; it survived the Deletion proposal by overwhelming votes, and many of the voters agreed with me that the StarCraft articles should be transferred to Wikibooks because doing so will make the subject's various pages more coherent. Although the task is daunting, I have already transwikified my High Templar page and many others. 

However, I do agree with you that some components of the page are a bit irrelevant or crude, in which case I would be happy to make any changes that you deem important. If you can, please find people who may be interested in editing the StarCraft Wikibook. I know only a few Wikipedes. Thanks! --[[User:Yunzhong Hou|Yunzhong Hou]] 02:40, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

== Templates vs. screenshots ==

Hello there.  You were the one who initially spoke to me about the [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)]] book and ways to go about doing it.  I've done some more work on it and I wanted to ask you:  I've come up with a new template to assist in the guide.  What I was doing before was posting screenshots, but using the template I can lay out things and hopefully eliminate screenshots.  My question is:  What is better?  The template of the screenshots?  The template could be applied to future books, though the screenshots are quick and simple.

* One page that is using the new template is [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)/Level 3|This one]]
* One page that is using the screenshot system is [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)/Level 2|This one]]

I would like to hear from you about your opinion as you are an administrator and I don't want to get ahead of myself.  Thank you.  --[[User:Sivak|Sivak]] 05:42, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

==Vicious circle==

I noticed that on [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] you seemed to support enforcement. There is a vicious circle occurring in Wikibooks Policies where the absence of an accepted policy on voting (see [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]]) can be used to prevent votes from becoming enforced. It seems to me that unless we get [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]] enforced we cannot get any other policy enforced. This is fine for the moment but I have looked over the wall at Wikipedia....  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:20, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

: I commented on '''[[Wikibooks talk:No personal attacks]]''', where I wrote, &quot;I prefer that we have only one policy to deal with user behaviour (limiting insults against users, implementing consistent voting rules, resolving various disputes) instead of creating so many pages.&quot; --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:27, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;accredited institution&quot; ==

You might want to read the comments I left for Rob at [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#How_To_Build_A_Pykrete_Bong]]. It seems WMF is not internally consistent about its mission for WB. Jimbo obviously has a particular view and could likely make that WMF policy, but it is definitely not 100% clear. I assume you've also read [[w:User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Wikibooks_Howtos]].

==[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] Change of text==

You voted for enforcement of [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]. The text of this policy has been changed by [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] during the vote, I have further modified these changes to restore some of the original &quot;bite&quot;. This is highly unusual but without these changes [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] is unwilling to allow the policy to move to enforced. I am happy that the changes are not sufficiently substantial to undermine the policy, if you disagree then please make your views known. Changes to text during a vote could be construed as a delaying tactic so I have proposed a move to &quot;enforced&quot; status by 1st June. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:05, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

Hallo Kernigh, 
I've written a comment on http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer_Diskussion:Kernigh regarding the topic. In short: no, http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_Dokumentation is not a copy of http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual.de/Handbuch, but I've written text as well for de.wikibooks.org as for mediawiki.blender.org. http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Soylentgreen

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:48, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Your De-Adminship ==

Hello. I would like to inform you that you will have your sysop rights removed here on 8 Oct 2007 due to inactivity. If you would like to discuss the matter, please see [[WB:RFA]]. You can re-apply for adminship at a later date if you wish. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:06, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>Added a thing to note...</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is the structure of a typical build.xml file:

   &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
   &lt;project name=&quot;MyFirstAntProject&quot; default=&quot;MyTarget&quot;&gt;
      &lt;target name=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
         &lt;echo&gt;Running target init&lt;/echo&gt;
      &lt;/target&gt;
      &lt;target name=&quot;MyTarget&quot; depends=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
         &lt;echo&gt;Running target MyTarget&lt;/echo&gt;
      &lt;/target&gt;
   &lt;/project&gt;

Here are a few things to note:

# The Begin and End tags for project (&lt;project&gt; and &lt;/project&gt;) MUST start and end the file.
# The Begin &lt;project&gt; MUST have an attribute called default which is the name of one of the targets.
# Each build file must have at least one target.
# The Begin and End tags for &lt;target&gt; and &lt;/target&gt; must also match EXACTLY.
# Each target MUST have a name.
# Targets depend only on other targets and reference them by their target name.  Targets NEVER depend on projects or tasks.
# Target depends are optional.
# Anything between &lt;echo&gt; and &lt;/echo&gt; tags is outputted to the console if the surrounding target is called.
# Every task has to be in a target.

You can execute this from a DOS or UNIX command prompt by creating a file called build.xml and typing:

   ant

Ant will search for the build file in the current directory and run the build.xml file.

Here is a sample output of this build:

   Buildfile: C:\AntClass\Lab01\build.xml
   init:
        [echo] Running target init
   MyTarget:
        [echo] Running target MyTarget
   BUILD SUCCESSFUL
   Total time: 188 milliseconds

Optionally you can also pass ant the name of the target to run as a command line argument

   ant init

Which triggers only the init target

   Buildfile: C:\AntClass\Lab01\build.xml
   init:
        [echo] Running target init
   BUILD SUCCESSFUL
   Total time: 188 milliseconds

      <text xml:space="preserve">Where to go from here.

I am trying to rethink how children learn history.  Instead of taking the easy way out, and following chronology, I am trying to think about what is really important.  

I've written so far about the big changes in history.  I think the next thing to write about is the Twentieth Century.  I remember taking &quot;modern history&quot; in college, and being disappointed because we never got to the Twentieth Century.  For a long time, I knew more about ancient Babylon than I knew about World War I.  I think kids want to know (and need to know) about the history their fathers and mothers and grandparents lived through. [[User:Rick Norwood|Rick Norwood]] 20:25, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

Hi, I stumbled across this page and I think it was done very well! The only thing was that the format was a little bit intimidating, so I broke it down into smaller bits to make it easier to read. If there is any problem with how I edited things feel free to revert it. --[[User:Sanitized|Sanitized]] ([[User talk:Sanitized|talk]]) 19:13, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

I would like to re-start this project. I am thinking of adding broad topics first (i.e. methods and uses of history research, philosophy of history and history of human society). Focusing, like the original author of the project, on the non-linear presentation of history.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The discussion of user defined types should come before that of using classes and objects, as they are conceptually and programmatically much simpler to use. 

There should primarily be discussion of the 'dot' notation, perhaps even before anything else, as the notation is used without explanation in previous pages. In fact the dot notation can be used to identify both UDTs and Objects in VB.

It should also be shown what Object type variables actually are: that is, pointers to memory.  This will help explain how Objects are passed by reference (or by value) to functions and what happens when you assign one object to another.

Examples of some common VB objects you might use in a program (such as the Debug object or Controls on a Form or Collections), should be given.

How to write a class from scratch should then be discussed; and how these objects can be instantiated and how object lifetimes (reference counting) works in practice.  This will include such areas as the prefered use of the New keyword and what happens when Object variables go out of scope and with circular references.

Lastly the use of visibility of functions (methods) and variables or properties (properties), and the difference between Private, Public and Friend keywords.

Some advanced topics (maybe for other sections) should include authoring DLLs, COM objects (and GUIDs), default methods (and the use of the 'bang' ! operator) and enumerators (for use in For Each loops).

I shall write some of this perhaps, when I have some time...

This section over-uses the first-person perspective, which goes against Wiki standards and makes it awkward to edit.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">For reversing a string, very slightly optimized version from that given would be:

 Private Function ReverseStr(ByVal IPStr As String) As String
   Dim i As Integer
   For i = 1 To Len(IPStr)
     ReverseStr = Mid$(IPStr, i, 1) &amp; ReverseStr
   Next
 End Function

The changes are that the index (i) goes forward instead of backwards.  But the characters are added backwards instead of forwards.

If you really want to optimize it, create the string once with the proper length, so it is only allocated once. The above code would mean one (behind-the-scenes) call to SysReAllocString per loop iteration. Like this...

 Private Function ReverseStr(ByVal IPStr As String) As String
   Dim i As Long, j As Long, n As Long
   n = Len(IPStr)
   j = n
   ReverseStr = Space$(n)
   For i = 1 To Len(IPStr)
     Mid$(ReverseStr, i, 1) = Mid$(IPStr, j, 1)
     j = j - 1
   Next
 End Function

== need for help ==

Hello Sir
Since you are in contact with experts in computer programming, I kindly ask you for TWO favors: 
FIRST: I want to build an application having a command button that can connect me through my modem to my ISP: IDM. Please, can you tell me what are the instructions that must be put in the code of the cmd if I am using Visual Basic 6.0???

SECOND: If I want to load the Dial-up connection in the Network Connections folder, I cannot construct the path that I should include in the &quot;Shell&quot; instruction. What is the path to the Dial-up connection?
 
Your help is highly appreciated and I thank you in advance.
Best Regards
Please e-mail me the answer if you don't mind

= Subderivations and Discharge Rules =

As already seen, we need three more inference rules, Conditional Introduction (CI), Negation Introduction (NI), and Negation Elimination (NE).  These require subderivations.

=== Example derivation ===

We begin with an example derivation which illustrates Conditional Introduction.  We will provide a derivation for the argument

Lines 3 and 4 constitute a subderivation.  It starts by assuming desired formula's antecedent and ends by deriving the desired formula's consequent.  There are two vertical fences between the line numbers and the formulae to set it off from the rest of the derivation and to indicate its subordinate status.  Line 3 has a horizontal fence under it to separate the assumption from the rest of the subderivation.  Line 5 is the application of Conditional Introduction.  It follows not from one or two lines but from the subderivation (lines 3&amp;ndash;4) as a whole.

Conditional Introduction is a ''discharge rule''.  It discharges (makes inactive) that assumption and indeed makes the entire subderivation inactive.  Once we applyed a discharge rule, no line from the subderivaiton (here, lines 3 and 4) can be further used in the derivation.

=== The Conditional Introduction rule ===

Conditional Introduction (CI)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{Assume\ \varphi,\ derive\ \psi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the consequent line is not inferred from one or more antecedent lines, but from a subderivation as a whole.  The annotation is the range of lines occupied by the subderivation and the abbreviation CI.  Note that the antecedent subderivation can consist of a single line serving both as the assumed &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and the derived &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as in the following derivation of

: '''&amp;there4;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike previously introduced inference rules, Conditional Introduction cannot be justified by a truth table.  Rather it is justified by the Deduction Principle introduced at [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Properties of Sentential Connectives#Deduction principle|Properties of Sentential Connectives]].

Lines 3 through 6 constitute a subderivation.  It starts by assuming the desired formula's opposite and ends by assuming a contradiction (a formula and its negation).  As before, there are two vertical fences between the line numbers and the formulae to set it off from the rest of the derivation and to indicate its subordinate status.  And the horizontal fence under line 3 again separates the assumption from the rest of the subderivation.  Line 9, which follows from the entire subderivation, is the application of Negation Introduction.

At line 9, note that the annotation '5 DI' would be incorrect.  Although inferring &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is valid by DI, line 5 is no longer active when we get to line 9.  Thus we are not allowed to derive anything from line 5 at that point.

=== The Negation Introduction rule ===

Negation Introduction (NI)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{Assume\ \varphi,\ derive\ \psi\ and\ \lnot \psi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The consequent line is inferred from the whole subderivation.  The annotation is the range of lines occupied by the subderivation and the abbreviation is NI.  Negation Introduction sometimes goes by the Latin name ''Reductio ad Absurdum'' or sometimes by ''Proof by Contradiction''.

Like Conditional Introduction, Negation Introduction cannot be justified by a truth table.  Rather it is justified by the Reductio Principle introduced at [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Properties of Sentential Connectives#Deduction principle|Properties of Sentential Connectives]].

=== Another example derivation ===

To illustrate Negation Elimination, we will provide a derivation for the argument

Lines 2 through 4 constitute a subderivation.  As in the previous example, it starts by assuming the desired formula's opposite and ends by assuming a contradiction (a formula and its negation).  Line 5, which follows from the entire subderivation, is the application of Negation Elimination.

=== The Negation Elimination rule ===

Negation Elimination (NE)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{Assume\ \lnot \varphi,\ derive\ \psi\ and\ \lnot \psi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The consequent line is inferred from the whole subderivation.  The annotation is the range of lines occupied by the subderivation and the abbreviation is NE.  Like Negation Introduction, Negation Elimination sometimes goes by the Latin name ''Reductio ad Absurdum'' or sometimes by ''Proof by Contradiction''.

Like Negation Introduction, Negation Elimination is justified by the Reductio Principle introduced at [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Properties of Sentential Connectives#Deduction principle|Properties of Sentential Connectives]].  This rule's place in the Introduction/Elimination naming convention is somewhat more awkward than for the other rules.  Unlike the other elimination rules, the negation that gets eliminated by this rule does not occur in an already derived line.  Rather the eliminated negation occurs in the assumption of the subderivation.

== Terminology ==

The inference rules introduced in this module, Conditional Introduction and Negation Introduction, are discharge rules.  For lack of a better term, we can call the inference rules introduced in [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Inference Rules|Inference Rules]] 'standard rules'.  A ''standard rule'' is an inference rule whose antecedent is a set of lines.  A ''discharge rule'' is an inference rule whose antecedent is a subderivation.

The ''depth'' of a line in a derivation is the number of fences standing between the line number and the formula.  All lines of a derivation have a depth of at least one.  Each temporary assumption increases the depth by one.  Each discharge rule decreases the depth by one.

An ''active line'' is a line that is available for use as an antecedent line for a standard inference rule.  In particular, it is a line whose depth is less than or equal to the depth of the current line.  An inactive line is a line that is not active.

A discharge rule is said to ''discharge'' an assumption.  It makes all lines in its antecedent subderivation inactive.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==COBOL==
{{Wikipedia|COBOL}}

COBOL is a computer programming language whose name is an acronym formed by the upper-case letters of the words &quot;COmmon Business-Oriented Language&quot;.  It is widely used in the financial services industry typically for mainframe based applications. It has been used extensively since the 1960s. COBOL was designed for use in business applications and consequently it was implemented with fixed-point arithmetic support. This is one of the advantages of COBOL as it allows complete and accurate computation of financial values without the possibility of rounding errors.

===Type===
COBOL is a full procedural language.

===Execution Entry Point===

A COBOL program is split into four '''divisions''', all four divisions must be present in every program in this sequence: Identification; Environment; Data and Procedure. Each division contains a number of mandatory and optional '''sections''' and '''paragraphs'''.

The '''Identification Division''' contains information about the program, including its name, author, date of compilation, etc. It must contain the &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM-ID&lt;/code&gt; paragraph which uniquely names the program. All other paragraphs are optional.

The '''Environment Division''' describes the environment in which the program will execute. For example, it includes details of input and output files and the target execution platform. The division contains two sections: the '''Configuration Section''' and the '''Input-Output section'''. 

The '''Data Division''' contains the '''File Section''', which fully describes the record layout of each input and output file, and the '''Working-Storage Section''' where variables are declared. It also contains the '''Linkage Section''' which describes data that will be passed between programs that call each other.

The '''Procedure Division''' contains the executable program instructions. The execution entry point is the first statement in the division.

===General Syntax===
It would be very difficult to give an overview of COBOL's general syntax, since the language has over 500 reserved words.  Moreover, the syntax (like other early languages, including FORTRAN) is not designed to follow a formal grammar; for this reason COBOL and FORTRAN parsers are rarely implemented using automatic code generators.

Here are some sample assignment statements:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 MOVE A TO B.
 COMPUTE GROSS-PAY = HOURS-WORKED * HOURLY-RATE
 MULTIPLY HOURLY-RATE BY HOURS-WORKED GIVING GROSS-PAY
 SET MY-INDEX TO 1

 SET ADDRESS OF MY-LINKAGE-SECTION-ITEM TO MY-POINTER
 READ TRANSACTION-FILE INTO TRANSACTION-RECORD-WS
&lt;/source&gt;

While many sites still use all uppercase characters, modern COBOL compilers are case-insensitive.  The following two statements are absolutely equivalent:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 MOVE MY-NUMBER TO YOUR-NUMBER.
 Move my-number to Your-Number.
&lt;/source&gt;

Character case is respected for quoted literals (character strings).

===Comments===
Normally the only way to specify a comment is by putting an asterisk in the indicator-area (column 7).  The entire line is a comment.  Block comments must have * in column 7 of every line.  There is a 2002 standard that allows part of a line to be a comment:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 MOVE A TO B.   *&gt; THIS IS A COMMENT ON THE SAME LINE AS A STATEMENT
&lt;/source&gt;

===Variable Declarations===
There are a few variables of a type known as special registers that do not need to be defined, but generally all variables must be defined in COBOL, unlike interpreted BASIC.

COBOL has a number of data types, but the most common are numeric (with specifiers for internal format), numeric edited data, alphanumeric data, and records (similar to structs in C):
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 01  TRANSACTION-RECORD.
    05  RECORD-NUMBER            PICTURE S9(7) COMP-3 VALUE ZERO.
    05  RECORD-DESCRIPTION       PICTURE X(30) VALUE SPACES.
    05  EDITED-AMOUNT            PIC $$$$,$$$,$$$.99-.
    05  FILLER                   PIC X(60) VALUE SPACES.
&lt;/source&gt;

Your simple example, declaring an integer, might look something like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 77  I    pic s9(4)  usage is binary.
&lt;/source&gt;

COBOL also supports redefinition, which is somewhat similar to union in C.

==Method Declaration/Implementation==
Object-oriented extensions are available to COBOL, but the vast majority of COBOL programmers don't know them, and see no need for them.

However if a COBOL programer wants to create a class it is quite easy.  For example here is an HelloWorld class with an InstanceMethod!
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
       class-id. HelloWorld as &quot;HelloWorld&quot;.
       environment division.
       configuration section.
       repository.
      
       object.
       data division.
       working-storage section.

       method-id. &quot;InstanceMethod&quot;.
       local-storage section.
       linkage section.
       procedure division.
           display &quot;Hello World&quot;
           exit method.           
       end method &quot;InstanceMethod&quot;.
      
       end object.
       end class HelloWorld
&lt;/source&gt;

If the COBOL programmer wants to interact with external classes such as the .NET Framework it can do too. For example here is a example of obtaining the current date/time from .NET.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
        repository.
           class sys-datetime as &quot;System.DateTime&quot;
           .
        01 now sys-datetime.
        procedure division.
           set now to sys-datetime::&quot;Now&quot;
           display now
&lt;/source&gt;

===Scope===
All data contained working-storage section of the COBOL program is global.  Some data items may be defined as external, and visible to other programs in a load module. The data items in a COBOL subprogram are global to the subprogram, but local since the caller cannot see them.  Typically, data is &quot;passed&quot; from a COBOL main program to a subprogram by reference.  There are alternatives of &quot;by content&quot; or &quot;by value&quot;, but they are typically only used to call subprograms written in C or other languages that do not normally use call by reference.

Some vendors provide extensions, such as thread-local-storage section and local-storage section.   These extensions allow data to scoped as either thread-local or temporary to the program.

===Conditional Statements===
There are a lot of them.  Here are some examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 If my-number is numeric
    continue
 else
    display 'data field &quot;my-number&quot; is not numeric'
 end-if

 evaluate record-type
 when 'a'
    perform process-record-type-a
 when 'b'
    perform process-record-type-b
 when 'c'
    continue
 when 'd'
 when 'e'
    perform process-record-type-d-or-e
 when other
    perform process-invalid-record-type
 end-evaluate

 READ TRANSACTION-FILE INTO MY-TRAN-REC-WS
 AT END
    SET ALL-RECORDS-PROCESSED TO TRUE
 NOT AT END
    ADD +1 TO TRAN-REC-COUNT
    PERFORM PROCESS-1-TRANSACTION
 END-READ
&lt;/source&gt;
===Looping Statements===
There are several of those too:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 Perform 6 times
    add +1 to loop-count
 end-perform

 Perform process-1-billing-record
    until all-records-processed

 Perform clear-1-table-entry
    varying tbl-index from +1 by +1
    until tbl-index is greater than max-table-entries

 Search table-entry varying tbl-index
 at end
    set entry-not-found to true
 when table-key equal customer-id
    move tbl-customer-name to print-customer-name
 end-search
&lt;/source&gt;

===Output Statements===
Here are several examples.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 DISPLAY &quot;Hello, World!&quot; 
 display 'hello, world!' with no advancing

 Write billing-record from transaction-record-ws
&lt;/source&gt;

For key-sequenced files, there is support for &lt;code&gt;START&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;REWRITE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt;.

===Containers===
Not applicable to COBOL.

===Algorithms===
Recursion is not generally supported, although it can be simulated by iteration.

===Garbage collection===
Memory allocated dynamically via system APIs such as malloc should be free'ed with the appriopiate call to &quot;free&quot;.

COBOL programs that uses CLASS'es may need to invoke the &quot;finalize&quot; method to release the object.
For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 invoke myObject &quot;finalize&quot; returning myObject 
&lt;/source&gt;

If the COBOL application is executing under a VM such as a Java VMs or Microsoft's CLR standard garbage collection rules apply.

Otherwise..

COBOL programmers do not normally know or care what garbage collection is.  They rarely have to allocate memory or clean it up afterwards.

===Physical Structure===
A COBOL source file may have (but need not have) copybooks, somewhat similar to .h files in C.  The compiled program generally makes use of a COBOL runtime library of service routines that are dynamically loaded.  The COBOL source file itself consists of four divisions:  &lt;code&gt;IDENTIFICATION DIVISION&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ENVIRONMENT DIVISION&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DATA DIVISION&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE DIVISION&lt;/code&gt;.

===Tips===
&lt;Please include tips that make it easier to switch to this language from another language.&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Willingness is an active form of acceptance. It is accepting the need for action and taking that action. It is not necessarily going along with whatever the therapist or skills trainer thinks is best. Willingness does not demand that reality be something other than what it is. On the other hand willingness does not give up and refuse to take action that could change reality for the better in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dominance training is a controversial method of training dogs. While it has many proponents, it is often considered outdated and potentially harmful by many dog behaviorists and trainers. It is a theory that believes that the key to a well behaved dog is to be in charge of them, and not the other way around.  The practice tries to emulate the way another dog would do it, mostly through body language -- not speech as most people use.  Dogs rarely bark at each other to show dominance, they bark when excited, afraid, or angry.  But the way we control dogs is primarily by &quot;barking&quot; orders to them using complex language, which they don't understand as readily and therefore don't accept our dominance as readily. Those who practice dominance training think using mostly body language is a much more direct and native language for dogs to understand. 

Dominance training theory holds that dominance training should be done on all dogs, regardless of their breed because it can be used to treat all kinds of behavior problems. Those who oppose dominance training theory hold that dominance tactics are often harmful, that dominance tactics can make an aggressive dog more aggressive and a fearful dog more fearful, and that other techniques have been shown to be more effective for basic training in any dog, for correcting bad behavior in any dog, and for rehabilitating problem dogs.

The following is a list of methods or desired behaviors embraced by dominance theory proponents, some of which are considered effective and some of which are considered harmful under other theories of dog behavior and training:

* have them allow you to take food or toys away from them; you give them back, but they should accept your taking them and not growl

* you should walk through doors first

* you should always eat before your dog; let them smell that you are eating, but do not share (do not tease either of course)

* you can nuzzle your dog's nose, head, neck, body, in almost grooming motions, much like a parent dog would do to their puppy to clean them

* you can kiss your dog all over

* petting your dog on the top of their head (they generally don't like that)

* playing with and gently pulling your dogs ears

* playing with their feet

* when your dog is standing or sitting, put your hand over your dog's paw so you are standing on it (but not putting pressure on it of course, just the act of covering it)

* when your dog is standing on all fours, stand behind your dog with your hands on their hips, and your legs against the back of their legs; when they accept that, then add a repeating knee bend, vaguely simulating the motion that another dog who mounted this dog would be doing

* gently bite your dog's neck, arms, and legs

* nibble on your dogs fur as if a parent dog picking out bugs or ticks; watch your dog nibble on their own fur to observe the motion

* open your mouth wide and put it over the top of your dog's lengthwise (not front on) nose (again, just like another dog would)

* when your dog is standing, stand to the side of your dog, kneel down, and grab the bottom of the further two legs away from you and pull them towards you; the dog will gently tip over and be forced to lay down in a submissive position; continue to hold the front and back legs that you grabbed; make sure it is a soft surface like grass or carpet so the dog does not get hurt when falling, and perform gently

* put your dog belly up and sit on them straddled; their back legs should be behind you, not under or in front of you, and you should not allow them to kick you

* when straddling your dog, expose their neck fully.  to do this, tip the bottom of their mouth up so that their forehead is pressing against the floor and their entire neck is exposed and stretched out and available to you, facing up; they should hold that position

* growl at your dog, especially if they approach you while you are eating or beg (dominant dogs will not let other dogs get too close to them when they are eating)

* use a gentle leader leash, which simulates another dog putting their mouth over your dog's mouth

* put your hand(s) over the top of your dog's mouth like a muzzle

[[w:HDV|WikiPedia article on HDV]]

==HDV vs DVCproHD==
DVCproHD will probably produce better results than HDV.  DVCproHD uses a chroma subsampling of 4:2:2 (i.e. it records a full-resolution lumanance image and a half-resolution colour image) whilst HDV uses 4:2:0.

DVCproHD also uses a much higher bitrate (100Mbps) than HDV (25Mbps).  But that doesn't mean that DVCproHD will be 4 times &quot;better&quot; than HDV.  HDV is a more efficient codec than DVCproHD.  And, if you're shooting at 24fps then you actually throw away a lot of DVCproHD's data.

There's an intersting discussion of HDV in comparison to other HD formats on episode 2 of the recent Creative Cow podcasts:

== Analysis Methods ==

When circuits get large and complicated, it is useful to have various methods for simplifying and analyzing the circuit. There is no perfect formula for solving a circuit. Depending on the type of circuit, there are different methods that can be employed to solve the circuit. Some methods might not work, and some methods may be very difficult in terms of long math problems. Two of the most important methods for solving circuits are '''Nodal Analysis''', and '''Mesh Current Analysis'''. These will be explained below.

== Superposition ==

One of the most important principals in the field of circuit analysis is the principal of '''superposition'''. It is valid only in linear circuits. 

{{TextBox|''The '''superposition principle''' states that the total effect of multiple contributing sources on a linear circuit is equal to the sum of the individual effects of the sources, taken one at a time.''}}

What does this mean? In plain English, it means that if we have a circuit with multiple sources, we can &quot;turn off&quot; all but one source at a time, and then investigate the circuit with only one source active at a time. We do this with every source, in turn, and then add together the effects of each source to get the total effect. Before we put this principle to use, we must be aware of the underlying mathematics. 

=== Necessary Conditions ===

Superposition can only be applied to '''linear''' circuits; that is, all of a circuit's sources hold a linear relationship with the circuit's responses. Using only a few algebraic rules, we can build a mathematical understanding of superposition.  If ''f'' is taken to be the response, and ''a'' and ''b'' are constant, then:

:&lt;math&gt;f(ax_1+bx_2)= f(ax_1) + f(bx_2) \,&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of a circuit, it clearly explains the concept of superposition; each input can be considered individually and then summed to obtain the output. With just a few more algebraic properties, we can see that superposition cannot be applied to non-linear circuits.  In this example, the response ''y'' is equal to the square of the input x, i.e. y=x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. If ''a'' and ''b'' are constant, then:

:&lt;math&gt;y=(ax_1+bx_2)^2 \ne (ax_1)^2 + (bx_2)^2 = y_1+y_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is only one of an infinite number of counter-examples...

=== Step by Step ===

Using superposition to find a given output can be broken down into four steps:

#Isolate a source - Select a source, and set all of the remaining sources to zero.  The consequences of &quot;turning off&quot; these sources are explained in [[Circuit_Theory/Circuit_Basics#Open_and_Closed_Circuits|Open and Closed Circuits]].  In summary, turning off a voltage source results in a short circuit, and turning off a current source results in an open circuit. (Reasoning - no current can flow through a open circuit and there can be no voltage drop across a short circuit.)  
#Find the output from the isolated source - Once a source has been isolated, the response from the source in question can be found using any of the techniques we've learned thus far.  
#Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each source - Continue to choose a source, set the remaining sources to zero, and find the response.  Repeat this procedure until every source has been accounted for.
#Sum the Outputs - Once the output due to each source has been found, add them together to find the total response.

== Impulse Response ==

An '''impulse response''' of a circuit can be used to determine the output of the circuit:

[[Image:System Block.svg|400px|center]]

The output y is the '''convolution''' h * x of the input x and the impulse response:

{{eqn|Convolution}}
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = (h*x)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} h(t-s)x(s)ds&lt;/math&gt;.

If the input, x(t), was an '''impulse''' (&lt;math&gt;\delta(t)&lt;/math&gt;), the output y(t) would be equal to h(t).

By knowing the impulse response of a circuit, any source can be plugged-in to the circuit, and the output can be calculated by convolution.

== Convolution ==

The '''convolution operation''' is a very difficult, involved operation that combines two equations into a single resulting equation. Convolution is defined in terms of a definite integral, and as such, solving convolution equations will require knowledge of integral calculus. This wikibook will not require a prior knowledge of integral calculus, and therefore will not go into more depth on this subject then a simple definition, and some light explanation.

=== Definition ===

The convolution a * b of two functions a and b is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;(a * b)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty a(\tau)b(t - \tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

{{SideBox|Remember: &lt;br&gt;Asterisks mean '''convolution''', not '''multiplication'''}}

The asterisk operator is used to denote convolution. Many computer systems, and people who frequently write mathematics on a computer will often use an asterisk to denote simple multiplication (the asterisk is the multiplication operator in many programming languages), however an important distinction must be made here: '''The asterisk operator means convolution.'''

=== Properties ===

Convolution is commutative, in the sense that &lt;math&gt;a * b = b * a&lt;/math&gt;. Convolution is also ''distributive'' over addition, i.e. &lt;math&gt;a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c&lt;/math&gt;, and ''associative'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Systems, and convolution ===

Let us say that we have the following block-diagram system:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|[[Image:System Block.svg|400px|center]]
|
*''x(t)'' = '''system input'''
*''h(t)'' = '''impulse response'''
*''y(t)'' = ''' system output'''
|}

Where x(t) is the input to the circuit, h(t) is the circuit's impulse response, and y(t) is the output. Here, we can find the output by convoluting the impulse response with the input to the circuit. Hence we see that the impulse response of a circuit is not just the ratio of the output over the input. In the frequency domain however, component in the output with frequency &amp;omega; is the product of the input component with the same frequency and the transition function at that frequency. The moral of the story is this: ''the output to a circuit is the input convolved with the impulse response.''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Circuit Theory/Page}}

== Basic Terminology ==

There are a few key terms that need to be understood at the beginning of this book, before we can continue. This is only a partial list of all terms that will be used throughout this book, but these key words are important to know before we begin the main narrative of this text. 

;Time domain : The time domain is described by graphs of power, voltage and current that depend upon time. The &quot;Time domain&quot; is simply another way of saying that our circuits change with time, and that the major variable used to describe the system is time. Another name is &quot;Temporal&quot;.

;Frequency domain: The frequency domain are graphs of power, voltage and/or current that depend upon frequency such as [[:w:Bode_plot|Bode plots]]. Variable frequencies in wireless communication can represent changing channels or data on a channel. Another name is the &quot;[[:w:Fourier_transform|Fourier domain]]&quot;. Other domains that an engineer might encounter are the &quot;Laplace domain&quot; (or the &quot;s domain&quot; or &quot;complex frequency domain&quot;), and the &quot;Z domain&quot;. When combined with the time, it is called a &quot;Spectral&quot; or &quot;[[w:Spectrogram|Waterfall]].&quot;

;Circuit Response : Circuits generally have inputs and outputs. In fact, it is safe to say that a circuit isn't useful if it doesn't have one or the other (usually both). Circuit response is the relationship between the circuit's input to the circuit's output. The circuit response may be a measure of either current or voltage.

;Non-homogeneous : Circuits are described by equations that capture the the component characteristics and how they are wired together. These equations are non-homogeneous in nature. Solving these equations requires splitting the single problem into two problems: Steady State Solution (particular solution) and Transient Solution (homogeneous solution). 

;Steady State Solution : The final value, when all circuit elements have a constant or periodic behaviour, is also known as the steady-state value of the circuit. The circuit response at steady state (when voltages and currents have stopped changing due to a disturbance) is also known as the &quot;steady state response&quot;. The steady state solution to the particular integral is called the [[Ordinary_Differential_Equations/Non_Homogenous_1|'''particular solution''']]. 

;Transient Response : A transient response occurs when: 
::a circuit is turned on or off
::a sensor responds to the physical world changes
::static electricity is discharged
::an old car with old spark plugs (before resistors were put in spark plugs) drives by

:Transient means momentary, or a short period of time. Transient means that the energy in a circuit suddenly changes which causes the energy storage elements to react. The circuit's energy state is forced to change. When a car goes over a bump, it can fly apart, feel like a rock, or cushion the impact in a designed manner. The goal of most circuit design is to plan for transients, whether intended or not.

:Transient solutions are determined by assuming the driving function(s) is zero which creates a homogeneous equation, which has a [[Ordinary_Differential_Equations/Homogenous_1|'''homogeneous solution''']] technique.

== Summary ==
When something changes in a circuit, there is a certain transition period before a circuit &quot;settles down&quot;, and reaches its final value. The response that a circuit has before settling into its ''steady-state response'' is known as the ''transient response''. Using using [[:w:Euler%27s_formula|'''Euler's formula''']], [[Arithmetic_Course/Types_of_Number/Complex_Number|'''complex numbers''']], [[:w:Phasors|'''phasors''']] and the [[:w:S-plane|'''s-plane''']], a [[Ordinary_Differential_Equations/Homogenous_1|'''homogeneous solution''']] technique will be developed that captures the transient response by assuming the final state has no energy. In addition, a [[Ordinary_Differential_Equations/Non_Homogenous_1|'''particular solution''']] technique will be developed that finds the final energy state. Added together, they predict the ''circuit response''.

The related [[Ordinary_Differential_Equations|'''Differential equation''']] development of homogeneous and particular solutions will be avoided.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I feel like the current incarnation of this page gets a little bit off topic. I don't think there is any sense confusing the subject when we can simply distill out all the information that isn't immediately important. Why do we need to blur the line between different types of sources, or even differentiate between different sources, when the only thing we need to mention is what each little symbol does on a circuit diagram. I'll leave this the way it is for now, but i think we will probably need to fix this later. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 13:53, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Special files */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Unix world: one file after another==
When you think of a computer and everything that goes with it, you usually come up with a mental list of all sorts of different things:

* The computer itself
* The monitor
* The keyboard
* The mouse
* Your hard drive with your files and directories on it
* The network connection leading to the Internet
* The printer
* The DVD player
* et cetera

Here's a surprise for you: Unix doesn't have any of these things. Well, almost. Unix certainly has ''files''. Unix has endless reams of files. And since Unix has files, it also has a concept of &quot;between files&quot; (think of it this way: if your universe consists only of boxes, you automatically know about spaces where there are no boxes as well). But Unix knows nothing else than that. Everything in the whole (Unix) universe is a file.

Everything is a file. Even things that are really weird things to think of as files, are files. Your (data) files are files. Your directories are files. Your hard drive is a file. Your ''keyboard'', ''monitor'' and ''printer'' are files. Yes, really: your keyboard is a read-only file of infinite size. Your monitor and printer are infinitely sized write-only files. Your network connection is a read/write file.

At this point you're probably asking: ''Why?'' Why would the designers of the Unix system have come up with this madness? Why is everything a file? The answer is: because if everything is a file, you can '''treat''' everything like a file. Or, put a different way, you can treat everything in the Unix world the same way. And, as we will see shortly, that means you can also ''combine'' virtually everything using file operations.

Before we move on, here's an extra level of weirdness for you: everything in Unix is a file. Including the ''processes'' that run programs. Effectively this means that running programs are also files. Including the interactive shell session that you've been running to practice scripting in. Yes, really, that text screen with the blinking cursor is also a file. And we can prove it too. You might recall that in the chapter on [[Bourne_Shell_Scripting/Running_Commands#A_useful_tidbit|Running Commands]] we mentioned you can exit the shell using the Ctrl+d key combination. Because that combination produces the Unix character for... that's right, end-of-file!

==Streams: what goes between files==
As we mentioned in the previous section, everything in Unix is a file -- except that which sits ''between'' files. Between files Unix defines a mechanism that allows data to move, bit by bit, from one file to another: the '''stream'''. A stream is literally what it sounds like: a little river of bits pouring from one file into another. Although actually a bridge would probably have been a better name because unlike a stream (which is a constant flow of water) the flow of bits between files need not be constant, or even used at all.

===The standard streams===
Within the Unix world it is a general convention that each file is connected to at least three streams (that's because that turned out to be the most useful number for those files that are processes, or running programs). There can be more and in fact each file can cause itself to be connected to any number of streams (a program can print and open a network connection, for instance). But there are three basic streams available to all files, even though they may not always be useful or used. These streams are called the &quot;standard&quot; streams:

;Standard in (stdin):the standard stream for input into a file.
;Standard out (stdout):the standard stream for output out of a file.
;Standard error (stderr):the standard stream for error output from a file.

As you can probably tell, these streams are very geared towards those files that are actually processes of the system. In fact many programming languages (like C, C++, Java and Pascal) use exactly these conventions for their standard I/O operations. And since the Unix operating system family includes them in the core of the system definition, these streams are also central to the Bourne Shell.

===Getting hold of the standard streams in your scripts===
So now we know that there's a general mechanism for basic input and output in Unix; but how do you get hold of these streams in a script? What do you have to do to hook your script up to the standard out, or read from the standard in? Well, the happy answer is: nothing. Your scripts are automatically connected to the standard in, out and error stream of the process that is running them. When you read input, it automatically comes from the standard in. Your output goes straight to the standard out. And program errors go right to the standard error. In fact you've already used these streams: every example so far that has printed anything has done so to the standard output stream of your script.

And what about the shell in interactive mode? Does that use those standard streams as well? Yes, it does. In interactive mode, the standard in stream is connected to the keyboard file. And the standard output and standard error are connected to the monitor file.

===Okay... But what good is it?===
This discussion on files and streams has been very interesting so far and a nice insight into the depths of Unix. But what good does it do you to know all this? Ah, glad you asked!

The Bourne Shell has some built-in features that allow you to do neat tricks involving files and their streams. You see, files don't just have streams -- you can also cross-connect the streams of two files. At the end of the previous section we said that the standard input of the interactive session is connected to the keyboard file. In fact it is connected to the ''standard output'' stream of the keyboard file. And the standard output and error of the interactive session are connected to the ''standard input'' of the monitor file. So you can connect the streams of the interactive session to the streams of devices.

But wait. Do you remember the remark above that the point of Unix considering everything to be a file was that everything gets treated like a file? This is why that was important: you can connect a stream from ''any'' file to a stream of ''any'' other file. You can connect your interactive shell session to the printer or the network rather than to the monitor (or in addition to the monitor) using streams. You can run a program and have its output go directly to the printer by reconnecting the standard output stream of the program. You can connect the standard output stream of one program directly to the standard input stream of '''another program''' and make chains of programs. And the Bourne Shell makes it really simple to do all that.

Do you suddenly feel like you've stuck your fingers in the electrical socket? That's the feeling of the raw power of the shell flowing through your body....

== Redirecting: using streams in the shell ==

As explained in the previous section, the shell process is connected by standard streams to (by default) the keyboard and the monitor. But very often you will want to change this linking. Connecting a file to a stream is a very common operation, so would expect it to be called something like &quot;connecting&quot; or &quot;linking&quot;. But since the Bourne Shell has default connections and everything you do is always a ''change'' in the default connections, connecting a file to a (different) stream using the shell is actually called '''redirecting'''.

There are several operators built in to the Bourne Shell that relate to redirecting. The most basic and general one is the pipe operator, which we will examine in some detail further on. The others are related to redirecting to file.

===Redirecting to file===
As we explained (or rather: hinted at) in the previous section, one of the enormously powerful features of the Bourne Shell on top of a Unix operating system is the ability to chain programs together. Execute a program, have it produce output, then automatically send that output to another program as input. The possible combinations are endless, as is the power of what you can achieve.

One of the most common places where you might want to send a program's output is to a file in the file system. And this time by file we mean a regular, classic data file and not a Unix &quot;everything is a file including your hardware&quot; file. In order to achieve this you can imagine that we can use the chaining mechanism described above: let a program generate output through the standard output stream, then connect that stream  (i.e. ''redirect the output'') to the standard input stream of a program that creates a data file in the file system. And this would absolutely work. However, redirecting to a data file is such a common operation that you don't need a separate end-of-chain program for it. Redirecting to file is built straight into the Bourne Shell, through the following operators:

;''process'' &gt; ''data file'':redirect the output of ''process'' to the data file; create the file if necessary, overwrite its existing contents otherwise.
;''process'' &gt;&gt; ''data file'':redirect the output of ''process'' to the data file; create the file if necessary, append to its existing contents otherwise.
;''process'' &lt; ''data file'':read the contents of the data file and redirect that contents to ''process'' as input.


====Redirecting output====
Let's take a closer look at these operators through some examples. Take the simple Bourne shell script below called 'hello.sh':

{{code:Basic
|A simple shell script that generates some output
|&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
#!/bin/sh
echo Hello
&lt;/source&gt;}}

This code may be run in any of the ways described in the chapter [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Running Commands|Running Commands]]. When we run the script, it simply outputs the string &quot;Hello&quot; to the screen and then returns us to our prompt. But let's say we want to redirect the output to a file instead. We can use the redirect operators to do that easily:

{{code:Basic
|Redirecting the output to a data file
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ hello.sh &gt; myfile.txt
$&lt;/source&gt;}}

This time, we don't see the string 'Hello' on the screen. Where's it gone? Well, exactly where we wanted it to: into the (new) data file called 'myfile.txt'. Let's examine this file  using the 'cat' command:

{{code:Basic|Examining the results of redirecting some output
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ cat myfile.txt
Hello
$&lt;/source&gt;}}

Let's run the program again, this time using the '&gt;&gt;' operator instead, and then examine 'myfile.txt' again using the 'cat' command:

{{code:Basic|Redirecting using the append redirect
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ hello.sh &gt;&gt; myfile.txt
$ cat myfile.txt
Hello
Hello
$&lt;/source&gt;}}

You can see that 'myfile.txt' now consists of two lines &amp;mdash; the output has been added to the end of the file (or concatenated); this is due to the use of the '&gt;&gt;' operator. If we run the script again, this time with the single greater-than operator, we get:

{{code:Basic|Redirecting using the overwrite redirect
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ hello.sh &gt; myfile.txt
$ cat myfile.txt
Hello
$&lt;/source&gt;}}

Just one 'Hello' again, because the '&gt;' will always overwrite the contents of an existing file if there is one.

====Redirecting input====
Okay, so it's clear we can redirect output to a data file. But what about reading from a data file? That's also pretty common. The Bourne Shell helps us here as well: the entire process of reading a file and pumping its data into a stream is captured by the '&lt;' operator.

By default 'stdin' is fed from your keyboard; run the 'cat' command without any arguments and it will just sit there, waiting for you type something:
{{code:Basic|cat ???
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ cat&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I can type all day here, and I never seem to get my prompt back from&lt;br/&gt;
this stupid machine.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I have even pressed RETURN a few times !!!&lt;br/&gt;
.....etc....etc&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;}}

In fact 'cat' will sit there all day until you type a 'Ctrl+D' (the 'End of File Character' or 'EOF' for short). To redirect our standard input from somewhere else use the '&lt;' (less-than operator):

{{code:Basic|Redirecting into the standard input
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ cat &lt; myfile.txt
Hello
$
&lt;/source&gt;}}

So 'cat' will now read from the text file 'myfile.txt'; the 'EOF' character is also generated at the end of file, so 'cat' will exit as before.

Note that we previously used 'cat' in this format:

{{bcode:Example|$ cat myfile.txt}}

Which is functionally identical to 

{{bcode:Example|$ cat &lt; myfile.txt}}

However, these are two fundamentally different mechanisms: one uses an argument to the command, the other is more general and redirects 'stdin' &amp;ndash; which is what we're concerned with here. It's more convenient to use 'cat' with a filename as argument, which is why the inventors of 'cat' put this in. However, not all programs and scripts are going to take arguments so this is just an easy example.

====Combining file redirects====

It's possible to redirect 'stdin' and 'stdout' in one line:

{{code:Basic|Redirecting input to and output from cat at the same time|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ cat &lt; myfile.txt &gt; mynewfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;}}

The command above will copy the contents of 'myfile.txt' to 'mynewfile.txt' (and will overwrite any previous contents of 'mynewfile.txt'). Once again this is just a convenient example as we normally would have achieved this effect using 'cp myfile.txt mynewfile.txt'.

====Redirecting standard error (and other streams)====
So far we have looked at redirecting the &quot;normal&quot; standard streams associated with files, i.e. the files that you use if everything goes correctly and as planned. But what about that other stream? The one meant for errors? How do we go about redirecting that? For example, if we wanted to redirect error data into a log file.

As an example, consider the ls command. If you run the command 'ls myfile.txt', it simply lists the filename 'myfile.txt' &amp;ndash; if that file exists. If the file 'myfile.txt' does NOT exist, 'ls' will return an error to the 'stderr' stream, which by default in Bourne Shell is also connected to your monitor.

So, lets run 'ls' a couple of times, first on a file which does exist and then on one that doesn't:

{{code:Output|Listing an existing file
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ls myfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;
|myfile.txt &lt;/br&gt;
$|}}

and then:

{{code:Output|Listing a non-existent file
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ls nosuchfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;
|ls: no such file or directory &lt;/br&gt;
$|}}

And again, this time with 'stdout' redirected only:

{{code:Output|Trying to redirect...
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ls nosuchfile.txt &gt; logfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;
|ls: no such file or directory &lt;/br&gt;
$|}}

We still see the error message; 'logfile.txt' will be created but will be empty. This is because we have now redirected the stdout stream, while the error message was written to the error stream. So how do we tell the shell that we want to redirect the error stream?

In order to understand the answer, we have to cover a little more theory about Unix files and streams. You see, deep down the reason that we can redirect stdin and stdout with simple operators is that redirecting those streams is so common that the shell lets us use a shorthand notation for those streams. But actually, to be completely correct, we should have told the shell in every case ''which'' stream we wanted to redirect. In general you see, the shell cannot know: there could be tons of streams connected to any file. And in order to distinguish one from the other each stream connected to a file has a number associated with it: by convention 0 is the standard in, 1 is the standard out, 2 is standard error and any other streams have numbers counting on from there. To redirect any particular stream you prepend the redirect operator with the stream number (called the ''file descriptor''. So to redirect the error message in our example, we prepend the redirect operator with a 2, for the stderr stream:

{{code:Output|Redirecting the stderr stream
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ls nosuchfile.txt 2&gt; logfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;|$|}}

No output to the screen, but if we examine 'logfile.txt':

{{code:Output|Checking the logfile
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ cat logfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;
|ls: no such file or directory &lt;/br&gt;$|}}

As we mentioned before, the operator without a number is a shorthand notation. In other words, this:

{{bcode:Example|$ cat &lt; inputfile.txt &gt; outputfile.txt}}

is actually short for

{{bcode:Example|$ cat 0&lt; inputfile.txt 1&gt; outputfile.txt}}

We can also redirect both 'stdout' and 'stderr' independently like this:

{{bcode:Example|$ ls nosuchfile.txt &gt; stdio.txt 2&gt;logfile.txt &lt;/br&gt;
$}}

'stdio.txt' will be blank , 'logfile.txt' will contain the error as before.

If we want to redirect stdout and stderr to the same file, we can use the file descriptor as well:

{{bcode:Example|$ ls nosuchfile.txt &gt; alloutput.txt 2&gt;&amp;1}}

Here '2&gt;&amp;1' means something like 'redirect stderr to the same file stdout has been redirected to'. Be careful with the ordering! If you do it this way:

{{bcode:Example|$ ls nosuchfile.txt 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; alloutput.txt}}

you will redirect stderr to the file that stdout points to, then send stdout somewhere else &amp;mdash; and both streams will end up being redirected to different locations.

====Special files====
We said earlier that the redirect operators discussed so far all redirect to data files. While this is technically true, Unix magic still means that there's more to it than just that. You see, the Unix file system tends to contain a number of special files called &quot;devices&quot;, by convention collected in the /dev directory. These device files include the files that represent your hard drive, DVD player, USB stick and so on. They also include some special files, like /dev/null (also known as the bit bucket; anything you write to this file is discarded). You can redirect to device files as well as to regular data files. Be careful here; you really don't want to redirect raw text data to the boot sector of your hard drive (and you can!). But if you know what you're doing, you can use the device files by redirecting to them (this is how DVDs are burned in Linux, for instance).
 
As an example of how you might actually use a device file, in the 'Solaris' flavour of Unix the loudspeaker and its microphone can be accessed by the file '/dev/audio'. So:

{{bcode:Example|&amp;#x23; cat /tmp/audio.au &gt; /dev/audio}}
Will play a sound, whereas:

{{bcode:Example|&amp;#x23; cat &lt; /dev/audio &gt; /tmp/mysound.au}}

Will record a sound.(you will need to CTRL-C this to finish...)

This is fun:

{{bcode:Example|&amp;#x23; cat &lt; /dev/audio &gt; /dev/audio}}

Now wave the microphone around whilst shouting - Jimi Hendrix style feedback. Great stuff.
You will probably need to be logged in as 'root' to try this by the way.

====Some redirect warnings====
The astute reader will have noticed one or two things in the discussion above. First of all, a file can have more than just the standard streams associated with it. Is it legal to redirect those? Is it even ''possible''? The answer is, technically, yes. You can redirect stream 4 or 5 of a file (if they exist). Don't try it though. If there's more than a few streams in any direction, you won't know which stream you're redirecting. Plus, if a program needs more than the standard streams it's a good bet that program also needs its extra streams going to a specific location.

Second, you might have noticed that file descriptor 0 is, by convention, the standard input stream. Does that mean you can redirect a program's standard input '''away''' from the program? Could you do the following?

{{bcode:Example|$ cat 0&gt; somewhere_else}}

The answer is, yes you can. And yes, things will break if you do.

=== Pipes, Tees and Named Pipes ===
So, after all this talk about redirecting to file, we finally get to it: general redirecting by cross-connecting streams. The most general form of redirecting and the most powerful one to boot. It's called a pipe and is performed using the pipe operator '|'. Pipes allow you to join two processes together through a &quot;pipeline&quot;, which directly connects the stdout of one file to the stdin of another.

As an example let's consider the 'grep' command which returns a matching string, given a keyword and some text to search. And let's also use the ps command, which lists running processes on the machine. If you give the command 

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -eaf}}

it will generally list pagefuls of running processes on your machine, which you would have to sift through manually to find what you want. Let's say you are looking for a process which you know contains the word 'oracle'; use the output of 'ps' to pipe into grep, which will only return the matching lines:

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -eaf {{!}} grep oracle}}

Now you will only get back the lines you need. What happens if there's still loads of these ? No problem, pipe the output to the command 'more' (or 'pg'), which will pause your screen if it fills up:

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -ef {{!}} grep oracle {{!}} more}}

What about if you want to kill all those processes? You need the 'kill' program, plus the process number for each process (the second column returned by the ps command). Easy:

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -ef {{!}} grep oracle {{!}} awk '{print $2}' {{!}} xargs kill -9}}

In this command, 'ps' lists the processes and 'grep' narrows the results down to oracle. The 'awk' tool pulls out the second column of each line. And 'xargs' feeds each line, one at a time, to 'kill' as a command line argument.

Pipes can be used to link as many programs as you wish within reasonable limits (and we don't know what these limits are!)

Don't forget you can still use the redirectors in combination:

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -ef {{!}} grep oracle &gt; /tmp/myprocesses.txt}}

There is another useful mechanism that can be used with pipes: the 'tee'. To understand tee, imagine a pipe shaped like a 'T' - one input, two outputs:

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -ef {{!}} grep oracle {{!}} tee /tmp/myprocesses.txt}}

The 'tee' will copy whatever is given to its stdin and redirect this to the argument given (a file); it will also then send a further copy to its stdout - which means you can effectively intercept
the pipe, take a copy at this stage, and carry on piping up other commands; useful maybe for outputting to a logfile, and copying to the screen.

A note on piped commands: piped processes run in parallel on the Unix environment. Sometimes one process will be blocked, waiting for input from another process. But each process in a pipeline is, in principle, running simultaneously with all the others.

====Named pipes====
There is a variation on the in-line pipe which we have been discussing called the 'named pipe'. A named pipe is actually a file with its own 'stdin' and 'stdout' - which you attach processes to. This is useful for allowing programs to talk to each other, especially when you don't know exactly when one program will try and talk to the other (waiting for a backup to finish etc.) and when you don't want to write a complicated network-based listener or do a clumsy polling loop.

To create a 'named pipe', you use the 'mkfifo' command (fifo=first in, first out; so data is read out in the same order as it is written into).

{{bcode:Example|$ mkfifo mypipe &lt;br/&gt;$}}

This creates a named pipe called 'mypipe'; next we can start using it.

This test is best run with two terminals logged in:

1. From 'terminal a'

{{bcode:Example|$ cat &lt; mypipe}}

The 'cat' will sit there waiting for an input.

2. From 'terminal b'

{{bcode:Example|$ cat myfile.txt &gt; mypipe &lt;br/&gt; $}}

This should finish immediately. Flick back to 'terminal a'; this will now have read from the pipe and received an 'EOF', and you will see the data on the screen; the command will have finished, and you are back at the command prompt.

Now try the other way round:

1. From terminal 'b'

{{bcode:Example|$ cat myfile.txt &gt; mypipe}}

This will now sit there, as there isn't another process on the other end to 'drain' the pipe - it's blocked.

2. From terminal 'a'

{{bcode:Example|$ cat &lt; mypipe}}

As before, both processes will now finish, the output showing on terminal 'a'.

==Here documents==
So far we have looked at redirecting from and to data files and cross-connecting data streams. All of these shell mechanisms are based on having a &quot;physical&quot; source for data &amp;mdash; a process or a data file. Sometimes though, you want to feed some data into a target without having a source for it. In these cases you can use an &quot;on the fly&quot; document called a ''here document''. A here document means that you open a virtual text document (in memory), type into it as usual, close it and then treat it like any normal file.

Creating a here document is done using a variation on the input redirect operator: the '&lt;&lt;' operator. Like the input redirect operator, the here document operator takes an argument. For the input redirect operator this operand is the name of the file to be streamed in. For the here document operator it is the string that will terminate the here document. So using the here document operator looks like this:

{{bcode:Example|''target'' '''&lt;&lt;''' ''terminator string''&lt;br/&gt;
''here document contents''&lt;br/&gt;
''terminator string''&lt;br/&gt;}}

For example: 

{{code:Output|Using a here document|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat &lt;&lt; %%
&gt; This is a test.
&gt; This test uses a here document.
&gt; Hello world.
&gt; This here document will end upon the occurrence of the string &quot;%%&quot; on a separate line.
&gt; So this document is still open now.
&gt; But now it will end....
&gt; %%&lt;/source&gt;
|This is a test.&lt;br/&gt;This test uses a here document.&lt;br/&gt;Hello world.&lt;br/&gt;This here document will end upon the occurrence of the string &quot;%%&quot; on a separate line.&lt;br/&gt;So this document is still open now.&lt;br/&gt;But now it will end....|}}

When using here documents in combination with variable or command substitution, it is important to realize that substitutions are carried out ''before'' the here document is passed on. So for example:

{{code:Output|Using a here document with substitutions|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ COMMAND=cat
$ PARAM='Hello World!!'
$ $COMMAND &lt;&lt;%
&gt; `echo $PARAM`
&gt; %&lt;/source&gt;
|Hello World!!|}}

      <comment>/* Basic Principles */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Capitalize''' means to use uppercase for the first letter of a word.

==Basic Principles==

* '''Proper nouns''': Capitalize nouns that are the unique identification for a particular person, place or thing. 
*: Example: Michael, Minnesota, North America.
* '''Proper names''': Capitalize common nouns like party only when they are part of the full name for the person, place or thing. 
*: Example: I am a member of the Democratic Party. 
*: Example: Are you going to the party? 
They are also lowercased when being used in a plural setting: 
*: Example: The Democratic and Republican parties.
* '''Sentences''': Capitalize the first word of every sentence including quoted statements and direct questions. 
* '''Composition''': Capitalize the main words in the names of books, movies, plays, poems, operas, songs, radio and television programs, etc. 
*: Example: Family Guy.
* '''Titles''': Capitalize formal titles only when used in front of a name, not when used after the name. 
*: Example: Associate Professor John Doe / John Doe, associate professor.
* '''Academic titles''':  Capitalize and spell out formal titles only when they precede a name. 
*: Example:  Chancellor David Nachriener.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This handbook is intended as a reference for everything necessary for a person or group to become self-sustaining in every way possible. It will include information and links to other books which are useful in the obtaining of this goal. In each category information will be organized from less complex and sophisticated methods to ones requiring more sophistication. For example, in the section on construction of shelters the first entry explains how to construct a makeshift temporary structure out of sticks and leaves, while later entries discuss more permanent building methods including ones capable of withstanding hurricane force winds. Because this is such a broad topic, and will doubtless cover information which is available in other books, each section will contain a subsection for linking to other applicable books on the subject being addressed. This will prevent unnecessary work and redundancy.

==Table of contents==
===Housing and shelter===
     
Your primary consideration in housing type for self-reliance will be what type of building materials are available to you.  Once you have established that move on to consideration of how long you will choose to stay in that location.
     
Temporary shelters are easy and fast to construct and even with several weeks in a location are easy to maintain.  Long term shelters need more forethought and care during construction.

All shelters should be built with at least two doors so that you are not trapped inside the shelter.  Depending on your situation even more consideration to getting out of the shelter could be prudent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">	A strong ridge pole and a good location are the first steps to the debris hut. Make sure the area is high and dry to avoid any problems with water drainage during a storm. The area was checked for abundance of material and possible hazards. (i.e. poisonous plants, insects, deadfalls, widow-makers, etc.) Direction is noted for the door. Look closely; you may find my tracks in a thin layer of debris under the ridgepole.

[[Image:Debris1.jpg]]
 
Next, sticks are placed as ribbing along both sides of the ridge pole. This is done after I have laid down and measured the interior. Note the door opening near the sapling facing east or slightly southeast. 

A good alternative to starting this method that is even easier to make is just to lean sticks against a big long log, fallen tree or rock.

[[Image:Debris2.jpg]]

	Still more sticks are placed to hold the debris up. More dry debris is also stuffed in the interior for comfortable bedding that lifts you off the cold ground. This is also a good time to roof off your entryway by placing four forked sticks into the ground at the desired height, and ribbing the top with a network of sticks.

[[Image:Debris3.jpg]]
 
Start piling on debris thick and high. Note the steep walls for shedding water. 	

[[Image:Debris4.jpg]]
 
	The finished product! The walls are about 2 feet thick, good for a 20 degree night. This was probably my 10th debris hut. It took about 2 hours from start to finish. The rather speedy time (for me anyway) was no doubt due to the extraordinary abundance of material in this beautiful transition forest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well it's wash day again and you've got piles and piles of laundry that needs to be taken care of right away! But you have no electricity! Now what? 

First of all, don't despair! Great Grandmother did it, so can you! She had the tools of the trade though, and you can too with a little ingenuity...

The very first thing to do is gather all your equipment. You will need: 3 large tubs, water tight. These can be made of any material. Years ago iron pots were used for this, but I use galvanized tubs or even plastic for rinsing. Laundry Soap. Of course, lye soap was used many years ago, but if you only have regular laundry soap, so much the better! You can even use bar soap like Ivory. There are liquid laundry soaps designed for use with cold water, which reduce the need for washing in hot water.

A washing board. Yep, you really need this little contraption. Unless that is, you want to take your clothes and pound the dirt out of them with a club! Yes, some ladies actually did this to clean their clothes! Wore the fabric out pretty quickly, I'd say. Believe me, you will get very tired of rubbing your clothes on your hands, get a wash board. You might want to get a bottle of bluing for the whites, and some fabric softener. You'll need a supply of wood for a fire and a safe place to build a fire. One of your pans needs to be able to sit over a fire. You will also need a long stick with which to move clothes out of the hot water, and to stir them in the wash water. 

An alternative to the washboard is a domestic rubber sink or toilet plunger (clean of course). In the past a washing &quot;dolly&quot; was a short wooden pole with four or five wooden legs attached. These devices will easily agitate and beat clothes clean without having to rub using your hands; a lot easier for elders or those with hand problems.

Now, you're ready to start!

Build a good hot fire. Wait a little while and let it burn down a bit so that there are plenty of hot coals. Fashion a way that you can set the tub on the fire, keeping the fire underneath the tub. It is really best to have a tub with feet on it, but you can rig up a good set up using an old grill off of a BBQ or something. Even cinder blocks or large rocks can be used. While the fire is heating, you can separate your clothes, by color and by least to most dirty. 

Fill two rinse tubs with cool, clean water, away from the fire. 

Fill the wash tub about 2/3 with water. Let it heat until very hot, even boiling. You may even want to boil very dirty clothes like work pants, jeans or white socks. Add laundry soap. Remove carefully from the fire and to a table or to the ground. This normally takes two people. 

Pretreat any stains as you normally would. Add your clothes to the hot water, starting with the least dirty ones first like shirts and underwear. 

Be careful of burning your hands in the hot water! Rub the clothes on the washboard. Adding soap as needed. Rub then plunge, rub, then plunge.....remember Far and Away? 

Take the hot clothes out of the wash water with your stick, place them in the first rinse. Rinse and wring as best as you can. Place the clothes in the second rinse, adding fabric softener or bluing if desired. Don't wear yourself out wringing, just hang up the clothes, dripping, outside. If it is in winter or rainy weather, you will have to wring them as well as you can. 

Continue through the dirtiest clothes, re-using the wash water as many times as you can get away with it. Just re-heat it until you have to start over with clean water. You can use the second rinse water many, many times. The first rinse water will have to be changed frequently depending on how much soap you use. 

When I get to the point that I need to change my wash water, I try to find something I can use it for instead of throwing it out. Usually I end up washing the porch, patio or outside of the house. You could wash your deck, boat, or dog kennel, I guess. 

The key to clean clothes is plenty of elbow grease and plenty of rinsing!
Happy Washing!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
 Run &lt;tt&gt;start.bat&lt;/tt&gt; (win32) or &lt;tt&gt;start.sh&lt;/tt&gt; (Unix) to start the Application.

This starts the application in a maximised window. It is possible to start the application in fullscreen mode as would likely be required in a deployment scenario. See below for further details. 

The lower part of the screen lists all of the current valid accounts. By default, these are 
* Administrator
* Manager
* Employee
* Guest

You can log in as any of these users by selecting the relevant icon. You will not be prompted for a password since all of the default accounts are created without a password. 

 Select the Administrator login


Once logged in as administrator, there are three collapsible panels on the left side of the screen. These are

;Principal:
This is where the basic point of sale operations take place. It is possible to record sales, issue refunds, close the cash for the trading period and create reports on the cash transactions. 

;Administration:
Here you can set up the product catalog and tax categories. You can also run miscellaneous reports (I assume these will be repositioned soon) and configure the basic application level objects (users, tables, floors and other resources). 

;System:
Here you can configure the behaviour of the application infrastructure. For example, the location of the persistent store (by default, a HSQL DB in your home directory), the printer properties and whether the application operates in fullscreen or windowed mode.


== Getting Started ==

=== User Management ===

From the administration panel on the left, select &lt;tt&gt;Configuration&lt;/tt&gt; then &lt;tt&gt;Users&lt;/tt&gt;. Here you can add, remove and edit the system users. To add a new user, select the third last icon from the top toolbar and fill in the values for Name and Role. You can optionally set the password and provide an image for this user. 

You can delete the existing accounts by selecting them in the listbox and clicking the icon with the red cross. 
 WARNING: There is no confirmation for any deletion!

To save all of your changes, select the last (save) icon from the toolbar.

=== Tax Management === 
From the administration panel, select  &lt;tt&gt;Stock&lt;/tt&gt; then &lt;tt&gt;Taxes&lt;/tt&gt;. Here you can set up tax bands that will later be associated with products. This allows taxation calculations to be performed automatically.

=== Category Management ===

Managing the catalog consists of setting up categories and adding products to those categories. Note that
# Categories cannot be nested
# Products can belong to at most one category
To set up a category, go to the &lt;tt&gt;Administration&lt;/tt&gt; panel and select &lt;tt&gt;Stock&lt;/tt&gt;, then select &lt;tt&gt;Categories&lt;/tt&gt;. The form layout is similar to the user management form. Select the &lt;tt&gt;New&lt;/tt&gt; icon and fill in the values for ID and Category. Note that the category ID must be unique. If you reuse an ID you will receive the error message
 Notice: Cannot create a new record.
If you select the &lt;tt&gt;Information&lt;/tt&gt; button from the error dialog, you should see the following message
&lt;pre&gt;
net.adrianromero.data.loader.DataException: 
java.sql.SQLException: Unique constraint violation:  
in statement [insert into CATEGORIES (ID, NAME, IMAGE) values (?, ?, ?)]
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is the databases way of telling you that you have reused an ID value. 


=== Product Management === 

From the administration panel on the left, select &lt;tt&gt;Stock&lt;/tt&gt; then &lt;tt&gt;Products&lt;/tt&gt;. Here you can add, remove and edit products. To add a new product, select the third last icon from the top toolbar and fill in the values for &lt;tt&gt;Reference&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Name&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Buy Price&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Sell Price&lt;/tt&gt;. You can optionally specify values for &lt;tt&gt;Category&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Tax&lt;/tt&gt;. As with categories, the value for &lt;tt&gt;Reference&lt;/tt&gt; must be unique. If you select the &lt;tt&gt;Catalog&lt;/tt&gt; checkbox, the product will appear in to system users when they select the appropriate category.

&lt;pre&gt;Note: products cannot be added until a tax rate and a category has been created for them.&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
From the GENERAL tab, click STOCK. 

Stock Cost per Year.
Stock Volume.         The starting count for this Product.

From the STOCK tab, click PROPERTIES

Auxiliar  -           If this product is on consignment, check this field

Scale
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Typical Workflow ==
* Concept of closing cash
* Procedure for ringing up sale
* How TP interacts with
** Barcode scanner
** Cash Drawer
** Credit card reader
* Report generation
 

== Bulk Operations ==
* JDBC configuration
* DB Schema layout
* Sample bulk import procedure

-- !! How does one import a product list?

&lt;pre&gt;
There are various applications out there that provide access to MySQL data  

from  EXCEL.  One example is found at http://www.sobolsoft.com/excelmysql. 

 It is $29.00 for the full featured Excel Add-In, but it provides complete 

IMPORT and EXPORT data flows - all the features of a spreadsheet, and all the 

functionality of a database.

The free-est, cheapest method would be to key the Product data into a file (CSV 

or some other data format), and then use the MySQL loader tools. PostgreSQL has 

loader tools, too.

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Also, the vast majority of useful COBOL applications came thru the Y2K crisis just fine. ==

I don't know where to start with this statement.  I just want to shake my head and scream here!

The reason why COBOL program made it through the Y2K era intact was due to a herculean effort on the part of thousands of software developers around the world who had to re-learn (or learn for the first time) COBOL, and the Y2K problems were fixed.

That the problems didn't show up was due to the fact that these people actually did their job they got paid to do:  Fix Y2K problems.

See [[w:Y2K]] for some more details on this, but it was a very real problem.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:06, 2 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Finding Your Philosophy, Finding Your style:
Finding your style is one of the most important things to consider in wrestling. It will deteremine your stance, the moves you use, the strategy you choose, and the success you have.  Your style should be based on a number of different factors, many of which will be discussed later in this book.  However right now there are a few basic things to consider, and should serve as a guideline to help you come up with a basic strategy.

#What are your strengths?  Are you a great athlete?  Are you really strong?  Are you extremely bright?  A great athlete will be able to do more complicated moves, whereas someone who is really strong might want to focus on a few basic power moves.  Someone who is extremely bright might try to outmaneuver their opponent into an advantageous position.
#What are your weaknesses?  Do you have trouble with balance? Do you have trouble being aggressive? Are you slower than other wrestlers?  This book aims to help you eliminate most of your weaknessess; however, it is impossible to eliminate all of your weaknesses.  In a match, you should do everything possible to avoid dealing with your weaknessess, then in practice, you should work to eliminate these weaknesses.


*High Vs. Low Percentage moves

*The Clock

*When to be Aggressive


Note: Richard Salamone has generously agreed to let us use any of his posts from the MMA.tv forum, in this section I will put relevant post, which will be edited into book form once the whole book has been outlined.

===What moves to use===
FloorFighter,

I am not sure where you are at in your training, but before focusing on &quot;moves&quot;, learn the so-called basic movements of wrestling.  These prepare you for learning &quot;moves.&quot;

With regard to what is most efficient and most sensible to learn, that does depend on body build (e.g., relatively tall or short), speed (e.g., quick or not), how much of your training you are willing to devote (e.g., BJJ and MMA types will have different goals, e.g., to perhaps mostly defend takedowns vs. initiate leg shot and to also develop some pummeling/cliniching proficiency), etc.

Ultimately, for maximum success, you need to be exposed to a wide variety of technique primarily to be familiar enough so that it is not a surprise and you can defend against it.  You don't, however, need to develop zillions of techiques to be proficient and, in fact, as you are learning, it is my opinion, that it is wiser to focus on a few techniques and set-ups for them and work the heck out of them than &quot;be a jack of all trades and a master of none.&quot;  A good double leg, single leg, a few good tie-ups, pummeling/clinch (with attacks such at front headlock), and defense will get you pretty far.

You don't have to be &quot;unique&quot; to be successful, only good, and good at the basics is a good place to start to be good.

Lee Kemp was a three (I think) time world freestyle champ with a good single, good ties, and good defense.  Boring to watch, yes, but he could get that single on anybody at least once during a match and would typically win  by a point or two or three in generally very low scoring matches (in world competition).

Good luck in your training.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''What is Grammar?''' ==

'''Grammar is the study of how words and their component parts combine to form sentences.'''  Grammar is the scientific study of language that includes ''morphology'' (also &quot;accidence&quot; or the forms that words take) and ''syntax'' (the relation of the words to other words).  Grammar also involves the study of the different parts or elements of speech (for example nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), the relations between those elements. A knowledge of grammar provides a vocabulary to discuss how the language works.

* St. Cloud State University has a great website that is very useful for writers called LEO: http://leo.stcloudstate.edu. 

It is especially great because it is written based on college writing. It is quite in depth and is broken down into many categories so a writer can find what they need.  Access is available for anyone, not limited to students of St. Cloud State University. 


* A writer can use many different reference tools through  St. Cloud State University's website. Among these references includes free access to the Oxford English Dictionary. Go to http://lrts.stcloudstate.edu. 

Click the &quot;Library&quot; link then the &quot;Online References Resources&quot; drop down menu. Here, there will be a list of many useful resources.  Some of these resources are limited to student only use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''History of Cells'''&lt;/big&gt;
[[Image:Cork_Micrographia_Hooke.png|thumb|right|Cells as seen by Robert Hooke.]]
Cells have often been called the building blocks of life, and are indeed found to the basis of everything we generally classify as life (viruses are their own special category).  Cells were discovered by a British scientist named Robert Hooke in 1665.  The name was originally applied to cells found in a cork!  These &quot;cells&quot; looked like little compartments, similar to the living quarters of monks which were called cells.  Much later on, two German scientists discovered the connection between life and cells.  Matthias Schleiden discovered plants are made of cells, while Theodor Schwann realized animals are composed of cells.  We have since learned that bacteria are composed of single cells (unicellular), while more complex forms of life are multicellular.

&lt;big&gt;'''Cell Theory'''&lt;/big&gt;

The ideas of Schleiden and Schwann helped shape modern biology.  From them we have derived a set of rules for living things.  This is known as the &quot;cell theory.&quot;[[Image:Bronchiolar_epithelium_2_-_SEM.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cells in the lung.]]
*An organism is composed of a least one cell. All living things, from unicellular bacteria to complex humans have at least one cell.
*The cell is basic building block of the organism.  It is the lowest organizational structure of all living things.
*All cells come from previous cells.  Cells are made from other cells during a process known as cellular division.

All living things follow these rules (though there are controversial exceptions to these rules).
[[Category:FHSST Biology]]

&lt;big&gt;'''Types of Cells'''&lt;/big&gt;

There are two types of cells that we see in living things.  A prokaryotic cell lacks a nucleus and is not as complicated as a eukaryotic cell.  Prokaryotes, organisms consisting of prokaryotic cells, are usually unicellular. Eukaryotes, on the other hand, normally consist of many cells working together.  Both structures are surrounded by a membrane, but a eukaryote has organelles.  Organelles are sub-units inside the cell with their own membrane, and a specific function (such as producing food for the cell).  The largest organelle in a eukaryote is the nucleus, which acts as a control center for the cell.

==Abstract==
''This paper looks at aspects of Wikipedia’s structure and process, with specific focus on its community (or organisational) learning. Learning is conceptualised as a collective, collaborative process, whereby multiple perspectives are shared and meanings are constructed. Fundamental to this learning are Wikipedia’s policies and the procedure of collaboration in an often conflicting environment. Conflict is viewed as a key component in the process of creating the content of Wikipedia as well as a key factor in people’s participation in the project. A case study of conflict is presented, of which the focus is on how individual users communicate their opinions and feelings to other users and how these communications are read and/or understood by individuals and/or the community, especially in the light of it being mainly a text-only medium. How experiences are shared between and within projects is seen as a crucial factor in its organisational learning – Wikipedia as an organisation has both traditional and radical features, but its learning, as well as so many other aspects of its proclaimed success, is seen to be predicated on its structure, as well as its policies. Recommendations are made to improve its learning as an organisation as well that of individuals, through the idea and praxis of a learning community.''

Keywords: learning community, online community, collaboration, conflict, constructivism, organisational learning

== Introduction ==

Wikipedia, the multilingual, open-content, collaborative encyclopedia, has gone from strength to strength. In four-and-a-half years it has grown to contain over two million articles in over 200 languages, and counting. The idea of collaborative-building of an encyclopedia was seeded by its predecessor Nupedia, operated by an expert-only peer-review system and where the idea of a wiki (user-editable) system was implemented, which sparked its flourishing into the sprawling organism it is today, the biggest encyclopedia in the world. Despite its astonishing size, my main focus of this study resides in analyzing three aspects of Wikipedia as a learning process, specifically the organisation, structure and modus operandi of Wikipedia. I am not focusing exclusively on Wikipedia, but also its sister projects (see fig. 1) and its parent, the Wikimedia Foundation (a non-profit organisation, currently registered in U.S., France and Germany, with plans underway for others). Data for this research is mainly obtained from (1) the content and discussion pages from English Wikipedia and Meta, discussions related to Wikipedia, and mailing lists.

My overarching reason for writing this paper is to make recommendations to the community for improving its practice, ie the collaborative writing of an encyclopedia. My objective is, by the end of this paper, to have convinced both the ‘non-Wikipedian’ reader that Wikipedia is a model worth serious consideration, and also the Wikipedian that the good start that has been made needs to be reinforced, or even in parts, restructured. In so doing, I want to redress the imbalance noted by Feenberg (2004) in that previous studies of online communities have tended to describe the workings of the community for an external audience without addressing the needs of the communities or their participants themselves. I also, most importantly, hope to frame the discourse of Wikipedia in terms of it ''actually being a learning community'', rather than as a model, or way of looking at it.

While Wikipedia is not constructed or conceived as a learning environment per se, it does have some interesting characteristics of one. In this paper, I will frame the activities of its users in the light of the theory around learning communities, learning organisations and communities of practice. All of these have their own particularities and they all overlap in parts, but all, I think, are present in the continued work and functioning of Wikipedia. I shall therefore look at each area, in an attempt to come to a better understanding of how best to synthesise them.


== Communities of practice ==

Wenger and Snyder (2000) say that communities of practice: 1) set their own agendas (self-organising), 2) are open to all who are willing to participate (self-selective) and 3) learn and grow through time and hence reinforce their strengths and capabilities (self-perpetuating). Unlike many other online communities, Wikipedia exists for a definite purpose and very real work is being done continuously, as I write and as you read, making it more like other work-based communities of practice than an online discussion group, for example. Wikipedia’s goal, its raison d’etre, is very simply to create and distribute an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet in a language they can easily understand (WMF:Main Page) or, in the classic phrase, “of the people, for the people”. This overlaps with the second point above which characterises the entirely voluntary membership of Wikipedia, and which goes for all of its languages and their subprojects (eg. finding sources, article translations – themselves ‘semi-communities’), as well as of course its sister projects (ie. Wiktionary etc.), placing Wikipedia in a straddling role between the Tönnies' (1887) classic demarcation of community and civil society. It also goes somewhat for roles within the communities, like adminship or membership of the dispute resolution process, although these are based on community approval and usually involve a vote. The third point, of course, is the difficult one, and the one I will be focusing on here. To what extent does ‘growth’ and ‘learning’ take place within the community at large and in the smaller communities within this/these communities, and how does it work or can it be done? These are my research questions.

Growth (in size at least) is easily quantified (Voss, 2005); learning, however, is not. But what, at least, do contributors to Wikipedia feel they have learned? To this question, I have been told (apart from “reams of trivia”): how to do research, how to write better academically, how to read and write better in another language, how to get on with and work with members of another culture and to be generally critical of the media in its presentation of information (Lawler, 2005). 


== Organisations, leadership and learning ==

“Hierarchical authority,” writes Peter Senge (1996), “(..) tends to evoke compliance, not foster commitment” (p. 2). Citing Argyris (1994), he claims that the problems of traditional organisations are that they stifle potentially damaging information for self-preservation purposes, when in fact this is precisely the kind of information that is needed for their development. He then goes on to advocate the conception of new types of leadership in order to improve the flow of communication

While Wikipedia does have a somewhat hierarchical system, ie. project administrators, mediation and arbitration committees (on the English Wikipedia) and a board of trustees overseeing the Wikimedia foundation, it offsets this with a decentralised structure throughout. Except for occasional foundation decisions, it is possible to take part in any discussion on policy, directly upon arrival to Wikipedia, whether logged in or not. It is also possible to apply for adminship of any project, once proof of sufficiently substantial edits is given, in many cases after only a month or so of contributing. Essentially, Wikipedia is a composite of many structural systems (M:Power structure) to go alongside the view of a completely open, flat system (Aigrain, 2003). But its openness is still its most basic, enduring and all-pervasive quality (Lawler, 2005) and how, in the final analysis, it must be viewed.

Of course, no discussion of the leadership of Wikipedia is complete without reference to its co-founder Jimmy (Jimbo) Wales. Other co-founder Larry Sanger left after Wikipedia’s first year, having contributed greatly to its workings and principles (at that time), and continues to play an ‘outsider’ role (Sanger, 2004); but it is still very much Wales who retains a uniquely central role in Wikipedia/Wikimedia. His title is disputed (by himself, mainly), but Wales does retain special rights in ultimately safeguarding the project in maintaining its goals and values. He remains quite self-deprecating about his role, and tends to make minimal intrusion into community process; as Anthere wrote on the wikipedia-l mailing list: 

:''“I think a project of such a type can only work ''without'' a strong authority. It is important to let people build their own organisation. Jimbo has this very powerful strength, in that he lets most of the organisation be a self-organisation. For those who know a bit about leadership, it is a rather rare occurence.”'' (23/05/05, ed. C.L., my emphasis, from
:http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2005-April/039181.html)

Essentially, leadership is an open invitation in Wikipedia, and dependent upon people taking roles within the organisation as spelled out by Senge (1996, 2003). Philippe Aigrain (2003) states that the success of analogous ‘information communities’ depend on certain people playing certain roles, such as by referring to useful information, moderating (eg. conflict), challenging opinions etc. We are encouraged to &quot;be bold&quot; and to take matters into our own hands. Also, the praxis of this community is such that it pays to help each other and point out interesting pages, discussions, or simply beautiful images, thus taking from Bordieu's notion of cultural capital or, in a current guise, the gift economy. We help each other - I have said so on my user page and I see my role thus far as being a &quot;questioner&quot; in Wikipedia, which explains the approach taken in my research and the reason I am writing this paper (W:User:Cormaggio). 


== Learning communities ==

Pedagogy has been steadily changing over the last fifty years to reflect the growing view of both knowledge and learning as socially constructed (Cuthell, 2002). Consequently, a drive to make learning more socially situated has begun, with more of a focus on student-student interaction than student-teacher, in order to make it easier for students to share experiences, give each other feedback and learn from each other. A learning community is therefore, rather unsurprisingly, a specifically constructed community of learners.

Greene (2005) says that taking part in a learning community “allows learning to be contextual and social, as well as distributed” (p. 7). Contextual means that learning is situated in the context of where it is learned, eg. operating a machine, in a classroom, on a mailing list etc. The communal element is what makes the learning both social and distributed, in that the experience is shared and collaborative; in this respect the notion of a ‘cohort group’ is useful, in the sense of it being mutually supportive and a potential place for personal growth (Tisdell et al., 2004).

I see many (even, perhaps, any) groups in Wikipedia as being such cohort groups. There are mini-projects within the various language projects that focus on specific tasks, whether it be finding references, improving coverage of a field of study or helping to translate articles or messages between languages. All of these are kinds of cohort groups, and all are potentially learning communities. For instance, a project grew for a while between the Balkan (and environs) Wikipedias to work on a way of representing the past decade of conflict there in a neutral manner, acceptable to differing cultural points of view. The project has since petered out, but is just one example of a group of people coming together to work on a common problem. Potentially, this could be said about any content page in Wikipedia, where the principle of neutrality is constantly negotiated, though itself, in the words of Jimmy Wales, “non-negotiable” (W:NPOV).

Another continuously developing project is the software, the underlying architecture of Wikipedia. Like all open-source software, MediaWiki, upon which all Wikimedia projects run, (W:MediaWiki) is itself freely downloadable and editable. Lawrence Lessig (2004) says the openness of the internet, and particularly open source technology, gives people the opportunity to “tinker” and thereby learn through experience about writing, designing and producing media by and for themselves. Tinkering is also central to Eric Raymond’s (2000) view of creativity and freedom in decentralised collective working; even the byline for MediaWiki, “Because ideas want to be free”, reinforces this message.

So, stated above are some notions of what constitute the major components of the theory on the area of community and learning and how Wikimedia projects may relate. But the questions now arise: does learning actually take place, and if so, how and to what extent? A further, more practical question from my perspective in writing this paper is, what are the learning opportunities in Wikipedia?


== Wikipedia: learning opportunities ==

Apart from the dynamics of distributed learning-through-discovery, the main potential for learning, in my opinion, is conflict. Conflict arises for many reasons in many guises, whether through difference of culture, ideology or belief, or simple misunderstanding, prevalent in a text-only medium. It may be about the presentation of content in a partisan manner, or whether a particular piece of information or image etc. should be there at all. It is the main source of heat generated in the project and comprises a huge part of the general discussion that I have seen. These conflicts often spill over into flames or edit wars, sometimes with little or no discussion on potential solutions, but simple deadlock. This is where third parties come in, sometimes voluntarily by themselves, or else by request to comment on, or directly mediate/arbitrate in the dispute.

The words conflict and dispute connote negative images, often justifiably so, though sometimes not. Conflict can be very much constructive or at least productive, depending on the form it takes. Reagle (2004) warns against “facile agreement” in the avoiding of conflict within Wikipedia, and says that it bears the potential for sharing perspectives. A conflict, by nature, comprises multiple perspectives and is thus an opportunity for debate but depends on whether the nature of the conflict is constructive or destructive. In fact, a destructive conflict should be viewed as an extreme form of discussion, even if discussion has broken down. The way to solve a dispute is through discussion; this is fundamental to the general community and, in particular, the Mediation Committee (W:Mediation).

Discussion is the basic state of Wikipedia, between talk pages, mailing lists and IRC channels, and it is as such that the notion of a place of perspective-sharing comes into its own. Returning to the concept of leadership advocated by Senge (1996), the role of leaders is to make sure that communication is happening throughout the organisation; if we transpose this concept to the completely decentralised structure of Wikipedia, we can see that everyone has the potential to take on any one of these leadership roles and consequently to form and frame the work of the community as a whole.

A major aspect of discussion/communication, certainly in a multilingual environment, is that of cultural background. Cross-cultural communication literature is already a big part of business practice, but it is growing within the field of education. Liebkind and McAlister (1999) conducted a study whereby students engaged in story-telling about other countries and cultures and consequently were significantly less xenophobic than students in schools who had not taken part in the activity. It would be interesting to do some research on this in Wikipedia, to see if this finding bore out, but of primary interest (to me at least) is how the discourse of Wikipedia is conducted and how cultural issues are dealt with, and how language is used. As Ferdinand Tönnies (1887) says, “language has not, as we all know, been ‘invented’ or somehow agreed upon as a mere tool for making ourselves understood; it is the very act of understanding at work, both in form and content”. (p. 33) Particularly in the text-based medium of computer-mediated-communication, the language used is crucial to coming to consensus in a conflicting territory.

Finally, being involved in a project such as Wikipedia requires the development of critical thinking, as is often repeated. Wikipedia is a filtering process in the age of information (WMF:Quarto2 letter), and to decide what is eligible and appropriate to enter requires critical faculties. I think that being critical also requires one to be open to criticism of oneself and to avoid defensive reasoning, which according to Argyris (1991) “encourages individuals to keep private the premises, inferences, and conclusions that shape their behavior and to avoid testing them in a truly independent, objective fashion” (p. 103).


== Conflict: a case study ==

One example (among many) this year of conflict and cross-cultural issues was a dispute over the representation of the Cassini-Huygens telescope launched into space as a collaborative venture between US and European scientists. Anthere claimed on the wikiEN-l mailing list that some French scientists had mentioned to her that the represented format of the event on the English Wikipedia was subtly but noticeably biased against the European-built Huygens probe. This point was contested as either being either irrelevant or unfair, and the issue became a dispute, in parts personal and, to an extent, nationalistic. I have presented key points from the participants, taking excellent but not specifically related points out, and for the sake of style and clarity, I have edited some of the comments themselves. Also, since it was discussed in this thread, and having asked the question myself in another, I think there is no benefit from disguising the names of those involved, or more practically, no way of referencing this discussion without identifying its participants (Bruckman, 2002). I also do not wish to cause offence to anyone by bringing this debate out into the open again, but rather think of it as a strong case of perspective sharing, misunderstanding, apology and resolution.


Anthere (15th Jan, 05)
:I am sure it was not done on purpose at all. This is just a view of things so different between one culture and another.

Stan Shebs (15th Jan, 05): 
:I think you're working a bit too hard to find bias here. (..) The &quot;bias&quot; is that we work on what interests us. I've been digging figures of European history out of 1911EB lately, and half the time it's the first information about these in any language WP. We're just perennially short of people to do all the things we would like to get done.
:http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-January/018353.html

Anthere (15th Jan, 05)
:No I am not working too hard. (..) If we want to be perceived reasonably neutral, we just have to pay attention to this type of details. That's all what I would like to say. Consider it crap if you wish.
:http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-January/018355.html

Stan Shebs (15th Jan, 05)
:This is absolutely nothing to do with NPOV, and it's unfair to hardworking editors to say that they're biased and not doing anything about it. What you report fits exactly into the worst stereotypes of the French; sneering at other people's work, but not taking any responsibility for having let this perceived problem go unmentioned for years. You said these scientists “know Wikipedia”; did you ask them why they didn’t do anything about it themselves?
(..)
:There are enough real problems making WP unbiased and neutral; by taking a trivial point of organization never before discussed anywhere, and holding it up as something that matters, you're undercutting all the editors who put in real research and real discussion time on the issues that are genuinely important. Why should I bother spending two hours in the library to research a substantive question, when you're telling the world that WP is biased because some frontpage article doesn't cater enough to nationalistic pride?

:The whole attitude really troubles me. I've put in a lot of WP time over the past two years, and now it feels like it doesn't matter.
:http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-January/018393.html 

Anthere (15th Jan, 05): 
(..)
:We are all biaised, and little can be done about this.

(..)
:But yes, why would I even neglect my whole family and personal job as well as personal health by lack of sleep to try to take care of a project, and try to make it the best possible and the least biased possible, when you are telling me that my opinion has no importance whatsoever, is fantasm and only nationalistic pride ?

(..)
:I can understand that some of you just do not see where the problem is and think I am just nut. That is okay, you can consider I am nut and that there is no bias here. I can accept that. This is exactly where the problems stand when we come to lack of neutrality. One editor considers one point of view and another will not necessarily see the same point of view at all. And this is exactly why we have edit wars, because the second will just not recognise the validity of the first one view and will just refuse that the other one could have a piece of truth in his hands. That is fine. What is not fine is to resort to personal comments on those having a perception that you do not share, and try to lower the possible validity of what they say by resorting of calling her &quot;French&quot;.

:I feel quite upset by your comment. If you wish to close your eyes to internal comments, or to attack those of us who try to point out to what is not perfect, do not be suprised when there is criticism from public audience.

:I apologize to those who participated to the article if they feel I criticized their work. I did not.

Stan Shebs (16th Jan, 05)
:(Re: Anthere’s original comment)
:It's a very very bad thing to say to people who take issues of bias and npov seriously (..) This is a public mailing list; all the messages are carefully archived forever, then carefully indexed by Google, and if past experience is any guide, there's a good chance that your initial message will be brought out as support for one side or another in an edit war. (..)

:A question as simple as &quot;why doesn't the Huygens probe have its own article?&quot; is usually enough to spur a flurry of edits by knowledgeable people. Those of us who are serious about bias will drop everything else to look at that sort of thing and try to fix it. I think that's part of why your original comment hurts; I've sacrificed a bunch of time working on subjects that I personally don't enjoy, just to try to address other people's claims of bias.

:(Re: ‘French stereotypes’)
:I thought hard about whether to include this, and I fear I was misinterpreted. I personally don't have this feeling; I love France, would go more often if I could, and since November I'm wondering if I could emigrate there. (..)

:I'm sorry to have upset you, that was not my intent.

Zoney 18/01/05:
:(Re: Bias)
:It's a huge problem I think, and one of Wikipedia's biggest to overcome. And denying that it is there is absurd. And I'm not laying the blame solely with US wikipedians, far from it - US bias is just more apparant (to non-US editors) because there are more US editors than not (or than any other single category). I have no doubt there are a minority of articles biased against the US which have perhaps only received non-US editors. And speaking for myself I can for sure point out one or two Irish articles which have been biased by Irish editors for example.

Though this exchange was relatively short (compared to, say, the infamous debates over images and censorship), I think most people involved showed a great measure of maturity and thinking about one another’s perspective, even if it did cause offence. What’s interesting about this exchange for me primarily is that it was rich in emotion and honesty. Of course the content of the dispute, ie. (systemic) bias in the English Wikipedia, is vital to the community, but this issue is a long-standing one and not one likely to have been resolved immediately. 

Like religion, issues of national identity are likely to inflame passions, and this is what happened here (as it has again very recently, in not dissimilar circumstances). Stan’s comments were thoughtful but potentially hurtful, since he himself was hurt, and this made for a heated discussion. Anthere’s comments were full of her characteristic fire, but more importantly, her humanity. Brian tried to diffuse the situation by denying a national bias and tried to inject some humour. And Zoney’s comment was a good indication of the wider picture and a restatement of the difficulty in avoiding bias.

It is exchanges like this that I think are perfect for learning. They include emotional honesty, cultural sensitivity and humility when appropriate. It is an example of the daily discourse within Wikipedia (though, obviously, not all debates will play out like this one), but it is also an indication of the measure by which Wikipedia may be judged, ie. as a culturally sensitive resource and/or community. Potentially, it could serve as a warning to contributors to the issues around cultural identity and bias, though this would need further research. Ultimately though, this discussion shows the dominant discourse of Wikipedia to be centred on neutral and balanced representation and finding the consensus to do so.

== Building Wikipedia ==

The construction of an online community is usefully conceptualised under Jenny Preece’s (2001) notions of sociability and usability, or in other words, how much consideration exists for people’s potential interaction with the community and its technology or modus operandi. “The focus of sociability”, Preece says, “is human-human interaction supported by technology” (p. 349) whereas usability is more concerned with how easy it is to access, navigate and retrieve information from and about the community. I particularly find her suggestions for supporting online social interaction (Preece, 2003) to be inherent insights into understanding the praxis of learning in Wikipedia.

Sociability is achieved in many ways on Wikipedia, mainly through logging in and creating a user page (or, at least, a username) by which you can be recognised and contacted. There are many other modes of communication, eg. mailing lists as stated above, but there are also other ways of getting to know people such as Facebook on English Wikipedia (W:Facebook). This has been shown to be important for the affective needs of participants (eg. Sunal et al., 2003) as well as being a way to introduce oneself and outline topics/fields of interest/expertise, both of which have recently been discussed on the mailing lists. On the mode of discussion, apart from IRC, Wikipedia is an asynchronous format, but, in setting up a watchlist, its functionality allows for quick feedback, another of Sunal et al.’s (2003) criteria for successful online learning community building. Issues of sociability will undoubtedly prove relevant to the development of the upcoming e-learning resource, currently known as Wikiversity.

As outlined above, Wikipedia is being constantly constructed, new versions of its code being released with regularity. This continual flux is just how Vannevar Bush (1945) saw the practice of information storage in his classic essay ''As we may think'' when he says, 

:''“a record, if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted. (..) Even if utterly new recording procedures do not appear, these present ones are certainly in the process of modification and extension.”''

Wikipedia is not only a continuously evolving resource, but also a continuously evolving entity in site, structure and community. Feenberg (2004) says that new media have to be seen as a process, not as a finished product, lest they become the sole preserve of experts. I am fully aware that this will ring alarm bells in the pro-expertise camp, but this is missing the point: that a developing media should not be fully conceptualised while it is still in process which is very much the case in Wikipedia, as it is the view of many of its users (Lawler, 2005)

== Reflection and meta-cognition ==

Probably the most useful model of learning is that put forward by Kolb and others which views the process as a cycle going from 1) experience, to 2) reflection, to 3) abstract conceptualisation, to 4) active experimentation leading back again to experience (Gibbs, 1988). In plainer terms, this means learning from an experience through a process of reflection and relating past thinking to the experience in order to inform further experiences or practice. Reflective practice is key to understanding our own actions, and thereby learning from them. As Paulo Freire puts it, “Critical reflection on practice is a requirement of the relationship between theory and practice” (Freire, 1998, p. 30) – otherwise, theory becomes meaningless and practice, mindless.

The existence of Meta, and the call for papers for Wikimania itself, is evidence enough of a reflective stance within the larger community (M:Main page; WM:Call for papers). Interestingly, Anthere said that taking part in Meta can take the strain away from contributing to Wikipedia, which can be stressful due to having to write an acceptably neutral opinion; on Meta it is not obligatory (or even advisable) to write from a neutral perspective, but rather to write freely on any aspect of the projects, like where there is a problem, and how it could be improved, or philosophical or sociological aspects of Wikipedia, like for instance the structure of power (M:Power structure; M:Wikipedia:Sociology). This kind of meta-discussion forum is an essential ingredient of what Bieber et al. (2002) call for in their proposals for the evolution of knowledge communities. Wikipedia also answers the call by Ripamonti et al. (2005) for online communities to work out their usage and performance (W:Statistics), and this is open to anyone who has the technical ability (or time and patience to learn) to hack into the MediaWiki software, currently undertaken by Erik Zachte.

Commenting on the internet's influence on our perceptions of time, Ilkka Tuomi (2002) wrote: “On the net we live in dog years, but our memory is that of an elephant” (cited in Holtgrewe, 2004, p. 131). In terms of memory, the transparent structure of Wikipedia does offset this substantially, but the challenge is to maintain the collective memory of the community to continue the process of reflection, and hence, learning. The crucial point here though is that the community continues to be critical of itself and make sense of its various experiences in order to reinforce the quality of its future practice and discourse.

== Conclusions ==

Central, I believe, to the success of Wikipedia is the nature of its participation and the behaviour of its contributors. Much of these issues is covered in policy and guidelines, but much of it comes down to why people get involved and how. The reasons for contributing to Wikipedia are many (Lawler, 2005; W:Wikipedia:Who&amp;Why) and it is clear that many of its most active contributors consider it to be an essential part of their lives, restated around the May 2005 appointment of Foundation officers by Vice-Chair of the board, Florence Nibart-Devouard (Anthere) and the then Chief Research Officer, Erik Möller (Eloquence).

Set against this, however, is possibly the fear of messing up an article, due to lack of language proficiency or knowledge in the area - issues which were raised in the conflict case study mentioned above (though not reproduced here). Chris Allen (2005) also wrote on people's attitudes to participation:

:''“One interesting possible barrier of entry to active participation in a wiki is what I call the &quot;wiki editing dichotomy&quot;. You have to be proud enough to believe what you are contributing is generally worthwhile to others (or at least worth your effort), but you also have to be humble enough to understand that others can improve it. I don't know of many other collaborative media that requires both pride and humility.”''

Militantly meritocratic, Eric Raymond (2003) states bluntly, “attitude is no substitute for competence”. I differ in that I think the key is to temper the meritocracy of Wikipedia (no bad thing in itself) with an appreciation of the cultural value of the individual and the role that each brings with them to the project. It seems to me that Wikipedia, as a project built on the spirit of cooperation, will only succeed in an atmosphere of openness and, crucially, listening. I believe I have shown its good side to a large extent, but any contributor to the Wikimedia community (especially, it seems the English Wikipedia) will be aware of the destructive and sometimes hurtful quality of comments made, or even ignored.


'''Further work on Wikipedia'''

Research in and on Wikipedia is gaining momentum, as people, myself included, flock to it as a fascinating case study in the era of the internet. The incentive for Wikipedia to itself do internal research is ever-growing as the English Wikipedia’s recent drive to initiate article validation, after the success of the German Wikipedia in producing a DVD of its best content. The Wikimedia research network is further evidence of a consolidated effort to gain understanding about the various projects and how best their technical and social needs may be met (M: Wikimedia Research Network). This study has been more of an overall reading of the literature and how it applies to Wikipedia but I also hope to have shed some light on its process, particularly conflict, to improve or at least inform its future practice. Further research needs to be done in many areas, in both quantitative and especially qualitative studies. Qualitative studies are often quite complex and raise important ethical issues, like disclosure of identity, which I have chosen to do here after consultation with the main participants and in the light of Bruckman's (2002) ideas on publishing and publicity. But the crucial point is that we continually inquire into and reflect upon our own practice, in order to better understand it and improve on it for the future.

Findings from the literature on online communities and learning communities are still tentative, but it would be interesting to put a number of them to the test. For instance, Norris (2002) found that online community participation did not have much significant positive effect on contacts across social divides, but that it did across age-gaps – is this the case in Wikipedia? And what about across cultures and, particularly, ideologies? How do projects/communities cross-fertilise each other and do people shy away from some projects and not others? (Stacey, Smith and Barty, 2004) And in terms of Wikipedia really being a learning community and its participants cohort learners, Sujo de Montes, Oran and Willis (2002) ask, “How do we encourage some students to find their voices and speak powerfully and others to find their ears and learn to listen?” (p. 269) These, alongside the many other questions raised on (WM:Call for papers) will serve to enrich and strengthen the process of collaborative working and learning.

Therefore, I make here a number of recommendations that could contribute to the learning of the community overall:

* Learning to become a core competency in the Wikipedia community
* Recognition of the importance of constructive conflict
* Research to explore relationships between projects and possibilities for sharing perspectives and learning
* ‘Lessons learnt’ pages to be created and maintained on Meta

The main work in Wikipedia and all other Wikimedia projects is to continue to work in a collaborative and open sense and, I believe, with the attitude of shared learning. This for me is Wikipedia's strongest asset and the most radical answer to Larry Sanger's and others' criticisms of Wikipedia regarding expertise - that in building a product of excellence, Wikipedia is also building a learning community where leadership is decentralised and expertise is distributed and in so doing creating a new kind of academic community, as already suggested to me by a participant in my previous study (Lawler, 2005). But as it develops its own mode of discourse (Lamerichs &amp; Te Molder, 2003) and its own critical viewpoint, it must make sure that this experience is synthesised into something explicitly useful to the community - we must balance our desire for ongoing distributed learning (or &quot;editor education&quot;, as Tony Sidaway (2005) suggests) with documented information, ie through 'lessons learnt', by which newcomers can themselves learn from Wikipedians' previous experiences. As Lehtinen (2002) puts it:

:''“Knowledge structures based solely on informal and “tacit” knowledge can be very inflexible and provide only limited opportunities for continuous knowledge advancement, typical for dynamic expertise. On the other hand, high-level expert performances cannot be adequately described as individual accomplishments since they are typically based on the use of socially and physically distributed resources. Correspondingly, the view of learning that focuses only on the cultivation of individual minds may be too narrow when developing  teaching–learning environments for supporting the development of expertise.”'' (p. 110)

This emphasises the communal nature of learning, which I believe to be central to both the praxis, progress and even the very notion of Wikipedia. But it also poses us a challenge in making explicit this collective memory whereby the newbies have just as much a chance of benefiting from the community as do the old-timers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) (17 U.S.C. §§ 117, 512, 1201 et. seq.). Enacted in 1998, and codified as amendments to the Copyright Act, the DMCA addressed a number of computer-related issues: 

Implements two 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties: The WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.

Notice and Take-Down Provisions (17 U.S.C. § 512): Provides a “safe harbor” to Internet service providers (“ISPs,” a broadly defined term that includes most website operators). ISPs are protected from claims of copyright infringement arising from the posting of copyrighted materials on websites if they reasonably implement and inform users of the ISP’s policy that provides for the identification and termination of infringing material. 

(Note: The ISP must act to remove the infringing works or it may be liable for any resulting damages.)

Anti-hacking provisions (17 U.S.C. § 1201, et. seq.): Prohibits circumvention of technological measures that effectively control access to a copyrighted work as well as prohibits the manufacture, production, trafficking in or offering of any technology, product, service or device that is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a copyrighted work.

Maintenance and repair provision (17 U.S.C. § 117): Expands Section 117 of the Copyright Act to authorize an owner of a copy of a computer program to make a copy of the program so long as the copy is made as an essential step in the utilization of the program or for purposes of maintenance or repair.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Copyright Act of 1976 went into effect January 1, 1978. The act protects original works of authorship, including computer software programs, by investing the author with the exclusive right to copy, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly display and publicly perform the copyrighted work, generally for a term of the life of the author plus seventy years.  

The Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act extended the term from life plus 50 to life plus 70 years. The works made for hire term was extended from 75 to 95 years.

Types of work protected:
The Copyright Act protects creative expression in works of authorship (which is defined broadly, with little “creativity” required), but it does not protect facts, ideas, discoveries, processes or methods.

The act also protects databases as creative compilations even though the underlying data may be facts (that are not protected).  

Copyright interests are held by the individual author unless assigned. Copyrights in works created by employees within the scope of their employment are owned by the employer. Copyrights in works created under contract by an independent contractor are retained by the contractor unless an executed assignment or other document provides for a transfer.

Copyright interests attach automatically upon creation of a work of authorship. Copyright registration is optional, but is a prerequisite to commencing an infringement suit. Significant benefits and access to stronger remedies in an infringement suit result from early registration of a copyright.

Downloading music files, graphics or text from the Internet can constitute infringement because an electronic copy of the work is being made. According to some case law, even loading and running a program from disk can be infringement unless authorized by license, since a copy is being made from disk to random access memory.

Note:  There are two legal concepts:
Contributory Infringement  - a person with knowledge of the infringing activity induces causes or materially contributes to the conduct of another to infringe.  

Vicarious Liability - a person or entity has the right and ability to control the activities of the person directly infringing and receives financial benefit from those activities – even if the entity or person is unaware of the activity.

Civil remedies include:
Injunctive relief, actual damages, an accounting of profits and in certain circumstances statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work, as well as impoundment and destruction of equipment and infringement material and paying attorney’s fees.  

Criminal penalties are:
Misdemeanor - up to one year’s imprisonment and fines up to $100,000.
	
Felony - fines up to $250,000 and up to five years’ imprisonment for the first violation and up to 10 years for repeat offenders.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Click-wrap/Shrink-wrap/Download Licenses'''

A shrink-wrap license is generally associated with “off the shelf” software in which the license agreement is contained within the software packaging materials. It is in a standard printed form, and is accepted by the customer when the customer carries out a specified task, such as opening the envelope or the shrink-wrapping containing the CD-ROM (breaking the seal while doing so) or by installing the software. 


A variation is to accept the terms of the onscreen license presented during the setup process before the software is installed on the computer. If the license terms are not accepted, the software will not install. This is referred to as '''click-wrap.''' Frequently, the on-screen acceptance is in addition to the software being delivered in a shrink-wrap but as more and more software is preloaded, the click-wrap methodology performs an important function.


Increasingly, software can be downloaded from Internet websites. In such cases, it would be normal for a customer to be presented with an onscreen license agreement, which can either be accepted or rejected. If not accepted, the software will not download. 


The license terms should be presented to the potential customer before the purchasing mechanics take place. This would ensure that they are effective.

A '''web-wrap''' license is considered an Internet contract that asks that user to accept the terms of the license by clicking a “yes” or “no” button before or after seeing the complete agreement. A “yes” gives the user complete access to the website. A “no” prevents the user from gaining access to all or some of the information on the site. This is also known as a '''click-wrap license.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Someone please verify the &quot;drink alcohol&quot; phrase, because as near as I can figure, this only applies to heavy drinking in combination with smoking increasing chances of throat cancer. 
Also, I'm going to add &quot;treat coughs&quot; and &quot;avoid dairy&quot; as a nasal issue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The correct term for this instrument is a 'bone folder'. It is traditionally fashioned from dense wood or cow-bone.
Commonly it is a double-sided dull knife with one dull pointed pyramid-apex at one end.

=Apple Raisin Oat Muffins=
[[Cookbook:Muffin|Muffins]] are one of many traditional breakfast quickbreads; unlike [[Cookbook:Biscuits|biscuits]], muffins usually contain some form of fruit or other [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]].  These muffins are especially healthy because they are made with [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]].  See the notes at the bottom of the recipe for ideas about how to customize this muffin recipe to your own tastes; the basic proportions should work for any flavor of oat muffin.

==Ingredients==
*1.5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (360 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1.5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (360 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Rolled oats|rolled oats]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbsp]] (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*0.5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (2.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*0.25 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (60 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:White Sugar|granulated sugar]]
*0.25 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (60 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Eggs|whole egg]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], whole or 2%
*0.33 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (80 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|vegetable oil]] (your favorite is fine)
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (480 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]], grated (Granny Smith is an excellent choice)
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (10 mL) [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*0.5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (2.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*0.5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (2.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (5 mL) [[Cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]]
*0.25 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (60 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]

==Equipment==
*Large [[cookbook:mixing bowl|mixing bowl]]
*Smaller mixing bowl
*Measuring cups
*Measuring spoons
*Muffin pan(s)

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 425&amp;nbsp;°F (220&amp;nbsp;°C)
#Grease muffin pans with cold [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]], or pan spray
#In a large bowl, thoroughly combine flour, oats, baking powder and baking soda
#In a smaller bowl, thoroughly combine eggs, sugar, milk, oil, apple, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, vanilla and raisins
#Add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix ''with bare hands'' until just combined.  '''Do not overmix!'''
#Fill muffin cups about three-quarters full, then place on oven's upper rack and turn the oven down to 375&amp;nbsp;°F (190&amp;nbsp;°C)
#Turn muffin pans 180° after 10 minutes; check for doneness after 15 minutes
#Muffins usually take 20 to 25 minutes to cook completely
#Allow to cool briefly (2-5 minutes) before removing from pan

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*'''Optional variations:''' use [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] instead of apple, or dried [[Cookbook:Cranberry|cranberries]] or other dried [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] instead of the raisins.

==Warnings==
*Overmixing will lead to ''worming'', which is caused by [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten development]].  You will see this as vertical tunnels running through your muffins, much like a worm might leave.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If books had been invented after the computer, they would have been considered a big breakthrough. Books have several hundred simultaneous paper-thin, flexible displays. They boot instantly. They run on very low power at a very low cost.  -- Prof. Joseph M. Jacobson, [[W:MIT Media Lab|MIT Media Lab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Creating 'the Last Book' to Hold All the Others |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |newspaper= New York Times |location=New York |date=April 8, 1998 |accessdate=June 03, 2011 |language=English |url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/arts/040898book.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Books tend to be bound in factories these days, but the craft of binding books by hand has been practiced without interruption since the second century AD.  There are many good reasons to learn these techniques, from preserving information to creating works of art in bound form.  Whether the content is centuries old or yet to be created, whether the pages were mass-produced or written longhand, and whether the printing was done with a laser printer, movable type, or not at all, books have the same benefits: they turn a collection of loose, vulnerable pages into a compact, accessible package that's well-protected and easy to store.

Okay, so I think that Muffins and Quickbreads (which include muffins, biscuits, scones, crackers, and anything else leavened with baking soda or baking powder) should be categories.  But then I have a very categorical mind.

Photos of the stages and finished product are forthcoming.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{BookbindingTOC}}
A saddle stitch is appropriate for small booklets and, in general, for volumes with only a few pages.  Most magazines that are not glued are saddle stitched: that is, they are held together by staples that run through the [[Bookbinding/Glossary#gutter|gutter]].
Once the pages are aligned and in the right order, this type of binding is quite straightforward.  Staplers with extremely long jaws, designed specifically for saddle stitching, are available in office supply stores.  Some photocopiers produce saddle-stitched volumes automatically.

If neither of these options is readily available, an improvised saddle stitch can be accomplished by using an ordinary stapler in &quot;tacking&quot; mode.  This usually requires swinging the anvil away from the bottom, or detaching the lower jaw of the stapler.  The working surface should be reasonably soft and durable, such as carpeting or a cork board.  Staples can be driven through the centerline of the pages to be bound, and then bent down individually using the cap of a pen.

Saddle stitching can also be done to the individual [[Wikipedia:bookbinding|codex]], using a needle and thread, as part of the process of binding them together into a larger book.

Perfect binding is not a stitch binding at all, but a solely [[Bookbinding/Adhesive|adhesive]] based binding. It is the easiest and least durable way to produce books, and is how most paperback books are bound. 
Single leaves are jogged to form a straight block, and the spine edge is glued with a hotglue- PUR OR EVA - and glued instantly inside a card cover. Hot glue results in a stiff inflexible spine that is prone to cracking over time.

Below is a description of cold-glue fan-binding which is not perfect binding. A proper description of commercial perfect binding needs to be edited in here and a separate page on cold-glue fan-binding (or double-fan binding) written.

Gluing is done with a stiff brush, and is done with a jabbing or light stabbing motion more than a painting one. 

The text block is held in place by a screw press, or just something heavy, like a couple of bricks for a small book. About an inch on the spine side is left hanging over the table in the case of the bricks, and the glue is brushed onto the spine in layers. Press down on the inch over the table to slant that part of the text block and paint glue over the spine again, so that the glue will get into the little spaces between the very edge of the pages. Then, holding the text block, slant the spine pages upward. Without the screw press, these two steps could get all of your pages scattered on the floor if you are not careful. Finally, letting the text block return to its unslanted state, paint glue on again. 

You will need to press the glued pages together at this point and reinforce with a piece of mull that is the same height as the book; otherwise, you will find that the glue will separate the pages sufficiently where you may end up with two or three books instead of one. If you have a screw press, drop the book into the press so that the spine takes pressure and let the glue set in this manner. Protect your book and press with some waxed paper, being careful not to adhere the wax paper to the spine. If you don't have a screw press, take some boards (binder's board, wooden boards) and use these to protect and distribute the weight of the pressure you apply, whether it be in the press or with bricks.

After this dries, the cover is generally glued to the spine to complete the book. Be aware that if you reinforce with mull and intend to glue the book into an existing cover, you will have space issues. If you are making the cover to fit afterwards, there will be no such difficulty.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergefrom|Transwiki:Fishing for pike}}
When '''fishing for pike''' it is useful to know that it is fond of shady places and in summer they frequent the coolest areas in a river; springs, shadows and deep spots)

They generally spawn in March or April and earlier in some Southern streams. In winter they get under rocks, or stumps, or into convenient deep holes, and they can be taken then with small live fish for bait. Often '''Pike''' can be found near the mouth of some small stream emptying into the river; the fall of the year is the best time for catching them.

In the hot summer months they will seldom bite at all, except, perhaps, in a very windy day. In the fall, too, they are in better condition. Pike fishing in the spring is sometimes very successful; however, though the fish are not so good when breeding. In the more northern waters they are sometimes taken as early as August in good condition.

The tackle used for picke is a pretty stiff 10 foot rod, with a reel, and some 50 or 60 yards of flax line which should be protected by the hook with ''gimp'' or wire. The Limerick or Kirby salmon hook is used. The size is 0 to 5, according to the size of the fish. IN a running stream, the sinker and float will also be found necessary. The bait should be a small live fish, or frog, or the hind leg of a frog skinned. In using live bait, when the pike takes it, do not draw your line too quick. The bait, if properly impaled, will be very lively, and will be apt to make a violent effort to escape its enemy. Inexperienced anglers may take this movement for a veritable bite; but when the bite comes, there is no mistaking it. 

In impaling a small fish for bait, pass the hook under the back fin, just under the roots of its rays. This will not disable the fish, and it will appear lively in the water. When using live frog bait, you pass the hook through the skin of the back or belly, or the back muscle of the hind legs. The live frog is generally used on the top of the water - if not, you should let him rise occasionally to take the air. When the pickerel has seized your bait, give him plenty of time to swallow it, and also plenty of line. Sometimes he will hold it in his mouth and play with it before gorging. 

Lures Can also be very effective even in small waters, and can be often quickly worked as Pike espacially in shallows can be very unselective.

== Landing ==
Keep in mind that Northern Pike often are sporadic fighters and not afraid to be drawn to shore.  A fish slowly worked to shore can be surprisingly '''green''' or unsubdued and can put on a tremondous burst of speed and effort when approached.  Many anglers have found out the hard way that you cannot man handle a live pike.

Pike, (as well as other Esox) have lots of teeth, a very boney gill cover and have boney mouths.  They are notoriouly hard to hook and keep hooked and if a green Pike is brough to the hand, when can get serious cut by the thrashing fish or your lures, which might have 6-9 hooks itself.

As one angler has said, once you catch them soon after the excitement ebbs and the fears begins.  Only celebrate your victory against one of Americas biggest predators AFTER you have escaped unscathed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:United States|United States]]

A food that is popular in Italy and the north east USA, '''Tomato Pie''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Pizza|Pizza]]. Sometimes mistakenly considered an American dish, it is commonly found in bakeries throughout Italy and other countries, where it is simply called [[Cookbook:Pizza|Pizza]] and is often bought and consumed on the spot.

'''Tomato Pie''' is generally made with canned tomatoes. In the USA, it is usually served at room temperature, however many bakeries, where it is often bought as fast food, will reheat slices upon request.

Many bakeries and pizzerias have their own variation on the basic recipe.

The basic recipe features thick pizza dough covered with a thick tomato sauce. After cooking the pizza is sprinkled with grated Romano cheese.

==Ingredients==
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|extra-virgin olive oil]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 large can [[Cookbook:Tomato|crushed tomatoes]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] (450g) pizza dough
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] grated Pecorino Romano cheese

== Procedure ==
#Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|250C]] (450°F). 
#Stretch the pizza dough to cover a greased baking sheet. Dough should be about 3cm (3/4&quot;) thick. 
#Allow the dough to rise while the sauce is prepared.
#Heat a saucepan on medium heat, add the olive oil and garlic. 
#[[Cookbook:Saute|Sauté]] until garlic is just golden. 
#Add crushed tomatoes and oregano.
#Cook until the sauce is thickened, about 15-20 minutes. 
#Cool the sauce until it is room temperature. 
#Top the pizza dough with the sauce, bake in the oven for about 15-20 minutes.
#After removing the tomato-pie from the oven, sprinkle the cheese on top and then let the pizza cool to room temperature.

Serve at room temperature or reheat under the broiler or in a toaster-oven.

This style of tomato pie is very common in the Philadelphia area as well, available at most pizza parlors and Italian bakeries. They're probably common wherever there are concentrations of Italian-Americans.--[[User:BillFlis|BillFlis]] 18:47, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

Cultural determinism is a term used to describe the concept that culture determines economic and political arrangements. It is an idea which has recurred in many cultures over human history, from ancient civilisations through the present. Social construction of technology (also referred to as SCOT) is a form of Cultural Determinism, and a branch of the Science and Technology Studies. Topicly, it includes Social Shaping of Technology, Actor-network theory and Sociotechnical System Theory (developed by Thomas P. Hughes) among others) which is a branch of the sociology of science and technology. It draws on work done in the constructivist school of the sociology of scientific knowledge, as a response to technological determinism. Social constructivists argue that technology does not determine human action, but that human action shapes technology. Social structures are embedded in technologies which shape how users use them.

Leading writers in this field include Wiebe Bijker, Trevor Pinch and Bruno Latour.

== Brief discussion ==
In theories of social development, there are a number which believe that one element is the factor which determines all of the others. One of the most famous is Marx's theory of economic determinism, namely that an individual or class' role in the means of production determines outlook and cultural roles. The idea of cultural determinism is extremely common: numerous societies have believed that their habits, ideas and customs were what determined the shape of their political and economic arrangements, and were the source of their uniqueness above all else. This can be seen in adherence to national epics, particular religious customs, and focus on the importance of language as the determiner of national identity.

Cultural determinism is not limited to one part of the political spectrum or to any one of the Social sciences, but is instead a paradigm used by a variety of writers and thinkers.

== Examples of Cultural determinism ==
There was a prevalent belief among ancient Greeks believed that only those who spoke their language could understand their thought and political arrangements, others were called barbaroi from which the English word barbarian is derived. This identification of culture and politics can be seen in the dual use of the word nomos, which meant both law, and customs or practices. The English words economics and astronomy have nomos as a root word, and reflect this dual meaning.

Niccolò Machiavelli, while he argued that political behavior was universal, also pointed out that elements of culture, particularly religion, could produce particular political arrangements which were advantageous to those that had them.

Sociologist Max Weber wrote about the relationship between Protestantism and Capitalism, arguing that the cultural aspects of religion, including the Protestant work ethic were crucial in the emergence of economic arrangements.

Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel. In the context of Romanticism, the geography molded individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography arose, and these, being in harmony with the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.

In Media theory many writers take the position that political arrangements are determined by the mass media images that people see, and that these, by displacing other forms of culture, determine the economic and political arrangements.

In modern Conservatism, individuals such as commentator Patrick Buchanan and economist Robert Barro argue that cultural norms determine the behavior of political arrangements.

== Criticism ==
In 1993, Langdon Winner pubished an influential critique of SCOT entitled &quot;Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology.&quot; In it, he raises a few problems with social constructivism:
# It explains how technologies arise, but ignores the effects of the technology after the fact.
# It is a social construction of knowledge in itself, subject to the same limitations as it postulates (&quot;Who says what are relevant social groups and social interests?&quot;)
# It disregards dynamics which are not due to its &quot;preferred conceptual strawman: technological determinism.&quot;

Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology. Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has &quot;effects&quot; on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads. However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership. Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies. It would also be possible to claim that a road network changes the way in which goods are distributed around the country and this, in turn, changes a populations' patterns of consumption. The car also made the suburbs possible.

Technological determinism stands in opposition to the theory of the social construction of technology, which holds that both the path of innovation and the consequences of technology for humans are strongly if not entirely shaped by society itself, through the influence of culture, politics, economic arrangements, and the like.
Yeshh Yeshh ;)

According to Bahá'í teachings, religious history is seen as an evolving educational process for mankind, through God's messengers, which are termed [[:W:en:Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]]. [[/Baha'u'llah|Bahá'u'lláh]] is seen as the most recent, pivotal, but not final of these individuals. He claimed to be the expected redeemer and teacher prophesied in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and other religions, and that his mission was to establish a firm basis for unity throughout the world, and inaugurate an age of peace and justice, which Bahá'ís expect will inevitably arise.&lt;ref name=&quot;esslemont&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Esslemont, J.E. |year= 1980 |title= Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era |edition= 5th ed. |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id= ISBN 0877431604 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/je/BNE/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[/Shoghi Effendi|Shoghi Effendi]], the appointed head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of [[/Baha'u'llah|Bahá'u'lláh]]'s teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitab-i-aqdas Kitáb-i-Aqdas]'' constitute the bed-rock of the Bahá'í Faith:
{{cquote|The independent search after truth, unfettered by [[:W:en:Superstition|superstition]] or [[:W:en:Tradition|tradition]]; the oneness of the entire human race, the pivotal principle and fundamental doctrine of the Faith; the basic unity of all religions; the condemnation of all forms of [[:W:en:Prejudice|prejudice]], whether religious, racial, class or national; the harmony which must exist between [[:W:en:Religion|religion]] and [[:W:en:Science|science]]; the equality of men and women, the two wings on which the bird of human kind is able to soar; the introduction of compulsory education; the adoption of a [[:W:en:Bahá'í Faith and auxiliary language|universal auxiliary language]]; the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty; the institution of a world tribunal for the adjudication of disputes between nations; the exaltation of work, performed in the spirit of service, to the rank of [[:W:en:Worship|worship]]; the glorification of justice as the ruling principle in human society, and of religion as a bulwark for the protection of all peoples and nations; and the establishment of a permanent and universal peace as the supreme goal of all mankind—these stand out as the essential elements [which Bahá'u'lláh proclaimed].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id=ISBN 0877430209 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-20.html#gr7 | pages=pp. 281}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <comment>Changed spelling from 'fatHa' to 'fatḥah'; the latter spelling is how it is spelt on the relevant Wikipedia page.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We have learnt about some Arabic letters so far, and have been transliterating using only consonants.  In this lesson, we will learn about the Arabic ''fatḥah'': what it looks like, its purpose, its usage and its sound.

==What it looks like==
The ''fatḥah'' resembles an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent acute accent] such as a French ''accent aigu'' or an Irish ''fada''; sometimes horizontal but usually slanted, it is a line over a letter.  

A ''fatḥah'' is never vertical or beneath a letter.

==Its purpose==
The ''fatḥah'' indicates a short vowel sound, pronounced with the letter on which it is written. 

Example of what is meant by ''pronounced with'': with كَ (''ka''), the ''a'' is pronounced right after the ''k''.  The ''fatḥah'' represents the sound of the ''a''.

==Its Usage==
The ''fatḥah'' is a short vowel [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic diacritic]; its main use is to ensure a reader pronounces unfamiliar words correctly.  

In most books and newspapers the ''fatḥah'' (as with the other Arabic short vowels) is not written; the reader is expected to be able to know the word and its meaning from its context within a sentence.

==Sound==
it makes the short &quot;a&quot; sound.

What is meant by &quot;the short &quot;a&quot; sound&quot;.
It is meant that it is pronounced for a shorter amount of time. Make sure you don't pronounce it &quot;aa&quot;.  And make sure you don't pronounce it so that it rhymes with &quot;bay&quot; or &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;say&quot;.  Pronounce it so it rhymes with &quot;umbrella&quot;.


If you see a ''fatḥah'' on a letter pronounce the ''fatḥah'' sound right after the letter.
kaaf +fatHa = &quot;ka&quot;


*&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;َك + َ = ك  &lt;/font&gt;

Go over all letters you are familiar with.  Draw each one.  Add a ''fatḥah''.  Instead of pronouncing the letter's name, pronounce it with the ''fatḥah'' (example: instead of &quot;kaaf&quot;, say &quot;ka&quot;).

Perhaps renaming it and adding how to make the dough would help, but it almost looks like a manual for a 'subway' type bakers. I second your decision anyway.

:I've updated this page extensively in order to address these concerns. I left in the bits about shaping the dough and the proofer method of cooking, but made them less of a focus in the article. [[User:Wikidsoup|Wikidsoup]] ([[User talk:Wikidsoup|talk]]) 20:40, 10 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

{{vegetable}} | [[Cookbook:Legumes|Legumes]]

'''Chickpeas''' are legumes used in the cuisines of [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asia]],  [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|the Middle East]], and the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]]. They provide high-quality [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]] and [[Cookbook:Protein|protein]], are recommended for [[Cookbook:Low-GI Diet|diabetics]], and are credited by some as the key to development of human civilization through agriculture.

There are two main types:

* '''Kabuli''' - '''European chickpeas''', '''ceci''', or '''garbanzo beans''', are large, white chickpeas that are much used throughout southern Europe and the Middle East, but are also used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cuisine]] for making dahls. These chickpeas are used interchangeably with [[Cookbook:Fava Bean|fava beans]] for making [[Cookbook:Falafel|falafel]] and [[Cookbook:Hummus|hoummus]] (hoummus means chickpea in Arabic). Chickpeas are ground finely to make [[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|chickpea flour]].
* '''Desi''' - '''Bengal gram''', '''chana''', boont'''([[w:Magahi language|Bihar]]), or '''kadalai''' ([[w:Tamil language|Tamil]]), are much more common in South Asian cuisine. Grinding raw chana to flour makes [[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|besan]] or ''gram flour'' whereas ground roasted chana makes Sattu'''. Sattu is the main filler of LITTI''', a famous cuisine of Bihar.

'''Chana dal''' or '''channa dhal''' are split, usually also hulled (skinless) chickpeas used in [[Cookbook:Dal|dals]]. The term nearly always refers to the Desi, but sometimes also to the Kabuli - usually though, Kabuli dal are called ''Kabuli chana dal''. In Tamil, chana dal is called ''kadalai parrappu''. They are often cooked with a pinch of [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|asafoetida]] to make them more easy to digest.

== Cooking Dried Chickpeas ==

Dried chickpeas are fairly easy to prepare, if you allow enough time.  They taste far better than the canned version.  Dried chickpeas expand to at least twice their volume when cooked. 

# Soak the chickpeas overnight in water.  The next day they are ready to cook. 
# Chop 2 stalks of celery for every cup of chickpeas (a cup is approximately a large handful) and put the drained chickpeas and celery into a pot.  The chickpeas will continue to expand, so you should not fill the pot more than half full of the bean and celery mixture. 
# Add water until the chickpeas are covered. 
# Cook on medium for 2 hours.  The cooking time is not an exact science; you will need to bite into a chickpea to see if it is fully cooked.
# Once the chickpeas are done, drain the cooking liquid.  (Incidentally, the cooking liquid from chickpeas makes a wonderful stock.)
# You can season with salt, pepper, and a dash of olive oil and vinegar if you would like to eat them plain, or they can be used in other recipes calling for canned chickpeas.

=== Cooking Chickpeas with a Pressure Cooker ===

If you have a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]], you can reduce the cooking time substantially.

Well-soaked chickpeas with enough water to cover them will cook to perfection at 15psi in 9 minutes, plus about 10 minutes to depressurise. 

Dried chickpeas can also be cooked directly in a pressure cooker.  Add approximately 3 times as much water as chickpeas, and add a small amount (~10-20ml) of oil to reduce foaming.  Cooking time is 40 to 50 minutes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hanging Gardens ==

While the historical validity of the Hanging Gardens may be questioned, I think taking out a sentence that discusses this concept to be out of line, particularly without some sort of discussion.  Clearly this module needs some work, but the Hanging Gardens are a cultural icon that has survived throughout the ages and is something that a typical person with a little bit of knowledge of ancient history will be familiar with.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:12, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

:Any mention of them should include a mention of the question of if they existed.[[User:Geni|Geni]] 01:12, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

== Great job! ==

This is a great module. It seems almost complete, but it has headings with no writing for them. Thanks for contributing this module to Wikibooks and most importantly to Wikijunior. [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 02:00, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

== Report after viewing this article ==
=== Coverage ===
The hanging gardens (mentioned above) should be included. My reason, though, is not the same -- it's because it's been listed at one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The existence question and the location question should be included, though briefly; we don't want to puzzle our young readers.

Also needs an introduction, as stated above.
=== Accuracy ===
As far as I know, the things are quite accurate, but I don't know everything in here so I can't be sure that the whole thing is accurate.
=== Grammar and tone ===
Perfect. I like this one.

This module is quite good were it not for the lack of an introduction. I like it.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: arabic → Arabic (2), pronounciation → pronunciation using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">alif is a very common Arabic letter. When it comes after a letter it causes the long &quot;aa&quot; sound. When it comes at the beginning of a word it means the word starts with a vowel sound.


Basic Appearance
alif looks like a vertical line. It is drawn from the top down. example:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ا&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is called a plain alif, because it carries no symbols.


alif can also carry a hamza. The hamza is drawn after the alif. It looks like so:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;أ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When it makes the &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; sound.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;إ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When it makes the &quot;i&quot; sound (the &quot;i&quot; sound in &quot;bit&quot; not &quot;bite&quot;).



When a plain alif comes after a letter. like so:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;ب + ا&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;بـ ـا&lt;/font&gt; Putting it together&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;با&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It makes a long &quot;aa&quot; sound come after it. In the previous example the Arabic letter ب (baa) was followed by a plain alif. So it was read as &quot;baa&quot;, remember a long &quot;aa&quot; sound, not a short one.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;يا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: yaa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;فا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: faa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;وا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: waa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;دا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: daa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;با&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: baa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;تا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: taa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;كا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: kaa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;ما&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: maa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The first letter can also be written with a fatHa and the pronunciation does not change.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;يَا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: yaa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;فَا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: faa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But if the alif is not a plain alif, then the long &quot;aa&quot; sound is not made. Something special happens, the purpose of hamza will be covered later.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;يَأ&lt;/font&gt; (NOT pronounced: yaa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;فإ&lt;/font&gt; (NOT pronounced: faa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Do not forget that the long &quot;aa&quot; sound is only made with a plain alif. If you see an alif with anything on it, it will not make the &quot;aa&quot; sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Dammah. 


==Appearance==
It looks like a loop, or a comma on top of a letter. It always goes on a letter. It is always above a letter never under it. Some examples:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;  بُ &lt;/font&gt; a baa with a Dammah (pronounced:bu)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; فُ &lt;/font&gt; a faa with a Dammah (pronounced: fu)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يُ&lt;/font&gt; a yaa with a Dammah (pronounced: yu)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; رُ&lt;/font&gt;  a raa with a Dammah (pronounced: ru)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


==Sound==
It makes a short &quot;u&quot; sound after the letter. This &quot;u&quot; sound must not be pronounced like the letter &quot;u&quot; in English. It is the &quot;oo&quot; sound in &quot;root&quot; pronounced for less time. To non-Arabs it sometimes sounds like an &quot;o&quot; sound, this is because the &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; sound are the same sound in Arabic.

More examples:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; رُنُ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: ru-nu)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـُبُكُ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tu-bu-ku)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; كُكُ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: ku-ku)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يُيُ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yu-yu)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; مُيُكُتُ&lt;/font&gt;   (pronounced: mu-yu-ku-tu)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=Use=
To make a &quot;u&quot; sound right after a letter.

=Waaw=
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;و&lt;/font&gt;
(waaw)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

waaw's main use is to make the &quot;w&quot; sound.
example:
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; وِ&lt;/font&gt;  a waaw with a kasra (pronounced: wi) Note that the kasra should be underneath the letter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; وَ&lt;/font&gt;  a waaw with a fatHa (pronounced: wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; وُ&lt;/font&gt;  a waaw with a Dammah (pronounced: wu)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; وَتَ&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: wa-ta)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; فـَوَ&lt;/font&gt;   (pronounced: fa-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يَوَ&lt;/font&gt;   (pronounced: ya-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==ـُو  (&quot;oo&quot; sound)==
But It is not that simple. There is also another use.

If the letter waaw is plain (no symbols on it) and the letter before it carries a Dammah then the &quot;oo&quot; sound is made, like the one in &quot;food&quot; and &quot;loot&quot;. This &quot;oo&quot; sound is just the long version of the sound the Dammah makes. It lasts longer than the sound a Dammah makes.
Examples&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; بُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: boo )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: too)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; فـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: foo)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; مُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: moo)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; مُوفـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: moo-foo)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; كُوكُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: koo-koo)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Remember the waaw has to have nothing on it to make the &quot;oo&quot; sound. Here are some examples where it doesn't make the &quot;oo&quot; sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َبُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bu-wa )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َتـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tu-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ِفـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: fu-wi)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َمُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: mu-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َمُوفـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: moo-fu-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َكُوكُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: koo-ku-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


The letter before the waaw must have the Dammah on it, in order to make the &quot;oo&quot; sound. Here are some examples where the &quot;oo&quot; sound is not made.

==ْـَو== 
This sounds like the &quot;aw&quot;, Its the sound many English speakers say when they get hurt. We will write it &quot;au&quot; in transliteration. All the following examples are pronounced so that they rhyme with the sound people make when they are hurt.

Examples:

&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;بَو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bau )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـَوْ&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: tau)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; فـَوْ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: fau)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;مَوْ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: mau)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; مُوفـَوْ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: moo-fau)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; كُوكَوْ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: koo-kau)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <comment>/* kasra and yaa */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==kasra==

===Appearance===
It is a line that goes on the bottom of a letter. It looks exactly like a fatHa, but it goes under the letter. It always exists with a letter, it cannot be alone.

&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; بِ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: be )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;كِ &lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: ki )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; هِيَ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: hi-ya  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تِـتـِتِ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced:ti-ti-ti  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Sound===
It makes the &quot;i&quot; sound in bit. It never makes the &quot;i&quot; sound in &quot;I&quot;. It sounds like the &quot;ee&quot; in &quot;beet&quot; pronounced very shortly. It is a short vowel.


==kasra and yaa==


&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced:ee  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If a plain (with no symbols on it) ي (yaa) comes after a kasra, then the &quot;ee&quot; sound is made. This &quot;ee&quot; sound is exactly the same sound as the &quot;ee&quot; sound in &quot;feet&quot;. It is a long vowel sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; بـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; كِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: kee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; هِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: hee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ثِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: ''th''ee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;ثِـيتِي &lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced:''th''ee-tee  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The same sound would be made if the &quot;yaa&quot; had something called a sukoon on it (this will be covered later).Examples:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ْبـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ْكِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: kee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

BUT if the yaa has anything else on it then it will not make the &quot;ee&quot; sound.

&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َبـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bi-ya )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ُكِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: ki-yu )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ِبـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bi-yi )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ثِـيُرَ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced:thi-yu-ra  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==More difficult examples==

&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yee  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yoo )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;وِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: wee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يُوَ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yu-wa )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يا&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yaa )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

So what if we want to write the &quot;a&quot; sound in &quot;fate&quot;. The fatHa alone will not do that job. In reality the &quot;a&quot; sound in fate, includes a &quot;y&quot; sound in it. So a fatHa followed by a yaa with no vowel on it will make the &quot;a&quot; sound in &quot;fate&quot;. We transliterate this with &quot;ai&quot;. 
Examples:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;كَي &lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: kai ) Sounds exactly like the letter &quot;k&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tai )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; وَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: wai ) Sounds exactly like the word &quot;way&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; مَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: mai ) Sounds exactly like the word &quot;may&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; سَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: sai ) Sounds exactly like the word &quot;say&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


==More examples==
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;مَيْكَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: mai-kai ) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـَيْرَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tai-rai )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;يَي &lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yai ) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;يـِي &lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yee ) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tai )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <comment>/* Exercises */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A popular but less known method of bodybuilding is using solely your body weight to build muscle. This method has advantages in the fact that the exercises are more natural movements, and are less concentrated on individual muscles, which lowers the risk of muscle imbalance and injury. Many athletes use primarily body weight training.

==Exercises==

===Push-ups===
Push-ups are a well known and effective exercises that is easy to learn and very efficient. Primarily  building the pecs and triceps, push-ups also build shoulder-muscle as well as helping to develop a stronger core.

To execute a push-up, lie face-down on the ground with your legs together and your hands pressed flat-palmed against the ground just wider than shoulder-width apart, parallel to your neck. Keeping your body rigid, slowly push up with your arms until they are almost fully extended, with your feet at a ninety-degree angle with your legs, and your toes bend against the ground supporting your legs. Hold for a second at the top, then slowly lower yourself back down, making sure to keep a straight core, until your nose is just above the floor. Repeat reps as able. It is recommended to do three sets of push-ups to maximum repetition every workout. Also, for a more thorough workout change your grip on the ground to thumb and forefinger of each hand touching, just below your chest, and also hands spread wide out on either side. These three grips will allow more thorough muscle development.

If a regular push-up is too challenging, there are variants to make it easier. Firstly, use your knees as a pivot instead of your feet, just rest your knees on the ground instead. If this is still hard to keep good form, use something such as stairs to create an incline so that its easier to complete.

Most bodybuilders do not use push-ups to develop these muscles, as they can do so many; it is more of an endurance workout than a muscle building workout. True muscle building workouts involved sets with a very maximum of 12 reps, and it's usually less than 8 reps. To make the workout more of a challenge, one can use high objects to rest ones feet on, to make the body more of a vertical angle to increase the resistance. Over time, a bodybuilder could work to a vertical position, completing handstands.

===Pull-Ups, Chin-Ups===

Another excellent upper-body workout are pull-ups and chin-ups. Chin ups are when you hold onto a bar, with both palms facing you, then lowering to extension, then lifting until your chin is higher than the bar. These exercises primarily strengthen the latissimus dorsi, but help to tighten arms (biceps) as well. 

To perform, it is recommended that you have a round bar at just over head-height, possibly suspended in a door-way. These pull-up bars are cheap, easy to install, and most definitely a must have. If for some reason you do not have access to a bar, use the top of a door-frame, throwing a folded towel over the top to pad the grip for your hands. Assuming you have a bar, grab the bar with both hands, shoulder-width apart, and your palms facing either away from you or towards you (perform more reps of whichever grip you are weaker at by doing this grip first, but make sure to do both ways for good muscle balance). Then, letting all of your weight hang from your arms, pull yourself up until your chin is above the bar, then lower so that you are still hanging off of the ground. Perform reps until fatigue, and three sets of maximum repetition is also recommended per workout.

Most gyms have pull-up bars, as well as machines that work the latissimus dorsi, and many bodybuilders simply work this muscle group at the gym. When regular chin-ups and pull-ups become too easy, many add weight by simply holding dumbbells between their legs or using weight belts.

===Squats===
A very simple, yet powerful exercise is the squat. Many athletes add weight to this activity when the form they use isn't good and doesn't develop leg muscles properly. Most people would benefit from not using weights initially.

To complete a full squat, place your feet approximately shoulder width apart (a good method is jumping and landing, this is close enough) then lower your body slowly to the ground, while keeping your feet flat, until you're resting on your feet for balance. There are different depths to lower to, but a full range develops all the muscles equally. To increase difficulty, either add weight or attempt a one legged squat, &quot;pistols&quot;.

==Basic Muscle Groups==
The basic muscle groups that body builders normally train can be classified as upper-body muscles and lower-body muscles

===Upper Body===
The important upper body muscles are Shoulders, Chest (Pectorals), Biceps, Triceps, Lattismus Dorsi and Trapezius.

Some of the common exercises used for these muscle groups are

Shoulders - Military press
Chest - Bench press
Latissmus Dorsi - Lat Pull
Biceps - Barbell curl
Triceps - T-Rod 

Military press and Bench press can be done with either barbell or dumbbells

===Lower Body===
The important muscle groups are Gluteals, Hamstrings, Quadriceps, Hip Flexors, Gastrocnemius, Soleus, Tibial Anterior

Some common exercise are 
Hamstring, Glutes, Quadriceps, Calves  - Squats (will target different muscle groups depending on stance), Deadlifts.

Squats can be done with either body weight, barbell, dumbbell, kettlebells, Smiths machine and a lever system.

There are many variations of the squat such as front squats, back squats, box squats, cambered bar squats, jump squats, one legged squats (a.k.a. &quot;pistols&quot;) etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why Learn C?==

Isn't Latin more like assembly in that regard?

:Hmm, Latin is more like a hybrid between REBOL/APL with a COBOL-like syntax influenced by FORTH... or just not comparable. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] ([[User talk:Rursus|talk]]) 18:18, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

==Too much religion!==
Section: '''Why C, and not Java or Basic or Perl?''' answers:
:''Mostly because of memory allocation.''
This is a religious answer, and as such an effort of faith. The '''true''' answer is instead:
:''Learn all of them! If you need full control of memory allocation, then C is one of the better suited languages - along C++ and Objective-C''.
[[User:Rursus|Rursus]] ([[User talk:Rursus|talk]]) 18:01, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

:And, regarding C++: when parallel programming, the ill defined virtual class tables of C++ poses problems that makes object initialization troublesome in a subprocess. Therefore, C++ is either to be avoided in parallel systems, or a hard discipline of locking parallel processes must be taken. C is in this context more effective, which may explain why few, if any, operating systems are written in C++. (Then probably some Windows versions (but who knows (and who cares about MS anyway?))).

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: symetries → symmetries (2) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Stephen Wolfram was one of the first to focus on the complete set of CA rules. He observed all the rules that can be created using binary cells &lt;math&gt;k=2&lt;/math&gt; and a three cell neighborhood &lt;math&gt;m=2&lt;/math&gt;. There are &lt;math&gt;k^{k^m}=2^{2^3}=256&lt;/math&gt; such rules. The number of rules grows exponentially with the number of cell states and even faster with the neighbourhood size. This vast number of rules is a limiting factor when observing the whole set of rules.



== Definiton of equivalence ==

In this definition a more formal name for rule is used, the local definition function.

The local definition function &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the local definition function &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt;, if and ony if there exists a homomorfism &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of global CA states that 

:&lt;math&gt;f_1  f_2&lt;/math&gt;

== Clustering rules ==

or different symmetries
# input complement
# output complement
# reflection symmetry
# rotation smetry (2D) ?can be produced by reflection no it can not
# equivalence class

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following works for all letters {Huroof}, in all forms.

* Pronounce the 'i' as [ɪ] (in English this is the 'i' in 'bit', not the 'i' in 'bite').
* Pronounce the 'u' as [u] (a 'short' 'oo' sound&lt;ref&gt;It's not really short at all, it's just not glided. In standard English the lips are tightened at the end of this sound. This is not done in Arabic.&lt;/ref&gt;).
* Pronounce the 'a' as [a] (this sound does not exist in standard English. It falls somewhere between the 'a' in 'cat' and the 'o' in 'dog'. It is the same as the normal French 'a', as in the word 'ami' &quot;friend&quot;).

      <comment>/* Pronunciation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''tanween'' is an &quot;n&quot; sound added to the '''end''' of the word in certain circumstances, usually it functions just like the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot; in English, indicating an indefinite article. The word ''tanween,'' literally means marginalize/pushing aside;&lt;ref&gt;See Leviticus chapter 20 &quot;ye shall not marginalize (tanween) the stranger amoung you; For you were strangers in the land of Egypt&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; But usually translated as &quot;nunation&quot;, &quot;to 'n'&quot;, or &quot;'n'ing&quot;; making an &quot;n&quot; sound.

''Tanween'' is indicated by doubling the short vowel at the end of the word. If a word ends with a &quot;kasra&quot; tashkeel, then the ''tanween'' is indicated by writing two &quot;kasra&quot;s (one above the other); same with the &quot;dhamma&quot;, you write ''two dhammas'', one beside the other. However, with the &quot;fatHa&quot;, you don't only double the &quot;fatHa&quot;, but you also add an &quot;Alif&quot; and put the double &quot;fatHa&quot;s on the &quot;alif&quot;. (remember, &quot;Alif&quot; is the first letter in the Arabic alphabet).
So, we can say there are three types of tanween:
* fatHa ''tanween''.
* kasra ''tanween''.
* dhamma ''tanween''.

==Pronunciation==

'''fatHa tanween: '''
The fatHa ''tanween'' is pronounced &quot;en&quot;, as in &quot;then&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;men&quot;, etc. Even though many native Arabic speakers would use &quot;an&quot; to indicate it, since &quot;a&quot; maps to the &quot;aaaa&quot; sound, &quot;en&quot; is probably more accurate.

'''kasra tanween: '''
The kasra tanween is pronounced &quot;in&quot;, as in &quot;in&quot;, &quot;sin&quot;, &quot;fin&quot;, &quot;min&quot;, etc.
Again, some native Arabic speakers might indicate a kasra ''tanween'' with an &quot;en&quot;, thinking that &quot;e&quot; sounds like the Arabic &quot;yaa&quot; letter (&quot;ii&quot; vowel). This is a mistake that stems from not knowing how native English speakers pronounce the &quot;e&quot; sound.

'''dhamma tanween: '''
The dhamma ''tanween'' is pronounced as a short &quot;oo&quot; followed by an &quot;n&quot;. This sounds like the short &quot;un&quot; in &quot;uno&quot; as pronounced in Spanish, not like the long &quot;oon&quot; in &quot;soon&quot;.

'''tanween at the end of a sentence: '''
If the ''tanween'' is the last thing in the sentence, it's not pronounced. In the case of a fatHa-tanween, the alif is pronounced as a long vowel.

The following pronunciation guide for the case where the tanween falls at the end of a sentence works for all letters in all forms.

&lt;table border=1&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+6&quot;&gt;
 ٍب
&lt;/font&gt;(binn)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+6&quot;&gt;
 بً
&lt;/font&gt;(bann)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+6&quot;&gt;
 تٍ
&lt;/font&gt;(tinn)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+6&quot;&gt;
 تٌ
&lt;/font&gt;(tunn)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+6&quot;&gt;
 تً
&lt;/font&gt;(tann)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+6&quot;&gt;
 ثٍ
&lt;/font&gt;(thinn)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
 
 ثٌ
&lt;/font&gt;(thunn)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
ثً
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/font&gt;(thann)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+6&quot;&gt;
 سٍ
&lt;/font&gt;(sinn)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+6&quot;&gt;
 سٌ
&lt;/font&gt;(sunn)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+6&quot;&gt;
 سً
&lt;/font&gt;(sann)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

''Technically, &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;سً &lt;/font&gt; should be written as &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt; ساً&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;سًا&lt;/font&gt;.''
''And &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;بً&lt;/font&gt; should be written as &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;باً&lt;/font&gt; OR &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;بًا&lt;/font&gt;. This is due to stopping (waqf) pronounciation, and spelling rules. Any letter except for &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ء&lt;/font&gt; (hamza) and &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ة&lt;/font&gt; (taa marbooTah), always ends in an alif when it ends in fatHataan (&quot;fatHataan&quot; means &quot;two fatHas&quot;).''
&lt;!--Cell template&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+5&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;()&lt;/td&gt;--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;So, you want to create a low budget action film,&quot;?? Why does this article assume I want to make an action film? I don't see anything in the book title or section title that says &quot;''Action'' Movie Making&quot;...

: Good point.  Go ahead and edit it.  Perhaps you could add a section on writing non-action movies?  [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 10:18, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Early Origins Of Hip Hop ==

The roots of hip hop are in West African and African-American music. The griots of West Africa are a group of traveling singers and poets, whose musical style is reminiscent of hip hop. True hip hop arose during the 1970s when block parties became common in New York City, especially the Bronx. Block parties were usually accompanied by music, especially funk and soul music. The early DJs at block parties began isolating the percussion breaks to hit songs, realizing that these were the most dance-able and entertaining parts; this technique was then common in Jamaica (see dub music) and had spread via the substantial Jamaican immigrant community in New York City, especially the godfather of hip hop, DJ Kool Herc. Dub had arose in Jamaica due to the influence of American sailors and radio stations playing R&amp;B. 
DJ Kool Herc
 

Large sound systems were set up to accommodate poor Jamaicans, who couldn't afford to buy records, and dub developed at the sound systems (refers to both the system and the parties that evolved around them). Herc was one of the most popular DJs in early 70s New York, and he quickly switched from using reggae records to funk, rock and, later, disco, since the New York audience did not particularly like reggae. Because the percussive breaks were generally short, Herc and other DJs began extending them using an audio mixer and two records. Mixing and scratching techniques eventually developed along with the breaks. As in dub, performers began speaking while the music played; these were originally called MCs; Herc focused primarily on DJing, and began working with two MCs, Coke La Rock and Clark Kent -- this was the first emcee crew, Kool Herc &amp; the Herculoids.

== Identifying Rap Music ==

The music at which 1 can have its own views without any sorts of the preoccupied thoughts, that creates your true identification of your hip-hop talent, this can be done with only full concenteration of your views related to your life, to your destiny, to your integrity, to your problems, to your love, to your sexual life as well.


===What Is Rap?===
 
Hip hop and Rap are often used as a general name for the whole genre, however whilst they are inextricably linked, it is important to distinguish between the two and acknowledge the differences.  
          
Historically, rap music comes from hip-hop culture. The roots of rap music trace back to the Jamaican ska era of the mid-60s. MCs rapping over party music made its way to New York a decade later, thanks to DJ Kool Herc, a man many crown the &quot;Father of Hip Hop.&quot; Kool Herc migrated from Jamaica to New York in 1967 and helped give birth to the hip-hop culture that would continue to thrive and spread.

The Hip Hop Network notes that while the Sugar Hill Gang's 1979 &quot;Rapper's Delight&quot; was the first breakthrough rap hit, it emerged from a &quot;an inner-city phenomenon centering on DJs and including equal proportions of break dancing, MCing, and graffiti art.&quot; 

More recently, &quot;rap&quot; has been used to describe the aggressive, mass-market produced music of Nas or Eminem. But, as one online encyclopedia points out, &quot;Not all music that has rapping in it, however, is actually rap music, and not all hip-hop music has rapping in it.&quot; Artists like Jurassic 5 and De La Soul typify hip-hop music, which is generally more multi-instrumented and less in-your-face. 

Rap and hip-hop music is now a huge industry, and it has the diversity of a huge industry. Now respected as an established form of music, and many see it as one of the most versatile and original, from Producers/DJs/MCs such as Madlib, crossing Jazz, Blues and other musical styles to influence his work to Dr. Dre producing such commercial names as Eminem and 50 Cent, representing the more 'Rap' commercial style.

*Underground

===Regional Categories===

'''West Coast Hip Hop'''

West Coast hip hop, also known as California hip hop or West Coast rap, is a style of hip hop music that originated in California in the 1980s. It has since grown into a subgenre of hip hop and has developed several creative centers, most of which are in California.

These centers are: The greater Los Angeles area, Long Beach, the greater San Francisco area (also known as the &quot;Bay&quot; Area ), Oakland/Berkeley, Vallejo, Sacramento/Davis, and Seattle.

'''East Coast hip hop'''

East Coast hip hop (sometimes also referred to as New York hip hop) is a style of hip hop music that originated in New York City during the late-1970s. East Coast hip hop emerged as a definitive subgenre after artists from other regions of the United States, chiefly the West Coast and the South, emerged with different styles of hip hop. It has since grown into a major sub-genre of hip hop, and has played an instrumental role in hip hop history. East Coast hip hop has developed several creative epicenters and local scenes within the Northeastern United States, most of which are primarily located within African-American and Hispanic urban centers.

'''South hip hop'''

Hip hop in the South (sometimes referred to as the dirty South) is a style of hip hop music that has multiple origins in Houston, Miami, Atlanta and Memphis.  Hip hop in the South emerged during the late 1980's and early 1990's.  This regional hip hop has developed into multiple musical sounds like crunk, bounce, snap, chopped &amp; screwed and booty-bass.  Even though initially thought of as unsophisticated and simple, recent success in this region has seen a domination in 2005 of the weekly Top 10 songs in the country and an 2005 '''Academy award''' for Three 6 Mafia [http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1149254697866], a Tennessee-based rap group.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Laam-alif is a ligature. When a ل (laam) comes before an ا (alif) in a word, they automatically come together and form laam-alif. Laam-alif is not a letter, It is how the two letters, laam and then alif are written together.

This could be expanded. See my article [http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=10766 LaTeX isn't for everyone but it could be for you] --[[User:Andyr|Andyr]] 21:45, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

I cannot seem to find instructions on how to put tabs (for paragraphs) in the text.

I removed this line, because there is no difference WYSIWYG editing is available on all platforms as well

* It is available (and transportable) across many platforms (Windows, Mac, [[Unix]] and [[Linux]] are all supported).

Err.. Tex a programming language? Imo it's just a markup language, like html, not programming.

: It's a programming language aimed to typesetting, but you could (theoretically) use it for anything. PostScript is made with the same approach. You can use if-else constructs and there are packages to make dynamic calculations (that are performed while compiling). I'll point this out clearly in the main page. [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 11:19, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

:: Why '''low-level''' programming language? That sounds like some kind of assembly language.

:::if you are considering a typesetting system, then it's definitely a low-level programming language, because you have to tell the compiler where any object has to be placed, its size, etc. I can't imagine anything lower than this. In any case, it's the &quot;lowest&quot; approach I know for typesetting. [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 19:23, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

Hi I noticed that tetex is given as a suggested LaTeX distribution for Unix, but it's currently deprecated, and TeXLive is supposed to be used instead.

== dvipdf and dvipdfm ==

I don't know the difference between ''dvipdf'' and ''dvipdfm'', but when I have used them in the past I always got better output with ''dvipdfm''. I have looked for info on internet, and it looks like it's not just a case, see for example http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/bit/compintro/tips.html , LaTeX section point 8. In the article, at the beginning I just wrote ''dvipdfm'' because I knew it is better, so I didn't want to write about two different tools doing the same thing, when we are sure that one always works better than the other. Is this true? is ''dvipdfm'' a good replacement of ''dvipdf'' in any case? [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 22:28, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

Actually, dvipdfmx is the dvi-to-pdf program that is currently maintained.  it has additional support for cjk, among other things.  dvipdf and dvipdfm are unmaintained and there is no reason to use them.  --karl@tug.org

== Section &quot;Skills needed&quot; ==

I have removed the section &quot;Skills needed&quot;, added to the bulk of the chapter later. It contained such incomprehensible claims as: 
# LaTeX is &quot;very easy&quot; to learn.
# &quot;Familiarity with publishing process is useful.&quot; From what I understand, learning LaTeX has little to do with publishing process.

I am acting on the assumption that the purpose of this book is to make the user use LaTeX effectively, finding quickly how to perform various tasks and solve problems.

== Discrepency of definition ==

I would like to point out a point of confusion I came across as a new user of LaTeX hoping to benefit from this page. During the discussion of installation, first the instructions advise us to download one of the three platform-specific TeX distributions. Later in the discussion, we are told that our &quot;LaTeX distribution&quot; will contain such and such things. But what is a LaTeX distribution? Is it included in the TeX distribution we were advised to download? Where is the discussion on this? This creates confusion, and should be clarified someone who is able to do so. Thanks.

: I've added some details on the different terms. Sadly I fear it will reamin confuse until you actually install and use the whole stuff. The concept is not easy to understand, we cannot do anything about it. If someone feels like he/she can provide a better explanation, feel free to contribute. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 18:30, 31 January 2013 (UTC)

==Re-written first paragraph==

The first paragraph of this page is badly focused, jumping between pronunciation and history, and professional/casual tone. The sentence structure is valid, but the author uses word constructs which are somewhat awkward to English speakers. I have cleaned it up significantly.--[[User:Steelangel|Steelangel]] ([[User talk:Steelangel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Steelangel|contribs]]) 01:34, 1 February 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= OpenOffice =
Use the following functions of the word processing program:
== Mail Merge==
Type and print a letter to at least five different people using the same text, but personalizing each letter with the addressee's name appearing at least three times.

The best instructions for doing this can be found in the Help pages of OpenOffice itself.  Knowing that the function is called &quot;mail merge&quot; is the key to finding the right help page.

== Right Justify ==
Using the mouse, highlight the text you wish to right justify.  Then click on the Format tab and select &quot;Paragraph.&quot;  Then click on the &quot;Alignment&quot; tab, check the box labelled &quot;Right,&quot; and click on &quot;OK&quot;.

== Center Title ==
This operation is identical to the &quot;Right Justify&quot; operation, except that instead of checking the &quot;Right&quot; box, check the &quot;Justify&quot; and select &quot;Center&quot; from the pull down menu.

== Change margins and page length ==
Click on &quot;Format&quot; and select &quot;Page.&quot;  Then click on the &quot;Page&quot; tab.  This will bring up a window that will allow you to set the margins (left, right, top, and bottom) as well as the page dimensions.

== Move paragraph ==
Using the mouse, highlight the paragraph.  Then type &lt;ctrl&gt;X to delete the paragraph.  Move the mouse cursor to the paragraph's new location and type &lt;ctrl&gt;V.

== Save ==
Type &lt;ctrl&gt;S or select Save (or Save As) from the File menu.

== Copy and Paste ==
This is almost exactly the same as moving a paragraph, the only difference being that once the paragraph is highlighted you press &lt;ctrl&gt;C instead of &lt;ctrl&gt;X.  This will put the highlighted text in the paste buffer, but it will not delete it from the document.  It can then be pasted into a different place by typing &lt;ctrl&gt;V.

The number ten is not .l, but 1., since numbers are written from left to right, unlike normal words.

Also, drawing guides would be nice. Illustrations that show the direction and order of the strokes.--[[User:66.157.116.9|66.157.116.9]] 21:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

I find this strange (added 1 April 2006 by TwoThirty):
  &quot;Arabic numerals (how the numbers look) are of two
   types, the one's used in North America, and the one's
   not used in North America.&quot;
(&quot;Nort America&quot;:)
This loosely implies South America and Europe would
use non-European &quot;arabic&quot; numbers. On the other hand,
replacing it with &quot;Europe&quot; would imply the same about
North and South America (and most parts of Africa, etc). 
(&quot;two types&quot;:) There seems to be at least three types.
The paragraph is difficult to reformulate. 
Maybe just remove it. The table says it all.

      <comment>/* Bonds */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Overview of bonding|next=Ionic bonds}}

What determines the type of bond formed between two elements? There are two ways of classifying elements to determine the bond formed:  by electronegativity, or by metallic/non-metallic character.  

== Electronegativity ==
Electronegativity is a property of atoms which is reflected in the layout of the periodic table of the elements.  Electronegativity is greatest in the elements in the upper right of the table (e.g., fluorine), and lowest in the lower left (e.g., francium).

{{Wikipedia|Electronegativity}}
''Electronegativity'' is a relative measure of how strongly an atom will attract the electrons in a bond.  Although bonds are the result of atoms sharing their electrons, the electrons can be shared unequally.  The more electronegative atom in a bond will have a slight negative charge, and the less electronegative atom will have a slight positive charge.  Overall, the molecule may have no charge, but the individual atoms will.  This is a result of the electronegativity—by attracting the electrons in a bond, an atom gains a slight negative charge.  Of course, if two elements have equal electronegativity, they will share the electrons equally.
[[Image:Pauling.jpg|thumb|left|Linus Pauling created a commonly-used measure of electronegativity.]]

Metallic elements have low electronegativity, and non-metallic elements have high electronegativity.  If two elements are close to each other on the [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table|periodic table]], they will have similar electronegativities. 

Electronegativity is measured on a variety of scales, the most common being the ''Pauling scale''.  Created by chemist Linus Pauling, it assigns 4.0 to fluorine (the highest) and 0.7 to francium (the lowest).

==Bonds==
'''Non-polar covalent''' bonds occur when there is equal or near-equal sharing of electrons between the two bonded atoms.  This should make sense because covalent bonds are the sharing of electrons between two atoms.  Molecules such as Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are good examples. Typically, a difference in electronegativity between 0.0 and 0.4 indicates a non-polar covalent bond.

'''Polar covalent''' bonds occur when there is unequal sharing of the electrons between the atoms. Molecules such as NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are examples of this. The typical rule is that bonds with an electronegativity difference between 0.5 and 1.7 are considered polar.  The electrons are still being shared between two atoms, but one atom attracts the electrons more than the other.

'''Ionic''' bonds occur when there is complete transfer of the electrons in the bond. This bond does not contain atoms at all, but rather consists of two ions. Substances such as NaCl and MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are examples. Generally, electronegativity differences of 1.8 or greater create ionic bonds.  The electronegativity difference is so great that one atom can attract the electrons enough to &quot;take&quot; them from the other atom.

== Notation ==
When drawing diagrams of bonds, we indicate covalent bonds with a line.  We may write the electronegativity using the symbols &lt;math&gt;\delta +&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta -&lt;/math&gt;.  Look at this example.

&lt;center&gt;Hydrogen fluoride (HF): &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\delta + &amp; &amp; \delta - \\ H &amp; - &amp; F \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The plus goes over the less electronegative atom.  From the above diagram, we can see that the fluorine attracts the electrons in the covalent bond more than the hydrogen does.  Fluorine will have a slight negative charge because of this, and hydrogen will have a slight positive charge.  Overall, hydrogen fluoride is neutral.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Many of Celestia's display characteristics and the databases that it uses can be controlled by modifying its configuration file, ''celestia.cfg''.

More extensive changes and additions to Celestia can be provided using Addons and [[Celestia/Celx Scripting|Celx Scripting]].

== Celestia Configuration File==

''The following information is from the comments in the Celestia Configuration File,'' celestia.cfg. 

This file contains configuration data read by Celestia each time it is run. Many of the items may be changed to suit your specific needs or requirements. PLEASE make a backup copy of this file before you make any changes to it.

To learn more about Celestia, visit the Celestia forums at:  http://www.shatters.net/forum/ or the Celestia web site at: http://www.shatters.net/celestia/

=== Data Files ===

This section contains a list of data files that Celestia uses to load  information about stars, constellations and locations. DO NOT change  these file names or the order in which they are listed, unless you  know exactly what you are doing. Most of these files can be viewed  with a plain text editor. Discussion about their content and formats  can be found on the Celestia forums: http://www.shatters.net/forum/   If you want to load all your stars from .stc files, you can now comment  out the StarDatabase entry.

  BoundariesFile               &quot;data/boundaries.dat&quot;

=== User Interface files ===
Despite their &quot;.cel&quot; file extension, these are not CEL scripts, but  rather data files that populate controls such as menus and dialog  boxes.   

*FavoritesFile  -  This is where Bookmarks data are stored. The file does not exist until  you save a Bookmark from within Celestia. You can view this file with  a plain text editor and if you write CEL scripts, it contains some  useful information.   
*DestinationFile  -  This is the list of Destinations used in the Tour Guide dialog box,  accessed via the Navigation Menu. You can edit this file with a plain  text editor to add your own destinations to the dialog box. The order  in which the items are listed in the file is the order in which they  will be listed in the Tour Guide dialog.   

Cursor    This parameter allows you to select from three cursors, but currently  only in the Windows version of Celestia ...   
* White crosshair (&quot;crosshair&quot;) &gt; default cursor   
* Inverting crosshair (&quot;inverting crosshair&quot;)   
* Standard Windows arrow (&quot;arrow&quot;)   

The inverting crosshair can be a better choice because it's more  visible on bright backgrounds. However, should you decide to try this  cursor, TEST IT CLOSELY. Not all graphics chipsets support an inverting  cursor, which will cause Windows to fall back to software emulation.  The emulated cursor interacts with OpenGL applications in unfortunate  ways, forcing a lot of extra redrawing and cutting by half the frame  rate on a GeForce2-equipped laptop. So, if you change this, check your  FPS rates to make sure you haven't kicked Windows into software  emulation mode. 

  FavoritesFile    &quot;favorites.cel&quot;
  DestinationFile  &quot;guide.cel&quot;
  Cursor           &quot;crosshair&quot;

=== Included CEL script files ===   
The following CEL script files are included in the basic Celestia  distribution. These script files may be viewed and edited with a  plain text editor. They may both be modified or replaced to suit your  specific needs.   InitScript is the CEL script that is automatically run each time  Celestia is started. The default script (start.cel) travels to Io, one  of Jupiter's moons.   DemoScript is the CEL script that is run when you press the &quot;d&quot; key  on your keyboard from within Celestia. The default script (demo.cel)  takes you on a short tour of some interesting places in our solar  system.   To learn more about how to use and write CEL scripts and Lua scripts  in Celestia, please visit the Celestia Scripting forum at:    http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=9 

  InitScript  &quot;start.cel&quot;
  DemoScript  &quot;demo.cel&quot;

=== Extras ===
The 'extras' directory is located under the celestia root directory  and is used for storing third-party add-ons to Celestia. To learn  more about Add-Ons for Celestia, visit the Celestia Add-Ons forum at:  http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=6   You may specify additional add-on directories by adding additional  entries, such as the following example shows:  ExtrasDirectories  [ &quot;extras&quot; &quot;myextras1&quot; &quot;myextras2&quot; ]   To specify absolute paths on windows, you either have to use &quot;/&quot; or   double backslashes to separate path components. Example:   ExtrasDirectories  [ &quot;D:/celestia-extras&quot; ]  or ExtrasDirectories  [ &quot;D:\\celestia-extras&quot; ] 

  ExtrasDirectories  [ &quot;extras&quot; ]

=== Font definitions ===
The following entries define the fonts Celestia will use to display text on the display screen. To view the list of fonts available with your distribution of Celestia, look in the fonts directory located  under the Celestia root directory. The default fonts are UTF-8 compatible in order to display non-English characters.   

*Font:      Used to display all informational text. Default: &quot;sans12.txf&quot;   
*LabelFont: Used to display all label text (objects, locations, etc.). Default &quot;sans12.txf&quot;   
*TitleFont: Used to display object names, messages, and script text. Default &quot;sansbold20.txf&quot; 

  Font       &quot;sans12.txf&quot;
  LabelFont  &quot;sans12.txf&quot;
  TitleFont  &quot;sansbold20.txf&quot;

=== Miscellaneous ===

LogoTexture defines the graphic file to be displayed when Celestia is started. The default filename is &quot;logo.png&quot; 

  LogoTexture  &quot;logo.png&quot;

FaintestVisibleMagnitude defines the lowest magnitude at which a star will be displayed in Celestia. This setting may be adjusted real-time via the '[' and ']' keys in Celestia. The default value is 6.0. 

  FaintestVisibleMagnitude 6.0

RotateAcceleration defines the speed at which an object will be  rotated in Celestia, when using a keypress, such as the left and right arrow keys. A higher value will rotate the object quicker, while a lower value will cause a slower rotation. The default value is 120.0. 

  RotateAcceleration 120.0

MouseRotationSensitivity defines the speed at which an object will be rotated in Celestia, when using the mouse press both mouse-buttons or Ctrl+LeftMouseButton, and move the mouse left or right. A higher value will rotate the object quicker, while a lower value will cause a slower rotation. A value of 0.0 (zero) will disable this particular feature. The default value is 1.0. 

  MouseRotationSensitivity 1.0

=== Scripting ===
The following parameter is used in Lua (.celx) scripting.  ScriptScreenshotDirectory defines the directory where screenshots are to be stored. The default value is &quot;&quot;, i.e. Celestia's installation directory. 

  ScriptScreenshotDirectory &quot;&quot;

CELX-scripts can request permission to perform dangerous operations, such as reading, writing and deleting files or executing external programs. If granted, a malicious script could use this to destroy data or compromise system security.  The following parameter determines what Celestia does upon such  requests: &quot;ask&quot;: ask the user if he wants to allow access (default) &quot;allow&quot;: always allow such requests &quot;deny&quot;: always deny such requests.

  ScriptSystemAccessPolicy &quot;ask&quot;

=== Rendering Resources ===
The following lines are render detail settings.  Assigning higher  values will produce better quality images, but may cause some older  systems to run slower.     OrbitPathSamplePoints defines how many sample points to use when    rendering orbit paths. The default value is 100.     RingSystemSections defines the number of sections used to draw rings around a planet.    The default value is 100.     ShadowTextureSize defines the size* of shadow texture to be used.    The default value is 256. Maximum useful value is 2048.     EclipseTextureSize defines the size* of the eclipse texture to be used.    The default value is 128. Maximum useful value is 1024. The ShadowTextureSize and EclipseTextureSize values should both be powers of two (128, 256, 512, etc.). Using larger values will      reduce the jagged edges of eclipse shadows and shadows on planet  rings, but it will decrease the amount of memory available for  planet textures.  The shadow and eclipse texture settings are not used with the OpenGL 2.0 render path, which uses a different technique to render shadows.

  OrbitPathSamplePoints  100
  RingSystemSections     100
 
  ShadowTextureSize      256
  EclipseTextureSize     128

Set the level of multisample antialiasing.  Not all 3D graphics hardware supports antialiasing, though most newer graphics chipsets do.  Larger values will result in smoother edges with a cost in  rendering speed.  4 is a sensible setting for recent, higher-end  graphics hardware; 2 is probably better mid-range graphics.  The default value is 1, which disables antialiasing.

  AntialiasingSamples        4

The following line is commented out by default.  Celestia enables and disables certain rendering features based on the set of extensions supported by the installed OpenGL driver and 3D graphics hardware.  With IgnoreGLExtensions, you may specify a list of extensions that Celestia will treat as unsupported.  This is useful primarily for the developers of Celestia.

   IgnoreGLExtensions [ &quot;GL_ARB_vertex_program&quot; ]

=== LogSize ===

The number of rows in Celestia's internal debug log. This log is displayable onscreen by pressing the ~ (tilde) key (tilde space on some keyboards). The default log size is 200 lines.

 LogSize 5000

=== Labelled Stars ===
The LabelledStars section defines which stars will have text labels  assigned to them, which are visible when this option is turned on. (This section is '''obsolete''' as of Celestia v1.5.0. Star names are displayed depending on the brightness of the stars.)

  LabelledStars

[[Image:5aday_salad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A typical salad.]]

A '''salad''' is a food item generally served either prior to or after the main dish as a separate course, as a main course in itself, or as a side dish accompanying the main dish. The word “salad” comes from the French ''salade'' of the same meaning, from the Latin ''salata'', “salty.”

A salad is most often composed of a mixture of uncooked [[Cookbook:Vegetable | vegetables]], built up on a base of green leafy vegetables such as one or more [[Cookbook:Lettuce | lettuce]] varieties, [[Cookbook:Dandelions|dandelion]], [[Cookbook:Alfalfa | alfalfa sprouts]], [[Cookbook:Cabbage | cabbage]], [[Cookbook:Spinach | spinach]] or [[Cookbook:Arugula | arugula]] (rocket). This is often referred to as a “green salad.”

Other common vegetables in a green salad include [[Cookbook:Tomato | tomato]], [[Cookbook:Cucumber | cucumber]], [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper | peppers]], [[Cookbook:Mushroom | mushroom]], [[Cookbook:Onion | onion]], [[Cookbook:Spring onion | spring onion]], [[Cookbook:Carrot | carrot]] and [[Cookbook:Radish | radish]]. Other food items such as [[Cookbook:Pasta | pasta]], [[Cookbook:Olive | olive]]s, cooked [[Cookbook:Potato | potato]]es, [[Cookbook:Rice | rice]], [[Cookbook:Croutons|croutons]], [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry | meat and poultry]] (e.g. [[Cookbook:Bacon | bacon]], [[Cookbook:Chicken | chicken]]), [[Cookbook:Cheese | cheese]] or [[Cookbook:Seafood | seafood]] (e.g. [[Cookbook:Tuna | Tuna]],[[Cookbook:Crab | crab]]) are sometimes added to salads.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Journalism is a discipline of collecting, verifying, analyzing and presenting information gathered regarding current events, including trends, issues and people. Those who practice journalism are known as journalists.Journalism is often dangerous but very practical in day today world.

News-oriented journalism often is described as the &quot;first draft of history.&quot; Even though journalists often write news articles to a deadline, news media usually edit and proofread the results prior to publication.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In modern medical science, the use of statistical methods are ubiquitous, insofar as the research builds on quantitative methods. Whether the research question originates in the laboratory, the clinic, or epidemiologic registries, appropriate statistical methods are called for to collect, analyze and interpret the data. The ambition of the present book is to provide an introduction to basic statistical tools, so that it may be used as a companion in a first academic course on statistics for medical students.

The presentation should be as easy to follow as possible while maintaining a sufficient level of rigour. The book will not give insight into all the mathematical background needed to derive the stated results in a formal way, but rather focus on helping the understanding of the student. The exposition will be based on worked examples, with the focus on pedagogical analyses. Ideally, all examples should be taken from relevant and published medical studies, but this needs careful consideration of any copyrights involved. As a simple alternative, suitably simulated data can often be introduced instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Analysis of a single sample ==

Before getting started with the theory, we will consider a simple example. The example will expose the basic components of a statistical analysis and aim to give an intuitive understanding of the type of results that can be obtained from such an analysis.

A naive question on the human body temperature is whether or not, it on average is 37&amp;deg;C? To answer this question a study was done, which measured the temperature on 130 individuals. The data can be downloaded here [http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/datasets/normtemp.dat normtemp.dat] and documentation can be found in ([http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n2/datasets.shoemaker.html Shoemaker, 1996]), and references therein. A brief summary of the data is the following, so-called ''stem-and-leaf'' plot:


  Stem-and-leaf plot for tempC (Body Temperature / Celsius)
  tempC rounded to nearest multiple of .1
  plot in units of .1

  35s | 7
  35. | 899
  36* | 011
  36t | 222222333333
  36f | 444444555
  36s | 66666666666677777777777777
  36. | 888888888888888999999999999
  37* | 0000000000111111111111111111
  37t | 2222222333333
  37f | 44445
  37s | 7
  37. | 8
  38* | 
  38t | 2

This shows, for example, that one person (first from the top) had a body temperature of 35.7&amp;deg;C, another (second from top) had 35.8&amp;deg;C, while two (three and four from the top) had 35.9&amp;deg;C, and so on. Most had temperatures around 36.6&amp;deg;C to 37.3&amp;deg;C.

A very similar graphical presentation of the same data is given in the histogram below:

[[Image:TempC_hist.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Histogram of 130 persons body temperatures.]]

If we want to summarize the data using numbers, two important measures are the ''mean'' and the ''standard deviation'' (SD). For this sample of data, the mean is 36.805&amp;deg;C and the SD is 0.407&amp;deg;C. We will later give a more precise definition of these two ''summary statistics'' but for now we can think of them as giving the central point of the data (the mean) and a measure of the variability of the data around their mean. Graphically, the mean can be thought of as the balancing point of the distribution were the columns of the histogram to have weight identical to their area. The SD can for this kind of data be interpreted as follows: If we take the mean and subtract two times the SD, respectively add two times the SD, then approximately 95% of all the subjects will have body temperatures in this interval.

After this first look at the data, let us return to the question of interest: Is the true average body temperature 37&amp;deg;C? One way of answering this is to turn the question around, and start with assuming that 37&amp;deg;C is actually the true, average temperature. The question then becomes, what would samples of size 130 from such a hypothetical population look like? This can be answered with statistical theory, or &amp;ndash; in this computerized age &amp;ndash; with simulated samples based on random number generation. Specifically, let us assume that this hypothetical population has the distribution of body temperatures shown below:

[[Image:TempC_hypoth.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Distribution of body temperature in a hypothetical population with mean 37&amp;deg;C and an SD of 0.407&amp;deg;C.]]

Imagine that we next draw 1,000 samples, each consisting of 130 individuals. What would their means look like? This is shown here:

[[Image:TempC_samplemean.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Histogram of mean body temperature in 1,000 samples from a hypothetical population with a true mean of 37&amp;deg;C and an SD of 0.407&amp;deg;C.]]

Again we see an approximately bell-shaped histogram. The averages of the samples are centered around 37&amp;deg;C (like the hypothetical distribution was), but with a much smaller spread than before. All of the one thousand averages lie between 36.89&amp;deg;C and 37.10&amp;deg;C. This is the first important observation we can make: The variability of an average is smaller (usually much smaller) than the variability of a single observation. We shall later see, that an explicit formula exists describing this reduction in variability. The second important observation, is that none of the one thousand samples had a mean equal to 36.805&amp;deg;C or less (remember that 36.805&amp;deg;C was the actual mean observed on the &quot;real&quot; individuals). It is thus extremely unlikely to get a sample mean of 36.805&amp;deg;C, had the true average temperature in the population been 37&amp;deg;C. This is what is known as a statistical significant result, which is tecnical jargon for stating that the actually observed data is very different from what would be expected, had the investigated hypothesis (is the true average of body temperatures 37&amp;deg;C?) been true. The answer to our question is thus that while we cannot completely rule that the true average body temperature is 37&amp;deg;, it would be extremely unlikely to observe what we actually did observe, had the true average been 37&amp;deg;. Hence, we conclude that the true average body temperature is not 37&amp;deg;, ie. we reject this hypothesis.

So it was not 37&amp;deg; which is actually not a very informative finding. The far more interesting question is, what the true average body temperature could then be, judged from what we observed in this sample. This is typically answered with a so-called ''confidence interval''. The fundamental rationale behind a confidence interval is to use the data to obtain the best possible (ie. narrow) interval where the true value of a parameter can be expected to be found with a given probability, typically 95%. Formulas for computing the interval depend on type of data and the way they were sampled, but we will defer this to later Chapters and for now concentrate on their interpretation. 

Hence let us again consider the hypothetic population described above with mean 37&amp;deg;C and an SD of 0.407&amp;deg;C.
In the Figure below we see the result of computing 95% confidence intervals for 50 random samples from this hypothetical distribution. Each interval is represented by a dot indicating the mean of the specific sample while the vertical lines indicate the confidence interval computed for the sample.

[[Image:TempC_sampleci.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Fifty 95% confidence intervals based on 50 samples from a hyphypothetical normal distribution with a mean of 37°C and SD of 0.407°C.]]

Note that of the 50 confidence intervals, there are only two which do not contain the true value of 37&amp;deg;C, the true value for this hypothetical population. This matches rather closely with the definition, stating that 95% of such intervals should contain the true value. In other words 5% of the intervals should not contain the true value, which for 50 samples would correspond to 2.5 of the intervals not covering the true value.

For our specific sample based on real observations the 95% confidence interval is (36.73&amp;deg;C; 36.88&amp;deg;C). The main conclusion regarding the average human body temperature based on this dataset, is thus that the best estimate of the true mean is 36.81&amp;deg;C and we are 95% confident that the true value is somewhere in the range of (36.73&amp;deg;C; 36.88&amp;deg;C). It is the latter part of the statement, which is crucial to appreciating the value of a statistical analysis: If conducted properly it yields a measure of the uncertainty of the results, or in everyday words we have measured the likely distance to the true value, ''eventhough'' we don't know its exact value.

This page is very big.  Maybe i should split it up into several pages?  Comment here over the next few days if there is a problem with that.[[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 09:36, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

I clicked on the link to this page expecting to see the Amateur Radio Bandplan. The content of this page is irrelevant to amateur radio! [[User:Dodger67|Dodger67]] 10:34, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

== Stuff on the page ==

Is all the stuff about radio stations in Germany relevant to amateur radio? Also, the parts about longwave, mediumwave and shortwave transmiters seems out of whack as there really arn't any amateur bands in the frequencys covered in that table. I'd expect to see something mentioning WWv/WWVH or CHU, or another time becon....

== More about stuff on page ==

Seeing as it doen't make sence for this to be here, and wikibooks has a history to it. I will be removing the content in one step, and adding things such as frequencys for WWV, WWVH, and CHU Canada. I know there are more, but those are what I'll add for now.

On VFD, the general concensus (so far) is that this book be kept. I think however that it needs some work. I dont know where (if anywhere) that this book is shelved. I think that this book needs to expand it's list of topics to cover. I would be happy to start fleshing this book out in the coming weeks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:53, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

I just wanted to say... This is a great page!!! I already know the kana, but it helped me remember the proportions of every letter and the correct way to write them. The Mnemonics are great!! Havent seen alot of good Japanese guide pages like this on the net =)

[[User:Obake|Obake]] 15:56, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

== Very good lesson - please provide more! ==

I'm a beginner at Japanese and I'd like to learn the entire Hiragana. At first I thought it was going to be an impossible task because of my bad memory for shapes, but this lesson made it really simple. Please create lessons for the rest of the Hiragana too!! [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 19:21, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

Never mind, I just saw that on &quot;Kana Lessons&quot; there are more. However, this first lessson should link to the rest, and so should the overview page where I only saw lesson 1!

== English-equivalent &quot;Sounds-Like&quot;'s ==

The then-current version did not actually say HOW to pronounce the vowels, so I added some allegories. Could use more polish. - [[Special:Contributions/116.71.38.86|116.71.38.86]] ([[User talk:116.71.38.86|talk]])

== Suggestion == 

Throughout this section, the links to the next lesson contain the Japanese text, along with arrows (such as ''On to Lesson 2 - かきくけこ&gt;&gt;''). I would like to suggest removing the arrows (or at least separating them with a space from the other text) so that beginners don't mistake them for Japanese characters. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 01:17, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

== Pronunciation guides, without country-specific bias? ==

The first example says it's pronounced like 'a as in alright', but based on which country's English though? The 'a' in 'alright' sounds like 'ah' for North Americans and 'aww' for Brits and Australians. I suppose the example given is the American version, but as not all the readers of this will be American could there be more general examples given please.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Guide to Unix}}

{{wikipedia|Unix-like}}
{{wikipedia|Unix}}
The [[w:operating system|operating system]] installed on many [[w:server|servers]] and some [[w:computer workstation|workstations]] is '''Unix-like'''. But what does it mean to be [[wikt:like#Preposition|like]] Unix? In this book, a Unix-like system is one that is similar to [[../BSD|*BSD]], [[../Linux|GNU/Linux]], [[w:Solaris Operating Environment|Solaris]], and [[w:Research Unix|the original Unix]]. Today, [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X]] also qualifies as a Unix-like system.

==General Concepts==
As opposed to the (point and click) (graphical user interfaces) familiar to the general computer user, work usually gets done in unix in a text-based way, through what's known as the (command line shell).

As opposed to a (single-user) operating system which permits computer usage only by one person at one particular time, unix is a
multi-user system, that allows access of multiple users to the computer simultaneously. Normally this is achieved by having the
users access the system (remotely), through digital networks.

Whether accessing (remotely) or not, users need a (user account) before being granted access to the system; for the purposes of
accounting, security, logging and resource management.

Since each particular user account has varying degrees of control over the system and its resources, having the ability to verify
the true identity of a given user is crucial, so a method exists that verifies each user account (username) against a corresponding
(password); in a process known as (logging in).

All Unix-like systems are similar. As with many operating systems for servers, the Unix-like systems can host multiple users and programs simultaneously. Some features are specific to Unix-like systems. The Unix-like systems provide a common [[w:command line interface|command line interface]] called the ''shell''. They also provide a common programming interface for the [[Programming:C|C language]]. The latter fact allows most Unix-like systems to run the same [[:Category:Computer software|application software]] and [[:Category:Desktop environments|desktop environments]].

Unix is popular with programmers for a variety of reasons. A primary reason for its popularity is the building-block approach, where a suite of simple tools can be streamed together to produce very sophisticated results. Another reason is the philosophy that 'everything is a file', which means that a standardized set of operations and functionality can be performed on different file types (directories vs. regular files), hardware devices, and even system processes.

==The shell==
{{wikipedia|Unix shell}}
The ''shell'' is a program unique to Unix-like systems. It lets you type commands to launch other programs.

When you login to the system through a text-only terminal, Unix gives you a login shell. If your system has a [[w:graphical user interface|graphical user interface]] such as [[Using GNOME|GNOME]], [[Using KDE|KDE]], or anything that uses [[Guide to X11|X Window System]], you can access the shell through a program called a console emulator or terminal emulator. This emulates the text-only terminal that the shell requires for running.

Unfortunately, the shell and the commands are hard to learn. Further, many commands require &quot;arguments&quot; to work. For example, the '''rm''' command, which removes files, needs one or more &quot;arguments&quot; naming the files to delete. This book has a [[../Explanations/Shell Prompt/]] chapter which introduces the shell and its many features.

One can automate tasks by saving shell commands in a text file called a [[w:shell script|shell script]]. For example, shell scripts are used to boot the system.

The Unix shell is unique to Unix-like systems. Actually, there are multiple shells available for Unix. These shells extend their features in different ways. For the &quot;Bourne-compatible&quot; shells, there is a book in Wikibooks,[[Bourne Shell Scripting]], to describe them. Most shell scripts are for Bourne-compatible shells.

==The C language==
Unix is the origin of the popular [[Programming:C|C language]]. Every program on the computer links to the ''C library'' which provides basic system features including access to the kernel. Even if an application is written in another language, like C++, it still links to the C library. An interpreted language like perl needs a perl interpreter linked to the C library.

This dependence on C can be a disadvantage. Most Unix-like kernels are written entirely in C; most common programs use C, [[Programming:C plus plus|C++]] or [[Programming:Objective-C|Objective-C]]. It is difficult to add code to these programs in another language such as Fortran. In contrast, some non-Unix systems allow different programming languages to interact more easily.

This book does not describe how to program with C; that is the job of the book [[Programming:C]]. However, planned additions to this book will describe how to build and run Unix programs when you obtain their C source code.

==The kernel and userland==

{{wikipedia|kernel (computer science)}}
{{wikipedia|userland}}
Each Unix-like system has a ''kernel''. This program controls the computer [[wikt:hardware|hardware]].

All other programs on the system are part of ''userland'', which means outside the kernel. The kernel shares the system between all running userland programs. To use the keyboard, the network connection, or another part of the hardware, a userland program must contact the kernel using [[w:system call|system calls]]. The kernel allows multiple programs to share the hardware safely. It also switches programs in and out of the [[w:Central processing unit|processors]]; thus it is a &quot;[[w:Computer multitasking|multitasking]]&quot; kernel.

For example, a web server like [[w:Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], through the kernel, can simultaneously make multiple network connections to multiple web browsers. The same computer might also be running other server programs. As another example, a user on desktop system (with [[Using GNOME|GNOME]], [[Using KDE|KDE]], or [[w:Xfce|Xfce]] for example) can simultaneously open multiple windows containing file managers, word processors, and games. While the file manager copies files and the word processor prints a document, the user can play a Tetris clone at the same time.

Today, a very popular kernel is [[../Linux/]]. [[w:Linux kernel|Linux]] qualifies as [[w:Free_software free|free]] and [[w:open source|open source]]; even if Linux is running a server for millions of users, there is no licensing fee. Linux is usually combined with [[w:GNU|GNU]] to form the UNIX-like operating system, GNU/Linux (although there are some instances where it isn't combined with GNU). Thus, an easy way for a home user to obtain a Unix-like system is to install a GNU/Linux distribution that includes a friendly desktop.

When we want to configure the network connection, storage systems, or other parts of the hardware, we must often use special utility programs that configure the running kernel. Some of those programs are described in this book.

==Neutral point of view==
The intention is that this book has [[WB:NPOV|neutral point of view]]. Thus, this book claims not that Unix is always the best choice for any task. It will mention both advantages and disadvantages of Unix-like systems.

{{TOCleft}}
An '''environment variable''' is a setting normally inherited or declared when a shell is started. You can use shells to set variables; the syntax varies but Bourne shells use:

 '''$ ''VARNAME''=''&quot;new value&quot;'''''
 '''$ export ''VARNAME'''''
 ''or''
 '''$ export ''VARNAME''=''&quot;new value&quot;'''''

Each program started from that shell will have ''VARNAME'' set to ''new value''. The names of environment variables are case-sensitive; by convention they are uppercase.

A '''shell variable''' is like an environment variable, except that it is not exported to new programs started from that shell. (You could export it, but normally you just write a shell initialisation script to set it in each shell.)

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==EDITOR==
The editor program called by sudoedit, vipw, and other such programs when you tell them to edit a file.

''Examples:''
 EDITOR=vi

 EDITOR=emacs

Also see '''VISUAL'''.

==HOME==
The home directory of the user. Most programs use this shell variable to find your home, thus you can set this variable to override the setting in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt; for your home directory. This way, you can start programs that put dotfiles or other files in a different directory than your usual home directory.

In most shells, &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; refers to your home directory. In C shell, and some more recent versions of Bourne shell, &lt;tt&gt;~tux&lt;/tt&gt; always refers to the home directory of user tux as specified in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt;, while &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; (without a username after it) always refers to the value of HOME, even if it differs from your home directory in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt;.

==LOGNAME==
The name of the user. This is an easy way for a user to get own username. However, programs must not trust this variable because it can be set to an arbitrary value.

Both LOGNAME and USER should be set to the username.

''Examples:''
 LOGNAME=tux

 LOGNAME=sudhir

==MAIL==
The location of incoming local email. When '''mail''' or another local email reader inherits this environment variable, it uses this variable to find the inbox.

Some users do not have email at their local Unix box, but instead use the Internet to access their mail server, in which case the MAIL environment variable is irrelevant.

Many users do not have MAIL set, in which case the email reader uses the default setting. The default value for user &quot;tux&quot; would be &lt;tt&gt;/var/mail/tux&lt;/tt&gt;, which is where many systems deliver mail.

==MAILCHECK==
:''This is a shell variable, not normally exported as an environment variable.''

The frequency for which &quot;bash&quot; checks and alerts you for new local email.

==MANPATH==
The path used by the man(1) command to search for manual pages.  The MANPATH environment variable is formatted with ':' separators just like the PATH environment variable.

==PAGER==
The pager called by man and other such programs when you tell them to view a file.

''Examples:''
 PAGER=less

 PAGER=more

==PATH==
A space or colon separated list of directories in which the shell searches for executables when a command is run without an absolute path. For example '''ls''' doesn't have an absolute path, but '''/bin/ls''' does).

Some systems set PATH using the system shell initialization files, such as &lt;tt&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/tt&gt; for Bourne shells. Some systems set PATH before this as part of the login procedure, for example in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/login.conf&lt;/tt&gt; for OpenBSD systems. For example, a Linux box could set the PATH at login, then add &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6/bin&lt;tt&gt; to the path using &lt;tt&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/tt&gt;, then add &lt;tt&gt;/home/ambler/bin&lt;/tt&gt; to the path using &lt;tt&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/tt&gt;.

The system boot scripts also set PATH. On some Linux boxes, the first command to set the path would seem to be in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit, which is one of the shell scripts invoked by the init process (inittab).

''Examples:''
 PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/home/puffy/bin

If this PATH is set and you type the shell command
 $ '''uname -r'''

then the shell searches for the &quot;uname&quot; executable program. First it searches in /bin, then /sbin, then /usr/bin. If /bin/uname is an executable (which it should be), then the shell stops searching and runs it. If /home/puffy/bin/uname also is executable, it is not run, because the search never reached that directory.

In most cases, you only append to the PATH shell variable before exporting it to the PATH environment variable.  To delete a directory from your search path, you must reassign the entire PATH variable to a new, shorter string, and often this takes a great deal of typing or some cut and paste operations.

==PS1==
:''This is a shell variable, not normally exported as an environment variable.''

The '''bash''' and public domain '''ksh''' shells use this as the prompt string.

Things that can be put in the prompt string include &lt;tt&gt;\h&lt;/tt&gt; (hostname), &lt;tt&gt;\u&lt;/tt&gt; (username), &lt;tt&gt;\w&lt;/tt&gt; (absolute pathname of working directory), &lt;tt&gt;\W&lt;/tt&gt; (name of working directory w/o path), &lt;tt&gt;\d&lt;/tt&gt; (date), &lt;tt&gt;\t&lt;/tt&gt; (time).

On some Red Hat boxes, the primary prompt string is set in the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/bashrc&lt;/tt&gt; file. The prompt is also set in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/tt&gt;, but the setting in bashrc seems to take precedence. A &lt;tt&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt; file runs /etc/bashrc, which sets the prompt. Because every instance of &quot;bash&quot; runs &lt;tt&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt;, the prompt also appears in X sessions started from a display manager such as &quot;xdm&quot;.

On some Slackware boxes, the command line prompt is set in /etc/profile. The xterm and rxvt prompts are different. The prompt is not set for X sessions, but it would be if you write a &lt;tt&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt; to do that. Prompts are shell variables set from shell initialisation scripts. They are not xterm settings set by X resources such as &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm&lt;/tt&gt;.

* ''A Practical Guide to Linux'', by Mark G. Sobell and published by Addison-Wesley (1998), has more information on prompt strings at page 331.

==PS2==
:''This is a Primary shell variable, not normally exported as an environment variable.''

The '''bash''' and public domain '''ksh''' shells use this as a secondary prompt string.

==USER==
This variable should have the same setting and purpose as [[#LOGNAME|LOGNAME]].

==VISUAL==
This variable is used to specify the &quot;visual&quot; - ''screen-oriented'' - editor.  Generally you will want to set it to the same value as the EDITOR variable.  Originally EDITOR would have be set to '''ed''' (a line-based editor) and VISUAL would've been set to '''vi''' (a screen-based editor).  These days, you're unlikely to ever find yourself using a  teletype as your terminal, so there is no need to choose different editors for the two.  Nevertheless, it is useful to have both set:  Many programs, including less and crontab, will invoke VISUAL to edit a file, falling back to EDITOR if VISUAL is not set - but others invoke EDITOR directly.

''Examples:''
 VISUAL=mg

 VISUAL=vi

See also '''EDITOR'''.

=Learning objectives=
Upon completion of this chapter, for a single entity you will be able to 
* create a report specification entirely in XML for Cognos ReportNet
* update a report specification in XML format.
* identify four main sections in a report specification

=Introduction=

Every report created in Cognos ReportNet has a specification that is written in XML, so you can customize it using XML editor or create a report specification entirely in XML.  

=Report Specification Flow=

After you save a report and open it again,  the report specification is pulled from the content store as you can see in Figure 28.1.  When you edit it, the changes remain local on the client machine until you save it. When you save the report, the content store is updated.



Figure 28.1 Report Specification Flow

You can see a sample of web report  in figure 28.2 and this report can be generated from XML file;




Figure 28.2 Sample of a report


=XML in Report Specification Structure=
A report specification consists of four main sections.
* Report Section
** XML Tag: 
*** &lt;report&gt;
*** &lt;modelConnection&gt;
* Query Section
** XML Tag:
*** &lt;querySet&gt;
* Layout Section
** XML Tag:
*** &lt;layoutList&gt;
* Variable Section
** XML Tag:
*** &lt;variableList&gt;

At minimum, a report specification must include the &lt;report&gt;&lt;/report&gt; tags, as well as authoring language and schema information.


The specification header  in Report Section includes information about:
* authoring language, “en-us” indicates American English.  You can use other language than English  for the report
* namespace : http://developer.sample.com/schemas/report/1
* package name: GSR
* model version : @name='model'


&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD bgcolor=&quot;lightyellow&quot;&gt;
&lt;report xml:lang=&quot;en-us&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://developer.sample.com/schemas/report/1/&quot;&gt;&lt;!--RS:1.1--&gt;
	&lt;modelConnection name=&quot;/content/package[@name='GSR']/model[@name='model']&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


The query section includes information about:
* Cube elements are indicated by the &lt;cube&gt;&lt;/cube&gt; tags which can contain: 
** facts (&lt;factList&gt;&lt;/factList&gt;. Country, First Name and Last Name are the facts.
** dimensions (&lt;dimension&gt;&lt;/dimension&gt;) consisting of levels(&lt;level&gt;&lt;/level&gt;)
** filters (&lt;filter&gt;&lt;/filters&gt; consiting of conditions(&lt;condition&gt;&lt;/conditions&gt;). Country is the filter    for this report, which is equal to Germany.
* Tabular model is contained in the &lt;tabularModel&gt;&lt;/tabularModel&gt; tags.
** Each tabular model contains data items (&lt;dataItem&gt;&lt;/dataItem&gt;) consisting of fully qualified expressions (&lt;expression&gt;&lt;/expression&gt;)
* The query section of a report is contained in the &lt;querySet&gt;&lt;/querySet&gt;tags.
* The query section can include multiple queries, each of which is contained in the   &lt;BIQuery&gt;&lt;/BIQuery&gt;tags.


Add pages to a report specification:
*You can add many pages to a report. Each page is outlined between the &lt;pageSet&gt; &lt;/pageSet&gt;tags.
** Each page can consist of :
***a body ( mandatory)
***a header
***a footer


Add layout objects to a report:
*Once you have added one or more pages to the report layout, you can add a variety of layout objects, such as : 
** Text items
** Blocks
** Lists
** Charts
** Crosstabs
** Tables


Specify styles for layout objects:
* You can use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) attributes to determine the look and feel of objects in the layout.
* CSS values are specified between the &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tags.
* CSS values can apply to things like font sizes, background colors, and so forth.


Add Variables to a Report:
* You can specify variables between the &lt;variableList&gt;&lt;/variableList&gt; tags of the report specification., and each of variable includes an expression between the &lt;expression&gt;&lt;/expression&gt; tags. 
* We can use Variable 1 that contains a list of possible values, example value: fr for using French language;


&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD bgcolor=&quot;lightyellow&quot;&gt;
        &lt;variableList&gt;
         &lt;variable name=”Variable1” type=”locale”&gt;
          &lt;expression&gt;ReportLocale()&lt;/expression&gt;
           &lt;variableValueList&gt;
            &lt;variableValue value=”fr”/&gt;
           &lt;/varialeValueList&gt;
          &lt;/variable&gt;
         &lt;/variableList&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;


Below is the complete XML file for the report in Figure 28.3

      <comment>Reintroducing the paragraph on constructors in a slightly abridged form.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">﻿{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Elementary Haskell}}
You're not restricted to working with just the types provided by default with the language. There are many benefits to defining your own types:

* Code can be written in terms of the problem being solved, making programs easier to design, write and understand. 
* Related pieces of data can be brought together in ways more convenient and meaningful than simply putting and getting values from lists or tuples. 
* Pattern matching and the type system can be used to their fullest extent by making them work with your custom types. 

Haskell has three basic ways to declare a new type:

* The &lt;tt&gt;data&lt;/tt&gt; declaration, which defines new data types.
* The &lt;tt&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt; declaration for type synonyms.
* The &lt;tt&gt;newtype&lt;/tt&gt; declaration, which is a cross between the other two.

In this chapter, we will discuss &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;. We'll also mention &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, which is a convenience feature. We will explain &lt;code&gt;newtype&lt;/code&gt; later on, but don't worry too much about it; it exists mainly for optimisation.

== &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; and constructor functions ==

&lt;tt&gt;data&lt;/tt&gt; is used to define new data types using existing ones as building blocks. Here's a data structure for elements in a simple list of anniversaries:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Anniversary = Birthday String Int Int Int       -- name, year, month, day
                 | Wedding String String Int Int Int -- spouse name 1, spouse name 2, year, month, day
&lt;/source&gt;

This declares a new data type &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt;, which can be either a Birthday or a Wedding.  A Birthday ''contains'' one string and three integers and a Wedding ''contains'' two strings and three integers. The definitions of the two possibilities are separated by the vertical bar. The comments explain to readers of the code about the intended use of these new types. Moreover, with the declaration we also get two ''constructor functions'' for &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt;; appropriately enough, they are called &lt;tt&gt;Birthday&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Wedding&lt;/tt&gt;. These functions provide a way to build a new &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt;.

Types defined by &lt;tt&gt;data&lt;/tt&gt; declarations are often referred to as ''algebraic data types'', which is something we will address further in later chapters.

As usual with Haskell, the case of the first letter is important: type names and constructor functions must start with capital letters. Other than this syntactic detail, constructor functions work pretty much like the &quot;conventional&quot; functions we met so far. In fact, if you use &lt;tt&gt;:t&lt;/tt&gt; in GHCi to query the type of, say, &lt;tt&gt;Birthday&lt;/tt&gt;, you'll get:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; :t Birthday
Birthday :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Anniversary
}}

Meaning it's just a function which takes one String and three Int as arguments and ''evaluates to'' an &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt;. This anniversary will contain the four arguments we passed as specified by the &lt;tt&gt;Birthday&lt;/tt&gt; constructor.

Calling constructors is no different from calling other functions. For example, suppose we have John Smith born on 3rd July 1968:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
johnSmith :: Anniversary
johnSmith = Birthday &quot;John Smith&quot; 1968 7 3
&lt;/source&gt;

He married Jane Smith on 4th March 1987:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
smithWedding :: Anniversary
smithWedding = Wedding &quot;John Smith&quot; &quot;Jane Smith&quot; 1987 3 4
&lt;/source&gt;

These two anniversaries can, for instance, be put in a list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
anniversariesOfJohnSmith :: [Anniversary]
anniversariesOfJohnSmith = [johnSmith, smithWedding]
&lt;/source&gt;

Or you could just as easily have called the constructors straight away when building the list (although the resulting code looks a bit cluttered).

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
anniversariesOfJohnSmith = [Birthday &quot;John Smith&quot; 1968 7 3, Wedding &quot;John Smith&quot; &quot;Jane Smith&quot; 1987 3 4]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Deconstructing types ==

To use our new data types, we must have a way to access their contents. For instance, one very basic operation with the anniversaries defined above would be extracting the names and dates they contain as a String. So we need a &lt;tt&gt;showAnniversary&lt;/tt&gt; function (for the sake of code clarity, we used an auxiliary &lt;tt&gt;showDate&lt;/tt&gt; function but let's ignore it for a moment):

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
showDate :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; String
showDate y m d = show y ++ &quot;-&quot; ++ show m ++ &quot;-&quot; ++ show d

showAnniversary :: Anniversary -&gt; String

showAnniversary (Birthday name year month day) =
   name ++ &quot; born &quot; ++ showDate year month day

showAnniversary (Wedding name1 name2 year month day) =
   name1 ++ &quot; married &quot; ++ name2 ++ &quot; on &quot; ++ showDate year month day
&lt;/source&gt;

This example shows how we can deconstruct the values built in our data types.  &lt;tt&gt;showAnniversary&lt;/tt&gt; takes a single argument of type &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt;. Instead of just providing a name for the argument on the left side of the definition, however, we specify one of the constructor functions and give names to each argument of the constructor (which correspond to the contents of the Anniversary). A more formal way of describing this &quot;giving names&quot; process is to say we are ''binding variables''. &quot;Binding&quot; is being used in the sense of assigning a variable to each of the values so that we can refer to them on the right side of the function definition.

To handle both &quot;Birthday&quot; and &quot;Wedding&quot; Anniversaries, we needed to provide ''two'' function definitions, one for each constructor. When &lt;tt&gt;showAnniversary&lt;/tt&gt; is called, if the argument is a &lt;tt&gt;Birthday&lt;/tt&gt; Anniversary, the first definition is used and the variables &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;month&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;date&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;year&lt;/tt&gt; are bound to its contents. If the argument is a &lt;tt&gt;Wedding&lt;/tt&gt; Anniversary, then the second definition is used and the variables are bound in the same way. This process of using a different version of the function depending on the type of constructor is pretty much like what happens when we use a &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt; statement or define a function piece-wise.

Note that the parentheses around the constructor name and the bound variables are mandatory; otherwise the compiler or interpreter would not take them as a single argument. Also, it is important to have it absolutely clear that the expression inside the parentheses is ''not'' a call to the constructor function, even though it may look just like one.

{{Exercises|1=
''Note: The solution of this exercise is given near the end of the chapter, so we recommend that you attempt it before getting there.''&lt;/br&gt;
Reread the function definitions above. Then look closer at the &lt;tt&gt;showDate&lt;/tt&gt; helper function. We said it was provided &quot;for the sake of code clarity&quot;, but there is a certain clumsiness in the way it is used. You have to pass three separate Int arguments to it, but these arguments are always linked to each other as part of a single date. It would make no sense to do things like passing the year, month and day values of the Anniversary in a different order, or to pass the month value twice and omit the day.
* Could we use what we've seen in this chapter so far to reduce this clumsiness?
* Declare a &lt;tt&gt;Date&lt;/tt&gt; type which is composed of three Int, corresponding to year, month and date. Then, rewrite &lt;tt&gt;showDate&lt;/tt&gt; so that it uses the new Date data type. What changes will then be needed in &lt;tt&gt;showAnniversary&lt;/tt&gt; and the &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt; for them to make use of Date?.
}}

== &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; for making type synonyms ==

As mentioned in the introduction of this module, code clarity is one of the motivations for using custom types. In that spirit, it could be nice to make it clear that the Strings in the Anniversary type are being used as ''names'' while still being able to manipulate them like ordinary Strings. This calls for a &lt;tt&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt; declaration:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
type Name = String
&lt;/source&gt;

The code above says that a &lt;tt&gt;Name&lt;/tt&gt; is now a synonym for a &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt;. Any function that takes a &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt; will now take a &lt;tt&gt;Name&lt;/tt&gt; as well (and vice-versa: functions that take &lt;tt&gt;Name&lt;/tt&gt; will accept any &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt;). The right hand side of a &lt;tt&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt; declaration can be a more complex type as well. For example, &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt; itself is defined in the standard libraries as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
type String = [Char]
&lt;/source&gt;

We can do something similar for the list of anniversaries we made use of:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
type AnniversaryBook = [Anniversary]
&lt;/source&gt;

Since type synonyms are mostly just a convenience. They help make the roles of types clearer or provide an alias to such things as complicated list or tuple types. It is largely a matter of personal discretion to decide how type synonyms should be deployed. Abuse of synonyms could make code confusing (for instance, picture a long program using multiple names for common types like Int or String simultaneously).

Incorporating the suggested type synonyms and the &lt;tt&gt;Date&lt;/tt&gt; type we proposed in the exercise(*) of the previous section the code we've written so far looks like this:
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
((*) '''last chance to try that exercise without looking at the spoilers.''')
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
type Name = String

data Anniversary = 
   Birthday Name Date
   | Wedding Name Name Date

data Date = Date Int Int Int   -- Year, Month, Day

johnSmith :: Anniversary
johnSmith = Birthday &quot;John Smith&quot; (Date 1968 7 3)

smithWedding :: Anniversary
smithWedding = Wedding &quot;John Smith&quot; &quot;Jane Smith&quot; (Date 1987 3 4)

type AnniversaryBook = [Anniversary]

anniversariesOfJohnSmith :: AnniversaryBook
anniversariesOfJohnSmith = [johnSmith, smithWedding]

showDate :: Date -&gt; String
showDate (Date y m d) = show y ++ &quot;-&quot; ++ show m ++ &quot;-&quot; ++ show d 

showAnniversary :: Anniversary -&gt; String
showAnniversary (Birthday name date) =
   name ++ &quot; born &quot; ++ showDate date
showAnniversary (Wedding name1 name2 date) =
   name1 ++ &quot; married &quot; ++ name2 ++ &quot; on &quot; ++ showDate date
&lt;/source&gt;

Even in a simple example like this one, there is a noticeable gain in simplicity and clarity compared to the same task using only Ints, Strings, and corresponding lists.

Note that the &lt;tt&gt;Date&lt;/tt&gt; type has a constructor function which is called &lt;tt&gt;Date&lt;/tt&gt; as well. That is perfectly valid and indeed giving the constructor the same name of the type when there is just one constructor is good practice, as a simple way of making the role of the function obvious.

{{body note|1=
After these initial examples, the mechanics of using constructor functions may look a bit unwieldy, particularly if you're familiar with analogous features in other languages. There are syntactical constructs that make dealing with constructors more convenient. These will be dealt with later on, when we return to the topic of constructors and data types to explore them in detail.

There may be a subject that is titled &quot;Medical Informatics&quot; but as this topic is defined as multidisciplinary, the title of this subject should not be &quot;Medical Informatics.&quot; Medical with a capital &quot;M&quot; refers to the practice of medicine by those with M.D. or D.O. credentials and regulated by [http://www.chronicfatiguetreatments.com cfs] state Boards of Medical Examiners. Medical informatics is a sub-field of medicine and of concern primarily to those in medical practice, research, or education. Health informatics is bigger than that. Health informatics belongs to many - including the general public - and refers to the structure, storage, access and retrieval, and use of health information derived from many perspectives and useful in achieving personally valued health and wellness goals. Medical informatics belongs to doctors. Health informatics belongs to everyone and is inclusive of a portion of Medical Informatics.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: competitve → competitive (2) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Workout==
For wrestling, submission/BJJ, or MMA, I like interval training, that is, doing a workout (whatever it happens to be) at an alternating aerobic and anaerobic pace. My goal, with regard to the conditioning element of a match, is to keep up a good aerobic pace with my opponent, of course forcing him to do the same in the process, then attack (anaerobic activity pressing such also on my opponent in response to me), then go back to an aerobic pace, repeating the process throughout the match. My thinking is that the winner conditioning-wise is the individual who can recover from an anaerobic burst back to an aerobic state to prepare for the next successful anaerobic burst or attack the quickest.

So when I train for competition I may, for example, roll with somebody at a typical solid aerobic pace for one minute, be very aggressive the next 30 seconds, go back to an aerobic pace for a minute, and so on. Or your could run (jog, sprint, jog, sprint, etc.) in a similar manner. Or your could to a hard takedown drill for two minutes and jog for one, repeating the process over and over. You get the picture.

Also, keep track of how many minutes of aerobic and anaerobic activity you are doing to increase it gradually and systematically so you know for sure how your training is going. It is not just the volume of training (more is not always better as you can overtrain) but also how you train whether you are talking technique, conditioning, or strength.


I generally try to maintain a modicum of noncompetition shape for general training (learning to improve the technical aspect of my game), although there have been times over the past couple of years that has simply not been possible. I like to cycle my training for both physical and mental preparation reasons. It has been my experience that you need to avoid the same routine all year else you get burned out and fail to progress maximally. It is my understanding that lifting ought to be done with some variably in order of exercise to avoid habituating the nervous system; at least that's what I was taught at Penn State some years ago.

I think that it is wise to take (at least, depending on what you are trying to accomplish in the competitive arena) one day off per week even if you are training intensely for competition, again for both physical and mental reasons. There are some people, including those who are very good, who probably overtrain. Mimicking them because &quot;they are champions&quot;, etc. is not necessarily the wisest thing to do as some people win in spite of (versus because of) how they train. For example, some people train (cardio or strength) like maniacs but may win owing to technical and mental factors (including because of the volume of training) although may not objectively be in maximal physiologic condition (e.g., weaker than they would have been without overtraining).

If you are training two or three times per week BJJ, wrestling, etc., I would suggest lifting on other days. As you &quot;ramp up&quot; your training for competition (especially serious competition) that level of training is not likely to be adequate so you will have to lift on days you are training. I think you are right on target keeping the hours between your strength and jiu jitsu training maximal (if you lift before BJJ). I lift in the morning before work and train BJJ in the evening. My view is that you will profit from improving the technical aspect of your game when you are relatively fresh and not having a major fatigue factor interfering with learning or ingraining new skills (i.e., if you are drill technique with which you are not particularly familiar or proficient while fatigued you are probably going to take longer to develop skillful technique). Being a pipsqueak and rolling with guys, some of who are twice my size, it is just too risky injury-wise to get a hard lift in before BJJ practice. If I am hurt, I cannot train or compete adequately.

One option, depending on your schedule, would be to lift after your BJJ practice if time is really tight, although not vice versa which I think is risky (when you roll in BJJ).

One thing that is crucial, I think, is to recognize that, over the long run, it is skill, not conditioning or strength, that will be the largest factor in success. That is not to say that cardio, strength, nutrition, psychological preparation, etc. are not important, just make sure that in your &quot;training portfolio&quot; that actual training (learning technique and sparring technique) does not become &quot;the odd man out.&quot; &quot;Major in the major subjects, minor in the minor subjects.&quot; The other things are to supplement, not substitute, the whole reason for what you do: BJJ.

Also, recognize when it is worthwhile to just take a day off, particularly from lifting. My experience has been that three times per week is best for most of my training cycle but that when things really ramp up for competition it is easy, simply by virtue of the volume of training to increase in the upswing in your training cycle, to get fatigued, dread practice, etc. At that point, wisdom is taking a day off from lifting (get a massage, etc.) and even consider lifting twice per week toward the end of your training cycle as you get close to competition so that the volume of doing what you will be doing in competition increases proportionally. I personally have found it helpful to lift two days per week freeweights and one day Nautilus with a trainer who busts my you-know-whats for a brutal hour (with substantial negative training). I make that guy earn his 35 bucks (none of this just yapping motivational crap)! If I feel fatigued or start to feel burned out, I chuck one of the freeweight days.

When training now, I like to go on a short run 5x/week (two or three miles) before lifting. I gradually add interval training to the run. I am best at wrestling, second best at BJJ, and weakest with my stand up. Therefore, in part because of inefficiency with my boxing, I find that an excellent cardio workout. I think that skills with which were are most proficient (read efficient) are a bit more of a challenge to push ourselves with. So boxing rounds with a partner holding mitts does me wonders, again, in part as I am less skilled and efficient (and therefore get more fatigued) with those techniques.

One exercise I like for cardio, strength, and mental reasons, and is easy to do in your BJJ room, is carrying a partner on my back around the perimeter of the room. You can do this in rounds with a brief walking break (i.e., to keep moving). This gets my heart rate through the roof if your partner (or instructor) can push and motivate you. You can do this to mimic rounds in a match or do the aerobic-anaerobic mix with your partner or coach telling you when to jog and when to sprint.

      <comment>Rejected the last text change (by [[Special:Contributions/82.11.123.85|82.11.123.85]]) and restored revision 2559261 by JackPotte</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Variables==
In programming a variable is simply a place to store data. A variable has a name and a data type. In Visual Basic .NET, a variable is declared using the Dim (short for Dimension) statement. Here is the syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim varName As varType
&lt;/source&gt;

''varName'' is the name of your variable.

''varType'' is the data type of the variable. Types include string, integer, double, boolean, etc.

For example, to declare an integer named MyInt use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim MyInt As Integer
&lt;/source&gt;


By default, the variables case doesn't allow to distinguish them, so ''myint'' will automatically be converted in ''MyInt'' by the IDE if it's declared like that.

On the other hand, to make a program ignore the case in the string values, &lt;code&gt;Option Compare Text&lt;/code&gt; should be added.

===Data Types===
Data Types define the type of data that a variable can store. Some variables store numbers, others store names. The built-in VB.NET type aliases and their equivalent .NET Framework types follow:

====Integers====
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!VB Alias||.NET Type||Size||Range
|-
|SByte||System.SByte||8 bits (1 byte)||-128 to 127

|}

====Other pre-defined types====
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!VB Alias||.NET Type||Size (bits)||Range
|-
|Char||System.Char||16 bits (2 bytes)||One Unicode symbol in the range of 0 to 65,535.
|-
|Boolean||System.Boolean||32 bits (4 bytes)||True or False
|-
|Object||System.Object||32/64 bits (4/8 bytes)||Platform dependent (a reference to an object).
|-

|}

==Using Variables==

===Assigning Values===


A value is the data contained in a variable.
To assign a value to a variable that is already declared, use an equal sign.

===Suffix for Literals===
Integral literals, such as 42 and 1000, are of type &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/font&gt; by default. String and character literals, such as &lt;font color=&quot;#A31515&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;#A31515&quot;&gt;&quot;À&quot;&lt;/font&gt;, are of type &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;String&lt;/font&gt; by default. To specify the type for a literal, suffixes are used. The suffixes are appended immediately after the literals, in the manner &amp;lt;literal&amp;gt;&amp;lt;suffix&amp;gt;, without any whitespace between.

===Examples===
For string and char variables, use double quotes around value:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 strMyVariable = &quot;The String&quot;
 chrMyVariable = &quot;À&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
For date variables, use hashes/pounds around the value, in the format #&amp;lt;month&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;day&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;hour&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;minute&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;second&amp;gt; &amp;lt;AM|PM&amp;gt;#:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 dtMyVariable = #7/4/1776 12:01:50 PM#
&lt;/source&gt;

For all others, remove the quotes and hashes/pounds:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 bytMyVariable = 1
 sbytMyVariable = -2
 shrtMyVariable = 10S
 ushrtMyVariable = 10US
 intMyVariable = 100
 uintMyVariable = 100UI
 lngMyVariable = 1000L
 ulngMyVariable = 1000UL
 sngMyVariable = 1.234F
 dblMyVariable = 1.567R
 decMyVariable = 1234567.89D
 boolMyVariable = True
 objMyObject = New Object
&lt;/source&gt;

===Initial Value===

To assign a variable the value of another variable, simply replace the value on the right side of the equal sign with the name of the variable that holds the desired data.

You can also assign a value to a variable in the declaration itself.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim myVariable As String = &quot;StringValue&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Important:''' Visual Basic always assigns the value of the right variable to the left variable. The variable on the left takes the value of the right variable. The variable on the right does not change.

==Constants==
Constants are like variables that don't change. They take the place of values that you would not like to type over and over. Constants are declared using the keyword &quot;Const&quot;. Their values are defined in their declaration - they also use data types.
Here is the syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Const cnstMyConstant As String = &quot;The very long string&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Here is an example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Const cnstPi As Single = 3.14159265F
&lt;/source&gt;
Constants are very useful when you need to type the same numbers/strings/etc many times.
For example, to convert from radians to degrees you can type 180/Pi constant:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Const cnstRadToDeg As Single = 57,29579143
&lt;/source&gt;
And use it like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Degrees = Radians / cnstRadToDeg
&lt;/source&gt;
This constant is useful in functions like Sin, Cos, Tan, Arctan, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Simple arrays==
An array is simply a variable that can store more then one piece of data. The data is stored in a list. If you declare an integer, then that variable can only store one integer. An array of integers can store many integers. Each one is given its own number. &lt;br/&gt;
For example, this line of code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim MyArray(5) As Integer
&lt;/source&gt;

will give an array like this

{|
|'''Index'''
|'''Data'''
|-
|00
|Nothing
|-
|01
|Nothing
|-
|02
|Nothing
|-
|03
|Nothing
|-
|04
|Nothing
|-
|05
|Nothing
|-
|}
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim arrayName(upperBound) As arrayType
&lt;/source&gt;

This is similar to declaring a normal variable with one difference, the upperBound argument. 
Unlike previous versions versions of Visual Basic, all arrays in Visual Basic .NET start at 0 and go to the upperBound, for Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim MyArray(10) As Integer
&lt;/source&gt;

will declare a variable called MyArray with space for 11 Integers.
The integers are stored in MyArray(0), MyArray(1),..., MyArray(10).

To declare an array and assign values in a single line, use the following
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim MyArray() As Integer = New Integer(4) { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Another way to create an array is as follows
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()

       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;c&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;d&quot;
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()

   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that anytime these lines are used:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim MyArray As System.Array
 MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
&lt;/source&gt;

This means the same thing, and is easier to use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
&lt;/source&gt;

The (''number'') after the name of the variable declares it as a string.

To access one of the elements in the array:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()

       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;c&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;d&quot;
       Console.WriteLine(MyArray.GetValue(2)) 'returns c
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()

   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

How many elements do we have in the array?
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;c&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;d&quot;
       Console.WriteLine(MyArray.Length)
       'displays 4
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
       '    
   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

Display all the elements in the array.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;d&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;c&quot;
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       '
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

Sort the array.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;d&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;c&quot;
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Before sorting&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       Array.Sort(MyArray)
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;After sorting&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

Sort in descending order.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       Dim DescSortCompare = New DescSortCompareClass
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;d&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;c&quot;
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Before descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       Array.Sort(MyArray, DescSortCompare)
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;After descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
   '
   Public Class DescSortCompareClass
       Implements IComparer
       '
       Function Compare(ByVal x As Object, ByVal y As Object) As Integer _
          Implements IComparer.Compare
           Return x &gt; y
       End Function
       '
   End Class
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

Reverse the array.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;d&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;c&quot;
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Before reversing the array&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       Array.Reverse(MyArray)
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;After reversing the array&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
   '
 End Module
&lt;/source&gt;

Now that we have &lt;code&gt;Reverse&lt;/code&gt;, here is another way to sort in descending order without &lt;code&gt;IComparer&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;d&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;c&quot;
       '
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Before descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       Array.Sort(MyArray)
       Array.Reverse(MyArray)
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;After descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
 End Module
&lt;/source&gt;

With Option Strict On, we would need to use SetValue to assign array elements.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Option Strict On
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray.SetValue(&quot;a&quot;, 0)
       MyArray.SetValue(&quot;d&quot;, 1)
       MyArray.SetValue(&quot;b&quot;, 2)
       MyArray.SetValue(&quot;c&quot;, 3)
       '
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Before descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       Array.Sort(MyArray)
       Array.Reverse(MyArray)
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;After descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
 End Module
&lt;/source&gt;

==Multi-Dimensional arrays==
Arrays also can be multi-dimensional - 2D, 3D, 4D etc.
For example, this line of code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 'Declare an 2D Array with integers(X, Y)
 Dim My2DArray(2, 2) As Integer
&lt;/source&gt;

Will give an array like this:
{|
|'''Index'''
|'''Data'''
|-
|0, 0
|Nothing
|-
|0, 1
|Nothing
|-
|0, 2
|Nothing
|-
|1, 0
|Nothing
|-
|1, 1
|Nothing
|-
|1, 2
|Nothing
|-
|2, 0
|Nothing
|-
|2, 1
|Nothing
|-
|2, 2
|Nothing
|-
|}

2D arrays can be used in games like a Tic-Tac-Toe.

3D arrays can be thought of as an array of 2D arrays.  Where a 2D array has rows and columns, as in a game of Tic Tac Toe, the 3D array stores multiple grids of Tic Tac Toe.

To declare a 3D array:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 'Declare an 3D Array of integers(X, Y)
 Dim My3DArray(1, 2, 2) As Integer
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, the first dimension would typically be the number of arrays in this 3D array.  We know these are 2D arrays as the second dimension specifies how many rows in these arrays and the third dimension the number of columns.

== Arrays manipulations methods ==
* &lt;code&gt;Split()&lt;/code&gt; : to transform a string into an array, according to the separator which is placed in parameter.
* &lt;code&gt;Join()&lt;/code&gt; : to convert an array into a string.
* &lt;code&gt;Filter()&lt;/code&gt; : to filter some array entries.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
     Dim ArrayName() As String = Split(&quot;lorem ipsum dolor sit&quot;, &quot; &quot;)
     Console.WriteLine(ArrayName(1))  ' displays &quot;ipsum&quot;

     ArrayName(4) = &quot;amet&quot;
     Dim ArrayContent As String = String.Join(&quot; &quot;, ArrayName)
     Console.WriteLine(ArrayContent)

     Dim SubArray = Filter(ArrayName, &quot;o&quot;, True, CompareMethod.Text)
     Console.WriteLine(String.Join(&quot; &quot;, SubArray))  ' displays the words including &quot;o&quot;

     Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Medieval art dates roughly from the period 500-1500 AD. 

European medieval art is generally centered around the architecture and icons of the Roman Catholic Church. The Christian Church grew from the fourth century onwards as the Roman empire collapsed. The pagan gods were no longer worshipped and such was the power of this new Christian religion that Iconoclasts destroyed early pagan statues and religious objects during the reign of Constantine, Emperor of Rome from 306 to 337. From the ashes of Classical Rome came a new Europe where the Christian Church became intricately entwined in the politics and economics of the day. Charlemagne (c. 742 – 814), a Frankish king, united Western Europe and was given the title &quot;Holy Roman Emperor&quot; (Imperator Augustus) by Pope Leo III on the 25 December 800 C.E. From this moment on the Christian Church and the State had forged a bond that would last for centuries.

== Romanesque ==
The Romanesque period refers roughly to the eleventh and first half of the twelfth centuries.  The term Romanesque was first given to this type of architecture in the 19th Century due to the use of round-headed arches and masonry barrel vaults, practices that had been common in ancient Roman architecture. The kinds of monuments that were sufficiently permanent to survive--mainly church buildings and sculpture--were commissioned by the Church.

Common characteristics of Romanesque architecture are thick, stone walls and large, exterior buttresses to support them, rounded arches, and barrel vaults.  The windows in these structures are usually small due to the restraints of using ashlar masonry.  The exteriors of Romanesque churches, as compared to the modular Carolingian and Ottonian churches of the ninth and tenth centuries, have unified decorative schemes of architectural and sculptural elements that unite the design as a whole.  These design elements include blind arcades, (rows of arches set flush against the wall's surface), and corbel tables, (series of arches mounted, not on columns, but on decorative stone brackets, called corbels), both of which often run around the entire perimeter; down the exterior nave wall, and around the transepts and apse, tying the structure together visually.

[[File:Psalm 24 Initial A.jpg|thumb|right|A 12th century manuscript page - Psalm 24]]

One major development of eleventh and twelfth-century architecture is the addition of increasingly elaborate programmes of figural sculpture on the exterior, particularly at the West end, usually the main entrance to the church.  Standing figures of sacred Biblical authors, such as prophets and apostles, as well as saints and Old Testament kings were placed against the walls beside the doorways, called jambs.  The arches over doorways, instead of being left open, were usually filled with semi-circular slabs of stone, called tympana (sing. tympanum).  The subject matter in the tympana was dominated by representations of the Last Judgment when, according to traditional teaching, Christ would return and divide the world into those who will receive eternal reward, and those who will be punished.  Romanesque sculpture is marked by a love of inventive surface patterns, and an expressive approach to the human body, using elongation, unnatural poses and emphatic gestures to convey states of mind.

Among smaller art forms, Romanesque manuscript illustrators continued to present full-page author portraits, for example, before the beginning of each Gospel book; but also elaborated the written word with historiated initials, that is, the first letter of a section drawn large, containing relevant figures or even narrative scenes; and marginal miniatures, the small scenes, sometimes fanciful and strange, drawn in the margins of the page.  Metalwork, and carved gems and ivory share some of the expressive and decorative qualities of monumental sculpture and manuscript painting.

== Gothic ==
Gothic architecture originated in southern France, around 1140, beginning with the innovative construction of the choir of Saint-Denis. Several characteristics mark Gothic architecture including the use of flying buttresses, elaborate stained-glass windows, ribbed vaults, pointed arches, and a distinct emphasis on verticality. 

'Several of these characteristics are exemplified in specific cathedrals:

'Flying buttresses: Notre Dame de Paris&lt;br&gt;
Stained Glass: Chartres Cathedral&lt;br&gt;
Distinct Verticality: Amiens Cathedral'

In contrast to the dark, claustrophobic Romanesque churches, Gothic cathedrals present a light, airy atmosphere due mainly to their ribbed vaults and flying buttresses which are able to support thinner walls, higher ceilings, and large, light filled windows.


== East Asian art, 500-1500 ==


== South Asian art, 500-1500 ==


== Islamic art to 1500 ==

From c. 670 to 1500, Islam expanded from its roots in modern-day Saudi Arabia to an empire stretching from Morocco to India. The spread of Islam throughout Eurasia was accompanied by the development of an artistic style which was closely related to Islam and its interpretation by regional dynasties. Islamic arts and architecture vary widely according to region but have a few unifying features. The Qur'an forbids depictions of the Prophet Muhammed and depictions of any person in religious art; therefore, Islamic artistic decoration is characterized by abstract floral and vegetal motifs rather than figural representation. Also, the Qu'ran discourages the construction of any building that would outlive its architect unless it serves Islam or the community in some way; therefore, surviving works, particularly works of architecture, tend to be public buildings like mosques, gardens and markets. (Palaces also frequently survive, although this could easily be because of the desire to preserve works of that quality of construction and decoration). Finally, the Arabic language, as the language of the Qur'an, is deeply embedded in Islamic artistic tradition; text is often featured as meaningful decoration in works of art and architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Guide to Unix/BSD}}

This page summarizes the main features of the *BSD kernel and system, especially in comparison to other Unix-like systems. Currently, this page covers the free variants of *BSD, especially DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. There are also nonfree variants.

The Wikibook, [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]], gives an overview of BSD in its [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems/Berkeley Software Distribution|Berkeley Software Distribution]] chapter.

==General==
* The *BSD systems are descendants of AT&amp;T Unix (though non-free Unix code was removed) so they feel more like Unix than  GNU/Linux.  AT&amp;T had cheaply licensed the code to universities including Berkeley where major enhancements such as TCP/IP was then developed. The last BSD release from Berkeley had non-free code removed so more persons could use it. Today, the *BSD projects honor their ancestry putting BSD at the end of their names.
* The four big *BSD systems are '''free software''' and '''open source'''. While *BSD does use some copylefted GNU programs, most of *BSD is '''not copyleft''', which leaves everyone free to make non-free versions of *BSD and distribute binaries without source code. However, some parts of *BSD have extra terms in the license that annoy some people, and which are not found in the GNU licenses. In particular, there was enough dislike for the &quot;advertising clause&quot; (which requires marks on certain ads) that the Regents of the University of California removed it from their license; some other *BSD copyright holders still use the clause.
* The core system, including kernel and userland, is maintained in one CVS tree. This is similar to OpenSolaris and OpenDarwin, but GNU/Linux programs and kernels are in separate trees, and the development trees of non-free Unix-like systems are normally not public. Compare:
** DragonFly BSD http://www.dragonflybsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/
** FreeBSD http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/
** NetBSD http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/
** OpenBSD http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/
** OpenSolaris http://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/
** OpenDarwin http://cvs.opendarwin.org/index.cgi/
* The *BSD sources are stored in '''/usr/src/''' and the kernel in '''/usr/src/sys/'''. The *BSD kernel and system programs are heavily integrated, and so must be upgraded together.

==Kernel==
* Recall that a ''kernel'' is the interface between programs and hardware. Unix-like kernels provide device drivers and networking support and allow multiple users and programs to share the system.
* The *BSD kernel (often installed at &quot;/bsd/&quot;) is ''monolithic'', which means that it is one program in one memory-addressing space. Thus the kernel avoids forming and sending messages between parts of itself.
** DragonFly BSD is changing some of this.
** The original AT&amp;T Unix and Linux are also monolithic, while mkLinux and the kernel of Mac OS X are modular.
* The kernel is actually the original AT&amp;T Unix with all of its files replaced. The BSD university project had added or replaced so much stuff (the VAX port, the networking features, the fast file system, ...) that *BSD projects could take the free parts and produce completely free kernels without needing a Unix license. A consequence of this is that the BSD kernel has a similar structure to commercial Unix kernels also descended from AT&amp;T Unix.
* The kernel contains a &quot;securelevel&quot; feature which attempts to permanently restrict what all users (including root, the superuser) can do after a certain point in the boot process.
* The kernel boot messages (also visible with '''dmesg''', on all Unix systems) are organized and shows where each device was detected.
** In contrast, the Linux drivers seem to give any boot messages that they feel like. The mounting and examining of &quot;/proc&quot; and &quot;/sys&quot;, or the use of tools like &quot;lspci&quot;, is a better strategy on Linux.

==Userland==
* Recall that ''userland'' consists of all the software above the kernel. This section describes the userland included with the base system.
* The programs in &lt;tt&gt;/bin/&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/sbin/&lt;/tt&gt; are statically linked.
** This is because &lt;tt&gt;/usr/&lt;/tt&gt; might not be mounted, so the shared library &lt;tt&gt;/usr/lib/libc.so&lt;/tt&gt; cannot be used.
** ''Static linking'' is when each program is in one file, without the need for other files (shared libraries) containing code shared by programs. The library code is copied into the programs.
* The main text editor in the base system is &quot;vi&quot;. This is nvi included with BSD, and ultimately the original vi, and is not some other vi implementation such as vim. Actually, nvi is a clone of the original vi. The clone was necessary to remove some non-free Unix code.
** OpenBSD also includes &quot;mg&quot;, an editor resembling Emacs 17 but without any free but copylefted GNU code. FreeBSD includes &quot;ee&quot;, the &quot;easy editor&quot; with some similarities to [http://www.nano-editor.org/ nano] and [http://www.washington.edu/pine/ pico] (both of which are in the ports tree, although nano is free software and pico isn't).

== Ports ==
* There is a ports tree or packages tree originally from FreeBSD. This consists of Makefiles that automate the downloading, extracting, patching, and building of software for *BSD. This is the main way of installing stuff that is not part of the base system.
** On NetBSD this is called '''pkgsrc'''. A unique feature of the pkgsrc tree is that it also works on other operating systems. DragonFly BSD also uses pkgsrc.
** Thus installing a program is often two easy steps. First, type a &quot;cd&quot; command to the directory containing the port (for example, &lt;tt&gt;/usr/ports/games/nethack/&lt;/tt&gt;). Then, type a &quot;make install&quot; command and wait for everything to finish.
** Building software takes a long time, so many prefer to use a binary package instead of a &quot;make install&quot;.
* The system compiler is the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) with C, C++, Objective C, and Fortran 77.
** By default, gcc does not look in &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/&lt;/tt&gt; for header files and libraries; it only looks at the base system.
** The base system can rebuild itself with gcc.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Guide to Unix/BSD}}

The core of Apple's Mac OS X (and its predecessor NextStep) is Darwin, which contains a lot of BSD code, especially FreeBSD 5 code.

==Background==
=== General ===
* Darwin, like other *BSD systems, is distributed as a complete Unix-like operating system, including the kernel, shell commands, C compiler, and other important utilities.
* Darwin is different from other *BSD systems. As listed below, it has several changes that the other *BSD systems lack.
* Darwin is named for [[wikipedia:Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin]].

=== Kernel ===
* ''Name:'' The kernel is called xnu. It consists of a modified Mach [[wikipedia:microkernel|microkernel]] and a &quot;server&quot; which is a port of the BSD kernel.
* ''Processor architecture:'' Mac OS X runs on both PowerPC- and Intel-based Macs
* ''Dualithic:'' The kernel uses a dualithic design. The Mach [[wikipedia:microkernel|microkernel]] contains device drivers, multitasking, and interprocess communication. Other kernel services, such as networking, filesystems, and traditional Unix system calls, must be provided by &quot;servers&quot;.
** Darwin uses one server, a port of the BSD kernel. Thus networking is similar to other *BSD systems and the UFS filesystem from BSD is also available. This is in contrast to GNU Hurd, which uses a difficult design consisting of many servers.
** NextStep probably introduced the dualithic design because Mach microkernel was more portable than BSD, or provided better multitasking benefits than BSD. They could port Mach to x86 and PowerPC. Since then, NetBSD has made *BSD very portable and created a monolithic NetBSD/macppc port. FreeBSD and OpenBSD are taking the NetBSD code for their Macintosh hardware ports.
** Apple (before it bought NextStep) used a similar strategy to port Linux, an x86 operating system, to PowerPC. The ''mkLinux'' (microkernel Linux) project started by porting Linux/x86 to use Mach. Then Mach was ported to Macintosh hardware. After Linux 2.0 appeared, Linux was more portable and the monolithic Linux/powerpc port displaced mkLinux. Apple bought NextStep and switched to using Darwin.
** The microkernel and server are tightly integrated. The microkernel expects the Darwin BSD server, so using another server, such as the mkLinux server, would be difficult.
* ''Device drivers:'' Because they are handled by Mach, device drivers are much different than in NetBSD/macppc. With Darwin, Apple made many replacements to the NextStep drivers.
** Darwin runs on any Mac the corresponding Mac OS X runs.
* ''HFS+ filesystem:'' Darwin also contains an implementation of the HFS+ filesystem introduced in Mac OS 8.1. It does not run on the classic Mac OS file system HFS used in in the Macintosh system software before Mac OS 8.1. HFS+, and not UFS, is the preferred filesystem for Darwin.

=== Userland ===
* ''GNU commands:'' Darwin replaces several BSD userland programs with their GNU equivalents; this makes Darwin feel more like GNU/Linux than BSD in several cases. In newer Darwin releases, GNU bash is the default shell, as it is on GNU/Linux.
* ''NetInfo:'' The NetInfo database has stored user and group information since the time of NextStep. The other *BSD systems use the traditional &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/etc/master.passwd&lt;/tt&gt; system instead. (The two files exist on Darwin, but typically do not contain normal users.)

=== Version Numbering ===
Apple labels the Darwin source code with version numbers that match Mac OS X version numbers.
* ''Jaguar:'' Darwin 6.''v'' = Mac OS 10.2.''v''
* ''Panther:'' Darwin 7.''v'' = Mac OS 10.3.''v''
* ''Tiger:'' Darwin 8.''v'' = Mac OS 10.4.''v''
* ''Leopard'': Darwin 9.''v'' = Mac OS 10.5.''v''

For example, the Darwin source code corresponding to Mac OS 10.4.3 is Darwin 8.3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{BookbindingTOC}}

Why would anyone want to bind their own books?  Here are a few answers to that question, though this list is by no means exhaustive.

==Preservation==
With the right choice of binding techniques and materials, books can survive hundreds of years of gentle use.  Even mediocre books outlive most electronic storage media: magnetic tapes and disks lose their magnetization, and optical media such as CDs and DVDs are prone to oxidation of the metallic layer and degradation of any heat-sensitive dye.  The format of the printed word is immune to trends in editing software and advances in compression protocols.  Creating printed copies can preserve digital information for the long term.

Existing printed matter can also be preserved and made more usable by proper bookbinding techniques.  If a book is damaged, replacing the binding can be a relatively straightforward process.  Brittle, decayed paper can be replaced entirely, using a photocopier and some careful planning [http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/book/index.html]; the copied book can then be placed in a more durable, permanent binding.

==Creation==
Books can be works of visual art in their own right, regardless of their content.  Hopefully, the methods in this book will introduce more artists to this practical and beautiful medium.  Also, making one's own sketchbook, journal, photo album, or notebook often serves as an inspiration to capture other forms of expression with more energy and personality.

==Convenience==
Information is easy to find on the internet, but most people find that e-books, integrated circuit spec sheets [http://caladan.nanosoft.ca/book.php], professional journal articles, and many other materials are easier to use if they are printed out and bound together.  While stapling the top corner may be appropriate for thin documents that will be kept in a file folder and read only a few times, a little extra effort produces a volume that goes comfortably from bookshelf to backpack, and can be leafed through several times a day without worrying that the outside pages will fall off.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: calander → calendar (3), under it's → under its using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">1.  Dial condition--It is very difficult to improve the appearance of most watch dials. They are designed to be protected, and anything strong enough to remove dirt is also likely to remove markings or coatings.  Sometimes spot cleaning with a toothpick can reduce some marks, but it is just as likely to make things worse.  Watch dials can be &quot;redialed&quot;--This is basically repainted.  Quality can range from very good (although rarely as good as the original) to very obviously re-painted.  Prices begin at $20 or so, not counting removing the dial and shipping. 

2.  Case condition.  If a watch is gold-tone, check edges, lugs and high spots for missing plating.  If the gold has worn off, polishing will make it look good temporarily, but the brass underneath will soon tarnish--The transition from gold to brass can bee seen with a loupe. 

3.  Movement condition.  Mechanical watches should wind and set smoothly. There should be slight resistance when setting--If there is too little resistance, make sure the minute hand moves under its own power, and if it is a calendar (or jump-hour) manually turn the watch to where the calendar starts to move, then make sure the minute hand continues to move while advancing the calendar.   The movement should be clean inside, and the balance should be turning evenly and at least half a turn. 

4.  Crown.  Fairly easy to replace, but make sure you know how much your watchmaker charges first.  Manual wind watches with worn smooth crowns are especially irritating.  

5.  Crystal--This may be important, or may be a minor problem.  If the crystal is plastic and not cracked or discolored, most scratches can be [[Plastic crystal polishing|polished]] very easily. Domed round plastic crystals and flat glass crystals usually have generic replacemnt crystals readily available.  Fancy crystals can be difficult to find a match for.

A general note - don't feel rushed to buy the first watch that comes along.  In general, if you find one specific watch online that meets your criteria, then you will find more than one.  Shop around, and get a feel for price and the range of condition that your chosen model can be found in.  A common mistake is to buy an inferior watch, and then loose money on it later when you try to sell it to fund the purchase of one in better condition that comes along.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am Timothy J Scriven, I believe wikipedia can be a powerful source for social change by simply producing the unbiased truth. I live in NSW and of 2006 I am completing my HSC. My home is terrigal, a beautiful area.  

I worry about some of the directions wikipedia has taken in relation to the NPOV policy. I believe the policy should not be used as an excuse to place material's in articles which seems sympathetic to suicide, paedophilia etc. Furthermore I believe that wikipedia should, while keeping the NPOV policy in place in some form, favour current mainstream scientific opinion. While I can understand the rationale behind the NPOV policy I think it often makes for less, not more, encylopediac articles written in the style of “Some expert’s believe that this view point is wrong because...” “However it might be noted that...” “Some have argued that...” etc, which while following the letter do not follow the spirt of the NPOV policy. 

I'm passionately committed to: 

Saving the enviorment.
The rule of law. 
Fighting the emotional, sexual, mental and physical abuse of children. 
Freedom of speech. 
Preserving human rights and making culpable before international courts those who violate them. 
The importance of internet self regulation in addition to government regulation.
Legal reform so that the legal system better addresses the problem of moral luck. 
Combating police corruption. 
Upholding the importance of analytic skills.
Analytic Philosophy.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You might have heard of [[Open_Source|Open Source]], and perhaps you have heard about Mozilla Firefox, a new web browser, or of Linux, an alternative operating system to Windows; both attempt to challenge the mainstream software provided by the likes of Microsoft and, to a lesser extent, Apple. Open Source Software is not explicitly political - it has adherents across the political spectrum - but the method of development has led a number of theorists to suggest it is applicable to other areas of life. Moreover, it has the potential to change the way we work, govern ourselves and access the media.

This is a new area of study with an unstable lexicon, however, Lawrence Lessig - a professor at Stanford Law School, has dubbed the movement 'Free Culture', a term he borrowed from Richard Stallman's Free Software. Cooperation, Sharing, Global and Knowledge are its key concepts. In its most extreme (and idealistic) form, it is a system where everyone has a equal access to knowledge and information, where society would be free to live in a world of peace, discussion, tolerance, happiness, and understanding. Yes, this is the most idealistic view and we think that it is a goal that society should have. Even many of us claim that it is not possible, but we should strive for it.

This movement is spread through different subjects, the main ones of which are:

:*[[Open Culture/Information|Information]] (e.g., Wikipedia)
:*[[Open Culture/Technology|Technology]] (Linux, Mozilla)
:*[[Open Culture/Media|Media]]  (P2P, CreativeCommons)
:*[[Open Culture/Politics|Politics]] (www.opendemocracy.net)
:*[[Open Culture/Work|Work]] (work.wikicities.com)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first subject, '''Information''', is perhaps the oldest part of this movement. Gutenberg can be considered one of its earliest advocates, since he invented the printing press, allowing the public at large to read and become educated. Today, Open Information has grown phenomenally with the internet, which allows anybody online to access an immense wealth of knowledge.

More recently there have been more or less successful attempts to centralize open knowledge. Wikipedia, for example, is an online encyclopedia where anyone can contribute, correct, or complete articles. In April 2005 it had some 538,000 articles in English (and more than 940 articles added per day), making it larger than any other encyclopedia, printed or online.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Technology''', the most visible part of the Open Culture movement can be most easily illustrated in the field of computer software and hardware.  

A branch of the Free Software movement known as Open Source software is a commonly-cited example.  As in all cases of &quot;free&quot; culture the free software and open source movements are founded on a premise whereby the user is not restricted in the use of the software.  The user is encouraged to build upon what has gone before without fear of being restricted by legal or ethical constraints.  

Many users of free software from around the world are able to contribute to the development of applications that are useful, so it is in effect not a single company that creates software for the customers but customers that contribute to making useful software for themselves  as part of a community.

The common examples include the various types of the GNU/Linux Operating System, the Mozilla suite of internet applications (Firefox, Thunderbird, Sunbird, Seamonkey, and others), and the OpenOffice.org Office Suite.  Each of those applications have significant shares in their respective markets and may pose a threat to their traditional, proprietary competitors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Media''', another area of Open Culture, includes content-sharing such as Napster, and other P2P networks. It is very recent, mainly having come with the recent development of internet. These networks allow everyone to share their photos, music and videos so that everyone has access to all the media he would like and gives his own production to everyone.

What are the incentives to produce new media if one can't get any money out of it? Some incentives include communicating one's thoughts, beliefs and knowledge. And to be sure that one's work will at least have a reference to the author, one can use licenses like the ones that Creative Commons proposes.

mankind increasingly are going to be captured by media and this is &quot;'''media imperative'''&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many different websites and groups are promoting discussions about national or international politics, these are strong actors in the open culture movement, because they want to have everyone contribute to the different subjects to advance the general knowledge. Though this has been said to be a manifestation of left wing politics.

However, politically-oriented websites tend to attract politically opinionated individuals, and, as a result, Open Culture has not been as successful in such venues as might have been anticipated. For instance, Indymedia, regarded by some as Open, is regarded by many as a failure in that deletions and IP banning is performed by a closed group, and the Open publishing is exploited by parties who might better be deleted, but are not deleted, because the deletion powers vest in the closed groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It has long been realized that Lego blocks are much more than children's toys, they are grown up's toys as well. With the introduction of Technic Lego (c) and later on Mindstorms Lego (c) Lego became much more than static modeling. It became a live, multi-dimensional simulation. With Lego we can now reproduce much more than simple models of buildings and still objects, we can now make robots and moving modules that accurately represent the world.

LEGO Design has two forms: Creative and Instructional. Instructional building is done with detailed instructions as a guide. Lego Inc. supplies building instructions with all of their products which contain details of the different uses of the parts and tips on their use in creative designing. Creative design involves building without instructions, which requires a lot more creativity and at the end is the most valued type of design.

In this guide we give many instructional designs which were produced by Lego or submitted by independent designers. Alongside are also many tips on how to produce your own successful designs using your Lego at home.

Remember, the important thing is not to make the best model or accurately reproduce reality. The most important thing is to have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Official Lego(c) instructions ==

Usually, you might start out with a LEGO set that comes in a box and includes basic pieces, special pieces, and stickers.  In the box there is a set of instructions that details every aspect of the step by step building process.  You are almost guaranteed to build something that is sleek, uniform, and closely representative of something. It is recommended that you begin with simple instructions before moving on to the more advanced instructions which are usually found in larger sets.

PAY ATTENTION! Most Lego instructions are designed as step-by-step pictures which illustrate your progress through the stages. To move on to the next stage you must identify the pieces that were added to the new picture since the last one, and add the corresponding pieces to your own model. Many times there are little changes which easily evade the eye, much of the time changes are not easily identified, and other times pieces can be misidentified causing confusion as progress continues. Always pay close attention to the development of the pictures so that you identify the small changes. Lego isn't as difficult as origami, but the lack of clear instructions can make it just as irritating.

Note that many times extra pieces are included in Lego packages, so if you find extras after you've completed the model there is no real reason to panic.

== Fan instructions ==

The amazing invention of the internet has among many, many other things permitted the millions of Lego fans to come together and share their creative inventions with each other. Once you have mastered Official Lego models it is recommended that you check out different Lego fan sites where you can find thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of different models fitting almost every kind of budget. Most of these models do not have instructions, they are unique creations, but a search for &quot;custom LEGO instructions&quot; will find many that do.after doing it with the instructions try it without the instructions to get better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The beauty of LEGO is truly revealed when you start building without instructions.  It is best to start with a large collection of standard LEGO pieces (i.e. rectangles, squares, etc.) and an assortment of speciality pieces, perhaps acquired from demolished projects that used a box kit.  A large pool of standard pieces will allow you to use the colors you want and still have enough pieces, and the speciality pieces add the occasional design function you will need to express your creative ideas.

The design process usually starts with an idea.  Visualize what you want to build.  Start with the basics.  If you want to build a house, first design the framework.  After you have a frame, add a roof, and then exterior decorations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following are things you should (or ideally should) have:
* LEGO elements. LEGO is available either in bulk packages with a variety of bricks, plates, and other elements, or as sets which can be used to build the model on the box or other creations.
* Baseplates can usually be bought individually, although some come with sets. Like their name implies, they act as a base for models and help provide support. Baseplates are most available in 32x32 and 48x48, but various sizes, colors, and shapes exist. 
* Minifigures add realism to LEGO models. They are generally included with some sets, and some special sets are released which are just minifigures and accessories. Again, consider what you want to do before purchasing.
* If you are building a Technic model, wheels, axles, and other elements are included in LEGO Technic sets. An electric motor can be purchased separately to add motion to the model.
* If necessary, sets and parts can be purchased from the LEGO company's Shop-at-Home catalog, or from various web sites that buy and sell LEGO.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several types of standard pieces, characterized and identified by the number of studs that piece contains. The &quot;studs&quot; are the little bumps on the top of almost every element in the LEGO system. A stud fits into grooves found on the bottom of almost every other element in the LEGO system. Obviously, a stud can only fit in a groove and vice versa, and so is the most basic understanding in building with LEGO.

This means that as such LEGO models can only be built &quot;one way up&quot;, but there are also special parts to work around this and allow for a variety of angular designs.

LEGO bricks are referred to by mathematical proportions much like timber; for example a &quot;2x4 brick&quot; is a brick that is 2 studs wide and four studs long. The 2x4 is the first and most common LEGO element of all. For most applications you will end up needing greater quantities of this brick than of any of the other elements.

There are two basic types of LEGO elements, &quot;bricks&quot; and &quot;plates&quot;. Put simply, bricks are the thick elements and plates are the thin ones; plates are always 1/3 of the height of a brick, so a mixture of plates and bricks can be used, but they still meet at the same height.

In special cases a plate-based part may be 2/3 of a brick, or a &quot;brick&quot; may actually be several bricks high itself, and these can allow for greater flexibility in construction.

LEGO pieces come in a wide variety of colors. Basic bricks and plates are available in around 64 colors, while some specialized elements only come in a few colors. Specialty chromed and glow-in-the-dark elements are also available, as well as transparent varieties of many of the solid colors.

Sometimes you want to build something that will not fall down if it gets bumped or dropped.  When you are building the walls of a house, for example, make sure you build it well.  Just like in a brick house, the bricks are not stacked right on top of each other.  They are staggered.  This gives strength to your building, and creates a strong foundation from which to build your creative incarnation.

Strength is important when building with LEGOs. In case it gets mis-handled while being moved or built, it might break. Hours of hard work could literally crumble away. A strong creation will last its part.

       I'd agree, it's a loan from Greek, thus from Hebrew for sure. There is just the same case in Polish- &quot;sobota&quot; from Latin Sabbatum. [[User:Kameal|Kameal]] ([[User talk:Kameal|talk]]) 20:00, 22 August 2008 (UTC)

= Impressionism =

Photography in the nineteenth century both challenged painters to be true to nature and encouraged them to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like color, that photography lacked. This divergence away from photographic realism appears in the work of a group of artists who from 1874 to 1886 exhibited together, independently of the Salon. The leaders of the independent movement were Claude Monet, August Renoir, Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, and Mary Cassatt. They became known as Impressionists because a newspaper critic thought they were painting mere sketches or impressions. The Impressionists, however, considered their works finished. 
Many Impressionists painted pleasant scenes of middle class urban life, extolling the leisure time that the industrial revolution had won for middle class society. In Renoir's luminous painting Luncheon of the Boating Party, for example, young men and women eat, drink, talk, and flirt with a joy for life that is reflected in sparkling colors. The sun filtered through the orange striped awning colors everything and everyone in the party with its warm light. The diners' glances cut across a balanced and integrated composition that reproduces a very delightful scene of modem middle class life. 

[[File:BoatingParty-PhillipsCollection-IMG 0066.jpg|thumb|Luncheon of the Boating Party by Renoir (1881)]]

Since they were realists, followers of Courbet and Manet, the Impressionists set out to be &quot;true to nature,&quot; a phrase that became their rallying cries. When Renoir and Monet went out into the countryside in search of subjects to paint, they carried their oil colors, canvas, and brushes with them so that they could stand right on the spot and record what they saw at that time. In contrast, most earlier landscape painters worked in their studio from sketches they had made outdoors. 
The more an Impressionist like Monet looked, the more she or he saw. Sometimes Monet came back to the same spot at different times of day or at a different time of year to paint the same scene. In 1892 he rented a room opposite the Cathedral of Rouen in order to paint its facade over and over again. He never copied himself because the light and color always changed with the passage of time, and the variations made each painting a new creation. The differences are obvious when we compare the painting of Rouen Cathedral that is now in Switzerland with the one that is now in Washington, D.C. 
Realism meant to an Impressionist that the painter ought to record the most subtle sensations of reflected light. In capturing a specific kind of light, this style conveys the notion of a specific and fleeting moment of time. Impressionist painters like Monet and Renoir recorded each sensation of light with a touch of paint in a little stroke like a comma. The public back then was upset that Impressionist paintings looked like a sketch and did not have the polish and finish that more fashionable paintings had. But applying the paint in tiny strokes allowed Monet, Renoir, or Cassatt to display color sensations openly, to keep the colors unmixed and intense, and to let the viewer's eye mix the colors. The bright colors and the active participation of the viewer approximated the experience of the scintillation of natural sunlight. 
The Impressionists remained realists in the sense that they remained true to their sensations of the object, although they ignored many of the old conventions for representing the object &quot;out there.&quot; But truthfulness for the Impressionists lay in their personal and subjective sensations not in the &quot;exact&quot; reproduction of an object for its own sake. The objectivity of things existing outside and beyond the artist no longer mattered as much as it once did. The significance of &quot;outside&quot; objects became irrelevant. Concern for representing an object faded, while concern for representing the subjective grew. The focus on subjectivity intensified because artists became more concerned with the independent expression of the individual. Reality became what the individual saw. With Impressionism, the meaning of realism was transformed into subjective realism, and the subjectivity of modem art was born.

==Camille Pissarro (1830-1903)==
 
Born July 10, 1830 in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. His father, a Portuguese Jew, ran a general store. Although Pissarro attended school in Paris and demonstrated an exceptional talent for drawing, he returned to St. Thomas in 1847 to work in the family business. During the ensuing years his interest in art persisted, and in 1855 his parents finally yielded to his ambition to become a painter. 

Pissarro reached Paris in time to see the important World's Fair of 1855. He was particularly impressed by the landscapes of Camille Corot and other members of the Barbizon group, who had taken the first steps toward working directly from nature, and by the ambitious and forthright realism of Gustave Courbet, although his own work increasingly gravitated toward landscape rather than figurative subjects.

During the next 10 years, Pissarro received some academic training at the École des Beaux-Arts, but he spent most of his time at the Académie Suisse, where free classes were offered. This was an important gathering place for those artists whose ambitions and sensibilities lay outside the teaching of the official schools, for it offered greater opportunity to discuss and develop personal ideas about painting and art in general. In this setting Pissarro became friends with Claude Monet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Paul Cézanne, who were seeking alternatives to the established methods of painting. Pissarro's works at this time were occasionally, though by no means consistently, accepted at the annual Salons. More importantly, however, he received critical backing and encouragement from the journalist and critic Émile Zola.
 
During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-7, Pissarro and Monet went to London, where they were impressed by the landscape paintings of John Constable and J.M.W. Turner. By this time Pissarro and Monet had begun to work directly from nature and to develop the unique style that would later be called Impressionism. In their pursuit of this new and revolutionary direction, the lessons of the earlier English landscapists provided crucial and much-needed support, particularly in terms of the loose handling of paint, the abstractness, and the strong response to nature that characterized their own paintings. When Pissarro returned to his home at Louveciennes near Paris, he found that the Prussians had destroyed nearly all of his paintings. 

By the early 1870s, the work of Pissarro and his colleagues had been rejected by the Salon, France's official state-run art show, on repeated occasions. In 1874, they held their own exhibition, a show of &quot;independent&quot; artists, which included the work of Pissarro, Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Edgar Degas, and Berthe Morisot. This was the first Impressionist exhibition (the term &quot;Impressionist,&quot; originally used derisively, was actually coined by a newspaper critic). There were seven similar exhibitions from 1874-86, and Pissarro was the only artist who participated in all eight. This fact is important because it reveals something about Pissarro's relation to Impressionism generally: he was the patriarch and teacher of the movement, constantly advising younger artists, introducing them to one another, and encouraging them to join the revolutionary trend that he helped to originate. 
In 1892, a large retrospective of Pissarro's work finally brought him the international recognition he deserved. Characteristic paintings are Path through the Fields (1879), Landscape, Eragny (1895), and Place du Théâtre Français (1898). He died in Paris on November 12, 1903. Although his work was generally less innovative than that of his major contemporaries, his contributions as an artist should not be underestimated in the development of the Impressionist painting style.


==Edgar Degas (1834-1917)==

Born Hilaire-Germain-Edgar Degas on July 19, 1834, in Paris, France. A member of an upper-class family (his father was a banker), Degas was originally intended to practice law, which he studied for a time after finishing secondary school. In 1855, however, he enrolled at the famous École des Beaux-Arts, or School of Fine Arts, in Paris, where he studied under Louis Lamothe, a pupil of the classical painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. 
In order to supplement his art studies, Degas traveled extensively, including trips to Naples, Florence, and Rome (where he lived for three years), in order to observe and copy the works of such Renaissance masters as Sandro Botticelli, Andrea Mantegna, and Nicolas Poussin. From his early classical education, Degas learned a good deal about drawing figures, a skill he used to complete some impressive family portraits before 1860, notably The Belleli Family (1859). 
In 1861, Degas returned to Paris, where he executed several &quot;history paintings,&quot; or works with historical or Biblical themes, which were then the most sought-after paintings by serious art patrons and particularly the prestigious state-run art show, the Salon, held each year in Paris. He also began copying works by the Old Masters from the Louvre, which he would continue doing for many years. With his historical paintings (including 1861's Daughter of Jephthah, based on an incident from the Old Testament) and his finely-wrought portraits of friends, family members, and clients, the young Degas quickly established a reputation among French art circles and never suffered from the financial problems that plagued many of his contemporaries. 

[[File:Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas 021.jpg|thumb|right|''The Dance Class'' (La Classe de Danse)  by Edgar Degas (1873–1876)]]

Soon, however, Degas began to shift his focus from historical painting to depictions of life in contemporary Paris. By 1862, he had begun painting various scenes from the racecourse, including studies of the horses, their mounts, and the fashionable spectators. Degas' style after the early 1860s was influenced by the budding Impressionist movement, including his friendship with Édouard Manet, as well as his introduction to Japanese graphic art, with its striking representation of figures. Along with his work painting scenes from the racetrack, Degas began concentrating on portraits of groups, most notably of female ballet dancers, who became Degas' most famous subjects.
Degas served in the artillery division of the French National Guard during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. Upon his return, he worked on even more ambitious studies of groups, often in motion, in both indoor and outdoor settings. In October 1872, Degas visited the United States for five months, spending time in New Orleans, Louisiana, where some members of his family were in the cotton business. From this experience came his famous painting New Orleans Cotton Office (1873).

Many of Degas' paintings featured the artist's experiments with unorthodox visual angles and asymmetrical perspectives, somewhat like a photographer's treatment of a subject. Examples of this style are A Carriage at the Races (1872), which features a human figure who is almost cut in half by the edge of the canvas, and Ballet Rehearsal (1876), a group portrait of ballerinas that appears almost cropped at the edges. From 1873 to 1883, Degas produced many of his most famous works, both paintings and pastels, of his favorite subjects, including the ballet, the racecourse, the music hall, and café society. 
Though he never suffered from lack of money or interest in his work, Degas stopped exhibiting at the Salon in 1874, and thereafter displayed most of his works alongside those of the other Impressionists, including Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, Berthe Morisot, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Camille Pissarro. His strong focus on draftsmanship, portraiture, and composition distanced him from the rest of the artists identified as Impressionists.

Sometime in the 1870s, Degas began to suffer a loss of vision, which limited his ability to work. He began increasingly to work as a sculptor, producing bronze statues of horses and ballet dancers, among other subjects. A number of his sculptures, including Little Dancer Aged Fourteen (1880-81), were figures dressed in real costumes, and many of them captured the moment of transition between one position to another, giving the statues a real sense of immediacy and motion.
As Degas' eyesight grew worse, he became an increasingly reclusive and eccentric figure. In the last years of his life, he was almost totally blind. Edgar Degas died on September 27, 1917, in Paris, leaving behind in his studio an important collection of drawings and paintings by his contemporaries as well as a number of statues crafted in wax and metal, which were cast in bronze after his death.

==Claude Monet (1840-1926)==

Born November 14, 1840, in Paris, France. Claude Monet was a seminal figure in the evolution of Impressionism, a pivotal style in the development of modern art. In 1845 his family moved to Le Havre, and by the time he was 15, Monet had developed a local reputation as a caricaturist. Through an exhibition of his caricatures in 1858, Monet met Eugène Boudin, a landscape painter who exerted a profound influence on the young artist. Boudin introduced him to outdoor painting, an activity that he entered reluctantly but which soon became the basis for his life's work. 
By 1859 Monet was determined to pursue an artistic career. He visited Paris and was impressed by the paintings of Eugène Delacroix, Charles Daubigny, and Camille Corot. Against his parents' wishes, Monet decided to stay in Paris. He worked at the free Académie Suisse, where he met Camille Pissarro, and he frequented the Brasserie des Martyrs, a gathering place for Gustave Courbet and other realists who constituted the vanguard of French painting in the 1850s. 
Formative Period

Monet's studies were interrupted by military service in Algeria from 1860 to 1862. The remainder of the decade witnessed constant experimentation, travel, and the formation of many important artistic friendships. In 1862, he entered the studio of Charles Gleyre in Paris and met Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Frédéric Bazille. During 1863 and 1864, he periodically worked in the forest at Fontainebleau with the Barbizon artists Théodore Rousseau, Jean François Millet, and Daubigny, as well as with Corot. In Paris in 1869, he frequented the Café Guerbois, where he met Édouard Manet. 
At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Monet traveled to London, where he met the adventurous and sympathetic dealer Paul Durand-Ruel. The following year Monet and his wife, Camille, whom he had married in 1870, settled at Argenteuil, which became a semi-permanent home (he continued to travel throughout his life) for the next six years. 
Monet's constant movements during this period were directly related to his artistic ambitions. The phenomena of natural light, atmosphere, and color captivated his imagination, and he committed himself to an increasingly accurate recording of their enthralling variety. He consciously sought that variety and gradually developed a remarkable sensitivity for the subtle particulars of each landscape he encountered. Paul Cézanne is reported to have said, &quot;Monet is the most prodigious eye since there have been painters.&quot; 
Relatively few of Monet's canvases from the 1860s have survived. Throughout the decade, and during the 1870s as well, he suffered from extreme financial hardship and frequently destroyed his own paintings rather than have them seized by creditors. A striking example of his early style is Terrace at Sainte-Adresse (1867). The painting contains a shimmering array of bright, natural colors, eschewing completely the somber browns and blacks of the earlier landscape tradition. 

===Monet and Impressionism===
 
As William Seitz wrote in 1960, &quot;The landscapes Monet painted at Argenteuil between 1872 and 1877 are his best-known, most popular works, and it was during these years that Impressionism most closely approached a group style. Here, often working beside Renoir, Sisley, Caillebotte, or Manet, he painted the sparkling impressions of French river life that so delight us today.&quot; During these same years, Monet exhibited regularly in the Impressionist group shows, the first of which took place in 1874. On that occasion his painting Impression: Sunrise (1872) inspired a hostile newspaper critic to call all the artists &quot;Impressionists,&quot; and the designation has persisted to the present day. 

[[File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant, 1872.jpg|thumb|Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant) by Monet (1872)]]

Monet's paintings from the 1870s reveal the major tenets of the Impressionist vision. Along with Impression: Sunrise, Red Boats at Argenteuil (1875) is an outstanding example of the new style. In these paintings, Impressionism is essentially an illusionist style, albeit one that looks radically different from the landscapes of the Old Masters. The difference resides primarily in the chromatic vibrancy of Monet's canvases. Working directly from nature, he and the other Impressionists discovered that even the darkest shadows and the gloomiest days contain an infinite variety of colors. To capture the fleeting effects of light and color, however, Monet gradually learned that he had to paint quickly and to employ short brushstrokes loaded with individualized colors. This technique resulted in canvases that were charged with painterly activity; in effect, they denied the even blending of colors and the smooth, enameled surfaces to which earlier painting had persistently subscribed. 

Yet, in spite of these differences, the new style was illusionistically intended; only the interpretation of what illusionism consisted of had changed. For traditional landscape artists, illusionism was conditioned first of all by the mind: that is, painters tended to depict the individual phenomena of the natural world-leaves, branches, blades of grass-as they had studied them and conceptualized their existence. Monet, on the other hand, wanted to paint what he saw rather than what he intellectually knew. And he saw not separate leaves, but splashes of constantly changing light and color. According to Seitz, &quot;It is in this context that we must understand his desire to see the world through the eyes of a man born blind who had suddenly gained his sight: as a pattern of nameless color patches.&quot; In an important sense, then, Monet belongs to the tradition of Renaissance illusionism: in recording the phenomena of the natural world, he simply based his art on perceptual rather than conceptual knowledge. 

During the 1880s, the Impressionists began to dissolve as a cohesive group, although individual members continued to see one another and they occasionally worked together. In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny, but he continued to travel-to London, Madrid, and Venice, as well as to favorite sites in his native country. He gradually gained critical and financial success during the late 1880s and the 1890s. This was due primarily to the efforts of Durand-Ruel, who sponsored one-man exhibitions of Monet's work as early as 1883 and who, in 1886, also organized the first large-scale Impressionist group show to take place in the United States. 

Monet's painting during this period slowly gravitated toward a broader, more expansive and expressive style. In Spring Trees by a Lake (1888) the entire surface vibrates electrically with shimmering light and color. Paradoxically, as his style matured and as he continued to develop the sensitivity of his vision, the strictly illusionistic aspect of his paintings began to disappear. Plastic form dissolved into colored pigment, and three-dimensional space evaporated into a charged, purely optical surface atmosphere. His canvases, although invariably inspired by the visible world, increasingly declared themselves as objects that are, above all, paintings. This quality links Monet's art more closely with modernism than with the Renaissance tradition.

Modernist, too, are the &quot;serial&quot; paintings to which Monet devoted considerable energy during the 1890s. The most celebrated of these series are the haystacks (1891) and the façades of Rouen Cathedral (1892-1894). In these works Monet painted his subjects from more or less the same physical position, allowing only the natural light and atmospheric conditions to vary from picture to picture. That is, he &quot;fixed&quot; the subject matter, treating it like an experimental constant against which changing effects could be measured and recorded. This technique reflects the persistence and devotion with which Monet pursued his study of the visible world. At the same time, the serial works effectively neutralized subject matter per se, implying that paintings could exist without it. In this way his art established an important precedent for the development of abstract painting.

===Late Work===
 
Monet's wife died in 1879; in 1892 he married Alice Hoschedé. By 1899 his financial position was secure, and he began work on his famous series of water lily paintings. Water lilies existed in profusion in the artist's exotic gardens at Giverny, and he painted them tirelessly until his death there on December 5, 1926. Monet's late years were by no means easy. During his last two decades, he suffered from poor health and had double cataracts; by the 1920s, he was virtually blind. 
In addition to his physical ailments, Monet struggled desperately with the problems of his art. In 1920, he began work on 12 large canvases (each measuring 14 feet in width) of water lilies, which he planned to give to the state. To complete them, he fought against his own failing eyesight and against the demands of a large-scale mural art for which his own past had hardly prepared him. In effect, the task required him to learn a new kind of painting at the age of 80. The paintings are characterized by a broad, sweeping style; virtually devoid of subject matter, their vast, encompassing spaces are generated almost exclusively by color. Such color spaces were without precedent in Monet's lifetime; and moreover, their descendants have appeared in contemporary painting only since the end of World War II. 

==Berthe Morisot (1841-1895)==

[[File:Edouard Manet 040.jpg|thumb|Berthe Morisot with a Bouquet of Violets by Manet (1872)]]

Born January 14, 1841, in Bourges, France. The daughter of a high-ranking government official and granddaughter of the influential Rococo painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Morisot began studying painting alongside her sister Edma when both were young. Though women were not allowed to join official arts institutions, like schools, until the last few years of the nineteenth century, Morisot and her sister earned a certain measure of respect within art circles for their budding talent. 
After copying masterpieces from the Louvre Museum in the late 1850s under Joseph Guichard, Berthe and Edma began painting outdoor scenes while studying with the well-known landscape painter Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot. Berthe Morisot worked with Corot, who became a family friend, from 1862 to 1868. She first exhibited her paintings at the prestigious state-run art show, the Salon, in 1864, and her work was shown there regularly for the next decade..

Morisot was greatly influenced by her friendship with Édouard Manet, to whom she was introduced in 1868 by their fellow artist Henri Fantin-Latour. Though Morisot was never a pupil of Manet's, she soon abandoned aspects of Corot's teachings and destroyed almost all of her early work in favor of a more unconventional and modern approach, with the encouragement of Manet and others, including Edgar Degas and Frédéric Bazille. She also played an important role in Manet's career, posing for a number of his paintings-notably The Balcony (1869) and Repose (c. 1870) - and encouraging him to adapt some tenets of Impressionism into his work.
 
 
Beginning in 1874, Morisot refused to show her work at the Salon, choosing to join a fledgling group of Impressionist painters that included Degas, who would become Morisot's lifelong friend, as well as Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet, and Alfred Sisley. Morisot agreed to take part in the first independent exhibition of Impressionist paintings, which opened in a photographer's studio on Paris's Boulevard des Capucines in April 1874. In doing so, she went against the advice of Édouard Manet, who refused to exhibit with the Impressionists and was determined to make his name at the Salon. Among the paintings she showed at the exhibition were The Cradle, The Harbor at Cherbourg, Hide and Seek, and Reading. 
In December 1874, at the age of 33, Morisot married Manet's younger brother, Eugène, also a painter. Eugène Manet supported his wife in her work and the marriage gave Morisot social and financial stability while she continued her painting career. On a census form, Morisot famously recorded herself as &quot;without profession,&quot; underscoring her vision of her life and work within, not outside of, the traditional feminine sphere. She participated in all of the Impressionist exhibitions save one, in 1877, when she was pregnant with her daughter, Julie, born in 1878. 

Morisot painted in oils, watercolors, and pastels, and produced numerous drawings. Her wide range of subjects included portraits (many of her sister Edma), landscapes, still lives, and the domestic scene, particularly traditional feminine occupations. A particularly notable example of the latter was Woman at Her Toilette (c. 1879), which she displayed in the fifth Impressionist exhibition in 1880. For some of her later works, Morisot noticeably changed her style, making numerous sketches of a subject before beginning a painting rather than relying on spontaneous observation, as in her earlier work. Paintings that showcased her new style included The Cherry Tree (1891-92) and Girl with a Greyhound (1893).
Eugène Manet died in April 1892, after a long illness. Morisot's friends and fellow artists rallied around her and her young daughter Julie, and she continued to work. Though never commercially successful during her lifetime, Morisot outsold several of her fellow Impressionists, including Monet, Renoir, and Sisley. She had her first solo exhibition in 1892 at the Boussod and Valadon gallery, where she sold a number of works, and she earned further recognition in 1894, when the French government purchased her oil painting Young Woman in a Ball Gown.
In the winter of 1894-95, Morisot contracted pneumonia. She died on March 2, 1895, at the age of 54. After her death, Renoir and Degas organized a retrospective of her work, which garnered serious critical acclaim and ensured her place in art history as one of the founding members of the revolutionary Impressionist movement.

==Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919)==
 
Born February 25, 1841, in Limoges, France. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to Paris. Because he showed a remarkable talent for drawing, Renoir became an apprentice in a porcelain factory, where he painted plates. Later, after the factory had gone out of business, he worked for his older brother, decorating fans. Throughout these early years, Renoir made frequent visits to the Louvre, where he studied the art of earlier French masters, particularly those of the 18th century-Antoine Watteau, François Boucher, and Jean Honoré Fragonard. His deep respect for these artists informed his own painting throughout his career. 
During the 1870s, a revolution erupted in French painting. Encouraged by artists like Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet, a number of young painters began to seek alternatives to the traditions of Western painting that had prevailed since the beginning of the Renaissance. These artists went directly to nature for their inspiration and into the actual society of which they were a part. As a result, their works revealed a look of freshness and immediacy that in many ways departed from the look of Old Master painting. The new art, for instance, displayed vibrant light and color instead of the somber browns and blacks that had dominated previous painting. These qualities, among others, signaled the beginning of modern art. 

==Early Career==
In 1862, Renoir decided to study painting seriously and entered the Atelier Gleyre, where he met Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Jean Frédéric Bazille. During the next six years, Renoir's art showed the influence of Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet, the two most innovative painters of the 1850s and 1860s. Courbet's influence is especially evident in the bold palette-knife technique of Diane Chasseresse (1867), while Manet's can be seen in the flat tones of Alfred Sisley and His Wife (1868). Still, both paintings reveal a sense of intimacy that is characteristic of Renoir's personal style. 
 
The 1860s were difficult years for Renoir. At times he was too poor to buy paints or canvas, and the Salons of 1866 and 1867 rejected his works. The following year the Salon accepted his painting Lise. He continued to develop his work and to study the paintings of his contemporaries-not only Courbet and Manet, but Camille Corot and Eugène Delacroix as well. Renoir's indebtedness to Delacroix is apparent in the lush painter like that of the Odalisque (1870). 
Renoir and Impressionism
In 1869, Renoir and Monet worked together at La Grenouillère, a bathing spot on the Seine. Both artists became obsessed with painting light and water. According to Phoebe Pool (1967), this was a decisive moment in the development of Impressionism, for &quot;It was there that Renoir and Monet made their discovery that shadows are not brown or black but are colored by their surroundings, and that the 'local color' of an object is modified by the light in which it is seen, by reflections from other objects and by contrast with juxtaposed colors.&quot; 
The styles of Renoir and Monet were virtually identical at this time, an indication of the dedication with which they pursued and shared their new discoveries. During the 1870s, they still occasionally worked together, although their styles generally developed in more personal directions. 
In 1874, Renoir participated in the first Impressionist exhibition, along with Monet, Edgar Degas, Alfred Sisley, Camille Pissarro, and Berthe Morisot. His works included The Opera Box (1874), a painting that shows the artist's penchant for rich and freely handled figurative expression. Of all the Impressionists, Renoir most consistently and thoroughly adapted the new style-in its inspiration, essentially a landscape style-to the great tradition of figure painting. 

Although the Impressionist exhibitions were the targets of much public ridicule during the 1870s, Renoir's patronage gradually increased during the decade. He became a friend of Caillebotte, one of the first patrons of the Impressionists, and he was also backed by the art dealer Durand-Ruel and by collectors like Victor Choquet, the Charpentiers, and the Daidets. The artist's connection with these individuals is documented by a number of handsome portraits, for instance, Madame Charpentier and Her Children (1878).
 
In the 1870s, Renoir also produced some of his most celebrated Impressionist genre scenes, including The Swing and The Ball at the Moulin de la Galette (both 1876). These works embody his most basic attitudes about art and life. They show men and women together, openly and casually enjoying a society diffused with warm, radiant sunlight. Figures blend softly into one another and into their surrounding space. Such worlds are pleasurable, sensuous, and generously endowed with human feeling. 

===Renoir's &quot;Dry&quot; Period===

During the 1880s, Renoir gradually separated himself from the other Impressionists, largely because he became dissatisfied with the direction the new style was taking in his own hands. In paintings like The Luncheon of the Boating Party (1881), he felt that his style was becoming too loose, that forms were losing their distinctiveness and sense of mass. As a result, he looked to the past for a fresh inspiration. In 1881, he traveled to Italy and was particularly impressed by the art of Raphael. 
During the next six years, Renoir's paintings became increasingly dry: he began to draw in a tight, classical manner, carefully outlining his figures in an effort to give them plastic clarity. The works from this period, such as The Umbrellas (1883) and Les grandes baigneuses (1884-1887), are generally considered the least successful of Renoir's mature expressions. Their classicizing effort seems self-conscious, a contradiction to the warm sensuality that came naturally to him. 

===Late Career===
By the end of the 1880s, Renoir had passed through his dry period. His late work is truly extraordinary: a glorious outpouring of monumental nude figures, beautiful young girls, and lush landscapes. Examples of this style include The Music Lesson (1891), Young Girl Reading (1892), and Sleeping Bather (1897). In many ways, the generosity of feeling in these paintings expands upon the achievements of his great work in the 1870s. 
Renoir's health declined severely in his later years. In 1903, he suffered his first attack of rheumatoid arthritis and settled for the winter at Cagnes-sur-Mer. By this time he faced no financial problems, but the arthritis made painting painful and often impossible. Nevertheless, he continued to work, at times with a brush tied to his crippled hand. Renoir died at Cagnes-sur-Mer on December 3, 1919, but his death was preceded by an experience of supreme triumph: the state had purchased his portrait Madame Georges Charpentier (1877), and he traveled to Paris in August to see it hanging in the Louvre.

==Edouard Manet (1832-1883)==
 
Born January 23, 1832 in Paris, France, to Auguste Édouard Manet, an official at the Ministry of Justice, and Eugénie Désirée Manet. Manet's father, who had expected his son to study law, vigorously opposed his wish to become a painter. The career of naval officer was decided upon as a compromise, and at the age of 16 Édouard sailed to Rio de Janeiro on a training vessel. Upon his return he failed to pass the entrance examination of the naval academy. His father relented, and in 1850 Manet entered the studio of Thomas Couture, where, in spite of many disagreements with his teacher, he remained until 1856. During this period, Manet traveled abroad and made numerous copies after the Old Masters in both foreign and French public collections. 
Early Works
Manet's entry for the Salon of 1859, The Absinthe Drinker, a thematically romantic but conceptually daring work, was rejected. At the Salon of 1861, his Spanish Singer, one of a number of works of Spanish character painted in this period, not only was admitted to the Salon but won an honorable mention and the acclaim of the poet Théophile Gautier. This was to be Manet's last success for many years. 

[[File:Edouard Manet 024.jpg|Edouard Manet 024|thumb|Le déjeuner sur l'herbe by Manet (1863)]]
 
In 1863, Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff, a Dutch pianist. That year he showed 14 paintings at the Martinet Gallery; one of them, Music in the Tuileries, remarkable for its freshness in the handling of a contemporary scene, was greeted with considerable hostility. Also in 1863, the Salon rejected Manet's large painting Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe, or Luncheon on the Grass, and the artist elected to have it shown at the now famous Salon des Refusés, created by the emperor under the pressure of the exceptionally large number of painters whose work had been turned away. Here, Manet's picture attracted the most attention and brought forth a kind of abusive criticism that was to set a pattern for years to come. 

In 1865, Manet's Olympia produced a still more violent reaction at the official Salon, and his reputation as a renegade became widespread. Upset by the criticism, Manet made a brief trip to Spain, where he admired many works by Diego Velázquez, to whom he referred as &quot;the painter of painters.&quot; 

===Support of Baudelaire and Zola===
Manet's close friend and supporter during the early years was Charles Baudelaire, who, in 1862, had written a quatrain to accompany one of Manet's Spanish subjects, Lola de Valence, and the public, largely as a result of the strange atmosphere of the Olympia, linked the two men readily. In 1866, after the Salon jury had rejected two of Manet's works, Émile Zola came to his defense with a series of articles filled with strongly expressed, uncompromising praise. In 1867, he published a book that contains the prediction, &quot;Manet's place is destined to be in the Louvre.&quot; This book appears on Zola's desk in Manet's portrait of the writer (1868). In May of that year, the Paris World's Fair opened its doors, and Manet, at his own expense, exhibited 50 of his works in a temporary structure, not far from Gustave Courbet's private exhibition. This was in keeping with Manet's view, expressed years later to his friend Antonin Proust, that his paintings must be seen together in order to fully understand. 
 
Although Manet insisted that a painter be &quot;resolutely of his own time&quot; and that he paint what he sees, he nevertheless produced two important religious works, Dead Christ with Angels and Christ Mocked by the Soldiers, which were shown at the Salons of 1864 and 1865, respectively, and ridiculed. Only Zola could defend the former work on the grounds of its vigorous realism while playing down its alleged lack of piety. It is also true that although Manet despised the academic category of &quot;history painting&quot; he did paint the contemporary Naval Battle between the Kearsarge and the Alabama (1864) and The Execution of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (1867). The latter is based upon a careful gathering of the facts surrounding the incident and composed, largely, after Francisco Goya's Executions of the Third of May, resulting in a curious amalgam of the particular and the universal. Manet's use of older works of art in elaborating his own major compositions has long been, and continues to be, a problematic subject, since the old view that this procedure was needed to compensate for the artist's own inadequate imagination is rapidly being discarded. 

===Late Works===
Although Manet influenced the Impressionists during the 1860s, during the next decade it appears that it was he who learned from them. His palette became lighter; his stroke, without ever achieving the analytical intensity of Claude Monet's, was shorter and more rapid. Nevertheless, Manet never cultivated plein-airism seriously, and he remained essentially a figure and studio painter. Also, despite his sympathy for most of the Impressionists with whom the public associated him, he never exhibited with them at their series of private exhibitions, which began in 1874. He was particularly close to the female Impressionist Berthe Morisot, whom he met in 1868. Manet was a great influence on Morisot, and she in turn helped him accept some of the tenets of Impressionism to greater effect in his work; she also posed for him numerous times, notably for The Balcony (1869) and Repose (c. 1870). In 1874, Morisot married Manet's younger brother, Eugéne, also a painter. 
Manet had his first resounding success since The Spanish Singer at the Salon of 1873 with his Bon Bock, which radiates a touch and joviality of expression reminiscent of Frans Hals, in contrast to Manet's usually austere figures. In spite of the popularity of this painting, his success was not to extend to the following season. About this time he met the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, with whom he remained on intimate terms for the remainder of his life. After Manet's rejection by the jury in 1876, Mallarmé took up his defense. 

[[File:Edouard Manet 004.jpg|thumb|Edouard Manet 004|thumb|right|Le Bar des Folies-Bergère by Manet (1881-1882)]]
 
Toward the end of the 1870s, although Manet retained the bright palette and the touch of his Impressionist works, he returned to the figure problems of the early years. The undeniable sense of mystery is found again in several bar scenes, notably the Brasserie Reichshoffen, in which the relationships of the figures recall those of Luncheon on the Grass. Perhaps the apotheosis of his lifelong endeavors is to be found in his last major work, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère (1881-1882). Here, in the expression of the barmaid, is all the starkness of the great confrontations of the 1860s, but bathed in a profusion of colors. While we are drawn to the brilliantly painted accessories, it is the girl, placed at the center before a mirror, which dominates the composition and ultimately demands our attention. Although her reflected image, showing her to be in conversation with a man, is absorbed into the brilliant atmosphere of the setting, she remains enigmatic and aloof. Manet produced two aspects of the same personality, combined the fleeting with the eternal, and, by &quot;misplacing&quot; the reflected image, took a step toward abstraction as a solution to certain lifelong philosophical and technical problems. 
In 1881, Manet was finally admitted to membership in the Legion of Honor, an award he had long coveted. By then he was seriously ill. Therapy at the sanatorium at Bellevue failed to improve his health, and walking became increasingly difficult for him. In his weakened condition he found it easier to handle pastels than oils, and he produced a great many flower pieces and portraits in that medium. In the spring of 1883, his left leg was amputated, but this did not prolong his life. He died peacefully in Paris on April 30. 
Manet was short, unusually handsome, and witty. His biographers stress his kindness and unaffected generosity toward his friends. The paradoxical elements in his art are an extension of the man: although a revolutionary in art, he craved official honors; while fashionably dressed, he affected a Parisian slang at odds with his appearance and impeccable manners; and although he espoused the style of life of the conservative classes, his political sentiments were those of the republican liberal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes, the built in string functions are not the most convenient or elegant solution to the problem at hand. If the task involves manipulating complicated patterns of characters, ''regular expressions'' can be a more effective tool than sequences of simple string functions.

Visual Basic has no built-in support for regular expressions. It can use regular expressions via VBScript Regular Expression Library, though. If you have Internet Explorer installed, you almost certainly have the library. To use it, you must add a reference to the project; on the ''Project'' menu choose ''References'' and scroll down to ''Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions''. There might be more than one version; if so, choose the one with the highest version number, unless you have some particular reason to choose an old version, such as compatibility with that version on another machine.

==Class outline==
Class outline of VBScript.RegExp class:
* Attributes
** RegExp.Pattern
** RegExp.Global
** RegExp.IgnoreCase
** RegExp.MultiLine
* Methods
** RegExp.Test
** RegExp.Replace
** RegExp.Execute

==Constructing a regexp==

A method of constructing a regular expression object:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;[0-9][0-9]*&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

A method of constructing a regular expression object that requires that, in Excel, you set a reference to Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = new RegExp
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;[0-9][0-9]*&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Testing for match==

An example of testing for match of a regular expression
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set RegExp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   RegExp.Pattern = &quot;[0-9][0-9]*&quot;
   If RegExp.Test(&quot;354647&quot;) Then
     MsgBox &quot;Test 1 passed.&quot;
   End If
   If RegExp.Test(&quot;a354647&quot;) Then
     MsgBox &quot;Test 2 passed.&quot; 'This one passes, as the matching is not a whole-string one
   End If
   If RegExp.Test(&quot;abc&quot;) Then
     MsgBox &quot;Test 3 passed.&quot; 'This one does not pass
   End If
&lt;/source&gt;

An example of testing for match in which the whole string has to match:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set RegExp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   RegExp.Pattern = &quot;^[0-9][0-9]*$&quot;
   If RegExp.Test(&quot;354647&quot;) Then
     MsgBox &quot;Test 1 passed.&quot;
   End If
   If RegExp.Test(&quot;a354647&quot;) Then
     MsgBox &quot;Test 2 passed.&quot; 'This one does not pass
   End If
&lt;/source&gt;

==Finding matches==
An example of iterating through the collection of all the matches of a regular expression in a string:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;a.*?z&quot;
   Regexp.Global = True 'Without global, only the first match is found
   Set Matches = Regex.Execute(&quot;aaz abz acz ad1z&quot;)
   For Each Match In Matches
     MsgBox &quot;A match: &quot; &amp; Match
   Next
&lt;/source&gt;

==Finding groups==
An example of accessing matched groups:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;(a*) *(b*)&quot;
   Regexp.Global = True
   Set Matches = Regexp.Execute(&quot;aaa bbb&quot;)
   For Each Match In Matches
     FirstGroup = Match.SubMatches(0) '=aaa
     SecondGroup = Match.SubMatches(1) '=bbb
   Next
&lt;/source&gt;

==Replacing==

An example of replacing all sequences of dashes with a single dash:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;--*&quot;
   Regexp.Global = True
   Result = Regexp.Replace(&quot;A-B--C----D&quot;, &quot;-&quot;) '=&quot;A-B-C-D&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

An example of replacing doubled strings with their single version with the use of two sorts of ''backreference'':

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;(.*)\1&quot;
   Regexp.Global = True
   Result = Regexp.Replace(&quot;hellohello&quot;, &quot;$1&quot;) '=&quot;hello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Splitting==
There is no direct support for splitting by a regular expression, but there is a workaround. If you can assume that the split string does not contain Chr(1), you can first replace the separator regular expression with Chr(1), and then use the non-regexp split function on Chr(1).

An example of splitting by a non-zero number of spaces:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  SplitString = &quot;a b  c   d&quot;
  Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
  Regexp.Pattern = &quot;  *&quot;
  Regexp.Global = True
  Result = Regexp.Replace(SplitString , Chr(1))
  SplitArray = Split(Result, Chr(1))
  For Each Element In SplitArray
    MsgBox Element 
  Next
&lt;/source&gt;

==Example application==

For many beginning programmers, the ideas behind regular expressions are so foreign that it might be worth presenting a simple example before discussing the theory. The example given is in fact the beginning of an application for scraping web pages to retrieve source code so it is relevant too.

Imagine that you need to parse a web page to pick up the major headings and the content to which the headings refer.  Such a web page might look like this:

[[Image:Visual Basic Classic RegExp Example Web Page.png|frame]]

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;RegEx Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;RegEx Example&lt;/h1&gt;
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        &lt;h2&gt;Level Two in RegEx Example&lt;/h2&gt;
          bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
      &lt;h1&gt;Level One&lt;/h1&gt;
        cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
        &lt;h2&gt;Level Two in Level One&lt;/h2&gt;
          dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

What we want to do is extract the text in the two ''h1 elements'' and all the text between the first ''h1'' and the second ''h1'' as well as all the text between the second ''h1 element'' and the end of body tag.

We could store the results in an array that looks like this:

{|
|-
|&quot;RegEx Example&quot;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n&lt;h2&gt;Level Two in RegEx Example&lt;/h2&gt;\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
|-
|&quot;Level One&quot;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;     cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\n&lt;h2&gt;Level Two in Level One&lt;/h2&gt;\n
          dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|}

The ''\n'' character sequences represent end of line marks.  These could be any of ''carriage return'', ''line feed'' or ''carriage return'' followed by ''line feed''.

A regular expression specifies patterns of characters to be matched and the result of the matching process is a list of sub-strings that match either the whole expression or some parts of the expression.  An expression that does what we want might look like this:
  &lt;nowiki&gt;
  &quot;&lt;h1&gt;\s*([\s\S]*?)\s*&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
  &lt;/nowiki&gt;
Actually it doesn't quite do it but it is close.  The result is a collection of matches in an object of type ''MatchCollection'':
  &lt;nowiki&gt;
  Item 0
    .FirstIndex:89
    .Length:24
    .Value:&quot;&lt;h1&gt;RegEx Example&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
    .SubMatches:
      .Count:1
      Item 0
        &quot;RegEx Example&quot;
  Item 1
    .FirstIndex:265
    .Length:20
    .Value:&quot;&lt;h1&gt;Level One&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
    .SubMatches:
      .Count:1
      Item 0
        &quot;Level One&quot;
  &lt;/nowiki&gt;
The name of the item is in the ''SubMatches'' of each item but where is the text?  To get that we can simply use ''Mid$'' together with the ''FirstIndex'' and ''Length'' properties of each match to find the start and finish of the text between the end of one ''h1'' and the start of the next.  However, as usual there is a problem.  The last match is not terminated by another ''h1'' element but by the end of ''body'' tag.  So our last match will include that tag and all the stuff that can follow the body.  The solution is to use another expression to get just the body first:

  &quot;&lt;body&gt;([\s\S]*)&lt;/body&gt;&quot;

This returns just one match with on sub-match and the sub match is everything between the body and end body tags.  Now we can use our original expression on this new string and it should work.

Now that you have seen an example here is a detailed description of the expressions used and the property settings of the Regular Expression object used.

A regular expression is simply a string of characters but some characters have special meanings.  In this expression:

  &quot;&lt;body&gt;([\s\S]*)&lt;/body&gt;&quot;

there are three principal parts:

  &quot;&lt;body&gt;&quot;
  &quot;([\s\S]*)&quot;
  &quot;&lt;/body&gt;&quot;

Each of these parts is also a regular expression.  The first and last are simple strings with no meaning beyond the identity of the characters, they will match any string that includes them as a substring.  

The middle expression is rather more obscure.  It matches absolutely any sequence of characters and also captures what it matches.  Capturing is indicated by surrounding the expression with round brackets.  The text that is captured is returned as one of the ''SubMatches'' of a match.

{|
|-
|&lt;body&gt;||matches just &lt;body&gt;
|-
|(||begins a capture expression
|-
|[||begins a character class
|-
|\s||specifies the character class that includes all white space characters
|-
|\S||specifies the character class that includes all non-white space characters
|-
|]||ends the character class
|-
|*||means that as many instances of the preceding expression as possible are to be matched
|-
|)||ends the capture expression
|-
|&lt;/body&gt;||matches &lt;/body&gt;
|}

In the case studies section of this book there is a simple application that you can use to test regular expressions: [[../Regular Expression Tester|Regular Expression Tester]].

Hello Kmarinas86, welcome to Wikibooks! I suggest that you go read [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] and learn what this project is about. Then you can [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|become a contributor]].

I noticed that your first contribution, [[Cyclic Multiverse Theory]], is now on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. It seems that it had [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cyclic Multiverse Theory|faced deletion on Wikipedia]], and some Wikipedia users had unfortunately suggested moving the page to Wikibooks. We have [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not a place to publish original works|rules against original research]], which is what your contribution seems to be.

There is almost certainly some wiki that can take original-research contributions. I wonder if [[wikinfo:Main Page|Wikinfo]] would take it. They are similar to Wikipedia, but have [[wikinfo:Wikinfo:About/Comparisons to Wikipedia|several significant differences]]. I do not contribute to Wikinfo (though I read it sometimes) so I am not immediately sure if it is an appropriate place. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:29, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Visual Basic has a traditional set of built in string operations.  Unlike many languages Visual Basic strings are always [[w:Unicode|Unicode]] so they can hold any character.  They are also always dynamically allocated and are of almost unlimited length (theoretically up to about 2^31 characters, about 2000 million). 

Note that Unicode uses more than one byte to represent each character.  As far as VB is concerned Unicode characters are two bytes which gives 2^16 or 65536 possible values.  This is enough even for Chinese, Japanase and Korean character sets (''CJK'').  In fact Unicode defines 17 planes each of which has room for 2^16 code points but VB (and Windows) uses only the [[w:Basic Multilingual Plane|Basic Multilingual Plane]] (''BMP'').

See [http://web.archive.org/web/20080626021549/http://www.romanpress.com/Articles/Strings_R/Strings.htm What Are VB Strings?] for a concise explanation of the internal workings of Visual Basic Classic strings.

==[[../Built In String Functions|Built In String Functions]]==
Visual Basic provides a reasonable set of traditional functions for manipulating and searching strings.  These functions are usually all that is needed for most programs that are not primarily concerned with text processing.  

==[[../Regular Expressions|Regular Expressions]]==
A regular expression is a character string in which some characters have special meanings.  Such a string can be used to search for substrings in another string in much more sophisticated ways than the built in InStr function.

For example this expression:

  &quot;(dog|cat)&quot;

will match either 'dog' or 'cat'.

Visual Basic has no built in regular expression functions, but these are available in the VBScript regular expression library.  If your program does a lot of text processing ''regular expressions'' are definitely worth learning even though they may seem intimidating at the start.  In practice most programmers find that the more arcane expressions are rarely used and the same idioms are recycled over and over so there is really not as much to learn as it at first appears.

Fireman's carry: Begin by tying up with inside control. Next you will need to do a draw-in step (take a step backwards to draw the opponent in to you). As they step in towards you, drop to your left knee while holding on to the inside control with your left hand(DO NOT LET GO). Take your right arm and wrap it around the opponents right leg. Drop your left shoulder to the mat and sit through to a headlock.

Lots of this stuff made it into the 1999 C standard or is available via the optimizer. The standard C way to do a rotation is to use shifting, masking, and oring. A good compiler, like gcc, will use a rotate instruction for this. Variable length array stuff is in the 1999 standard. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:54, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

: Yes. Should we spell out exactly how to do that here, or just link to other sections of this book for more details? [[C Programming/Further math#shift and rotate]] discusses the rotate instruction. [[Talk:C Programming/Weaknesses of C]] briefly mentions the &quot;variable length array&quot; syntax and the &quot;flexible array member&quot; syntax. Where in this book is the right place to fully explain how to use them? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 15:44, 3 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

----
Tight waist tilt-get a tight waist and drive your opponent at a 11 o'clock angle(if you have the tight waist in your right hand)while driving pull the waist and secure an arm with your other arm and get into a tight near fall position.not good for pinning but great for getting quick easy points 

'''Riding Legs'''

''The key to riding legs is constantly repositioning your hips!''
When you ride legs, or &quot;throw legs in&quot; you need to have excellent balance.
This will be explained starting from referees position, on the left side.

1- Take your left leg and kick it between your opponents left arm and left leg, then rap it around his left leg. 

2-Using your Right Leg, do what is called a &quot;Dig Shin.&quot; where you put your foot under your opponents shin and raise itup to keep your opponent off balance. It also acts like an emergency brake if you get thrown.

3- ALWAYS GRAB HOLD OF SOMETHING WHEN RIDING LEGS! GRAB HIS ARM OR LEG, THROW IN A HALF, ANYTHING!

Now there are a couple moves you can work from here...

*Guillotine
One of the best/hardest moves in wrestling. With your left leg in, use your left arm to hook his right arm. Then grab his right wrist with your right hand. Lift the arm just high enough to where you can duck your head under it, and pop it up on the other side of the arm. Release his arm with your left arm but stay on th wrist with your right. Arch back SLOWLY, while SLOWLY reaching your left arm towards his head. Once you have his head and he is on his back, let go of his wrist and connect both hands around his head. Pull his head toward you and arch into him with your hips, HARD. Stand by for the win.

*Banana Split
A less complicated move than the guillotine. With the left leg in, reach your left arm to the inside of his right leg. Connect your right hand behind the leg with your left. Then arch backwards and roll him onto his back. Arch into him as hard as possible. 

*Inverted Spladle
This move is dangerous in the higher weights, so let the little guys stick to this one (103-140)
With the left leg in, reach with your RIGHT arm inside of the right leg. Connect with your left hand in FRONT of the right leg. Roll to his back. If you lock this up correctly, and hang on tight, there is practically no way to lose, unless you are losing by 4 points and you run out of time for the pin.

*Power Half
This is a pretty basic move. all you have to do is get both of your legs in  then get in a half and hook it up with your other hand then begin powering them over. 
  
*Helicopter
This is a simple move where you throw the leg that is not hooked to the other side of the opponents body like your leg is the arm of a helicopter then when the opponent falls to his hip cross face him to the mat.(swing your leg as hard as possible)

[[Image:Artocarpus heterophyllus fruits at tree.jpg|thumb|Jackfruit]]

The '''jackfruit''' is a very large fruit from trees native to south-western [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] and [[Cookbook:Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]]. Jackfruit can be up to 90cm long, 50cm in diameter, and weight up to 36kg. The taste is similar to that of [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]], but milder and less juicy. It is popular throughout [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asia]] and [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-east Asia]].

Jackfruit can be eaten as a fresh fruit, both ripe and unripe. It is also often combined into cooked meals, both sweet and savoury. Jackfruit can be bought in cans, and as dried pieces. 

{{Wikipedia|Jackfruit}}
[[Category:Jackfruit recipes|*]]


===Young fruit===
The young fruit is called ''Polos'' in Sri Lanka. It is a dish with spices to replace meat curries in Sri Lankan cuisine. The skin of unripe (young) jack fruit must be pared first and discarded and then the whole fruit can be chopped into edible portions and cooked to be eaten. The raw young fruit is not edible. Young jackfruit has a mild flavour and distinctive poultry like texture. The cuisines of India,Nepal,Bangladesh,Sri Lanka,Indonesia,Cambodia, and Vietnam use cooked young jackfruit. In Indonesia, young jackfruit is eaten as gudeg. In many cultures, jackfruit is boiled and used in curries as a staple food.
[[Image:Jackfruit chips.jpg|thumb||upright|Jackfruit chips]]


===Ripe fruit===
Ripe jackfruit is naturally sweet with subtle flavouring. It can be used to make a variety of dishes including custards, cakes, halo-halo and more. Ripe jackruit arils are sometimes seeded, fried and sold as jackfruit chips.

== Move this book ==

Shouldnt this book be moved to [[Google_Services_And_Products/Gmail]] , its more organized --[[User:Ncusa367|Ncusa367]] ([[User talk:Ncusa367|talk]]) 18:11, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

: I have to respectfully disagree with your oppinion that the single page at [[Google_Services_And_Products/Gmail]] is more organised than [[Gmail]]. I suggest that we merge the content to this book and link here. We could place this book under [[Google_Services_And_Products]] but, frankly, I don't see the need for it.
: An argument could be made to place it under a book on free email services. Since there are multiple ways of categorising it, but it doesn't depend on any other modules, I think it's better to keep things seperate and link books on related topics. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:42, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

== Delete the old name convention redirects ==

The argument against is that there is no real need and one shouldn't delete pages that might have links pointing to them from outside Wikibooks. The argument for is that deleting these helps clear up the [[Special:AllPages]] indices and this wikibook is hardly such a big player that anyone will have links dating back a couple of years to the pages here. Anyone against? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:06, 12 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Cultivation Theory */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Noise=
There are '''three types of noise''', which garble a communication: 
'''''semantic''''' (i.e., speech impediments or misspelling), '''environmental''' (i.e., background noise), and '''''tech''''' (i.e., static). 

There are also '''three types of filters''', which determine how a communication gets interpreted by the receiver: 

''info'' (i.e., the message is in a language unknown to the receiver), ''physical'' (i.e., the reciever is fatigued), or ''psych'' (i.e., the receiver is prejudiced in some way toward the communicator or message).

= Hypodermic Model=

'''The hypodermic needle model is a model of communications'''. It is also referred to as the &quot;magic bullet&quot;, or the &quot;profound effects&quot; theory. Essentially this model holds that an intended message is directly received and wholly accepted by the receiver.

The most famous example of what would be considered the result of the Magic Bullet or Hypodermic Needle Model was the 1938 broadcast of The War of the Worlds and the subsequent reaction of the mass American audience that was tuned in.

The phrasing &quot;Hypodermic needle&quot; is meant to give a mental image of a message's direct infusion into an individual. This view tends to ignore things like interpretation and for this fatal flaw it is clearly less than perfect.

A more modern version is the Two-step flow of communication theory (or &quot;minimal effects&quot; theory). The two-step flow model was propouded by Paul Lazarsfeld and Elihu Katz. Unlike the hypodermic needle model which considers mass media effects to be direct, the two-step flow model stresses human agency. (One way of looking at it is that media doesn't tell us what to ''think'', it tells us what to ''think about''.)

According to Lazarsfeld and Katz, mass media information is channeled to the &quot;masses&quot; through opinion leadership. The people with most access to media, and having a more literate understanding of media content, explain and diffuse the content to others.

Two-step flow model laid the foundation for diffusion of innovations.

=Cultivation Theory=

Developed by Professor George Gerbner, the '''Cultivation Theory'''  focuses on the effects of long term repetition of messages. This view of media's influence on culture states that it occurs over time through a distortion of reality. Cultivation Theory does not rely on extensive consumption of media, but that the media ''cultivates'' cultural change over time throughout society. 

The effects of cultivation of the media are exacerbated by an '''homogenized''' media landscape, where media outlets, through financial or other pressures, become similar or uniform. If all people receive a similar media message, portraying uniform values, then audiences will more quickly perceive those representations to be accurate.

=Elitist and Populist Media=



Broadly speaking, there are two views of media's place in society. One is Elitist (media should educate), and the other is Populist (media should be whatever the people want).

Marshall McLuhan was a famous media and communication theorist. He coined the term &quot;global village&quot; while discussing his belief that the effect of the television would be to unite the world. He also believed that print media changes the way you think, and that the written word could make language &quot;official.&quot;

== 1. Identify at least 20 symbols used in electronics. ==

[[Image:AY_Radio_Electronics_Symbols.png]]

== 2. Identify the value of resistors by the color code ==

From Wikipedia

The value of a resistor is marked on the device itself by using bands of colors.

[[Image:Resistor_bands.png]]

band '''A''' is first significant figure of resistance value in ohms&lt;br&gt;
band '''B''' is the second significant figure&lt;br&gt;
band '''C''' is the decimal multiplier&lt;br&gt;
band '''D''' if present, indicates tolerance of value in percent (no color means 20%)

Resistors manufactured for military use may also include a fifth band which indicates component failure rate (reliability); refer to MIL-STD-199 for further details.

The Standard EIA Color Code Table per EIA-RS-279 is as follows:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
!Color!!1st band!!2nd band!!3rd band (Multiplier)!!4th band (Tolerance)!!Temp. Coefficient

A useful mnemonic for remembering the first ten color codes is &quot;'''B'''etter '''B'''e '''R'''ight '''O'''r '''Y'''our '''G'''reat '''B'''ig '''V'''enture '''G'''oes '''W'''est&quot;, where the first letter matches the first letter of the color code, by order of increasing magnitude.

Resistors are measured in ohms, so ''yellow violet red brown'' means 4,700 ohms, 1% tolerance.

== 3. Demonstrate proper soldering techniques ==
Soldering is a way of semi-permanently connecting electronic components together or to a circuit board.  It involves heating the solder to its melting point and letting it re-solidify on the components themselves.  The heating is done with a soldering iron.  

Begin by turning on the soldering iron and waiting until it is hot enough to melt solder.  You can test this by touching some solder to the tip of the iron.  Clean the tip of the soldering iron by wiping it on a wet sponge.  This may be repeated often when soldering a lot of joints.

The connection should also be bright and clean before attempting to solder them.  They are often clean enough and require no attention, but if you have difficulty getting the solder to stick, clean them with some solder flux.

Place the tip of the iron on the components you wish to connect and heat them both.  Do this while simultaneously touching the solder to the components - do not touch the solder to the iron.  The goal is to heat the components to the point where they are able to melt the solder themselves.  Otherwise you will end up with a &quot;cold&quot; solder joint which will fail sometime in the future.

If soldering wires, twist them together first.  Although solder has a small amount of mechanical strength, it is not sufficient to withstand very much stress.  Therefore, it should not be relied upon for anything other than making an electrical connection.  If the joint is stressed, it can easily fail.

And always remember - solder is HOT, as are freshly soldered electronic components. Failure to be careful may result in a nasty burn.

== 4. Explain the use and operation of various important components in electronics such as resistors, variable capacitors, fixed capacitors, coils, transistors, integrated circuits, diodes, and transformers. ==
=== Resistor ===
The function of a resistor is to limit the current in a circuit.  Resistors can also be combined into &quot;voltage divider&quot; circuits by placing them in series.

=== Fixed Capacitor ===
A fixed capacitor can be used to hold a charge.  They are often used to smooth noise out of power supply circuits by placing them in parallel with the power supply.  A capacitor cannot pass DC if it is placed in series.  This is because the impedance of a capacitor varies with the frequency, and at zero Hertz (DC), its impedance is infinite.  Large capacitors have less impendence at a given frequency than a small capacitor, and because of this, capacitors can be used in &quot;frequency selective circuits&quot; such as filters.

The value of a capacitor is measured in farads, or more commonly, in microfarads.  A microfarad is a millionth of a farad.  Large capacitors have tens or hundreds of microfarads.  Smaller capacitors are measured in picofarads (a picofarad is a millionth of a microfarad, or a trillionth of a farad).  The microfarad is often abbreviated as μF (sometimes uF) and picofarads are often abbreviated as pF.

=== Variable Capacitor ===
A variable capacitor can be used in a frequency selective circuit where the user has control over the selected frequency.  An example of this would be in a radio or television tuner.  

=== Coil ===
A coil is also known as an inductor.  The impedance through a coil is also frequency dependent, but in the opposite way as in a capacitor.  At DC, an inductor has nearly zero impedance, and the impedance increases with higher frequencies.  Inductors are often used in conjunction with capacitors in frequency selective applications.  They are also often used for filtering out noise from power supplies.  Since a power supply is supposed to provide a constant voltage (0 Hertz), an inductor can be placed in series between the supply and the load.  The inductor will absorb the higher frequencies so that the load does not see them.

Inductors are measured in henries, which is abbreviated as H.

=== Transistor ===
A transistor has two basic applications - it can be used as a switch and it can be used as an amplifier.  

There are two basic types of transistors, bipolar and field effect.

A bipolar transistor has three terminals: the base, the collector, and the emitter.  Current flowing from the base to the emitter controls the amount that can flow from the collector to the emitter.  If no current flows from the base to the emitter, no current can flow from the collector to the emitter.  This is how a bipolar transistor can be used as a switch.

There are two types of bipolar transistors: NPN and PNP.  In an NPN bipolar transistor, the current flowing from the collector to the emitter is proportional to the current flowing from the base to the emitter.  A small signal can be amplified by injecting it into the base of the transistor.  In this case, the current from the collector to the emitter is an amplified version of the current flowing from the base to the emitter.

A PNP bipolar transistor works the same way as an NPN except that the direction of current flow is reversed - that is, it flows from the emitter to the base, and from the emitter to the collector.  In the case of a PNP transistor, it helps to think about &quot;pulling&quot; current out of the base rather than &quot;injecting&quot; it into the base.

A field effect transistor is similar to a bipolar transistor.  There are two types of field effect transistors (FETs): N-channel, and P-channel.  They too have three terminals: the gate, the drain, and the source.  If a voltage is applied between the gate and the source of an N-channel FET , the resistance from the drain to the source is reduced.  If enough voltage is applied between the gate and the source, current can flow from the drain to the source unimpeded.  If no voltage is applied, no current can flow from the drain to the source.

In a P-channel FET, the voltages and currents are reversed - that is, when the gate is more negative than the source, current can flow from the source to the drain.

=== Integrated Circuit ===
An integrated circuit - or &quot;chip&quot; is a collection of transistors and resistors etched into a silicon (or other semiconducting material) chip.  Very complicated circuits can be built by combining many transistors onto a single chip.  The number of transistors that can be put on a single chip is well over a million.

=== Diode ===
A diode is a device that allows current to flow in one direction, but not in the other.   This can be used in constructing an AC to DC converter, or for protecting a circuit from outside voltage sources.

=== Transformer ===
A transformer consists of one or more coils located within close proximity to one another.  When current passes through a coil, it generates a magnetic field.  When the current varies, so does the magnetic field.  When a varying magnetic field is set up near a coil, a current is induced in that coil.  By placing two coils in a common magnetic field and injecting a varying current into one (the primary), a proportional current is induced in the other (the secondary).  The ratio depends on how many turns each coil has.  If a transformer boosts the voltage, it will reduce the current, and if it reduces the voltage, it will increase the current.  Thus, the power through the transformer is preserved (other than a loss).  Electric companies transmit power by passing the electricity through step up transformers so that less current (but very high voltage) can be transmitted over long distances.  Power loss in a transmission line equals the current squared times the resistance, so reducing the current by stepping up the voltage saves a ''lot'' of energy.  The voltage is stepped down again before it is delivered to a customer.

Transformers are also used to isolate two circuits so that only AC passes between them and their DC power supplies do not interfere with one another.

== 5. Know and understand Ohm's Law. ==
If a voltage is applied across a resistor, current will flow through it.  Ohm's law describes the relationship between this current, voltage, and resistance.  It can be written as 

&lt;math&gt; V = I R &lt;/math&gt;

Where v is voltage (measured in volts), i is current (measured in amps), and r is resistance (measured in ohms).  The equation can also be written as

&lt;math&gt; I = \frac{V}{R} &lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; R = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Basically, it means that if the voltage is held constant and the resistance is decreased, the current is increased.  Or if the resistance is held constant and the current is increased, the voltage will also increase.

== 6. Determine how to correctly place or pin integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, and capacitors in a circuit board. ==
=== Integrated Circuits ===
Integrated circuits usually have some means of indicating where &quot;pin 1&quot; is on the device.  Once pin 1 is located, the remaining pins are numbered going counter-clockwise around the device.  On a DIP, pin one is located to the left of a notch milled into the top of the IC as shown below:

[[Image:Pin_one_indicator.png|Pin one indicator on an 8-pin DIP ]]

=== Transistors ===
Transistors come in a variety of packages.  To determine which pin is the base, collector, and emitter (bipolar transistors) or gate, source, and drain (field effect transistors), refer to the device's data sheet.

=== Diodes ===
A diode is usually marked with a stripe near its cathode.  Current flows from the anode to the cathode, but not from the cathode to the anode.  The stripe can be interpreted to look like a gate that won't let the current enter.

=== Capacitors ===
Only polarized capacitors are &quot;pinned,&quot; and care must be taken to not plug them in backwards.  If an electrolytic capacitor is charged in reverse, it can explode.  Polarized capacitors are often marked with a stripe showing which terminal is the cathode (negative terminal).  Sometimes the stripe will connect the cathode and the anode, but it will have arrows or minus signs on the stripe indicating direction of current flow (anode to cathode).  In a schematic, the curved plate of the capacitor represents the cathode and the straight plate represents the anode.

[[Image:Polarized_capacitors.jpg|Polarized Capacitors]]



In the picture above, the cathode of the black capacitor is on the right.  The cathode of the blue capacitor is toward the bottom.

== 7. What is meant by a parallel and a series circuit? ==
A series circuit is a circuit in which the components are placed end-to-end.  A parallel circuit connects both terminals of two components together.

[[Image:Series_parallel_resistors.png|Series and Parallel Circuits]]

In a series circuit the current flowing through both devices will be equal, but the voltage across them will be different if the resistances are different.

In a parallel circuit, the voltage across the two elements will be identical, but the current divides between them.  Some current goes through the top, the rest goes through the bottom.

== 8. From a kit or from scratch make two of the following: ==
Good places to find components for the projects detailed below include [http://www.radioshack.com Radio Shack], [http://www.mouser.com Mouser], [http://www.digikey.com Digikey], and [http://www.jameco.com Jameco].  All of these suppliers will sell to hobbyists in small quantities.

Another option for building these is to buy a kit.  You can buy kits for individual projects or you can buy general purpose kits that will let you experiment with many different circuits.  Check with Radio Shack to see their current offerings.  Electronics kits can also be found at toy stores, especially those that emphasize &quot;learning&quot; toys.  Such suppliers include Toys R Us and Imaginarium, both of which offer kits over the Internet via Amazon.

=== Photocell Guard or Counter ===
The Photocell Guard circuit is a photo sensitive switch that will either turn on or turn off some device.  In modern terminology, it would be called a photo-sensitive switch.  A Photocell Counter is a circuit which counts the number of times a photo-sensitive switch is activated.  In modern terminology, it would be called a Photo-sensitive Counting Circuit.

[[Image:Photo_detector.png|Photo Detector]]

In this circuit, R2 is a cadmium sulfide cell (CdS cell) - that is, a light-sensitive resistor.  When exposed to light, the resistance of the cell decreases.  In darkness, the cell has a higher resistance.  R1 and R2 together form a voltage divider circuit.  As the light striking CdS cell gets brighter, the voltage at the common terminal decreases.  As it gets darker, the voltage increases.  This voltage is applied to the positive terminal of a comparator IC.  The negative terminal of the comparator is connected to the wiper of a potentiometer which forms a second voltage divider circuit.  This voltage can be adjusted by tuning the potentiometer.  When the light striking the CdS cell gets bright enough, it causes the voltage on the positive terminal to fall below the voltage on the negative terminal.  This causes the output of the comparator to go to zero volts, thus lighting the LED.  When it gets dark again, the LED will turn off.

The action of the LED can be reversed (on when dark, off when bright) by reversing the positions of R1 and R2 (the CdS cell), by swapping the positive and negative terminals of the comparator, or by connecting the LED through a resistor to ground instead of connecting it through a resistor to power.

=== Siren ===
[[Image:Siren_circuit.png|Siren Circuit]]
&lt;br&gt;
The circuit presented here looks intimidating at first glance, but as with most things, when it is broken down into smaller parts, it's a lot easier to understand.

The first thing to note is that this circuit requires a bipolar power supply - that is, a power supply that can provide both positive and negative voltages.  This is accomplished here with two batteries.  The circuit was tested with voltages ranging from ±4.5V to ±12V, so a pair of 9 volt batteries works pretty well.

Moving to the right we come to an op-amp configured as a low-frequency oscillator.  This oscillator, in conjunction with the transistor Q1 controls the frequency of a second oscillator (denoted as the &quot;Audio Frequency Oscillator&quot; in the schematic.

The frequency of the low-frequency oscillator is set by the capacitor C1, and the resistors R1, R2, and R3.  When the output of the amplifier (at pin 1) is high, C1 charges through R1.  When the voltage across C1 exceeds the threshold voltage on the positive terminal of the op-amp, the output will go low.  When this happens, C1 will then discharge though R1 and the voltage at the positive terminal will change to a negative value.  When C1's voltage drops below the threshold voltage at the positive terminal, the output switches high again, and the cycle repeats.  The threshold voltage at the positive terminal is set by the ratio of R1 and R2, as well as by the output of the amplifier:

&lt;math&gt;V_{thresh} = \frac{R1}{R1+R2} \times V_{out}&lt;/math&gt;

If the voltage at the output of the low-frequency oscillator is observed on an oscilloscope, it will be shown as a square wave, oscillating between the two battery supply voltages.  If this value were used to drive the base of Q1, the transistor would switch suddenly between full-on and full-off, and this would cause the audio oscillator's frequency to jump suddenly between two values (this makes it sound more like a cell phone ringing than a siren - try it!).  To get a siren-effect, we need a smooth frequency transition, so the base of the transistor is driven with the voltage on the capacitor C1 which is a triangle wave.

The next portion of the circuit to consider is the audio frequency oscillator.  This circuit is almost exactly the same as the low-frequency oscillator, except that the RC values have been changed so that it oscillates at a higher frequency, and the voltage divider circuit that sets the threshold voltage at the positive terminal (pin 5) is modified.  The lower half of this voltage divider includes a transistor.  As the transistor turns on, the resistance of the lower half of the voltage-divider is changed, and this will change the frequency of the audio oscillator.  Thus, the pitch of the audio will increase and decrease at a rate set by the low-frequency oscillator.

Finally, we come to the power amplifier.  This is a simple unity-follower op-amp, and its purpose is to drive the speaker and to isolate it from the audio oscillator.  If the speaker were connected directly to the output of the audio oscillator, it would change the characteristics of that section, and we would not hear the siren effect.

=== Simple voltmeter ===
This link has some material on using an LM3914 as a 
[http://www.electronics-tutorials.com/devices/lm3914.htm Bar Graph Meter].

Here's another link for building a
[http://braincambre500.freeservers.com/ddv.htm Digital Dashboard Meter].

There are several analog to digital converter (including the MAX136, MAX1496, and ICL7107) chips that will directly drive any of several 7-segment LED displays.  A web search of these part numbers (or search for &quot;3.5 digit LED&quot; for other devices) should turn up a data sheet, and most data sheets have &quot;typical application&quot; sections showing how these can be connected.

=== Pressure sensor ===
=== Simple DC power supply ===
[[Image:Simple dc power supply schematic.png|Schematic of a Simple DC Power Supply]]

In this DC power supply, household current (120VAC, 60Hz in North America) is applied to the power cord on the left.  The fuse protects the circuit and '''should not be omitted'''.  The voltage is then stepped down by the power transformer.  Power transformers are available at Radio Shack and at hardware stores (see the doorbell section).  Try to select a transformer that will output a voltage close to but a little higher than the desired DC output voltage.  

Once the voltage has been stepped down, it goes through a network of diodes set up as a &quot;full bridge rectifier.&quot;  The diodes direct current to the top of the network and allow it to return through the bottom, regardless of whether the input voltage is positive or negative.  

The capacitor then smooths out the voltage.  Without the capacitor, the output from the diode network would continually drop to zero, and then rise back up to its peak value.  The capacitor averages this out, giving a smoothed DC value.

The next element in the circuit is an LM7805, a 5-volt linear voltage regulator.  This can be replaced with similar devices to get different voltages (i.e., an LM7812 for 12V, an LM7809 for 9 volts, etc.).  The LM7805 will output a steady 5 Volts as long as the input voltage is sufficiently high.  The transformer should be chosen such that the voltage input to the regulator is not much higher than 5V (6V or 7V would be good).  Excess voltage is dropped across the device's input and output terminals, and is converted to heat.  The greater this voltage, the more heat the device has to dissipate.  Since it can only dissipate a finite amount of heat, this in effect limits the amount of power this circuit can provide.  Attaching a heat sink to the LM7805 will also help.

The circuit should be mounted in some sort of enclosure to protect the 120VAC input power terminals.  The power terminals themselves should be wrapped in electrical tape or in heat shrink tubing for additional protection.

=== Simple transistor radio ===
Although this
[http://www.somerset.net/arm/fm_only_one_transistor_radio.html FM Radio Project] uses only one transistor, it is ''still'' fairly complicated.  It might be better to buy a kit for this one.  Check with Radio Shack.

== 9. Draw from memory, using proper symbols, the complete wiring diagram of the devices constructed in requirement 8. ==

The easiest way to commit these diagrams to memory is by understanding them.  The photocell and power supplies are the easiest to understand, and if both are made, the power supply can be used to power the photocell circuit.  The siren and radio circuits are somewhat more complicated, but they are also more rewarding.

== 10. List ten ways electronics are used in everyday life. ==

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;It is now possible for any writer with a book to get it published at nominal cost or free, and to have it on sale at booksellers like Amazon.com.&quot;|caption=--Piers Anthony}}

All authors who publish books and articles have at least one thing in common: they believe their work is interesting, desirable, or useful to other people. Many texts, such as this Rhetoric and Composition wikitext, are published online and are available for free, without any paid authors or editors. Although many authors and readers prefer print publications, it is now entirely possible to earn a good living writing exclusively for the web. 

Getting published may seem unlikely or even impossible, but there are readily available resources to help you. If you are interested in freelance writing for magazines, the ''Writer’s Market'' is probably one of the most accessible and helpful sources (see below). If you are interested in publishing scholarly or professional research, you will need to familiarize yourself with the journals and book publishers associated with your field. 

It is very important to know a publisher's expectations before sending them a manuscript. Pay close attention to the publisher's policies; some do not accept any unsolicited manuscripts, and many have strict rules about formatting, subject matter, and deadlines. Don't waste time and money sending out manuscripts that are certain to be rejected.

If you want to send an idea for a potential article or book to an editor, you may do this in a query letter. A query letter should be short and to the point. The point is to interest the editor into buying your idea or article or at least requesting a book proposal or entire manuscript. Included in a query letter is a strong opening lead about the article, book, or piece, a description of the development or structure and content, any other information or images you intend to include, why you are qualified to write the piece, and a solid closing requesting to write or submit the piece. It would be wise to include a deadline for reply.

=Types of Publication=
The first thing you should do is figure out what type of publishing venue is appropriate for your needs.

==Do-It-Yourself Print Publishing==
Print publication is the oldest and most traditional way to earn a living as a writer and flourish as an academic. Unfortunately, printing books is an expensive process, and you may find it difficult to interest a publisher in your work. Anyone, however, can pay out of pocket to have a book published by a vanity press. The results are often quite good, with a slick and glossy production that is indistinguishable from other books. If you have a manuscript with very limited commercial appeal (such as a history of your family or hometown), or want to control the marketing of the book yourself, a vanity press may be the way to go. Costs vary depending on the size and types of illustrations used in the book.

==Academic Publishing==
Academic publishing is how scholars share their research and critically review other works. This type of publishing includes academic journals and books in the sciences and humanities. You are probably most familiar with academic journals in electronic form, since many college libraries offer access to extensive databases of journal articles in electronic form, such as JSTOR and Elsevier's Science Direct. Categories for journals range from physics and geometry to education and art, but all are written for other scholars in a particular field. Authors are rarely paid for publishing articles in academic journals--the reward comes instead in the form of increased prestige or a promotion.

==Commercial Publishing==
Commercial publishing means writing for profit and is the way the majority of professional authors earn their living. Commercial publication can include books, articles, journals, magazines, and more. If you want to become a professional author, you should research the publishers who publish in your fields of interest. Familiarize yourself with their titles and consider how your work will complement their existing selections. Visit their websites or call them to learn how they solicit manuscripts. Some will only accept manuscripts delivered to them by agents. In any case, you will need to convince the publisher that your work has commercial value and an adequate audience of potential readers. 

''Writer’s Market'' is a well-known resource for freelance writers. It offers market information, tips for getting published, advice from agents and editors, and formatting information. These services are available in the ''Writer's Market'' book and at [http://www.writersmarket.com/ WritersMarket.com]. There is an annual or monthly fee for online access.

==Electronic Publication==
Publishing your work online can take many forms, such as blogs, wikis, Adobe PDF files, e-books, and so on. There are plenty of easy ways to make your works available online for free, but earning a profit on them is a different matter. The Amazon Kindle and Apple iPad have opened up new opportunities for writers and publishers interested in selling electronic works. Also, many formerly print-based newspapers and magazines now offer websites, many with original articles published exclusively online. Search the websites for information about submitting a manuscript or query. While the pay is unlikely to match that of print publications, there are still plenty of opportunities to support yourself as a freelance author.

'''Freelance Writing'''

Writing, unfortunately, cannot always be done simply for the love of writing. Unless one has a wealthy spouse or a bursting portfolio, spending a significant amount of time writing requires that you treat it like a business. The freelance writer must be part writer, and part business-person. In fact, when considering everything involved in maintaining a living as a freelance writer, the career is similar to that of a small-buisness owner. It involves secure jobs, setting prices, and negotiating skills. 

This lifestyle may conjure up images of endless travel and world experience, but the fact is, you never get a paid vacation. Writing for publication results in jobs being canceled, payment delays, and payment shortcomings. One must be very careful in factoring the amount of money he/she will receive each month, as it can sometimes take months to get paid.

=Your Rights=
As a writer seeking publication, you should know your rights. Anything you write is automatically protected by copyright--no one else is permitted to publish it without your permission. When you find a publisher, you will likely sign a contract that transfers some or all of your copyright to the publisher. Contracts can be confusing and difficult for authors to understand; it is often worth finding an agent who can negotiate contracts with publishers to better suit your interest. Many terms of a contract can be negotiated, such as how long the publisher retains exclusive rights to publish your work, what media they can use to publish it, or even who controls the movie or television rights. 

There are also alternatives to standard copyright, such as [http://creativecommons.org/ Creative Commons] licensing. Creative Commons licenses vary in scope and coverage, but the basic idea is that anyone is allowed to copy and distribute your work without getting your permission first.

=External Links=
There are plenty of websites dedicated to supporting aspiring writers of all types. See the links below for more information.
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing/ Academic publishing]. Wikipedia's entry on academic publishing has lots of information and links for scholars and researchers.

|3=}}

&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;==How to use==
The {{tl|Guide to Unix/Clink}} template, used at [[Guide to Unix/Commands]], generates tables of links to pages about Unix commands. The basic syntax is:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Guide to Unix/Clink|''command''|''section''| ''special parameters''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

All of the parameters are optional except ''command'' and the special parameter ''s'' for the synopsis. Specifying a ''section'' number is highly recommended even if special parameters are not set. '''The command and section parameters must not contain spaces.'''

You can easily generate links:
* For *BSD manual pages, set '''bsds''' to ''yes'' and provide a section number.
* For Linux questions wiki page, set '''lqwiki''' to ''yes''.
* For GNU coreutils info page, set '''coreutils''' to a certain integer from the URL.

|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Clink|chmod|1| bsds=yes | s=changes file mode}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|{{Guide to Unix/Clink|chmod| lq=yes| s=changes file mode}}
|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Clink|chmod| lq=yes | s=changes file mode}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

|-
|{{Guide to Unix/Clink|chmod|1| bsds=yes| lq=yes| coreutils=81| s=changes file mode}}

|}

==How it works==
The template contains a table made with HTML and CSS. The CSS includes the usual code for templates that float to the right (&quot;float: right; clear: right;&quot;). The border style must be repeated for each cell because I would need style tags or an external stylesheet to create a CSS class.

This template uses the [[Template:Guide to Unix/Conditional|&quot;conditional&quot;]] hack to hide any table rows that are not in use. Entire rows are hidden on the server side because CSS &quot;empty-cells: hide;&quot; fails to hide rows in Konqueror, though it works in Firefox.

==How it works==
Including this template somewhere on a module or section places that module in [[:Category:Guide to Unix/Stubs]]. It is then easy to use that category page to find all stubs in the book [[Guide to Unix]].

For [[Guide to Unix]], it is better to use this than {{tl|stub}} or {{tl|sectstub}}.

==How to use==
This paragraph can appear on multiple [[Guide to Unix]] pages, usually above the various tables of contents. It suggests how to contribute. The paragraph provides a link for editing itself. This updates the paragraph on all pages that use it.

==How it works==
The HTML &quot;div&quot; element (between &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags) is a simple block-level element to which one can apply CSS style. In contrast, HTML &quot;span&quot; is an inline-level element. A &quot;div&quot; appears above or below other paragraphs while a &quot;span&quot; is embedded in paragraphs.

The template contains two &quot;div&quot; elements. The inner div contains the &quot;Edit this paragraph&quot; link and floats to the right. The floating actually causes the inner div to appear inside the outer div (the green box) but with the text of the outer div wrapping around it. See [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats the CSS spec on floats].

The outer div causes that paragraph to have a green background. The color #ccffcc has cc red light, ff green light, and cc blue light, which makes it almost white (#ffffff). It appears light green because it has less red and blue light than white does. Light values range from 00, 01, 02, ... fd, fe, ff.

Instructions: Write out the letters that the word is made up of. Write out the letters in lonely form.
&lt;!--Example:           #&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـت=؟&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      ---&gt;
&lt;!--Note: write to the left of the equal sign to add the Arabic word. The words you add do not have to be real words, they must connect as an Arabic word does though. Remember to add the connecting spacer by pressing SHIFT  then J. Do this so that the dots of one letter do not interfere with the letters of another--&gt;
#&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;  هكمي=؟&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: pronounciation → pronunciation using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">COPY THE SOURCE OF THIS PAGE TO THE PAGE THAT YOU WILL BE USING THIS TEMPLATE ON. ANYTHING IN COMPLETE CAPITAL LETTERS IS NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE NEW PART. IT IS INFORMATION FOR THE EDITOR/MAKER OF THE EXCERCISE/YOU.

Examples:
#&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـتـت &lt;/font&gt;      b-t-t&lt;br&gt;
#&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـثـبـتـف&lt;/font&gt;     b-th-b-t-f&lt;br&gt;

A group of letters is shown connecting as they would in a word. Your job is to read the word from right-to-left (that is the way Arabic is written and read), and write the English transliteration letters (from left-to-right). Separate transliterated letters with dashes.

Note: Because you have not learnt about writing vowels in Arabic, the transliteration only includes constanants. For example &quot;b-t-t&quot;, this means that the word contains the constanants in the word in that order, the vowels  are not indicated yet. Because the vowels aren't indicated the pseudo-word might be pronounced ba-ta-ta, bi-ti-ti, bit-ti, bat-tu, bu-tat, bat-ta and so on.


We learnt previously that the letter&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;(baa) makes the &quot;b&quot; sound, it's name is &quot;baa&quot;. 
So&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; بتت &lt;/font&gt;b-t-t  can be spelt out (baa, taa, taa) but the pronunciation of the word is not the same as how it is spelt. Once you learn about writing vowels you will be able to read words with vowels.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Examples:
#&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـتـت &lt;/font&gt; /b-t-t/&lt;br&gt;
#&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـثـبـتـف&lt;/font&gt; /b-θ-b-t-f/&lt;br&gt;

Remember, [θ] is the voiceless &quot;th&quot; sound as in &quot;thing&quot;.

A group of letters is shown connecting as they would in a word. Your job is to read the word from right to left (that is the way Arabic is written and read), and write the English transliteration letters (from left to right). Separate transliterated letters with dashes.

Note: Because you have not learned about writing vowels in Arabic, the transliteration only includes consonants. For example, &quot;b-t-t&quot;: this means that the word contains the consonants in the word in that order, while the vowels are not indicated yet. Because the vowels aren't indicated the pseudo-word might be pronounced /ba-ta-ta/, /bi-ti-ti/, /bit-ti/, /bat-tu/, /bu-tat/, /bat-ta/ and so on.

We learnt previously that the letter&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;(baa) makes the &quot;b&quot; sound, its name is &quot;baa&quot;. 
So&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; بتت &lt;/font&gt;b-t-t can be spelt out (baa, taa, taa) but the pronunciation of the word is not the same as how it is spelt. Once you learn about writing vowels, you will be able to read words with vowels.

== Removed incorrect and bias statement ==
I removed the line &quot;However the Python binding is an afterthought so most often late versus the C++ engine when usable at all. Python bindings are very inefficient and limited.&quot;, because in Ogre's case, the bindings are actually dynamically generated, and as such, only require a minimal amount of maintenance to keep up to date. In fact, the python bindings are sometimes ahead of the official release version, and because they're dynamically generated, support nearly every one of Ogre's excellent third party modules. 

In addition, because the engine itself is C++ and python simply controls it, in my own performance tests between Ogre's C++ demos and python demos, there is about a 6-10% performance hit when using python, which seems more than reasonable given the dramatic development time differences between python and C++. Couple that with the fact that, once your game/product is nearing completion, you can go back and rewrite heavy number-crunching methods (pythons main weak spot, performance-wise) in C++, as well as JIT compliers like Psyco (psyco.sourceforge.net), and you have an incredibly efficient way to develop a game or other 3d application.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word &quot;utopia,&quot; in its most common meaning, refers to a socially or politically perfect state or nation. Alternatively, it can also be understood to mean the human efforts to create a better society, or more specifically, a perfect society that does not yet exist.

Ideas which could radically change societies or governments are may be referred to as &quot;utopian ideas,&quot; often in a negative tone. Similarly, &quot;utopia&quot; can be used in a negative way; often to discredit ideas deemed too optimistic, unrealistic, or hopeful to be practically realized in the world as it exists today.

&quot;Utopia&quot; has also been used to describe actual communities founded in an attempt to create a perfect or utopian society.

Conversely, the word &quot;dystopia,&quot; presumably a derivative of the word &quot;utopia,&quot; can be used to refer to a failed Utopia; that is, to a nightmarish civilization with laws or a social order contrary to the utopian ideal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">People do have to eat and live and find shelter. People must have their basic physiological needs met before they can go on to strive for the gratification of their higher needs. These higher needs include love, fulfilling social relationships, self-actualization, and so forth. 

Economics deals with allocating limited resources in the most advantageous ways possible. 

When you're creating a society it is important to see that the nations of today with the most successful economies are the ones that practice a free-market capitalism. Critics of capitalism point to the potential instability of a capitalist system or to the tendency of free markets to result in some members of society living in poverty or without prospects for self improvement. A separate concern that does not touch on political economics directly is the tendency of free market economies to cater to human appetites to the point of encouraging vices. While certain vices may stimulate a community's financial opportunities, they can also prove destructive to public morality in a way that conflicts with the desire for utopia.  

However if we attempt to establish this economy through a veil of ignorance which rawl's present's all people within this community would have agreed previously on the laws of the economy. When deciding which laws to enact the community should definitely vote through census. By doing hosting a census vote, and only through that can we make everybody within this community truly accept their economy.

      <comment>/* Utopia in Philosophy */ typo fix</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">It is important to learn from our mistakes. Extensive research should be done on previous attempts to build an utopia. 

===History of the Term===
{{sectstub}}

The word 'utopia' was coined by Thomas More in 1515 as the name of his fictional island. The name itself is a play on the Greek ou-topos, meaning &quot;no place&quot;, and eu-topos, meaning &quot;good place&quot; --an ironic joke on the likelihood of such a paradise existing. Since then 'utopian' and 'dystopian' have become literary genres of their own. Plato’s ‘Republic’ is now often referred to as a utopia as is Swifts ‘Gulliver’s Travels’ and even the biblical story of the Garden of Eden.  Famous modern attempts to understand a utopia include George Orwell’s classic 1984, Robert Heinlein's ‘Stranger in a Strange Land’ and Aldous Huxley’s ‘Brave New World.’

The term utopia has become a by-word for idealism, often used now as an ironic criticism of an overly enthusiastic plan.  Many authors have described their utopia with great practicality and attention to detail but still the term utopia has become stereotyped as reflecting ambitious notions that are too optimistic and idealistic for practical application; readers often argue their concepts are impossible, their logic refutable and thus their conclusions void.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The aim of this book is to collect examples of Utopian ideologies both past and present; to examine attempts—both successful and otherwise--to implement them; and to analyze the factors at play in utopian thinking. Additionally, critiques of utopian thoughts and ideals and the way in which they relate to utopian thinking will be examined in similar depth. 

A further aim of this writing is to assist those who wish to create the &quot;perfect&quot; society. Since the beginning of time, humans have attempted, with varying levels of success, to improve their respective societies in order to make them more harmonious systems; the problem for those thinkers developing theories of the perfect society is that it is oftentimes much easier to &quot;improve&quot; an existing society than it is to build a better one from nothing—though more than a few have tried to build &quot;from scratch&quot; in ways ranging from peaceful change to violent revolution.

The reader may wish to consider the following questions while reading or contributing to this book: If you had the opportunity to build the perfect society—considering the available resources in the land in question, the level of scientific knowledge, the developmental level of computer science, and so forth—what would it be? What economic system would you choose? What political system would be implemented? What laws passed, what rights recognized, what constitution written? And are attempts to create a perfect society  ultimately doomed to failure?

      <text xml:space="preserve">New Harmony, formerly named &quot;Harmony,&quot; was built by the Harmony Society, headed by George Rapp (also known as Johann Georg Rapp). This was the second of three towns built by the German religious group, known as Rappites. When the society decided to move back to Pennsylvania, they sold the 30,000 acres (121 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land and buildings to Robert Owen, the Welsh utopian thinker and social reformer for $150,000, who then changed the name from &quot;Harmony&quot; to &quot;New Harmony.&quot; Owen recruited residents to his model community, but a number of factors led to an early breakup of the communitarian experiment.

The experiment was established in 1825 and dissolved in 1829 due to constant quarrels. The town banned money and other commodities. American individualist anarchist, Josiah Warren, who was one of the original participants in the New Harmony Society, asserted that community was doomed to failure due to a lack of individual sovereignty and private property. He says of the community: &quot;It seemed that the difference of opinion, tastes and purposes increased just in proportion to the demand for conformity. Two years were worn out in this way; at the end of which, I believe that not more than three persons had the least hope of success. Most of the experimenters left in despair of all reforms, and conservativism felt itself confirmed. We had tried every conceivable form of organization and government. We had a world in miniature. --we had enacted the French revolution over again with despairing hearts instead of corpses as a result. ...It appeared that it was nature's own inherent law of diversity that had conquered us ...our &quot;united interests&quot; were directly at war with the individualities of persons and circumstances and the instinct of self-preservation... and it was evident that just in proportion to the contact of persons or interests, so are concessions and compromises indispensable.&quot; (Periodical Letter II 1856)

Underneath the pretty desktop background, candy-like graphics, and slick effects on the surface of Mac OS X is a [[UNIX]] foundation. UNIX handles all of the under-the-hood tasks of managing accounts, files, networking, performance, etc. While Apple's interface is very pretty and easy-to-learn, power users may wish to try out interacting with their Mac through UNIX's more traditional interface: the command line.

Please note that this chapter covers only the very basics of using the command line, and assumes you have no experience with command lines, programming, etc. If you want a more advanced look at UNIX, please view the [[../Advanced Concepts/]] chapter.

As with all versions of Unix, OSX consists of a kernel (as described in [[../History|history]]) and some core utils that are available through the bash shell. The kernel and the core utils are open-source, but not the additional pieces of osx such as finder and the various components that make OSX what it is. The UNIX theory consists in providing only basic functionalities (for example, the cp program can only copy files from one location to another) and so this model is fast, bug free, and secure because it's easily maintainable (taken from a Linux kernel programming book); everything is split into small parts for this reason.

==Getting to the Command Line==
To access the command line, you'll use the Terminal Utility. It's in the Applications &gt; Utilities folder.

==bash: The UNIX Finder==
*ls
*cp
*rm
*rmdir
*tar
*mkdir
*more
*ps
*ssh
*scp
*man

==compiler version==
http://www.voxgratia.org/docs/compilers.html

==Unix environment and programs==
As in all Unix systems, you can install and run UNIX software (for example X11, .KDe, etc.) on Mac OS X. There is even the Gentoo (Linux distribution) package system that runs under OSX (portage)

The Fink project ( http://fink.sourceforge.net ) maintains a collection of packages that have been ported to OSX and makes them available for download as a coherent distribution. Fink uses Debian tools like dpkg and apt-get to provide powerful binary package management. You can choose whether you want to download precompiled binary packages or build everything from source.

The only caveat is that the fink tools install their own libraries, and development tools, which if not handled carefully, can interfere with normal operation of your osx system.

==Limitations==
the file-system is not case sensitive by default, but this is configurable at install time.  Also, unlike other unix variants such as linux, command-line parameters can come only before the main arguments, instead of before or after.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why Learn Design Intent?==
Pro/Engineer [also: Solidworks &amp; Autodesk:Inventor] is a parametric modeler.  That means that features can be related to one another in a number of different ways.  These relationships govern how the model will behave when changed.  Design intent is the careful control of these relationships so that they correctly govern the intended behavior of the model.  With good design intent, models can be updated almost effortlessly.  Changes made to one aspect of a model propagate appropriately through the model, assembly, and drawing.  With poor design intent, features may update inappropriately, or fail.

Design intent builds intelligence into the model.

==Ways to control design intent==

===Part model references===
The first way to control design intent in a Pro/Engineer model is simply to select references appropriately when modeling a part.  Except for the default datum plane, every feature must reference something else.  You create a reference when you choose a sketching plane or any sketcher reference.

====Reference stable features for stability====
*Use '''datum planes''' as a baseline.  Solid features may change.  For instance, a hole referencing an edge may fail when a '''round''' or '''chamfer''' is created on that edge.  A hole referencing a '''face''' may fail when a draft is created on that face.
*When using solid features as references, choose more stable features.  That is, reference faces before edges and edges, when necessary, before vertices.  
*Create a '''base feature''' with the basic shape of a part.  Use its features 
*Use the model tree and Insert Here functionality to control feature order.  
*Features can only reference other features that occur earlier in the model tree.  Features cannot reference subsequent features.

====Model for design intent====
*When choosing references, ask how the model might change.  Should a hole stay centered on the part?  Should it remain a fixed distance from some face or edge?  Should it move with an associated feature, such as a boss?
*Consider the full range of possible changes.  Will a drastic change in a dimension make a sketch impossible to resolve, for instance by turning it inside-out?

==New FSF Address==
It seems that the Free Software Foundation changed their address from 59 Temple Place (address given in this license) to 51 Franklin St (address given at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html and other GNU web pages). So, I think someone should update the copyright to read as this. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 15:03, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

==Make includeable==

Please add &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags around all parts of this page which are metadata (e.g. tag at the top). This will allow the page to be included in wikibooks more easily. --[[User:Alfakim|Alfakim]] 14:03, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

==Interpreting the GFDL==
If one had questions regarding the interpretation of sections of the GFDL, where would one go for &quot;official&quot; answers? -- [[User:Jason.C.Daniels|Jason C Daniels]] 21:37, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

:The GNU project maintains the GFDL, so if you needed some &quot;official help&quot; about it, you could [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html ask the GNU people] about it on their website. In general, people around here have grown pretty knowledgable about it over time, so we can typically give you a good explanation if you need one. Also, because of the high-volume of images, the admins at [[Commons:Main page|Wikimedia commons]] have become experts on the subject in their own right, so you can consider asking questions there too. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:56, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

== Heading levels ==

The heading levels make in difficult to include this in printable versions, I think. Can we change it so that the sections are === rather than ==? That way each section of the GFDL won't be at the same level as a book chapter (the entire GFDL should be at the same level as a chapter, and GFDL sections should be the heading equivalent of a section within a chapter). &amp;mdash;[[User:Chowbok|Chowbok]] 04:29, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

:Use Level 1 headings in your printable versions, such as:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
= GNU Free Documentation License =
{{:GFDL}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

:Lots of other books already do this, so we shouldnt change the headings. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 04:31, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

::Well, I did do that... but that puts &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; tags in the body of the document, which strikes me as poor form. &amp;mdash;[[User:Chowbok|Chowbok]] 04:40, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

::Maybe we could have another protected GFDL page for print inclusions? Or can I just subst' it? &amp;mdash;[[User:Chowbok|Chowbok]] 04:42, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

:::Funny, yesterday I copied this Page for de.wikibooks and thought about the same thing.
:::My work a round is &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1|==}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which allow use to use h2-headings or simple bold with &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:::When I think about it, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1|&lt;h2&gt;}}} {{{2|&lt;/h2&gt;}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is the most flexible solution.
:::-- [[User:MichaelFrey|MichaelFrey]] 05:49, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

As Whiteknight has written above, second level heading in this text are correct. Chapter titles in print versions should be level one. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:17, 17 May 2007 (UTC)
:I disagree. Anyway, Whiteknight seems amenable to MichaelFrey's solution, and I like it too. Hopefully we can have that implemented soon. &amp;mdash;[[User:Chowbok|Chowbok]] 00:13, 18 May 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Omaha''' is a variant of [[../Hold'em|Texas Hold'em]] Poker. Omaha is considered, by some, to be the hardest game of Poker to master. Of all of the different games of Poker, Omaha is for many the hardest to learn to play and the hardest to bluff in. It is played most often at fixed limits, like Texas Hold'em and pot limit.

The play of Omaha is very similar to the play of Texas Hold'em and other Poker games, but different because you cannot use all of your cards.

==How to Play==
The dealer will deal each player four cards, starting to his left. Once all players receive their cards a round of betting occurs. Omaha is rarely played no-limit, meaning you can at any time bet any amount. It is generally a limit or pot-limit game. The betting starts to the left of the Big Blind. The Big Blind and the small blind are just left of the dealer. The small blind, who is one left of the dealer, has to put half of his &quot;blind&quot; or payment for seeing your cards into the pot before he can see his cards. It is a forced bet. The Big Blind, who is two left of the dealer, pays the entire &quot;blind&quot; before he can see his cards. This, too, is a forced bet. Once cards are dealt the player left of the Big Blind can call the blind, bet, or fold. Betting rotates around the table until it reaches the Big Blind who can call any subsequent bets, make a bet himself, or check, meaning that if nobody has bet, play will go to the flop for free.

===The Flop===
Once the first round of betting is over, here comes the flop. The top card of the deck is &quot;burnt&quot; or discarded, never to be seen or played. Then the dealer takes three cards for everyone to see. These are &quot;community&quot; cards. Community cards can be used by all players to create a five card hand along with your &quot;hole cards&quot; or the cards dealt to you by the dealer at the start of the hand. The catch for Omaha, however, is that unlike Hold 'Em, you cannot use all of your cards or just one of your cards in your hand. You must use exactly two cards from your hand and three from the board. In Hold'Em you can use one from your hand and four from the board or if your hand is particularly unworthy, all cards on the board! So, once the flop is dealt, another round of betting occurs, this time starting directly left of the dealer. The players can once again &quot;check, bet, or fold or raise&quot; to another's bet. Once this round of betting is complete, comes the turn card. 

===The turn===
Prior to the turn card another card is &quot;burnt&quot; or discarded. Then the turn card is put next to the flop. This is another community card that all players can use in making their five-card hands. Do not make the mistake of thinking you can use four of the cards on the board and one in your hand, or any other number than three on the board and two in your hand. Again, when the turn is dealt, a round of betting occurs starting left of the dealer. Once this round of betting is complete, comes the &quot;River&quot; card.

===The River===
Once the round of betting for the turn is complete one card from the top of the deck is &quot;burnt&quot; and the river card is shown on the board. This is another community card, and once again a round of betting occurs. After this round of betting is complete hands are shown and the player with the best five-card hand wins. Hand rankings are the same as hand rankings in Texas Hold'Em and other Poker games.

== Basic Strategy ==
Omaha is a dynamic game in which the strength of ones hand (and that of your opponents) may dramatically change during the hand.  It is important to realise what the nuts is and make sure you have it or close to it before investing large numbers of chips.  For example in a 5 way pot on a board with 3 to a flush, it would almost always be a mistake to call a bet relying a straight or 3 of a kind to hold up.  Similarly on a paired board it would be a mistake to invest too many chips with merely a flush or straight.  

For this reason it is important not to slow play your hands in Omaha, as you will be drawn out on with a much higher frequency than in Hold'em.  It is better to play aggressively and quickly with your best straights and flushes because if the board pairs they can become practically worthless.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==PL/I==
Here is the [[:w:PL/I|Wikipedia entry]].
===Type===
PL/I is a full procedural language.
===Execution Entry Point===
The program has its entry point specified as &lt;code&gt;OPTIONS(MAIN)&lt;/code&gt;, in a procedure statement, as in:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
 tree: procedure options (main);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Column specialties===
There are no column specialities.

===General Syntax===
An assignment example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
a = b*(c-d);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In this numeric assignment statement, &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is subtracted from &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, and the result multiplied by the value of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, before storing in variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
s = t || u;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In this example string assignment, string &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; is joined to the end of string &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, and the composite string is stored in string variable &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;.

Note: Using a compile-time option the concatenation operator &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; may be replaced by another pair of symbols, for being compatible with existing PL/I programs often &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt; is used.

===Comments===
Every comment commences with the pair &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; and terminates with the pair &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt;. Comments may span lines.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
/*
 * this is a long comment.
 */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Variable Declarations===
Declarations are not compulsory, though most PL/I compilers provide a compiler option to force declarations, while some of the subset compilers insist that every variable be declared.

To declare &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; as an binary:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare i fixed binary;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To declare &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; as an binary and give it an initial value of 0
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare i fixed binary initial (0);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To declare a variable as decimal,
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare D fixed decimal;
declare E fixed decimal (10,4);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The first declaration is of an integer &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; stored in decimal format, while the second is of a variable E capable of storing ten digits having 4 digits after the decimal point. To initialize &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;, write:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare E fixed decimal (10,4) initial (123456.7891);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Note that values such as 0.1 are stored exactly.

To define a floating-point variable:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare f float;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
that uses single precision hardware; and double precision:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare float decimal (15);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
and extended precision:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare float decimal (18);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
(typical declarations for the PC). The numbers 15 and 18 indicate the number of decimal digits that will be stored. (Although the values are actually held in binary, the decimal precisions are more convenient to recall than specifying the precisions in binary.) To specify a complex variable, simply include the word &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt; in the declaration, thus:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
DECLARE C FLOAT DECIMAL (15) COMPLEX;
C = 5.2+8i;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The assignment includes the complex constant 5.2+8i where 5.2 is the real part and 8 is the imaginary part.

The arithmetic data attributes for base (binary or decimal), scale (fixed or float) and mode (real or complex) may appear in any order, the attribute for precision (e.g. &lt;code&gt;(15)&lt;/code&gt;) must not be the first one.

The following definitions are equivalent, except for the last one.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare   number       fixed binary (15) real;
declare   number       binary fixed (15) real;
declare   number       binary fixed real (15);
declare   number       binary fixed (15);      /* because real is the default value of mode */
declare   number (15)  binary fixed real;      /* defines 15 numbers with default precision */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To declare a variable having the picture attribute:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare p picture ('9999v.999');
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
describes variable &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; as having as total of 7 decimal digits, with three digits after the decimal point. The decimal point is held in storage. The letter &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; indicates the position of the actual decimal point. For Europe, the specification may include a comma:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare p picture ('9999v,999');
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
To declare variable &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; as a character string:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare S character(10);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
String &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; can store exactly 10 characters.

To declare variable &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; as a character string capable of storing up to 100 characters:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare V character (100) varying;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
A simple assignment:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
V= 'abc';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
V holds the three characters &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
V = 'friendly';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
V holds the 8 characters &lt;code&gt;friendly&lt;/code&gt;.

PL/I also permits bit strings:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare b bit(10);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
permits bit strings to be stored, of length ten. The assignment statement:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
b = '1011110010'b;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
stores the bits in the given order. Such bit strings can be searched, etc., just like character strings.

Data structures, or aggregates, may be declared:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare 1 name,
          2 first_name   character (10),
          2 surname      character (15);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Arrays are declared by one of the above means, along with dimension information:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare x(10) float;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
specifies an array of ten elements, &lt;code&gt;x(1)&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;x(10)&lt;/code&gt;. The default lower bound is unity. To specify a different lower bound:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare y(0:15) float;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
declares a 16-element array &lt;code&gt;Y(0) through Y(15)&lt;/code&gt; of floating-point elements.

Multi-dimension array are declared by separating the dimensions with commas
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare   M ( 2 , 4:5 )   fixed binary (15)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
defines a 2-dimensional array of 4 elements: &lt;code&gt;M (1, 4)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;M (1, 5)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;M (2, 4)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;M (2, 5)&lt;/code&gt;

To handle dates given as 2-digit years and as 4-digit years, possibly intermixed in the same program, the &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; attribute may be used.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare d date ('YY'); [more to come]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The keywords &lt;code&gt;DECLARE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INITIAL&lt;/code&gt; may abbreviated as &lt;code&gt;DCL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INIT&lt;/code&gt;, many attributes may abbreviated, too.

===Output Statements===
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
put list ('Hello world!');
put skip list ('Hello world!');
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first example writes &lt;code&gt;Hello world!&lt;/code&gt; on the standard output (a screen or printer or file). The words are printed after any output already on that line. The second example starts a new line (the word &lt;code&gt;SKIP&lt;/code&gt;) before printing.

===Method Declaration/Implementation===
Describe how methods/functions/procedures are declared and implemented. The following example is of a complete PL/I program containing a function.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
/* A program to calculate the area of a triangle, */
/* given two sides and an included angle. */
d: procedure options (main);
        declare (b, c, angle) float;
        put list ('Today is ', date());
        put skip list ('Please type the lengths of two sides, and an angle');
        get list (b, c, angle);
        put skip list ('The two sides are', b, c, 'and the angle is', angle, 'degrees');
        put list ('Area of triangle=', area(b, c, angle));

area: procedure (b, c, angle) returns (float);
        declare (b, c, angle) float;
        return (b*c*sin(angle)/2);
end area;
end d;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The above program contains some typical input and output statements of the list-directed form.
The first &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; statement prints the date.
The second requests the reader to type three values representing the parameters of some triangle.
The third echoes the inputs as confirmation.
The last &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; statement contains a function reference, &lt;code&gt;area(b, c, angle)&lt;/code&gt;, which invokes the function. When it has been computed, the current &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; statement prints that area.
The definition of the function &lt;code&gt;AREA&lt;/code&gt; includes a &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; statement that lists the parameters required from the calling program, namely, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;angle&lt;/code&gt;. These parameters are defined in the next statement (&lt;code&gt;DECLARE&lt;/code&gt;).
The &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; statement also states the type of the result to be returned to the calling program, namely, a floating-point value. This is indicated by &lt;code&gt;RETURNS (FLOAT)&lt;/code&gt;.
The &lt;code&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt; statement contains the formula to be used in calculating the area of the triangle. It then returns control to the calling program. A &lt;code&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt; statement typically includes the name of a variable, but may include an expression (as is the case here).

===Scope===
The scope of PL/I variables is confined to procedures in which they are declared. The scope extends into any procedures contained within that procedure (except of course any procedures in which a new declaration of the same name occurs).

In the event that a variable is not declared, then the scope of that variable is the whole program. Again, if a declaration (for a variable of the same name) appears in a block that is subordinate to the one(s) where the variable is (are) used, then the scope is excluded from the block containing the declaration.

PL/I has two kinds of blocks. One is the &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; block that is used for subroutines and functions. The other is the &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; block (&lt;code&gt;BEGIN; ... END;&lt;/code&gt;). The &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; block behaves as a &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; block, except that a &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; block has no parameters nor does it have to have a label. It is entered in normal sequential execution, whereas a &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; block can be executed only by executing a &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; statement or function reference.

===Conditional Statements: IF..THEN..ELSE===
Consider the two examples of conditional statements:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
if a = b then c = d;
if a &gt; b then c = d; else c = e;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first example illustrates one optionally-executed statement &lt;code&gt;c = d;&lt;/code&gt;

The second example shows two optionally-executed statements, the first of which is executed when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and the second of which is executed if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; &lt;= &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;;

When multiple statements are to be executed conditionally, statement brackets &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; are used.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
if a &gt; b then
   do; p = q; r = s; end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Multi-branch Conditionals: SELECT===

The select-group offers a multi-branch evaluation,
it may be written in one of the 2 following syntax schemes:
# &lt;code&gt;SELECT ( var_or_expr ); WHEN ( val_1  ) unit_1; .... OTHERWISE unit_other; END;&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;SELECT ;                WHEN ( expr_1 ) unit_1; .... OTHERWISE unit_other; END;&lt;/code&gt;

A select-group of scheme type 1 has the form
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
SELECT ( var_or_expr );
   WHEN ( val_1 ) unit_1;
   ....
   WHEN ( val_n ) unit_n;
   OTHERWISE      unit_other;
END;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;code&gt;var_or_expr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;val_I&lt;/code&gt; ( &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; = 1..n ) may be variables or expressions.

&lt;code&gt;unit_I&lt;/code&gt; ( &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; = 1..n ) and &lt;code&gt;unit_other&lt;/code&gt; may be single statements or do-groups.

The select-group is evaluated as (pseudo code):
 Evaluate var_or_expr and store it to the variable TEMP.
 For I = 1 to n:
    Evaluate val_I,
    if the result equals TEMP: Execute unit_I and leave the select-group.
 Execute unit_other.

The &lt;code&gt;OTHERWISE&lt;/code&gt; clause (which may be abbreviated &lt;code&gt;OTHER&lt;/code&gt;) is optional,
but if this clause is omitted and none of &lt;code&gt;val_I&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;TEMP&lt;/code&gt; a run time error will occur.

A &lt;code&gt;WHEN&lt;/code&gt; clause may contain more than 1 value, e.g.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
SELECT ( my_char );
   WHEN ( '0' , '2' , '4' , '6' , '8' )
      put skip list ( 'character is an even digit' );
   WHEN ( '1' , '3' , '5' , '7' , '9' )
      put skip list ( 'character is an odd digit' );
   OTHERWISE
      put skip list ( 'character is no decimal digit' );
END;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A select-group of scheme type 2 has the form
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
SELECT;
   WHEN ( expr_1 ) unit_1;
   ....
   WHEN ( expr_n ) unit_n;
   OTHERWISE       unit_other;
END;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;code&gt;expr_I&lt;/code&gt; ( &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; = 1..n ) may be logical expressions or logical variables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;unit_I&lt;/code&gt; ( &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; = 1..n ) and unit_other may be single statements or do-groups.

The select-group is evaluated as (pseudo code):
 For I = 1 to n:
    if expr_I is true: Execute unit_I and leave the select-group.
 Execute unit_other.

An example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
SELECT;
   WHEN ( a &gt; b ) DO; call use_as_max ( a ); put skip list ( 'max = a' ); END;
   WHEN ( b &gt; a ) DO; call use_as_max ( b ); put skip list ( 'max = b' ); END;
   OTHERWISE      ; /* clause with empty statement to avoid run time error if a = b */
END;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Looping Statements===
The basic form of looping statement is:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do k = 1 to 10;
   &gt;&gt;body&lt;&lt;
end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The body of the loop is executed ten times, with control variable &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; taking the values from 1 through 10. On loop exit, the value of &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; is one increment more, namely 11. The loop extends to the next &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt; statement. Variations of looping statements are:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do k = 1 to n by 2;
do k = 20 to 1 by -1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Multiple iterative specifications may be used:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do k = 1 to 10, 20 to 100 by 5, 120 to 200 by 20;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
in which the loop will be executed with control variable &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; taking the values 1 through 10, then 20, 25, 30, 35, ... 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, and 200.

A loop that is conditionally terminated uses the &lt;code&gt;WHILE&lt;/code&gt; construct:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do while (a &amp;gt; b);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Such a loop is executed zero or more times, the test being performed at the beginning of the loop.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do until (a &amp;gt; b);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The loop specified by the above statement is executed at least once, the test being performed at the end of the loop.

In the following, a &lt;code&gt;REPEAT&lt;/code&gt; is used to specify an unusual change in the value of the control variable.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do k = 1 repeat k*i until (k &gt; 1000);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In this case, the control variable &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; takes on the values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; becomes greater than 1000.

The &lt;code&gt;REPEAT&lt;/code&gt; form:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do next = head repeat next &gt; link until (link = null);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
may be used to traverse a linked list.

&lt;code&gt;WHILE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UNTIL&lt;/code&gt; may be combined:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do while ( W ) until ( U ); ... end;
do until ( U ) while ( W ); ... end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
(both examples are equivalent, i.e. the order of &lt;code&gt;WHILE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UNTIL&lt;/code&gt; in the statement doesn't matter )

&lt;code&gt;DO I = ...&lt;/code&gt; may by followed by &lt;code&gt;WHILE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;REPEAT&lt;/code&gt; or both of them:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do I = 1 to 5 while ( W ); ... end;
do I = 1 to 5 until ( U ); ... end;
do I = 1 to 5 while ( W ) until ( U ); ... end;
do I = 1 to 5 until ( U ) while ( W ); ... end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
(the last two examples are equivalent)

Order of evaluation:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do I = 3 to 9 by 2 while ( W ) until ( U );
   ... some_statements ...
end;
put skip list ( 'I am ready' );
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

is evaluated as:
# &lt;code&gt;let I be 3&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;if I &gt; 9 then go to [7]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;if W = false then go to [7]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;   ... some_statements ...&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;if U = true then go to [7]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;let I be I + 2 and go to [2]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;put skip list ( 'I am ready' );&lt;/code&gt;

One more example: The following statement specifies that the do-group has to be executed eight times, with the value of I equal to 1, 3, 5, 9, 18, 36, 9, 18.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do I = 1 to 5 by 2,                      /* 1  3  5 */
       9 repeat 2 * I until ( I &gt; 20 ),  /* 9 18 36 */
       9 repeat 2 * I while ( I &lt; 21 );  /* 9 18    */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Boolean Values ===
In PL/I &lt;code&gt;bit (1)&lt;/code&gt; strings represents single boolean values:
* &lt;code&gt;'1'B&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'0'B&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Bit (1)&lt;/code&gt; strings may be used as boolean expressions in conditional and loop statements.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare   my_bit   bit (1);
   my_bit = ( 1 &lt; 2 );   /* now my_bit has the value '1'B */
   my_bit = ( 2 &lt; 1 );   /* now my_bit has the value '0'B */
   .....
   if my_bit then
      put skip list ( 'value of my_bit is true' );
   else
      put skip list ( 'value of my_bit is false' );
   do while ( my_bit );
      .....
   end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Boolean operators may be used for calculating new values:
* The prefix operator &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; is used as logical &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;.
* The  infix operator &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; is used as logical &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;.
* The  infix operator &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; is used as logical &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare   bit_a    bit (1);
declare   bit_b    bit (1);
declare   result   bit (1);
   result = ¬ bit_a;           /* result = '1'B if and only if bit_a is '0'B */
   result =   bit_a &amp; bit_b;   /* result = '1'B if and only if both bit_a and bit_b are '1'B */
   result =   bit_a | bit_b;   /* result = '0'B if and only if both bit_a and bit_b are '0'B */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Note: Using compile-time options &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt; operator and &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt; operator may be replaced by other symbols, for being compatible with existing PL/I programs often &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; is used as &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; is used as &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;.

===Error Handling/Recovery===
PL/I provides error detection and error handling.
Errors that are detected include
* floating-point overflow and underflow;
* fixed-point overflow;
* division by zero;
* subscript bound error;
* substring violation;
* string truncation.
* general errors.

The user can permit the system to report the error and perform a default action, or the user can specify a computational action to be executed when a given error is detected.

Events (including errors) are termed ''conditions''.

For a condition to be detected, it must first be enabled. If the condition is enabled, and the corresponding condition occurs, the corresponding &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt;-unit (if supplied by the user) is executed.

Consider the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
on overflow snap go to restart;
a = b * c;
...
restart:
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In the event that the product &lt;code&gt;b*c&lt;/code&gt; exceeds the maximum value permitted, the &lt;code&gt;OVERFLOW&lt;/code&gt; condition is raised, and the &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt;-unit for &lt;code&gt;OVERFLOW&lt;/code&gt; is executed. The &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt;-unit here is one of the simplest (&lt;code&gt;go to&lt;/code&gt;), and merely transfers control to the statement labelled &lt;code&gt;RESTART&lt;/code&gt; (where, perhaps, the program deals with the next set of values).

The keyword &lt;code&gt;SNAP&lt;/code&gt; causes the running program to print an error message, along with the statement number where the error occurred.

A more general example follows:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
(SUBSCRIPTRANGE):
a: procedure;
 declare x(10) float;
 declare (i, k) fixed binary;

 ON SUBSCRIPTRANGE SNAP BEGIN; PUT DATA (K); STOP; END;
 get list (k);
 do i = 1 to k;
    x(i) = 0;
 end;
end a;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In this example, the error detection and handling parts are shown in upper case.
Subscript checking is enabled by the condition prefix &lt;code&gt;SUBSCRIPTRANGE&lt;/code&gt; (parenthesised before the &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; statement).
Before any statements are executed, the &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; statement must be executed, which establishes the action to be carried out in the event of a subscript error.
The next statement executed is the input statement &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;, which reads in a value, say 12.
The loop is entered, and initializes ten values of x. On attempting to initialize &lt;code&gt;x(11)&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;SUBSCRIPTRANGE&lt;/code&gt; condition is raised, and causes the &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; unit &lt;code&gt;BEGIN; PUT DATA (K); STOP; END;&lt;/code&gt; to be executed. &lt;code&gt;SNAP&lt;/code&gt; causes an error message to be printed along with the statement number, and then statements within the &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; block are executed, namely the &lt;code&gt;PUT DATA&lt;/code&gt; statement, which prints &lt;code&gt;K = 11&lt;/code&gt;. The program then &lt;code&gt;STOP&lt;/code&gt;s. Some specific conditions are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| OVERFLOW
| exponent overflow
|-
| UNDERFLOW
| exponent underflow
|-
|FIXEDOVERFLOW
| fixed-point overflow
|-
| SIZE
| fixed-point overflow
|-
| ZERODIVIDE
| division by zero
|-
| SUBSCRIPTRANGE
| subscript bound error
|-
| STRINGRANGE
| substring error
|-
| STRINGSIZE
| truncation of a string
|-
| ENDFILE
| end of file
|-
| ENDPAGE
| end of page
|-
| ATTENTION
| request from keyboard
|-
|}

Some conditions are provided to handle everyday events, for example, end of file and end of page. For example, to print a page number on the top of each page:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
ON ENDPAGE PUT PAGE LIST('Page', Page_no);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To detect the end of the input file &lt;code&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt;, and to transfer to a named statement:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
ON ENDFILE(IN) go to next;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The programmer can invent his own conditions, and can signal them.

The &lt;code&gt;SIGNAL&lt;/code&gt; statement is provided to test a given &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt;-unit (error-handler) during program testing. For example, &lt;code&gt;SIGNAL ZERODIVIDE;&lt;/code&gt;
To raise a user-defined condition called &lt;code&gt;RANGE&lt;/code&gt;, the statement &lt;code&gt;SIGNAL CONDITION(RANGE);&lt;/code&gt; would be used.

===Containers===
&lt;List containers or references to lists of containers available natively for this language.  List ways to incorporate containers if they are not native to the language.&gt;

===Algorithms===
*[http://www.users.bigpond.com/robin_v/resource.htm Sort algorithms and an XML parser is provided by IBM for its compilers.]

===Garbage collection===
Any garbage collection is automatic.
All variables with the automatic attribute or allocated with the &lt;code&gt;automatic&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;code&gt;builtin&lt;/code&gt; are removed from storage at the end of the block where they are declared. All allocated storage (&lt;code&gt;ALLOC&lt;/code&gt; statement or &lt;code&gt;alloc builtin&lt;/code&gt;) is removed from storage at the end of the program.

===Physical Structure===
The libraries of the standard functions are all automatically provided; it is unnecessary to do anything to obtain access to them, such as to specify directories or to use &lt;code&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/code&gt; statements or the like.

===Tips===
*Source programs may be written in upper or lower case. There is no difference between the cases, except within strings.
*Varying strings (declared with the attribute &lt;code&gt;VARYING&lt;/code&gt;) are similar to C's char.

For an exact equivalant, in ''Enterprise PL/I for z/OS'' you may use the attribute &lt;code&gt;VARYINGZ&lt;/code&gt;, in which strings are zero-terminated.

Without the attribute &lt;code&gt;VARYING&lt;/code&gt;, strings are of fixed length. Such strings always store the specified number of characters. Thus,
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
DECLARE S CHARACTER(8);
S = 'abc';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
stores eight characters, namely, &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; followed by five blanks, whereas
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare V character(8) varying;
V = 'abc';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
requires a storage of 10 bytes: 2 bytes for the actual length of V and 8 bytes for the characters. This latter feature makes possible the assignment
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
V = V || 'dog';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
which appends the word dog to what is already stored in V (up to a maximum of 8 characters in this example, of course).

 Content of V after &lt;b&gt;V = 'abc';&lt;/b&gt;:
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 |   3   | a | b | c | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |   /* &quot;?&quot; means: value is undefined */
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
           1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8     /* index of character */

 Content of V after &lt;b&gt;V = V || 'dog';&lt;/b&gt;:
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 |   6   | a | b | c | d | o | g | ? | ? |   /* &quot;?&quot; means: value is undefined */
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
           1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8     /* index of character */

*
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare i fixed binary;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
is equivalent to C's &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare i fixed binary (31);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
is equivalent to C's &lt;code&gt;long int&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare i fixed binary (63);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
is equivalent to C's &lt;code&gt;long long int&lt;/code&gt;.

*Decimal arithmetic, because it is fixed-point, needs some care.

The built-in functions &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SUBTRACT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MULTIPLY&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;DIVIDE&lt;/code&gt; are provided to enable the programmer to specify the precision of each result. Thus they help to avoid overflow. For decimal fixed-point division, it is strongly recommended that the &lt;code&gt;DIVIDE&lt;/code&gt; function be used. Thus, to divide &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; has precision &lt;code&gt;(10,5)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; has precision &lt;code&gt;(6)&lt;/code&gt;, the recommended form is:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare A fixed decimal (10,5), B fixed decimal(6), C fixed decimal (10,5);
A = 12345.67891; b = 98765;
C = divide(A, B, 10, 5);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In the &lt;code&gt;DIVIDE&lt;/code&gt; reference, the arguments 10 and 5 direct that the result A/B has a total of ten digits, with 5 digits after the decimal point, respectively. This value is then stored in C. IBM PL/I permits up to 31 decimal digits for fixed-point working.

*When running PL/I programs, use the condition prefixes &lt;code&gt;SIZE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;STRINGRANGE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;STRINGSIZE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SUBSCRIPTRANGE&lt;/code&gt;, on the initial procedure statement thus:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
(SIZE, STRINGRANGE, STRINGSIZE, SUBSCRIPTRANGE):
trial: procedure options (main);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This enables checking for fixed-point overflow, and range-checking and truncation for strings and for subscripts.

*The lower bound of arrays is unity by default, not zero.

*Division of integers (whether decimal or binary or mixed) may produce a fixed-point result having a scale factor. Thus, 9/2 produces 4.5000000, unlike Fortran which produces the integer 4. Should an integer result be required, &lt;code&gt;TRUNC&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DIVIDE&lt;/code&gt; may be used, thus: &lt;code&gt;TRUNC(9/2)&lt;/code&gt; or - more generally - &lt;code&gt;DIVIDE(J, K, 31)&lt;/code&gt;, the latter giving 31 bits of precision for a binary integer result. Alternatively, declaring binary integer variables to have maximum precision (typically 31 bits) will ensure that the result of dividing two such integer variables will give an integer result.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This is a very small program that demonstrates that useful programs do not need to be large.  While toying with the idea of automated download and build of source included in Wikibooks I needed to test some [[../Regular Expressions|Regular Expressions]].  I searched the Web for ready made tools but found nothing that really fitted what I wanted to do.  Eric Gunnerson's C# tool is very good but relies on the .NET libraries which seems an unnecessarily large overhead for such a small program.  So I built my own in about fifteen minutes.  Here it is, it has the bare minimum of error checking, the controls are not neatly arranged and the form is not resizeable, or rather it is but the controls don't.  It has a lot of limitations and definitely needs improvement, see [[#Exercises|Exercises]].

==frmRegExpTester.frm==
This form is the only module in the program.  All the difficult work is done by the VBScript Regular Expression Library.  See  [[../Regular Expressions|Regular Expressions]].

The control layout on the form is just what first came to mind.  It definitely needs improvement in several areas: resizeability, tab order, etc.

There is a control for each of the properties and methods of the RegExp class so you can exercise all of the capabilities of it.  each of the controls reacts to the ''Changed'' ''Click'' events by setting properties as appropriate and calling both the ''Test'' and ''Execute'' methods.

The RegExp instance is available to all the code in this module although this is not strictly necessary because we could create a new one each time.
  
  Private moRe As RegExp
  
Each of the ''Boolean'' properties is represented by a ''CheckBox'' control.  The click event for each one simply sets the appropriate property value and calls the ''Execute'' method via the ''xExecute'' local subroutine.

  Private Sub chkGlobal_Click()
    moRe.Global = chkGlobal = vbChecked
    xExecute
  End Sub
  
  Private Sub chkIgnoreCase_Click()
    moRe.IgnoreCase = chkIgnoreCase = vbChecked
    xExecute    
  End Sub
  
  Private Sub chkMultiLine_Click()
    moRe.MultiLine = chkMultiLine = vbChecked
    xExecute  
  End Sub
  
When the form is created the ''Initialize'' event handler is called.  This creates the RegExp instance and sets the properties to correspond to the values of the controls.

  Private Sub Form_Initialize()
    Set moRe = New RegExp
    With moRe
      .Global = chkGlobal = vbChecked
      .IgnoreCase = chkIgnoreCase = vbChecked
      .MultiLine = chkMultiLine = vbChecked
      .Pattern = txtPattern
    End With  
  End Sub

When the user changes either the ''regular expression'' or the source text the output is updated by calling ''xExecute''

  Private Sub txtPattern_Change()
    xExecute
  End Sub
  
  Private Sub txtSource_Change()
    xExecute
  End Sub

This is the heart of the program.  All it does is to call the ''Execute'' method and then construct a string to represent the result.  If the ''pattern'' is invalid then the ''Execute'' method will raise an error.  this is trapped and the error description used instead of the result.  The result object is declared as ''Object'' because the return type can be either ''Match' or ''MatchCollection'' depending on whether there is only one match or more than one.  The results are shown in the ''txtExecuteResult'' and ''txtTestresult'' text boxes.  

  Private Sub xExecute()  
    moRe.Pattern = txtPattern
    Dim o As Object
    On Error Resume Next
    Set o = moRe.Execute(txtSource)
    If Err Then
      txtExecuteresult = Err.Number &amp; &quot;, &quot; &amp; Err.Description
    Else
      On Error GoTo 0
      If TypeOf o Is Match Then
        txtExecuteresult = xMatchToString(o)
      ElseIf TypeOf o Is MatchCollection Then
        txtExecuteresult = xMatchCollectionToString(o)
      End If
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0
      
    On Error Resume Next
    txtTestresult = moRe.Test(txtSource)
    If Err Then
      txtTestresult = Err.Number &amp; &quot;, &quot; &amp; Err.Description
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0
  End Sub

The whole purpose of the program is to show the user what the result of matching the regular expression to a text string will be.  To do this we simply create a string that represents a ''Match'' or MatchCollection'' object.
  
  Private Function xMatchCollectionToString(ByRef roMatchCollection As MatchCollection) As String
    
    Dim lX As Long
    With roMatchCollection
      xMatchCollectionToString = &quot;.Count:&quot; &amp; .Count &amp; vbCrLf
      For lX = 0 To .Count - 1
        xMatchCollectionToString = xMatchCollectionToString _
                                 &amp; &quot;Item &quot; &amp; lX &amp; vbCrLf _
                                 &amp; xMatchToString(.Item(lX))
      Next lX
    End With
    
  End Function
  
  
  Private Function xMatchToString(ByRef roMatch As Match) As String
    
    With roMatch
      xMatchToString = &quot;.FirstIndex:&quot; &amp; .FirstIndex &amp; vbCrLf _
                     &amp; &quot;    .Length:&quot; &amp; .Length &amp; vbCrLf _
                     &amp; &quot;     .Value:&quot; &amp; .Value &amp; vbCrLf _
                     &amp; &quot;.SubMatches:&quot; &amp; vbCrLf _
                     &amp; xSubMatchesToString(.SubMatches) &amp; vbCrLf
      
    End With
    
  End Function
  
  
  Private Function xSubMatchesToString(ByRef roSubMatches As SubMatches) As String
    
    Dim lX As Long
    With roSubMatches
      xSubMatchesToString = &quot;.Count:&quot; &amp; .Count &amp; vbCrLf
      For lX = 0 To .Count - 1
        xSubMatchesToString = xSubMatchesToString _
                            &amp; &quot;Item &quot; &amp; lX &amp; vbCrLf _
                            &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; .Item(lX) &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
      Next lX
    End With
    
  End Function

Exercises:
* Run the program and see if you can cause it to crash,
* Tidy up the user interface, add accelerator keys to aid navigation, fix the tab order,
* Think of a feature that might be worth adding and add it.

[[Image:OpenOffice.org Writer.png|thumb|OOo Writer]]OpenOffice.org's Writer is a very useful word processor. It is quickly becoming the standard for word processing. Writer's native file format is .odt, which is an open document format (Older versions of OOo used the native format .sxw). Saving in native format is always recommended even if you're planning to save it to another Office format like Word's .doc format, because this ensures that no formatting would be lost because of .doc's inability to save certain formatting elements. (more about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument Open Document Format])

== Tutorials ==

=== Your First Document ===

Open OpenOffice Writer. In Windows you can do this from the taskbar (if you set up quickstarter during install) or its program group. To open from the quickstarter right-click on the icon and select &quot;Writer&quot;. In Linux you can usually open it from the OpenOffice Writer Icon on the taskbar or dock, from its entry in your &quot;start&quot; menu, or with the shell command &quot;openoffice -writer &amp;&quot;.

Type &quot;Hello World&quot; and save. To save click on the disk icon or go File &gt; Save As... Save the document as hello.odt (if you are using 2.0.0 or 1.1.5) or hello.sxw (if you are using an older version). Don't worry about the extension. Just type the name you want and OpenOffice will automatically use its default extension. We will go over saving in different extensions later.

You have just completed your first document. That was easy, but OpenOffice writer has so much more to offer. Want to do more? Let's turn this document into an Adobe PDF file, a common method of distributing printed material over the internet.

=== Your First PDF ===

Open your first document, and check to make sure that you have a PDF viewer installed on your computer (you can [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html download one from Adobe] if you don't have one). You should have your document with &quot;Hello World&quot; written in it. Now go to File &gt; Export as PDF... and it should come up with the same window as before. Title it hello again, and click on &quot;Save&quot;. This will bring up the PDF Options window, and for now, all you'll need to press is &quot;Export&quot;. 
[[Image:OpenOffice.org2.2 Export to PDF.png|right|thumb|400px|Export dialog]]
The various PDF Options are:

* Range - Select either &quot;All&quot;, &quot;Pages&quot;, or (if you have highlighted certain text) &quot;Selection&quot;. This allows you to choose which pages to export as a PDF, usually all of them.

* Images - Informs OpenOffice.org how you want images compressed into PDF format. &quot;Lossless compression&quot; will be the best quality, but also the largest. &quot;JPEG compression&quot; produces lossy results, and it's according &quot;Quality&quot; option decides how 'liberally' the compression occurs. The &quot;Reduce image resolution&quot; brings the images DPI (Dots Per Inch) down, which could have an effect if the user zooms into an image, making it more pixelated.

* General - The &quot;Tagged PDF&quot; option produces a text document that is tagged, IE readable by screen readers for the disabled. To produce a properly formatted tagged PDF, you will have to use the internal stylizing of OOo, and not just concentrate on visual output. There is also &quot;Export Notes&quot;, which includes the notes on the document in the PDF while exporting. If you use transitional effects in your document, you can choose whether to leave them intact or not by checking the &quot;Use transition effects&quot; option. &quot;Submit forms in format&quot; only decides how the forms for the document will be formatted.

To learn more about PDF formatting and documentation options, look up the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF PDF Wikipedia entry].

=== Saving ===
'''saving a document for the first time'''
#Open openoffice writer, and the program starts.
#Click on the menu &quot;File&quot; , afterwards click on &quot;Save as&quot;
#Type a filename, in this example &quot;tree&quot;
#Hit the &quot;save&quot; button

'''checking which toolbars are enabled'''
#Click on the menu &quot;View&quot;, afterwards click on &quot;Toolbars&quot;, afterwards click on &quot;Standard&quot; (if it isn't already checked).

== Basic Formatting Options ==
If you've used Microsoft Word, or any of most other modern word processing programs, you will have no trouble with making basic formatting changes, such as in changing fonts or changing color. To change the formatting, you'll have to block the texts that you want to format, then click on the appropriate formatting buttons.

The formatting toolbar contains most of the formatting options needed for day-to-day usage. 
[[Image:OOoFormattingToolbar.png|The formatting toolbar.|frame|The formatting toolbar. If you can't find the toolbar, go to View &gt; Toolbar &gt; Formatting]]

Let's talk about things inside the formatting toolbar one by one.
''Tip: You can hover your mouse on the buttons on Open Office to know what each button do. ''

=== Style Control === 
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - SnF.png|right|frame]]
The leftmost button, is the '''Styles and Formatting''' Button. Click on it to show the Style and Formatting dialog. Next to it is a '''Style''' dropdown menu, which is basically a list of commonly used styles. Styles are basically predefined formatting,  which you can apply on a section of text. Style is also used to determine the structure of your writing. The great thing about using style is that if you change the formatting of a style, all elements in your document that previously applied that style would reflect the formatting change, saving you lots of time from changing them one by one. For now, just digest that, we'll talk more about styling in a moment, after we've finished with the toolbar.

=== Font Controls ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - FontCtrl.png|right|frame]]
The next two dropdown menus are for controlling '''Font Name''' (or Font Type or Font Face) and '''Font Size''' respectively. The '''Font Name''' dropdown, controls the type of font used whether it is &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Times New Roman';&quot;&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;&quot;&gt;Arial&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New';&quot;&gt;Courier New&lt;/span&gt;, or some other fonts you might have in your computer. The '''Font Size''' dropdown, as it says, controls how &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger;&quot;&gt;big&lt;/span&gt; or how &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;small&lt;/span&gt; your text looks like.

=== Standard Formatting Options (BIU) ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - BIU.png|right|frame]]
The next three buttons might be familiar. They are the friendly '''Bold''', ''Italic'', and &lt;u&gt;Underline&lt;/u&gt; buttons. If you've gotten more comfortable with OpenOffice, you can also use the shortcuts '''Ctrl+B''', ''Ctrl+I'', and &lt;u&gt;Ctrl+U&lt;/u&gt; for '''Bold''', ''Italic'', and &lt;u&gt;Underline&lt;/u&gt; respectively. You can also mix these formatting together, forming something like '''''BoldedItalic''''', &lt;u&gt;'''BoldedUnderline'''&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;''ItalizedUnderline''&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;'''''BoldedItalizedUnderlined'''''&lt;/u&gt;, etc.

=== Paragraph Alignment ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - Align.png|right|frame]]
Ok, now on to the next section. The next four buttons control the text alignment. There are four types of alignment:

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Align Left ====
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:OOo_-_FormattingToolbar_-_AlignLeft.png|right|frame]]
&quot;Align left&quot; ensures that your paragraphs' leftmost words form a line on the left side of the paragraph. This is the most used alignment, and thus the default alignment for a new blank document. The example of align left is this paragraph. You'll see that the leftmost words make a straight line, while the rightmost words are jagged.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Centered ====
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - AlignCenter.png|right|frame]]
A centered paragraph ensures that your paragraph would appear in the center. This is usually used for titles. You'll see that the length of the leftmost word to the left margin is equal to the length of the rightmost word to the right margin. This paragraph is an example of centered paragraph.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Align Right ====
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - AlignRight.png|right|frame]]
Align right ensures that your paragraphs' rightmost words form a line on the right side of the paragraph. This is usually used for signatures. The example of align right is this paragraph. You'll see that the rightmost words make a straight line, while the leftmost words are left uncontrolled as it fits.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Justified ====
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - AlignJustify.png|right|frame]]
Justify paragraphs is a combination of align right and align left. A &quot;justified paragraph&quot; would make the leftmost and the rightmost words make a line. To achieve this the spacings between the words or the character are usually adjusted. This is usually used to write in small columns, where the use of align left would make the columns look ugly. This paragraph is the example of justified paragraph.
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Bullets and Numbering ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - BnN.png|right|frame]]
The next two buttons, the '''Bullets''' and the '''Numberings''' button are for creating lists. If you click the '''Bullets''' button, a small circle would show up on the start of the paragraph your cursor is in, or on the start of each paragraph you're blocking. The same for '''Numbering''', although a number would show up instead of circle.

Finer control for making bullets and numbering can be found on the Bullet and Numbering Toolbar that would show up whenever your cursor is in a bulleted or numbered list. Feel free to explore what each of the buttons on the toolbar do.

There are also various collections of Bullets and Numbering style in '''Format &gt; Bullets and Numbering'''. Here, you can change the bullets and numbering into Roman Number, for example, or into alphabetical instead of plain number, or even a mix of them. You could even control more in depth by changing the settings on the Position Tab and/or Options Tab.

=== Indentation ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - Indent.png|right|frame]]
:The next two button controls the '''Indentation''', the first button move the indent to the left, while the second button would move it to the right. Indenting a paragraph would make your paragraph written  deeper into the paragraph or nearer to the paper's edge. You can also move the indentation marker on the ruler for finer movement. This paragraph, for example is indented.

=== Color Control ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - Color.png|right|frame]]
&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;
The last three buttons give you full control for colors. &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;The first button would change the font color, like this red text&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: cyan;&quot;&gt;the second button would highlight the text, like this cyan highlighted text&lt;/span&gt;, and the last button would change the background color, like this yellow-background paragraph. There are big differences between highlighting and background color, when changing the background color, you must change the background of the whole paragraph, while highlighting gives you more control for only highlighting certain part of the paragraph.
&lt;/div&gt;


===Shifting Case of letters===
Say you have a sentence &quot;the quick brown fox&quot; and you wish to change it to &quot;THE QUICK BROWN FOX&quot; without retyping it, that is to shift it from lower case to upper case.
Writer provides a quick way to do this by shifting the case of a highlighted selection. Just highlight the selection of text you want to shift the case of then right click on that text and in the right click menu select &quot;case/characters&quot; and then select Upper case to make every letter in your selction capital or lower case to make it all lower case.

== The Stylist ==
If you write longer texts, however, you will quickly discover that manually assigning formatting attributes to text can be a tedious task. It's hard to keep over fifty citations or some twenty Headings in exactly the same font face, font size, character spacing and so on. Thankfully, Writer has a tool to help you keep everything clean, simple and consistent.

The Stylist is a small box that contains lots of '''predefined formatting styles''' like &quot;Default&quot; or &quot;Heading 1&quot;. Let's work on the following example and use the stylist to touch up this chapter in Writer.

=== Preparation ===
To do this, we first need to copy this text to Writer, which is very easy using the clipboard. If you did not use the clipboard yet, just do the following: '''Select the text''' of this chapter, by positioning the mouse cursor at the start of the chapter, right before the heading (&quot;The Stylist&quot;), then hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse to the end of the chapter. The selected text becomes highlighted, indicating that whatever we decide to do now will influence this part of our document. Next we click on '''Edit &gt; Copy''' to place the selected text in the clipboard. To insert this text in Writer, we click in our document where we want to insert the example text, then choose '''Edit &gt; Paste'''. If everything went correctly, we will now have quite some text to work with. Now let's see what the Stylist can do for us.

=== Applying Styles ===
If you cannot see the Stylist yet, either choose '''Format &gt; Styles and Formatting''' or simply press '''F11'''. Among others categories, Writer differentiates between paragraph styles and character styles. We want to apply a paragraph style, so the default category, &quot;'''Paragraph Styles'''&quot; selected in the little toolbar at the top of the Stylist is just right.

Let's make the text a little easier to read and indent the first line of some paragraphs. To do this, we '''click somewhere in a paragraph''' that we want to apply a the new style to, then choose and '''double click''' the &quot;First line indent&quot; style. If everything worked alright, the first line of the selected paragraph is now indented.

&quot;Wait a moment!&quot;, you might say, &quot;Wouldn't it have been easier to just click on '''Format &gt; Paragraph''', then change the indentation?&quot; Yes, for one paragraph it might indeed have been easier, but what if you indented lots of paragraphs, then decide that things would look much nicer if all of your manually indented paragraphs should also be a bit separated from each other, as well as regular paragraphs? With styles, this is a breeze - we just '''change the style''' you applied to the paragraphs in question.

To change the &quot;First line indent&quot; style, '''right click it and select &quot;Modify&quot;'''. Switch to the &quot;Indents &amp; Spacing&quot; tab and change the value of the &quot;Above Paragraph&quot; spacing to something higher. Click OK and you will see that immediately all paragraphs that had the &quot;First line indent&quot; style applied are now spaced a bit apart.

But wait, there's more. Because styles help Writer see the '''logical structure''' of your document instead of just it's physical layout, it can act in a much more sensible way - a '''Heading means a lot more''' to Writer than just big, bold text. One example: If you used heading styles while laying out your text, inserting a camera-ready table of contents is a matter of four clicks: We choose '''Insert &gt; Indexes and Tables &gt; Indexes and Tables...''', then just accept the defaults by clicking OK. If your Browser conserved the headings in this text while copying it over to Writer you will see a brand-new table of contents in your document that lists all the headings in your text, along with their page numbers.

Let's try something and insert a new heading. Insert a new, short line of text somewhere in your document, click somewhere on that line, then double-click the &quot;Heading 1&quot; style to make this paragraph a new heading. Now let's have a look at our table of contents. If everything worked alright... ...nothing changed. Yes, that's right. If Writer were to constantly update a table of contents at the start of your text it would be continuously shifting up and down when the length of the table of contents changes. That's why it's only updated when you explicitly say so. So let's right-click the table of contents, then choose &quot;Update Index/Table&quot;. If everything worked out alright, you will immediately get a table of contents that reflects your recent changes to the text. Easy, huh?

This concludes our short introduction to the Stylist. Go ahead, have some fun with it - there's lots of things to discover. Like outline numbering (check '''Tools &gt; Outline Numbering...'''). Or styles for whole pages. Or - well, see for yourself!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=Guide to Unix/Echo1st|{{{1}}}=Guide to Unix/Echo2nd|1={{{2}}}|2={{{3}}}}}&lt;noinclude&gt;
==How to use==
The &quot;conditional&quot; template is a hack implementing a type of [[w:conditional statement]] for templates. One calls the template with a conditional tag like &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Conditional|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;condition&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;yes result&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;no result&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. If the condition is &quot;no&quot;, then the wiki software substitutes the conditional tag with the no result. For other conditions (such as &quot;yes&quot; or an arbitrary string different from &quot;no&quot;) the wiki software substitutes the conditional tag with the yes result.

Here are some example calls:
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Conditional|yes|''text A''|'''text B'''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is {{Guide to Unix/Conditional|yes|''text A''|'''text B'''}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Conditional|no|''text A''|'''text B'''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is {{Guide to Unix/Conditional|no|''text A''|'''text B'''}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Conditional|xyzzy|''text A''|'''text B'''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is {{Guide to Unix/Conditional|xyzzy|''text A''|'''text B'''}}

In the above examples, the conditional tag is useless, because the condition is already known. But the conditional tag can be placed in other templates such as [[Template talk:Guide to Unix/Clink|Clink]] where the condition is not known. This makes that [[m:Help:Template names, variable names and parameters depending on a variable or parameter|the template behave differently depending on its parameter]]. In particular, if a parameter to some template is &quot;no&quot; or defaults to &quot;no&quot;, then the template can behave differently by passing that parameter in the conditional tag. The conditional tag is a hack for an feature otherwise missing.

==How it works==
The conditional template consists of a single call to [[Template:Guide to Unix/Callno|&quot;callno&quot;]], but with a hack. The hack is very similar to the hack at [[m:Template talk:ine|&quot;ine&quot; on Wikimedia Meta]].

===Parameters specified twice===
Note that &quot;callno&quot; simply calls the template named by the &quot;no&quot; parameter. Also, callno passes template arguments 1 and 2 to the other template. Think of &quot;callno&quot; as a level of [[w:indirection]].
* So &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=stages}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stages}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The hack exploits the fact that a parameter can be called twice, which sets the second value.
* So &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=userpage|no=stages}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is not &lt;s&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{userpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/s&gt; but &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{stages}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

So instead of [[Template:Userpage]] we get [[Template:Stages]]. Here is the result of &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=userpage|no=stages}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;:
Unix
{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=userpage|no=stages}}

===Using callno to implement conditional===
It might seem that &quot;no&quot; is a strange name for a parameter. However, &quot;no&quot; is also the value to parameter 1 of &quot;conditional&quot; that makes conditional behave differently. Look at this call again:
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Conditional|no|''text A''|'''text B'''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is {{Guide to Unix/Conditional|no|''text A''|'''text B'''}}

We can use &quot;callno&quot; to have &quot;conditional&quot; to call [[Template:Guide to Unix/Echo1st|&quot;Echo1st&quot;]] and display text A in most cases, but to call [[Template:Guide to Unix/Echo2nd|&quot;echo2nd&quot;]] and display text B at a &quot;no&quot; condition. In the &quot;callno&quot; call, set parameter &quot;no&quot; to &quot;echo1st&quot;. This calls &quot;echo1st&quot; in most cases. Then set parameter &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; to &quot;Echo2nd&quot;. The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; refers to the parameter 1 of &quot;conditional&quot;, which is the condition. If the condition is &quot;no&quot;, this replaces the call to &quot;Echo1st&quot; with a call to &quot;Echo2nd&quot;. Otherwise, it sets some parameter which &quot;callno&quot; ignores (unless the parameter is 1 or 2, then it remains ignored because &quot;conditional&quot; replaces parameters by setting them after &quot;no&quot; and &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;).

==How to use==
The &quot;callno&quot; template calls the template named by the no parameter.
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=GFDL}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{GFDL}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

The parameters &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; can be passed through, but others cannot.
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=GFDL|p1|p2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{GFDL|p1|p2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

This template is part of a hack for [[Template:Guide to Unix/Conditional|&quot;conditional&quot;]].

===Errors===
If you see a red link to [[Template:Incorrect template call]] when using this template, then you forgot to set the &quot;no&quot; parameter.

How can I paint a  [[straight line]] (no-[[curve]]d) line in the [[GIMP]]?.
: I have found the answer, see: http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Straight_Line/
::Create a path, select a brush, stroke the path. [[User:Ojw|Ojw]] 21:04, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)
::Or, use you can use the SHIFT key with paint, pencil, airbrush, etc. [[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 23:10, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

== Written for 2.4 ==

How is the book written for a version of Gimp that is not even released as an unstable one?
--[[User:69.36.97.248|69.36.97.248]] 04:37, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

== Video of The Gimp. ==

The file [[Image:Bw photography gimp.ogg]] is a video showing how to convert to black and white with the gimp. Where can I put it? --[[User:OsvaldoGago|ogago]] 00:09, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

== Suggestion ==
A chapter on &quot;Gimp for the MS Paint user&quot; ??

I'm sure everyone knows how to use MS Paint. And switching to Gimp should start with the &quot;basics&quot;, like drawing straight lines, and so forth. --[[User:128.8.238.185|128.8.238.185]] 17:51, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

== Collaboration of the month people... ==

I know a lot about The Gimp.  Im not a professional, I have no training in PhotoShop or The Gimp, but I know how to use it after hours of playing with it.

I plan to add a few sections to the Contents page.  I would ask for opinions, but this page hasn't been updated in 5 days, so I know I won't get anywhere with that...
:Just make the additions that you want to add. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 06:44, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

== Let's include other guides ==


There are some guides for the Gimp around, and some of them are realised under a free license, like the documentation coming with the package and many more (see [http://www.gimp.org/tutorials]). What's the point of writing a new one from scratch?? we could include here all the tutorials that are GPLed; if they are not, we could try to ask the authors for the permission to put their guide here. Then we can start working on topics that those guides did not consider. What do you think about it?? [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 17:11, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

: While I would not agree with junking what is already here - a lot of people have already put a lot of work into it - if there is other content out there which would be of benefit being included, and is under the GNU FDL, then bring it in! - [[User:AmishThrasher|AmishThrasher]] 01:16, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

== Converting to black and white ==

I just wrote [[Photoshop/Converting to black and white]] and I'm sure The GIMP can do most of this. Feel free to use that article any way you like. (I'm working on illustrations now.) [[User:Fg2|Fg2]] 06:57, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

== Where to start? ==
Hello, new to wikibooks. Would like to help out with the GIMP wikibook but I'm unsure if there's any todo list, a wishlist, anyone in charge, or any sort of organizational plan at all? Just wondering where I should start. Thanks [[User:Qwuery|Qwuery]] ([[User talk:Qwuery|talk]]) 22:19, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

* There's a Todo box. You could try to write new article, or as wrote there about every tool in toolbox ( like [[GIMP/Gradient|here]] ), or expand existing artricles. There's a lot to do, just no one has written anything in todo list. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]] ([[User talk:Soeb|talk]]) 09:23, 8 July 2008 (UTC) &lt;sub&gt;Corrected the link [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:23, 3 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/sub&gt;

== Manual of Style ==

Shouldn't we make one? There are some general conventions, and I think those could be collected in one place. Like keys, lists, naming and such. It would make it easier for people to contribute.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This shows a typical image editing window in the GIMP (this is version 1.2, more recent versions will have a set of menus at the top of the image window)
&lt;!-- Once 2.8 is out, this needs a COMPLETE rework, as this was split into Saving (only xcf) and Exporting (all others) --&gt;
Right-click, ''File, Save'' is used to save the image.  A filetype can be selected ([[w:PNG|png]], [[w:JPEG|jpeg]], etc.) from the dropdown list, but the default action is to use whatever extension was typed (specifying &quot;image.jpg&quot; causes it to save a JPEG file)

After the filename is specified, there is an additional dialog box specific to each filetype.  For example, a JPEG image will ask you for the compression level, and it can be useful to adjust this until the image is a reasonable filesize.

===Image formats Supported by GIMP===
''as of GIMP 2.2.13''

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;

! File Format !! Extension(s) !! Description
|-
| XCF 
| .xcf/&lt;br /&gt;.xcf.gz/.gz/.xcfgz/ .xcf.bz2/.bz2/.xcfbz2/ .gbr/.gih/.pat
| GIMP's native format which will preserve all image data, including layer, the current selection, channels, transparency, paths and guides, but it doesn't save undo history. XCF images take up a lot of space, and are not supported by most image viewers, which is why XCF is only good for saving images for future editing (not for image exchange). There is also an option to compress the XCF by using either gzip (using xcf.gz/gz/xcfgz extension) or bzip2 (using xcf.bz2/bz2/xcfbz2 extension) compression. GIMP's other native formats include GIMP Brush (.gbr), GIMP Animated Brush (.gih), and GIMP Pattern (.pat).
|-
| BMP 
| .bmp/.dib
| '''B'''it'''m'''a'''p''' is an uncompressed image format, which is the internal image format for Windows and OS/2 Graphic Subsystem.
|-
| GIF 
| .gif
| '''G'''raphic '''I'''nterchange '''F'''ormat is often used for screenshots and computer graphics. It is lossless if the image has under 256 color or otherwise it become lossy.

|-
| JPEG 
| .jpg/.jpeg/.jpe
| '''J'''oint '''P'''hotographic '''E'''xperts '''G'''roup is typically used for photographs. It uses lossy compression that results in a loss of detail, commonly called artifacts. The artifacts are usually most noticeable on images that have sharp edges, while less noticeable on photographs, which have many smooth gradients.
|-
| PNG 
| .png
| '''P'''ortable '''N'''etwork '''G'''raphic is often used for screenshots and computer graphics. It uses lossless compression. It allows full alpha transparency.

=== GIF images ===
The Unisys patent has now expired and in recent versions of the GIMP you should be able to save compressed GIF images using GIMP.

If your version will not save GIF files and it is updated, you may want to update the corresponding image libraries for GIF.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Image Operations ===
Image operations not offered in the toolbox are accessed by right-clicking on the image. Since Gimp 2.0, there is also an option to display this menu at the top of the screen. (This option is now default)

Right-click on the image to access the menus.  For example, Right-click, '''File, Save''' is used to save the image in a variety of formats - for example PNG and JPEG formats are recommended for use on Wikipedia. To decrease a JPEG's filesize, adjust the ''Quality'' slider when you save.  If doing this it may be helpful to tick the ''Show preview in Image Window'' checkbox, tthe file size will be calculated and the loss of quality can be inspected.

Often, it's useful to get info on an image you're editing. To do this, right-click on the image to bring up the menu, and then choose '''Image &gt; Image Properties''', or hit '''Alt-Enter'''. The first three properties are very important for printing: Pixel Dimensions, Print Size, and Resolution.
[[File:GIMP_info.png|thumb|400px|An Image Properties box.]]

'''Image &gt; Canvas size''' is used to adjust the size of image dimensions, but does not attempt to scale the image.  

'''Image &gt; Scale image''' is used to change the size of the image, for example to create [[w:thumbnail|thumbnail]] images.

To remove a section of image, just select it (using one of the select tools) and press Control-K (&quot;kill&quot;, same as using '''Edit &gt; Clear''').  This will either erase the selection to the background colour, or to transparency if the image supports it.

      <comment>/* Colour Modes */ filesize for indexed images, RLE BMP</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">GIMP can understand a number of different colour formats with a varying degree of support. It supports three so called ''modes'': RGB, grayscale, and indexed.

To change the mode of the image, choose in the menu from ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Image &gt;  Mode &gt; ....

==Colour Modes==
GIMP supports the following color modes:

* '''True Colour (RGB):''' This has the best support in GIMP. It is made up from 3 channels of 256 tonal variants, making a total of 16.7 million colours - 256 * 256 * 256. &lt;p&gt;Supported formats: XCF, PNG, TGA, TIFF, SGI, BMP.
* '''Grayscale:''' The grayscale mode uses one channel to display a gray image. GIMP supports grayscale well and is usable for most tools that don't specifically require colour information.&lt;p&gt;Supported formats: XCF, PNG, TGA, TIFF, SGI.
* '''Indexed:''' In this mode, the image consist of pixels picked from a palette of up to 256 colours.&lt;p&gt;When you convert an image into this mode, or when you are reducing the color depth of an image, dithering options give you control over how colours are scattered. For the best quality results (especially with pictures that have gradual tonal variance) use ''Floyd-Steinberg'' dithering: it will give a grainy texture to the picture, but reduce visible banding between different colours. On the other hand, reduced or no dithering will result in smaller files when saved as GIF or PNG (or BMP with the ''Run-Length Encoded'' option set).&lt;p&gt;Supported formats: XCF, PNG, GIF, BMP.
*'''Monochrome''': Two colours, often black and white. GIMP sees this as an indexed image with only 2 colours. &lt;p&gt;Supported formats: XCF, PNG, GIF, BMP.

Menu items for color modes:
* Image &gt; Mode &gt; RGB
* Image &gt; Mode &gt; Grayscale
* Image &gt; Mode &gt; Indexed

==Alpha Channel==

Regardless of the mode, images can have an optional alpha channel for transparency. An image with an alpha channel can have transparent and semitransparent pixels, the degree of transparency of each pixel ranging from 0 to 255. Using transparency enabled by alpha channel, you can create a picture by stacking several layers on top of each other, save images for the web, or create images for 3D graphics that have holes or semi-opaque areas.

Formats that fully support alpha channel: XCF, PNG, TIFF, TGA, SGI. Formats that only support alpha channel as fully opaque or fully transparent: GIF, XPM.

&lt;!-- Chelseafan528: AFAIK --&gt;Only Internet Explorer versions later than version 7 support transparency. Internet Explorer 6 and earlier do not.

Menu items for alpha channel:
* Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Add Alpha Channel
* Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Remove Alpha Channel
* Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Add to Selection

==Colour Filter/Tools==
''Image, Mode, Decompose'' will split a colour image into a set of greyscale images, based on various colour models. ''Image, Mode, Compose'' does the opposite, combining greyscale images into colour ones. Striking effects may be obtained by recombining channels in a different model or order than they were decomposed in.

A number of colour adjustments can be found under ''Image, Colours'', and colour effects under ''Image, Filters, Colours''

'''Okara''' is a spongy, crumbly by-product of the [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] and [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]]-making process.  While it is edible, it has little nutritional value and doesn't appeal to the palates of most people.

However, it can be made both more palatable and more nutritious by fermenting into ''tempe gembus'', a form of [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]] made from okara.</text>

I love the work you've done, but I'm going to move the course and the title to 4500 or something like that.  I don't like the idea of diffrentiating between Casual and Non, as if  the other classes were really hard.  We won't be setting classes apart like that around here.

Thanks for all of your hard work and I'm glad you put yourself down in faculty!
[[User:Atrivedi|Atrivedi]]


Yo- Get that negative crap out of the SLES talk page!  You've designed a good course! In fact, it's so good that it shouldn't be made to sound inferior to the rest!  I put it with the other courses because it deserves to be there!  Buck up!  :)  [[User:Atrivedi|Atrivedi, SLES]]</text>

==Proposal to use Slash Convention==
I propose renaming the pages to slash convention. (For example, [[Bourne Shell Scripting Modularization]] would become [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Modularization]].) This will generate links from the chapters up to the main page ([[Bourne Shell Scripting]]). See [[WB:NP]] for examples. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:15, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

Also, the chapter I added, [[Bourne Shell Scripting Interactive Conditionals and Loops]], I would rename to just [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Loops]]. The long name is too confusing. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:15, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

== Daily shell ==

Hello,

Great WikiBook! ;) I'd love to see a &quot;daily usage&quot; or &quot;command line&quot; chapter. There is so much to learn about interactive bash. I would, gladly, help out with content.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Reversi/Contents|Back to Contents]]

Reversi and Othello are strategic boardgames which involve play by two parties on an eight-by-eight square grid with pieces that have two distinct sides. Pieces typically appear coin-like, with a light and a dark face.

Mattel produces Reversi equipment under the name &quot;Othello&quot;. Anjar Co licenses the registered trademark &quot;Othello&quot; from Tsukuda Original.

The best Othello computer programs can easily defeat the best humans. As early as 1980, the program The Moor beat the reigning world champion, and in 1997, Logistello defeated the human champion Takeshi Murakami 6:0. This dominance is not seen in games like chess, where the best computers are about equal to the best humans (although the Hydra machine may soon change that), or Go, where even average human players trounce the best computers.

Human beings cannot generally win against computer intelligence in Othello because computers can look ahead much further than humans can. Analysts have estimated the number of legal positions in Othello as at most 1028, and it has a game-tree complexity of approximately 1058. Othello still remains unsolved, however - we don't know the result of the game with perfect play on both sides.

When generalizing Othello to play on an n-by-n board, the problem of determining if the first player has a winning move in a given position is PSPACE-complete.

The game pieces flip very quickly, easily and (often) repeatedly, so it offers little advantage -- and in fact typically becomes disadvantageous -- to try to gain a majority of pieces early in the game.  Corners, mobility, edge play, parity, endgame play and look-ahead form the key elements of successful Othello strategy.

===Board===

Fig. 1 The board layout.

The game has 8x8 squares with the starting position shown. Each square has a name (top left corner square is a1).

Fig. 2 The named squares.

There are some squares players have named:
     Corner pieces (a1,h1,a8,h8)
     X-squares (b2,g2,b7,g7)
     C-squares (a2,b1,g1,h2,h7,g8,b8,a7)
     B-squares (c1,f1,h3,h6,f8,c8,a6,a3)
     A-squares (d1,e1,h4,h5,e8,d8,a5,a4)
     Edge-pieces are piece in the outer rows or columns (a1 to h1) (a8 to h8) (a1 to a8) (h1 to h8)
     Sweet-16 are the center 16 squares (c3 to f3, c4 to f4, c5 to f5, c6 to f6)
     Black-diagonal is the diagonal a8 to h1
     White-diagonal is the diagonal a1 to h8

===Corners===

Corner positions, once played, remain immune to flipping for the rest of the game: thus a player can use a piece in a corner of the board to anchor groups of pieces (starting with the adjacent edges) permanently.  So capturing a corner often proves an effective strategy when the opportunity arises.  More generally, a piece is stable when, in all four directions, it is on a boundary, in a filled row, or next to a stable piece of the same color.

===Mobility===

An opponent playing with reasonable strategy will not so easily relinquish the corner or any other good moves.  So to achieve these good moves, you must force your opponent to play moves which relinquish those good moves.  The best way to achieve that involves reducing the number of moves available to your opponent.  If you consistently restrict the number of legal moves your opponent can make, then sooner or later they will have to make an undesirable move.  An ideal position involves having all your pieces in the center surrounded by your opponent's pieces.  In such situations you can dictate what moves your opponent can make.

When moves seem equal with respect to what moves you will leave yourself and your opponent, playing a minimum piece strategy will tend to advantage you, because minimizing your discs will tend to leave fewer discs for your opponent to flip in subsequent moves of the game.  One should not play the minimum disc strategy to an extreme, however, as this also can quickly lead to a lack of mobility.

===Edges===

While playing pieces to edges of the board may seem sound (because they cannot be flipped easily), this can often prove detrimental.  Edge-pieces can anchor flips that influence moves to all regions of the board.  Because of that, this can, sooner or later, poison later moves that you make by causing you to flip too many pieces and open up many moves for your opponent.  However sometimes playing to an edge where your opponent cannot easily respond to will leave that opponent with significantly fewer available moves.

The square immediately diagonally adjacent to the corner (called the X-square), when played in the early or middle game, typically guarantees the loss of that corner.  Playing to the edge squares adjacent to the corner can typically lead to tactical traps involving sacrificing one corner, or simply playing out the edge in a specific sequence.

In general you should avoid edge play in the early and middle game if possible, unless you can gain larger concessions in terms of mobility or a mass of unflippable pieces.

===Parity===

As play progresses, regions of the board will typically section themselves off where neither side can prevent the other from playing arbitrarily into those regions.  By simply counting out the number of squares in a region, one can ascertain whether an odd or an even number of squares exist.  In the case of an odd number of squares, by playing there first you can force your opponent to play first outside of that region.  You achieved this by simply playing into that region at any time it has an odd number of squares available, and by not playing into it when it features an even number of squares.  If you take into consideration certain squares in a region that seem very dangerous (like an X-square or an edge square that leads to an obvious trap) then you can either force your opponent to play elsewhere or to occupy one of these dangerous squares.

===Look-ahead===

As in any good strategy for [[chess]] or for [[checkers]], a player should not consider only the current situation on the board.  For each move you consider, you must consider possible responses from your opponent, then the subsequent responses you will make to those moves and so on.  The aspects of the current position may not remain relevant a few moves hence.  So when optimizing your mobility, gaining corners or anything else, you should consider how best to do this for the long term rather than just for the next move.

===Endgame===
For the endgame (the last 20 or so moves of the game) the strategies will typically change.  Special techniques such as sweeping, gaining access, and the details of move-order can have a large impact on the outcome of the game. At these late stages of the game no hard-set rules exist.  The experienced player will try to look ahead and get a feel for what will lead to the best final outcome.

Each of the two sides corresponds to one player; we will call them ''light'' and ''dark'' after the sides of Othello pieces, but &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot; would identify them equally as well, so long as each marker has sufficiently distinctive sides.

Originally, Reversi did not have a defined starting position.  Later it adopted Othello's rules, which state that the game begins with four markers placed in a square in the middle of the grid, two facing light-up (indicated by o in our diagrams), two pieces with the dark side up (indicated by x). The dark player makes the first move.

   ox
   xo  (one of the possible starting positions)

Dark must place a piece with the dark side up on the board, in such a position that there exists at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) line between the new piece and another dark piece, with one or more contiguous light pieces between them. In the above situation, dark has the following options indicated by dots:

   .
  .ox
   xo.
    .

After placing the piece, dark turns over (flips, captures) all light pieces lying on a straight line between the new piece and any anchoring dark pieces. All reversed pieces now show the dark side, and dark can use them in later moves -- unless light has reversed them back in the meantime.

If dark decided to put a piece in the topmost location (all choices are strategically equivalent at this time), one piece gets turned over, so that the board appears thus:

   x
   xx
   xo

Now light plays. This player operates under the same rules, with the roles reversed: light lays down a light piece, causing one or more dark pieces to flip. Possiblities at this time appear thus (indicated by dots):

  .x.
   xx
  .xo

Light takes the bottom left option and reverses one piece:

   x
   xx
  ooo

Players take alternate turns. If one player cannot make a valid move, play passes back to the other player. When neither player can move, the game ends. This occurs when the grid has filled up, or when one player has no more pieces on the board. The player with more pieces in the board at the end wins.

One difference between Reversi and Othello involves the supply of pieces. In Reversi each player owns 32 pieces at the start of the game.  Once a player has placed 32 pieces (including the initial 2 pieces placed on the centre squares) that player may not make any further moves.  He/she may not use any of the opponent's pieces.  In Othello all the pieces belong to both players equally; they come from a pool, from which both may draw in order to make a move.

The game derives from two different sources.

In the 19th century unknown authors in Europe invented &quot;Reversi&quot;, which the well-known German games publisher Ravensburger started producing in 1898 as one of its first titles.

The modern rule set, now universally accepted (except by those who know only the still-produced Ravensburger edition) originated in Japan as &quot;Othello&quot; in the 1970s.

Goro Hasegawa, who wrote How to win at Othello, popularised the game in Japan in 1975. It took its name from the Shakespearean play Othello, the Moor of Venice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This page is for bookshelf requests. See [[Wikibooks:Bookshelves]] for why this page exists.''

==Fix computer-related bookshelves==
I, [[User:Kernigh]], am seeking a consensus on how to handle the six computer-related bookshelves. These are:
*[[Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf]]
*[[Wikibooks:Computer science bookshelf]] (Comp sci)
*[[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf]]
*[[Wikibooks:Domain-specific languages bookshelf]]
*[[Wikibooks:Information technology bookshelf]] (IT)
*[[Wikibooks:Programming languages bookshelf]]

These are the concerns that I have:
# It seems there is some confusion over the difference between &quot;Computing&quot; and &quot;Information technology&quot;. I decided that &quot;Computing&quot; was for using software and &quot;Information technology&quot; for other topics (currently certification and hardware). Thus, after my several recent edits to Computing bookshelf, mostly to sort books, I listed two books as &quot;move to IT bookshelf&quot;, which are [[Embedded Systems: Theory, Design and Implementation]] and [[GCSE Short Course ICT]]. ''I have not moved the two books yet.''
# I think that several books at the IT bookshelf (such as [[Computer Hacking]], linked as &quot;Hacking&quot;) actually belong at Computing. None of these books are actually at the IT bookshelf, they are only at [[Template:IT bookshelf]]. I would move Hacking, [[Use the Source]] (linked as &quot;A Look at Open Source&quot;), [[Web Design]], and maybe [[Weblogs]] (is Weblogs about certification?) to Computing. I would move [[XML]] to Domain-specific languages, but there is already a book there linked as &quot;XML&quot; called [[Programming:XML]]. I would move [[Emulation]] to the Computer games bookshelf.
# I do not like that the Comp sci and IT bookshelves include books from the Programming and Domain-specific languages bookshelves. This causes a need for books to have titles and stages listed at three different places.
# [[WB:B|The bookshelf policy]] and [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]] have different lists. In particular, the all-bookshelves page does not know about the computer game bookshelf, while the policy page does not know about the programming and domain-specific languages bookshelves.
# The difference between &quot;Computing&quot; and &quot;IT&quot; is arbitrary.

'''This is what I suggest doing:'''
# Move books between Computing and IT as I described above.
# Remove the languages books from both the Computing and IT bookshelves.
# Remove the list of bookshelves from [[WB:B|the policy]] and update the list at [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]].
# Clean the IT bookshelf so that anything listed on its template, that was not removed, is also listed on the bookshelf page.
# Create {{tl|computer shelves}} with a list of the six bookshelves. (I currently have a list of three near the top of [[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf]].) Include the template near the top of the Computing and IT bookshelves so that users going to those more generic bookshelves will find the correct bookshelf.

I think that numbers 4 and 5 are easy, but 1 and 2 may confuse users that see books disappear and 3 requires changing a policy. Thus I am seeking comments and alternate options. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:34, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Adding support for Per Datablock Properties Proposal==
A Draft, proposing the addition of user defined, per datablock properties.
&lt;br&gt;
This means that any blender datatype with an ID should be able to have properties assigned to it.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Object/Mesh/Camera/Metaballs/Lamp/Lattice/Text/IPO/Screen/Scene/World/Wave''' - This does not include faces or verts for the moment. This may be added later but would require further work and is outside the scope of this proposal.


There are some areas I do not know enough about and request others to expand.

I encourage others who may benefit from this, to read through this page and see if there are any improvements that could be made '''(edit, give examples and discuss :) )''' - Ideasman

=== Discussion ===

----
'''Message from Ton'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
About the property system, what needs to be sorted out is;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- how it influences the UI&lt;br&gt;
- how does hierarchical work precisely? (also for UI access)&lt;br&gt;
- is there a way to default to property sets? Means;
&lt;br&gt;
you can set custom properties to be added by default for yafray, crystalspace, etc.
&lt;br&gt;
Would save a lot of hassle, and would create good accessible UIs that way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

----

- I'm busy and haven't time for all these now, - Ideasman


----

''' Reed Hedges says: '''

In response to Ton's questions above, here's what I think: In the UI, you need to add something in some pane that's exactly like the existing gamelogic properties (name, value, type {string,bool,int,float,vector,etc.}). This could be a new window type instead of the game logic window or it could be in the buttons window with the Object-level operations, or it could be part of the Outliner view.  From what I read below, it looks like the hierarchical naming is primarily a naming convention. This could be used by the UI to display as a tree, or they could just be a standard list with the &quot;hierarchies&quot; just in the name format. To me, default properties are not useful. However, they could be a separate mode of the same gui used for individual objects.

 +-CUSTOM PROPERTIES -------------------------------------+ 
 |                                                        |
 | Selected Object: ME:Suzanne01               (Defauts)  |  &lt;-- (Defaults) is a two-state toggle button
 |                                                        |      to show default props instead of sel. object
 | Name:               Type:    Value:               Del: |   
 |  [Example.Prop....] (String) [This is my stri...] (X)  |  &lt;-- Name is text field. Type is multivalue
 |  [Another.example.] (Bool  ) (true)               (X)  |      dropdown. Value depends on type.
 | (New)                                                  |  &lt;-- (New) creates a new empty property above it.
 +--------------------------------------------------------+
 

I would also request that all object types be able to have properties, including the Scene/World.
''(Yep, Scene &amp; World will since they have ID's - Ideasman42)''

----

===Applications===
#'''Annotations''' Comments about a mesh, object or material could be stored as a link to a text block or a string. Other metadata might also be added for different projects.
#'''Render Settings''' Extra Properties for external rendering engines, may of these could be added to the material data, and global render settings could be assigned to the Scene datablock. ''This could be a step towards better renderman intergration!''
#'''Game Engine'''  Many game engine specific settings such as Level Of Detail for objects. Different pose states for figures. could be stored in these settings.
#'''Blender CAD''' Many attributes could be added for use in the BlenderCAD project. '''(please expand)'''
#'''Simulation''' There is a gap to be filled in the simulation industry, there are a number of people already using blender in simulation, however there is no easy way to add settings for Simulation output (Namely OpenFlight Properties)
#'''Extended datas''' some internal functionalities may need to store values, while not wanting to impose the added weight to all datablocks, even those who don't need it
#* Comment: Allow users to mess with data that's accessed by internal functions as well is not a good idea. If it's useful for internals at all (I can't think of a situation where I wouldn't prefer another implementation) user data and Blender data should be separated or access restricted (read-only for Blender stuff). -- tbleicher
#* Answer to comment : it is not because you use properties mechanism that it must be user editable or even viewable. that case is useful when you need broad datas added in very few cases like a tiny percent of edges on a whole mesh
#* (by Ideasman) Guys, Id like to resolve this, feel free to disagree, but a line has to be drawn as to the functionality this project covers.
#**'''1)''' Users must be able to edit properties directly, there will be an interface for this. Blenders internal tools can manage properties also but there will be a panel just for datablock properties.&lt;br&gt;You could argue that letting the user touch them introduces possible errors in the data, but the advantages of allowing the user edit the properties far outweigh the effort of making python-scripts/blender correctly handle a variety of data.
#**'''2)'''Properties will not be assigned to edges, bezier points, faces, indervidual bones etc. This is out of the scope of this project. If there is a need for pre mesh face properties for e.g., we can address this as a separate addition. for now only data with an ID struct will have custom properties.
#'''Blender BVH Motion Capture''' Joint names could be assigned as properties so that duplicate object names would not conflict between different motion capture rigs. At the moment I am making all joint names unique because there is no good way to set the objects goint name. (Ideasman)

===Defaults===
For default settings a text file could be used in the home directory called '''.Bprops'''
&lt;br&gt;
Existing files files are '''.B.blend''' for the default new file and '''.Bfs''' for a list of default dirs in the fileselector.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The '''.Bprops''' text file would store properties that would be shown by default (without manually adding to the datablock)
&lt;br&gt;
DataBlockType:PropertyType:PropertyName=DefaultValue - Would be the following format.
&lt;pre&gt;
Object:bool:CrystalSpace.staticObject=1
Material:Text:RenderMan.Shader=&quot;&quot;
Scene:int:RenderMan.Quality=5
Lamp:bool:OpenFlight.LightString=0
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''NOTE''' from the perspective of b2cs (crystalspace exporter), not only defaults would be useful, but also minimum, maximum and possibly even a description for each property.

===Example Usage===
''Here are projects that may directly benefit from properties, appretiate input from authors and expansion on how this might benefit their project. Does this proposal furfill your needs?''
#'''Blight''' (openflight compatibility- storing openflight spesific notes)
#'''Make Human'''(make human, per mesh humen settings...)
#'''Brad'''  Blender/Radiance Exporter (material settings...)
#*material: save description as text string; save dependencies on other definitions (&quot;modifiers&quot;) 
#*mesh: use props for &quot;special&quot; export objects instead of meshobj names 
#*lamps: strore reference to luminaire data and used data source (db, fs)
#*scene: render options and post process information (filters, image conversion)
#'''CrystalSpace'''  OpenSource Game engine.
#'''RenderMan''' Adding RenderMan support to Blender.
#*shader: specify shader name and parameters for RenderMan shaders (surface, displacement...)
#*primitives: provide hints to RenderMan exporter for processing specific primitives.
#*scene: provide hints to RenderMan exporter for scene level rendering control.
''Add your project here''

===Property Structure===
Properties will be stored in a hierarchy. each datablock can any number of property folders
&lt;br&gt;(I'm proposing no root level properties to enforce better design)
&lt;br&gt;
A plugin that used properties would have a folder in the root for all its settings- This would stop it from getting messy in the UI, and keep namespace separate for each plugin.
&lt;br&gt;
Example structure. python can wrap the C data and access as a dict or as a class we may allow both to coexist ob.prop.foo or ob.prop['foo'] - Ideasman42),
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
object.prop.metadata.annotation = 'This is a building' # string
object.prop.metadata.timestamp = sys.time() # float
object.prop.crystalSpace.lod = Mathutils.Vector(0,50) # vec
object.prop.crystalSpace.shadowMap.used = True # bool
object.prop.crystalSpace.shadowMap.size = 512 # int
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

===Property Types===
Here are a list of property types that could be used by plugins.

#'''bool'''
#'''Int'''
#'''Float'''
#'''String''' ''May be limited in size, for large multiline texts a text block could be linked.''
#'''Vector''' (2D, 3D, 4D)
#'''Datablock link''' Would allow you to link to another datablock- text/object/mesh/curve etc.
#'''Arrays''' of all previous values (not a requirement, since a folder of properties could be used, could be useful)

===User Interface===
The OOps view can be extended to have a panel that would allow editing of each datablocks properties.
This could also be viewable in the outliner, however OOps view is better suited because it shows each datablock only once. and shows all datablocks at the same time.

===Python API Interface===
*Comment 1: For scripting more important than accessing and editing the whole set of properties will be the access to individual props by name/hierarchy. For BPy I'd like to have an implementation of __getitem__/__setitem__ (like in dictionaries). Examples:
**amesh.prop[&quot;Radiance&quot;][&quot;export&quot;][&quot;smooth&quot;] = True # set the property, bool
**var= amesh.prop[&quot;Radiance&quot;][&quot;export&quot;][&quot;smooth&quot;] # get the property
**amesh.prop[&quot;Radiance&quot;][&quot;export&quot;].keys() # get a list of sub properties.&lt;br&gt;[&quot;smooth&quot;, &quot;emit_light&quot;]
**del amesh.prop[&quot;Radiance&quot;][&quot;export&quot;][&quot;smooth&quot;]
&lt;i&gt;KeyError&lt;/i&gt; should be raised whenever a non-existent key is specified (or an existing key is converted to &quot;container&quot;). How to check this and react is the job of the script.
*Comment 2: To import/export the property set a universal way to serialize the data would be wellcome. Currently we have to use the Python standard library to store/read runtime data from the Registry/text objects/text files. A builtin way to create/parse text strings from/to Python objects could help script writers to load and save persistent data. That way the whole properties set could be stored as a string attribute of the object.
-- tbleicher

(comment: Python's pickle module provides this, though I don't know how this might interact with Blender objects, etc. -- sapir)

===Internal Implementation===
Any Blender Data with an ID would be able to have a property. (please expand and add to how this may be implemented - in Blenders DNA)

===User data already sort of exists for objects?===
Sorry, I just came upon this page searching the web trying to figure out how to add user data to objects in Blender.  Couldn't find anything in my searches, but finally figured out some stuff from the API docs.

Try these in Blender's Python interactive console:&lt;br&gt;
cube = bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;]&lt;br&gt;
cube.addProperty(&quot;myUserDataName&quot;, 1, 'INT')&lt;br&gt;
dir(cube.getProperty(&quot;myUserDataName&quot;))&lt;br&gt;
var = cube.getProperty(&quot;myUserDataName&quot;).data&lt;br&gt;
cube.getProperty(&quot;myUserDataName&quot;).setData(2)&lt;br&gt;
cube.getAllProperties()&lt;br&gt;
cube.removeProperty(&quot;myUserDataName&quot;)&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting started ==

I am new to Wiki Books. I welcome advice.  I have an idea for a Wiki Book but I'm not sure it fits the policies.  It is not actually a text but a guide to resources for kids with behavioral/emotional/psychiatric problems.  I want to find out if this is OK.

== Your contributions==

Youa asked about finding one of your contributions about Costa Rica.  Did you see the &quot;my contributions&quot; link on the top of the page.  I had a look and could not find anything about you adding to costa rica.  Remember that you are given a preview before changes are saved.  Is it possible that you forgot to save your changes? [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 04:46, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== Your book ==

I am certainly no authority but starting a ''guide'' seems reasonable to me.  There is not procedure for getting something approved so you can just go ahead.  In the event there are objections there is a process to suggest deletion, and you will have time to take what you have written elsewhere. Good luck and have fun. [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 04:48, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== How to add &quot;meta comments&quot; about templates ==

You are asking how to demonstrate the use of a template in a discussion.  Since this is a meta-meta discussion, it is going to be even harder to demonstrate, but you can use the &quot;edit&quot; feature to see how I did this, so it shouldn't be too difficult to just see what I'm doing.

There is an HTML markup tag that you can use in your writing called &quot;nowiki&quot; as in &amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;, which you can then use to do something like this:

&quot;If you wish to have this page marked for deletion, all you need to do is add the template '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|&lt;state your reason here&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' somewhere in the module that you are editing, preferably at the top of the page.&quot;

----

I hope this is useful to you on how to do discussions about templates without actually using them.  You can also look for more information at [[m:Help:Editing#Just show what I typed]] for more details and other things you can do like this.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:34, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

== Internal Squabble about Wikbooks ==

I want to thank you for your comment about how you feel about Wikibooks and this change in policy.  I hope you don't mind, but I posted the comment on the Foundation-L mailing list, as I think it is very representative of the attitude here on Wikibooks by its participants.

BTW, I did get a reply (of a sort) from Jimbo, but he seems to be fanning the flames rather than trying to put out this fire.  [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-November/005168.html See this e-mail from Jimbo about the whole thing.]

I am trying.  I am active not only here on Wikibooks (giving you a perception that I'm ''in the center of power'' here) but I'm also active in other discussion forums where overall policy decisions are being made for the Wikimedia Foundation itself.  Keep in mind I'm just an ordinary editor/contributor such as yourself, but just a little more active.  I may have supporters as well, but I hope that is because I'm trying to fight for this project and I think it can be a very beneficial service to the world at large if it isn't messed up in the first place.  The only &quot;power&quot; I've been given is to be nominated and elected to become an administrator here on this project, which I've been very reluctant to use except in extreme circumstances.  I don't think Jimbo's view of vandalism and abuse are necessarily one of these extreme circumstances.

I see this whole mess also as a sign of growing pains, and in many ways a good thing.  In the beginning of this project it was largely the domain of just a few visionaries who wanted to write a few textbooks and have some fun doing something that couldn't be done on Wikipedia due to its book-like nature.  In the past few months, we have started to attract many individuals like yourself who have not been involved earlier with projects like Wikipedia, but are becoming involved with Wikibooks directly.  There has been some substantial growth in Wikibooks both in terms of content added and in terms of overall governance of what is going on here.  I welcome the whole debate over what this project should become, although it is interesting not only who is vocal about this whole issue, but also generally vocal individuals who have been noticably absent from the discussions here as well.

Please keep up your contributions you have done so far.  Generally speaking I don't see that any of them are in grave danger of being culled from this project, and in general I think Wikibooks will become a stronger project after this whole mess has been settled.  Thank you for being here on Wikibooks and helping turn this into a bright future for our children and grandchildren.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:41, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

:About where the &quot;real&quot; decision power here lies.  That is a big question, and in truth the Wikimedia projects are run with a loose sort of anarchy (as you seemed to have guessed so far).  A &quot;rough&quot; heirarchy can go something like this:

:*Anonymous Contributor
:*Registered User (you are one of these)
:*Administrator (about 40 currently on Wikibooks)
:*Bureaucrat (about 3 currently on Wikibooks)
:*Steward (none specific for Wikibooks, but some that cover all english-language Wikimedia projects and can act here if necessary)
:*Developer (the group that actually runs the equipment running all of these web servers)
:*Wikimedia Foundation Board

:Of these people, Jimmy Wales is the chairman of the Wikimedia Foundation Board, mainly by virtue of the fact that he help start this whole thing in the first place and wrote the checks to pay for the equipment when everything was first starting out.  It is now an official IRS 503(c) non-profit corporation with no stockholders and a charter to help run and do fundraising for all Wikimedia projects, of which Wikibooks is a part.  The board consists of five members, two of which are directly elected by users of the Wikimedia projects.  The last election was held in June of this year.  The intention is that eventually the whole board will eventually be directly elected by the users.  The equipment and maintainence budget is now financed directly through fundraising activities, mainly through direct solicitations of the users themselves.  Some groups like Google and Yahoo are providing some server support services as well, with a few minor donations like the Beck Foundation which help set up Wikijunior.

:Becoming a Steward, Bureaucrat, or Administrator is through direct election by ordinary users, and anybody who has proven themselves generally worthy to not make a mess out of everything and has the desire to help do the job can apply to become any of these positions.  Becoming a developer is not much harder, but it does require some technical knowledge of also being able to operate the equipment and to be able to write some of the computer software that is running this whole thing.  Generally the Developers stay out of the political process and only get involved when there are technical issues or somebody doing a direct attack on the computer systems.

:Technically, Jimmy Wales can shut down the whole of Wikibooks on a whim, but that would also alienate a huge number of volunteer editor/contributors such as yourself, and have reprocussions beyond just Wikibooks itself.  A major portion of the whole debate that is going on right now within Wikibooks is to determine just how much authority are we as a group going to give Mr. Wales directly in this regard to make policy.  There is some resistance to giving him any at all.  By being the CEO and chairman of the Wikimedia Foundation, his opinion does, however, have a lot of weight regardless.

:I hope this clears up the heirarchy idea here.  Generally speaking Mr. Wales has kept a &quot;hands off&quot; policy with most Wikimedia projects and letting the general community try to decide these issues.  I don't know what has caused this current ruckus, but sometimes people try to appeal decisions directly to the top and get his input even when it isn't strictly necessary on many issues.  I also think I inadvertantly ticked him off a few days ago when he came in under an assumed name and pushed his nose into the current set of policies where I thought he may have been out of line.  He has been known to do that from time to time so he can contribute without throwing his weight around like a ton of bricks.  Honestly I think it is a good idea in general, but he needs to be careful when he is speaking from an official capacity as the CEO, as he did recently to create all of this hubub.  If he had a problem with me personally, I wish he would have also dealt with me directly than taking it out on the whole project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:46, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

==Clarifications==

&quot;I also think I inadvertantly ticked him off a few days ago when he came in under an assumed name and pushed his nose into the current set of policies where I thought he may have been out of line.&quot;  No, I have never edited Wikibooks under any assumed name.

&quot;If he had a problem with me personally, I wish he would have also dealt with me directly than taking it out on the whole project.&quot; No, I have absolutely no problem with Rob, other than his getting very upset for reasons that I don't understand -- but I place the blame for that squarely on my own shoulders, not his.

Anyway, I'm easy to reach, you can leave a message on my user talk page either here or in english wikipedia, or you can email me.  jwales at wikia.com

&lt;/center&gt;

Over at [[Talk:Guide to UNIX/Linux]], from February 2005 to July 2005, there was a debate between the names &quot;Linux&quot; and &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;, which describe a computer &quot;kernel&quot; or &quot;operating system&quot;. Like &quot;weight&quot;, &quot;operating system&quot; is ambiguous; like &quot;pound&quot;, &quot;Linux&quot; might refer to two different but related things. There is also a Wikipedia article, [[w:GNU/Linux naming controversy]], about that dispute.

*'''Pound is force''': Now let me bring your attention to [[w:slug (mass)]]. Applying 1 pound of force to 1 slug accelerates it at 1 foot/s/s; this is similar to how applying 1 newton of force to 1 kilogram accelerates it at 1 meter/s/s. Thus in some contexts, &quot;pound&quot; is force and &quot;slug&quot; is mass. The book ''Physics for Scientists and Engineers, 5th edition, Volume 1'' (ISBN 0-7167-0809-4) describes the pound: ''The '''pound''' was originally defined as the weight of a particular standard object at a particular location. It is now defined as 4.448222 N.''

*'''Pound is mass''': In contrast, for the purposes of commerce in the United States, the definition written into the [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/uscode/ United States Code] is '''exactly''' 0.45359237 kilograms to 1 pound. (Search the code for &quot;pound kilogram&quot; and look at &quot;15USC Sec. 205. Authorized tables&quot;.) In fact, article 1, section 8, of the [[United States Government/The Annotated Constitution of the United States|US Constitution]] gives to Congress (the federal legislature) the authority to define measurement units in the United States.

*'''One-pound policy''': For the two definitions to be consistent, the acceleration due to gravity must be 4.448222/0.45359237 m/s/s which is about 9.80663 m/s/s, or almost the same as the &quot;standard value&quot; of 9.80665 m/s/s found at [[w:Gravity]]. The two definitions are not consistent because this Wikijunior module attempts to give weights on the moon and planets where the acceleration is much different from 9.8. Thus, one possible approach is to debate whether &quot;pound&quot; refers to mass or weight and adopt a one-pound policy which requires that a pound only be mass, or only be weight, but not both. This is as if all references to &quot;Linux&quot; in the module must be changed to &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;, or all &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; to &quot;Linux&quot;. With this approach, there is one correct kind of &quot;pound&quot; and one incorrect kind.

The problem with that version of the one-pound policy is that it requires the determination that one kind of pound is incorrect. I disagree that one kind of pound is incorrect. A pound is a unit of mass sometimes and a unit of force sometimes, just as a certain operating system is Linux sometimes and GNU/Linux sometimes. Thus I support this version of the one-pound policy: '''There is only one pound, but it has two definitions.''' I have wasted five paragraphs to make a trivial assertion about a naming problem. I oppose the idea that references to pound as mass, or pound as weight, must be corrected. See [[User:Kernigh/pound]] for details. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:28, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

==Language Character Sets and Fonts==

A different display font can be selected via the ''Display Font'' dialog. Open it via the ''Settings &gt; Display Font...'' menu item. The font type and size can be changed from the dialog.

Note that the font selected applies only to the user interface display (i.e. the ''Editor'' and ''Match and Glossary Viewer'' windows. It has no effect on the fonts used within any formatted documents. The fonts available for selection are those which are available on your system.

In order to permit translation between two languages which employ different alphabets, select a font which contains the character sets of both alphabets. Installation of additional fonts might be necessary in certain cases.

On Mac OS X, the operating system automatically selects a combination of fonts to represent the necessary characters. In some cases it is more effective to manually select the fonts to use.

If no single font contains the needed character sets, a virtual Java font (e.g. Serif) can be selected and defined in such a way that it uses multiple real fonts. Refer to the instructions available on the OmegaT website for customization and modification in this case.

==Editing Functions==

OmegaT's editing functions are only applicable to the target text of the active segment. This is the only text that may be edited at any one time. However, text in any segment outside the active one can be marked, copied, or pasted.

The usual mouse operations, cursor keys, cursor key shortcuts, and shortcuts (select, cut, and paste) are supported. These are likely to vary between operating systems though.

''Undo'' and ''Redo'' operations are possible with ''&lt;Ctrl-Z&gt;'' and ''&lt;Ctrl-Y&gt;'', respectively.

If there are fuzzy matches for the current segment it is possible to:

* insert the selected fuzzy match in the editor field with ''&lt;Ctrl-I&gt;''
* rewrite the whole field with the selected fuzzy match with ''&lt;Ctrl-R&gt;''

(refer to [[CAT-Tools/OmegaT/User_manual/Matches: Full and Fuzzy|Matches: Full and Fuzzy]] for details).

When working on a formatted file, the editor field will contain OmegaT specific tags that refer to the file's internal formatting structure.

It is not possible to add or change text formatting during translation. The formatting of the underlying structured file format, such as OpenDocument, OpenOffice.org, StarOffice, XHTML, or HTML (the only ones supported at present), is retained. Only a limited degree of control can be exercised over it (refer to [[CAT-Tools/OmegaT/User_manual/Tagged (Formatted) Files Text Editing|Tagged (Formatted) Files Text Editing]] for details).

One way to add formatting is to insert a marker in the text, where formatting is desired (using &quot;##&quot;, for instance) and then format the text in another application (e.g. OpenOffice.org) using the target documents that result from project compilation.

==What is Digital Cinema Distribution==
'''Digital Cinema Distribution''' is all about getting movies from the producers to the viewers using new digital technology instead of old celluloid technology.  It will involve watching movies projected by digital projectors (many find the term ''video'' having innapropriate connotations when discussing theatrical motion pictures) instead of from [[wikipedia:35mm film|35mm film]].

==Timescale==
The major Hollywood studios agreed a standard in mid 2005, and it is expected to become widespread during the following three-to-five years.  

==Image and Sound quality==
Images will be projected using either a 2k or 4k resoloution.  The digital picture will be free from dust and scratches, and movies originated digitally at high enough resolution (current examples being the [[wikipedia:Star Wars prequels|Star Wars prequels]] and 3D animations such as those made by [[wikipedia:Pixar|Pixar]]) will show no grain. 

Sound will change little from the digital surround found across the developed world, except that it will not be prone to the drop-out and pops common at reel changes.

==Business Implications==
Currently a large amount of the cost involved in getting a film to the cinema is the production and shipping of 35mm film prints.  This cost, along with the cost of promotion and marketing, is borne by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_distributor Distributor], and is known as the Prints and Advertising cost (P&amp;A).  With digital distribution all that is moved is a multi-gigabyte file (provided by the producer) containing picture and sound, so costs are dramatically reduced.  This cost reduction is the main reason the change will occur, since most cinema-goers seem satisfied with the current technology.

Furthermore, digital technology has been shown to consistently reduce in cost over a relatively short time compared with mechanical technology (i.e. celluloid projectors).  Consequently, it will become cheaper and easier to set up small cinemas over the coming years.

This has led to speculation that the nature of the business will change, including the probable flourishing of specialist exhibitors and small low-cost distributors.  Coming as it does in concert with the widespread availability of movie-making equipment and the associated surge in movie-making, there is likely to be a fragmentation of the market, with greater niche exhibition outlets.

==The Internet==
The fast transmission of files across the internet leads to great fears of piracy of digital movies, and no provision has been made in the standard for the transportation of the authored movie file.  Distributors will use whatever means necessary (including perhaps physical transportation of discs) to minimise piracy.

With greater bandwidth increases there is also the possibility of electronic distribtution of movies across the internet, which may threaten traditional theatrical exhibition. This is currently seen as a niche, but companies like [[wikipedia:Filmbay]] are already adressing this.

==Technical==
The current standard requires that a feature must be authored into a single file, much as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd_authoring DVD is].  This file will contain not only the picture and sound media, but also additional soundtracks for countries outside the producer's own.  When installed into a cinema's dedicated server, the exhibitor will ensure the correct combination of soundtrack and subtitles will be played for the audience.  The exhibitor may put on a showing for hearing-impaired cinemagoers and allow the subtitles for the hard of hearing to be displayed.  

A dedicated link to a central database allows the distributor to monitor how many times a film has been played, and with what soundtracks.  Metadata embedded in the stream allow for automated dimming of lights and drawing of curtains.

The standard allows back-and-forward compatibility with 2k and 4k picture resolutions, intending to allay the fears of cinema owners worring that buying the available 2k equipment will find themselves in need of a further upgrade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Some comments by Metric1000==

No standards agency maintains one definition of a pound for commerce and another for everything else.

Pounds are defined as units of mass exactly equal to 0.45359237 kg all around the world, since a 1959 agreement among the national standards agencies of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.  This definition has also officially been adopted in other places such as Ireland.

Of course, that redefinition made no change whatsoever in what '''quantity''' (as we use that term for weights and measures) is represented by a pound.  It already was a unit of mass.  In fact, in the United States, it had already been defined as a slightly different exact fraction of a kilogram for 66 years before that common, international agreement was put into use.

Slugs are a little used, 20th century invention, something that didn't appear in physics textbooks before 1940 and which have since disappeared from most of them, along with the rest of the English units.

So yes, pounds-force do also exist.  Before the 20th century, they were never well-defined units, though they had already been used in low-precision applications for a couple of centuries before then.  For example, in the boiler of a locomotive, it doesn't really matter much whether the actual accurate value of the gauge pressure is 450 of some well-defined unit, or 475 of some well-defined unit; using a pound-force based on whatever the force on a mass of one pound, under the influence of the local gravitational field, isn't going to matter in these low-precision applications.

Slugs, of course, did not exist when the United States first redefined the pound as an exact fraction of a kilogram.

What, exactly, is a '''poundal'''?  It is part of a coherent foot-pound-second system, the absolute fps system, which is older than the gravitational fps system including the slug.  The poundal dates back to 1879, at least.

I'll even tell you what it is, so you don't have to look it up (unless you don't understand me or don't believe me).  The poundal is a derived unit of ''force''.  It is the force which will accelerate the base unit of ''mass'' in that system at a rate of one foot per second squared.  Now your homework, a simple fill in the blank:

:The '''base unit of mass''' in this oldest fps system is the _______________.

&lt;small&gt;HINT:  It is the &quot;p&quot; in this &quot;fps&quot; system.&lt;/small&gt;

== ditch the units ==

This is silly. The use of unnecessary units is bad, even if we didn't have to deal with poundforce and such. Do like this:

'''People on Endor are pulled down with 1.23456 times as much force as they would be on Earth.'''

That's the number you need if you want to take your weight, in ''any'' system of units, and multiply it by something to get a feel for the difference. It works for any loose idea of stones, pounds, newtons, grams, slugs, etc.

If you decide to get all scientific, you can argue about units for ''acceleration'', not force. Acceleration of gravity on Earth is 20/7 rods/microfortnight/microfortnight.

== hard boiling potatoes ==

Are the terms ''hard boiling'' and ''mealy boiling'' used for potatoes in english? The terms don't show up much (in connection with potatoes) on google and I couldn't find a translation either. 

In German there are three distinctions [http://www.kartoffel.de/diekartoffel/sorten/body.htm]: 
* festkochend (hard boiling)
* vorwiegend festkochend (mostly hard boiling)
* mehligkochend (mealy boiling)

I use the term ''hard boiling'' on [[Cookbook:Cheddar_%28Vegan%29|Cheddar (Vegan)]] now, please correct if there is a better term. --[[User:Fasten|Fasten]] 09:43, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

== Roasting potatoes ==

Instead of parboiling, try microwaving the potatoes for a couple of minutes before roasting.

I prefer the result from this to parboiled.  What do others think?


== Excellent ==

Oh, goodness, finally someone who shares my view that a little humour can only add to the enjoyment of a recipe. Love that semi-german comment above... what was he on?? Not spuds, thats for sure!  And we thought american contributors take themselves so seriously. 

Lovely recipes here... I hope you dont mind that I have added a small section for a Rosti. If you dont like it, feel free to take it down.. its your page after all !! Peter (sorry, havent a clue how to add that automatically !!)

:G'day Peter, nobody [[WB:OWN|owns]] this article, except everybody. You own it as much as the original contributors own it. [[WB:BOLD|Be bold]]! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:05, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

== various issues with this page ==

Generally badly written &amp; poorly presented using cut/paste recipes without explanation of cooking methods/temperatures and a lot of personal preferences expressed

Amongst other issues  -
&quot;On a cold day, few things are nicer than a baked potato.&quot; - really? says who?
&quot;Preheat the oven to very hot (gas mark 7)&quot; - no electric temperatures etc
&quot;grated cheese (something strong like cheddar or red Leicester), &quot; really? define a &quot;strong cheese&quot;
&quot;Eat the skin — it really is good for you.&quot; Why?
&quot;It is important to protect the potatoes from drying by covering them with a damp paper towel or coating them in oil.&quot; No it's not! a damp paper towel will dry out in the microwave and probably stick to the starchy liquid that seeps from the potato during cooking!

&quot;Described here is the basic method. Put the potatoes in whole.&quot; Deep Fry potatoes whole?
&quot;If you don't have any day-old bread to hand, drop one of your chips in&quot; - why? use of bread to test oil temp isn't explained
&quot;Add the chips, using a frying basket.&quot; - hang on a moment ago we were frying the potato whole!
&quot;Keep a fire blanket or damp towel nearby at all times.&quot; no explanation of why (&amp; that this is only a concern if using a stove top deep fat frying pan.

&quot;Now, add the potato mixture to DRY (yes, really) frying pan and spread out evenly.....N.B.: Traditionally, Roesti either have butter or fat mixed into the grated potato before frying, or are fried in fat or oil.&quot; unexplained contradiction - obviously cut/paste from a recipe but without explanation this makes little sense
 
&quot;Stewing is a great way to take care of left over potatoes.&quot; is it? who says?
&quot;Potato stew goes well with sausages, meatballs, or smoked, salted or gravad fish.&quot; does it? 
[[Special:Contributions/81.179.30.155|81.179.30.155]] ([[User talk:81.179.30.155|discuss]]) 22:57, 19 July 2011 (UTC)

== glycoalkaloids ==
As of this writing, the article says: &quot;''If potatoes are exposed to light, they will develop green areas or start to sprout. These areas should be trimmed before using. Sprouts and green parts can be very poisonous, as they contain glycoalkaloids, solanine and chaconine. Although the green colour is caused by chlorophyll and is harmless, it may indicate the formation of the glycoalkaloids, so one should discard any green parts of such potatoes.''&quot;

According to [http://books.google.com/books?id=Xf5Q4jo_mEEC&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Resilient Gardner] glycoalkaloids are independent of the green color, the book claims that once a potato has developed green skin, it is no longer acceptable for animal feed use, and cannot be saved by peeling or trimming techniques.  Thus, the excerpted paragraph from the article page may be incorrect, and may be giving advice that could result in the consumption of glycoalkaloids.

==Tagged (Formatted) Files Text Editing==
===Working with Tags===

OmegaT displays the in-line formatting information of supported formats (at present HTML, XHTML, OpenDocument, and OpenOffice.org/StarOffice) as tags. The tags that are visible in OmegaT are not the same as those used by the original format; OmegaT converts them internally, and converts them back at compilation when the target documents are created.

Care must be exercised with tags. If they are accidentally changed, the formatting of the final file may be corrupted. In the worst case scenario a file may not open altogether; this occurs with OpenOffice.org files in particular.

Although custom formatting cannot be performed from within OmegaT, it is possible to apply some degree of control over the existing format.
====OpenDocument and OpenOffice.org File Tag Manipulation====

OpenDocument and OpenOffice.org tags must be preserved as is. Tags are paired as opening ( &lt;f&gt;) and closing ( &lt;/f&gt;) tags with consecutive numbers, starting from 1, in each segment. These tags cannot be deleted, duplicated, or have their sequence changed. However, it is possible to:

* move tags to a different part of the segment; as long as they remain in the same order;
* cancel tags by placing them next to each other.

:For instance, if the tagged sentence

 This text is in &lt;f1&gt;italics&lt;/f2&gt;.

:is changed to

 This text is in &lt;f1&gt;&lt;/f2&gt;italics.

:the italic formatting is effectively removed.

====HTML/XHTML File Tag Manipulation====

In HTML or XHTML the beginning of formatting is marked by an opening tag of the form &lt;x&gt;, and the end of formatting by a corresponding closing tag &lt;/x&gt; (where x represents the characters of a particular tag element). These tags have matching numbers, starting from 0, in each segment. Essentially, any changes made to tags must be made to both tags of the same pair.

The following rules for tags are applicable:

* Deletion is permitted (e.g. to remove italics from

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics&lt;/x0&gt;

:simply delete the tags &lt;x0&gt; and &lt;/x0&gt;).

* Duplication is permitted (e.g. in

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics&lt;/x0&gt;, and so is &lt;x1&gt;this&lt;/x1&gt;

:the same formatting of &quot;italics&quot; is applied to &quot;this&quot;).

* Change of order is permitted (e.g.

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics&lt;/x0&gt;, this text is &lt;x1&gt; underlined&lt;/x1&gt;

:can be changed to

 This text is &lt;x1&gt;underlined&lt;/x1&gt;, this text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics&lt;/x0&gt;)

* Nesting is permitted (e.g.

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics&lt;/x0&gt;, this text is &lt;x1&gt;underlined&lt;/x1&gt;

:can be changed to

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics and &lt;x1&gt;this text is also underlined&lt;/x1&gt;&lt;/x0&gt;)

* Overlap is not permitted (tagging like this

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics, this text is also &lt;x1&gt;underlined&lt;/x0&gt;, this text is underlined but not in italics&lt;/x1&gt;

:is not allowed and will corrupt the file. Insertion of an opening tag followed by a second opening tag requires the closing tag of the second opening tag to come before the closing tag of the first.

===Tag Validation===

The validate tags function (''Tools &gt; Validate Tags'') detects changed tags (whether done deliberately or by accident), and indicates the affected segments. Use of this function will open a dialog with any suspected broken or bad tags in a document.

This function can be useful for tracking down bugs in a translated tagged text. This is often a problem in OpenDocument or OpenOffice.org files that will not open due to tag problems created in the process of translation. Fixing the tags and recreating the target documents again can often remedy the problem.

==File Filters==

A new addition starting with OmegaT version 1.4.5 is user configurable file (conversion) filters.

===Overview===

File filters are responsible for:

* reading a source document in from a file in a specific format (e.g. different filters exist for handling plaintext and OpenDocument/OpenOffice files);
* extracting translatable content from a file;
* writing the target document out to file (replacing translatable content with its translation in the process).

Since the filters are a new addition in this release there may still be unknown bugs, user interface quirks, and unclear procedure–hopefully this documentation will help clear up a few things in that respect. At present the user interface text for the file filters is only available in English. This is a limitation of the current version that will be remedied in a newer version of OmegaT.

Please use realistic settings when configuring filters or else unexpected results may occur. Read the instructions carefully and, if the results of manipulating the filters is not understood, stick with the default settings or work with a test project before using them on serious work. Ask questions on the OmegaT users group to get more help.

Take note that file filters can only be configured when there is no project open. To modify file handling for a particular project it must be done before the project is opened.

===Filter Dialogs===

The details for each of the dialogs and filter usage is given here.

====File Filters====

Access to this dialog is gained by selecting ''File Filters...'' from the ''Settings'' menu.

Within the dialog a table of the available file formats that can be handled is presented. The left column shows the available filter types. The right column shows a checkbox next to each filter type that indicates whether it is enabled (i.e. with a check mark) or not.

Currently available filter types are: text, XHTML, HTML, OpenDocument/OpenOffice.org, and Java Resource Bundles.

To edit a file filter from the types available highlight it and select the ''Edit...'' button to open the ''Edit File Filter'' configuration dialog for it.

To reset the file filters after changes have been made select the ''Defaults'' button. Select ''OK'' for the reset to defaults to take effect or ''Cancel'' to back out of the reset. Be sure that resetting the filters to defaults is what is wanted before accepting the changes.

====Edit File Filters====

Access this from the ''File Filters'' dialog via the ''Edit...'' button.

The user is presented here with a four column table for the file filter type selected. The table contains the headings: ''Source Filename Pattern, Source File Encoding, Target File Encoding,'' and ''Target Filename Pattern'' for the configured settings of a particular filter. These are used for the following purposes:

* Source Filename Pattern - determines which files in the '''/source''' directory will have the particular filter applied to them. Patterns can be customized according to the users' preferences.
* Source File Encoding - the character encoding in effect for the source files. Used to read in the source files. Has a drop down list from which to choose encodings.
* Target File Encoding - the character encoding in effect for the target files. Used to write out the target files. Has a drop down list from which to choose encodings.
* Target Filename Pattern - determines the pattern used to assign filenames to the target documents created in '''/target'''. Patterns can be customized according to the users' preferences.

On the right side of the dialog are the buttons ''Add...'', ''Edit...'', and ''Remove...'' that are used to open the ''Add Filter, Edit Filter,'' and ''Remove Filter'' dialogs, respectively

There is another ''Defaults'' button available in this dialog also. Use of this button will reset the filters for the filter type back to its original number of filters and default settings. Again, be sure this is exactly what is wanted before using it.

===Add Filter &amp; Edit Filter===

Access these from the ''Edit File Filters'' dialog via the ''Add...'' and ''Edit...'' buttons, respectively.

These dialogs and their instructions are the same, but their use is slightly different. User defined filters are created in the ''Add Filter'' dialog. A newly created filter is added to the list of available filters for the particular type of filter through this dialog. Default and user defined filters are edited in the ''Edit Filter'' dialog. A chosen filter is updated when changes are accepted there.

Each dialog contains a number of entries that must be filled in to properly configure the settings of a filter. These correspond to the settings seen in the ''Edit File Filters'' dialog. Select ''OK'' to add a new filter or accept changes to an existing filter, or ''Cancel'' to back out of the particular operation.

====Source Filename Pattern====

Specify the pattern used to the determine which files in the /source directory will have the particular filter applied to them. Patterns can be customized according to the users' preferences and within the limits of normal shell (glob) patterns.

Enter the appropriate source file pattern in the text area. There is a default pattern set here which depends on the particular filter under consideration. Use the default or set a custom one according to the specific source files that are to be used with the filter.
Source File Encoding

Specify the source file character encoding. This can be determined externally and entered (e.g. known ahead of time, from OpenOffice.org, etc.), by the file extension for some preset file formats (i.e. plaintext in Latin-1 uses *.txt1. or, if applicable, the &lt;auto&gt; setting can be used. For some formats the ability to change the encoding will be disabled. See the Encodings section on this page for details on the &lt;auto&gt; and disabled settings.

Select the appropriate encoding from the drop down list, or use &lt;auto&gt; for a filter to be automatically selected to read source files in with.
Target File Encoding

Specify the target file character encoding. The target documents will be created with the selected encoding. It may be a good idea to know the encoding required ahead of time for the particular target locale. If applicable, the &lt;auto&gt; setting can be used to attempt to automatically set the encoding. Again, for some formats the ability to change the encoding will be disabled. See the Encodings section on this page for details on the &lt;auto&gt; and disabled settings.
Target Filename Pattern

Specify the pattern used to assign filenames to the target documents created in /target. Patterns can be customized according to the users' preferences, within the limits of normal shell (glob) patterns.

Enter the appropriate target file pattern in the text area. The default pattern set here depends on the particular filter under consideration. Use the default or set up a custom pattern to alter the filenames of the target files for this filter. There are a number of preset filename variables available for this purpose.
Filename Variables

For the Target Filename Pattern there are few preset filename variables that can be used to help create the filenames of the target documents. The syntax of these variables is ${VARIABLE} and follows from commonly known glob patterns in shell (command line) usage. A variable is used in line in the Target Filename Pattern text area to insert the filename variables' values that are determined from the files and settings in a project.

Select a filename variable from the drop down list. Use the Insert button to put a selected variable at the cursor location in the Target Filename Pattern text area.
Filename Variables Variable	Description
${filename}	filename of a source file (name and extension)
${nameOnly}	source file name only, without the extension
${extension}	source file extension only
${sourceLanguage}	project's source language (locale) (xx-YY or xx_YY)
${targetLocale}	project's target locale (xx_YY)
${targetLanguage}	project's target language (xx-YY)
${targetLanguageCode}	project's target language code (xx)
${targetCountryCode}	project's target country code (YY)

${filename} is the default configuration for the Target Filename Pattern in most cases, which means that the source file name and target (translated) file names will be the same.

See Sample Project for information on language (locale) and codes.
Remove Filter

This is a confirmation dialog only. Select OK to permanently remove a filter. User defined filters will not be available after confirming their removal. The default filters for a particular file format will also not be available if removed, but these can be restored from the Edit File Filters dialog by selecting Defaults.
Encodings

Encodings for source and target are selectable from the drop down lists in the Edit File Filters, Add Filter, and Edit Filter dialogs. The encodings available are limited to those in the Java Runtime Environment in operation. In addition, an &lt;auto&gt; variable can be used to attempt to automatically detect the source file encoding required.
&lt;auto&gt; Setting

Depending upon the particular filter in use, one of three actions will be taken when an &lt;auto&gt; setting is encountered:

   1. OmegaT will attempt to determine the encoding automatically; applies to source files only.
   2. the default encoding of the operating system will be used.
   3. no action will occur. This happens when the filter only supports a single source and target encoding.

Disabled(Grayed Out) Setting

The particular filter with the disabled variable does not support multiple file encodings or the file format is encoding-neutral. In which case there is no way to specify another encoding.
Example: Target Filename Pattern

Perhaps it would be nice to change the target filenames to reflect the particular target language or locale being translated to. One possibility is to add a suffix to the file names (before the extension). For instance, if the target language is French, then the addition of the language code might be good.

In this case the pattern could be

${nameOnly}-fr.${extension},

but there is already a variable for the target language code so insert that variable instead to give

${nameOnly}-${targetLanguageCode}.${extension}.

Now, if a source file was named test.txt. (e.g. under the *.txt. text filter) the target filename for it would become test-fr.txt.

Note that the filename separator '.'. is not inserted by using ${extension}, it must be manually included in the pattern if you want it.

Continuing, perhaps the country code would be nice also. It could be added with

${nameOnly}-${targetLanguageCode}-CA.${extension}

for the case of French as the target language and Canada as the country. In this case test.txt. would become test-fr-CA.txt.

In this case, there is already a variable for the target country code available so insert that variable to give

${nameOnly}-${targetLanguageCode}-${targetCountryCode}.${extension}

Much more simply for the case at hand, just insert the target language in place of the target language code and target country code filename variables.

${nameOnly}-${targetLanguage}.${extension}

The result is the same in the last two cases as before. In this example the target filename now has the language (language plus country code) tacked on as a suffix to all of the files names before the extension, the extension is unaltered.
Questions &amp; Answers
How is the filter that works with a file determined?

This is determined by a file's pattern. Each filter lists the source file pattern of the files it can handle. This can be set by adding or editing a file filter. Each filter may have a distinct pattern associated with it. For example, if the plaintext filter is to be used to handle all files without an extension, add or edit a filter to have a *.. source filename pattern. There are also a few preset filters that work with a specific file type, but use different encodings. For example, a Latin-1 encoded plaintext file can be recognized by the .txt1 extension. All files can be given a particular pattern ahead of using them in a project so they will automatically be recognized. In the example, the extension was the determining factor for associating files with a filter.
What if a file encoding seems incorrect?

Set up another encoding instead by changing the Source File Encoding of the appropriate file filter.
What can be done if a single encoding does not work well for the source and target languages?

In reality, UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 encodings will work in almost all cases. It is possible to use one of these encodings for source and target together. To use two different encodings for source and target ensure that the appropriate encodings are chosen for each character set and that the source document files are saved in the proper encoding before opening the project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have been interested in hearing from people who want to make a vast improvement to the stock exchange component along with serious modification to monopoly as well... 

While Parker Brothers put this Stock Exchange c. 1936 add on to MONOPOLY c. 1935 Their basic change does very little to the game ... excpt use for collateral or collect dividends... and the CHESSEX version did allow for more options and minor conditions in the Stock Exchange Market, my ideas are worth quite a few serious changes in the game.  

For starts:

You can buy a house or a property at the mortgaged price just like you do today. 

Each time you pass go you collect your go salary less 10 % of your morgaged properties because You rent out part of that to a renter and pay part of the interest on the mortgage ... the bank gets that rent as interest only on the mortgaged property. To pay the Mortgage you must pay it off in full plus 10 % interest.   

Instead of just buying your property at face value when you land on it you can do 4 things now:

a] Buy the property at its mortgaged value 

b] pay the bank the rent it says on the title deed *

 * this idea was in the Landlord game copyright 1904 ... 

c] buy the property at full value 

d] auction it off and if you don't buy the property the you pay the rent to the winner of the auction... if nobody buys the property you must pay double rent to the bank. This is because the bank acted as your agent at the auction to sell the new property and the bank ain't free

If you land on someone's mortgaged property should not exempt the lander from paying the rent like Parker Brothers rules say it should ... Here the Bank collects the rent as &quot;interest on the Amortized mortgage as it would in real life.&quot; 

Taking Boardwalk as the example you can:
  
a] buy property at $200 [$200 mortgage]
b] Pay $50 rent for landing there to the bank 
c] Pay $ 400 full price to the bank
d] hold an auction to buy it at whoever wishes to get it ... if you are the highest bidder just pay the highest bid to the Bank. If you are not, you pay $50 rent to the winner of the auction. If nobody buys it after an auction was declared, you pay $100 rent. [PS who would not jump at buying Boardwalk for $1 but there are properties that people might not buy at all on any auction.

Instead of having just the stock exchange selling stocks and paying dividends .. I propose a few chaanges .. 

a] buy a single stock any time on your turn at list value plus a broker's fee of 10 %... or for List price plus $1 broker's fee on stock exchange for all transactions 

b] usng your photocopy of the set from Hasbro of the stock exchange parts photocopy the shares and change the values to make the stocks go from $10 to $200  a share in increments of $10 print out a minimum of 15 copies of these shares ...

Make some market change cards that affect the whole market [GO salary, Shares, stock market and real estate market 2 areas in real estate title deeds and house/hotel fluctuations ... ranging from -10 to + 10 range level 
  
the 0 level is the original starting point of the entire market 

make a scaled market value sheet affecting every one 

Make dividend sheet for all 20 different stock certificates ...  

Stock levels go from 0 x [hand in stocks and reset the market level to normal] to Double value [Hand in get a split 2 for 1 on every stock you own 
title deed prices are also fluctuating at different rates ..

You can add a bank foreclosure give up a property 
or a house  to chance /comunity chest 

A bankrupt card ... hand all in and start over and even if you own almost all the property. Yes Mary,  millionaires do go broke in poor investments. 

It cost you low rates or high damage claims on you 

...you will be changing stocks frequently when you own these stocks will change so you need to have the incremented stocks .... 
Bull market ... all prices go up one level   
Bear Marker .. all prices go down 1 level 
High inflation market prices jump up three levels
Recession cause the market to go down 3 level 
 
Each level is calculated at a differnt percentage from normal or starting point ... houses and title deeds are thus fluctuating as well..   

What interesting is that some of these cards in chance and community chest affect all the people on the board....  Builders do go ON strike so you can't build until all PLAYERS PASS GO.

AND STOCK EXCHANGE ALLOWS FREE PARKING ONLY IF YOU DO BUSINESS WITH THE MARKET ... IT'S NOW METERED PARKING IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ON THAT SQUARE YOU HAVE SOME THINGS YOU CAN DO ... OR BUY A STOCK FOR $11 DOLLAR [$ 1 BROKER FEE] PAY A $15 PARKING FEE, ROLL THE DICE AND TAKE SOME CHANCES ... INCLUDING A TRIP TO THE CITY JAIL OR PAYING DOUBLE RENT FOR DAMAGING SOMEONE'S HOTEL.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Weight vs. Mass Wikijunior article ==

While I would agree that Metric1000 is perhaps going over the top and not seeking ways to compromise, you do need to pay attention to the arguments he is making.  There is some sound science regarding what he is trying to suggest.  He doesn't seem to complain too much about the &quot;effects of Gravity&quot; section I wrote, and certainly can't change the numbers in any way to reflect any differences in what it is saying from the mass vs. weight argument.  In fact, it bypasses the argument altogether, which is why I've tried to go that route.

In short, give up trying to revert his changes when you try to say that you &quot;weigh&quot; 5 kg on the Moon if you weigh 30 kg on the Earth.  Technically it isn't accurate anyway, which is precisely what he is trying to say.  The question I'm trying to raise (and have tried to raise) is what kinds of experiences would be different if you were inside a large enclosed pressurized space (with the volume of an indoor athletic arena... certainly a possibility in the future).

I have suggested that Quiddich would become a very real sport on the Moon, due to the fact that human powered flight would be possible.  I have no doubt that some enterprising soul would even come up with a contraption like the &quot;golden snitch&quot; that has some sort of interesting AI built into it as well.  It would also be an athletic competition that would be encouraged by residents on the Moon to keep their bodies toned up to avoid muscular atrophy from not fighting the constant 9.8 m/s^2 gravity that is on the Earth.  BTW, this isn't a new concept.  In fact, Robert Heinlein came up with the concept in his novel &quot;The Menace from Earth&quot; that talks about sport flight on the moon in some large volcanic chambers that were pressure sealed on the Moon.

What other cool things would be possible due to a change in gravity and how would life be different?  &quot;Weighing&quot; less is but one aspect that can be covered.  I'm sure we can come up with some other cool ideas as well.  Can we come up with some other lunar games and sports that would be impossible on the Earth?  Burt Rutan (the guy that build Scaled Composites' Space Ship One that won the X-Prize) suggested with a low enough gravity that you could &quot;walk&quot; on water due to surface tension, and at least be swimming much faster due to less of your body being submersed inside the water.  Mr. Rutan wants to experience that first hand with a space station containing a reduced  g swimming pool and even showed the plans for it to Mike Wallace on the CBS television show 60 Minutes.

Let's be creative here and not get bogged down into a petty edit fight.  We can be better than Metric1000 in that aspect because all that contributor has accomplished is to get people like you pissed at him.  IMHO, lets just get rid of the weight vs. mass section completely.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:18, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

: ''Thanks for your response, Rob. I tried to acknowledge Metric1000's point about usage, history and law in more than one of my replies on the talk page, but this seems not to've worked - or, at least, I did not do this sufficiently strongly. Given the manner of his posts, however, I decided especially calm and circumspect reponses were needed.

: ''In the module itself, I hope I only removed his preaching that there's no difference between 'mass' and 'weight' rather than engage in reversion. If it appears to be outright reversion I apologise and take note. As regards my contributions not being technically accurate, I am aware of this but at the same am aware this is meant to be a module in a book for children. I just wanted to point out that science has distinct uses for the terms 'mass' and 'weight' and that their weight according to a bathroom scale would change from planet to planet or the like. I'd say that as most of us aren't practising scientists we don't use the word 'mass' that much in our everyday life on Earth, so all the more reason to confirm that what we think of here on Earth as 'weight' changes if we're on other planets etc or moving in certain ways, such as the example of orbiting. I don't believe being comprehensive or especially accurate matters here; just making the point that something - 'weight' - changes.

: ''This is why I'd like to propose your approach as a solution. Yes, perhaps I may've been more creative in my attempts to point out to Metric1000 that changes in weight occur from place to place in the universe. I certainly hope, however, that I haven't been engaged in - and, most of all, haven't appeared willing or happy to engage in - an edit fight.

: ''Thanks again for your involvement,&lt;/br&gt;

Since you removed the &quot;this module is finished&quot; noticed, the module is getting &quot;unfinished&quot;.  Words are getting added.  The reading level is going up.  I am almost convinced that it is absolutely impossible to get an entire book ready for publication at the same time.

Do you  have any ideas on how to get a module proofread and then held static?

Thanks for your thoughts

--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 02:01, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

: ''I'd suggest something along the lines of the following. Have an administrator announce that a module is to undergo a final period of copyediting and proofreading, leading to a vote to protect that version of the module from further editing. All those wishing to take part in the vote have N days in which to register their interest. After that, once those who have registered to vote reach a consensus that the module is ready, the supervising administrator protects that version of the module and anyone else who has come along since (or who didn't register their interest, etc) will be editing what will/might become the next version of the module. Once this has occurred for all modules, you have a first (second, third, etc) version of the Wikibook for printing.

: ''As regards my intervention in the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System|Our Solar System]] module, this arose because I have begun to work my way through the Wikijunior Solar System modules removing the adult-style superscripted reference numbers, URLs, etc from the text and replacing them with quotes from the text linked to the references in each module's separate References section. While beginning to do this for [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System|Our Solar System]] I felt there were some fundamental steps missing from the story outlined at the start of the module. If my attempt to insert them has created too demanding a text, I apologise and believe it should be possible to resimplify the text without losing them.

: ''I ''am'' convinced that is impossible to declare an entire Wikibook &amp;ndash; even a Wikijunior book &amp;ndash; ready for publication unless something in the spirit of the above is agreed. Otherwise, yes, &quot;Maybe a wiki is a lousy place to write a book&quot;.

=== proofreading [[Wikijunior Solar System]]===
Are you familiar with the process of rounding up admins, getting them to do stuff, etc?  I'm not.  If you want to propose a change in the finished project of the proofreading process, why not go ahead and do that.  Follow your own approach.  Do &quot;we&quot; agree on taking the references out right now?  How about on how to do that?  The nice thing about having them where they are is that they show which facts have been checked.

--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 01:16, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

: ''A vote was started sometime ago [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System#References.|here]] on how to treat referencing and as there has been no votes or comments against keeping them away from the text, I have forged onward. I believe young people prefer reading texts without superscripts or the like (see [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System#Footnotes|here]]). I'm aware that the format I'm implementing is less specific, but so far I feel it is still sufficiently specific to indicate the source/s of nearly each and every fact. Since most of the references I've parsed thus far refer to the same four or so sources per modules, I'm tempted to plan a second pass through them to remove such redundancy. I would however propose such an idea first.

: ''I am more concerned that my efforts to copyedit (not proofread) the modules may result in sentences etc that are too demanding for our target audience. I would very much appreciate your (and anyone else) pointing out when you feel that has happened &amp;ndash; or, probably better, simply rephrasing it. Back on the [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System#Any target audience trials?|Wikijunior Solar System talk page]] (and perhaps elsewhere) I've enquired whether anyone has easy contact with a bunch of 7-12 year olds so we can benefit from some feedback. Elsewhere someone has mentioned they received a positive response from a (or maybe a few) young person/people but I'd like to feel reassured about the assumptions modules already make about young people's grasp of numbers, scale, history, etc, etc before I unwittingly add any more.

: ''Meanwhile, I'm not familiar with the process of rounding up admins etc but if (or probably when) push comes to shove I'd sort out what to do and put what we've been discussing before them.

==Freezing modules==
I would agree that we need to freeze the modules at some point; IPs especially will keep adding to or changing the contents. I know there's a few admins who have worked on Wikijunior, so it should't be too much trouble getting them to lock the modules.

== Hello ==

We've never talked, but im &quot;Basejumper123&quot; from &quot;comets&quot; in &quot;the solar system&quot; and im trying to polish off the page and you seemed interested in the proofreading process, but im not sure you finished, if you've got time please try come to this link and help us out!

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:21, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

*[[W:ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]], ''Standard for Metric Practice,'' E 380-79, ASTM 1979.
**     '''3.4.1.2''' Considerable confusion exists in the use of the term weight as a quantity to mean either force or mass.  In commercial and everyday use, the term weight nearly always means mass; thus, when one speaks of a person's weight, the quantity referred to is mass. . . .  Because of the dual use of the term weight as a quantity, this term should be avoided in technical practice except under circumstances in which its meaning is completely clear.  When the term is used, it is important to know whether mass or force is intended and to use SI units properly as described in 3.4.1.1, by using kilograms for mass or newtons for force.
**     '''3.4.1.3''' Gravity is involved in determining mass with a balance or scale.  When a standard mass is used to balance the measured mass, the effects of gravity on the two masses are equalized, but the effects of the buoyancy of air or other fluid on the two masses are generally not equalized.  When a spring scale is used, the scale reading is directly related to the force of gravity.  Spring scales graduated in mass units may be properly used if both the variation in acceleration of gravity and the buoyancy corrections are not significant in their use.
**     '''3.4.1.4''' The use of the same name for units of force and mass causes confusion.  When the non-SI units are used, a distinction should be made between force and mass, for example, lbf to denote force in gravimetric engineering units and lb for mass.

==== NIST ====
*[[w:NIST|U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology]], Dr. Barry N. Taylor, ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units,'' NIST Special Publication 811, [http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec08.html#8.3]
** Thus the SI unit of the quantity weight used in this sense is the kilogram (kg) and the verb &quot;to weigh&quot; means &quot;to determine the mass of&quot; or &quot;to have a mass of&quot;.
** Examples:  the child's weight is 23 kg
::::the briefcase weighs 6 kg 
::::Net wt. 227 g
* [Note that the same section also defines weight in a different meaning from this one which is proper for body weight; in that other meaning, &quot;Thus the SI unit of the quantity weight defined in this way is the newton (N).&quot;  This section also concludes with the excellent advice, &quot;In any case, in order to avoid confusion, whenever the word &quot;weight&quot; is used, it should be made clear which meaning is intended.&quot;]

*The National Standard of Canada, CAN/CSA-Z234.1-89 ''Canadian Metric Practice Guide,'' January 1989:
**'''5.7.3'''  Considerable confusion exists in the use of the term &quot;weight.&quot; In commercial and everyday use, the term &quot;weight&quot; nearly always means mass.  In science and technology, &quot;weight&quot; has primarily meant a force due to gravity.  In scientific and technical work, the term &quot;weight&quot; should be replaced by the term &quot;mass&quot; or &quot;force,&quot; depending on the application.
**'''5.7.4'''  The use of the verb &quot;to weigh&quot; meaning &quot;to determine the mass of,&quot; e.g., &quot;I weighed this object and determined its mass to be 5 kg,&quot; is correct.
:[An interesting thing to note here is a significant difference in usage of the noun forms and the verb forms.]

==== SAE ====
*[[W:Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] TSB003, ''Rules for SAE use of SI (Metric) Units,'' May 1999:
**'''7.4.2''' Considerable confusion exists in the use of the term weight as a quantity to mean either force or mass. In commercial and everyday use, the term weight nearly always means mass; thus, when one speaks of a person's weight, the quantity referred to is mass. This nontechnical use of the term weight in everyday life will probably persist. In science and technology, the term weight of a body usually meant the force that, if applied to the body, would give it an acceleration equal to the local acceleration of free fall. The adjective &quot;local&quot; in the phrase &quot;local acceleration of free fall&quot; usually meant a location on the surface of the earth. In this context, the &quot;local acceleration of free fall&quot; has the symbol g (commonly referred to as &quot;acceleration of gravity&quot;). Values of g differing by over 0.57 at various points on the earth's surface have been observed.2 In a technical context, the use of force of gravity (mass times acceleration of gravity), instead of weight with this meaning is recommended. Because the term weight is ambiguous, care should be taken to assure that the intended meaning is clear.

:: Am I reading this correctly that values of &quot;g&quot; (or average acceleration due to gravity on Earth at 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being the usual figure) varies by 0.57?  Is that 0.57 &quot;g's&quot;, or 0.57 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 0.57%?  I can see some altitude variations (Mt. Everest vs. Dead Sea) or lattitude (polar vs. equitorial gravity effects).  Measuring the local gravity field was an experiment I did in High School physics class, BTW.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:12, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

::: I'm sure that 0.57% was intended, though the pdf file only has the quoted &quot;0.57&quot;.  Actually, the normal gravity '''at sea level''' increases by more than 0.53% from the equator to the poles (9.7803267715 m/s² to 9.8321863685 m/s²), and with local anomalies from those normal values it is possible that the actual measured values at sea level could vary by 0.57%.  The average at sea level (Geodetic Reference System 1980) is 9.797644656 m/s².[http://www.gfy.ku.dk/~iag/handbook/geodeti.htm] Throw in Mt. Chimborazo, the highest mountain on Earth in both ways relevant to this discussion, and the variation on the surface of the Earth, from there to the North Pole is more than 0.7%.  
::: With that Everest and Dead Sea stuff, you remind me of the fools at Aviation Now, who tried to make a point by comparing the force of gravity on an elephant at the Denver Zoo and at the San Diego Zoo.  In addition to much confusion about kilograms as units of force and using conversion factors too imprecise for their measurements and the like, they also failed to figure out the most important factor: that the acceleration of gravity at the San Diego Zoo is actually '''less''' than it is at the Denver Zoo, not the other way around.  Latitude is a more important factor than altitude is.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:40, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

*[[W:National Physical Laboratory|NPL]] FAQ [http://www.npl.co.uk/force/faqs/forcemassdiffs.html]
*Weight
:In the trading of goods, weight is taken to mean the same as mass, and is measured in kilograms. Scientifically however, it is normal to state that the weight of a body is the gravitational force acting on it and hence it should be measured in newtons, and this force depends on the local acceleration due to gravity. To add to the confusion, a weight (or weightpiece) is a calibrated mass normally made from a dense metal, and weighing is generally defined as a process for determining the mass of an object.

:So, unfortunately, weight has three meanings and care should always be taken to appreciate which one is meant in a particular context.

**In commercial and everyday use, and in many technical fields, the term &quot;weiqht&quot; is usually used as a synonym for mass. This is how 'weight&quot; is used in most United States laws and regulations. See the note at 5.2.1 for further explanation. 
**... [note at 5.2.1]
**NOTE: There is ambiguity in the use of the term weight to mean either force or mass. In general usage, the term weighr nearly always means mass and this is the meaning given the term in U.S. laws and regulations.   Where the term is so used, weight is expressed in kilograms in SI. In many fields of science and technology the term weight is defined as the force of gravity acting on an object, i.e., as the product of the mass of the object and the local acceleration of gravity. Where weight is so defined, it is expressed in newtons in SI.

==== American National Metric Council ====
*American National Metric Council, &quot;Metric Editorial Guide,&quot; 3d ed. 1978
**'''7.1'''  In commercial and everyday use, the term &quot;weight&quot; nearly always means mass; the use of the word &quot;weight&quot; to mean &quot;mass&quot; and the word &quot;weigh&quot; to mean &quot;determine the mass of&quot; or &quot;have a mass of&quot; is acceptable.
::Examples:  My weight is 60 kilograms.
::::Weigh the envelope carefully.
::::The suitcase weighs 12 kilograms.
**'''7.2'''  Since the word &quot;weight is used to mean both mass and force, its use should be avoided in science and technology except under circumstances in which its meaning is completely clear.  In SI, mass is measured in kilograms, and force is measured in newtons.

==== International definition of a pound ====
*Here is the current '''official definition of a pound''' in the United States (and as you can see from the quote, in the rest of the world as well), and these are the pounds we use when we weigh ourselves &quot;at the doctor's office&quot;.  Federal Register Notice of July 1, 1959: [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf]
**''Announcement.'' Effective July 1, 1959, all calibrations in the U.S. customary system of weights and measures carried out by the National Bureau of Standards will continue to be based upon metric measurement standards and, except those for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey as noted below, will be made in terms of the following exact equivalents and appropriate multiples and submultiples:

::&lt;center&gt;1 yard= 0.914 4 meter&lt;/center&gt;

::&lt;center&gt;1 pound (avoirdupois)= 0.453 592 37 kilogram&lt;/center&gt;

::Currently, the units defined by these same equivalents, which have been designated as the International Yard and the International Pound, respectively, will be used by the National Standards Laboratories of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and United Kingdom; thus there will be brought about international accord on the yard and pound by the English-speaking nations of the world, in precise measurements involving these basic units.

== General discussion ==

=== Teachers who mislead students by ===

====&quot;Measure your weight in newtons&quot;====

There are too many teachers who, being confused about how we do this in the real world, and how we should do it, confuse their students by telling them that they should routinely measure their weight in newtons.

They should not do so.  The kilograms used throughout the world, including most hospitals in the United States, are the proper SI units for this weight.  Note, of course, that there are no kilograms-force in SI.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:24, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

====&quot;Pounds are not units of mass&quot;====

There are hundreds of web sites, and even a few textbooks for introductory college science classes, and perhaps for junior high school or high school as well, which falsely claim that pounds are not units of mass. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:24, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== &quot;If you weighed 100 units...&quot; ===

Many teachers don't have any big problem understanding that as measurements of mass, kilograms do not vary no matter where you are (the situation is different with pounds, because few people really understand the old English units)

Note that the verb &quot;to weigh&quot; (as noted in the excerpts from the Canadian Standard for Metric Practice and the ANMC Guide above) is used to mean &quot;to measure the mass of&quot; or &quot;to have a mass of&quot; even many by those people who cannot bring themselves to use the historically, linguistically, and legally correct noun &quot;weight&quot; for the result of that measurement..  

If you want people to give up their rightful, prior claim to the word &quot;weight&quot;, then you had damn sure better give them a verb to use as well as a noun.  The use of &quot;to mass&quot; with the meaning above remains substandard usage which grates on the ears of most people, including most physicists and chemists and the like.  That's why they continue to use &quot;to weigh&quot; with that meaning, even if they switch words for the noun usage.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:24, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:This is an astronomy book, so we should use words primary in ways the astronomers themselves use them and then explain how it is different from everyday use and from the commerical and legal definitons. --[[User:StarryTG|StarryTG]] 06:54, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::About the only way astronomers ever use &quot;weight&quot; is in the way it was used in Cavendish's famous paper, &quot;Weighing the Earth&quot;.  Plus the occasional stepping outside their field to mangle up the proper medical sciences meaning of the word weight, as we've seen here.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 09:15, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Additions by StarryTG ==

I left much of the additions by [[User:StarryTG|StarryTG]] dealing with mass and gravity, but took out the two paragraphs in the &quot;What is weight?&quot; section.  Here is what was written, and why it was inappropriate.

=== One of several meanings ===

 Weight is the amount of gravitional force there is on an object with
 mass. The gravitional force could be from anything else with mass,
 such as a planet or moon. A given gravitional field would pull down
 on a more massive object with a larger force than a less massive object.

This is indeed one definition of the ambiguous word weight (but not quite a complete definition, because there are variations in the precise usage depending on factors such as rotation and buoyancy).  However, it is not the definition of weight which is proper &quot;in the doctor's office&quot; for our body weight.

Remember, we are building on what the students know.  This is not the &quot;weight&quot; they are most familiar with.  They see the &quot;net weight&quot; listed on billions of items in our grocery stores and haredware stores and car parts stores.  They see the 63 kg weight classes in Olympic boxing or wrestling or judo or whatever.  They calculate their body mass index&amp;mdash;the smarter ones doing it from height in meters and weight in kilograms, so they don't have to remember complicated conversion factors not useful in any other context. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 23:50, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== Misstating the reasons ===

 Many people use the word weight to mean the same thing as mass. This
 works on Earth because the strength of gravity is about the same all
 over the world. However, we will see that the difference between weight
 and mass becomes noticable when we consider other planets.

We use the word &quot;weight&quot; with that meaning, because we've been doing so for over 1000 years.  This word entered Old English over 1000 years ago, meaning the quantity measured with a balance.  That quantity is mass, not force.

A thousand years ago, English-speakers used this weight as a measure of how much stuff they had, for the purpose of trade.  We still measure the very same quantity for the very same purposes today, and we still quite properly and legitimately call it &quot;weight&quot;.

A bag of sugar with a &quot;net weight&quot; of 2 kg would still have a net weight of 2 kg on Pluto.  A man with a weight of 175 lb would still have a weight of 175 lb on Mars, using the normal and proper meaning used in the medical sciences and in sports, the primary reasons we weigh ourselves. 

Yes, the change in the force due to gravity, and the unchanging mass, are both noticeable.  It is still as hard to throw a baseball on Mars at the same speed you'd throw it on Earth; it will take gravity a while longer to pull it to the ground, however. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 23:50, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

===After we got so &quot;smart&quot; we still measure the same thing ===

You might have some argument if, after we got to be so smart, we changed the quantity we measured for these purposes.  But that simply did not happen.

It doesn't '''work ... because the strength of gravity is about the same.'''  We simply aren't interested in how hard that pound of butter, or that 400 troy ounce bar of gold, is pressing down on our table.  We want that measurement to be the same no matter what the strength of the local gravitational field.  That's the way we use it; that's the way we've always done it.

We'd use the same units of measurement for that butter or that gold on the Moon or Mars as we do on Earth.  '''We'd still calibrate our scales on the Moon or on Mars the very same way that we do on Earth&amp;mdash;'''for the accurate measurement of mass in the very location in which they are used.  Just stop for a minute and think about the way those scales are tested and certified in the supermarket under government supervision, or in hospitals where the government isn't so concerned about it but the doctors are, because they want the numbers from a different ward in their hospital, or from a different hospital, to be comparable&amp;mdash;it is done the same way in either place.

In other words, we don't want to measure force, and we don't particularly care if some fools in their own jargon want to use our word &quot;weight&quot; with a different meaning for their own purposes.  Fortunately, however, nobody was ever damn fool enough to give any physics teacher any say-so in what the term &quot;net weight&quot; means in commerce, a term which never refers to a force (it is not a physics term).  Nor do &quot;troy weight&quot; and many other common terms which are always used to refer to mass, not force.

It's the same way with body weight.  We aren't suddenly more fit and healthy if gravity isn't pulling on us as hard.  If you are obese on Earth, you'd have pretty much the same problems related to obesity on Mars. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 23:50, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

===There is no God-given meaning of ''weight'' ===

The word &quot;mass&quot;, on the other hand, has only had this same meaning for about 275 years.  So those heathen tribesmen in merry Olde England weren't making any mistake, when they were unable to discern the God-given word they were supposed to invent for this purpose, instead of the word &quot;weight&quot; which they did invent.

We aren't making any mistake, when we continue to use the same word with the same meaning for the same purposes today. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 23:50, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== Gravity varies significantly on Earth, too ===

Note further that while, if you use Fred Flintstone units such as kilograms-force or pounds-force, you can express the force due to gravity on Earth in numbers approximately equal to those for the corresponding measurements of mass in pounds or kilograms, the same does not hold true in the modern metric system, the International System of Units (SI).  (For that matter, it also does not hold true if you limit yourself to the absolute foot-poound-second system, or if you limit yourself to the gravitational foot-pound-second system, or if you limit yourself to the gravitational inch-pound-second system, etc.)

A mass of 1.00000 lb on Earth will exert a force of from 0.99535 lbf to 1.00260 lbf, and the same of course is true if you use the obsolete kilgrams-force.  But in SI, a mass of 1.00000 kg will exert a force of 9.7610 N to 9.8322 N on Earth.  That certainly matters if you are weighing a 400 oz t bar of platinum, but it also matters at the precision used when a boxer is &quot;making weight&quot;.

Even if you restrict yourself to sea level on Earth, the acceleration of gravity varies by more than 0.53%.  That's easily measurable, not just in the extremes but with very small changes in location. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 23:50, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== This will totally miss the point ==

I totally hate where this article goes, and is a very strong point-of-view that weight is totally silly.  Or that yout weight on another world will be the same as on the Earth.  It totally lacks the NPOV requirements of Wikpedia or all of the Wikimedia projects, and as such needs to be rewritten... perhaps even from scratch.

The whole point of talking about weight on different bodies in the solar system is more &quot;how much would I feel like I weight if I were on X?&quot;

For example, on a videotape I got for my kids, there was a clip of Harrison Schmidt picking up a boulder on the moon.  Tossing it arround and otherwise having a fun time.  Mission control was a little concerned, because the rock did have quite a bit of mass (and the ability to crush,smash helmets and the suit, etc.)  He also showed a very similar rock on the Earth, about the same size and mass, and simply stated there was no way he could possibly lift it up.  This other clip of him in an Arizona desert even showed him trying to lift it up.  He couldn't even budge it.

In short, there is a distinction between mass and weight, and it should be covered.  As written (and in the rest of the articles as written so far) there doesn't appear to be a real distinction, and this discussion is getting down to the ugly fine points that is just splitting hairs.  And rather silly at that.

Here is a distinction that matters to a kid if they were walking (in a spacesuit) on the Moon.  They could &quot;lift&quot; a much heavier rock, because their arms still have the same force and energy necessary to lift things on the Earth, but on the Moon, because gravity is weaker, they can lift more.  Mass is still the same, because if somebody tosses a 10 kg bag of potatoes at you, it will still hit you and knock you down just like it would here on the Earth.  The mass hasn't changed, but the force necessary to lift it has dropped.  Also, on the Moon you can jump up almost 16x as high because of the reduced gravity.  It also takes longer to fall down, again because gravity is lower.  All of this needs to be covered.

The exact opposite happens in high gravity environments, where you shouldn't even try to jump in gravity environments that high (it would break your bones if you tried), but rolling a 10kg ball over could be stopped with just as much force as it would here on the Earth.

Yes, let's be accurate, and let's talking about mass and force correctly (assuming that weight is defined as the force caused by gravity upon a mass of a certain size).  These are kids we are talking about, however, and it is important to let them know that if they were walking on the moon, that they could jump much higher and lift much heavier things.  The real question is how to we explain that idea and how can we describe in something they can understand what it would feel like, using just words? [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:41, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:So, what do you suppose happens when someone throws a 25 lb bag of potatoes at you on the Moon, compared to someone throwing a 25 lb bag of potatoes at you on the Earth?  It will knock you down just like it would here on Earth.

:What do you suppose happens were you to get hit by a 330 lb (150 kg) National Football League lineman on the moon?  Or get punched by a boxer who is in the 90 [[kg]] '''weight class''' for the Olympics?  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 20:51, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

:: Yeah, if you get hit by a 330 lb (150 kg) lineman from the National Football League on the moon (presumably in a large domed habitat like Heinlein's &quot;Meanace From Earth&quot;), the poor center would be flung over the goal post as a result.  Of course that 330 lb lineman can't just use his weight to drop down on somebody taking advantage of gravity, but instead has to use more of a mass concept of gaining momentum before hitting their opponent.

::There are indeed differences, and a game of football (American or International---soccer as it were) would be very different on the Moon.  The Quarterback (in American Football) wouldn't merely be doing a forward pass, but being passed forward himself in a high orbit above the field.  In many ways, it would be more like a game of Quidditch rather than the ground-based game most people are familiar with.  Real life human-powered flight could take place on the Moon, making a game of Quidditch likely to be a real sport on the Moon, broken bones and all.  As for boxing on the Moon, I think you would find it much harder to get a firm footing on the ground.  &quot;Pro wrestling&quot;, like the WWF, would have some incredible fun on the Moon where they could do acrobatics like jumping over their opponent and landing directly on their opponent's head with their feet, or doing other more bizzare gymnastics moves.  Take a look at some of the clients that [http://www.nogravity.com/ Zero G Adventure] has to get an idea.  This is no longer just the stuff of NASA or government astronauts anymore. 

::This reply didn't really answer the question, which is that some sort of terminology needs to be used to describe these effects due to reduced or substantially increased gravity.  So how do we describe it if you are suggesting that using kilograms as a unit of &quot;weight&quot; has the same meaning as on the Earth, and that 100 kg on the Moon is identical to 100 kg on the Earth?  I beg to differ that there are no differences, because there are some very substantial differences as to how you would behave, primarily because our mussels don't push against mass but rather against force.  Saying that you can run and jump like on the Earth when you are on the Moon is simply too ludicrious to even think about.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:33, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

== 110 pounds? ==
I've changed the weights from 110 pounds to 87 pounds (and corresponding metric and stone weights) to more accurately reflect those of a 10 year old boy or girl (average 10yo boy = 85, average 10yo girl = 88), according to [http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/healthcare/a/tallbutfat.htm about.com]). I figured children aged 8-11 wouldn't identify with someone weighing 110 pounds, or at least it would be more relative if it was closer to their weight.--[[User:Tim Thomason|Tim Thomason]] 20:42, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

:Good idea.  I'll tweak it a tiny bit, however, because using 39 kg = 86 lb as a conversion factor would give you an error of only 1 part in 4630 (39.000 kg = 85.980 lb, 86.000 lb = 39.009 kg, whereas using 87 lb = 39 kg would give an error of 1 part in 85).

Nice pictures of the balls falling from the tower, even if they would be pretty huge balls if that's to scale.

Unfortunately, the story in the text isn't true.  Galileo didn't do that.  He did do some experiments rolling balls down an inclined ramp, timing them with a water clock.  See [[w:Galileo Galilei]].  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 09:21, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">A diode usually is thought of as a device that lets current flow through/thru it in only ONE direction; however '''Zener diodes''' are made to permit current to flow also in the reverse direction if the voltage that is applied is larger than the rated &quot;Zener voltage&quot;. Zener diodes are therefore used as voltage sources, with different Zener diodes being available to supply different rated voltages. Resistors are connected in series to limit the current flowing under all applicable conditions, and the current that this voltage source can supply is limited too. Usually, when used as a voltage reference, the current output is quite low.


=Example=

==Reference:==

&quot;Silicon Zener Diode and Rectifier Handbook&quot;, published in 1961 by Motorola, Inc.

===page 6: Current versus voltage relationship of type 50M30Z (&lt;u&gt;50&lt;/u&gt; Watt, &lt;u&gt;30&lt;/u&gt; Volt, &lt;u&gt;Z&lt;/u&gt;ener)===

* In the forward direction, as the voltage is increased from 0, at first negligible current flows until the voltage (V) reaches about 0.75 volts. As V is increased to about 1.2, the current, if there is no external resistance,  is then already about 15 Amperes (A); even more if V is higher.

* In the reverse direction, as V is increased from 0, at first negligible current flows. Then, as the voltage reaches about 29 Volts, the current is about 5 milliamperes (mA). With the applied voltage being about 31 Volts, the current, if no series resistance is in the circuit, is about 1.5 A.

* All diodes have a rated power maximum; type 50M30Z is rated at 50 Watts (W), and Voltage ratings are listed as between 6.8 and 200 V. Characteristics vary with the temperature of the device, but some temperature-compensated types are available. Very small, temperature-compensated, listed Zener diodes for reference purposes are rated at only 400 milliwatts, with Zener voltages of 6.2 or 8.4 V (5% tolerance), for examples.

===page 177: List of 50 Watt Zener diodes===

Two of these listed Zener diodes have, for this example, a Zener knee voltage of about 30 V. They are type number 1N2823 (in TO3 package), and 1N3324 (in stud mounting package); both are otherwise equal. When about 22 Volts are applied in the reverse direction, only about 5 microAmperes can flow, but, at their nominal Zener Voltage of about 30 V, about 420 mA flows, with the maximum permitted DC Zener current (meaning the reverse-direction current a device is expected to be able to carry without damage) of these two types being 1400 mA at 75 degrees Celsius (to be derated if the temperature is higher). The resistance included in the circuit must be sufficiently high to limit the current, at any applied voltage, to that amount. The Zener voltage (at the knee) changes typically about 0.085% per degree Celsius for these two types.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rectifiers''' are used to make DC out of AC. Usually equipment that uses semiconductors, such as TV sets or computers, operate on DC, yet they obtain their power from the AC socket, which is commonly found in buildings.

While the voltage supplied is usually either about 115 or 240 Volt, the equipment connected to this AC supply may use different DC voltages, and there is a need for suitable [[Electronics/Transformers|transformers]] to change the line/mains voltage to whatever is needed. This lower voltage is then fed into a set of rectifier diodes, often in the form of a &quot;rectifier bridge&quot; that consists of 4 rectifier diodes, all 4 often contained in a single plastic package with 4 connections: 2 for the applied AC voltage, and the other 2 for the + and - DC output voltage. Different rectifier ratings exist to provide a suitable range of maximum available output current. The frequency (usually 50 or 60 Hz) is important only for the transformer rating, not the rectifiers.

Normally there is a comparatively large capacitor connected across the DC terminals to &quot;smooth&quot; the DC output voltage, the capacitor's size depending on not only the acceptable maximum &quot;ripple&quot; of the DC output voltage, (AC superimposed on the DC voltage) but also on the maximum current rating of the rectifier arrangement.

=== example ===
Reference: &quot;Silicon Zener Diode and Rectifier Handbook, theory, design characteristics and applications&quot; published in 1961 by Motorola Inc.

* from page 119 &quot;The Diffused-Junction Silicon Rectifier&quot;:
The Forward Current (Amps) versus Forward Voltage (Volts) graph shows that there are slight differences depending on the rectifier's temperature, but only a very small current flows unless the voltage is at least about 0.6 V. The current is about 2 A, with no resistance in the circuit, when the voltage is about 1 V.
* Note that rectifier power ratings must not be exceeded in order to prevent damage, and any graph should also show the proper curve according to the maximum permitted current versus voltage relationship.
*from page 120: The typical static current versus reverse voltage characteristic curves, again depending on the temperature of the rectifier, show that, with a reverse voltage of about 500 V, only about 10 microamperes flow. There are one million microamperes in an Ampere. A breakdown happens if the reverse voltage is too high.

|Comment / Remark
|}

:''The next list is from [[Transwiki:Useful unix command]]. Commands should be merged into the table above, with longer explanations placed somewhere in [[Guide to Unix/Commands]]. X11 commands go in the [[Guide to X11]] book. Some of these are applications (like '''acroread'''); someone needs to find a book or place for them.''

* a2p - translation utility from awk to Perl
* &lt;nowiki&gt; a2ps - translation utility from ``any'' to Postscript &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* ac - print statistics concerning user connect time
* access - determine whether a file can be accessed
* acroread - Adobe utility for viewing pdf files
* adduser - used by root to add user to system
** usage: adduser ''userid''
* afio - utility to copy or restore files to an archive file. This utility is not part of the basic internal and external programs under Red Hat Linux. It is available as an rpm on the rpmfind.net site.
* agetty - enables login on terminals. See getty, mgetty, and uugetty.
* ali - list mail aliases
* alias - assign name to specified command list. This is actually a shell builtin. On my Red Hat system, I have global alias commands in my /etc/bashrc file and in my  /.bashrc file. On my Slackware box, I have made the rm command a little bit safer with
** alias rm='rm -i'
so that you can't recursively delete your /dev directory without telling the system you're sure you want to do it.
* alien - utility to convert to and from different Linux package formats. Can handle Debian (deb), Stampede (stp), Red Hat (rpm) and Slackware (tgz) packages.
* apropos - display command names based on keyword search
** usage: apropos ''keyword''
* apsfilter - printer filter called by lpd to deal with printing different types of files. This is a fairly sophisticated print filter. It is not set up by default in Slackware. It used to be available on the second cd of a Slackware distribution. Since 4.0, it is available as one of the main packages in the ap set. Read the mail that the installation program sends to the root user. I believe that Red Hat uses its own printer filters.
* ar - create, modify and extract from archives
* arch - print machine architecture type
* as - the portable GNU assembler
* asapm - AfterStep laptop advanced power management utility
* ash - a shell, a very simple shell program sometimes used on boot diskettes since it takes up much less space than bash, tcsh, zsh, etc.
* asload - AfterStep cpu load monitor
* asmail - AfterStep mail checking utility
* asmodem - AfterStep utility to monitor modem status
* aspell - a spell checking program along the lines of ispell
* aspostit - X Window postit note utility
* at - executes a shell script at specified time. Use atq to show pending jobs, and atrm to remove jobs from the queue.
** usage: at ''time''
** or: at -f file ''time''
* atq - shows pending jobs queued by at. If run by root, shows everybody's pending jobs.
* atrm - removes pending jobs queued by at. Use atq to determine the identities of various jobs.
** usage: atrm ''job''
* awk - searches for and process patterns in a file
* banner - print banner to standard output. Syntax is
** banner [option] [characters]
* bash - Bourne again shell. This is the default shell in the Red Hat installation.
* batch - queue, examine, or delete jobs for later execution. See at.
* bc - a language (compiler) similar to C, with unlimited precision arithmetic
* &lt;nowiki&gt; bg PID - send process with pid ``PID'' to the background. This is the same as executing &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]z&lt;/tt&gt; while interacting with the running process. This is a shell builtin.
* bh - puts a job in the background. This is a shell builtin.
* biff - mail notification utility. Notifies user of mail arrival and sender's name.
* bind - displays or redefines key bindings. This is a shell builtin.
* bison - parser generator similar to yacc
* bru - a powerful backup utility program. Commercial. Demonstration versions are often included with Linux distributions such as Red Hat.
* bsh - equivalent to ash
* bunzip2 - used to uncompress files compressed with bzip2
* byacc - parser generator
* bzip2 - compresses with algorithm different from gzip
* bzless - view bzipped files
* c++ - invokes GNU C and C++ compiler
* cal - displays a 12-month calendar for the given year or a one-month calendar of the given month
** usage: cal ''month year''
* cat - combine, copy standard input to standard output. Used to join or display files.
* cd - change working directory. This is a shell builtin in bash, tcsh and zsh.
* cdplay - command line utility for playing audio cds
* cfdisk - similar to fdisk, but menu-driven
* chat - used to interact with a modem via a chat script
* chgrp - changes group associated with file. Can be used to change the group associated with subdirectories and files of a directory.
** usage: chgrp ''group files''
** or: chgrp -R ''group files''
* chkconfig - Query or update system services/daemons for different runlevels. Manipulates the various symbolic links in /etc/rc.d. This utility is included with many rpm-based distributions such as RedHat and Mandrake. It is designed to work with System V initialization scripts. Graphical tools for configuring system services include ntsysv, tksysv and ksysv (the latter is a KDE utility).
* chmod - set permissions (modes) of files or directories. A value of 4 is used for read permission. A value of 2 is used for write permission. A value of 1 is used for execute permission. See umask for default file permissions upon file creation. Chmod can also be used to change the suid bit on files. The syntax for the symbolic version is
** chmod [options] who operation permission file-list
The syntax for the absolute version is
** chmod [options] mode file-list
To set the uid to the owner's permissions, use
** chmod u +s file-name
To set the uid to the group's permissions, use
** chmod g +s file-name
There are lots of security issues related to allowing a program to have root's permissions when run by an ordinary user. I don't pretend to understand all of these issues.
* chown - changes ownership of a file. Can be used recursively.
** usage: chown ''userid files''
** or: chown -R ''userid files''
* chsh - change default shell
* ci - creates or records changes in an RCS file
* clear - clear screen command
* cmp - compares two files for differences
** usage: cmp ''file1 file2''
* co - retrieves an unencoded version of an RCS file
* comm - compares sorted files
* configure - automatically configures software source code
* color-xterm - color xterm program. Under Red Hat, this is just a link to xterm-color.
* control-panel - graphical system configuration tool under Red Hat.
* cp - copies on or more files. Recursive copying is one simple way of archiving part of a directory structure. Use the command as follows:
** cp -r /sourcedirectory /targetdirectory
* cpio - direct copy of files to an output device. Allows creation of archive file spanning multiple diskettes. Allows one directory structure to be mirrored elsewhere on the partition or on another partition. In order to back up an entire directory structure on diskettes, cd to the directory and use the following command:
** find . -depth -print &lt;font face=&quot;symbol&quot;&gt;|&lt;/font&gt; cpio -ov &gt; /dev/fd0
To restore from diskettes, use:
** cpio -iv &lt; /dev/fd0
The cpio command will prompt the user to insert more diskettes as they are needed. The command for mirroring a directory structure is the following:
** find . -depth -print &lt;font face=&quot;symbol&quot;&gt;|&lt;/font&gt; cpio -pv /destinationdirectory
This copies the working directory and its contents, including subdirectories, into /destinationdirectory. In order to copy an individual file which is larger than a floppy, use:
** find . -name nameoffile -print &lt;font face=&quot;symbol&quot;&gt;|&lt;/font&gt; cpio -iv &gt; /dev/fd0
* cpkgtool - Slackware tool to install, uninstall and query packages. Front end to installpkg, removepkg, makepkg. This is the graphical version that uses ncurses.

It stores successive revisions of files efficiently and ensures that access to files by multiple developers is done in a controlled manner. Useful when many developers are working on the same project.
* cut - selects characters or TAB-separated fields from lines of input and writes them to standard output
* date - displays or sets date and time
** usage: date
** or: date ''date''
* dd - direct copy of file from one device to another. Can be used to make copies of boot or root diskettes for installing Linux. It can be used, for example, to make and exact copy of a floppy disk, as follows. First, place the diskette to be copied in the floppy drive. Then,
** dd if=/dev/fd0 ibs=512 &gt; floppy.copy
** Replace the diskette with a fresh diskette.
** dd if=floppy.copy bs=512 of=/dev/fd0
The ibs and bs options specify the block sizes for input and for both input and output. A boot disk image can be directly copied to a floppy using the second of the two dd commands above.
* declare - declares attributes for a variable (same as typeset). This is a shell builtin.
* df - displays capacity and free capacity on different physical devices such as hard drive partitions and floppy drives that are mounted on the file system. Gives free space in blocks. With the (undocumented) option -h, the program gives free space in Mb or Gb. This is useful for those accustomed to thinking of the capacity of a high-density 3.5 inch diskette as 1440k.
* diff - displays differences between two files
** usage: diff ''file1 file2''
* diff3 - compares three files and reports on differences
* dip - used to set up a SLIP or PPP connection. It can be used to set up an outgoing SLIP connection or an incoming connection.
* diplogin - used for setting up incoming dip connections. See the man page for dip.
* dir - a variation of the GNU ls command that defaults to printing file names in columns
* dircolors - set colors for GNU ls command. In Slackware, this command is run by the /etc/profile script. Then, whenever xterm is run with the -ls (login shell) option, ls displays different colors for different types of files. Typical usage is eval `dircolors -b`. In Red Hat and Mandrake, I get color directories by aliasing the ls command (see below).
* display - set display for output of programs under X Window. Can be used to run a program on a remote machine while displaying the output on a local machine. The remote machine must have permission to send output to the local machine. This is actually an environment variable. See the more detailed discussion in connection with the xhost command below.
* dmesg - displays messages from /var/log relative to the most recent boot
* dos - invoke the DOSEMU DOS emulator

* dvilj - send a dvi file to a Laserjet printer. There are specialized versions for individual models of Laserjet printer.
* dvilj2p - specialized version of dvilj for the IIp series of printers. See above.
* dvips - send a dvi file to a Postscript printer, to a Postscript capable Laserjet printer, or to a file (with the -o option). There is a switch to print only a subset of the pages, and another switch to print in landscape mode. Use -t landscape, which is one of the arguments to the paper type switch. If you have one page of a document that is a wide table, and you wish to print this in landscape mode, use
** dvips ''filename -pp pagenumber -t landscape''
* e2fsck - check an ext2 filesystem. The syntax is
** e2fsck ''/dev/devicename''
where the filesystem is on /dev/devicename. The device should not be mounted, and this program must be run as root.

Following the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what the correct response should be. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control structures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script. &lt;/nowiki&gt;

* fgrep - search for patterns in files
* file - displays classification of a file or files according to the type of data they contain
* find - find files according to a large variety of search criteria. The find command that I use the most is

* getkeycodes - print kernel's scancode-to-keycode mapping table
* ghostscript - set of printing utilities. It seems to be obligatory to have this if a T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X installation such as teT&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X is installed. How they communicate with one another is somewhat obscure.
* ghostview - Aladdin ghostscript interpreter/previewer
* gimp - image manipulation and paint program
* glint - Red Hat graphical front end for the rpm package installer and manager.
* grep - used to find a string within a file. The -i option returns matches without regard to case. The -n option means that each line of output is preceded by file name and line number. The -v option causes non-matched lines to be printed.

** or: grep -i ''pattern files''
** or: grep -n ''pattern files''
** or: grep -v ''pattern files''
* groupadd - create a new group on the system
* groups - shows which groups you are in
* &lt;nowiki&gt; grub - Gnu grand unified bootloader. Can be used instead of lilo to boot multiple operating systems. I encountered a couple of snafus trying to install grub on my home machine after installing Mandrake 8.0 and choosing the lilo bootloader during the initial install. The Mandrake installation program set up /boot/vmlinuz as a symlink to the actual kernel, vmlinuz-2.4.3-20mdk. It took me a while to figure out that grub doesn't understand symbolic links. The documentation suggests installing grub on a diskette using the ``dd'' command. This refused to work, but &lt;/nowiki&gt;
** grub-install '(fd0)'
did work. The single quotes are necessary. The files necessary to run grub are normally located in /boot/grub. Once the file menu.lst has been edited and appropriated entries added to boot the different operating systems on one's hard disk(s), the following sequence of commands can be used to install grub in the master boot record (MBR) sector of the hard disk:
** root (hd0,''x'')
** setup (hd0)
Here, the ''x'' should be replaced by the partition where the /boot/grub directory is located, which is probably the root partition of the Linux system. Note that grub has its own conventions for naming devices and numbering partitions, so that for example a partition which is called hda6 under Linux will be called (hd0,5) by grub.

Ldconfig checks the header and file names of the libraries it encounters when determining which versions should have their links updated. Ldconfig ignores symbolic links when scanning for libraries.
* ldd - list the shared libraries on which a given executable depends, and where they are located
* leave - display reminder at specified time
* &lt;nowiki&gt; less - Linux alternative to ``more'' command. Displays text files, one screenful at a time. When less pauses, there is a large number of available commands to tell it what to do next. One can scroll both forwards and backwards. &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* let - evaluates a numeric expression. This is a shell builtin.
* lilo - installs boot loader on the boot sector of a hard drive, of a diskette, or in another location. My 486 has a hard drive that is too large for the machine's BIOS, so I have to boot from a floppy. To create a boot diskette, I do the following (as root):
** /sbin/fdformat /dev/fd0H1440
** /sbin/mkfs.ext2 /dev/fd0
** mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
** cp -dp /boot/* /mnt/floppy
** /sbin/lilo -C /etc/lilo.flop
The -C option to lilo has lilo use the lilo.flop file instead of the default lilo.conf.
* linuxconf - interactive tool for configuring Linux system. Uses X if loaded. This is a Gnome tool. It comes with my Red Hat distribution, and is not included with Slackware. It would seem to be the easiest way to configure Linux under Slackware. Version 1.15 is available for Slackware. There is a pretty good introduction to the use of linuxconf in the Red Hat 5.2 installation manual, which is available online at their web site.
* ln - creates a link to a file. Used to create hard links and, with the -s option, symbolic links which can link files on different disk partitions. The syntax is

* magicfilter - general purpose printer filter. See apsfilter above. apsfilter is the printer filter that comes with the Red Hat and Slackware distributions.
* mail - sends or reads electronic mail
* make - keeps a set of programs current. This is a utility that helps when developing a set of programs. It works by executing a script called makefile, Makefile or GNUmakefile in the working directory. It is very often used in combination with configure when compiling and installing noncompiled software packages.

* nm - lists the symbols from object files objfile. If no object files are given as arguments, nm assumes `a.out'.
* nohup - runs a command that keeps running after logout. The command is in principle immune to hangups, and must have output to a non tty. According to ''Linux in a Nutshell'', this is necessary only in the Bourne shell, since modern shells preserve background processes by default.
* ntsysv - run level editor under Red Hat. This is the equivalent of tksysv, but does not require a graphical interface.

* reset - used to reset the screen characteristics. This is useful if the screen gets messed up from, for example, trying to display a binary file in an xterm.
* return - exits from a function. This is a shell builtin.
* rlog - prints a summary of the history of an RCS file
* rlogin - log in to remote computer. The general syntax is as follows, using the UQAM Nobel machine as an example:
** rlogin -l userid nobel.si.uqam.ca
The remote computer must recognize the local user and the local machine. See the rcp command for how to set up the .rhosts file on the remote machine.
* rm - remove files or directories. With the -r (recursive) option (very dangerous!), can be used to remove the contents of a specified directory including all subdirectories.
* rmail - interpret and handle remote mail received via uucp
* rmdir - remove empty directories
* rmmod - used to remove modular device drivers
* route -n - show routing table. The n option returns numerical addresses rather than names.
* rpm - invokes the Red Hat package manager in command line mode. I often use this command in query mode to query packages about what files they contain and to find out which package owns a particular file. Examples are
** rpm -qil foo. Gives package information and a file list for the package foo.
** rpm -qfil foo. Gives package information and a file list for the package that owns the file foo. Foo must be in the working directory, or the full path to foo must be specified.
We need to find out about installing the rpm package on a Slackware box. It's probably better to use a package converter such as alien.
* rpm2tgz - an extremely useful utility on Slackware systems that converts rpm packages to tgz format. They can then be installed using the installpkg command (or pkgtool).
* rsh - execute shell command on a remote computer. See rcp and rlogin.

* rxvt - a terminal program similar to xterm, but which has less features and uses less memory
* sed - edits a file (not interactively). Also a tool for processing text files.
* set - set or display value of shell variables. This is a shell builtin. The command

* setup - Slackware program to set up program sets and configure system. Setup devices and file systems, mount root file system
* sh - standard Unix shell. On Linux, just another name for bash.
* shift - promotes each command-line argument. This is a shell builtin.

** umask xyz
The system subtracts x, y and z from the owner, group and other file permissions that it would otherwise assign to new files. This is a shell builtin.
* umount [device] - finish writing to the device and remove it from the active filesystem. The command umount -a will (re)mount all file systems listed in /etc/fstab.
* unalias - remove name previously defined by alias. This is a shell builtin.
* uname - displays information about the system. With no arguments, it displays the name of the operating system. With the -a option, it displays information about the operating system, the host name, and hardware.
* uniq - displays lines of a file that are unique
* unset - removes a variable or function. This is a shell builtin.
* unzip - uncompress files compressed with the zip utility, compatible with DOS PKzip
* updatedb - update file database used by locate command
* uptime - shows the time, how long the system has been up, the number of users, and average load.
* useradd - same as adduser
* userdel - remove an account (as root). The user's home directory and undelivered mail must be dealt with separately.
* users - prints list of users on the system
* vdir - variant of the GNU version of the ls command. Defaults to printing out the long version of directory entries.
* [[Learning the vi Editor|vi]] - standard screen oriented Unix editor
* view - vi in read-only mode
* [[Learning the vi Editor/Vim|vim]] - improved vi editor
* vrfy - query remote host to verify the accuracy of an email address
* w - display info about userids and active processes
* wait - waits for a background process to terminate. This is a shell builtin.
* wc - displays number of lines, characters and words in a file
* Wharf - the AfterStep application dock module
* whatis - display one-line summary of specified command
* whereis - use to find utilities in standard locations
* which - used to find utilities in search path. Will return the absolute directory path of the named utility program.
* who - display information about currently logged in userids
* whoami - display information about userid that is currently logged in
* wish - front end to tk, an X window extension of tcl
* workbone - console based cd player
* workman - graphical cd player program
* write - send messages to another local user
* X - the X server
* xadm - display advanced power management BIOS information
* xargs - converts standard output of one command into arguments for another. This is one of those powerful but obscure commands. Xargs reads arguments from the standard input, delimited by blanks (which can be protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or newlines, and executes the command (default is /bin/echo) one or more times with any initial-arguments followed by arguments read from standard input. Blank lines on the standard input are ignored.
* xbiff - graphical mail delivery notification utility
* xcalc - simple calculator program
* xclipboard - name says it all
* Xconfigurator - Red Hat utility for configuring settings for X
* xdm - used to start an X login session. This can be used to start a login session on a remote system. See the discussion on the following site:
** [http://www.menet.umn.edu/~kaszeta/unix/xterminal/index.html &lt;tt&gt;http://www.menet.umn.edu/~kaszeta/unix/xterminal/index.html&lt;/tt&gt;]
See the man pages for X, xdm, and Xserver. As usual, the man pages are pretty obscure. The best single source seems to be the Xserver man pages. After X is configured, X needs to be started at bootup with the command (in /etc/rc.d/init.d/xterm):
** X -quiet -query remotemachineaddress
If the address of a nameserver is not configured, then the numeric address of the remote machine rather than its name should be entered. If the machines are connected through ethernet cards and the net, then obviously basic networking has to be set up. Gnome and KDE come with their own versions of X display/login managers, called respectively gdm and kdm.
* xdvi - view a dvi file compiled under L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X
* xedit - a simple text editor for X
* xf86config - graphical configuration tool for X
* XF86Setup - graphical configuration tool for X
* xfd - display an available font in X. Creates a grid in an x-term with one character per rectangle.
* xfig - utility for interactive generation of figures
* xfm - graphical file manager for X
* xhost - tell X server that remote computer has access to your machine and that you will use the remote computer. This can be used to set up remote X sessions. To set up a remote X session on the UQAM Nobel machine, run the following command on the local machine (one doesn't have to be root to do this)
** xhost +nobel.si.uqam.ca
Then, log onto the remote machine using rlogin (see above) or telnet. Once logged in, use the following command to get the remote X server to open an X terminal on the local machine:
** setenv DISPLAY localhostname:0 ; xterm &amp;
This is valid for csh, which is the default login shell on Nobel. For ksh, (and I think bash) replace with
** DISPLAY=localhostname:0
** export DISPLAY ; xterm
Other X-based programs such as Netscape or Gauss (graphical version) can also be run on a remote machine with display on the local machine with little trouble. The local X server is the program that has all of the information concerning the properties of the graphics card and terminal, so it must be necessary to have X running on the local machine. The following should also work. After using xhost to give permission to the remote machine to display on the local machine, use
** netscape -display localhostname:0.0
Question: can one start the X session on the local machine and then run a remote copy of a window manager?
* xinit - start X Window. The command startx is a front end to xinit in Linux, including Slackware.
* xload - displays a graphic of the system load
* xlpq - graphical interface to print manager. This is included on one of the XFCE menus, but does not seem to be a part of the base Red Hat distribution.
* xlsfonts - list fonts available under the X Window system.
* xman - browsable command reference. Displays manual pages under X.
* xmh - graphical front end under X to the nmh mail handling system. This program is part of the XFree86 package in Red Hat.
* xmodmap - utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings in X. Can be used to install a French Canadian keyboard. Download the Xmodmap.cf file from www.linux-quebec.org, and insert the command
** xmodmap /etc/X11/Xmodmap.cf &amp;
into the .xession (with xdm) or the .xinitrc (with startx) file.
* xosview - displays bar graphs of system load, load average, memory usage, and swap usage
* xpaint - simple paint program for X
* xpdf - GPL'd utility for previewing dvi files. Doesn't seem to work too well on texts with a lot of math.
* xplaycd - X Window audio cd player utility
* xsetroot - utility to configure root window of an X terminal
* xsysinfo - graphical display of load and memory usage
* xterm - start an X Window terminal session
* xterm-color - color version of xterm
* xv - utility for viewing and manipulating many types of image files. This is a shareware program.
* xvidtune - utility for fine tuning of monitor settings under X
* xwd - screen capture command
* xwud - view images captured with xwd
* yacc - parser generator
* ytalk - multi-user program similar to talk
* zcat - read one or more files that have been compressed with gzip or compress and write to standard output
* zcmp - read compressed files and pass them to cmp

== How Industry Affected Laborers ==

During the machine age, there were a number of strikes that took place due to the demands from factories and time clocks. It was hard for individuals to adjust to that system, and as a result, they challenged the system by ignoring management's orders, skipping work, or quitting. The desire and longing for better wages led to anxiety and frustration. Like farming and mining, industry was massive in size and changed not only the nature of the work, but the person doing it. Soon, all of these disgruntled individuals formed specialized groups into unions. The different jobs varied in not only skill, but other things as well that were non-related to worker conflict; race, sex, ect. These jobs were such as working on/in railroads, steel factories, and automobiles.  The outcome for many working in labor during the Gilded Age led to horrific labor violence. Industrialists and workers literally fought over control of the workplace. Many suffered due to the strikes and riots and it inevitably led to deaths, loss of jobs, and often continuous violence. For most American workers, the Machine age had varying results. At times there was no job stability and when costs of living would increase drastically there were even more problems.</text>

Hello! I'm an entrepreneur and language enthusiast currently residing in Wyandotte, Michigan, USA. In addition to native English, I speak Japanese, Portuguese, French, and a bit of Korean, Spanish, and Chinese. In addition to language study, I enjoy classical music, business education, computers, and Japanese literature. Thanks for visiting my page.

I'm currently contributing to the [[Japanese]] Wikibook as a supplement to a free course I'm teaching in Riverview, Michigan.

Feel free to leave me a message on the discussion page, or e-mail me at aaronsama@yahoo.com, and include &quot;Wikibooks&quot; in the subject line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Best Practices in Water Resources Planning'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

== Overview of Planning ==

In general, planning is analysis to identify a &quot;best&quot; set of actions to attain a more desirable future for someone (some intended beneficiary).  Planning analyses vary in scope, scale and level of detail, according to:
* who is the intended beneficiary (ex: a country, a community, a business, an individual)
* what types of future conditions are desired
* what range of actions will be considered for attaining the future conditions.

== Generic Problem to be Solved ==
In general, planning analyses are initiated because someone (possibly the intended beneficiary) perceives that planning is needed.  That is, someone perceives a &quot;problem&quot; (that the future condition is not likely to meet expectations) or someone perceives an &quot;opportunity&quot; (that the future condition could be better if some actions were taken).

This delicious sour cream and onion dip will bring back memories of carefully emptying a dried soup envelope into a tub of sour cream and gently trying to push the salty mass into the center so you can stir it without choking on instant soup dust. This recipe delivers richer, fresher flavor. Eat it with potato crisps.

==Ingredients==
*&amp;frac12; medium [[Cookbook:onion|onion]] (white or yellow), minced
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
*1 Instant vegetable [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|bouillon cube]] (enough to make 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of bouillon)
*&amp;frac14; cup water
*1 cup [[Cookbook:sour cream|sour cream]]
*&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] onion powder
*[[Cookbook:salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==
In a small saucepan, sweat the onion gently with a pinch of salt and pepper until it becomes transparent. Then, increase heat and sauté until the onion becomes golden-brown and forms a sticky mass. Add the water and bouillon cube (crushed) and simmer until some of the water has evaporated and the liquid is thick. Remove the pan from the heat and add the sour cream--stir until smooth. Add the onion powder and taste. Add salt and pepper if desired. Refrigerate before serving. Makes about 1&amp;frac12; cups.

==Purpose of this text==
It has become something of a tradition that in communication theory seminars students provide some form of a &quot;brief&quot; of major theories, or an intellectual biography for a significant theorist. The Internet complicated this a bit, since many people now post these in one form or another. The approach taken here was to capture the results of a small seminar at the University at Buffalo, and make the work available to others. The hope is that this small set of chapters will encourage others to post their own versions.

Since a book is hardly a book (particularly when it comes to text books) unless there is some unified approach or schema, the assignment asked participants to pick out a theorist and use this person as an entry point into a range of theories. We would ask that those who contribute to the book read over the existing chapters and get a feel for the approach in order to provide a generalized feel throughout.


== Theoretical perspective ==
I'm wondering if this is going to be a humanities approach to communications, or an engineering approach to communications? Are you talking about the ways people communicate and the effect it has, or are you talking on the specifics of communication schemes? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:50, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

: We are coming from the perspective of the social sciences and humanities. There is considerable ambiguity in the terms used, but I think there is something of a threshing out of this, with &quot;communication theory&quot; in the engineering sense often being enveloped by &quot;Information Theory.&quot; That's the way it has (eventually) been sorted out over on Wikipedia. [[User:Halavais|Halavais]] 15:23, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

==A Good Beginning==
Not a bad start.  Make sure that Marcuse is added to the Frankfurt school.  Also, a section on modernity and communication, featuring Habermas, Harvey, et al. will bring facilitate a more complete understanding of communication situated within a historical context.  A section of conservative critique would also be benificial, featuring J.S. Mill and others on the implications of the mediocre mass that arises from a liberal-democratic model of communication. [[User:Sarkisian|Sarkisian]] 30 January 2006 (UTC)

== Naming convention ==

This book does not follow [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. I suggest renaming pages using slash convention. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 22:24, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks! Fixed (I think) [[User:Halavais|Halavais]] 15:23, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

== Structure ==

This is a great start, but I'm a bit shaky on the organizational structure.  Perhaps one of us can systematically categorize the communication theories by the traditional contexts of semiotic, phenomenological, cybernetic, sociopsychological, sociocultural, and critical.  I think your current approach is effective, and should remain intact; however, a supplementary chart that shows where these theories fall within the larger spectrum would also be of great help.  I recommend the helpful charts in the back of Theories of Human Communication by Littlejohn and Foss, 8th edition, as a starting point.  If I can get around to it, I will post a sample on this discussion page of what I mean.  -- --[[User:bersumm|bersumm]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Dynamic polymorphism (Overrides)====
So far, we have learned that we can add new data and functions to a class through inheritance. But what about if we want our derived class to inherit a method from the base class, but to have a different implementation for it? That is when we are talking about polymorphism, a fundamental concept in OOP programming.

As seen previously in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Paradigms|Programming Paradigms Section]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Polymorphism|Polymorphism]] is subdivided in two concepts ''static polymorphism'' and ''dynamic polymorphism''. This section concentrates on dynamic polymorphism, which applies in C++ when a derived class overrides a function declared in a base class.

We implement this concept redefining the method in the derived class. However, we need to have some considerations when we do this, so now we must introduce the concepts of dynamic binding, static binding and virtual methods.

Suppose that we have two classes, &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; derives from &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and redefines the implementation of a method &lt;code&gt;c()&lt;/code&gt; that resides in class &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. Now suppose that we have an object &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; of class &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. How should the instruction &lt;code&gt;b.c()&lt;/code&gt; be interpreted?

If &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is declared in the stack (not declared as a pointer or a reference) the compiler applies static binding, this means it interprets (at compile time) that we refer to the implementation of &lt;code&gt;c()&lt;/code&gt; that resides in &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;.

However, if we declare &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; as a pointer or a reference of class &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, the compiler could not know which method to call at compile time, because &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; can be of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. If this is resolved at run time, the method that resides in &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; will be called. This is called dynamic binding. If this is resolved at compile time, the method that resides in A will be called. This is again, static binding.

===== Virtual member functions =====
The &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; member functions is relatively simple, but often misunderstood. The concept is an essential part of designing a class hierarchy in regards to sub-classing classes as it determines the behavior of overridden methods in certain contexts.

Virtual member functions are class member functions, that can be overridden in any class derived from the one where they were declared. The member function body is then replaced with a new set of implementation in the derived class.

{{NOTE|When overriding virtual functions you can alter the private, protected or public state access state of the member function of the derived class.}}

By placing the keyword &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; before a method declaration we are indicating that when the compiler has to decide between applying static binding or dynamic binding it will apply dynamic binding. Otherwise, static binding will be applied.

{{NOTE|While it is not required to use the virtual keyword in our subclass definitions (since if the base class function is virtual all subclass overrides of it will also be virtual) it is good style to do so when producing code for future reutilization (for use outside of the same project).}}

Again, this should be clearer with an example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Foo
{
public:
  void f()
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Foo::f()&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
  virtual void g()
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Foo::g()&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
};
 
class Bar : public Foo
{
public:
  void f()
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Bar::f()&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
  virtual void g()
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Bar::g()&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
};
 
int main()
{
  Foo foo;
  Bar bar;

  Foo *baz = &amp;bar;
  Bar *quux = &amp;bar;

  foo.f(); // &quot;Foo::f()&quot;
  foo.g(); // &quot;Foo::g()&quot;
 
  bar.f(); // &quot;Bar::f()&quot;
  bar.g(); // &quot;Bar::g()&quot;

  // So far everything we would expect...
 
  baz-&gt;f();  // &quot;Foo::f()&quot;
  baz-&gt;g();  // &quot;Bar::g()&quot;

  quux-&gt;f(); // &quot;Bar::f()&quot;
  quux-&gt;g(); // &quot;Bar::g()&quot;
 
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Our first calls to &lt;tt&gt;f()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;g()&lt;/tt&gt; on the two objects are straightforward. However things get interesting with our baz pointer which is a pointer to the Foo type.

&lt;tt&gt;f()&lt;/tt&gt; is not &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; and as such a call to &lt;tt&gt;f()&lt;tt&gt; will always invoke the implementation associated with the pointer type -- in this case the implementation from Foo.

{{NOTE|Remember that [[C++ Programming/Classes/Member Functions#Overloading|overloading]] and [[C++ Programming/Classes/Polymorphism|overriding]] are distinct concepts.}}

Virtual function calls are computationally more expensive than regular function calls. Virtual functions use pointer indirection, invocation and will require a few extra instructions than normal member functions. They also require that the constructor of any class/structure containing virtual functions to initialize a table of pointers to its virtual member functions. 

All this characteristics will signify a trade-off between performance and design. One should avoid preemptively declaring functions virtual without an existing structural need. Keep in mind that virtual functions that are only resolved at run-time cannot be inlined.

{{TODO|Example of issue of virtual and inline.}}

{{NOTE|Some of the needs for using virtual functions can be addressed by using a class template. This will be covered when we introduce [[C++ Programming/Templates|Templates]].}}

====== Pure virtual member function ======
There is one additional interesting possibility. Sometimes we don't want to provide an implementation of our function at all, but want to require people sub-classing our class to provide an implementation on their own. This is the case for ''pure'' virtuals.

To indicate a pure &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; function instead of an implementation we simply add an &quot;&lt;tt&gt;= 0&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; after the function declaration.

Again -- an example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Widget
{
public:
   virtual void paint() = 0;
};

class Button : public Widget
{
public:
   void paint() // is virtual because it is an override
   {
       // do some stuff to draw a button
   }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Because &lt;tt&gt;paint()&lt;/tt&gt; is a pure &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; function in the Widget &lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt; we are required to provide an implementation in all concrete subclasses. If we don't the compiler will give us an error at build time.

This is helpful for providing interfaces -- things that we expect from all of the objects based on a certain hierarchy, but when we want to ignore the implementation details.

;So why is this useful?
Let's take our example from above where we had a pure &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; for painting. There are a lot of cases where we want to be able to do things with widgets without worrying about what kind of widget it is. Painting is an easy example.

Imagine that we have something in our application that repaints widgets when they become active. It would just work with pointers to widgets -- i.e. &lt;tt&gt;Widget *activeWidget() const&lt;/tt&gt; might be a possible function signature. So we might do something like:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
Widget *w = window-&gt;activeWidget();
w-&gt;paint();
&lt;/source&gt;

We want to actually call the appropriate paint member function for the &quot;real&quot; widget type -- not &lt;tt&gt;Widget::paint()&lt;/tt&gt; (which is a &quot;pure&quot; &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; and will cause the program to crash if called using virtual dispatch). By using a &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; function we insure that the member function implementation for our subclass -- &lt;tt&gt;Button::paint()&lt;/tt&gt; in this case -- will be called.

{{TODO|Mention interface classes|C++ Programming}}

====== Covariant return types ======
Covariant return types is the ability for a virtual function in a derived class to return a pointer or reference to an instance of itself if the version of the method in the base class does so. e.g.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class base
{
public:
  virtual base* create() const;
};

class derived : public base
{
public:
  virtual derived* create() const;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This allows casting to be avoided.

{{NOTE|Some older compilers do not have support for covariant return types.  Workarounds exist for such compilers.}}

===== virtual Constructors =====
There is a hierarchy of classes with base class &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt;. Given an object &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt; belonging in the hierarchy, it is desired to be able to do the following:
#Create an object &lt;tt&gt;baz&lt;/tt&gt; of the same class as &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt; (say, class &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt;) initialized using the default constructor of the class. The syntax normally used is:
#:&lt;tt&gt;Bar* baz = bar.create();&lt;/tt&gt;
#Create an object &lt;tt&gt;baz&lt;/tt&gt; of the same class as &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt; which is a copy of &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;. The syntax normally used is:
#:&lt;tt&gt;Bar* baz = bar.clone();&lt;/tt&gt;

In the class &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt;, the methods &lt;tt&gt;Foo::create()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Foo::clone()&lt;/tt&gt; are declared as follows:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Foo
{
    // ...

    public:
        // Virtual default constructor
        virtual Foo* create() const;

        // Virtual copy constructor
        virtual Foo* clone() const;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

If &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; is to be used as an abstract class, the functions may be made pure virtual:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Foo
{
   // ...

    public:
        virtual Foo* create() const = 0;
        virtual Foo* clone() const = 0;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to support the creation of a default-initialized object, and the creation of a copy object, each class &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; in the hierarchy must have public default and copy constructors. The virtual constructors of &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; are defined as follows:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Bar : ... // Bar is a descendant of Foo
{
    // ...

    public:
    // Non-virtual default constructor
    Bar ();
    // Non-virtual copy constructor
    Bar (const Bar&amp;);

    // Virtual default constructor, inline implementation
    Bar* create() const { return new Foo (); }
    // Virtual copy constructor, inline implementation
    Bar* clone() const { return new Foo (*this); }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code uses [[#Covariant return types|covariant return types]]. If your compiler doesn't support &lt;tt&gt;Bar* Bar::create()&lt;/tt&gt;, use &lt;tt&gt;Foo* Bar::create()&lt;/tt&gt; instead, and similarly for &lt;tt&gt;clone()&lt;/tt&gt;.

While using these virtual constructors, you ''must'' manually deallocate the object created by calling &lt;tt&gt;'''delete''' baz;&lt;/tt&gt;. This hassle could be avoided if a smart pointer (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;std::auto_ptr&lt;Foo&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) is used in the return type instead of the plain old &lt;tt&gt;Foo*&lt;/tt&gt;.

Remember that whether or not &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; uses dynamically allocated memory, you ''must'' define the destructor &lt;tt&gt;'''virtual''' ~Foo ()&lt;/tt&gt; and make it &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; to take care of deallocation of objects using pointers to an ancestral type.

===== virtual Destructor =====
It is of special importance to remember to define a virtual destructor even if empty in any base class, since failing to do so will create problems with the default compiler generated destructor that will not be virtual.

A virtual destructor is not overridden when redefined in a derived class, the definitions to each destructor are cumulative and they start from the last derivate class toward the first base class.

====== Pure virtual Destructor ======
Every abstract class should contain the declaration of a pure virtual destructor. 

Pure virtual destructors are a special case of pure virtual functions (meant to be overridden in a derived class). They must always be defined and that definition should always be empty.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Interface {
public:
  virtual ~Interface() = 0; //declaration of a pure virtual destructor 
};

Interface::~Interface(){} //pure virtual destructor definition (should always be empty)
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
This Appendix contains the top 30 questions people ask when using Mac hardware and software. It's a good idea to read through this section before you use your Mac, as it will clarify some of the things you are likely to need answers to at first.

=The Questions=
==I don't like the Apple mouse.  How can I use my own mouse with my Mac?==
If you'd prefer to use a non-Apple mouse, as many Mac users do, Apple is happy to accommodate you. Simply plug your mouse into your Mac and it will be automatically recognized, multiple buttons, scroll wheel, and all. You can use a PS/2 mouse with a PS/2 to USB adapter. Some mice require special software to work properly.

==How do I right-click?==
You can perform the equivalent of right-clicking in OS X by either holding down the mouse button, or by pressing Ctrl and clicking at the same time. If you have a Mighty Mouse (the mouse that ships with all modern Macs) you can also configure this for right clicking. Have a look in &quot;Keyboard &amp; Mouse&quot; under System Preferences. Also, if you have a laptop Mac, you can do a right-click by clicking the touchpad with two fingers while properly configured.

==How does my CD/DVD Drive Work?==
Apple often uses slot loading optical drives that aren't commonly used by other computer makers. The way of interacting with the drives is also different from most others. If your drive looks like a thin slot, insert a disc and push it into the computer. The drive will catch onto the disc and read it. To eject the disc, press and hold the Eject key in the upper right-hand corner of your keyboard for a second.

{{Info|'''TIP:''' If a slot-load drive misbehaves and refuses to eject a disc, it means that the disc didn't lodge correctly inside and is assumed to not be in at all. The fix is to shut down (not restart) your computer. Then turn it on while holding down the left/only mouse button. This is your way of telling the drive, &quot;You ate my disc!&quot;, and it will attempt to spit it out.}}

If your drive is of the tray variety, press and hold your Eject key, or F12 on some keyboards, to open and close it. There is also an eject button next to the tray drives on some Macs, but this only works when a disc is already in the drive.
If you are using a non-Apple or old Apple keyboard, you don't have an eject key. Right-click the disc's icon and choose &quot;Eject&quot; instead.

==A Program has crashed and won't quit! What do I do?==
Forcing an application to quit is called &quot;Force Quitting&quot; it. To do this, press ⌘⌥⎋ (Apple/Command-Option-Escape), choose the name of the crashed application from the list, and click the pulsating blue &quot;Force Quit&quot; button.

==How do I empty the Trash?==
The simplest way is to choose &quot;Empty Trash&quot; from the Finder menu (shortcut: ⇧⌘⌫). The Finder must be the frontmost application for this menu to appear in the menu bar. You can also press and hold the trash icon, and a menu will appear with an &quot;Empty Trash&quot; option.

==Why can't I cut files using Finder?==
If you were a Windows user you may wonder why OS X doesn't allow you to &quot;cut&quot; files and then paste them somewhere else in Finder. Apple has chosen to disable this feature for various reasons. The easiest alternative is to move the file(s) by dragging and dropping using the &quot;spring-loaded folders&quot; feature.  

==Where can I get support?==
There are many resources available where you may seek help. First, basic questions may be answered in your Mac's, or an application's help files. New computers come with 90 days of telephone support and one year of limited parts coverage. AppleCare extends that coverage to 3 years of telephone support and parts coverage. There are also numerous communities that will assist you with your Mac (usually in the form of forums), including Apple's very own &quot;Discussions&quot; area of the support section on their site. More resources can be found on Apple's support site, or third party documentation, which can usually be found through search engines. You may also receive free support at any one of Apple's Genius bars (with appointment). Some technicians may also be able to assist you, at a price. 

==How do I select multiple items on some web forms?==
Under Windows, you may be used to holding down the &quot;shift&quot; or &quot;control&quot; keys to select multiple items.  In Mac OS X, use the Command key instead of Control to select items that aren't next to each other.  Holding Shift allows you to select a number of items that are all together.  The Control key is normally used to display a contextual menu when using a single-button mouse.  If you have a two button mouse, you can right-click to achieve the same thing.

==Where can I find a program for...==
Finding software for Macs can be hard at times since it's not used as much as Windows in many contexts. Fortunately there are sites like [http://www.versiontracker.com versiontracker.com] and [http://www.macupdate.com macupdate.com] which have databases of the newest versions of most OS X software. Another good resource is [http://macintoshsoftware.net MacintoshSoftware.net] . If you can't find the software you need there, ask on a forum.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The football field may differ slightly from place to place, but all football fields have some things in common. One of the first things one notices about a football field is that it has a 100-yard middle capped off by 10-yard end zones. These end zones are distinguished by markings on the field. Also, the field is surrounded by a giant white line. At the side of the field, this line forms the sideline of the field. There are fine white markings down the middle of the field. These are hash marks, which the ball is always placed between before it is snapped, and the spacing depends on what type of football is being played. The thick white lines running the width of the field are yard lines, which aid in the determination of the ball's position. Above each end zone is a crossbar.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The offense is the bread and butter of a team's scoring, so naturally, it is the most exciting part of the game. The offensive unit consists of five offensive linemen and six &quot;skilled&quot; players. One of the skilled players is usually the quarterback, who initiates offensive plays and is the offense's focal point. The other skilled players may be running backs, who are either halfbacks or fullbacks, wide receivers, and tight ends. Each player's job in a play depends on what kind of play it is, but mainly, it depends on whether it is a running or a passing play.

The offensive lineman's job is simple, and it leads to their sheer size on the field. A lineman's size should not be underappreciated because being squashed by one of these guys can be quite painful and is not good for your health in the long term. They are required to keep defensive linemen and linebackers away from the running back and quarterback. They do this by simple blocking, but some linemen will &quot;pancake&quot; a defender, which means that the defender is pushed to the ground. If a defender is pancaked, the defense is essentially short by one man. A lineman does not want a defensive player to push past him, but this happens on almost every play.

No discussion of the offense is complete without mentioning the quarterback's duties. He calls for the ball to be snapped from the center to initiate the play. On a running play, the quarterback does not do much other than hand the ball off. On a passing play, however, the quarterback gets to shine. He must throw the ball to an open receiver before the defense gets to him. The position of quarterback is arguably the most demanding position in football.

The position of running back requires a good deal of bravery. One of the running back's jobs is obvious from the name; he runs with the ball, hoping to gain good yardage and possibly a touchdown. Another job is blocking, and the fullback, who is generally bigger than the halfback, does this often. A halfback on a team with a strong passing game can expect to block a lot, though. The running backs can also catch passes. This can create mismatches for the defense.

The wide receiver is the main passing threat on offense. He is normally one of the smallest and fastest men on the field. They are required to catch passes from the quarterback (and, occasionally, the halfback). When a team looks for big yardage, the wide receiver is normally who it turns to. The wide receivers don't play a big role in running plays; they generally lead cornerbacks and safeties upfield so the running back can cover more ground.

Although every skilled position seems to call for multiple offensive talents, the tight end has the most split job after the quarterback. On some plays, they act just like offensive linemen and block defenders. On other plays, particularly near the opponent's goal line, they can catch passes. This makes them dangerous on the field.</text>

== 1. Describe the function of the following tools: ==
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Bandsaw at Lowes.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Bandsaw&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Belt_sander_bosch.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Belt Sander&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Decoupeerzaag.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Jig Saw&lt;/center&gt;

Image:Wood_router_jmc_2005_03_12.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Router&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Shaper_osha.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Shaper&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Band Saw ===
A '''band saw''' is a saw that can be used for woodworking, metal working, and a variety of other materials. It gets its name from its blade, consisting of a narrow band of toothed metal. This band rides on two large wheels stacked vertically with a space between them. Band saws are particularly useful for cutting irregular shapes. The radius of a curve that can be cut on a particular saw is determined by the width of the band.

=== Belt Sander ===
A belt sander is a machine used to quickly sand down wood and other materials for finishing purposes. It consists of a motor that turns a pair of drums on which a seamless loop of sandpaper is mounted. Belt sanders can be either hand-held, where the sander is moved over the material, or stationary (fixed), where the material is moved to the sanding belt. Stationary belt sanders are often combined with a disc sander.

Belt sanders can have a very aggressive action on wood and are normally used only for the beginning stages of the sanding process, or used to rapidly remove material.
=== Jig Saw ===
A jigsaw (also called saber saw or saber saw) is a type of saw used for cutting arbitrary curves, such as stenciled designs or other custom shapes, into a piece of wood or similar material. It is usually used in a more artistic fashion than other saws, which only cut in straight lines and exist mainly to chop pieces of wood to length for building structure. The first jigsaw puzzles were made using this kind of saw.

Traditional jigsaws are hand saws, consisting of a handle attached to a small, thin blade. More modern jigsaws are power tools, made up of a motor and a reciprocating saw blade.

=== Miter Saw ===
Today, a miter saw (also called a chop saw or drop saw) usually refers to a power tool used to make a quick, accurate crosscut in a workpiece. It is most frequently used to cut wood, although some plastics and light metals can also be cut with the tool. Common uses include framing operations and the cutting molding. Most miter saws are relatively small and portable, with common blade sizes ranging from eight to 12 inches.

The miter saw makes cuts by pulling a spinning circular saw blade down onto a workpiece in a short, controlled motion. The workpiece is typically held against a fence, which provides a precise cutting angle between the blade and the longest workpiece edge. In standard position, this angle is fixed at 90°.

=== Radial Arm Saw ===
A radial arm saw is a machine intended for cutting materials to length. It is primarily a woodworking machine, although it is sometimes used for cutting metals, such as angle iron or aluminum extrusions. Before the advent of the radial arm saw, table saws and hand saws were most commonly used for crosscutting lumber. Table saws are ideal for ripping stock, but it is awkward to push a long piece of stock widthwise through a table saw blade. When a radial arm saw is used, the stock remains stationary on the saw's table and the blade is pulled through the stock.

=== Router ===
A router is a woodworking tool used to route out (hollow out) an area in the face of a piece of wood. It was a tool particularly used by pattern makers and consisted of a broad-based wooden hand plane with a narrow blade projecting well beyond its base plate. Since about 1960, it has been replaced by the modern spindle router, which was designed for the same work. Further refinement has produced the even more recent plunging spindle router, which is even better adapted for many types of work.

=== Shaper ===
A wood shaper is a stationary woodworking machine in which a spindle spins at moderately high speeds. Specially shaped bits are mounted on the spindle. As the workpiece is fed into the machine, the bit cuts a profile into it. On some shapers, router bits can also be used using a special mounting adapter.

Wood shapers do essentially the same job as the router table, with the main difference being that a wood shaper is a stationary machine designed for larger volume work while a router table is a hand tool for lighter duty work. Routers can also be mounted on a router table, and used as a stationary tool. However, routers run at considerably higher speeds than shapers, and the use of large bits can be dangerous. Also, shapers can be used to cut much larger profiles than routers and custom-made shaper bits can be readily ordered or fabricated.

== 2. Demonstrate how to use the following tools: ==
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Block_plane.jpg|Block Plane
Image:Circ_saw.jpg|Circular Saw
Image:Framing_square.jpg|Framing Square
Image:Hammer2.jpg|Hammer
Image:Crosscut_saw.JPG|Hand saw

Image:Chasse_clou.png|Nail Set
Image:Plumb_bob.jpg|Plumb Bob
Image:Chisel_wood_24mm.jpg|Wood Chisel
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Block Plane ===
A block plane is designed to cut end grain and is typically small enough to be used with one hand.  To use it, securely clamp the piece to be planed to a solid object (ideally, a work bench).  Then pass the plane's sole across the endgrain you are trying to smooth.  The blade can be adjusted, and it is best to set it such that the blade barely protrudes out of the bottom of the plane.  Adjust it so that it takes very thin shavings.  If no wood is removed, let the blade out a little more.

=== Circular Saw (cut a straight line) ===
'''Note: Participants must be at least 16 years old to use power tools'''
It is vitally important that you describe the dangers involved in using a circular saw before you turn your Pathfinders loose on one.  It is very easy to cut off a finger or cause an even more serious injury with one of these.  If your Pathfinders are a little scared (not petrified) of this tool, that's a good thing.  One should ''never'' get too comfortable with dangerous equipment.

Make sure the lumber is well supported before attempting to cut it, and make sure that you closely supervise the use of this tool.  The operator should also wear eye protection.

Adjust the blade so that the depth of cut just exceeds the thickness of the board you wish to cut.  You can run the blade right over the top of a saw horse this way.  This will cut a small groove in the sawhorse, but that's an acceptable use of the tool.

If cutting plywood, you can clamp a piece of lumber along the line so that the shoe of the saw can rest against it and use it as a guide.  Make sure the saw can clear the clamps on ''both'' ends of the cut though.  Also make sure that the operator doesn't have to overreach to complete the cut and that all hands, feet, limbs, small children, and pets are clear of the area.

=== Framing Square ===
A framing square is used to make sure that an angle is 90°.  Place the corner of the square next to the angle you wish to check, and adjust the angle until it lines up with the square.  To check that the square itself is square, mark a straight line and place one edge of the square along this line.  Then mark another line along the other edge of the square, intersecting the first line near the center of its length.  Finally flip the square and see if the other side of the first line and the second line form also a 90° angle.

=== Hammer ===
Grip the hammer near the end of the handle opposite the hammer's head.  Many people grip the handle near the hammer's head, but this is incorrect.  When driving a nail, the hammer must be maneuvered so that its flat face strikes the nail's head at a right angle to the nail's axis, with the head moving parallel to that axis. Failure to achieve either condition will result in a sideways force on the nail's head, that may bend it. Also, one should relax the muscles of the hand and arm momentarily when the hammer strikes.

=== Hand Saw (cut a straight line) ===
Handsaws are tools used for cutting wood. Handsaws come in many varieties, including the crosscut saw, rip saw, coping saw, tenon saw, backsaw, and dovetail saw. Each has its own special use. A crosscut saw is used for cutting across the grain of a piece of lumber. A rip saw is used for cutting along the grain. A coping saw is used for making curved cuts. A tenon saw is used for cutting tenons and other fine work. A backsaw is commonly used with a miter box and for small cutting jobs. A dovetail saw is used for cutting dovetail joints.

To use a crosscut or a rip saw, place the board on a supported surface at thigh-height (between the knee and hips). Grip the saw with the right hand (assuming right-handedness) and use the left knee to hold the board in place. Align the right shoulder, arm, and hand so that they are in line with the cut to be made. Begin with light strokes, noting that the saw cuts on the push stroke. As the cut progresses, keep an eye on the line, pulling the blade toward it. If this is to be a &quot;finished&quot; cut, you can score a &quot;V&quot; along the line first with a carton knife, and let the blade ride in the V groove. Score another line along the bottom of the board to prevent tear-out.

Maintain your saws by keeping them dry and sharp. Many tools (including saws) can be kept in great condition by wiping them down with a cloth and oil (or WD40) after each use.

=== Level ===
A level is a tool designed to indicate whether a surface is level or plumb.  A level surface has no tilt to it, so that liquid would pool up on the surface rather than run off.  A plumb surface is straight up and down.  Ideally, you want your floors to be level and your walls to be plumb.

Most levels have two bubbles on them - one for checking levelness, and the other for checking plumbness.  To use the level, lay its edge on the surface you wish the check.  Embedded in the middle of the level is a small window where the bubble and the tube is mounted. Two rings designate where the bubble would be if the surface were level (or plumb).  If the bubble is not centered between these two rings, the surface is not level.  Lift one edge of the level off the surface to see how far you have to move it in order to move the bubble between the lines.  This will give you an indicator of how much correction is required to make the surface level.  Adjust and remeasure, repeating until the surface is level.

=== Measuring Tape ===
[[image:Ruler_sixteenths.png|left|80px]]
A measuring tape is more commonly known as a &quot;tape measure.&quot;  It is used for measuring the length of an item.  There is a metal tape curled into a spiral inside the enclosure, and attached to a spring.  When the tape is pulled out of the enclosure, the spiral unwinds and the spring is tensed.  When the tape is released, the spring draws it back into the enclosure.  A hook on the end of the tape prevents it from being completely drawn inside, and this hook can also be used for hooking the end of the tape to the edge of a board.  The tape itself is marked with inches, and these can be read off to measure a board or to mark a line for a cut.  Between each inch mark are smaller tick marks.  The largest of these is halfway between each inch marking, and indicates the half-inch measure.  Slightly smaller tick marks lie between the half-inch mark and the inch marks, and these mark off the quarter-inch increments.  Between each of the quarter inch marks are smaller marks to indicate eighths.  Some tapes also mark off sixteenths (sometimes only for the first several inches).  See the illustration to see how to read the markings.

Most tape measures also show 1 foot increments (often with a black square) as well as showing 16-inch increments (often with a red square).  The 16-inch increments are useful because studs, joists, and rafters are commonly 16 inches apart.

=== Nail Set ===
A nail set is used in finish carpentry to drive a nail below the surface of a board.  First the nail is driven with a hammer until it is very near the surface of the board.  Then the tip of the nail set is placed on the nail head.  Finish nails have a small divot in the head to accept the nail set.  The head of the nail set is then struck with the hammer until the nail is driven below (or flush with) the surface of the board.

=== Plumb Bob ===
A plumb bob is a weight on the end of a string.  The weight will hang straight down and is used as a reference for a perfectly vertical line.  It can be used in some places where a level cannot - such as in a place where there is no vertical surface to place the level against.  For example, a carpenter may wish to find a place on the floor just below a point on a ceiling joist so he can construct an interior non-weight bearing wall there and then be able to tie it into the ceiling joist.  In this case, the wall does not yet exist, so there is nothing to place a level against to measure for plumbness.

=== Wood Chisel ===
Wood chisels are most commonly used in carpentry for installing recessed hinges.  To do this, the hinge is laid on the board to which it will be attached, and then it is traced.  The hinge is then removed, and a sharp knife is used to score around the hinge's outline.  A chisel is then used to remove wood to a depth equal to the hinge's thickness.

== 3. Describe the use of and distinguish between the following types of nails: 20 Penny, 16 Penny, 12 Penny, 8 Penny, 6 Penny, Finish, Brad, Roofing, Screw Nail, Sinker, Common, and Galvenized ==

;Penny: The '''penny''' size is written with a number and the abbreviation d for penny (e.g. - 10d). D is an abbreviation for denarius, a Roman coin similar to a penny; this was the abbreviation for a penny in the UK before decimaliation. A smaller number indicates a shorter nail and a larger number indicates a longer nail. Nails under 1-1/4 in., often called brads, are sold mostly in small packages with only a length designation (e.g. 1/2&quot; (12 mm), 1-1/8&quot; (28 mm), etc.).

;Finish nail: A '''finish nail''' is used for interior woodworking.  Size varies, but the head of the nail is only slightly larger than the nail's shaft.  A finish nail is ''set'' by driving its head below the surface of the wood using a ''nail set''.  The head can then be covered with putty (for a natural finish) or with caulk (for a painted finish).  If done well, this makes the nail effectively invisible.

;Brad: '''Brad''' nails are small and often made of brass.  They are often used to hold small pieces of trim in place.  Rather than attempting to hide the nail, brads sometimes have decorative heads, so that the nail head becomes part of the decor.

;Roofing nail: A '''roofing nail''' is short with a large, flat head.  It is also coated with zinc to prevent rusting.  Roofing nails are used for attaching shingles to a roof.

;Screw nail: A '''screw nail''' has a twisted shank for extra holding power.

;Sinker: A '''Sinker''' nail's head is tapered on the underside, so that the nail can be driven flush with the surface of the board.  These are used in general construction.

;Common: A '''Common''' nail has a flat head and is used for general construction, carpentry, and framing.

;Galvanized: A '''Galvanized''' nail is a nail that has been coated with zinc to inhibit corrosion.  Galvanized nails are often used in work that will be exposed to weather.

== 4. Assist in erecting a building not less than 6x8 feet in ground dimensions with a gable roof and at least one door and one window, demonstrating ability to measure and use tools from requirement 2. ==
This requirement is just ''begging'' you to build a shed, though other options are certainly possible as well.  Many Pathfinders go on mission trips to help build churches or schools, and if your group is planning to do this, you have the perfect opportunity to earn this honor.

In the United States (and in most developed countries) the local government will require a building permit for a shed, even one as small as this.  Check with the local government and review the building codes before starting this project.  They will usually want a drawing showing what you plan to build before issuing a permit.

If building a small shed, you may be able to use a &quot;floating&quot; foundation - that is special concrete blocks in the shape of a trapezoid (wider at the base than on top).  The blocks sit on the ground, and beams are placed in notches on top of these.  The floor joists and headers (which join to the end of the joists) are built on top of the beams.  Once the floor is built, the walls can be framed (including openings for the doors and windows).  At this point, the walls can be sheathed and the roof can be framed, sheathed, and shingled as well.  Then the doors and windows are installed, the siding is put on, and the finish carpentry begins on the inside (though this step can be skipped on a shed).

Be sure that your Pathfinders each use all the tools called out in requirement 2.  It might be a good idea to make a checklist for each Pathfinder, and have them compare their activities to it as the day progresses to be sure they use all the tools required.

== 5. When building the above project, use all of these features: ==
[[Image:Carpentry_construction_details.png|thumb|500px|right|1:cap plate, 2:top plate, 3:cripple stud, 4:header, 5:stud, 6:shoe plate, 7:jack stud, 8:subfloor, 9:joist.]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
=== Floor Joist ===
A floor joist is a board that supports the floor.  Depending on how large an area the floor covers, and how far the joists span, the floor joist can be anywhere from a 2x6 to a 2x12, or even bigger.  Floor joists are installed edgewise, and they are attached to headers which attach to the foundation of the building.

=== Sub Floor ===
The sub floor is usually made from plywood, particle board, or oriented strand board (OSB), and is nailed (or screwed) to the floor joists.  The finished floor (carpeting, hardwood floor, laminate floor, linoleum, vinyl, tile, etc.) is then laid atop the sub floor.

=== Shoe Plate ===
More commonly known as a bottom plate or a sole plate, a shoe plate is the bottom board in a framed wall.  Studs are nailed into this board, and it is nailed to the floor.  Some local building codes require that the shoe plate be made of pressure treated lumber to resist rot if water pools on the floor (for whatever reason).

=== Top Plate ===
The top plate is the board running along the top of a framed wall.  Like the shoe plate, the studs are nailed to this board, and it is attached to the ceiling.

=== Double Plate ===
For added strength, two top plates are used, most commonly on a weight-bearing wall.  The upper top plate is called the cap plate.

=== Conventional Roof or Trusses ===
A ''conventional roof'' is made from rafters which are beams that run from the roof's ridge to the ceiling joists.  A ''truss'' is an engineered, pre-built structure consisting of triangles.  Trusses are lighter, stronger, and cheaper than rafters, but they form a web of lumber inside the roof rendering the attic space unusable.  Rafters are positioned in line with the studs in a wall and are fastened to both the top plate and the ceiling joists.  A pair of rafters (joined to the opposite sides of the ridge board) are sometimes tied together with a collar beam which is a horizontal member.

=== Felt Roof ===
Felt roofing material is not like the felt sets used in the children's Sabbath School classes.  Rather, &quot;felt roofing&quot; is just another name for tar paper.  Before installing the felt roofing, you should first nail a drip strip to the edges of the roof.  Then the felt paper is rolled out over the entire horizontal length of the roof (not top to bottom!) and stapled onto the sheathing.  If the felt is not wide enough to cover the roof from the eaves to the peak, you will need another layer.  The first layer should be along the eaves, and subsequent layers should overlap previous ones by a couple of inches.  If the roof has a ridge vent, do '''not''' cover it.  The purpose if a ridge vent is to allow heat to escape from the attic.  Covering it with tar paper defeats this feature completely.  The roof is now ready to shingle.

=== Shingles ===
Shingles are laid on top of the felt roofing, starting with the bottom row.  Use roofing nails to attach asphalt shingles directly to the felt roofing.  The next row of shingles should be offset from the first so that the boundary between two shingles and the notches that make up the tabs in one shingle are completely covered by the tab of another - not by another boundary or by a notch.  The shingles should overlap such that only the tabs show, and not the solid portion on the upper part of the shingle.  It helps tremendously to mark parallel lines on the tar paper with a chalk line so that the shingles do not creep uphill.  You want the line to be level.

=== Window with Weight-bearing Header ===
A window opening must have a weight-bearing header.  The header is a pair of 2x4's which are turned on their edges and nailed to a stud.  A pair of studs (called ''jack studs'') run from the bottom of the header to the floor to help support the weight.  Short studs (called ''cripple studs'' then run from the header to the top plate.  The cripple studs supply a support for the wall's sheeting.

=== Door with Weight-bearing Header ===
As with windows, doors also require a weight-bearing header.  It is built exactly the same way a window opening is made.
=== Fascia on Eaves ===
Fascia is a &quot;finish&quot; board that covers the ends of the rafters.

=== Siding ===
The purpose of siding is to keep water out of the building.  Vinyl siding is, in general, easier to work with than aluminum siding, but there are other options too, including asphalt, weather boards, and plain old plywood with felt paper beneath and with furring strips covering the joints.

==Note==
Participants must be 16 years old or older to use power tools.

The latest bulletin is a year old.  Perhaps this page should be discontinued?  At least it should not be linked from the main wikibooks page [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 04:52, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

:There are a number of &quot;current news&quot; items that could potentially go up here, but for somebody willing to volunteer to keep this page up to date.  Indeed, Wikibooks has been in the news quite a bit lately from a number of different places.  In particular, the French newspaper '''Liberation''' just did a [http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=332875 major article] on Wikijunior and Wikibooks.... surprisingly talking quite a bit about the English Wikibooks in addition to the French port of the project.  The numbers are a little off because they claim a total of 12,000 titles, when in fact that is the module count.  Title count on Wikibooks is in the range of a few hundred, but it is still impressive when you think about it.

:Ideally, this should be updated.  For now, this is historical information about the origins of Wikibooks and some early press coverage.  I don't see a reason to delete this page, but perhaps a disclaimer that this is heavily out of date and that we need a volunteer to add updated news regarding Wikibooks.  The 10,000th Wikibook module went by with little fanfare except for a brief mention at meta and the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]].  As far as linking from the main page is concerned, I don't see too much problem with that but perhaps it could be moved to the Community Portal page instead?  That is another page which is in dire need of updating as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:03, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::Are there any good places within the community to get some news (e.g. the 10,000 module).  Like is the Mailing list a good place?
::Also is this page not better named as &quot;News&quot; then?  I thought it would be a kind of forum [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 13:28, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
:::I personally wouldn't object to this page being renamed &quot;news&quot; instead of Bulletin Board.  Wikipedia has a &quot;news&quot; section, and Quarto is the overall Wikimedia &quot;news&quot; publication (and of course there is Wikinews for general news as well).  We just havn't been too organized in this regard.  Surprisingly, Google News is perhaps the best bet right now to find out what people outside of this project are saying about us.  The mailing list is a joke and mainly a bunch of early contributors to Wikibooks.  It is, however, a good way to get quick communication to the Wikimedia Foundation board regarding Wikibooks activities.  [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] is a much better forum for general communications within Wikibooks, but even that doesn't always get monitored.  Better than most places, however.  If you are willing to &quot;volunteer&quot; and turn this into a general news area about current happenings with Wikibooks, I would like to encourage you to do that.  Some exciting things are happening with Wikibooks, and it would be nice to be able to point out major accomplishments when they occur.  I just don't have the time to do all the organization I know it will take to rework this page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:28, 25 October 2005 (UTC)


::: Without promising too much I will try and make the page a little more current, and perhaps even rename it when I figure how to.  I have high hopes for wikibooks and do not like seeing it look like it is dormant.  [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 23:41, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::::Thanks for the effort so far.  You are correct, we need to keep pages like this fresh.  One of the problems with Wikibooks is that most contributors here tend to hunker down and work on their little pet Wikibook, which takes quite a bit of time to flesh out.  In contrast, Wikipedia can typically get a major article completed quickly, not only because those articles are shorter but there are usually more contributors willing to help.  After adding a half dozen articles, many people are willing to branch out and work on &quot;website infrastructure&quot; like links between pages and content organization.  The process of doing that here on Wikibooks, like just about everything else, tends to take quite a bit longer to happen.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:21, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

== Dead? ==

Does any one watch this page? I posted some practical news here and don't even know if anyone reads them...

Tip for everyone: you can post here '''everything''' that has project-wide meaning: request for adminship, new CSS class, change in important template etc. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 07:39, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

:I'm watching this page... mainly for vandalism.  Still, it would be nice to add a little bit more &quot;news&quot;.  I don't have the time to keep this current, but it would be nice to make some project-wide happenings put here as a brief note of what is going on.  It looks like more is happening off the Staff Lounge page more and more, so this might become a useful place to keep a quick eye on what is happening on Wikibooks before you discover that decisions have been made without you.  The community portal page needs similar work.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:27, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

::We've been trying hard to resurrect this page, and hopefully people will be adding more news to it as time goes on. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:01, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

:::How does this page differ from other pages like the Staff Room, Admins' Noticeboard, etc.?  I'm watching this page also but I don't know why.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:58, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: Staff Lounge is an active discussion forum. Bulletin board is more of a 1-line or 2-line summary of an important event. I didn't know this page existed for a while, but now I watch it. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 15:41, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:::::Xania probably doesnt need to watch it, because he's already involved in all the discussions. The bulletin board is just a place to share news to users, and if you already know all the news, you don't need to watch it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:15, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

::::::I was going to ask 'but how do people find this page?' but then I noticed that it's linked from the sidebar.  Maybe it should be called 'Wikibooks News' or something that calls out for people to read it.  'Bulletin board' just suggests it's some kind of forum and so won't be visited by many users. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:::::::Perhaps we should rename the link to be &quot;Bulletin board|Wikibooks News&quot;, or something like that, but I dont think we should rename this page entirely. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

== RSS feed ==

It'd be really nice to have an RSS feed for this. We could easily have a RC bot check for additions to the project page and upload data to be added to an existing rss and atom file. I could create the php backend, except that I know little about protecting the files from hijackers, so probably not. I doubt the rcbot would be too difficult to create. Who has an always-on server (at their home, I assume) they're willing to host it on? Since it would only be text, anyone one of the major editors getting a free hosting service would probably be sufficient. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 18:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

:I don't currently an always-on server, but I have been planning to create one sometime soon. I have a server machine (PII, Redhat linux, Apache), but it isn't connected. What I need to do is boot up my server, update all the old software, register a domain name, and set up some bot software to run on it. But you are right, some kind of feed for the bulletin board would be nice. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:01, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Mediawiki has an RSS feed for every page. Go to &quot;history&quot; and it appears in toolbox. The one for this (talk) page is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Bulletin_board&amp;action=history&amp;feed=rss here]... lol. The one for this page itself is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Bulletin_board&amp;action=history&amp;feed=rss here] --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:58, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Regardless, I dont think this page changes nearly enough to warrant a different RSS feed. It would be a very boring feed indeed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:54, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

==Creation of a math formulas page==
I think that it would be a great asset for anyone in the math field if there was a site where a majority of the formulas could be found. This was suggested by the people at wikipedia.      from: trd89 @ wikipedia March 2, 2007
: Isn't that already the function of [[w:Table of integrals]], [[w:Table of derivatives]], et. al.? --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:16, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

::The [[Calculus]] book contains a few pages with such lists, and there is another similar work at [[Engineering Tables]], which serves as a shared &quot;appendix&quot; for a number of other books on the engineering bookshelf. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:10, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

== Needed? ==

The old discussion is being reincarnated.  Is this page really necessary?  Yes, I visit it and it's on my watch list but is it really necessary?  There are so many pages for general discussion - assistance, Bulletin Board, Technical, General discussion, Project discussion, etc.  Given that this is a small wiki do we need so many?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:56, 5 November 2009 (UTC)

Also given what I've just said, was it wise for me to even bother posting my comment here?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:56, 5 November 2009 (UTC)

:It's on my WL too, but I don't think anyone ever comes here (well... how would I know?)  It's certainly not serving its intended purpose, and as you note, other pages seem to be filling that role just fine. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:55, 5 November 2009 (UTC)

:News postings ought to have a place on the main page, if anywhere, for visibility, but there's not enough involvement to discuss redesigning it.  We're still doing better than [[v:Wikiversity:News|Wikiversity:News]], but there's not enough activity to justify this page.  If not deleted entirely, I suggest that this page and [[User:WikimediaNotifier/notifications]] be removed from [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Navigation]] and this page be removed from the navigation at left, to put the focus on pages that more of the community is actively watching, if not actively involved in.  This page in particular is the first link in the navigation under the community heading and creates the terrible impression that this wiki is dead. 

:For that matter, [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks in the media]] linked from the unimpressive [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]] hasn't been updated since 2007 either.  Let's clean up the cobwebs and get rid of these. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:52, 17 November 2009 (UTC)

: This isn't intended to be a discussion page, rather news about Wikibooks that Wikibookians consider to be of importance so that people who have been gone awhile have a place to turn to learn what importance things have happened. This includes things like when a proposal becomes a policy, if new extensions become enabled, etc. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:20, 24 November 2009 (UTC)

== RfC notice ==

Thanks to Uncle G for [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Bulletin_Board&amp;diff=2370660&amp;oldid=2312939 informing] people about the Internet Defense League RfC. Just a quick remark that it is not true that &quot;Unfortunately, the Foundation representatives only directly notified that part of the community that is on the English Wikipedia&quot; - this was [http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/foundation/282112 posted] on Wikimedia-l (formerly Foundation-l), quite the usual venue for such issues, and [[m:Wikimedia_Forum#RfC_on_the_Internet_Defense_League|on the &quot;Wikimedia Forum&quot;]] on Meta.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Two provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA or Act) sought to protect minors from harmful material on the Internet. 47 U.S.C. §223(a)(1)(B)(ii) criminalized the &quot;knowing&quot; transmission of &quot;obscene or indecent&quot; messages to any recipient under 18 years of age. Section 223(d) prohibits the &quot;knowin[g]&quot; sending or displaying to a person under 18 of any message &quot;that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.&quot; 

Affirmative defenses are provided for those who take &quot;good faith, . . . effective . . . actions&quot; to restrict access by minors to the prohibited communications, §223(e)(5)(A), and those who restrict such access by requiring certain designated forms of age proof, such as a verified credit card or an adult identification number, §223(e)(5)(B). A number of plaintiffs filed suit challenging the constitutionality of §§223(a)(1) and 223(d). 

In ACLU v. Reno, after making extensive findings of fact, a three-judge District Court convened pursuant to the Act entered a preliminary injunction against enforcement of both challenged provisions. The court's judgment enjoined the Government from enforcing §223(a)(1)(B)'s prohibitions insofar as they relate to &quot;indecent&quot; communications, but expressly preserves the Government's right to investigate and prosecute the obscenity or child pornography activities prohibited therein. The injunction against enforcement of §223(d) was unqualified because that section contains no separate reference to obscenity or child pornography. The Government appealed to the Supreme Court under the Act's special review provisions, arguing that the District Court erred in holding that the CDA violated both the First Amendment because it is over-broad and the Fifth Amendment because it is vague. The Supreme Court held that the CDA's &quot;indecent transmission&quot; and &quot;patently offensive display&quot; provisions violated the First Amendment.

      <comment>/* Potential dividers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A direct current (DC) circuit usually has a steady and constant voltage supplied to it. A direct current does not have a continually changing polarity, unlike an alternating current (AC), but instead a constant direction and rate of flow. DC is generally provided by batteries or via a transformer, rather than generators. 

==Circuit diagrams==

Below are the symbols and names for all of the components that you are required to know:

[[Image:Circuit_Symbols_for_A-level-OCR-Physics_A.png|center|600px]]
==Series circuits==
When resistors are set up in series, the formula to work out the total resistance is: &lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R_T = r_1+r_2+r_n...etc&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2&lt;/math&gt; etc., are the resistance of each resistor in series.

==Parallel circuits==
When resistors are set up in parallel, the formula to work out the total resistance is: &lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r_t}=\frac{1}{r_1}+\frac{1}{r_2}+\frac{1}{r_n} ...etc&lt;/math&gt; 

Where &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2&lt;/math&gt; etc., are the resistance of each resistor in parallel.

==Internal resistance==
A electrical source has its own resistance, known as '''Internal Resistance'''. This is caused by the electrons in the source having to flow through wires within it, or in the case of a chemical battery, the charge may have to flow through the electrolytes and electrodes that make up the cell.

By considering a battery of EMF E, in series with a resistor of resistance R we can calculate the internal resistance r:

&lt;math&gt;E=I(R+r)&lt;/math&gt;      (See Series Circuits above)

Combining with V=IR:

&lt;math&gt;V=E-Ir&lt;/math&gt; 

The quantity Ir is called the '''lost volts'''. The lost volts shows us the energy transferred to the internal resistance of the source, so if you short circuit a battery, I is very high and the battery gets warm.

==Potential dividers==
A potential (or voltage) divider is made up of two resistors. The output voltage from a potential divider will be a proportion of the input voltage and is determined by the resistor values.

The values of a battery with voltage V1 passing through two resistors in series of resistance R1 and R2, with an output circuit in parallel with Resistor R1 with output voltage V2 are related by the equation:
&lt;math&gt;V1=(R1/(R1+R2))&lt;/math&gt; × &lt;math&gt;V2&lt;/math&gt;

==Kirchhoff's laws==

First Law states &quot;The sum of the current (A) entering a junction is equal to the sum of the current (A) leaving the junction&quot;.
This is a consequence of conservation of charge.


Second law states that the EMF is equal to the voltage of the circuit. This is a consequence of conservation of energy.

==Use of other components==
Thermistors can be placed in circuits when temperature plays a role. As the temperature increases, the resistance of the device decreases. This does not obey the Ohms law. Light dependent resistors are resistors that decrease their resistance when exposed to light.

==Introduction==

This book will eventually cover a large number of topics in the field of electrical communications. The reader will also require a knowledge of Time and Frequency Domain representations, which is covered in-depth in the [[Signals and Systems]] book. This book will, by necessity, touch on a number of different areas of study, and as such is more than just a text for aspiring Electrical Engineers. This book will discuss topics of analog communication schemes, computer programming, network architectures, information infrastructures, communications circuit analysis, and many other topics. 

''This book is still in an early stage of development. Many topics do not yet have pages, and many of the current pages are stubs. Any help would be greatly appreciated.''

{{warning|Several pages from this book have been moved to [[Communication Networks]] and [[Data Coding Theory]]. If you are looking for a page that seems to have disappeared, check in these places.}}

__NOTOC__
With the explosion of digital communications and digital media, the need for methods to process digital data is more important than ever. This book will begin with a look at the mathematical concepts behind digital processing, then will build on that with particular algorithms to do the work, and finally will present the actual implementations of these techniques in today's hardware and software systems. Many real-world algorithms are based on the techniques described in this book. JPEG images, MP3 songs, MPEG-2 videos, and ZIP files are all processed using digital processing techniques, and all of them will be discussed, at least conceptually. This book will not teach programming, and will probably not even provide much in the way of actual code, so we don't need to worry much about computer language dependence, except where otherwise noted. For some solid background information on the various mathematical theories in this book, consider reading [[Signals and Systems]].

''This book is in a very early stage of production, and many of the pages either don't exist or only exist as bare stubs. Help and contributions from all wikibookians will be very much appreciated!''

== Preface ==

{{wikipedia|Embedded system}}
{{Wikiversity|Embedded System Engineering}}

This book is about microcontrollers, in the field of digital control systems. We will discuss embedded systems, real-time operating systems, and other topics of interest. It is important to realize that embedded systems rarely have display capabilities, and if they do have displays, they are usually limited to small text-only LCD displays. The challenge of programming an embedded system then is that it is difficult to get real-time feedback from the system without a display. It is common to use a simple serial interface for diagnostic purposes, for example by connecting to a PC running terminal software via a RS-232 to USB adapter.  Also, embedded systems usually have very strict memory limitations, processor limitations, and speed limitations that must play a factor in designing an embedded system, and programming an embedded computer. This book talks about some of the specific issues involved in programming an embedded computer. It also covers some basic topics such as microprocessor architectures, FPGAs, and some general low-level computing topics. While many of the issues discussed in this book may apply to PCs, and non-embedded computers, this book remains focused on topics that apply to embedded systems only.

This book has incorporated a number of smaller books, stub-books, and half-books that were previously written about this subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
The Georgia Water Council, as sequel to the [[../External Links/Organizations/Georgia Water Resources Council|Georgia Water Resources Council]], was created by the [[../Laws/Georgia Comprehensive State-wide Water Management Planning Act|Comprehensive State-wide Water Management Planning Act]], from [http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2003_04/fulltext/hb237.htm HB237], signed by Governor Sonny Perdue on May 13, 2004.[http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org]
This Act is based on the work of the [[../External Links/Organizations/Georgia Joint Comprehensive Water Plan Study Committee|Joint Comprehensive Water Plan Study Committee]] of 2001-2002.  It replaced the [[../Policy/Georgia River Basin Management Planning Act|River Basin Management Planning Act]] of 1992.

==Duties==
Duties of the Georgia Water Council as specified in the Act ([http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-5-524 OCGA 12-5-524](b)) include:
# Ensure coordination, cooperation, and communication among state agencies and their water related efforts in the development of a comprehensive state-wide water management plan;
# Provide input to the [[../External Links/Organizations/Georgia Environmental Protection Division|Georgia EPD]] concerning the development of a comprehensive state-wide water management plan;
# Review, modify if necessary, and approve the final draft of the proposed comprehensive state-wide water management plan; and
# Recommend such initial proposed plan for consideration by the General Assembly not later than ... the first day of the 2008 regular session of the General Assembly.

==Members==

==Accountancy==

I just spent a bit of time commenting on your proposed organization of the Introduction to Accounting (or just Accountancy) book, and then I noticed that you had done it almost four years ago.  I'm just curious.  Have you abandoned this project?

I'm also curious as to your background.  A book on accounting?  Another book on Cellular Automata?  This sounds a lot like my background.  (I double degreed while I was in college, with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.B.A. in Accounting.  I then went on in Accounting with a M.Acc., a CPA, CMA, and am currently in the Fiscal Services Department of a local government.)  But this is purely curiousity on my part.  Feel free to ignore this question if you think it's too personal, or just delete it. --[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:56, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

== I acted on the merge and removed the [[Complex Analysis Handbook]] RfD ==
I acted on the merge request (not opposed) and removed your RfD. Since there is no need for archival or to establish a special closing of the RfD the only avenue was to remove the request itself. Feel free to edit the changes to [[Complex Analysis]].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:22, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
:Unless the proponent of the RfD objects, I see no need to restore the RfD (though if there ''is'' an objection, it definitely gets restored).  Panic&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; for future reference, cutting the [[w:Gordian knot|Gordian knot]] by unilaterally removing someone else's RfD could go badly wrong if it were taken amiss, and there ''is'' (on reflection) an alternative that would fall safely within procedure, and get the job done: do the merge, and add a comment to the RfD saying you've done it.  The nominator has the opportunity to respond within the process, and if they agree, the RfD can simply be closed.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:28, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
::Yes I considered using the comment option, but decided that if any brouhaha would happen it would be reduced to those implicated and not extend to the rest of the community since at least I'm confident that two of us will be able to rapidly resolve any issue I selected the option that could create less distraction to the rest of the community. If Xerol objects to my action of course I will agree that the removal of the RfD should be undone and we will discuss it further there.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
::In any case we should think about a solution to this cases, IIRC this is the second time I've aborted one RfD using the same method but as you state it can be a cause of conflict (depending on those involved) since most abortable RfD originate in users with less experience and because of that more probable to escalate the issue. The action is made safe under BeBold, putting the issue of removing signed posts.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:53, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
:::Perform a non-admin closure and leave it up for a week.  It can then be archived. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:41, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
{{outdent|:::}} For the record the actual merge done borders on vandalism.  It appears to be a blind copy and paste of material from one book into the other with disregard of the content written in the page and elsewhere in the book, style, notation, etc.  Now the page on the derivative defines the derivative twice ''in the same module''.  Derives the Cauchy Riemann equations, in two consecutive modules and duplicates much of the material.  And material from the introduction of the book now appears as if for the first time at the beginning of Chapter 2.  I just don't understand why such the rushed job?  Why not look over the new book a little first? I will take a little time and see what I can do about cleaning it up. But I really wish you hadn't done the merge in the first place, it would have been easier to get right the first time. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 20:38, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
:Calling vandalism is a bit too harsh Thenub314, nothing was destroyed and people can improve on what is there. I refrained of doing any &lt;u&gt;reshuffling&lt;/u&gt; and complied with the non objected proposals for merge (the claim that I increased complexity is also unfounded), even Xerol clearly noted that some content was usable so I simply removed the need to put the process of salvage in the hands on the general community to the people that really are interested in working on it. Since Xerol RfD did spur interest in the content something constructive may result (I also did contact the Wikibooians working on the books and the original merge tagger). It was not a blind copy but also nothing more than a merge of related content. In any case it's best to discuss what to salvage that what to delete, it also may create a chance for you to add to it.
:I think that it would be more constructive to do what you see as needed changes in place of making hash judgments. I'll gladly appreciate any help you can provide in improving it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:52, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
::Basically I RfD'd it because I wanted to spur a bit of discussion, not being familiar with the topic, amongst those who could properly merge the material. I only noticed the page to begin with as part of my [[User:Xerol/Cleanup|war on orphans]], saw the merge notice, checked page histories, saw that a few constructive edits ''had'' been made since the merge notice was put up, looked at the merge target book, and then went to RfD to get comments. I even mentioned in the RfD that it seemed like the content could not be readily merged into the other book, simply because the writing styles were very different, and also mentioned that I only had limited knowledge on the topic, which I intended as a clue that someone more knowledgeable should take a look at it and inform the decision. Where did I &quot;clearly note that some content was usable&quot;? I said there wasn't much that could be merged that would add anything to the larger, more developed book. ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion&amp;oldid=1885510#Complex_Analysis_Handbook_and_subpages Original edit here])
::I know that no one really &quot;owns&quot; a book but in nearly every case of dealing with subject matter with which I was unfamiliar I've elected to notify those who seem to be the primary editors on a book that action should be taken. In this case, had I not decided to put it up for an RfD (for instance, if there had been a lot of meaningful material that didn't appear in the other book, but the stubbier book was clearly still incomplete and completely inactive) I would've at the very least replaced the {{tl|mergefrom}} notice (which appears to never have been placed to begin with; the history merge makes it very confusing though), and at least left a note on the TOC's talk page plus any user talk pages as appropriate. If nothing had been done about it within a week or so I might've acted on my own (or, in this case, asked a friend with 2 master's degrees in math). Basically there's a lot of ways to do what was done, and the way this was handled seems like one of the worse ways to do it. But, looking through the pages with my limited knowledge, there was value added to the post-merge pages so it's not like a ridiculously egregious act was committed here. Lines may have been crossed but it all worked out in the end, so let's all learn some lessons and move on. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 23:53, 11 July 2010 (UTC)

:::I take that we are all done on this subject. I have been talking with Thenub314 and I assure you if anyone can have any blame here is me for being unable to predict this storm in a teacup. Sorry about the use of your talkpage but since you were the proponent of the RfD it seems unavoidable. Since you demonstrated interest on that content now merged I inform you that of the 70 lines of text on the original 3 pages, soon after the merge, only ~10 lines remain.
:::In regard to the BeBold I urge you to take on your own words and proceed in updating the manual of stile. I'm having a &quot;soft&quot; dispute regarding necessary distinction we need to make on the C++ Programming book as a requirement to inform readers on the version that is covered (C++0x is almost out and some information is already being put on the book). It would be nice to point to an accepted the text even if not a guideline to establish common ground.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:15, 13 July 2010 (UTC)
::::I need to clean up the text a bit (writing in an instructional/informative tone is something I have difficulty with) but I can put up an abridged version for now and add to it. There is a consensus that it should be added, so it'll get in there sooner or later, just probably a bit later as the MOS is something that I feel requires a little more carefulness than boldness. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 06:20, 13 July 2010 (UTC)

== Template ==
It would be useful also to cover &quot;also covers&quot; (if the information is mixed together) and &quot;the next version&quot; (even if it isn't a direct improvement it would be easier to search for the template after the release and fix it).  Just some thoughts based on what would be required on the C++ Programming book (see [[w:C++0x|C++0x]]), and due to some changes need to be covered next to existing &quot;old version&quot; content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:16, 13 July 2010 (UTC)
:You can put any text you want as the SoftwareVersion parameter, for example you could say &quot;0.47 and newer&quot;. DeprecationType probably isn't the best name for that parameter, but if you wanted a separate designation for &quot;Unreleased&quot; or &quot;Future&quot; it could be added.

If the aircraft were set to fly a particular ground track, the aircraft would not be blown off course by wind. The aircraft's ground speed would also be equal to its true airspeed, but as we have seen, this is not usually the case. The one element that affects ground speed and track is the effects of wind.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|bc programming language}}
'''bc''' is an arbitrary-precision calculator language. The ''arbitrary-precision'' means that numbers can contain unlimited digits (limited by memory); most other languages limit numbers to eight bytes at most. For addition, subtraction, and multiplication, there is unlimited precision. Division stops after a certain number of decimal places (usually 0 or 20), so &quot;bc&quot; is often bad with very small numbers (like 10e-44).

&quot;bc&quot; is often called using the &quot;-l&quot; option, which loads the standard library (which mostly contains trig functions) and sets the number of decimal places for division to 20. (Doing trig with the default precision of 0 decimal places is not so useful.)
==Example session==
This is an example of a user starting bc, doing two calculations, and exiting with &quot;quit&quot;. Note that pressing '''^D''' (control-D) also exits.

 $ '''bc -l'''
 '''3 + 4'''
 7
 '''2 / 5'''
 .40000000000000000000
 '''quit'''
 $

==Example script==
{{warning|Some versions of &quot;bc&quot; limit function and variable names to one letter. The following example has long function and variable names and must be changed to work on these copies of &quot;bc&quot;.

The following example was tested with OpenBSD bc and has also been verified with Gnu bc version 1.06 patchlevel 2.}}

This script implements [[w:Simpson's rule|Simpson's rule]] for integration. The function &quot;integrate&quot; approximates the definite integral from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;b&quot; using &quot;n&quot; parabola sections. The formula for &quot;simpson&quot; is taken from [[w:Simpson's rule|the Wikipedia article]]. This example integrates the sine function, but different functions can be used by replacing f.

 define f(x) {
   return s(x);
 }
 
 define simpson(a,b) {
   return ( (b-a)/6 ) * ( f(a) + 4*f((a+b)/2) + f(b) );
 }
 
 define integrate(a,b,n) {
   delta = (b - a) / n;
   result = 0;
 
   for(i = a; (n = n - 1) + 1; i = i + delta) {
     /*print &quot;calling simpson(&quot;, i, &quot;, &quot;, i + delta, &quot;) with n = &quot;, n, &quot;\n&quot;;*/
     result = result + simpson(i, i + delta);
   }
   return result;
 }

Put this in a file, say &quot;simpson&quot;, load it, and integrate f from 0 to pi (pi is &quot;4*a(1)&quot;, 4 times arctangent of 1) with 100 intervals:
 $ '''bc -l simpson'''
 '''integrate(0, 4*a(1), 100)'''
 2.00000000067647189101
 '''^D'''

Explanation : 
Now explain these features so users can understand the script.
*variables and statements
*&quot;for&quot; loops
*functions (&quot;define&quot; and &quot;return&quot;)
*standard library functions (&quot;s&quot; is sine)

==Basic operations==

===Conversions===
First check default values of base for input ( ibase) and output ( obase) numbers : 

 ibase
 10
 obase
 10

Note that  obase and ibase are special variables which define output and input base. Obase values range from 2 to 999 and ibase values range from 2 to 16. 

Then one can convert the number 12 from base 10 to base 2:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basicallytech.com/blog/?/archives/23-command-line-calculations-using-bc.html command-line calculations using bc by  Rob Newcater]&lt;/ref&gt;

 $ echo 'obase=2;12' | bc

and the result is :

==1. Tell how the following processes are related to lumber and how each process is done: ==
=== Growing Trees ===
Lumber comes from trees, so in order to get lumber, a tree must be cut down.  Before a tree can be cut down, it must be grown.  Many areas are managed forests, where once the trees have been harvested for lumber, new trees are planted to take their place.  Doing so make lumber a sustainable resource.  The science of growing trees is called forestry.

=== Harvesting of Trees ===
Harvesting of trees is the practice of cutting them down in order to convert them into lumber.  There are several approaches to this, including clear cutting and selective cutting.

When a forest is clear cut, all woody plants are removed.  The larger ones are cut into 16' sections and used for making lumber.  Contrary to popular belief, clear cutting can actually be beneficial to the forest, as it simulates the effect of a natural forest fire.  The trees that are planted in the clear cut will receive more light, and thus produce more lumber more quickly.  However, the clear cut should be replanted with the same species of trees that were harvested from the area.  Clear cutting is often done during a season on several small tracts of land in a larger forest.  This staggers the harvest so that it can be more easily sustained over long periods of time.  

Selective cutting is the practice of only removing mature trees from a forest.  This has a lesser impact on the forest, but it takes longer to produce lumber and it is more labor intensive than clear cutting.  Selective cutting preserves other aspects of the forest though, including its beauty, and its role as a wildlife habitat.

=== Milling ===
Milling lumber is the process of sawing logs into boards.  This is usually done at a saw mill.  There are many ways to cut a log into boards, and the method chosen affects the quality of the lumber and the amount of lumber that can be obtained from the log.  Quarter sawing produces the highest quality lumber, but it does not produce as much lumber as other methods (such as flat sawing).  In quartersawn lumber, the log is first divided into quarters, and then each plank is sawn from that such that the growth rings go through the plank perpendicular to the plank's face.

[[Image:Quartersawn.png|300px|Quartersawn Lumber]]

In flat sawn lumber, All the cuts are made in the same direction.  Thus, the growth rings penetrate the board at many different angles.  This method of cutting produces the most lumber from a log, but that lumber will be far more susceptible to warping and cupping.

[[Image:Flatsawn.png|320px|Flatsawn Lumber]]

=== Curing/Seasoning ===
Curing and Seasoning lumber are two words for the same process.  It is the process of drying lumber after it has been milled.  When timber is first cut, over 50% of its weight is water.  As the lumber dries, it changes shape.  If it is dried unevenly, it will warp, twist, and crack (cracking is also called &quot;checking&quot;).  This is because as the lumber dries, it shrinks.  If it dries unevenly, it will also shrink unevenly.  To season lumber, it must be allowed to dry evenly.  There are several ways to accomplish this, but the two most common are air drying and kiln drying.  After the lumber is milled into rough boards, it is stacked horizontally in layers.  Each layer is separated by &quot;stickers&quot; which are small pieces of wood about an inch thick, an inch or two wide, and as long as the stack is deep.  Stickers are placed on the floor first, and the first layer of lumber is stacked on top of it.  More stickers are placed on top of the first layer directly above the stickers on the floor, and another layer of lumber is placed on them.  This is repeated until there is a large stack of lumber.  Separating the lumber like this allows air to circulate evenly, and thus, the lumber will dry evenly.  Kiln dried lumber is stacked in a kiln (a type of oven) in the same way as air dried lumber.

=== Grading ===
The quality of lumber is widely variable.  The difference between the wood suitable for making shipping crates and pallets and the wood suitable for making furniture and toys is fairly large.  Grading lumber is the process of assigning a quality figure to it - not unlike grading a school paper or a test.  Lumber is graded based on the poorest side of the lumber, and on the yield the lumber is expected to produce (that is, how much of the wood can be converted into boards verses how much will be thrown away).

There are four basic grades of lumber, and even these grades have sub-categories.  The basic grades are listed here from the highest quality to the lowest quality:

'''FAS ''' is short for &quot;'''F'''irsts '''a'''nd '''S'''econds.&quot;  Lumber of this grade is at least 83% clear (free from all defects such as stains, splits, worm holes, knots, etc.) on its poor side.

'''No. 1 Common''' is the next grade of lumber.  It is often used in furniture making.  It must be 67% clear on its poor side.

'''No. 2 Common''' must be at least 50% clear on its poor side.  It is often used in cabinet making and in millwork (molding, baseboards, and other trim).  This grade of lumber is excellent in applications that will be finished with paint (as opposed to a natural finish).

'''No. 3 Common''' is the lowest grade of lumber.  There are two sub-categories called 3A and 3B.  3A must be at least 33% clear, while 3B must be at least 25% sound (rather than clear).  3A is often used for flooring, while 3B often used for making pallets and crates.

Hardwood Lumber Grading]

=== Sizing ===
Once lumber has been milled and cured, it is sized.  There are three common methods of sizing lumber.  The first and most common is dimensional.  The most well known of the dimensional sizes is the 2 by 4 (2x4).  Other sizes include the 2x6, 2x8, 4x4, etc.  Before a 2x4 is sized, it is 2 inches thick and 4 inches wide.  The lumber is then planed so that the edges are smooth and the thickness is even.  The planing process removes about a half inch of lumber, so the finished 2x4 is really 1.5 inches thick by 3.5 inches wide.  It is still called a 2x4 though, because that's much easier than calling it a 1.5 x 3.5.

The second sizing method is known as quartering.  Rough sawn lumber is sized in quarter inch increments.  A one inch thick, rough sawn plank is called four-quarter, and this is written as 4/4.  Rough sawn lumber is also available in 5/4, 8/4, and 10/4 sizes.  These are 1.25&quot;, 2&quot;, and 2.5&quot; thick respectively.

The third sizing method is the board foot method.  A board foot of lumber is one inch thick, 12 inches wide, and 12 inches long.  In other words, a board foot of lumber contains 144 cubic inches of wood.  Even if the plank is not 12 inches wide or one inch thick, it is still sold by the board foot.  One way to calculate how many board feet are in a plank is to first calculate the number of cubic inches (width times thickness times length, all in inches) and then divide that by 144.

==2.  Collect and label five different kinds of wood used in woodworking.  Tell the advantages and disadvantages of each. ==
'''Pine'''
Pine is the most commonly available wood in North America.  Its primary advantage is that it is relatively cheap.  This is because it grows rather quickly.  Another characteristic of pine is that it is soft.  This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage.  The advantage of a soft wood is that it is easy to work.  The disadvantage is that it can break easily; delicate joinery that works fine in hardwoods will not hold up in pine.

'''Oak'''
Oak is a very common hardwood.  It is a tough wood that holds up well when stressed.  It was often used in shipbuilding because of this toughness.  Additionally, oak is fairly workable up until it is seasoned.  Seasoned oak is ''very'' hard, which makes it difficult to cut, bore, plane or drive a nail through.  This is an advantage in the finished product, but a disadvantage when trying to make something.  When using oak, it is best to use unseasoned wood, and let it season once the object has been made.

'''Maple'''
Maple is a light colored wood that can be found with highly figured grain.  Figured grain is difficult to work with, but makes for a beautiful piece of furniture.  Maple is also great for toy making because it does not easily splinter and stands up well to the abuse of even the most destructive of children.  Maple is also commonly available, and thus, is relatively cheap for a hardwood.

'''Walnut'''
Walnut is a dark hardwood.  Its color is one of its chief advantages, and is probably wood most often &quot;copied&quot; by staining lighter, cheaper woods.  Walnut also has figured grain and is fairly hard.  It holds detail well, so it can be used in making intricate joints.  It is also relatively expensive for a native hardwood.

'''Cherry'''
Cherry is another hardwood that is commonly used in furniture making.  Its color starts off as a medium brown and then slowly turns to a dark, beautiful reddish hue over time.  It takes a nice finish, and has no need for stain.  It is a little cheaper than walnut, but still fairly expensive.

'''Poplar'''
Poplar is classified as a hardwood, but it is relatively soft (though still harder than pine).  Because of its softness, it is easy to work.

'''Elm'''
Elm is a hardwood that is highly resistant to splitting.  Because if this, it was the only wood used to make the hubs of wooden wagon wheels.  It has a highly figured grain that entwines, and tangles itself in all directions - this is what makes it so difficult to split, but it also makes it difficult to plane.

==3. List the basic hand and power tools necessary to do woodworking.  Know how to safely use each tool and how to keep it in proper working order, including sharpening, if applicable. ==

Technically, no power tools are necessary for woodworking - everything can be done with handtools.  Power tools can certainly make the job easier, but they are a relatively recent tool to arrive on the woodworking scene.

=== Handsaws ===
Handsaws are tools used for cutting wood.  Handsaws come in many varieties, including the crosscut saw, rip saw, coping saw, tenon saw, backsaw, and dovetail saw.  Each has its own special use.  A crosscut saw is used for cutting across the grain of a piece of lumber.  A rip saw is used for cutting along the grain.  A coping saw is used for making curved cuts.  A tenon saw is used for cutting tenons and other fine work.  A backsaw is commonly used with a miter box and for small cutting jobs.  A dovetail saw is used for cutting dovetail joints.

To use a crosscut or a rip saw, place the board on a supported surface at thigh-height (between the knee and hips).  Grip the saw with the right hand (assuming right-handedness) and use the left knee to hold the board in place.  Align the right shoulder, arm, and hand so that they are in line with the cut to be made.  Begin with light strokes, noting that the saw cuts on the push stroke.  As the cut progresses, keep an eye on the line, pulling the blade toward it.  If this is to be a &quot;finished&quot; cut, you can score a &quot;V&quot; along the line first with a carton knife, and let the blade ride in the V groove.  Score another line along the bottom of the board to prevent tear-out.

A saw is sharpened with a triangle file.  The teeth of a rip saw (which cuts along the grain) are sharpened perpendicular to the blade.  The teeth of crosscut saw are sharpened at an angle.  Try to match the angle already ground into the teeth.  

Maintain your saws by keeping them dry and sharp.  Many tools (including saws) can be kept in great condition by wiping them down with a cloth and oil (or WD40) after each use.  Coping saw blades can be obtained cheaply enough that it is easier to replace them than it is to sharpen them.

=== Chisels ===
Chisels can be used for making a variety of cuts in wood, from mortise and tenon joints to dovetail joints.  They are often struck with a mallet or a hammer, but sometimes they are pushed by hand (watch for fingers!) to pare a joint or to smooth it.  Chisels are also used to remove wood for recessing a hinge.  To do this, the outline of the hinge is first scored with a knife, and then the wood is pared away with the chisel.

To cut a mortise, choose a chisel that is as wide as the desired mortise.  Mortises should only be cut so that they are parallel to the grain of the wood.  Mark the mortise out, and then place the chisel perpendicular to the grain, such that it covers the width of the mortise.  Strike it with the mallet.  Then move the chisel about an eighth of an inch (2-3mm) farther down the mortise and repeat.  Each &quot;bite&quot; of the chisel will go a little deeper.  When you get to the end of the mortise, reverse the chisel and take bites in the other direction (still perpendicular to the grain, but heading back toward the other end of the mortise).  Continue until the mortise reaches the desired depth.  Always cut the mortise first, and then size the tenon to fit.

To sharpen a chisel, hold it at a steady angle and drag it along a whetstone.  If you use a grinder, be careful to not overheat the tip of the chisel as this will cause it to lose its tempering.  It is better to sharpen them by hand with a whetstone, as it is very easy to overheat the blade with a grinder.

Store chisels in a way that will protect the cutting edge, either by covering them, or placing the edge where it will not come into contact with anything of equal (or greater) hardness than the blade.  Like saws, chisels can be wiped down with cloth and oil to keep rust away.

=== Hand Planes ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Woodworking Tools/Plane}}

=== Clamps ===
Clamps are used to hold a piece of wood in place while it is being worked, or to hold pieces of wood together after gluing them until the glue cures.

Clamps come in many varieties, including C-clamps and furniture clamps.  Some say that it is nearly impossible to own too many C-clamps.  When using a C-clamp in wood working be careful to not overtighten it.  The clamping surface can easily leave a circular impression on the wood.  If you need to get it really tight, place a piece of scrap between the clamping surface and your piece.  

Furniture clamps (also called bar clamps) often have padded clamping surfaces, so making unwanted impressions on the wood is avoided.  These are used for clamping large boards together, usually edge-to-edge.

Clamps can be periodically wiped down with a cloth and oil to keep rust at bay.

=== Drills, Bits, and Braces ===
Drills, Bits, and Braces are used for boring holes in wood.  A brace and bit is the &quot;old-style&quot; cordless drill.  It is hand-powered.  The brace holds the bit, and the woodworker's hand cranks it, inducing a rotation in the bit.  To drill a clean hole with either a brace and bit or a drill and bit, hold the bit perpendicular to the board and start drilling.  You can start a pilot hole with a nail or a punch first to keep the bit from wandering.  There are two ways to prevent tear-out when boring a hole.  The first method is to support the board and drill into the supporting material.  For this to work, the board and its support must be firmly clamped together.  The second method can be used if you have a bit with a point that is much narrower than the hole's diameter (such as a spade bit, a brad-point bit, or a bit with a screw-lead).  Using such a bit, drill through the material until the tip comes through the other side.  Then turn the board over and place the bit in this hole.  Continue drilling toward the center.

=== Power Tools ===
Power Tools should be used with much care.  It is difficult to cut a finger off with a hand saw, but a power saw can do this in an instant, and before the careless operator even feels any pain, a severed finger can drop to the floor.  Power tools can greatly speed production of wood projects though, so it's certainly worth having them around.  Read the owner's manual carefully before operating any piece of power equipment.  Pay special attention to safety features, and do not try to defeat them!  Pathfinders below the age of 16 should not use power tools.  Remember, power tools are not required for woodworking, they only speed it along.

==4. Explain the following joints: ==
=== Butt ===
A butt joint is the simplest of all joints, formed by butting two pieces of wood together and then joining them.  But because glue will not hold to end grain, it is a joint that must be held together by mechanical fasteners such as nails or screws.

[[Image:Butt_joint.png|350px|Butt Joint]]

=== Dado and groove ===
[[Image:Dado joint.svg|right| Dado Joint ]]
A dado and groove joint is formed by milling a slot (or dado) in one board, and inserting another board into that slot.  The width of the dado should be equal to the width of the board that will be inserted into it.  The dado is an excellent joint for joining plywood shelves to the upright sides of a bookcase.  In this case, the dado should be cut into the side, and the shelf should be inserted into the dado.  Such a shelf will support a lot of weight without relying on the strength of a mechanical fastener.  A butt joint would likely fail in this situation, with the nail or screw splitting out the top of the shelf.

The dado can also be used in regular lumber as long as the dado runs along the grain - otherwise, any glue used to secure the joint would have to adhere to the endgrain.  Plywood presents alternating layers of endgrain and straight grain to all three surfaces of the dado, and there is generally enough straight grain in the joint that gluing it works well.  Dado and groove joints can be held together with mechanical fasteners (nails or screws), or without them (assuming enough non-endgrain surfaces in the joint).

=== Dovetail ===
[[Image:dovetail.png|right|300px|Dovetail Joint]]
A dovetail joint is made by making &quot;tails&quot; in one piece of wood, and &quot;pins&quot; in the other.  In the diagram here, the tails are made in the board on the left, and the pins are made in the board on the right.  This joint is very strong and will only pull apart in one direction.  It is often used for making drawers and boxes.  When making a drawer, the pins are cut in the drawer front, and the tails are cut into the drawer sides.  This will prevent the joint from pulling apart when the drawer is opened.  A drawer facing is then glued to the front to hide the joint, or the joint can be modified to hide them inherently (these are called &quot;blind dovetails&quot;).

To make the joint, cut the tails first.  Lay them out with a bevel gauge, and saw from the edge to the line.  Remove the waste with a chisel.  Then lay this board on top of the board that will have the pins and line them up.  Mark the pins with a knife.  Then saw the pins with a dovetail saw (or a backsaw).  The waste on either side of the pins can be removed with a saw. The waste between the pins can be removed with a chisel or with a coping saw.  Assemble the joint to test it for fit, and pare the joint with a chisel if necessary.

In the illustration, the endgrain is colored orange.  When gluing a dovetail joint, don't bother applying any glue to the endgrain surfaces.  Note that the top surface of the pins (brown) are not endgrain, nor are the surfaces they mate to on the tails.

=== Dowel ===
[[Image:Dowel_joint.png|right|Dowel Joint]]
A dowel joint is formed by drilling holes in the two pieces to be joined, and inserting dowels (small wooden rods) into these holes.  The dowels are coated with glue prior to insertion.  This is most commonly done with butt joints and miter joints, as the addition of the dowel greatly increases their strength by providing gluable surfaces to the joint.

The most difficult aspect of making a dowel joint is lining the holes up on the two pieces of wood and making sure that the holes go in at a 90 degree angle.  This can be done more easily with the aid of a doweling jig.  A doweling jig resembles a clamp with a guide hole drilled into it.  It is clamped to the board which will eventually accept the dowel, and the hole is drilled by inserting the bit into the guide.  A doweling jig will ensure that the hole is drilled at a consistent distance from the board's facing edge and that it is made at a 90 degree angle.  The woodworker is still required to ensure that when multiple holes are used (recommended to prevent the joint from twisting), they are drilled the same distance apart.

=== Lap ===
[[Image:Lap_joint.png|350px|left|Lap Joint]]
A lap joint is made by overlapping two boards.  Wood is removed from the joint so that each board contributes about half of the wood in the joint.  Lap joints can be made to join boards at a 90 degree angle (as shown), no angle at all (that is, splice two boards into a longer one), or the two boards can form a cross.  This joint is ideal when you need to bring two boards together but keep them in the same plane.  It is very strong even without mechanical fasteners as there is a lot of gluable surface area in the joint.

The laps can be cut with either a saw, or a with a saw and a chisel.  Large lap joints should be cut with only a saw, but they can be trimmed with a chisel.  A dovetail saw or a backsaw works well for both cuts.

=== Miter ===
[[Image:Miter_joint.png|350px|right|Miter Joint]]

A 90 degree miter joint is formed by cutting the two boards at a 45 degree angle and joining them.   The choice of a miter joint is purely aesthetic. Miter joints are easy to cut with a power miter saw, but difficult to cut by hand.  A miter box can help, but the angle of the cut must be very nearly perfect, or the joint will either not be 90 degrees, or it will show a gap.  The gap can be eliminated by &quot;kerfing in&quot; the joint.  Kerfing in a joint is done by clamping the two pieces together and then running a fine-toothed handsaw down the joint.  Ideally, the saw should remove wood from both pieces.  This procedure can be repeated until the woodworker is happy with the fit, but keep in  mind that every time this procedure is performed, the board gets a little shorter.  For this reason, it is best to cut the miter joint first, and then cut the piece to length.  If both ends of the board are to be mitered, the board should be cut a little long and then tuned to length by kerfing it in.

Miter joints must be reinforced or they will not hold (once again, endgrain comes into play).  Usually the pieces are fastened to some underlying structure so that the miter joint is not subjected to stress, nor is it relied upon for structural integrity.  In other cases, the joint itself can be reinforced using dowels (as in a dowel joint) or some similar mechanism.

=== Mortise and Tenon ===
[[Image:Mortise_and_tenon.png|250px|right|Mortise and Tenon]]

The mortise and tenon joint is a strong joint used to join two pieces of wood usually at a 90 degree angle.  The mortise is a hole cut into one of the pieces, and the tenon is shaped to fit snugly into this hole. The tenon is usually narrower than the rest of the piece that it is cut into.  The joint may be glued, pinned, or wedged to lock it in place.

The mortise is usually cut first, and its width is equal to the width of the chisel used to cut it (see the section on chisels).  The tenon is then sized to fit the mortise, and it is cut with a tenon saw, dovetail saw, or backsaw.  The first cuts are made along the grain and are called the cheek cuts.  The final cuts are made across the grain and are called the shoulder cuts.  The tenon can be pared with a chisel to tune the fit.

=== Rabbet ===
[[Image:Rabbet.png|200px|right|Rabbet Joint]]

A rabbet joint is very similar to a dado joint, except that the groove is cut at the edge of the board.  This groove is called a rabbet.  It is also sometimes called a rebate.  A rabbet joint is often used for joining the back to a cabinet or bookcase.  It can be glued, held on with mechanical fasteners, or both.  The rabbet can be cut in either or both pieces to be joined.

A rabbet joint can be made with a table saw or a router.  It can also be made with a rabbet plane.  The blade of a rabbet plane comes all the way to the edge of the tool so that it can remove wood from the corner of the rabbet.

==5. Know the characteristics of and how to work with the following: ==
=== Hardboard ===
Hardboard (also called Masonite) is an engineered wood product made by turning wood chips into long fibers by steaming them.  These fibers are then heated and pressed into a solid board.  Hardboard is sold in 4'x8' sheets of various thicknesses in the United States.  It is an extremely stable material, expanding and contracting very little with changes in temperature and humidity.  It is highly homogeneous, having no distinct grain.  Because of its lack of grain it behaves very differently as compared to regular lumber.  

Hardboard has high bending strength, but has very little structural strength, so it cannot be used in many applications where plywood or regular lumber are more suited.  It can be used for building arches, and its strength can be improved by laminating several sheets together.  Hardboard is often used as drawer bottoms, or as the back of cabinets, etc.

=== Particle Board ===
From [http://www.wikipedia.com Wikipedia], the free encyclopedia.

Particle board (sometimes called chipboard) is a material manufactured from wood particles (for example, wood chips, sawmill shavings, or even saw dust) and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. Particle board is very dense, heavy, and flat. It is used as a cheaper and less durable substitute for solid wood or plywood. Particle board is very prone to expansion due to moisture.

Particle board should not be used in applications where it is likely to get wet.  It is generally not used in furniture making unless it is covered with a veneer (or in inexpensive furniture, a vinyl covering similar to wallpaper).  It is not generally finished with stain, varnish, or paint, as aesthetics are not high on its list of characteristics.  It is, however used in the hidden portions of woodworking projects such as drawer backs and sides.

=== Plywood ===
From [http://www.wikipedia.com Wikipedia], the free encyclopedia.

Plywood was the first type of engineered wood to be invented. It is made from thin sheets of wood veneer, called plies, which are stacked together with the direction of each ply's grain differing from its neighbors by 90° (cross-banding). The plies are bonded under heat and pressure with strong adhesives, usually phenol formaldehyde resin, making plywood a type of composite material.

A vast number of varieties of plywood exist, tailored for all manner of conditions and uses. Softwood plywood is usually made either of Douglas fir or spruce, pine, and fir. Decorative plywood is usually faced with hardwood, including red oak, birch, maple, lauan (Philippine mahogany) and a large number of other hardwoods.

Plywood production requires a good log, called a peeler, generally straighter and larger in diameter than that required for processing by a sawmill. The log is peeled into sheets of veneer which are then cut to the desired dimensions, dried, patched and glued together to form the plywood panel. The panel can then be patched, resized, sanded or otherwise refinished, depending on the market it was intended to be sold in.

The most common varieties of softwood plywood comes in three, five or seven plies with dimensions of 4 feet × 8 feet. Each ply is 1/8 inch. 

A common reason for using plywood instead of plain wood is because plywood is more stable and because it is less prone to change (shrink, twist or warp).  Plywood is stronger than particle board and hardboard, and because the outer layers can be made from fine hardwoods, it is often used in furniture making.  It is suitable for natural finishing or painting.

==6. Know at least two ways to finish the edges of plywood. ==

Unfortunately, some layers of plywood often have knots in them, and the knots fall out before the layers are glued together.  This leaves a void.  In furniture-grade plywood these voids will be confined to the inner layers.  In order to finish the edge of plywood, you can either fill these voids with a wood putty, or you can cover the edges with a band of material - typically, a veneer or a thin strip of wood.  Some veneers are made expressly for this purpopse, and they come with an adhesive on one side.  By heating the veneer, the adhesive is activated.  When it cools, the adhesive bonds to the edge of the plywood.  If you plan to use a natural finish, banding works best, because wood putties and wood tend to take natural finishes unevenly.  This results in a splotchy finish where the wood putty stands out rather than concealing the defect.  Either method can be used if you plan to finish with paint.

==7. Demonstrate the proper technique of gluing and clamping wood. ==
The first rule of gluing wood joints is that glue does not stick to end-grain.  Most woodworking joints were in fact designed to avoid the application of glue to an end-grain surface.  Evaluate your joint first, and find two non end-grain surfaces that will come into contact.  After making a test fit, apply glue to one of these surfaces.  Spread the glue in a thin layer, being careful to not use too much glue.  Then clamp the two pieces together.  Use enough clamping pressure so that the pieces are held firmly together, but do not use so much force that all the glue is squeezed out of the joint.  Once clamped, the pieces should be left alone until the glue sets.  Setting times vary from one glue to the next, so read the instructions on the glue container.

==8. Choose a plan for and complete an article of household furniture, such as a small table, footstool, writing desk, or bookcase.  List the materials needed for your project. ==
There are thousands of plans available on the Internet, and many of them can be downloaded for free.  Others are offered for a fee.  You can also find plans in books and in woodworking magazines (although the magazines tend to have more complex plans).  Choose plans that are simple.  Although the instructor may be an experienced woodworker, the student is often not.  Avoid complicated joints such as dovetails and mortise and tenons.  Butt joints, dados, and lap joints are within the reach of a 12 year-old, so steer your Pathfinders to projects that use them.  Use lots of pine.  Pine is relatively inexpensive, and using it makes it a lot easier to start over.  It can be heartbreaking to watch a youngster destroy an expensive piece of wood, and the temptation to salvage it (and thus ruin the project) can be overwhelming.  Save complicated projects and expensive hardwoods for after the Pathfinder develops some skill.

[[image:Sm_table_complete.jpg|240px|right|Small Table]]

The table described here has been successfully constructed by a group of Pathfinders ranging from Friend to Guide.  It is relatively inexpensive, as seven tables can be constructed from a single sheet of plywood, five 8-foot 2x4's, some plywood banding, 28 1/2&quot; #8 woodscrews, seven dozen 1.5&quot; #8 woodscrews, some flat metal brackets, and some 3/8&quot; dowels.  Seven is a good number of Pathfinders for two instructors to handle in this honor.  More Pathfinders (or fewer instructors)  and it is difficult to give them the attention they'll need to execute the project successfully.

=== Preparations by the Instructor ===
The instructor should rip the 2x4's into 2x2's, and perhaps crosscut them into 30&quot; lengths (although this can be left to the Pathfinder).  These 2x2's will make the legs of the table, and the instructor should make sure the legs are square (that is, each side should be 1.5&quot; or 1.25&quot;  wide - the exact measurement is immaterial so long as it is the same on all four sides).

[[image:Sm_table_parts.jpg|240px|right|Small Table Parts]]

The instructor should also cut the plywood into squares.  For seven tables, 14 12&quot;x12&quot; squares (for the bottom and middle shelves) and 7 14&quot;x14&quot; squares should be made (for the tops).  These should be made from furniture-grade plywood with a hardwood veneer.  Birch veneer works well for this.

=== Cut the corners ===
The Pathfinder should mark the corners of the shelves by measuring in 1 inch from each corner and drawing a line across the corner.  If the shelves are square, this should make a perfect 45° angle.  Do not cut the corners off the 14&quot;x14&quot; tabletop.  Save the corners, as they can be used to correct a common mistake (discussed below).

=== Notch the legs ===
The pathfinder should then cut two notches in each of the four legs in the three steps shown below:

[[image:Sm_table_cut_legs.jpg|350px|Cutting the Notches]]

'''1:''' Mark a pencil line one inch from the corner edge of the leg.  Do this on two adjacent sides.

'''2:''' Measure the width of the plywood and mark where the notches are to be cut with a square.  It is better to mark all the legs at the same time, making sure leg bottoms are flush and the notches all line up.  Once all the notches have been marked, a notch can be made by cutting two kerfs (saw cuts) through the corner of the leg stopping when the line is reached.  You may wish to score the notches with a carton knife before using the saw.  Make the first score on the line, holding the knife at a 90° angle.  Then make a second score at a steeper angle next to the first score line, but towards the middle of the notch so that the two make a V.  Remove wood from the V.  This will give you a defined groove for the saw blade to ride in.  Pay close attention to ''both'' lines when cutting, and be sure to take the width of the kerf into account when making the cuts.  The width of the notch should equal the width of the plywood.  

'''3:''' Use a 3/4&quot; chisel and a mallet to remove the wood between the kerfs.  Do not try to remove all the wood at once, but rather, remove a quarter inch on the first three passes, and an eighth of an inch on the final passes.  Pay attention to the pencil lines.

=== Attach the Shelves===
The next step is to attach the shelves to the legs.  This can be done using dowels or screws.  In either case, drill holes into the leg from the outside, centered on the notches.  Put the shelf into the notch, and drill a hole into it, using the hole in the leg as a pilot.  If using dowels, use the same sized bit (sized for the dowel, 3/8&quot; recommended).  If using 1.5&quot; #8 screws, use a 1/8&quot; bit, and then counter sink the hole in the leg 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot; deep.  The screws can be covered with dowels or with wood putty (but don't use wood putty unless you plan to paint).

=== Correcting Problems ===
If the notches are too wide, use a chisel to shear a ply off the corners that were removed from the shelves and wedge it beneath the shelf.  Note that this is a corrective procedure only - it is much more desirable to cut the notches to the proper width.  Using this technique pretty much decides that the table will be finished with paint instead of with a natural finish, but it can still come out looking pretty good.  If the notches are not wide enough, use a chisel to widen them a bit.  Don't overdo it.

If the notch is too wide to be corrected with a single ply from a corner, discard that leg and start over.  That's why the legs are made from 2x4's - you can get six legs from a single 2x4, so each leg will run you about 50 cents (in 2005 anyhow).

Once both shelves have been attached to all four legs, the screws can be covered with dowels (if the screws were countersunk) or with wood putty.

=== Fasten the Top ===
Finally, it is time to add the top.  The easiest way to do this is by using flat metal brackets.  Look for them in the fastener department of the hardware store.  Basically, they should be pieces of steel about 3/8 inch wide and 2 inches long, with holes drilled in either end.  At least one of these holes should be countersunk, or they should be countersunk on opposite sides of the bracket. 

[[Image:Leg_bracket1-4.png|600px|thumb|1. Bore first hole; 2. Overlap second hole; 3. Connect the channels; 4. Attach the bracket]]

&lt;br&gt;

Mill a groove into the top of the leg to accept the bracket.  This can be done with a 3/4&quot; spade bit or auger.  Drill into the endgrain no more than an eighth of an inch, centered on the leg.  Drill a second hole overlapping the first, and make sure the edge of the hole extends over the inside corner of the leg top.  If necessary, chisel out a channel between the two holes and then lay the bracket in the channel.  The brackets should point towards the center of the table top.  

Attach the brackets to the legs using 1.5 inch #8 screws.  Make sure that bracket is oriented such that the ''other'' hole will be countersunk when a screw is passed through it into the bottom of the tabletop.  

Once the brackets are attached, turn the top upside down (choose the best surface for the top), and place the rest of the table on top of it.  Center to the best of your ability.  The table top is oversized to hide any &quot;unsquareness&quot; of the rest of the table.  If the unit will not lay flat on the table top, mark the underside of the tabletop where the screws are touching it.  This can be done by daubing a little wood putty on the screw head.  Remove the unit and drill a small hole no more than a quarter inch deep into the underside of the table top.  It helps to wrap a piece of masking tape around the drill bit at the desired depth so the woodworker can stop when the tape reaches the wood.  Replace the unit on the table top again.

Drive screws through the brackets into the underside of the table.  Again, use #8 screws, but remember that the table top is only 3/4&quot; thick.  Play it safe and use 1/2&quot; long screws.

=== Finishing ===
The only thing that remains is to finish the plywood edges and paint (or use a natural finish).  Use veneer banding for this, following the instructions on the label.  Trim the edges of the veneer off with a carton knife or a chisel.  Sand the table and apply two coats of paint or stain and varnish.

If this is a first-time project, the Pathfinder is likely to achieve better results with paint than with stain and varnish.  If painting, go back over the piece and cover all screw holes and imperfect shelf joints with wood putty.  Woodworking masters eschew wood putty, but it is appropriate for the novice.  Wood putty and paint can cover a multitude of woodworking sins!

=== Leveling ===
If the table needs to be leveled, place it on a flat surface such as a workbench or a table covered with hard board or cheap plywood.  Have one of the longer legs hang off the edge while the other three are in contact with the flat surface.  Use a saw to cut the bottom of the offending leg off by laying the blade on the flat surface and drawing it into the leg.  This '''will''' mar the surface of the table unless a &quot;flush cut&quot; saw is used, but executed properly, it is by far the easiest way to level a table or a chair.

==9. Know and use the proper steps in finishing a wood project with either natural finish or stain. ==
The first step in finishing a wood project is to make sure all the surfaces are smooth.  This is most commonly done by sanding the surfaces with sandpaper, starting with rougher paper (80-100 grit) and then progressing though successively finer grits (often to 220 grit).  Sanding is only necessary if the surface is not already smooth, and some tools (notably planes and cabinet scrapers) will leave a sufficiently smooth surface so that sanding is unnecessary.  In fact, sandpaper was patented in the United States in 1834, and woodworking had been going on for millennia prior to that!  

The next step in finishing is to remove all dust and dirt from the surface.  This can be done by wiping the wood down with a tack cloth, or with a soft cloth which has been wet with mineral spirits.  Tack cloth is a soft cloth that has been treated with various finishing compounds (such as mineral spirits and varnish) so that it is slightly sticky or &quot;tacky.&quot;  It picks up any wood dust it comes into contact with.

Once the surface has been prepared, it can be stained.  This can be done by wiping the stain on with a soft cloth (wear vinyl gloves) or with a paint brush.  Read the instructions on the can.  Staining wood can even out its color.  It generally does not fool an experienced woodworker into thinking pine is really walnut or cherry.  Staining is optional.

Once the project has been stained (if staining was desired), it can be coated with a finish such as varnish, polyurethane, or tung oil.  The purpose of these finishes is to reduce the absorption of moisture.  Some finishes do this better than others.  Recall that as wood absorbs moisture, its shape changes, so limiting the amount of moisture the project can absorb is a very desirable thing to do.

These finishes are applied again with either a soft cloth (wear gloves!) or a paint brush. You can also buy finishes in spray cans.  Several coats are applied, but remember that it is always better to apply several thin coats rather than a few thick ones.  Again, read the instructions on the can.  Some finishes require that the product dry completely between coats, and others do not.

Make sure the finish is applied in a dust free environment, and do not stir varnish prior to its application, as this will only introduce bubbles which will appear in the finished product.  If you do get bubbles, they can be rubbed out between coats with very fine sand paper or with steel wool.  The final coat should not be sanded but should rather be polished with a soft cloth.

==10. Do two of the following: ==
=== Make a project with a door or lid with inset hinges. ===
=== Make a scale model of a house or building with a cutaway view showing the interior detail.===

'''One way to do this is to create a 1:20th scale model that looks much as a real house does before it has siding and a roof put on it'''.  Use balsa wood, a sharp razor blade, and balsa glue.  

Create a house plan (keep it simple).  You may use typical houseplans that are available in Houseplan magazines and books or create your own.

In order to achieve greatest accuracy, it is recommended that you draw out the scale model to full size grid-paper.  Make sure to mark all doorways, windows, entries, and stairs.

Determine what balsa wood sizes will represent each of the standard stud sizes.

'''Another option''' is to build a doll house out of wood.  These are usually 1:12 scale models, and make a great gifts! Doll House kits are available for sale online.

'''Purchasing the kit or the balsa wood can be rather expensive'''.  Talk with the hobby shop in your town before beginning!  They'll probably help you make the wisest financial decisions.  This would be a great project to work on as a class or unit!

=== Assist in making and/or repairing wooden toys for needy children. ===
Any toys you make can be included in the packages that are often delivered to needy families during the Pathfinder's Can Collecting activity.  

[[Image:Toy_tugboat_illustration.png|250px|right|frame|Tugboat]]
'''Tugboat'''&lt;br&gt;
An easy toy to make is a small tug boat.  This can be made from two pieces of scrap wood and a dowel - dimensional lumber (2x4's) works great for this.  The bottom piece makes the boat's hull and deck, and the top layer makes the cabin.  Cut the hull to shape with a coping saw and smooth with a rasp.  Before cutting the cabin to its final dimensions, drill the hole for the smokestack.  It's a lot easier to drill into a large piece of wood than it is to drill into a small piece.  You could also clamp the cabin in a vise for drilling.  If desired, bore the hole at a slight angle (about 5°) so the smokestack tilts back. Glue the smokestack dowel into the cabin, and glue the cabin onto the hull.  If you use a waterproof glue such as epoxy, the glue joint will be strong enough to not require further reinforcement.  Otherwise, reinforce the cabin/hull joint with screws through the bottom of the hull into the cabin.  Make sure the screw is well recessed so that it does not scratch the floor (or table) when the tug is dragged around.  Optionally, you can drill a small hole straight down through the deck near the front of the boat, and drill a larger hole into the hull from the bottom so that it meets the small hole.  Pass a rope through the hole and tie a knot in it to keep it from pulling through the smaller of the two holes.  It would be easier to use an eye screw, but this may present a choking hazard to small children.  Sand well, and finish with colorful paint.

'''Car'''&lt;br&gt;
Another option is to make Pinewood Derby cars.  See the instructions in the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Pinewood Derby|Pinewood Derby]] section of the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts|Arts and Crafts]] chapter of this book.

=== Make a project using dowel, miter, or mortise and tenon joints. ===
=== Make a project using curved cuts, or beveled or rounded edges. ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">That sounds good - I'm a bit iffy about leaving out the pure grammar lessons entirely, though - I don't think it's possible to have adequate grammar if grammar lessons are disposed of entirely - but I am all for having grammar more integrated into the topic of the lesson.  Maybe occasionally have a 'Grammar Lesson'?

Perhaps expand Petit(e)s Ami(e)s into just &quot;relationships&quot; - so can talk about relationships with families, friends, etc.

Maybe have a revision lesson (+quizlet) every three lessons or so?  

Here are some lesson suggestions - if I seem to be duplicating, it might be because I think there should be more in that topic than you are currently suggesting:
===Beginners===
*Ca va? (perhaps have some material from la corps here, but it should be fairly early in the lessons)
*Quelle heure est-il? - What's the time? (inc. 24 hour time)
*Months and Days - Birthdays, Saints' days, seasons. (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
*Decris-toi! - Describe yourself (personality and looks, also be able to describe others)
*Je suis perdu! - I'm lost! (Asking where places are, directions)


===Intermediate/Advanced===
Can I please suggest some lesson subjects?  (pinched from the Board of Studies, NSW, Australia).. ;)
*&quot;Relationships&quot; - do you get on with your family/friends, what kind of a friend are you, talk about your relationship with your petit(e) ami(e).
*&quot;School Life and Aspirations&quot; - what kind of career do you want in the future, what are your favourite subjects and why, do you learn well from your profs, etc.
*&quot;Young Person's World&quot; - pop culture, mass media, politics, what they think of fashion, if they have a part-time job.
*&quot;Leisure and Interests&quot; - hobbies, leisure, past hobbies, technology, mobile/cell phones
*&quot;Daily Life/Lifestyles&quot; - self explicatory, really.  
*&quot;Controversial Issues&quot; - again, fairly self explicatory.
*&quot;Quand j'etais petit(e)&quot; - talk about yourself as a child. (learn the past tense for stuff that's dead and gone) 
see [http://www.boredofstudies.org/community/showthread.php?t=37468&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15] for more info/ideas. Thanks! - [[User:220.237.30.150|220.237.30.150]] 23:39, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== French overhaul ==

Hey there. I am a Wikipedian new to Wikibooks but I found the French book and I must say, it is indeed in need of a dire overhaul. Once you return from your vacance, please contact me at [[w:User_talk:Averykrouse|my talk page]] on WP. I would be more than happy to partner up with you for such an endeavor.</text>

-----

1) Position:  You have probably heard the expression &quot;location, location, location&quot; in real estate.  That doesn't mean anything in wrestling. The wrestling (or grappling) corollary is &quot;position, position, position.&quot;  Indeed, I would argue (simply to make the point academically as, of course, I do teach &quot;technique&quot;) that there is no such thing as &quot;technique,&quot; only increasingly good positions variously strung together with movement that increase the favorability of your being able to control your opponent along the way.  Sticking with the context of takedowns on this post, #1 would be to maintain a good stance and position on your feet as you approach and move with your opponent.  Between this and #'s 2, 3, and 4 (and whatever number defense will involve--OK I might cheat and go beyond 7), if your opponent can't effectively initiate an attack and score on you, because your position, movement, attacking, and tie-ups/clinching is very effective, the worst situation is a draw (if we are talking solely takedowns); and if you have some of the other 7 points down, you should be able to score yourself.

The main points here would be a) knees bent, back angled slightly (not exactly vertical, not horizontal) with your chest, knee, and ball of foot roughly aligned, b) generally being in a staggered stance although you need to be able to move in a square stance, c) head up, visual attention directed to your opponent's chest, d) weight mostly on the balls of your feet, equally distributed between each foot, and e) hands out in front, palms facing each other (to keep elbows in).

Along these lines, a) learn one side first (e.g., lead right or left, I like left because that is also my boxing lead so I keep left leg forward in MMA so I don't clue my opponent as to whether a striking or takedown attack is coming, b) focus on different techniques depending upon whether your opponent leads the same or mirrored leg to you versus switching your lead if your opponent &quot;doesn't cooperate&quot; by leading the leg you hope he leads (e.g., with my left leg lead, I attack double or outside single to my opponent's left side if his left leg is lead or I go to head inside single on the right if his right leg is lead; that being said, eventually, you want to develop some competence with the other leg being lead but first develop competence on one side), and c) if you do MMA, STILL first learn the traditional wrestling stance and way of attacking so you learn to properly and consistently learn to lower your level on attack.

2) Movement:  Position is not static but fluid.  The trick is to move while maintaining good position, minimizing openings favorable for your opponent to attack, and maximizing your ability to quickly and effectively attack your opponent.  A) don't cross your feet, b) take small, short, low steps to be able to initiate an offensive or defensive maneuver quickly (for at least half of the time your foot is off the ground (i.e., moving downward from the top of the arc of your step) you can't redirect your movement unit it makes contact with the mat--and that is a clue to a good time to initiate an attack on your opponent), and c) don't let your feet get too close together as you step.

3) Initiating Attacks:  A) lower your level simultaneously with your set-up (but lower level before your transition in so your trajectory is into your opponent, not downward and into the mat), b) your hips lower but the angle of your back remains about the same and your head remains up, eyes open, directing your visual attention to your opponent all the way in (typically towards his chest), c) lean forward slightly prior to initiating your attack (just as you would if you are preparing for a sprint vs. starting a jog), d) don't back up with your body or hands before you attack (a common mistake; as I lower my level my weight is subtly shifting forward before I step in), d) consider moving your hands to your opponent's legs a millisecond before you step in with the reason being that smaller muscles can't be recruited for movement quicker and more deceptively than larger muscles and assist in more stealthily attacking (think of the cartoon analogy where the character punches and his arm stretches out &quot;pulling&quot; the rest of his body after), e) hand movement needs to be linear (from where they are to where they need to be; shortest distance...quickest), most typically striking straight out, elbows in (think &quot;Alien's mouth&quot; analogy), f) don't drag your rear foot on attacks utilizing the penetration step, g) your speed and continued momentum into your opponent are, in part, predicated on quickly following up with your rear foot instead of having it &quot;hang out there&quot; (your rear foot should &quot;catch up&quot; to a frame a millisecond behind your knee making contact with the mat; think simultaneous will help you here), h) don't blink your eyes but keep your visual attention on your target the whole way in (you would be amazed how many people blink or close their eye when attacking), i) on any penetration step attack, momentum CONTINUES through your opponent so your finish must transition immediately and logically (i.e., the particular finish for the particular position you end up with relative to your opponent's initial defensive maneuver); your goal is not simple to &quot;land in front of your opponent&quot; but to continue moving through him.

4) Tie-ups and clinch and set-ups:  Your ability to control your opponent while on your feet is predicated on your ability to move him and to keep him in unfavorable position to attack you and position favorable for you to attack.  Set-ups are important (e.g., head pop, arm post, drag, etc.) but being able to physically manipulate your opponent so they are unable to attack your effectively is king.  A) developing proficiency with pummeling, underhooks, 2-on-1, PROPERLY utilized collar tie, etc. is crucial.  Against high caliber opponent's a simple forehead tap, quick hand movements to distract him, moving myself, are likely of little utility.  It's not about how much you move yourself (which you actually generally want to be economical to maintain your own good position) but how effectively you move your opponent and you have to make contact to move a good opponent.  B) associated with this, it is crucial to be able to logically and fluidly transition from on tie or clinch position to another so that your opponent is continually preoccupied by having to break your tie and control.  A secret to this is to become proficient in controlling and moving your opponent's head in the process of pummeling, clinch, and ties.  It would take a separate post on pummeling and clinch to get into the details of all of this.  Suffice to say competitive pummeling is NOT just underhook and overhook arms swimming back and forth with your opponent.

5) Think high or low in attacking.  You asked, basically, about favorite techniques.  Before I get into that, I would suggest first conceptualizing your attacking in two domains, low and high.  &quot;Low&quot; is attacking below the waist, mostly with your hands, and &quot;high&quot; is attacking the waist and above with your hands and, paradoxically, attacking the legs with your legs.  For example, (hand to) leg attacks are typically successfully done when your opponent's level is relatively high either because his level was spontaneously that way or because of your manipulating him with a tie-up or set-up.  Sometimes a person is just too darn well defended to easily attack his legs, most typically, at least in part, because his level is relatively low.  When his level is too low to attack his legs (with my hands), his head is usually low enough to attack (snap down or snap to front headlock).  When I am doing this and his level gets higher, either the legs become more open for a leg attack or I can do leg-to-leg attacks such as inside and outside trips or I can throw.  Breaking this down to the most basic level to learn, I am first trying for doubles, head outside singles, and high head inside singles.  If my opponent is to low for me to attack his legs successfully, I know his head is low enough to attack (snap) to a front headlock.  Instead of getting frustrated with continued unsuccessful leg attacks, I simply transition to attacking the head.  If he defends this successfully, his head is going up as is his level, at least to some degree, so I focus on attacking the legs...and on and on.  The upshot of this is that against high caliber opponents, you can't depend on success with &quot;just leg shots.&quot;  Even if your front headlock is poor with regard to scoring, you need to have proficiency at least to a level to threaten your opponent into more favorable position to attack his legs.  I hope that I am getting the notion of &quot;back and forth&quot; or &quot;high and low&quot; across adequately.

6) Basic seven movements:  You asked about the &quot;favorite seven.&quot;  The so-called basic seven movement skills (although I sometimes see somewhat different numbers associated with this) of USA wrestling are key.  These movements/skills are the foundation for good wrestling.

7) Body build/technique and strategy match:  Your body type, in my view, dictates, at least to some degree, the type of techniques and positions you favor and those to avoid.  For example, being small, my game is to prioritize attacking my opponent's legs as, usually, my level is (more comfortably) lower.  When I can't do that, I go to the head.  With one of the guys at Absolute Jiu Jitsu, who is tall, I try to get him to tie up, get underhooks, and attack the head as his priority.  Because of his height, he will have a bit more difficulty attacking his opponent's legs so I try to have him, for example, work underhooks (jacking his opponent up with the underhook because he is taller vs. sagging down with it as I do because I am smaller than my opponents) with good head position.  Being smaller than my opponents, it is very crucial for me to avoid an overhook position to my taller opponent's underhook; a taller individual, however, has some more realistic options with an overhook.  Generally, with little people, tie-ups involve sagging; with taller people jacking their shorter opponent's up.  The upshot of this is your base techniques, tactics, and strategy must be rationally related to your body build, physical attributes (e.g., slower folks want to focus on getting good tie-ups and staying in close and not focus on trading &quot;pinging&quot; leg attacks from a greater range) against most opponents (and, of course, specific opponents).

8) Killer defense:  When an opponent does attack, he needs to be punished for the audacity and lack of respect.  Sprawling and wizzers (etc.) are important but understanding the idea of putting and keeping your attacking opponent's head underneath your abdomen or hip.  This would be a long topic for another day but defense needs to be conceptualized in terms of &quot;lines of defense.&quot;  The first level is that if you are attacking and your opponent is defending, your defending is a moot point.  The second line of defense is controlling the tie-up.  Different tie-ups eliminate or make difficult various attacks by your opponent.  In other words, learn which tie-ups prevent which of your opponent's attacks and focus on defending the ones must likely successful from that tie-up.  The third line of defense not letting your opponent get past your head (learn to keep forehead contact with your opponent to &quot;feel&quot; his intent to attack then keep blocking with your head).  If he gets past your head, the next line of defense is with your hands or arm blocking his head and/or shoulders if opponent gets by your head.  This is front headlock city territory.  The LAST major line of defense is when your opponent gets to your leg (of course, I'm not talking about defending various tie-ups, throws, etc., just leg attacks here).  It is at this point where virtually all non-wrestlers and, frankly, most wrestlers, make mistakes.  Again, getting into defense in a detailed manner is for another day but suffice to say your immediate goal is to get your opponent's head under your abdomen or hip, get out in front, pull him down and either spin behind or front headlock (all of which involve a lot of technique to be done correctly).  In the process, you can torture your opponent and make him more hesitant to attack your legs.  This style of defense (level 5) works BEAUTIFULLY with BJJ and submission wrestling as you can easily transition quickly to positions where you can work submissions.  I am just a little squirt and I'm not even close to weighing what others do in our school but I can put a hurting on guys substantially larger with the concept of (opponent's) &quot;head down&quot; defense.

9) Some favorites of mine: Talking actual (takedown) attacks, my goal is to mix attacks based upon aggressive pummeling, clinching, and handfighting, including working a lot on the head then thinking &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high.&quot;  This &quot;preparation&quot; work is crucial and pays dividends.  The more active your pummeling and handfighting, the more successful will be your actual attack; the converse is true as well.  This may sound lame but I score most on a head outside single, then high head inside single, then double leg, at least with traditional leg attacks.  However, I mix this in with frequent head snaps to a front headlock and pull my opponent down to the mat and spin behind, etc. when I have tugged his weight on his hands so he can not reach up and catch me as I come around back.  For throws, which I think is an art that is fading away owing to changes in freestyle and greco rules, I like a fireman's carry (works well against relatively bigger guys who would cause me some hesitation in attacking their legs.  I love arm throws and arm spins but the latter you need to cautious in finishing and repositioning quickly so you avoid a choke.  I also love inside and outside trips, both of which are underutilized, in my view.  Finally, I like foot sweeps (e.g., from &quot;over and under&quot; position while pummeling) as well as a more nontraditional foot sweep when I am in a regular stance at handfighting distance which I use to off-balance my opponent or sometimes kick my opponent's leg to a grab a head inside single.

Of course, if preparation (e.g., pummeling, handfighting) is &quot;phase one&quot; and attacking (e.g., &quot;the shot&quot;) is &quot;phase two,&quot; you still need to have a good &quot;phase three&quot; in terms of finishes to complete the takedown especially as your opponent responds to your attack with various defensive maneuvers.  That last phase is also a whole new discussion and is rather technique or situation specific.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I might get started on a generic Intro to Programming book for use in &quot;Intro to X&quot; courses for [[Wikiversity:School_of_Computer_Science|Wikiversity: School of CompSci]]. Book would cover generic programming concepts (from variable assignments/calculations to control structures to functions) with examples in several languages.

'''Tentative Outline'''
*Variables
**Concept of a Variable - What one is, why they're important, and data types (integer, float, string, etc.)
**Initialisation - Discussion of allocation of memory.
**Assignment - They're called 'variables' for a reason.
**Operations - Basic math stuff for numerical variables, and string operations.
*Comparisons/Boolean Operations
**This would basically be the whole &quot;Less than/greater than/etc.&quot; and &quot;OR/AND/NOT/etc.&quot; in prepraration for the next section.
*Basic Control Structures
**If-Then-Else
**While/Do-While
**For-Next
**Switch
*Functions - Discussion of inputs/outputs.
**Standard Functions (Ones included with basic libraries or by default)
***I/O
***Mathematical
***Other things I forgot
*Arrays
**Libraries - This is just a basic overview of the expandability of programming languages.
*Program Structure - Now that we've defined the basic elements of programming languages, we can begin to build a program.
**&quot;Hello World&quot;-type program
**Creation of a program to perform a task

Examples may be provided in a large number of languages, either directly in-line or as links to other books. However, considering that this book is intended to be a very introductory look at the basic building blocks of programming languages in general, the examples should either be provided in as many different languages as possible, in pseudo-code, or not at all.

For section 5, Program Structure, this is where pseudo-code starts to be insufficient. As such, the examples here would be very basic in nature. For example, the Hello World program might be as follows:

 Include IO Library
 
 main:
  output &quot;Hello, World&quot;
  quit

A certain style of pseudo-code would be introduced throughout the book, and would inevitably be creating a pseudo-language of sorts. The task program could be, perhaps, to read in 5 numbers from a file and output the numbers, their average, and each number squared to the screen. The squaring would need to be computed via a function. The pseudo-code might look something like this:

 Include IO Library
 Include File Library
 
 Declare function square(integer n) returns integer
 
 main:
  declare numbers (array of 5 integers)
  declare sum (integer)
  declare average (float)
  open file
  for (1 to 5)
   get number from file and store in numbers array
  
  set sum to 0
  for (1 to 5)
   add numbers to sum
  divide sum by 5 and store in average
  
  for (1 to 5)
   output numbers
  output average
  for (1 to 5)
   output square(numbers)
  quit
 
 function square(integer n) returns integer:
  return n*n

The format may need to be worked on a bit, I'm not entirely sure how to present functions in pseudocode yet. Generally the point is to show the code in words rather than syntax as much as possible, but once you get into functions you almost have to use ''some'' syntax of some sort. However, by this point in the book, all of the individual concepts will have been explained and the general idea from here is to tie the concepts together into an entire program that could be translated into any language (for the most part). For something like FreeBasic, you wouldn't have a Main function and you wouldn't have to include any libraries for screen or file IO, but anything like that would be covered in the very opening areas of any course on the subject. 
The above program wouldn't be given straight out, but built piece-by-piece throughout the chapter, in the format of solving the &quot;problem&quot; at hand: Getting numbers from a file and outputting the average and squares. This kind of thing is what I originally intended by the purpose of the book but I'm now seeing that for any larger programs it'll be extremely difficult to explain with elegant psuedocode.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A few things I've noticed:
*First off, even your single-line code examples should probably be put in code blocks. It would probably also be made more clear if the new term/operator was bolded. For the AND example:

 statement1 '''&amp;&amp;''' statement2

*I personally prefer the term 'expression' over 'statement' in this case, to me a statement implies an entire line of code, while an expression is something that's evaluated down to a single value. 
*In 'Chains of Combinations' the given expression !(statement1 &amp;&amp; (statement2 || statement3)) evaluates to true if statement1 is false, or if both statements 2 and 3 are false. Regardless of what statement1 is, statement 2 &amp; 3 both being false would force the entire expression to be false, and the NOT would make it true. So perhaps it should read:
''This chain would be true if statement 1 is false (no matter what statements 2 and 3 are), or if statements 2 and 3 are both false.''
*'Comparisons' should make special note of the difference between the double and single equals signs; although the linked-to WikiBook makes note of this it deserves to be reiterated. Considering that the module is supposed to be a class lecture it should hit on such &quot;easy mistakes&quot; with great force. 
*Also of note here is the lack of discussion on order-of-operations to this point; complex expressions are already being introduced and yet it hasn't been covered in lecture or side-reading yet. This could possibly be confusing as those not accustomed to programming practices may be expecting expressions to evaluate left-to-right. If there's one place that's a good place to introduce it, however, it would be after the Combining Statements section. The very last subsection of that, 'Chains of Combinations' would probably work out better in the order-of-ops section anyway. 
*In the course index, the layout isn't consistent. Lesson 1 has Lecture followed by Reading; Lesson 2 has Reading and then Lecture. 
*I'm going to go through right now and make some grammatical/spelling fixes, it should be noted that Quizzes has 2 Z's.
*I'd like to hear other comments on this before making major edits, but I'll put in some small changes now. This class doesn't seem to be &quot;live&quot; yet so there's still time to get some things sorted out. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 02:36, 26 October 2005 (UTC)


:All of those things sound like improvements to me.  What you don't get to before then, I'll ty and fix up tomorrow night.  I know this material needs a lot of work.  So does the book, for that matter.  Its good to have another pair of eyes looking at it, some things seem so natural you forget you have to tell people about it after a while.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 09:20, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">With CELX it's easy to create custom key functions, and assign them to different keys on your keyboard. Here's how:

First, you create a Lua function using CELX to implement your custom function. In this example, we'll create a new key function which zooms the active view so that the currently selected object fills the view:

&lt;tt&gt;
 zoomToFit= function()
    obs = celestia:getobserver()
    obsPos = obs:getposition()
    sel = celestia:getselection()
    if sel == nil or sel:name() == &quot;?&quot; then return end
    selPos = sel:getposition()
    dist = obsPos:distanceto(selPos)
    rad = sel:radius()
    appDia = 2*math.atan(rad/dist)
    obs:setfov(appDia*1.20)
    celestia:flash(&quot;Zoom to fit &quot;..sel:name(), 2) 
   end
&lt;/tt&gt;

Next, you create a table which maps a selected key to your new function. In this example, we'll use the &quot;z&quot; key:

&lt;tt&gt;
 keymap = {
    z = zoomToFit
 }
&lt;/tt&gt;

Then, you create a key handling function to call your new Lua function when the desired key is pressed, and assign it as the Celestia keyboard callback:

&lt;tt&gt;
   celestia_keyboard_callback = function(key) 
       f = keymap[key]
       if f then 
          f() 
          return true
       end
          return false
   end
&lt;/tt&gt;

Note that when there's a custom key definition for the input key, the callback returns &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; to indicate to Celestia that no further processing of the key is needed. Otherwise it returns &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;, and Celesta will handle the key according to the built-in key function assignments.

Finally, you tell Celestia that you want the callback to be called when a key is pressed, and then you wait for input:

&lt;tt&gt;
   celestia:requestkeyboard(true)
   repeat
       wait(10)
   until false
&lt;/tt&gt;

Note that the script has an infinite loop, so you'll need to use the escape key to terminate it.

Once you've got the basic script,  you can assign other new key functions simply by defining the Lua functions to implement them, and adding them to the key map.

Give it a try!



== Download the script ==
Below you can find the whole script (without comments) in a single text block. Copy everything in the grey box and paste it into a text file in your favourite text editor, and save that file in your scripts directory as zoomtofit.celx. Then open it (File/Open Script) from within Celestia to see the script in action. 

 -- Zoom To Fit function script
 
 zoomToFit= function()
   obs = celestia:getobserver()
   obsPos = obs:getposition()
   sel = celestia:getselection()
   if sel == nil or sel:name() == &quot;?&quot; then return end
   selPos = sel:getposition()
   dist = obsPos:distanceto(selPos)
   rad = sel:radius()
   appDia = 2*math.atan(rad/dist)
   obs:setfov(appDia*1.20)
   celestia:flash(&quot;Zoom to fit &quot;..sel:name(), 2) 
  end
 
 keymap = { z = zoomToFit }
 
 celestia_keyboard_callback = function(key) 
      f = keymap[key]
      if f then 
         f() 
         return true
      end
         return false
  end
 
 celestia:requestkeyboard(true)
 repeat
      wait(10)
 until false

----

===Distinguishing upper from lower case===

Unfortunately, the example above does not distinguish between the typing of upper case (capital) letters and lower case letters. 

When Celestia calls the function celestia_keyboard_callback, the function's argument (&quot;key&quot; in this example) contains the letter that was typed. A simple string of IF statements can distinguish among them:

 celestia_keyboard_callback = function(key) 
      if key == &quot;F&quot; then 
         zoomToFit() 
         return true
      end
         return false
  end

This form of the callback calls the function zoomToFit if an upper-case F is typed, but lets Celestia handle all other letters, including lower-case f.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use==
A semicolon introduces a pause greater than that of a comma but less than that of a period.

; To Clarify a Series : Semicolons separate elements of a series when the items are long or when individual segments contain material that also must be set off by commas. 

*Example: She leaves a son, Mike Nach, of Arizona; a daughter, Emily Rosa, of Colorado; and a sister, Sara Evans, of Minnesota.

; To Link Independent Clauses : A semicolon joins two [[Rhetoric and Composition/Types of Sentences|independent clauses]] within one a sentence without the use of a coordinating conjunction. 

*Example: The horse was due for an immunization; the veterinarian administered one today.
  
; To Set Off a Conjunctive Adverb: Semicolons are used, along with a comma, to set off conjunctive adverbs.  A conjunctive adverb is a [[Rhetoric and Composition/Parts of the Sentence|modifier]] that describes a relationship between ideas in two clauses.  Some common conjunctive adverbs are &quot;however,&quot; &quot;indeed,&quot; &quot;consequently,&quot; etc. 

*Example: I like pepperoni; however, today I ordered Canadian bacon on my pizza.

; Placement with Quotes : Semicolons should always appear outside quotation marks.  

*Example: Marcus often says that &quot;people should remain true to their faith&quot;; however, he is not a man of faith.

==Common Misuses==
Some examples of improper use of the semicolon:

*Between a subordinate clause and the rest of the sentence.  Example:  Unless you are coming home before your curfew''';''' don't bother coming home. 
*Between an [[English in Use/Commas|appositive]] and the word to which it refers.  Example: My favorite animal is a parakeet''';''' a type of bird.
*To introduce a list. Example: I own these cars''';''' a Dodge Stealth, an Acura RSX, and a Geo Storm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Malayalam is the native language spoken by the people of Kerala, the southernmost state of India, bordered by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

All Malayalam-speaking people are called Malayalis. Malayalam is one of the a classical language. Malayalam evolved from an ancient south Indian language, from which Telugu, Kannada and Tamil also evolved.

Malayalam has a very rich culture. Some of the greatest contributions have been made by Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan. The language uses 56 letters. Spoken language has many colloquial variations between the Southern and Northern versions. The name 'malayalam' is derived from the word 'mala'(hill). 

The name 'Malayalam' has a place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest name of a language which is a palindrome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">These small closed cylinders of soft metal are crimped over the inner cable end to prevent fraying/unraveling of the cable.
This is more important than it sounds at first,cables last longer and don't damage clothing as a fraying cable can. It may even stop a small but very annoying puncture wound on your calf. 
Sometimes these are provided with replacement cables - they are always fitted to new bikes.

=== Alternate methods ===

==== Soldering ====
A better solution is to use a soldering iron and some soft solder to the same end- simply heating the cable , &quot;wicking&quot; in some solder and then trimming for neatness.
With this method there is no possibility of it going astray- as crimp on ends can and do.

==== Spoke Nipple ====
A very cheap and effective solution is to use an old spoke nipple.  The nipple is slid over the end of the cable and crimped on with a sturdy pair of pliers.  Some pliers have a crimping area behind the pivot which works vey well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Slices ==

It seems to be that all of the discussion on indexing/slicing should be in one place.  Right now the discussion is split rather awkwardly between here and the strings section.  Within the list section we can just cover slice/index assignment. --[[User:Artevelde|Artevelde]] 09:27, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

==Length of a list==

Nice work, but how about a paragraph about
len(list), max(list), min(a)

== Why so few programming examples? ==

Almost all of the Python example code is shown as code that is generated from the interactive interpreter, but things that work there do not work in a Python script. For instance, from the Python documentation:

&lt;code&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana']&lt;br /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit = set(basket)               # create a set without duplicates&lt;br /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit&lt;br /&gt;
set(['orange', 'pear', 'apple', 'banana'])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

But if one enters the word &lt;code&gt;fruit&lt;/code&gt; on a line by itself in a script, you do not get output, you get a syntax error. Now you can use print to output the set fruit, but how do you use &lt;code&gt;sys.stdout.write()&lt;code&gt; for finer-grained control of output?

Programming examples would be a tremendous help, and more apt to be relevant to what the reader is trying to accomplish than command line examples.

== Code examples use the reserved word list ==

The use of the reserved word list is not really recommended. Is it not better to change the variable names from &quot;list&quot; into &quot;alist&quot;?

== Multiple 'for's in a list comprehension ==
&quot;It will evaluate the items in all of the objects sequentially and will loop over the shorter objects if one object is longer than the rest.&quot;

This statement doesn't make any sense.  Multiple fors in a list comprehension behave as if they are nested loops; in the example, 'pot' is looped over simply because it is the inner loop.  Changing the order of the statements would cause 'flower' to be looped over instead even though it is larger.

It would be more correct to describe the behavior of the example as being equivalent to the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; item = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; for x in 'flower':
&gt;&gt;&gt;     for y in 'pot':
&gt;&gt;&gt;         item.append(x+y)
&lt;/source&gt;

This algorithm generates very beautiful sounds, even if its idea is much simpler than that of other algorithms. It generates a perfectly looped wavetable sample which can be used in instruments. It easily generates sounds of ensembles, choirs, metallic sounds (bells) and many others.

This algorithm is public domain. This page includes some public domain C/C++ implementation sources that can be used in your projects or products.

This algorithm is implemented in [http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net ZynAddSubFX] in the &lt;i&gt;PADsynth&lt;/i&gt; module, which you can download to hear for yourself what beautiful sounds it is capable of generating. Before proceeding with reading this document, I recommend that you listen to all sound examples in the next category.

== Sound examples of instruments that use this algorithm ==

These sound examples are generated by ZynAddSubFX. All instruments' wavetables are generated by this algorithm.
These examples are grouped into two categories:

=== With Effects ===
In this category, some effects are used. These effects can be reverberation, phaser, etc. Mostly, the only effect was the reverberation.

*[[Media:Padsynth_example_bells_string_choir.ogg|Bells, Strings and Choir]]
*[[Media:Padsynth_example_synth_piano.ogg|Synth Piano]]
*[[Media:Padsynth_example_phased_choir.ogg|Choir with Phaser effect]]

=== Without Effects ===

All instruments in this category the instruments are &quot;dry&quot;. No reverberation, no other effects.

*[[Media:Padsynth_example_noefx_bell_strings.ogg|Bells, Strings]]
*[[Media:Padsynth_example_noefx_organ_choir.ogg|Organ and Choir]]
*[[Media:Padsynth_example_noefx_saw_piano.ogg|Saw Piano]] (this example contains the same notes played many times, but with different bandwidth and harmonic profiles)

== Description of the algorithm ==
In order to understand how this algorithm works, you need to be familiar with how the author of this text thinks about the musical instruments. Please read an introduction for the description of the meaning and the importance of [http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/doc_0.html Bandwidth of each harmonic and Randomness].
 
=== General description ===
This algorithm generates some large wavetables that can played at different speeds to get the desired sound. This algorithm describes only how these wavetables are generated. The result is a perfectly looped wavetable. Unlike other synthesis methods which use Inverse Fast Fourier Transform, this one does not use overlap/add methods and there is only one [[Wikipedia:Fast_Fourier_transform|IFFT]] for the whole sample.
    
The basic steps are:

# Make a very large array that represents the amplitude spectrum of the sound (default all values are zero)
# Generates the distribution of each harmonic in frequency and add it to the array
# Put random phases to each frequency of the spectrum
# Do a single Inverse Fourier Transform of the whole spectrum. There is no need of any overlapping windows, because there is only one single IFFT for the whole sample.

The ouput is the sample which can be used as a wavetable. In the next image, the steps are represented graphically:

[[Image:Padsynth_steps.png|400px]]

==== The bandwidth of each harmonic ====
The author of this considers one harmonic(overtone) as being composed of many frequencies. These sine components of one harmonic are spread over a certain band of frequencies.
Higher harmonics has bigger bandwidth. In natural choirs/ensembles the bandwidth is proportional to the harmonic's frequency.
Here is an example of a spectrum of an instrument generated by this algorithm:

{| 
| [[Image:Padsynth_bw2.png|250px]] || [[Image:Padsynth_bw1.png|250px]]
|- 
| align=center|Spectrum || align=center|Close-up of the spectrum
|}

The harmonics becomes wider and wider, until at a certain frequency, where they may merge to a noise band (as in the full spectrum image from above). This is a normal thing and I recomand to not avoid this by limiting the bandwidth of the harmonics.

==== The frequency distribution of one harmonic/overtone (or the harmonic profile) ====
This describes the function of the spread of the harmonic.
Here are some examples of how they can be spread:
*A special case is where there is only a single sine component inside the hamonic. In this case, the harmonic and the &quot;sine component&quot; are the same thing.&lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Padsynth_profile1.png]]&lt;br/&gt;Audio example: [[Media:Padsynth_profile1s.ogg|Single harmonic]] [[Media:Padsynth_profile1c.ogg|Complex sound]]

*Detuned. In this case there are two sine components which are detuned.&lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Padsynth_profile2.png]]&lt;br/&gt;Audio example: [[Media:Padsynth_profile2s.ogg|Single harmonic]] [[Media:Padsynth_profile2c.ogg|Complex sound]]

*Evenly spread inside the harmonic (all components has the same amplitude)&lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Padsynth_profile3.png]]&lt;br/&gt;Audio example: [[Media:Padsynth_profile3s.ogg|Single harmonic]] [[Media:Padsynth_profile3c.ogg|Complex sound]]

*Normal (Gaussian) distribution. The sine components amplitude are bell shaped. The largest amplitude is in the center of the band. This distribution gives the most natural sounds (it simulates a very, very large enssemble)&lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Padsynth_profile4.png]]&lt;br/&gt;Audio example: [[Media:Padsynth_profile4s.ogg|Single harmonic]] [[Media:Padsynth_profile4c.ogg|Complex sound]]

Of course, you can use many others harmonic's profile functions. ZynAddSubFX's  implementetation of the PADsynth algorithm offers many ways to generate the harmonic profile.
Also, it's very important that the harmonic must have the same amplitude, regardless of the profile functions/parameters and the bandwidth.

====The phases of the sine components of the harmonics====

This algorithm considers the phases of the sine components of each harmonics as random.

===Steps, input and output of the algorithm ===
====Steps of the basic algorithm====
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Input:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

 &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; - wavetable size. It's recomanded to be a power of 2.
     This is, usually,  a big number (like 262144)
 &lt;b&gt;samplerate&lt;/b&gt; - the samplerate (eg. 44100)
 &lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt; - frequency of the the fundamental note (eg. 440)
 &lt;b&gt;bw&lt;/b&gt; - bandwidth of first harmonic in cents (eg. 50 cents)
      must be greater than zero
 &lt;b&gt;number_harmonics&lt;/b&gt; - the number of harmonics.
      Of course, number_harmonics&lt;(samplerate/f)
 &lt;b&gt;A[1..number_harmonics]&lt;/b&gt; - amplitude of the harmonics

&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Output&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

 &lt;b&gt;smp[0..N-1]&lt;/b&gt;- the generated wavetable


&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internal variables&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
 
 &lt;b&gt;freq_amp[0..N/2-1]&lt;/b&gt; = {0,0,0,0,...,0}
 &lt;b&gt;freq_phase[0..N/2-1]&lt;/b&gt;
 etc...  

&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Functions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

 &lt;b&gt;RND()&lt;/b&gt; returns a random value between 0 and 1
 &lt;b&gt;IFFT()&lt;/b&gt; is the inverse fourier transform
 &lt;b&gt;normalize_sample()&lt;/b&gt; normalizes samples
 &lt;b&gt;profile(fi,bwi)&lt;/b&gt;{
    x=fi/bwi;
    return exp(-x*x)/bwi;
 };


&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
 FOR nh = 1 to number_harmonics         
      bw_Hz=(pow(2,bw/1200)-1.0)*f*nh;
      bwi=bw_Hz/(2.0*samplerate);
      fi=f*nh/samplerate;
      FOR i=0 to N/2-1
         hprofile=profile((i/N)-fi,bwi);
         freq_amp[i]=freq_amp[i]+hprofile*A[nh];
      ENDFOR
 ENDFOR
 FOR i=0 to N/2-1
      freq_phase[i]=RND()*2*PI;
 ENDFOR       
 smp=IFFT(N,freq_amp,freq_phase);
 normalize_sample(N,smp);
 OUTPUT smp

&lt;/tt&gt;

====The extended algorithm====

The differences between the extended algorithm and the basic algorithm are minor:
There is an additional parameter:
*&lt;b&gt;bwscale&lt;/b&gt;: that specify how much the bandwidth of the harmonic increase according to it's frequency.
*Also, there is defined a function called &lt;b&gt;relF(N)&lt;b&gt; who returns the relative frequency of the N'th overtone. It allows to generate detuned harmonics or even metallic sounds (like bells).
The difference between the basic algorithm is at the computation of &lt;i&gt;bw_Hz&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fi&lt;/i&gt;:
 bw_Hz=(pow(2.0,bw/1200.0)-1.0)*f*pow(relF(nh),bwscale);
 fi=f*relF(nh)/samplerate;
If the &lt;i&gt;relF(N)&lt;i&gt; function returns N and the bwscale is equal to 1, this algorithm will be equivalent to the basic algorithm.

=== Public domain C/C++ code that shows a simple implementation ===
I wrote some C/C++ implementations of the basic algorithm and the extended algorithm.
The &lt;i&gt;&quot;c_basic&quot;&lt;/i&gt; directory contains the basic algorithm, &lt;i&gt;&quot;c_extended&quot;&lt;/i&gt; contains the extended algorithm and the &lt;i&gt;&quot;c_simple_choir&quot;&lt;/i&gt; is the implementation of the basic algorithm to make a simple choir.
These implementations  are wrote to be easy to understood and they are not optimised for speed. You can test on Linux by running the &lt;i&gt;./compile.sh&lt;/i&gt; scripts. It's recomanded to have snd installed, to make possible to hear the results as wav file. Of course, you can import the results into your instruments, because the waves are perfectly looped (set the first loop point to 0 and the second to the end of the wav).
I put the source code under public domain, but it depends on [[http://www.fftw.org/ FFTW3_library]], so, if you want to use into your products, you must use your IFFT routines to avoid licensing issues of the FFTW library.

=== Public domain C++ class that implements the algorithm (ready to use)===
To be easy to use this algorithm into your projects or products, I made a ready-to-use C++ class. Only thing that you have to do, is to provide it an IFFT routine. Please read the header file for details.

The source code of C/C++ implementation is available [http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/doc/PADsynth/implementation/PADsynth_implementation.zip here]

Also, you can look at the C++ class here: [[/CPP Implementation/]]

==Tips and suggestions==

#Keep in mind that the resulting wavetables are perfectly looped
#When using the wavetables into instruments, on each NoteOn, start from a random position and not from the start. This avoids hearing the same sound on each keystroke
#You can use the same wavetable for generating stereo sounds, by playing the same wavetable at different positions for left and right. The best is to make the difference between left right as N/2
#Generate different wavetables for different pitches and use the one who is closest to the desired pitch
#Upsample or downsample the harmonics's amplitude array before running the algorithm, according to the fundamental frequency. In this case we need to set a parameter &lt;i&gt;&quot;base_frequency&quot;&lt;/i&gt; which represents the frequency where the array is left unchanged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;tt&gt;  Example: we have &lt;i&gt;A_orig[]&lt;/i&gt;={1,2,1,3,0,0,1,0} and &lt;i&gt;base_frequency&lt;/i&gt; is equal to 440 Hz&lt;br/&gt;Here are some cases:&lt;br/&gt;- A[] for 440 Hz: is the same as A_orig[]&lt;br/&gt;- A[] for 220 Hz: is the A_orig[] upsampled by factor of 2&lt;br/&gt;so: A[]={1, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 1.5, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, 1.5, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 2, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, 1.5, &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;, 0, &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;, 0.5, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 0.5, &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;(the original A_orig amplitudes are shown as bold)&lt;br/&gt;- A[] for 880 Hz: the A_orig[] is downsampled by a factor of 2&lt;br/&gt;so: A[]={1.5, 2, 0, 0.5}&lt;br/&gt;- A[] for &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; Hz: the A_orig[] is scaled by a factor of 440/F.&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if this idea is very simple, the resulting sounds are very natural, because it keeps the spectrum constant according to the harmonic's frequency and not to harmonic's number. This folows the point 4 from the document where I described some principles regarding synthesis.

==Conclusions==
I hope that this algorithm will be implemented in many software/hardware synthesizers. Use it, spread it, write about it,  make beautiful instruments with it. If your synthesizer uses plenty of samples, you can use this algorithm to generate many ready-to-use samples.

      <comment>changed &quot;abnormal&quot; to &quot;defecient&quot; for clarity, tried to explain why GI diet is useful in terms of blood glucose not just metabolic ability</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{diet}}

'''Low-GI diet''' refers to a diet that advocates consumption of foods with a low [[w:glycaemic index|glycaemic index]] (GI).  The glycaemic index measures the rate at which the body converts the carbohydrate in a given food to glucose (blood sugar).  A low-GI diet is useful for people with diabetes, as either their bodies' insulin production is deficient or their bodies are insulin resistant, restricting their ability to metabolise glucose. Thus a lower GI diet causes less variation in blood glucose levels which makes the condition easier to manage.

Low-GI diets have benefits for non-diabetics also.  A high-GI diet results in peaks and troughs of energy throughout the day, whereas a low-GI diet results in a good level of sustained energy.  Low-GI foods also tend to have a longer satisfaction period per calorie given the slow energy release, which is useful in maintaining a healthy weight loss/control diet.

It should be noted that, since the glycaemic index measures the rate at which the carbohydrate in the food is converted into glucose, it can be misleading for foods with a low quantity of carbohydrate. The carbohydrate in carrot has a medium GI but, since a carrot only is about 7% carbohydrate, it has a relatively small effect on the blood glucose.  For this reason, some people advocate use of the [[w:glycaemic load|glycaemic load]] (GL) instead, which is simply the GI divided by 100, times the quantity of carbohydrate (in grams).

Foods such as meat which have no carbohydrate have no GI. 

A GI of up to 55 is low, 56-69 medium and 70+ high.  Glucose has a GI of 100.

A GL of 10 or less is low, 11-19 medium and 20+ high.

== The Fourier Series ==

The Fourier Series is a specialized tool that allows for any periodic signal (subject to certain conditions) to be decomposed into an infinite sum of everlasting sinusoids. This may not be obvious to many people, but it is demonstrable both mathematically and graphically. Practically, this allows the user of the Fourier Series to understand a periodic signal as the sum of various frequency components.

== Rectangular Series ==

The rectangular series represents a signal as a sum of sine and cosine terms. The type of sinusoids that a periodic signal can be decomposed into depends solely on the qualities of the periodic signal. 

=== Calculations ===

If we have a function f(x), that is periodic with a period of 2''L'', we can decompose it into a sum of sine and cosine functions as such:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{1}{2}a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty\left[a_n\cos\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)+b_n\sin\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients, a and b can be found using the following integrals:

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = \frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^L f(x)\cos \left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;b_n = \frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^L f(x)\sin \left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

&quot;n&quot; is an integer variable. It can assume positive integer numbers (1, 2, 3, etc...). Each value of n corresponds to values for A and B. The sinusoids with magnitudes A and B are called ''harmonics''. Using Fourier representation, a harmonic is an atomic (indivisible) component of the signal, and is said to be ''orthogonal''.

When we set n = 1, the resulting sinusoidal frequency value from the above equations is known as the '''fundamental frequency'''. The fundamental frequency of a given signal is the most powerful sinusoidal component of a signal, and is the most important to transmit faithfully. Since n takes on integer values, all other frequency components of the signal are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.

If we consider a signal in time, the period, ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is analagous to 2''L'' in the above definition. The fundamental frequency is then given by:
::&lt;math&gt;f_0=\frac{1}{T_0}&lt;/math&gt;

And the fundamental angular frequency is then:
::&lt;Math&gt;\omega_0=\frac{2 \pi}{T_0}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we can replace every &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)&lt;/math&gt; term with a more concise &lt;math&gt;(n \omega_0 x)&lt;/math&gt;.

{{info|The fundamental frequency is the repetition frequency of the periodic signal}}

=== Signal Properties ===

Various signal properties translate into specific properties of the Fourier series. If we can identify these properties before hand, we can save ourselves from doing unnecessary calculations.

====DC Offset====
If the periodic signal has a DC offset, then the Fourier Series of the signal will include a ''zero frequency component'', known as the '''DC component'''. If the signal does not have a DC offset, the DC component has a magnitude of 0. Due to the linearity of the Fourier series process, if the DC offset is removed, we can analyse the signal further (e.g. for symmetry) and add the DC offset back at the end.

====Odd and Even Signals====
If the signal is even (symmetric over the reference vertical axis), it is composed of cosine waves. If the signal is odd (anti-symmetric over the reference vertical axis), it is composed out of sine waves. If the signal is neither even nor odd, it is composed out of both sine and cosine waves.

====Discontinuous Signal====
If the signal is discontinuous (i.e. it has &quot;jumps&quot;), the magnitudes of each harmonic ''n'' will fall off proportionally to 1/''n''.

====Discontinuous Derivative====
If the signal is continuous but the derivative of the signal is discontinuous, the magnitudes of each harmonic ''n'' will fall off proportionally to 1/''n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''.

====Half-Wave Symmetry====
If a signal has half-wave symmetry, there is no DC offset, and the signal is composed of sinusoids lying on only the ''odd harmonics'' (1, 3, 5, etc...). This is important because a signal with half-wave symmetry will require twice as much bandwidth to transmit the same number of harmonics as a signal without:

&lt;math&gt;a_0=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a_n=
\begin{cases} 
  0,  &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\
  \frac{2}{L}\int_0^L f(x) \cos(n \omega_0 x) dx, &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd} 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;b_n=
\begin{cases} 
  0,  &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\
  \frac{2}{L}\int_0^L f(x) \sin(n \omega_0 x) dx, &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd} 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Quarter-Wave Symmetry of an Even Signal====
If a 2''L''-periodic signal has quarter-wave symmetry, then it must also be half-wave symmetric, so there are no even harmonics. If the signal is even and has quarter-wave symmetry, we only need to integrate the first quarter-period:

::&lt;math&gt;a_n=
\begin{cases} 
  0,  &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\
  \frac{4}{L}\int_0^{L/2} f(x) \cos(n \omega_0 x) dx, &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd} 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

We also know that because the signal is half-wave symmetric, there is no DC offset:

::&lt;math&gt;a_0=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Because the signal is even, there are are no sine terms:

::&lt;math&gt;b_n = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Quarter-Wave Symmetry of an Odd Signal====

If the signal is odd, and has quarter wave symmetry, then we can say:

Because the signal is odd, there are no cosine terms:
::&lt;math&gt;a_0=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;a_n=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

There are no even sine terms due to half-wave symmetry, and we only need to integrate the first quarter-period due to quarter-wave symmetry.

::&lt;math&gt;b_n=
\begin{cases} 
  0,  &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\
  \frac{4}{L}\int_0^{L/2} f(x) \sin(n \omega_0 x) dx, &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd} 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Summary ===

By convention, the coefficients of the cosine components are labeled &quot;''a''&quot;, and the coefficients of the sine components are labeled with a &quot;''b''&quot;. A few important facts can then be mentioned:

*If the function has a DC offset, ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be non-zero. There is no ''B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' term.
*If the signal is even, all the ''b'' terms are 0 (no sine components).
*If the signal is odd, all the ''a'' terms are 0 (no cosine components).
*If the function has half-wave symmetry, then all the even coefficients (of sine and cosine terms) are zero, and we only have to integrate half the signal.
*If the function has quarter-wave symmetry, we only need to integrate a quarter of the signal.
*The Fourier series of a sine or cosine wave contains ''a single harmonic'' because a sine or cosine wave cannot be decomposed into other sine or cosine waves.
*We can check a series by looking for discontinuities in the signal or derivative of the signal. If there are discontinuities, the harmonics drop off as 1/''n'', if the derivative is discontinuous, the harmonics drop off as 1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Polar Series ==

The Fourier Series can also be represented in a polar form which is more compact and easier to manipulate.

If we have the coefficients of the rectangular Fourier Series, ''a'' and ''b'' we can define a coefficient ''x'', and a phase angle ''&amp;phi;'' that can be calculated in the following manner:

:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = a_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_n = \sqrt{a_n^2 + b_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_n = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b_n}{a_n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

We can then define ''f(x)'' in terms of our new Fourier representation, by using a '''cosine basis function:'''

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n\cos(n\omega x - \phi_n)&lt;/math&gt;

The use of a cosine basis instead of a sine basis is an arbitrary distinction, but is important nonetheless. If we wanted to use a sine basis instead of a cosine basis, we would have to modify our equation for &amp;phi;, above.

===Proof of Equivalence===

We can show explicitly that the polar cosine basis function is equivalent to the &quot;Cartesian&quot; form with a sine and cosine term.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n\cos(n\omega x - \phi_n)&lt;/math&gt;

By the double-angle formula for cosines:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n \left [ \cos(n\omega x)\cos(-\phi_n)-\sin(n\omega x)\sin(-\phi_n) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

By the odd-even properties of cosines and sines:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n \left [ \cos(n\omega x)\cos(\phi_n)+\sin(n\omega x)\sin(\phi_n) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Grouping the coefficents:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty [x_n \cos(\phi_n) \cos(n\omega x) + x_n \sin(\phi_n)\sin(n\omega x)]&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the rectangular series given that:

:&lt;math&gt;a_n=x_n \cos(\phi_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_n=x_n \sin(\phi_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{b_n}{a_n}=\frac{x_n \sin(\phi_n)}{x_n \cos(\phi_n)}=\tan(\phi_n)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_n = \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{b_n}{a_n} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Squaring and adding, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;a_n^2+b_n^2=x_n^2 \left[ \cos^2(\phi_n) + sin^2(\phi_n) \right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_n^2+b_n^2=x_n^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_n=\sqrt{a_n^2+b_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, given the above definitions of ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the two are equivalent. For a sine basis function, just use the sine double-angle formula. The rest of the process is very similar.

== Exponential Series ==

Using Eulers Equation, and a little trickery, we can convert the standard Rectangular Fourier Series into an exponential form. Even though complex numbers are a little more complicated to comprehend, we use this form for a number of reasons:

#Only need to perform one integration
#A single exponential can be manipulated more easily than a sum of sinusoids
#It provides a logical transition into a further discussion of the Fourier Transform.

We can construct the exponential series from the rectangular series using Euler's formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(x)=\frac{-i}{2}\left( e^{ix} - e^{-ix} \right); \quad \quad \cos(x)=\frac{1}{2}\left( e^{ix} + e^{-ix} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The rectangular series is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left[a_n \cos(n \omega x )+ b_n \sin(n \omega x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting Euler's formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left [ \frac{a_n}{2} e^{i n \omega x} + \frac{a_n}{2} e^{- i n \omega x} - \frac{i b_n}{2} e^{i n \omega x} + \frac{ib _n}{2} e^{- i n \omega x } \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Splitting into &quot;positive ''n''&quot; and &quot;negative ''n''&quot; parts gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left [ \frac{a_n}{2} e^{i n \omega x} - \frac{i b_n}{2} e^{i n \omega x} \right] + 
\sum_{n=-\infty}^{-1} \left [ \frac{a_{-n}}{2} e^{i n \omega x}  + \frac{ib _{-n}}{2} e^{i n \omega x } \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2} (a_n-i b_n) e^{i n \omega x} + 
\sum_{n=-\infty}^{-1} \frac{1}{2} (a_{-n}+i b_{-n}) e^{i n \omega x}&lt;/math&gt;

We now collapse this into a single expression:
{{eqn|Exponential Fourier Series}}
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_n e^{i n \omega x}&lt;/math&gt;

Where we can relate ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the rectangular series:

:&lt;math&gt;c_n =
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{2} (a_{-n}+i b_{-n}), &amp; n&lt;0\\
    a_0, &amp; n=0\\
   \frac{1}{2} (a_n-i b_n), &amp; n&gt;0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the exponential Fourier series of ''f(x)''. Note that ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is, in general, complex. Also note that:
:*&lt;math&gt;\Re(c_n)=\Re(c_{-n})&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\Im(c_n)=-\Im(c_{-n})&lt;/math&gt;

We can directly calculate ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a ''2L''-periodic function:

:&lt;math&gt;c_n = \frac{1}{2L} \int_{-L}^{L} f(x) e^{-i n \pi x / L } dx&lt;/math&gt;

This can be related to the ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' definitions in the rectangular form using Euler's formula: &lt;math&gt;e^{ix}=\cos{x} + i \sin{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Negative Frequency ==

The Exponential form of the Fourier series does something that is very interesting in comparison to the rectangular and polar forms of the series: it allows for negative frequency components. To this effect, the Exponential series is often known as the &quot;Bi-Sided Fourier Series&quot;, because the spectrum has both a positive and negative side. This, of course, prods the question, &quot;What is a negative Frequency?&quot;

Negative frequencies seem counter-intuitive, and many people would be quick to dismiss them as being nonsense. However, a further study of electrical engineering (which is outside the scope of this book) will provide many examples of where negative frequencies play a very important part in modeling and understanding certain systems. While it may not make much sense initially, negative frequencies need to be taken into account when studying the Fourier Domain.

Negative frequencies follow the important rule of symmetry: For real signals, negative frequency components are ''always'' mirror-images of the positive frequency components. Once this rule is learned, drawing the negative side of the spectrum is a trivial matter once the positive side has been drawn.

However, when looking at a bi-sided spectrum, the effect of negative frequencies needs to be taken into account. If the negative frequencies are mirror-images of the positive frequencies, and if a negative frequency is analogous to a positive frequency, then the effect of adding the negative components into a signal is the same as doubling the positive components. This is a major reason why the exponential Fourier series coefficients are multiplied by one-half in the calculation: because half the coefficient is at the negative frequency.

Note:  The concept of negative frequency is actually unphysical.  Negative frequencies occur in the spectrum only when we are using the exponential form of the Fourier series.  To represent a cosine function, Euler's relationship tells us that there are both positive and negative exponential required.  Why?  Because to represent a real function, like cosine, the imaginary components present in exponential notation must vanish.  Thus, the negative exponent in Euler's formula makes it appear that there are negative frequencies, when in fact, there are not.

=== Example: Ceiling Fan ===

{{TextBox|Another way to understand negative frequencies is to use them for mathematical completeness in describing the physical world. Suppose we want to describe the rotation of a ceiling fan directly above our head to a person sitting nearby. We would say &quot;it rotates at 60 RPM in an anticlockwise direction&quot;. However, if we want to describe its rotation to a person watching the fan from above then we would say &quot;it rotates at 60 RPM in a clockwise direction&quot;. If we customarily use a negative sign for clockwise rotation, then we would use a positive sign for anticlockwise rotation. We are describing the same process using both positive and negative signs, depending on the reference we choose.}}

== Bandwidth ==

Bandwidth is the name for the frequency range that a signal requires for transmission, and is also a name for the frequency capacity of a particular transmission medium. For example, if a given signal has a bandwidth of 10kHz, it requires a transmission medium with a bandwidth of ''at least'' 10kHz to transmit without attenuation.

Bandwidth can be measured in either Hertz or Radians per Second. Bandwidth is only a measurement of the positive frequency components. All real signals have negative frequency components, but since they are only mirror images of the positive frequency components, they are not included in bandwidth calculations.

=== Bandwidth Concerns ===

It's important to note that most periodic signals are composed of ''an infinite sum'' of sinusoids, and therefore require an infinite bandwidth to be transmitted without distortion. Unfortunately, no available communication medium (wire, fiber optic, wireless) have an infinite bandwidth available. This means that certain harmonics will pass through the medium, while other harmonics of the signal will be attenuated.

Engineering is all about trade-offs. The question here is &quot;How many harmonics do I ''need'' to transmit, and how many can I safely get rid of?&quot; Using fewer harmonics leads to reduced bandwidth requirements, but also results in increased signal distortion. These subjects will all be considered in more detail in the future.

=== Pulse Width ===

Using our relationship between period and frequency, we can see an important fact:

:&lt;math&gt;f_0 = \frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

As the period of the signal ''decreases'', the fundamental frequency increases. This means that each additional harmonic will be spaced further apart, and transmitting the same number of harmonics will now require more bandwidth! In general, there is a rule that must be followed when considering periodic signals: ''Shorter periods in the time domain require more bandwidth in the frequency domain. Signals that use less bandwidth in the frequency domain will require longer periods in the time domain.''

==Examples==

=== Example: x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ===

{{TextBox|1=Let's consider a repeating pattern based on a cubic polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt;f \left( x \right)=x^3, \quad -\pi \le x &lt; \pi \,&lt;/math&gt;

and ''f(x)'' is 2&amp;pi; periodic:

[[Image:XCubed Periodic (-pi, pi).svg|center]]

By inspection, we can determine some characteristics of the Fourier Series:

*The function is odd, so the cosine coefficients (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') will all be zero.
*The function has no DC offset, so there will be no constant term (''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'').
*There are discontinuities, so we expect a 1/''n'' drop-off.

We therefore just have to compute the ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms. These can be found by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over \pi }\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {f\left( x \right)\sin \left( {nx} \right)dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in the desired function gives

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over \pi }\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {x^3 \sin \left( {nx} \right)dx} &lt;/math&gt;

Integrating by parts,

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over \pi }\left( {\left[ { - x^3 {{\cos \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   + \int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {3x^2 {{\cos \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}dx} } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Bring out factors:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( {\left[ { - x^3 \cos \left( {nx} \right)} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   + 3\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {x^2 \cos \left( {nx} \right)dx} } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute limits into the square brackets and integrate by parts again:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - \left( {\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + \pi ^3 \cos \left( { - n\pi } \right)} \right) + 3\left( {\left[ {x^2 {{\sin \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   - \int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {2 x{{\sin \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}dx} } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that ''cos(x)'' is an even function, so ''cos(-n&amp;pi;) = cos(n&amp;pi;)''. Also bring out the factor of ''1/n'' from the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - \left( {\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + \pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right)} \right) + {3 \over n}\left( {\left[ {x^2 \sin \left( {nx} \right)} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   - 2\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {x\sin \left( {nx} \right)dx} } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying the left part, and substituting in limits in the square brackets,

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + {3 \over n}\left( {\left( {\pi ^2 \sin \left( {n\pi } \right) - \pi \sin \left( { - n\pi } \right)} \right) - 2\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {x\sin \left( {nx} \right)dx} } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that ''sin(n&amp;pi;)'' is always equal to zero for integer ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + {3 \over n}\left( {0 - 2\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {x\sin \left( {nx} \right)dx} } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Bringing out factors and integrating by parts:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) - {6 \over n}\left[ {-\left[ {x{{\cos \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   + \int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {{{\cos \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}dx} } \right]} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) - {6 \over {n^2 }}\left[ -{\left[ {x\cos \left( {nx} \right)} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   + \int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {\cos \left( {nx} \right)dx} } \right]} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Solving the now-simple integral and substituting in limits to the square brackets,

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) - {6 \over {n^2 }}\left[ { - \left( {\pi \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + \pi \cos \left( {-n\pi } \right)} \right) + \left[ {\sin \left( {nx} \right)} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi  } \right]} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the area under one cycle of a sine wave is zero, we can eliminate the integral. We use the fact that ''cos(x)'' is even again to simplify:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) - {6 \over {n^2 }}\left[ { - 2\pi \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + 0} \right]} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + {{12\pi } \over {n^2 }}\cos \left( {n\pi } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {{ - 2\pi ^2 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right)} \over n} + {{12\cos \left( {n\pi } \right)} \over {n^3 }}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = \cos \left( {n\pi } \right)\left( {{{ - 2\pi ^2 n^2 } \over {n^3 }} + {{12} \over {n^3 }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {{ - 2\cos \left( {n\pi } \right)} \over {n^3 }}\left( {\pi ^2 n^2  - 6} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, use the fact that ''cos(n&amp;pi;)''=(-1)&lt;sup&gt;''n&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {{ - 2\left( { - 1} \right)^n } \over {n^3 }}\left( {\pi ^2 n^2  - 6} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This is our final ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. We see that we have a approximate 1/''n'' relationship (the constant &quot;6&quot; becomes insignificant as ''n'' grows), as we expected. Now, we can find the Fourier approximation according to 

:&lt;math&gt;f\left( x \right) = {1 \over 2}a_0  + \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\left[ {a_n \cos \left( {nx} \right) + b_n \sin \left( {nx} \right)} \right]}&lt;/math&gt;

Since all ''a'' terms are zero,

:&lt;math&gt;f\left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {b_n \sin \left( {nx} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

So, the Fourier Series approximation of ''f(x) = x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;
f\left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\left[ {{{ - 2\left( { - 1} \right)^n } \over {n^3 }}\left( {\pi ^2 n^2  - 6} \right)\sin \left( {nx} \right)} \right]} &lt;/math&gt;

The graph below shows the approximation for the first 7 terms (red) and the first 15 terms (blue). The original function is shown in black.

=== Example: Square Wave ===

{{TextBox|1=We have the following square wave signal, as a function of voltage, traveling through a communication medium:

[[Image:General Square Wave (Odd, Offset).svg|center]]

We will set the values as follows: ''A = 4'' volts, ''T = 1'' second. Also, it is given that the width of a single pulse is ''T/2''.

Find the rectangular Fourier series of this signal.

First and foremost, we can see clearly that this signal does have a DC value: the signal exists entirely above the horizontal axis. DC value means that we will have to calculate our ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''term. Next, we can see that if we remove the DC component (shift the signal downward till it is centered around the horizontal axis), that our signal is an odd signal. This means that we will have ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms, but no ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms. We can also see that this function has discontinuities and half-wave symmetry. Let's recap:

#DC value (must calculate ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'')
#Odd Function (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0'' for ''n &gt; 0'')
#Discontinuties (terms fall off as 1/''n'')
#Half-wave Symmetry (no even harmonics)

Now, we can calculate these values as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T f(t)dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^{T/2} 4 dt &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = \frac{1}{T} \left[ 4 t \right]_0^{T/2}=\frac{4 \times T}{T \times 2}=2&lt;/math&gt;

This could also have been worked out intuitively, as the signal has a 50% duty-cycle, meaning that the average value is half of the maximum.

Due to the oddness of the function, there are no cosine terms:

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = 0 \quad \mbox{ for all } n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to the half-wave symmetry, there are only odd sine terms, which are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n = \frac{1}{T/2} \int_0^T f(t) \sin \left( \frac{2 n \pi t}{T} \right) dt &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^{T/2}4 \sin \left( 2 n \pi t \right) dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = -2 \left[ \frac{4}{2 n \pi} \cos \left( 2 n \pi t \right) \right]_0^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = -2 \left[ \frac{4}{2 n \pi} \cos \left( \frac{2n \pi}{2} \right) - \frac{4}{2 n \pi} \cos \left(2 n \pi \times 0 \right) \right] &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = -\frac{4}{n \pi} \left[\cos \left( n \pi \right) - 1 \right] &lt;/math&gt;

Given that cos(''n&amp;pi;'')=(-1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n = -\frac{4 \left((-1)^n - 1 \right)}{n \pi} &lt;/math&gt;

For any even ''n'', this equals zero, in accordance with our predictions based on half-wave symmetry. It also decays as 1/''n'', as we expect, due to the presence of discontinuities.

Finally, we can put our Fourier series together as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty{ b_n \sin \left(\frac {\pi n t}{\frac{L}{2}} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = 2 - \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^\infty{\frac{(-1)^n - 1}{n} \sin(2 \pi n t)}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same as

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = 2 + \frac{8}{\pi}\sum_{n=1,3,5,\ldots}^\infty{\frac{1}{n} \sin(2 \pi n t)}&lt;/math&gt;

We see that the Fourier series closely matches the original function:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thermodynamics is a misnomer since we will only consider ''equilibrium'' phenomena, not time-dependence like in kinetics. Thermodynamics deals with things like energy, entropy, volume, heat, work, efficiency (ideal), free energy, chemical potential, pressure, temperature. It was developed to explain steam engines back in the 1800's. It has come a long way since then, able to explain a vast array of phenomena in chemistry, physics, and biology. It is an old theory, but a beautiful one. It is ''very'' important in chemistry.

'''Sample problem'''

An ideal monoatomic gas at 1 bar is expanded in a reversible adiabatic process to a final pressure of &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; bar. Calculate &lt;math&gt;q\;&lt;/math&gt; per mole, &lt;math&gt;w\;&lt;/math&gt; per mole, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overline{U}&lt;/math&gt;.

To solve this, we need to apply the fact that
&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left ( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right )^{\gamma - 1 / \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.

So, substitute and solve for &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_2}{298.15\ K} = \left ( \frac{0.5\ bar}{1.0\ bar} \right )^{\begin{matrix} \frac{\begin{matrix} \frac{5}{3} \end{matrix} - 1}{\begin{matrix} \frac{5}{3} \end{matrix}} \end{matrix}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_2 = {225.96\ K}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we use

&lt;math&gt;w = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \overline{C}_v\, dT&lt;/math&gt;

Which will give us &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;w = \int_{298.15\ K}^{225.96\ K} \overline{C}_v\, dT = \begin{matrix} \frac{3}{2} \end{matrix} R \left ( 225.96\ K - 298.15\ K \right ) = -900.39\ J\ mol^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, we have all of our answers...

Adiabatic means &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overline{U} = w&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;q = 0\ J\ mol^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w = -900.39\ J\ mol^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overline{U} = -900.30\ J\ mol^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;


== The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics ==

This law of thermodynamics was developed after the establishment of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The zeroth law is involved in defining temperature.

Let us consider three systems, A, B, and C. If systems A and C are in equilibrium, and B and C are in equilibrium, then A and B will be found to be in thermal equilibrium when connected by a heat conductor. This associative property of systems is the zeroth law of thermodynamics.

The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two systems are in thermodynamic equilibrium seperately with a third system then both these systems are said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Gmail}}
'''Stars''' is one of many organization systems in Gmail.
==How to==

You might want to star messages for different reasons - to mark it as über-important, as a temporary filing system, or just for fun.  If you want to &quot;star&quot; a message, there are several ways that you can.  If you are in a mailbox view (i.e. &quot;Inbox,&quot; &quot;All Mail,&quot; &quot;Sent Mail&quot;), then listed on the very left of the subject line is a small white star - the easiest way to star a message?  Simply click on that star, and watch it turn from white to yellow, indicating the change in status from &quot;unstarred&quot; to &quot;starred.&quot;  One can also use this technique when viewing a message (noting that the subject line will have moved to the top of the page).  

If you want to star multiple messages, you can select them using the radio boxes (check boxes) and then select &quot;Add Star&quot; from the drop-down menu at the top of the page.

Unstarring is intuitive once you understand how to star - you can do it by clicking on the yellow star we talked about before, or using the radio boxes (check boxes) and drop down menu.

==Operator== 

You can use the operator '''is:stared''' in your [[Gmail/Filters|filters]] to avoid deleting your starred messages.</text>

== How to pronounce R in French? ==
The pronunciation is rather difficult for some language speakers. And I cannot find such sound in either English or my native language Chinese. Can anyone give more details on the pronunciation or give a picture of the position of the tongue?

== ==
I just noticed something after insterting the paragraph clarifying the difference in phonological terms on the the [[French/Lessons/Alphabet#b_and_p|English and French 'p' and 'b']]. I don't believe that the voiced labial stop 'b' is ever aspirated in English. In fact, the rule as [[wikipedia:Aspiration_%28phonetics%29|the wikipedia aspiration page]] states it (and as I learned it as well), is &quot;voiceless stops are aspirated when they begin a stressed syllable&quot;. 'B' is voiced and so it shouldn't fall into that category. But I'm not a native speaker and may not have absorbed the rules of English phonology that natives don't even have to think about. Tell me: is there the same difference between between 'pit' and 'spit' as 'bit' and ... well, it's hard to come up with an example. 'sbit'? But that's not a word. We need a word where the 'b' does not begin a  stressed syllable. The 's trick' that works for 'pit' and 'spit' (and 'kill' and 'skill') does not work here since I cannot think of a word with this consonant cluster (I don't think 'disbarred' works because it's syllabized 'dis-barred' and so the 'b' still starts a stressed syllable). Possibly 'dweeb' might work here for comparison with 'bit' since the 'b' ends the syllable instead of beginning it. Suggestions anyone?

I am a native speaker, and when I say &quot;spit&quot; and &quot;sbit&quot; I get the exact same sound. Although sbit isn't a word, I think it demostrates the point quite clearly. So, until we can find a word with an unaspirated B, I think it could be used. [[User:151.213.240.56|151.213.240.56]] 02:14, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

== Does &quot;ÿ&quot; and &quot;ö&quot; exist in french? ==

As french native speaker, I don't know any word with those letter modified this way... Maybe I am mistaking but are you sure they exist in modern french? --[[User:Lyndametref|Lyndametref]] 03:27, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

: The lesson on accents says, &quot;The letter ÿ is only used in very rare words, most old town names : L'Haÿ-Les-Roses (Paris surburb).&quot; Don't know about ö. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 04:20, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== ''b'' and ''p'' - pit and spit example ==

I'm having trouble with the pit and spit example, as I'm noticing said &quot;puff&quot; on the second word when the text says it shouldn't. Because of this, I'm not sure if the text there is correct, or if it's a normal method on how I pronounce English words - and as such, I might never meet the requirement of that exercise even if I'm correctly pronouncing &quot;papa&quot;.  --[[Special:Contributions/206.248.132.105|206.248.132.105]] ([[User talk:206.248.132.105|talk]]) 22:55, 14 January 2009 (UTC)

== Punctuation spacing ==
I'm looking for an authoritative style guide on French spacing of punctuation symbols.  I currently found one from Nova Scotia, but I think I need another style guide in order to confirm if this is correct under international French. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 16:22, 26 January 2009 (UTC)

== Usefulness of the h-section ==

Given the general irregularity of french pronounciation, i wonder if telling people about difficulties such as aspirated versus unaspirated h upfront is a good idea. Especially if the exercise is to lookup words in a dictionnary. Just say that as a rule, h is silent, and leave the aspirated bit for later. I'd drop this section, and reintroduce it whenever liaison is introduced, in a section like &quot;liaison and words starting with a vowel&quot;. In the current state, it is as if you introduced ''a'' versus ''an'' to students on their first english lesson, just because they learn how to pronounce the letter ''u''. Likewise, the section on french ''p'' versus english ''p'' seems a bit too frightening: you have to exercise with a piece of paper before you even see the first french sentence?

== Conjugation of habiter Lesson 1.05 ==

My version has tu habite. I believe it should be tu habites.</text>

==Overview: Advanced Topics==

Now that you have learned some of the basics of college writing, it is time to dive into the advanced topics of writing. The tools you have learned from previous sections will help you to be a more successful writer with advanced topics. There are many different reasons for which one writes. It could be for school, work, or even the community. The topics discussed in this section are writing for the humanities, sciences, and business. Each chapter will highlight the unique features that separate these genres and give practical examples of how each uses writing to achieve goals.

===Writing in the Humanities===
Writing in the Humanities includes theoretical writing, creative writing, interpretive writing, and analytical writing.  Each of these qualifies as writing in Humanities, but each uses a significantly different style.

Theoretical writing includes historical and philosophical writing.  This topic focuses on the ideas of past cultures and people.  It also includes writing about your own theories.
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=*Thomas Paine's &quot;Common Sense&quot;&lt;BR&gt; 
*The philosophies of Buddha&lt;BR&gt; 
*Einstein's theories on Nuclear Physics|caption=Sample Theoretical Writings}}

Creative writing uses a more imaginative approach and can include storytelling, personal expression, or even free association.  Poetry, song lyrics, short stories, non-fiction, and fiction novels are all included under creative writing.  In creative writing, there is more freedom for the writer to explore feelings or ideas.  Some forms of creative writing, like sonnets, do include formatting concerns or restrictions.  Creative writing is more concerned with personal expression than adhering to tradition, however. 

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=*A science-fiction story&lt;BR&gt; 
*A biography of what the US would have been like if it lost WWII&lt;BR&gt; 
*A story about your future life|caption=Sample Creative Writings}}

Interpretive writers do more than simply summarize the text they study.  Interpretive writing improves understanding by asking a series of good questions. The interpretive writer introduces their own ideas about a text, but they must always back up claims by referring to the text they analyze, or another appropriate source.

Analytical writing is much like interpretive writing, but also goes a bit further.  Not only will you provide information, but you will also analyze it.  This includes asking “how” and “why.”  You will need to take a critical approach to develop an understanding of the topic before writing about it.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Writing in the Humanities|This chapter]] will expand on the differences of theoretical, creative, interpretive, and analytical writing, and will share tips on how to write successfully while using those different approaches.

===Writing in  the Sciences===
Writing in the sciences focuses on informing the reader of new discoveries, and assisting readers in discovering truth through facts.  This form of writing should not leave anything open to interpretation by the reader.  Information should be presented with solid data given in detail.  Science writing is generally written in past tense and should be concise.  Common forms of science writing includes lab reports and literature reviews.

Writing in science includes two main categories: natural sciences and social sciences.  Natural sciences include pure science and applied science.  Pure sciences are life sciences, physical sciences, and earth sciences.  Applied sciences include medical sciences, engineering sciences, and computer science.

Social sciences focus on human behavior and societies.  Social sciences involve documenting actual events as they happen as with case studies.  Categories of social science include psychology, anthropology, political science, sociology, education, business, and economics.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=*  Story regarding global warming&lt;BR&gt; 
*  Story based on the research of estrogen&lt;BR&gt;|caption=Sample Scientific Writings}}



[[Rhetoric and Composition/Writing in the Sciences|This chapter]] will explain the distinct features of writing for the sciences.

===Writing in Business===

Business writing has a practical bent to it.  Writing in business often means explaining a situation, event, or change.  The author typically has a very specific action they wish the audience to take, and that action often contains time concerns as well.

Good business writing is concise and focuses directly on the stated purpose.  A business document needs to be organized in a manner that directs a reader's eye to the most important points.  A well-written business document should allow the reader to quickly scan for purpose, time constraints, and a contact person who can answer further questions.  

Writing in business can include: memos, cover letters, resumes, project reports, proposals, thank-you letters, emails, and business plans.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Writing in Business|This chapter]] will give you the techniques needed to build a resume as well as many important documents used in a business setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ToonTalk==
Ken Kahn invented and implemented ToonTalk and proposes it for children.  It is available for free from [http://www.toontalk.com the ToonTalk web site] to run under Windows on Intel-type architecture.  I don't know whether anyone has tried it on a Windows emulator over a Unix-like system.
===Type===
ToonTalk has fine-grained concurrency and arguably a declarative interpretation, as a concurrent constraint (logic) language.  Arguments are objects, not in the &quot;object-oriented&quot; programming sense of &quot;object&quot;, but in the more everyday sense in that if I hand you an object, I don't have it anymore.
===Execution Entry Point===
The programmer triggers execution by performing a manipulation.  There is no particular place to which this is limited.
===General Syntax===
ToonTalk's syntax is animation, as in cartoons.  The programmer takes on a persona and shows ''robots'' what to do by example.  The programmer (or a robot) can assemble robots into teams of robots.  Giving a team a ''box'' (an array/tuple container) starts a process.  Order matters in the team.  On each execution cycle of the process, the robots in sequence attempt to match a pattern (one pattern per robot) to the box.  The first match fires.

The programmer or a robot can put an object in a &quot;hole&quot; (compartment) in a box, or can take it out.  You may regard this as similar to assignment.  Holes can be empty.

A magic wand is available to copy things, and a vacuum cleaner is available to make things go away.

There is one reference and communication structure, consisting of bird/nest pairs (or families).  A bird flies to a nest, in the simplest case (it is also possible to have multiple birds fly to the same nest, one bird fly to multiple nests, or multi-to-multi, but for this description, I'll continue assuming the simplest communication).  When the programmer or a robot gives an object to a bird, the bird (she; all birds are female and all robots are male) flies to her nest and deposits the object there.  If there are any objects already on the nest, the bird puts the new object underneath them.

When a robot is waiting for an object of a particular type to be in a hole in a box, if there is in fact an uncovered nest in that hole, the robot waits until a bird should put something on the nest.  Then, the box appears to the robot as though the delivered object were there instead of the nest.  Consequently, you can pass structures (as boxes with possible nested boxes) with, in effect, parameters whose values are not known yet, represented as nests.  When another part of the program figures out what the value of the parameter should be, it can hand an object representing that value to the bird that flies to the nest in question.

You may regard handing an object to a bird as similar to assignment.

Actually, I lied; the bird and nest is not the only reference structure.  There are also &quot;sensor&quot; objects linked to other objects as their &quot;looks&quot;, and changes to one are immediately reflected in the other.  These can't be boxes, however, just text, numbers, or pictures.  I consider sensors dirty in the sense that assignments are dirty in Lisp and you can think of &quot;pure Lisp&quot; as a dialect free of this dirt.  However, the sensors seem to be necessary in ToonTalk practice as part of an output mechanism (animated &quot;pictures&quot;) that would be awkward to drive with birds; Dr. Kahn experimented with having birds as the only I/O and eventually switched to using the sensors.

===Comments===
The programmer or a robot can type labels on holes, birds and nests, and robots.  The labels have no effect on execution, but can help the programmer very much to remember what the holes are for in the design.  Also, the reportoire of objects includes &quot;notebooks&quot; on which it is common practice to write documentation as text pads placed on the left page to document whatever object is stored on the right page that follows.  A notebook as a whole can also be labeled.

===Variable Declarations===
A box has a number of holes.  You can put any object in a hole that is not already occupied.  You can also hand a &quot;rectangular&quot; object (such as a box, a number pad, or a text pad) to a bird.  The presence of the hole or bird could be said to constitute a declaration of a variable.  The logic behind such a thought would argue that you can think of putting an object in a hole as assigning a value, and so the hole represents the potentiality to determine that value, and that is what a variable fundamentally is; it's an entity whose value we may not know yet, but to which a value can be assigned once we have figured out what it ought to be.  From this viewpoint, the value of a bird could be thought of as the sequence of objects that will eventually be given to the bird.

On the other hand, if we choose to think of any object in ToonTalk that gets modified as two distinct objects, the one before the modification and the version after, then we can see the language as declarative and so of course there are no assignments nor variables to declare, except logical variables, and a bird/nest pair could be thought of as a logical variable.  When you extract the bird/nest pair from Tooly the Toolbox, you are declaring the variable.

It's a matter of viewpoint.

===Method Declaration/Implementation===
There is a &quot;toolbox&quot; (really a supplies box) available to the programmer and all robots in all contexts.  The programmer takes a fresh robot from the toolbox and hands it an example box.  Each robot sports, at all times, a comic-book style &quot;thought bubble&quot;, which reveals what pattern the robot would try to match (always a box) (a fresh robot has a thought bubble without any box in it; this is referred to as a &quot;robot without a thought&quot;).  The programmer (in this case, a robot can't do this) gives an example box to a fresh robot as just taken from Tooly, the toolbox (the tools all have cute names; the magic wand is Maggie and the vacuum cleaner is Dusty).  The animation then expands the robot's thought bubble to fill the screen.  It is populated with a copy of the example box, and with the toolbox, and with an image of the robot that is connected to the mouse as its cursor.  The programmer uses this cursor to act out what the robot should do every time it fires.  To finish up writing the method, the programmer has two choices exactly.  One is to hit the ESC key.  When the robot executes this action, the process of which it is a part continues in existence and proceeds to its next cycle of execution.  The other exit syntax is to pick up a bomb and explode it.  This destroys the process when executed.  Note that the programming session is not an execution, except in a limited sense that calculations on the visible objects will have their results evident.

After the programmer has thus specified the robot's actions (or body or tail as I would call it, thinking of the robot as a rule in a logical language), the programmer (or a robot, I think) can generalize the robot's pattern to the degree required by the software design.
===Scope===
Robots can manipulate the objects that are convenient to hand.  The robot finds these objects in its &quot;My Box&quot; and can temporarily put them on the floor.  &quot;My Box&quot; can also be manipulated (e. g. given to a bird).

Robots do not wander around.

There are three forms of action at a distance.  One is the bird/nest mechanism already described above.  The second is the spawning of new processes.  A third involves special &quot;sensor&quot; objects that have immediate effects on their remote correspondents; I don't like to talk about them; they're dirty.

When a robot or the programmer hands a message (any &quot;rectangular&quot; object) to a bird, after the bird delivers the object to her nest, the bird flies back, and it is possible to hand her additional messages, or to pass her off to somebody else who can do so (e. g. by putting her in a hole in a box and handing the box to another bird).

===Conditional Statements===
The only conditions are those that are checked by the robot pattern matching mechanism described above.  The body of a robot is straght-line code with no conditions, loops, or subroutine calls.  Thus no stack is required for execution, and the time to fire a robot is predictable and short.

Patterns can directly check object type (e. g., number, string, N-hole box (with possible pattern constraints on what can be in the holes), box generally without regard to number of holes, bird, empty nest) and can check for constant values of numbers and strings (thus a string can serve as a message selector).  To do magnitude comparisons (&lt;, &gt;), it is necessary to employ a balance.  The balance compares two numbers or strings that are on either side of it in a box, and a pattern can look for a balance in a given aspect of tilt (less than, equal, or greater than).

===Looping Statements===
Each process that does not blow up is always in a loop.  Recursion is also possible by spawning additional processes, which can contain a copy of the robot team that spawns them, or any other robot team.  There is no other looping mechanism.  In particular, as mentioned above, the body of a robot is staight-line.
===Output Statements===
Suppose you have been given a bird, and your understanding is that you are to use that bird as your output channel.  Then extract a text pad from Tooly.  While holding or pointing to the text pad, hit the backspace key to get rid of the &quot;A&quot; that is there (all fresh text pads have the single character &quot;A&quot; on them).  Then type &quot;Hello world.&quot;  Press enter if you would like to include a carriage return.  Hand the modified text pad to the bird.

There are also &quot;pictures&quot;, which can have robots on the back of them executing as processes and causing the picture to change appearence (including showing text) using sensor objects associated with the picture.  The programmer may thus animate characters.

The programmer can travel around the system and observe any process or object, and manipulate them besides.
===Containers===
The native container is the box.  A box is a linear arrangement of zero to 64K - 1 holes.  A hole can contain any object or be empty.  Note that a box can contain another box.  Boxes can be appended to each other or broken up.  The zero-hole box is possible and useful.

Note that a list structure can be built of two-hole boxes.  This differs from a Lisp list in that no objects can be shared between lists (except, in effect, birds and nests).

Note that processes can be used to contain things (every process centers around a single box, called &quot;My Box&quot;), and linked structures can be built up of processes communicating via birds and nests.

===Algorithms===
Algorithms tend to be recursive.
===Garbage collection===
There is '''no''' automatic garbage collection.  Each process (except the ones on the backs of pictures) occupies a &quot;house&quot;.  The programmer is responsible to decide when these are no longer needed and arrange for them to blow themselves up.
===Physical Structure===
The dynamic space for systems being run and modified by a user/programmer is called a &quot;city&quot;.  A city consists of a 2-d array of city blocks with streets and avenues running between them.  Four houses can be built on each block.  A helicopter is available to give the programmer an overview and to support quick movement around the city.  On entering a house (on foot), the programmer can observe the contents, which is usually a process.  A programmer can also leave objects around in houses (or even on the grass outside, but this is not very useful, as not all manipulations will work from there).  Processes are blind to whatever a programmer may have left in their respective houses, and an execution cycle of a process cannot leave anything behind, either (other than &quot;My Box&quot; and its contents).  When a process spawns another process, this is done by the robot extracting a fresh ''truck'' from Tooly (it looks like a toy truck) and placing on it a team of robots (a single robot is really a one-robot team, and there is no way to construct a zero-robot team) and a box.  As soon as the truck is loaded with both these ojects and is sitting on the floor of the house, it drives away.  Once outside, it grows to the size of a real truck (so it appears in the animation, anyway) and drives around looking for a place to build a house.  An invisible crew of house builders emerges from the truck and builds the house very quickly.  The truck then shrinks to toy size again and drives into the house.  The truck then disappears, leaving the team of robots to work on the box.

It is possible for the programmer to save a city on a Windows file, and to resume execution with a copy of that city.  It is possible for the programmer to export or import any object (the export format is XML).  There are long-distance birds that can fly over the Internet to different running instances of ToonTalk.  There are &quot;notebooks&quot; that hold copies of objects on their pages (which can include notebooks).  Every programmer has a principal notebook, which is persisted between ToonTalk sessions.  It is here that one usually saves robots as soon as they are defined.  These mechanisms, with the exception of the long-distance birds, are only available to the programmer by direct manipulation; robots cannot do them.  Robots have no access to a persistency mechanism except through &quot;foreign birds&quot; (not to be confused with long-distance birds), which constitute the interface between languages.
===Tips===
&lt;Please include tips that make it easier to switch to this language from another language.&gt;

It may be best not to have been exposed to other programming languages.

But some basic computer science still applies.  Recursion is still recursion, and data structures are still data structures.

If you want to program with a stack, you can make your own.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While technically not part of iLife, this feature on all Macs that came with an Apple Remote, lets you enjoy your media from your sofa.

==The Front Row Remote==
Front Row is a feature on some of Apple's latest Macs that lets you control certain functions of iLife from your sofa using a special remote. This remote is a curvy white rectangle reminiscent of the iPod shuffle and the now-defunct iPod mini. It has only six buttons on it: Play/Pause, +, -, &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;, and MENU.

==Getting around Front Row==
To show Front Row, press the MENU button on your remote. Your Mac desktop flies away into the background and four gargantuan icons rotate into place. Pressing MENU again hides Front Row and brings you back to your desktop, exactly the way you left it.

&lt;Describe the language, include a brief history if possible.&gt;
===Type===
Multiparadigm; execution is sequential but programming styles could almost hide the sequentiality.  Logical or dataflow variables are provided as well as shared mutable multi-assignment variables; however, the syntax for use of those variables differs so as to call attention to which the programmer is using.
===Execution Entry Point===
&lt;Describe how/where the program is started i.e. C++ main()&gt;
===General Syntax===
&lt;Try to give a high level description of the contents of a typical line of code. An assignment example may be appropriate such as
 a = b;
&gt;
===Comments===
&lt;Describe and show the syntax for comments such as
 // this is an inline comment.  Everything after the // is a comment.
Block comments are specified by a starting /* and ending */  They can span multiple lines.
 /*
  * this is a block comment 
  */
&gt;
===Variable Declarations===
&lt;Describe if variable declarations are necessary, and give examples of the different types, such as

declare i as an integer 
 int i;
two ways to declare i as an integer and give it an initial value of 0
 int i = 0;
 int i(0);
&gt;
===Method Declaration/Implementation===
&lt;Describe how methods/functions/procedures are declared and implemented.&gt;
===Scope===
&lt;Describe how scope is defined.&gt;
There is lexical scoping?
===Conditional Statements===
&lt;Describe the conditional statements in text and present
 code examples. 
(put a space in the front of the line to format as code)&gt;
&quot;if&quot; and &quot;case&quot; commands are primitively available.  Case commands permit decomposition of structures by pattern matching.
===Looping Statements===
&lt;Describe looping statements in English and present code examples.&gt;
Built in.
===Output Statements===
&lt;Describe how to output ''Hello world!'' including the new-line with or without a carriage return.&gt;

===Containers===
&lt;List containers or references to lists of containers available natively for this language.  List ways to incorporate containers if they are not native to the language.&gt;
 foo(bar=1, bletch=2)
constructs a transparent data structure.  The parts in lowercase are literals.
===Algorithms===
&lt;List algorithms or references to lists of algorithms available natively for this language.  List ways to incorporate algorithms if they are not native to the language.  Or, if not available, describe that.&gt;
===Garbage collection===
&lt;Describe whether the garbage collection is automatic or manual.&gt;
Is automatic.
===Physical Structure===
&lt;Describe how the files, libararies, and parts are typically divided and arranged.&gt;
Is developed and executed in an IDE, Mozart.  There are tools for modularization and source code management (?).
===Tips===
&lt;Please include tips that make it easier to switch to this language from another language.&gt;
===Web References===
&lt;List additional references on the web. Please include for what level reader the references are appropriate. (beginner/intermediate/advanced)&gt;

====Correction?====

Isn't 

 do k = 1 repeat 2*i until (k &amp;gt; 1000); 

supposed to be

 do k = 1 repeat 2*k until (k &amp;gt; 1000); 

with the variable k beeing used within the repeat statement?

=== Request of Discussion ===
I've decided to write some basic information about bit (1) strings into the main article and to put advanced information into a new &quot;special&quot; articel.
About my motivation:
* I think the main article should contain basic information which enables reader to read/write PL/I programs, it shouldn't by a huge collection of very special information.
* Simple boolean variables and NOT/AND/OR are programming fundamentals needed for programs more complex than &quot;Hello World&quot;.
* By my experience bit (n), n &gt; 1 and BOOL/ALL/ANY are useful but there are many applications programmers they never needed it.
Well, that's my point of view, I'd like to read how other people think about this.

      <comment>fix the PDP/postincrement myth (see dmr's c history page)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">''Note:  All assembly language sample code depends on the developing environment assembler and operating system.''
==Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11==
Here is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11 wikipedia entry].
===Type===
CISC
===Execution Entry Point===
On Unix, execution of a program would begin at the first word.  The Unix &quot;a.out&quot; format (assembler output) had a header, and the first word of the header, 407 octal, was a branch around the rest of the header.  By Fifth Edition Unix, the header did not actually get loaded in the execution image, so the 407 octal did not have to be executed; however, the &quot;magic number&quot; 0407 (octal) stuck as part of a.out format, even as the format moved to other computer architectures.
===Registers===
There were eight 16-bit registers, addressed by three bits in addressing modes in instructions.  Register 7 was the program counter and register 6 was the stack pointer.  Registers zero through 5 were general-purpose.  The stack grew downward.

Addressing modes included postincrement and predecrement.  A popular myth assumes these to be the source of the increment and decrement operators in C, but in fact those were inherited from B, which was implemented before the PDP-11 existed.

A consequence of the fact that the PC was addressed as an ordinary register, and of the inclusion of the postincrement addressing mode, was that you could load a literal value into a register (or send it to memory, for that matter) by having the literal follow the instruction in memory.

        mov (PC)+, R5
        177265

would put 177265 octal in register 5.  In the assembler (using Unix assembler syntax here), you could abbreviate this as

        mov $177265, R5

===General Syntax===
In the Unix assembler, a colon followed each label.

 foo:   mov -(PC), -(PC)   / copy this instruction to the previous
                           / location and branch there
        br foo             / branch to foo

Of course in the above example, the branch to foo would not have to be executed since the instruction before it is a (nasty) loop unto itself.

Instruction fields occurred on three-bit boundaries starting from the low-order side, so it was easy to remember some instructions and the addressing modes for programming in binary from the front-panel switches.  For instance, machine language for

        mov -(PC), -(PC)

was 01x7x7 octal, where I forget what x was but it denoted the addressing mode, predecrement, each 7 denotes the PC, and the 01 is the opcode for move (which means copy).  These field boundaries did not hold for the branch instructions, however.

===Comments===
At least one of the assemblers (the DEC?) allowed comments delimited with a semicolon to end of line. In the Unix Assembler the character &quot;/&quot; was used instead. &lt;ref&gt;Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition, Chapter 2 - Unix Assembler&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interrupts===
The processor status word (PSW) was addressed at a specific memory-mapped location (-2, I believe).  The interrupt vectors were in low memory.  An interrupt would push the return address on the stack, and something else, because the format for an interrupt differed from that of a subroutine call, because there was a return-from-interrupt instruction distinct from the normal return (from subroutine) instruction.
===Conditional Statements===
There were branches, which went to short relative addresses, and jump instructions, which could go to any address using any addressing mode.  Only branches could be conditional, in which case they would depend on condition codes set by a previous compare or arithmetic instruction.  I forget whether there was a &quot;branch never&quot;.  There was a &quot;wait&quot;, which would wait until the next interrupt, and a &quot;halt&quot;, which would give control to the console (if executed in kernel mode or on a machine without protection).

       cmp r0, (r1)        / compare the contents of register R0 to
                           / what R1 points to in memory (two-byte word)
       bne foo             / branch not equal, to foo
===Input/Output===
Devices were memory mapped in high addresses.  You could use interrupts or polling to know when they were ready.  There were several levels of interrupt (or bus request).

There was a graphical computer called the GT40, before raster graphics became ''de rigeur''.  It had a computing processor that was a PDP-11, and a coprocessor to do the vectoring graphics.  The graphic processor had its own jump instruction and would be put in a loop to keep the screen refreshed.  There were great lunar lander and space war programs.

User programs on Unix, of course, did I/O with system calls, which were trap instructions.

 stdout = 1
 .data
 msg:   &lt;Hello, world.\n&gt;
 .code
        sys write; stdout; msg; 14.   / is the length
        / don't bother checking for error or a write of less than
        / the full buffer.
        sys exit; 0                   / exit with an OK status

I'm not certain whether the exit status followed the &quot;sys exit&quot; as above, or whether it was in r0.

        clr r0
        sys exit

Since the arguments to system calls usually followed the trap instructions in memory, and the arguments often should be variable, and you can't write reentrant code if there are variables mixed in your executable code, Unix provided the &quot;sys indir&quot; call which could point to a system call in data space, which Unix would interpret as though it had occurred inline.
===Indirection===
&lt;How many layers of address indirection are allowed?  Show example code.&gt;

One layer of indirection, determined by the instruction.  You could index by a literal following the instruction.
===Physical Structure===
&lt;Describe how the files, libararies, and parts are typically divided and arranged.  Do they have typical file extensions in the various forms?&gt;

On Unix, assembly language usually used the .s extention (for &quot;source&quot;).  The result of assembly was called a.out unless you told the assembler otherwise, in which case the convention was to use a .o suffix (for &quot;object&quot;).  Typically the linker &quot;ld&quot; (for &quot;loader&quot;) would be run on a bunch of .o files to produce the new a.out, which you could then cause the execution of by just typing its name.
===Useful Commands===
&lt;List code and descriptions of particularly useful commands for this assembly language.&gt;

There were, in both the Unix and DEC assemblers, nonce labels.  Rather than make up a name for every label you needed, you could just use a number and reach it locally.

 1:    cmp r3, r4           / hit size limit yet?
       bge 2f
       mov (r0)+, (r1)+
       inc r3
       br 1b
 2:

In the Unix assembler, 2f meant 2 forward (the next &quot;2:&quot;) and 1b meant 1 back, and so on.

Jumps could jump farther than branches, but took up two words, so a branch was desirable if possible.  The assemblers provided a way to code a branch if it could reach and a jump otherwise.  You could write it conditional, in which case the assembler would output a branch around a jump if necessary (inverting the condition, of course).

      jle foo                 / jump to foo if less or equal
      jbr bar                 / jump or branch to bar

The PDP-11 ia one of the original mini-computers.  It was used in a huge variety of ways, from timesharing to embedded control as well as some desktop use.  PDP-11 is not a language per se, but PDP-11 assembly is a flavor of assembly.
This early machine's architecture influenced later microprocessors and because it affected the design of the machine native code, it also affected higher level languages.

The postincrement addressing also made it into the Motorola 6800.

The only reason you would want to learn the PDP-11 assembly language would be if you had acquired a working PDP-11 machine and wanted to write or modify programs running on it.  The machine, PDP-11, as well as every machine that ran it native is obsolete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The step filter updates its output value only if the input value changed by a significant amount, specified by the threshold input. Incoming values thus update in &quot;steps&quot;.

Sometimes a reaktor module sends out a lot of events with the same value, which you can't really see. In the case you want to trigger something each time the output changes its value, you have to use a stepfilter with a threshold of 0 to filter out the events with the same value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Reaktor}}
L3 is a loop-based sample transformer. You can modifying the sound of loaded loops using different sound effects using a step-sequencer. These modifications, which are grouped into patterns (from A to H), can also be sequenced. 

Each pattern consists of a number of step-sequenced sound modifications. Each step represents a 1/16 note. The sound parameters that can be modified are offset inside the sample, gain, panning, pitch, reversing a portion of the sample, rolling (stutter effect) a portion of the sample, and modifying the attack and the decay of the sample portion.

The ensemble can be separated into two big units, the sequencer unit and the audio unit. Roughly, these units are separated into the modules &quot;Seq V5&quot; (pattern sequencer), &quot;Editor&quot; (pattern editor/sound parameter sequencer) for the sequencer unit, and &quot;Engine&quot; for the audio unit.

=== Seq V5 ===

SeqV5 is, according to its comment, a sequencer built by [[http://www.lost-online.com|James Walker-Hall]]. It is the part of the L3 ensemble that sequences the patterns, and handles the pattern length. On the L3 panel, it is the top bar with the pattern names on top, and crosses underneath the activated patterns, as well as the bar and beats-per-bar scale value field on the left. It has no input port (except the mysterious inactive &quot;*&quot;), and outputs the pattern length in 96th (port 96L), the current pattern number (port #), the current position inside the current pattern in 96th (port 96P), as well as the same information in 16th, which isn't used in the L3 ensemble.

SeqV5 consists of 4 modules. &quot;Time&quot; handles the bars and beat-per-bars inputs, and outputs the length of the pattern in 96th. It somehow involves the number of voices of the instrument, which is locked to 32. The maximum number of bars is voices module beats-per-bar, which is kind of obscure. &quot;96P&quot; handles the midi clock information and the pattern sequencer, and outputs the current bar, whether the module is playing, and the position in 96th inside the active pattern. &quot;Pattern&quot; handles the pattern sequencer, and outputs the number of current pattern according to the information out of &quot;96P&quot;. &quot;16P&quot; transforms the 96th time into 16th time.

&quot;96P&quot; determines the current pattern and the sequences of pattern inside a macro &quot;Loop&quot;, which interprets the mouse-area messages over the pattern sequencer. The Mouse macro converts the 0-1 X coordinate of the mouse area to a value from 1 to 16, and passes the mouse clicks to the loop area macro. This macro catches the x-coordinate of the mouse on the first click, and merges this first x-coordinate with future coordinates (moving the mouse with the button pressed). These coordinates are sorted, and the resulting range is the active pattern range in the pattern sequencer.
The LLd and LSd outputs are used for the display of the selected range, while LL and LS are the actual outputs. They get triggered when a snapshot is recalled or when the mouse is released.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Feminism is a diverse collection of social theories, political movements, and moral philosophies, largely motivated by or concerning the experiences of women, especially in terms of their social, political, and economic situation. As a social movement, feminism largely focuses on limiting or eradicating gender inequality and promoting women's rights, interests, and issues in society.

Within academia, some feminists focus on documenting gender inequality and changes in the social position and representation of women. Others argue that gender, and even sex, are social constructs, and research the construction of gender and sexuality, and develop alternate models for studying social relations.

Some feminist scholars consider the essence of feminism as broader than male and female relations. It has been posited that the hierarchies in businesses and government and all organizations need to be done away with and replaced with a decentralized ultra-democracy. Some argue that the concept of having any central leader in any organization is a concept derived from the male-centric family structure (and therefore in need of reform and replacement). (See [[w:Anarcha-feminism|Anarcha-Feminism]] and [[w:Post-structuralism|Post-structuralism]])

Feminist scholarship is interdisciplinary, drawing on fields of study such as anthropology, legal theory, sociology, history, literature and media studies among others. Feminist Studies, Women's Studies, or Gender Studies may be their own academic departments at some universities, while at others courses that use a feminist analysis may be taught through other departments, such as any of those listed above or another department with an explicitly political bent, such as Ethnic Studies, LGBT Studies, or Queer Studies. There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not the needs of students and of the field are best served by teaching about women's issues, racism, homophobia, and other interconnected issues in departments specifically devoted to such study or as single courses through a variety of more traditional departments such as Literature, History, etc. &lt;ref&gt;Lee, Rachel. “Notes from the (Non) Field: Teaching and Theorizing Women of Color.” &lt;u&gt;Women's Studies on Its Own: A Next Wave Reader in Institutional Change&lt;/u&gt;. Ed. Robyn Wiegman. Durham: Duke University Press, 2002. 82-105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moallem, Minoo. ““Women of Color in the U.S.”: Pedagogical Reflections on the Politics of the “Name”.” &lt;u&gt;Women's Studies on Its Own: A Next Wave Reader in Institutional Change&lt;/u&gt;. Ed. Robyn Wiegman. Durham: Duke University Press, 2002. 368-382.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist political activists often campaign on issues such as reproductive rights, violence within a domestic partnership, maternity leave, equal pay, sexual harassment, discrimination, and sexual violence. Themes explored in feminism include patriarchy, stereotyping, objectification, sexual objectification, and oppression.

In the 1960s and 1970s, much of feminism and feminist theory largely represented, and was concerned with, problems faced by Western, white, heterosexual, middle-class women while at the same time claiming to represent all women through a theory of universal patriarchy and worldwide sisterhood. Since that time, many feminist theorists have challenged the assumption that &quot;women&quot; constitute a homogeneous group of individuals with identical interests. Feminist activists emerge from within diverse communities, and feminist theorists have begun to focus on the intersection between gender and sexuality with other social identities, such as race and class. Many feminists today argue that feminism is a grass-roots movement that seeks to cross boundaries based on social class, race, culture, and religion. Feminisms are culturally specific and addresses issues relevant to the women of each society, such as female circumcision in Sudan, or the glass ceiling in developed economies. There is an ongoing debate about the extent to which certain issues, such as rape, incest, and mothering, are universal, and under what circumstances feminists can and should intervene in other countries and form alliances with activists from other backgrounds, in light of histories of colonialism and globalization that can render forming truly helpful international projects rather difficult.

Over the years a number of feminist political parties have been formed. Although negative stereotypes about feminists are still quite common, feminism and women's rights are often subjects of mainstream or even conservative political rhetoric, as when Laura Bush used the concept of women's rights in a critique of the Middle East in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/22/world/fg-laura22|&quot;Laura Bush Emphasizes Women's Rights at Convention in Jordan&quot;, Los Angeles Times] accessed April 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The history of feminism reaches far back before the 18th century, but the seeds of the feminist movement were planted during the latter portion of that century. The earliest works on the so-called &quot;woman question&quot; criticised the restrictive role of women, without necessarily claiming that women were disadvantaged or that men were to blame.

=== Prior to 1850 ===
Feminist thought began during The Enlightenment with such thinkers as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and the Marquis de Condorcet championing women's education. The first scientific society for women was founded in Middleberg, a city in the south of the Dutch republic, in 1785. Journals for women which focused on issues like science became popular during this period as well. Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) is one of the first works that can unambiguously be called feminist, although by modern standards her comparison of women to the nobility, the elite of society, coddled, fragile, and in danger of intellectual and moral sloth, does not sound like a feminist argument. Wollstonecraft believed that both sexes contributed to this situation and took it for granted that women had considerable power over men.

=== Late 19th century ===
The movement is generally said to have begun in the 18th century as people increasingly came to believe that women were treated unfairly under the law. The feminist movement is rooted in the West and especially in the reform movement of the 19th century. The organised movement is dated from the first women's rights convention at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848.

Emmeline Pankhurst was one of the founders of the suffragette movement and aimed to reveal the institutional sexism in British society, forming the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Often the repeated jailing for forms of activism that broke the law, particularly property destruction, inspired members to go on hunger strikes. As a result of the resultant force-feeding that was the practice, these members became very ill, serving to draw attention to the brutality of the legal system at the time and to further their cause. In an attempt to solve this the government introduced a bill that became known as the Cat and Mouse Act, which allowed women to be released when they starved themselves to dangerous levels, then to be re-arrested later.

Other notable 19th-century feminists include, Emma Goldman, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Margaret Sanger.

The Feminist movement in the Arab world saw Egyptian jurist Qasim Amin, the author of the 1899 pioneering book Women's Liberation (Tahrir al-Mar'a), as the father of Arab Feminist Movement. In his work Amin criticized some of the practices prevalent in his society at the time, such as polygamy, the veil, or women's segregation, and condemned them as un-Islamic, and contradicting the true spirit of Islam. His work had an enormous influence on women's political movements throughout the Islamic and Arab world, and is read and cited today. Less known, however, are the women who preceded Amin in their feminist critique of their societies. The women's press in Egypt started voicing such concerns since its very first issues in 1892. Egyptian, Syrian and Lebanese women and men had been reading European feminist magazines even a decade earlier, and discussed their relevance to the Middle East in the general press.

=== 20th century ===
Many countries began to grant women the vote in the early years of the 20th century, especially in the final years of the First World War and the first years after the war. The reasons for this varied, but included a desire to recognise the contributions of women during the war, and were also influenced by rhetoric used by both sides at the time to justify their war efforts. For example, since Wilson's Fourteen Points recognised self determination as a vital component of society, the hypocrisy of denying half the population of modern nations the vote became difficult for men to ignore. (See: Women's suffrage)

The 1920s were an important time for women, who, in addition to gaining the vote also gained legal recognition in many countries. However, in many countries, women lost the jobs they had gained during the war. In fact, women who had held jobs prior to the war were sometimes compelled to give up their jobs to returning soldiers, partly due to a conservative backlash, and partially through societal pressure to reward the soldiers. Many women continued to work in blue collar jobs, on farms, and traditionally female occupations. Women did make strides in some fields such as nursing.

In both World Wars, manpower shortages brought women into traditionally male occupations, ranging from munitions manufacturing and mechanical work to a female baseball league. By demonstrating that women could do &quot;men's work&quot;, and highlighting society's dependence on their labour, this shift encouraged women to strive for equality. In World War II, the popular icon Rosie the Riveter became a symbol for a generation of working women.

The rise of socialism and communism advanced the rights of women to economic parity with men in some countries. Women were often encouraged to take their place as equals in these societies, although they rarely enjoyed the same level of political power as men, and still often faced very different social expectations.

In some areas, regimes actively discouraged feminism and women's liberations. In Nazi Germany, a very hierarchical society was idealized where women maintained a position largely subordinate to men. Women's activism was very difficult there, and in other societies that deliberately set out to restrict women's, and men's, gender roles, such as Italy, and much later Afghanistan.

Early feminists and primary feminist movements are often called the first wave and feminists after about 1960 the second wave. Second wave feminists were concerned with gaining full social and economic equality, having already gained almost full legal equality in many western nations. One of the main fields of interest to these women was in gaining the right to contraception and birth control, which were almost universally restricted until the 1960s. With the development of the birth control pill feminists hoped to make it as available as possible. Many hoped that this would free women from the perceived burden of mothering children they did not want; they felt that control of reproduction was necessary for full economic independence from men. Access to abortion was also widely demanded, but this was much more difficult to secure because of the deep societal divisions that existed over the issue. To this day, abortion remains controversial in many parts of the world.

Many feminists also fought to change perceptions of female sexual behaviour. Since it was often considered more acceptable for men to have multiple sexual partners, many feminists encouraged women into &quot;sexual liberation&quot; and having sex for pleasure with multiple partners. The extent to which most women in fact changed their behaviour, first of all because many women had already slept with multiple partners, and secondly because most women still remained in mainly monogamous relationships, is debatable. However, it seems clear that women becoming sexually active since the 1980s are relatively more sexually active than previous generations. (See: Sexual revolution)

These developments in sexual behavior have not gone without criticism by some feminists. They see the sexual revolution primarily as a tool used by men to gain easy access to sex without the obligations entailed by marriage and traditional social norms. They see the relaxation of social attitudes towards sex in general, and the increased availability of pornography without stigma, as leading towards greater sexual objectification of women by men. Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin gained notoriety in the 1980s by attempting to classify pornography as a violation of women's civil rights.

There is a so called third wave, but feminists disagree as to its necessity, its benefits, and its ideas. Often also called &quot;Post-Feminist,&quot; it can possibly be considered to be the advancement of a female discourse in a world where the equality of women is something that can be assumed—rather than fought for.

=== Recent activities ===
In many areas of the world women are still paid less than men for equivalent work, hold much less political and economic power, and are often the subject of intense social pressure to conform to relatively traditional gender expectations. Feminists continue to fight these conditions. The most high profile work is done in the field of pay-equity, reproductive rights, and encouraging women to become engaged in politics, both as candidates and as voters. In some areas feminists also fight for legislation guaranteeing equitable divorce laws and protections against rape and sexual harassment. Radical feminism was a significant development in second wave feminism, viewing women's oppression as a fundamental element in human society and seeks to challenge that standard by broadly inverting perceived gender roles along with promoting lesbian and gay rights.

In the Arab and Islamic world, feminist movements face very different challenges. In Morocco and Iran, for example, it is the application of Islamic personal status laws that are the target of feminist activity. According to Islamic law, for example, a woman who remarries may lose custody over her children; divorce is an unqualified male privilege; in certain countries polygamy is still legal. While not attacking Islamic law itself, these women and men in different Islamic countries offer modern, feminist, egalitarian readings of religious texts. In Egypt feminist gynecologist Nawal al-Sa'dawi centers her critique on the still-prevalent custom of female genital mutilation. Feminist groups in other African countries have targeted the practice as well.

One problem feminists have encountered in the late 20th century is a strong backlash against perceived zealotry on their part. This backlash may be due to the visibility of some radical feminist activism that has been inaccurately perceived as representing the feminist movement as a whole. Many women, and some men, have become reluctant to be identified as feminists for this reason. Outside of the West, feminism is often associated with Western colonialism and Western cultural influence, and is therefore often delegitimized. Feminist groups therefore often prefer to refer to themselves as &quot;women's organizations&quot; and refrain from labeling themselves feminists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some forms of feminist theory question basic assumptions about gender, gender difference, and sexuality, including the category of &quot;woman&quot; itself as a holistic concept, further some are interested in questioning the male/female binary completely (offering instead a multiplicity of genders). Other forms of feminist theory take for granted the concept of &quot;woman&quot; and provide specific analyzes and critiques of gender inequality, and most feminist social movements promote women's rights, interests, and issues. Feminism is not a single ideology. Over-time several sub-types of feminist ideology have developed. Early feminists and primary feminist movements are often called the first-wave feminists, and feminists after about 1960 the second-wave feminists. More recently, a new generation of feminists have started third-wave feminism. Whether this will be a lasting evolution remains to be seen as the second-wave has by no means ended nor has it ceded to the third-wave feminists. Moreover, some commentators have asserted that the silent majority of modern feminists have more in common ideologically with the first-wave feminists than the second-wave. For example, many of the ideas arising from Radical feminism and Gender feminism (prominent second-wave movements) have yet to gain traction within the broader community and outside of Gender Studies departments within the academy.

For example, Radical feminism argues that there exists an oppressive patriarchy that is the root cause of the most serious social problems. Violence and oppression of women, because they are women, is more fundamental than oppressions related to class, ethnicity, religion, etc. Radical feminists have been very vocal and active in influencing attitudes and state-wide school curriculum standards. Thus, it is not unusual for feminism to be equated with the ideas proposed by Radical feminism. Some find that the prioritization of oppression and the universalization of the idea of &quot;Woman,&quot; which was part of traditional Radical feminist thinking, too generic, and that women in other countries would never experience the same experience of being &quot;woman&quot; than women in Western countries did.

Some radical feminists advocate separatism—a complete separation of male and female in society and culture—while others question not only the relationship between men and women, but the very meaning of &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; as well (see Queer theory). Some argue that gender roles, gender identity, and sexuality are themselves social constructs (see also heteronormativity). For these feminists, feminism is a primary means to human liberation (i.e., the liberation of men as well as women, and men and women from other social problems).

Other feminists believe that there may be social problems separate from or prior to patriarchy (e.g., racism or class divisions); they see feminism as one movement of liberation among many, each affecting the others. In this section, we will explore some of the main schools of feminist thought.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Germaine Greer has stirred up debate all her adult life, identifying herself since the late 50s as an anarchist. The Guardian reported that the writer Angela Carter described her as &quot;a clever fool&quot;, while former British MP Edwina Currie called her &quot;a great big hard-boiled prat&quot;. Christine Wallace used the terms &quot;grooviness personified&quot;, &quot;anachronistic passivity&quot;, and &quot;hegemonic heterosexuality&quot; to describe her subject, to which Greer replied that Wallace was a &quot;dung-beetle&quot; and &quot;a flesh-eating bacterium&quot;. Stephanie Merritt wrote in The Guardian:

&lt;blockquote&gt;She has been in the business of shaking up a complacent establishment for nearly 40 years now and was employing the most elemental shock tactic of getting naked in public both long before and long after it ever crossed Madonna's mind ... She has repeatedly written about her own experiences of lesbian sex, rape, abortion, infertility, failed marriage (she was married for three weeks to a construction worker in the 1960s) and menopause, thereby leaving herself open to claims that she shamelessly extrapolates from her own condition to the rest of womankind and calls it a theory ... In part, her ability to remain so prominently in the public consciousness comes from an astute understanding and well-established symbiotic relationship with a media as eager to be shocked as she is to shock. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,1057077,00.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Greer was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1939, growing up in the bayside suburb of Mentone. After attending a convent, Star of the Sea College, in Gardenvale, Melbourne, she won a teaching scholarship in 1956 and enrolled at the University of Melbourne, where she acquired the nickname Germianic Queer, and graduated in 1959 with a B.A. (Hons.). She then moved to Sydney, where she became involved with the Sydney Push, a group of intellectual left-wing anarchists who practised non-monogamy. The writer Christine Wallace describes Greer at that time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For Germaine, [the Push] provided a philosophy to underpin the attitude and lifestyle she had already acquired in Melbourne. She walked into the Royal George Hotel, into the throng talking themselves hoarse in a room stinking of stale beer and thick with cigarette smoke, and set out to follow the Push way of life — 'an intolerably difficult discipline which I forced myself to learn'. The Push struck her as completely different from the Melbourne intelligentsia she had engaged with in the Drift, 'who always talked about art and truth and beauty and argument ad hominem; instead, these people talked about truth and only truth, insisting that most of what we were exposed to during the day was ideology, which was a synonym for lies — or bullshit, as they called it.' Her Damascus turned out to be the Royal George, and the Hume Highway was the road to it. 'I was already an anarchist,' she says. 'I just didn't know why I was an anarchist. They put me in touch with the basic texts and I found out what the internal logic was about how I felt and thought' (Wallace 1997).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While in Sydney, Greer lectured at the University of Sydney, gaining an M.A. in 1963 for a thesis on Byron. A year later, the thesis won her a Commonwealth Scholarship, which she used to fund her doctorate at the University of Cambridge in England, where she became a member of the all-women's Newnham College.

Professor Lisa Jardine, who was at Newnham with Greer, recalled the first time she met Greer, at a college formal dinner:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The principal called us to order for the speeches. As a hush descended, one person continued to speak, too engrossed in her conversation to notice, her strong Australian accent reverberating around the room. At the graduates' table, Germaine was explaining that there could be no liberation for women, no matter how highly educated, as long as we were required to cram our breasts into bras constructed like mini-Vesuviuses, two stitched white cantilevered cones which bore no resemblance to the female anatomy. The willingly suffered discomfort of the Sixties bra, she opined vigorously, was a hideous symbol of male oppression ... [W]e were ... astonished at the very idea that a woman could speak so loudly and out of turn and that words such as &quot;bra&quot; and &quot;breasts' — or maybe she said &quot;tits&quot; — could be uttered amid the psuedo-masculine solemnity of a college dinner. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,1057077,00.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Greer joined the student amateur acting company, the Cambridge Footlights, which launched her into the London arts and media scene. Using the nom de plume Rose Blight, she wrote a gardening column for the satirical magazine Private Eye, and as Dr. G, became a regular contributor to the underground London OZ magazine, owned by Australian writer Richard Neville. [4] The July 29, 1970 edition was guest-edited by Greer, and featured an article of hers on the hand-knitted Cock Sock, &quot;a snug corner for a chilly prick.&quot;

She received her Ph.D. in 1968 for a thesis on Shakespeare's early comedies, and accepted a lectureship in English at the University of Warwick. The same year, in London, she married Australian journalist Paul du Feu, but the marriage lasted only three weeks, and ended in divorce in 1973.

Following her 1970 success with The Female Eunuch, Greer left Warwick in 1972 after flying around the world to promote her book. She co-presented a Granada Television comedy show called Nice Time with Kenny Everett and Jonathan Routh, bought a house in Italy, wrote a column for The Sunday Times, then spent the next few years traveling through Africa and Asia, which included a visit to Bangladesh to investigate the situation of women who had been raped during the conflict with Pakistan. On the New Zealand leg of her tour in 1972, Greer was arrested for using the word &quot;bullshit&quot; during her speech, which attracted major rallies in her support.

In 1989, Greer returned to Newnham College, Cambridge as a special lecturer and fellow, but left after attracting negative publicity in 1996 for allegedly &quot;outing&quot; Dr. Rachel Padman, a transsexual colleague. Greer unsuccessfully opposed Padman's election to a fellowship, on the grounds that Padman had been born a man, and Newnham was a women's college. A June 25, 1997 article by Clare Longrigg in The Guardian about the incident, entitled &quot;A Sister with No Fellow Feeling&quot;, disappeared from websites on the instruction of the newspaper's lawyers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Marxist feminism is a sub-type of feminist theory which focuses on the dismantling of capitalism as a way to liberate women and states that capitalism, which gives rise to economic inequality, dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women's oppression.

Feminist theory (or radical feminism) emerged in the 1970s stating that modern society and its constructs (law, religion, politics, art, etc.) are predominantly the product of males and therefore have a patriarchal character. According to people who subscribed to this view, the best prescription for women's oppression would be to replace the patriarchy with a gender equal culture or to have a separation of the sexes. Some feminists at this time felt the emphasis on criticising a perceived patriarchy was too narrow and/or misguided and so there soon emerged feminists who began analysing women's situation from a class based Marxist/socialist perspective.

According to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations; that is, people's capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit.

Marxist feminists see gender inequality as determined ultimately by the capitalist mode of production and the major social divisions as class related. Women's subordination is seen as a form of oppression (rather than an illiberal discrimination) which is maintained (like racism) because it serves the interests of capital and the ruling class. Marxist feminists have also extended traditional Marxist analysis by looking at domestic labour as well as waged work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tori Amos (born Myra Ellen Amos on August 22, 1963 in Newton, North Carolina, USA) is an American singer-songwriter. She is married to her English sound engineer Mark Hawley, and they have one daughter together, Natashya &quot;Tash&quot; Lorien Hawley, born on September 5, 2000.

Amos was one of a number of confessional female singer-songwriters in the early 1990s and is noteworthy as one of the few modern popular music stars to utilize a piano as her primary instrument. She is known for lyrically opaque but emotionally intense songs that tackle a wide range of subjects, including sexuality, religion, patriarchy and personal tragedy. Some of her charting singles include &quot;Crucify&quot;, &quot;Silent All These Years&quot;, &quot;Me and a Gun&quot;, &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot;, &quot;A Sorta Fairytale&quot;, &quot;Professional Widow&quot; and &quot;Spark&quot;.

Amos has experienced limited chart success in the United States and the United Kingdom but has also enjoyed a large cult following. She is also known for making eccentric comments during interviews and in concerts.

At age 21, Amos moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music career. While there she managed to get several acting jobs, including a Kellogg's Just Right cereal commercial (for which role she beat out a then-unknown Sarah Jessica Parker). (Amos says that she got the job because she could actually play the piano, whereas Parker could not.) After playing a bar one night, she gave a ride home to a patron, who sexually assaulted her—an experience that would feed into her emotionally-charged song &quot;Me and a Gun.&quot; She also met Steve Caton, who played guitars on her albums through To Venus and Back (1999).

=== Starting RAINN ===
After touring throughout 1992 in support of Little Earthquakes, Amos went to New Mexico to write her second solo record, Under the Pink. It debuted at #1 in the UK and #12 in the US charts on its release in January 1994. It disappointed some critics, however, who considered it a step sideways rather than forwards from Little Earthquakes (but was voted among the greatest albums of the 1990s by Rolling Stone magazine some years later). In February, she began the &quot;Under the Pink&quot; tour. Four tracks were released as singles: &quot;God&quot;, &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot; (a #4 single in the UK), &quot;Pretty Good Year&quot; and &quot;Past the Mission&quot;, which featured the vocal contribution of Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. A limited edition release of the album commemorating the Australian tour included a second disc entitled &quot;More Pink&quot;, a collection of B-Sides.

Around this time an Australian tabloid managed to take &quot;up-skirt&quot; photographs of Amos during a live performance at which she was not wearing panties. Amos did not comment on this until eleven years later, citing it as her impetus to not return to Australia during a tour between 1995 and 2005.

Amos also contributed the song &quot;Butterfly&quot; to the soundtrack for the 1994 movie Higher Learning as well as a cover of the R.E.M song &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;.

In June, 1994, Amos co-founded RAINN, The Rape Abuse and Incest National Network. RAINN is a toll-free help line in the US which connects callers with their local rape crisis center. In 1995, Amos, duetting with Robert Plant, contributed the song &quot;Down by the Seaside&quot; to the Led Zeppelin tribute album Encomium.

Amos performed a highly publicized television concert called &quot;The Concert for RAINN&quot; in late 1996. This coincided with &quot;National RAINN Day&quot;, and during the concert all cable and network television stations aired Amos' public service announcement about the organization. During this concert Amos performed a song with her friend Maynard James Keenan of the band Tool. During this year she also co-wrote/performed a song called &quot;It Might Hurt a Little Bit&quot; with singer Michael Stipe of the band R.E.M.. It was intended for the soundtrack to the film Don Juan DeMarco but was not used and has never been released.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN) in the United States is a toll-free, confidential and anonymous provider of counseling to victims of rape and sexual assault.

RAINN was founded in 1994 by Scott Berkowitz, the organization's president. RAINN has attracted the attention of many celebrities, notably singer Tori Amos, who contributed a portion of the initial funding. She has remained their most avid spokesperson and a great deal of the attention brought to the organization comes from her fanbase. Some of the funding to RAINN comes from the &quot;Happy Birthday, Tori&quot; parties; a series of fundraising events held throughout the world on (or around) the date of Amos' birthday.

RAINN's phone number is 1.800.656.HOPE.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conflict Defined ==
Conflict can exist between factions or groups within a team, with a leader or manager, and with other teams or departments within the company. It has been defined in numerously different ways and has come to hold several connotations. The following is an example of a relatively broad dictionary entry, where '''''conflict''''' is defined in the following way(s):
 
'''con·flict'''      
'''1'''. to come into collision or disagreement; be contradictory, at variance, or in opposition; clash: The account of one eyewitness conflicted with that of the other. My class conflicts with my going to the concert.  
'''2'''. to fight or contend; do battle.  
'''3'''. a fight, battle, or struggle, esp. a prolonged struggle; strife.  
'''4'''. controversy; quarrel: conflicts between parties.

===&lt;u&gt;'''Conflict in Groups and Teams'''&lt;/u&gt;===

Conflict inevitably arises in one form or another in varying degrees due to the mere group and/or team dynamics of having people with differing backgrounds, ideas, and potential agendas coming together in an effort to accomplish a common goal. Conflict is generally considered to be negative and something to be avoided. Numerous frameworks such as LaFasto and Larson's CONNECT model have been developed to help rid groups of negative conflict. However, conflict isn’t always negative and there are circumstances in which positive conflict is necessary in order to prevent compliance tendencies and the potentially disastrous effects of [[w:Groupthink|''groupthink'']]. 

In the following sections, the positive and negative realms of conflict will be outlined and further detailed in an effort to narrow the scope of conflict while helping to navigate some of the more negative connotations that easily come to mind when thinking about conflict. Use all positive words and actions and you will get the same back, respect others and they will respect you.

== Types of Conflict that a Team Can Face ==

'''''Positive conflict''' vs '''Negative conflict'''''

==='''Positive conflict'''===

Positive conflict is the notion that a healthy discourse may  exist in the disagreement among group members regarding personality traits, styles, or characteristics or the content of their ideas, decisions or task processes which involves a  pathway towards resolution. Any tolerable amount of conflict is vital to group success in order to avoid groupthink and to generate more innovative ideas among potentially and vastly differing members of the group. In addition, positive conflict generates buy-in and offers elements of ownership and a sense of cooperation and enhanced membership to all of the group members. Positive conflict reduces the effects of conformity pressures and groupthink. Groupthink occurs when conformity and compliance pressures are exaggerated, and it generally occurs in the absence of task conflict. One of the most devastating examples of groupthink occurred on the morning of January 28th, 1986 in which the [[w:Challenger_space_shuttle|Challenger space shuttle]] exploded  over the Atlantic Ocean after the failure of an O-ring. This failure resulted from the O-ring being unable to withstand extreme temperatures in which the O-ring had never been truly tested.  Numerous NASA staff members were aware of the possible failure of the O-ring in extreme temperatures, and they were also aware of the ramifications should the O-ring break. However, the decision making process regarding whether or not the shuttle was safe to launch was riddled with flaws that ultimately created a breeding ground for groupthink. To illustrate, the Challenger launch had been postponed several times before this scheduled date, and there was direct pressure from NASA to approve the launch. There was also media pressure as they were scheduled to film the launch, since it would be the first time a teacher was sent into space. NASA officials feared public ridicule if the launch was delayed again, and as early as six days prior to the launch, NASA put the pressure on. They told the inspectors to stop thinking like inspectors and start thinking like managers, and they rationalized that there was no conclusive evidence to suggest that the O-ring would not work. As a result, the inspectors bowed to conformity pressures and gave the approval to launch. The resulting launch and subsequent death of all 7 crew members aboard the Challenger shook the nation and was not the front page news that NASA had hoped for.
[[Image:Challenger explosion.jpg|none|thumb|400px]]
Other disasters that occurred due to conformity pressures include the Bay of Pigs, the Tenerife plane crash disaster, the holocaust, and many others. To test how strong the effects of conformity pressures are on less cohesive groups and among individuals that were only recently introduced, [[w:Asch_conformity_experiments|Solomon Asch]] conducted his famous conformity experiment in which  a group of random participants were shown a picture of the following lines, and they were asked which line in the second group of lines is approximately the same height as the first line shown.

[[Image:Asch_experiment.png|thumb|300px|Example of the cards shown to the participants of the study]]

Individuals that were a part of the experiment (confederates to the experiment) selected an obviously inappropriate line such as line “B” as their answer. The results were astounding in which the remaining individual in the group (not a confederate to the experiment) also selected line “B” as their answer due to perceived pressures to conform.  Conformity occurs as a result of individuals’ desire to be liked and their need to be right. Therefore, they tend to fall victim to [[w:false_consensus_effect|false consensus bias]]es and generally bring their behavior in line with the group’s expectations and beliefs. So how are you to know if your group is falling prey to conformity pressures and groupthink? Here are some common symptoms: 

:*Illusions of invulnerability
:*Rationalization &amp; justification
:*Illusion of group morality
:*Stereotyping the out-group as weaker, evil, or stupid
:*Direct or indirect peer or supervisory pressures
:*Self-censorship by team members
:*Illusions of unanimity

First, realizing that you and your group are affected by or susceptible to conformity pressures and groupthink is very important. Next, in order to create a norm of conflict, it is essential that a feeling of psychology safety is present. This can be instated by encouraging objections, criticisms, and altering perspectives. Also, as a leader, one should avoid making clear statements about your preferences, create subgroups, have outside experts come in to observe the decision making process, and re-examine the next best alternatives once a decision has been reached. Finally, limiting the size of the group and assigning roles that make conflict commonplace (such as a “[[w:Devil%27s_advocate|Devil’s Advocate]]”) will help to discourage and minimize compliance pressures.  After the Challenger explosion, NASA took similar steps to avoid future disasters in which they instituted a verbal and video recorded affirmation from several NASA officials that certify flight readiness. Furthermore, NASA's managers instituted a veto policy in which anyone at any level is given the authority to stop the flight process. 

In addition to avoiding groupthink and conformity pressures, positive conflict is more likely to generate a sense of membership, involvement, and enthusiasm from all group members and is also more likely to lead to the infusion of more creative and innovative ideas. This results from each team member having the opportunity to voice his or her own perspective on the issues being decided by the group. When individuals feel more involved in the decision making process, they are more likely to state a high satisfaction level with their team and are additionally more likely to want to continue working as a member of that team. 

Creating a [[w:Heterogeneous|heterogeneous]] team is another way to encourage diverse perspectives, opinions, and ideas. Heterogeneous groups also have a broader knowledge base resulting from a variety of experiences, backgrounds, skills, and achievements. Comparable to other investment strategies that are somewhat more risky (in terms of the increased likelihood for ensuing conflict levels), diverse teams stand a greater chance for potential return and favorable results as well.

==='''Negative conflict'''===

[[Image:Soc-psy_intergroup.gif|thumb|500px|right|Interactions]]
In diverse and heterogeneous teams, negative conflict has a tendency to emerge in varying degrees due to the mere dynamics of having diverse individuals with differing backgrounds, ideas, and potential agendas coming together. Negative conflict can arise in several different arenas including the following: 
:*Conflict can arise between factions or groups within a team.
::*Subgroups, or factions, can develop within a team. Each group has their own opinions and will stick together and oppose other factions within the team. Organizations can be greatly divided by such factions
:*Conflict can develop between team members and the leader of the team. 
::*Team members can disagree with the team leader. This can lead to refusal to follow the direction of the team leader. There may be conflict with management because management has not given clear goals to the team or may not be supporting the team. The organization could have a culture that does not allow teams to work effectively. 

:*Conflict can form between the different teams or departments in the organization. 

Unlike positive conflict, negative conflict is better if  avoided and must be swiftly addressed and resolved when it does present itself. Due to the dangerous nature and destructive effects negative conflict has on productivity and moral, it may potentially lead to Human Resource Management issues or even a lawsuit. In order to set the stage so that interpersonal conflict is avoided or at least minimized, firms can prevent the establishment of in-groups and out-groups, foster open communication and trust, understand the various personality styles that comprise a group, and coach effective communication skills and perspective taking skills to team members. 

An example of a firm, where the formation of in-groups and out-groups fostered so much negative conflict, was the Lehman Brothers firm, this in-group and out-group culture lead to the selling of the firm. Within this firm, a strong separation between Traders and Bankers literally divided the corporation and led to its ultimate demise. Differences between the functions were exaggerated and there was a perception that each of the divisions was pursuing its own unique and more valuable objectives. There was not a unified vision within the company and personality conflict was commonplace. The Traders believed that the Bankers were lazy &quot;Ivy League&quot; graduates who were awarded greater benefits simply to uphold the status-quo. The Bankers perceived the Brokers as less intelligent, blue collar workers who deserved less compensation and rewards.  Creating in-groups and out-groups in a company leads to an unhealthy competition between the groups. Each faction ends up battling for a greater share of the company’s limited resources and an “us” vs. “them” rational emerges, while energy is wasted on trying to prove which group is better rather than to maintain common goals. As demonstrated by the infamous Robbers Cave Experiment conducted by Muzafer Sherif, working toward a common goal and maintaining common purpose is essential for group unity and contributes to the reduction of personal conflict. In this experiment, 22 boy scouts were assigned to two separate camps and neither group was aware of the other's existence. Each boy formed a strong identification with his own group, and the scouts were even allowed to select a group name. The first contact between the two groups was to play a competitive sport and friction emerged between the groups almost immediately. During the resolution phase of the experiment, a task was developed in which the two groups were forced to cooperate and work together toward achieving a common purpose that neither group could achieve alone. A broken-down truck that needed to be towed back to the camp was staged, and the two groups had to combine their man-power to tow the truck. By the end of the experiment, the in-groups and out-groups had merged, and the entire group even insisted upon riding back home on the same bus together. In addition to forming a super-ornate goal for group members to achieve, pointing out what group members have in common and defusing stereotypes is a way to prevent the formation of an out-group. 

Fostering support, trust, and open communication is also essential if relationship conflicts are to be reduced and quickly resolved. Open communication can be established by the following: 

:*'''Establish ground rules.'''
::*Take turns when talking and do not interrupt. Ensure that each team member has equal time when stating their perspective. Listen for something new and say bring something new to the discussion. Avoid restating the facts and “talking in circles.” Avoid power plays and eliminate status or titles from the discussion
:*'''Listen compassionately'''  
::*Avoid thinking of a counterargument while the other person is speaking. Listen to the other person’s perspective rather than listening to your own thoughts. Don’t make an effort to remember points.
:*'''Point out the advantages of resolving the conflict.'''
:*'''Maintain a neutral vantage point and be willing to be persuaded.'''
:*'''Avoid all-or-none statements such as “always” and “never” and point out exceptions when these statements are used.'''
::*(IE: What does it look like when Marketing does consult sales before acting?)
:*'''Create a goal of discovery rather than of winning or persuading.'''
:*'''Be alert to common goals and where goals overlap as each party is communicating their perspective.'''
:*'''Use clarifying statements to ensure the other party feels understood and listened to such as, “What I heard you say is that you feel unappreciated and that you lack vital feedback to help you perform, is this correct?”'''
:*'''Help team members to separate the problem from the person.''' 
:*'''Use techniques such as role-playing, putting oneself in the competitor’s shoes, or conducting war games. Such techniques create fresh perspectives and engage team members.'''
:*'''Team members should recognize each other for having expressed his view and feelings.'''
::*Thanking one another recognizes the personal risk the individual took in breaking from group think and should be viewed as an expression of trust and commitment toward the team.
:*'''Help each team member to understand one anothers' perspective, and help them to re-frame the situation.
::*The exact same situation can often be viewed differently by several individuals. To illustrate, what did you see first in the picture below, the young woman or the old woman?

[[Image:Youngoldwoman.jpg|thumb|200px|Which do you see?]]

Once a team has received coaching on how to communicate effectively, address conflict situations immediately as they arise. Letting tense situations fester will only allow time for animosity to polarize and grow.  Helping team members to reframe the problem and see it from the other individual’s perspective can also be accomplished directly, via cross-training and job shadowing which allows each team member to draw from a frame of reference by walking in the other team member's shoes.  Utilizing the [http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/ Big 5 personality test] descriptions will also add an element of understanding to the group dynamic. To illustrate, if Jimmy is highly extroverted, neurotic, and conscientious, it may help Tim, who is not quite as extroverted as than Jim and who is more agreeable, to understand where Jimmy’s seemingly endless ability to voice his irritation with others is stemming from, and he may not take it as personally. In addition, Jimmy may better understand and get less irritated with Tim’s perceived inability to take initiative and make decisions efficiently. 

Finally, understanding common stereotypes and mental shortcuts that are used when passing judgment on others will make team members more aware of how these shortcuts are leading to bias conclusions. The common cognitive biases and a brief description are as follows: 

:*[[w:Self_fulfilling_prophecy|Self Fulfilling Prophecy]]: the tendency to engage in behaviors that elicit results which will (consciously or subconsciously) confirm our beliefs.

:*[[w:Halo_effect|Halo Effect]]: the tendency for a person's positive or negative traits to &quot;spill over&quot; from one area of their personality to another in others' perceptions of them

:*[[w:Primacy_effect|Primacy Effect]]: the tendency to weigh initial events more than subsequent events.

:*[[w:Primacy_effect|Recency Effect]]: the tendency to weigh recent events more than earlier events

:*[[w:Availability_heuristic|Availability Heuristic]]: a biased prediction, due to the tendency to focus on the most salient and emotionally-charged outcome.

:*[[w:Selective_perception|Selective Perception]]: selectively attend to data that supports your conclusion while omitting valid evidence that does not. 

:*[[w:Actor-observer_bias|Actor-Observer Bias]]: the tendency for explanations for other individual's behaviors to overemphasize the influence of their personality and underemphasize the influence of their situation. This is coupled with the opposite tendency for the self in that one's explanations for their own behaviors overemphasize their situation and underemphasize the influence of their personality.

:*[[w:Hindsight_Bias|Hindsight Bias]]: sometimes called the &quot;I-knew-it-all-along&quot; effect, the inclination to see past events as being predictable.

:*[[w:Illusory_correlation|Illusory Correlation]]: beliefs that inaccurately suppose a relationship between a certain type of action and an effect

:*[[w:Egocentric_bias|Egocentric Bias]]: occurs when people claim more responsibility for themselves for the results of a joint action than an outside observer would.

:*[[w:False_consensus_effect|False Consensus Bias]]: the tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which others agree with them.

:*[[w:Fundamental_attribution_bias|Fundamental Attribution Bias]]: the tendency for people to over-emphasize personality-based explanations for behaviors observed in others while under-emphasizing the role and power of situational influences on the same behavior

:*[[w:Just-world_phenomenon|Just World Phenomenon]]: the tendency for people to believe that the world is &quot;just&quot; and therefore people &quot;get what they deserve.&quot;
   
:*[[w:Self_serving_bias|Self Serving Bias]]: the tendency to claim more responsibility for successes than failures. It may also manifest itself as a tendency for people to evaluate ambiguous information in a way beneficial to their interests

:*[[w:Illusion_of_transparency|Illusion of Transparency]]: people overestimate others' ability to know them, and they also overestimate their ability to know others.

:*[[w:Ingroup_bias|Ingroup Bias]]: the tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others they perceive to be members of their own groups.

== Why is Conflict Resolution Important in a Team Setting? ==

Whether we embrace it or avoid it, conflict is an inherent part of the human condition.  Unlike certain tasks or responsibilities, conflict is not isolated to one or another aspect of life.  With conflict looming all about us, why should we even bother trying to resolve it?  Or, if conflict is inherent to being human, is it then presumptuous to even attempt its resolution?  We propose that, in the vast majority of instances of team conflict, avoidance is a worse solution than engagement with the conflicting situation.  Moreover, avoided conflict will lead to less optimal solutions and may even prevent the team from finishing a project.  Thus, from a manager’s perspective, it is a simple equation of a cost/benefits analysis in that the cost to the organization is greater when teams avoid conflict than when they engage it.  In this chapter we will discuss the symptoms of conflict and recommend solutions for their resolution.

Conflict absorbs team resources that could be better utilized working towards the team’s goals.  As discussed, managers should manage conflict in a way that leads the team towards completion of team goals.  

== What are the Symptoms of Team Conflict? ==

Almost everyone has endured the experience of being part of a team that was plagued with conflict.  Whether in a large group that erupts in anger and can’t finish a meeting, or a small group of two or three individuals that resort to backbiting and gossiping to vent frustration over a conflict, everyone has been a part of a team where conflict has gotten out of control.  With this in mind, there are several symptoms of conflict that can be identified in groups which can help groups to recognize and manage conflict before it tears them apart.  By identifying the following symptoms related to communication, trust, and opposing agendas, the team leader can identify conflict before it erupts.  As you read through these symptoms, think of the teams that you are a part of and look for symptoms that exist in your team. 

One common symptom of conflict is a lack of [[communication]] or a lack of respectful communication.  This is most often seen when teams fail to have meaningful meetings.  Most often, non-communicating meetings are characterized by team members sitting and listening to what the boss has to say.  Often chatter or silence prevails in teams.  A lack of communication can also be noted when team members don’t get along, and so refuse to talk to each other.  These feuds create barriers within teams and prevent communication in the team.  
A lack of communication or disrespectful communication leads to a lack of trust, which is another symptom of team conflict.  Teams that fail to produce desired results often lack the trust in one another as team members necessary to succeed.  Without trust in a team, verbal or non-verbal conflict becomes the norm of the team. Team members spend more energy protecting their own positions and jobs then they do producing what is required for the team’s success. When trust erodes in a team, the habit of blaming others becomes the norm as individuals try to protect themselves.  Team members become enemies that compete against each other rather than allies that build and help one another to achieve a common goal.  Teams that lack trust often gossip about other members or have frequent side conversations after meetings to discuss opposing opinions.  Such activity sucks strength out of the team and its purpose. 

Another symptom of team conflict can be seen when team members have opposing agendas.  This is not to be confused with members who have different opinions.  Having different opinions in a group can be very healthy if managed correctly because it can create better ideas and ways of getting the job done.  However, when team members have opposing agendas, more is at stake than differing opinions; it is two individuals fiercely committed to the exact opposite approach.  Opposing agendas can create confusion in team members and can cause them to lose sight of their role in the team and the team’s final goal.  Teams must work toward a common goal in order to be successful.  Extreme effort must be made to reconcile differences, or such a team can look forward to failure.

== What are Appropriate Solutions to Conflict? ==

As mentioned above, conflict is a natural and necessary element of a healthy team experience.  If a team never experiences conflict, it is less likely to be as productive as a team that does experience conflict.  This is especially true if the task that a team is attempting to complete is complex in nature or highly detailed.  Without having members question specific actions, decisions, or the specifics of the proposed solution, it may appear to the team that there is only one way in which to solve the problem or complete the task.   

One way in which a team can avoid being unproductive is by selecting members with different backgrounds.  This can be difficult because people often assume that individuals who think similarly and get along with one another will be more productive when working together.  But this is not necessarily true.  In many cases having groups of people who think alike and are not willing to voice their disagreement can be detrimental, or even dangerous.  Popular examples of this group think phenomenon are noted in the Kennedy Administration’s disaster with regards to the Bay of Pigs, or those involved with the Challenger shuttle launch. Differences among team members should however, be task orientated and not personal or relationship oriented.  Relationship conflicts are rarely productive.  If potential members of a team have a history of conflict due to relationships and not in relation to tasks, one or both should probably not be chosen as a team member.  Additionally, peacekeepers should also be avoided, unless the team environment fosters a very safe atmosphere where the peacekeeper will feel comfortable enough to speak out in the team setting.  In this case, a difference in opinion could be beneficial, but it might not be presented due to the member’s disproportionate desire to avoid conflict.  

Avoiding the potential for group think, relationship conflicts, and peacekeepers in choosing team members will help to promote healthy conflict.  But commitment is equally important.  If team members are individually or collectively indifferent toward the overall goal, they probably will not perform well.  A lack of commitment can also lead to a lack of conflict.  If the team is committed to the overall goal and members are well chosen, there can be a healthy dose of conflict in the process to complete the task.

When conflict does occur, it is important to address it immediately.  Although developing a solution to the conflict may take time, acknowledging it will help to ensure that it can become productive to the team. “Whatever the problem, effective teams identify, raise, and resolve it. If it’s keeping them from reaching their goal, effective teams try to do something about it. They don’t ignore it and hope it goes away.”  By not addressing conflict, the leader risks sending the message that conflict is unmanageable and cause vested members to become complacent or feel their input is not valued.  In the worst scenario, a conflict that is not resolved could go from being task orientated to personal.

== How Can a Team Prevent Negative Conflict? ==

Conflict may be inevitable on a team and may even have a positive effect, “the absence of conflict is not harmony, it’s apathy.”  However, most of us have had experience with the crippling side of conflict. In this section we offer insight into how other teams have successfully managed conflict and make recommendations for mechanisms to put into place in order to prevent harmful conflict. 
How do successful teams manage conflict?

Three business professors, who studied teams which had learned how to successfully “fight” in a team without allowing the conflict to become destructive, found some common themes as to how such teams function.  First, successful teams worked with more, rather than less information and debated on the basis of facts.  Second, teams developed multiple alternatives to enrich the level of debate.  Third, productive teams shared commonly agreed upon goals and objectives.  Fourth, teams injected humor into the decision-making process.  Fifth, teams maintained a balanced power structure.  And sixth, teams resolved issues without forcing consensus.

In another study, which surveyed 15,000 team members and their assessments of their team mates, two professors found that the most important behaviors in team relationships are openness and supportiveness, “Regardless of whether it was a working relationship with a peer, a superior, or a direct report, the result was the same. The two factors identified as most important were openness and supportiveness.”  Moreover, the authors identify specifically what is meant by these two adjectives within a team context: openness “refers to the ability to surface and deal with issues objectively,”  while supportiveness “refers to bringing out the best thinking and attitude in the other person.”

From the above insights into successful teams, we start to see that such teams put a high value on fact-based decisions and are able to set up mechanisms that bring out the best in each team member and facilitate information sharing.  Drawing from these insights, then, what specific measures, should a new leader or newly formed team put into place to ensure the team can withstand conflict and even gain the benefits of creativity that comes out of conflict?

== How Do Teams Prevent Damaging Conflict? ==

In order to prevent damaging conflict, the team leader must lay a conflict-friendly foundation for the team. The following approach will help the team leader to set the stage for conflict that is creative and productive:

# Set a clear goal for the team.
# Make expectations for team members explicit.
# Assemble a heterogeneous team, including diverse ages, genders, functional backgrounds, and industry experience. 
# Meet together as a team regularly and often. Team members that don’t know one another well doesn’t know positions on the issues, impairing their ability to argue effectively. Frequent interaction builds the mutual confidence and familiarity team members require expressing dissent. 
# Assign roles such as devil’s advocate and sky-gazing visionary and change these roles up from meeting to meeting. This is important to ensure all sides of an issue have been considered. 
# Use techniques such as role-playing, putting oneself in the competitor’s shoes, or conducting war games. Such techniques create fresh perspectives and engage team members. 
# Actively manage conflict. Don’t let the team acquiesce too soon or too easily. Identify and treat apathy early, and don’t confuse a lack of conflict with agreement. 

== Resolving Conflict ==

Interpersonal conflict should be managed and resolved before it degenerates into verbal assault and irreparable damage to a team. Dealing with interpersonal conflict can be a difficult and uncomfortable process.  Usually, as team members, we use carefully worded statements to avoid frictions when confronting conflict. 
 
The first step to resolving interpersonal conflict is in acknowledging the existence of the interpersonal conflict. Recognizing the conflict allows team members to build common ground by putting the conflict within the context of the larger goal of the team and the organization. Moreover, the larger goal can help by giving team members a motive for resolving the conflict. 

The Rosetta Stone for dealing with conflict is communication.  As team members we all understand the inevitability of interpersonal conflicts. Moreover, as we have established above, open and supportive communication is vital to a high performing team.  One way to achieve this is by separating the problem from the person. Problems can be debated without damaging working relationships. When interpersonal conflict occurs, all sides of the issue should be recognized without finger-pointing or blaming. Above all, when team member gets yelled at or blamed for something, it has the effect of silencing the whole team. It gives the signal to everyone that dissent is not allowed, and, as we know, dissent is one of the most fertile resources for new ideas. 

When faced with conflict, it is natural for team members to become defensive.  However defensiveness usually makes it more difficult to resolve a conflict.  A conflict-friendly team environment must encourage effective listening. Effective listening includes listening to one another attentively, without interruption (this includes not having side conversations, doodling, or vacant stares).
The fundamentals to resolving team conflict include the following elements: 

# Prior to stating one’s view, a speaker should seek to understand what others have said. This can be done in a few clarifying sentences, 
# Seek to make explicit what the opposing sides have in common. This helps to reinforce what is shared between the disputants, 
# Whether or not an agreement is reached, team members should thank the other for having expressed his view and feelings. Thanking the other recognizes the personal risk the individual took in breaking from group think and should be viewed as an expression of trust and commitment toward the team. 

=== How Can Teams Resolve Conflict Between Factions? ===

In resolving conflict between factions, the team leader should start by bringing the groups together and acknowledging there is a conflict. The team leader should make sure all group members are clear about the group goal.  Not only should each group member understand what the goal is, they each need to be willing to work toward achieving it. 
 
Set ground rules for the group if this has not been done.  An important rule to include is to eliminate outside politicking.  When disagreements or issues arise, they should be discussed within the group.  Factions should not have separate discussions about the problem.  If ground rules have already been established, discuss whether all agree with them and are willing to follow them.  Discuss the methods and processes that will be used to reach the team goal.  Again, it is important to get all team members working together towards the common goal.

The team leader should stay alert to one faction forcing a particular solution.  If such an instance arises, those forcing a solution should be asked to articulate the reason behind their thinking.  Once the thinking has been articulated, there can be open discussion as to the merits and drawbacks to the proposed solution. 

=== What Should a Team Leader Do To Resolve Conflict and Promote Team Performance? ===
Team leaders have the responsibility of resolving conflict within their teams.  There are things that team leaders can do to make a team where conflict resolution occurs naturally.  One thing that team leaders can do in their groups to resolve conflict is to set up team rules from the outset.  As discussed earlier, such team rules can guide team members to resolve conflict between themselves, rather than going to the leader to resolve all conflict.  Team leaders should foster an environment in their teams that is safe and positive.  Such an environment will help foster communication and will help team members to resolve conflicts.  Team leaders can also provide retreats and other activities away from the office that will help to build team unity and trust.  These factors will also strengthen a team and help to avoid negative conflict before it begins. 

Team leaders can also strictly monitor performance issues in their group.  Performance issues that go unresolved create relationship conflict and a lack of motivation and morale.  Performance issues in individual team members must be addressed immediately in order to avoid issues in the group.  This doesn’t mean that team leaders always need to eliminate poor performing team members immediately.  Sometimes it is the responsibility of the team leader to provide extra training to team members when they’re struggling, to help them meet expectations.  When attitudes need to be changed, awareness can be brought to how a team member’s attitude negatively affects the team and invitations can be given for attitudes to improve.  

In this process it is vital for the team leader to remember that accountability must be held with team members.  Without accountability in a team, focus on the goal will not occur and teams won’t produce desired outcomes.  Accountability promotes achievement and helps team members to reach their potential.  A lack of accountability can produce great task conflict and relationship conflict.  Full accountability can help produce a feeling of fulfillment and achievement and teams will achieve their optimal performance.

=== How Can a Team Member Resolve a Conflict with the Team Leader? ===

If a team member has a conflict with the team leader, the first step is to identify the type of conflict.  If the conflict relates to the goal of the team, then it would appear that the goal is not clear.  The conflict can also relate to the processes being used by the team.  In either situation, the team member can bring up the issue in a group meeting.  Ask that the goal be clarified so that all team members understand what it is.  If processes were never discussed and decided on by the team, now would be an appropriate time to do so.  If the team leader does not want to discuss these issues in a team meeting, the team member should approach the leader separately to discuss.  The team member should explain the issue and why the current situation is not working.  Again, ask that the team be allowed to discuss these issues.

If the conflict is interpersonal between the team leader and a team member, the issue should be discussed privately between the two.  The team member should go to the leader and explain that there appears to be conflict and that he or she would like to resolve it.  LaFasto and Larson outline an approach that can be used to resolve conflict called the Connect Model.  The steps involved in the model are as follows: 

# Commit to the relationship. 
# Optimize safety. 
# Narrow to one issue. 
# Neutralize defensiveness.
# Explain and echo.
# Change one behavior each.
# Track it!

These steps provide a great review of what has been discussed throughout this chapter and will help to resolve the issue between a team leader and team member.    

In summary, team conflict is an important and integral part of any team that exists. As we have outlined it in this chapter, conflict, if approached effectively and managed appropriately, can exponentially work in the favor of any team. Appropriate management of the relative type of team conflict at hand is critical for teams to be successful.  This chapter has discussed several of the aspects of team conflict and how they can be best managed and potentially resolved. These concepts will help teams improve their functionality and dynamic effectiveness in an effort to reach their ultimate goals in reaching to be a high performing team.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rape is a crime where the victim is forced into sexual activity, in particular sexual penetration, against his or her will. The word originates from the Latin rapere: to seize or take by force. The Latin term for the act of rape itself is raptus.

Originally, the word rape was akin to rapine, rapture, raptor, and rapacious, and referred to the more general violations, such as looting, destruction, and capture of citizens that are inflicted upon a town or country during war, e.g. the Rape of Nanking. Today, some dictionaries still define rape to include any serious and destructive assault against a person or community. This article, however, focuses primarily on sexual assault. Rape is an issue of central concern to many feminists.

==Violent rape==
&quot;Violent rape&quot; is when violence beyond the rape itself is a part of the assault. This may include physical force or threat of harm, including death threat or threat against a family member. People who commit violent rapes include both strangers and people whom the victim already knows. Proportionally more violent rapes are likely to be reported. &lt;ref&gt; Bachman, R., &amp; Saltzman, L. (1995). Violence against women: Estimates from the redesigned survey (No.
NCJ-154348). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Statutory rape==
National and/or regional governments, citing an interest in protecting minors, consider people under a certain age to be unable to give informed consent, and accordingly treat any sexual contact with minors as &quot;rape&quot;, even if he or she agrees to the sexual activity. The age at which individuals are considered competent to give consent is called the age of consent. The age set by each state vary in accordance with local standards, and range from 12 to 21. Sex which violates age-of-consent law, but is neither violent nor physically coerced, is sometimes described as &quot;statutory rape&quot;, the name of a legally-recognized category in the United States.

== Acquaintance (&quot;date&quot;) rape ==
The term, &quot;acquaintance rape&quot; (or &quot;date rape&quot;) refers to rape or non-consensual sexual activity between people who are already acquainted, or who know each other socially — friends, acquaintances, people on a date, or even people in an existing romantic relationship — where it is alleged that consent for sexual activity was not given, or was given under duress. In most jurisdictions, there is no legal distinction between rape committed by a stranger, or by an acquaintance, friend or lover.

There is often more difficulty in securing conviction against an assailant who is known by the victim at the time. This is due to the &quot;grey&quot; nature of the situation. In what is colloquially described as a &quot;grey rape&quot; case, the victim is unable to demonstrate non-consent although he or she expresses displeasure at the encounter. The expression, &quot;grey rape&quot;, refers to the absence of information — there is nothing &quot;grey&quot; in the act itself: if the act was non-consensual at the time it occurred, then it is considered rape, even if not actionably so. Contributing factors to &quot;grey&quot; rape include poor communication by either party, misleading or (deliberately) misreading body language, or the feeling by one party of being unsure or unable to express what one wishes (which may be due to many reasons). The standard of proof required for non-consensual sexual activity is often harder to meet (or easier to deny) than when two strangers meet, or where there has been violence.

In general, some evidence suggests that rapists are far more likely to know their victims than not. Other reports suggest that it can work both ways. Not only is acquaintance rape more common than previously thought, but situations of this kind can more often give rise to false allegations than had been expected (see False reporting).

== Male rape == 
Men can also be raped. According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics, for 2003 [2], 9.9% of rape and sexual assault victims in the United States, age 12 and older, are male; therefore, nearly 17 out of every 100,000 males are victims. According to the data for 2004, this number has fallen to 2.95%; therefore, slightly more than 5 out of every 100,000 males are victims. Many of these male victims are likely children and there may be many more male victims under age 12 (not included in BJS figures).

==Gang rape==
Gang-rape (also known as &quot;pack rape&quot;) occurs when a group of people participates in the rape of a single victim. It is far more damaging for the victim, and in some jurisdictions, is punished more severely than a rape by one person. &quot;Gang bang&quot; is also a slang term for consensual group sex. (It is not to be confused with the slang word &quot;gangbanger&quot; referring to a member of a criminal gang; the &quot;bang&quot; in that word refers to the sound of gunfire.)

According to Roy Hazelwood, a profiler of sexual crimes, gang rape &quot;involves three or more offenders and you always have a leader and a reluctant participant. Those are extremely violent, and what you find is that they're playing for each other's approval. It gets into a pack mentality and can be horrendous.&quot;

      <comment>/* Sentence Structure */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several different types of sentences.  Each are classified based on their structure and their purpose.

==Sentence Structure==
Using a variety of sentences helps the reader follow the flow of a writer’s thoughts. Choosing between simple, compound, and complex sentences and mixing them up throughout the material will keep the reader interested. Varying the length of the sentences also keeps the reader involved.

Reading material that marches along becomes tedious. For example:

''The band marched along the street, and the director signaled for the drums to play. A red car stopped at the intersection, and the parents walked beside the band. The parents squirted water into the musicians’ mouths, and the trumpet players started to play. The band marched past the intersection, and the red car proceeded down the street''.  

Reading this group of compound sentences becomes boring. If the writer mixes up the types of sentences like the example below, the sentences will flow more easily for the reader. 

''As the band marched along the street, the director signaled for the drums to play. A red car stopped at the intersection. While the parents walked beside the band, they squirted water into the trumpet players’ mouths. The trumpet players started to play. The band marched past the intersection, and the red car proceeded down the street.''  

The first sentence is complex, and the second one is simple. The third is again complex while the fourth is simple. The fifth sentence is compound. The choppiness is gone, and a flow is created.

Sentence structure is determined based on the number of clauses in the sentence.  A clause can be independent or subordinate.

===Independent clause===

* Full sentence pattern that can operate on its own and does not function within another sentence pattern.
* Contains a subject plus a verb and any objects, any modifiers.
*It either stands alone or could stand alone.
--Example: May studied in the library for her final exam.

===Subordinate clause===

*Pattern like a full sentence (has subjects and verbs) but functions within a sentence.
*Can function as a noun, adjective or adverb.
*Can not stand alone as a complete sentence.
*Sometimes called a dependent clause.
--Example: After May studied in the library for her final exam, she went home.

===Complement Clause===
*Ordinary --- If you examine the structure of the entire sentence, you will see that this complement clause is taking the place of a direct object.  This is common for ordinary complement clauses.  Certain verbs, which your text goes into in detail, allow this. 
-- Example:     I know [that James went to Yale]. 
*Noun --- In a noun complement clause construction, the complement clause occurs after a noun.  The number of nouns that can be used in this construction is limited.  Some examples are 'the fact', 'the rumor', 'the suggestion', 'the idea', etc. 
-- Example:  I love the idea [that chimps can talk]. 
*Adjective --- In an adjective complement clause construction the clause occurs after an adjective. 
-- Example:  I am pleased [that George went to the party].

===The Relative Clause===
A relative clause--also called an adjective or adjectival clause--will meet three requirements. First, it will contain a subject and verb. Next, it will begin with a relative pronoun [who, whom, whose, that, or which] or a relative adverb [when, where, or why]. Finally, it will function as an adjective, answering the questions What kind? How many? or Which one? The relative clause will follow one of these two patterns:

 Relative Pronoun [or Relative Adverb]  +  Subject  +  Verb  =   Incomplete Thought  

 Relative Pronoun [Functioning as Subject]  +  Verb  =  Incomplete Thought

===Examples=== 

; Simple sentence
: One independent clause with no subordinate clauses.  It does not contain more than one full sentence pattern.
:: ''Without love, life would be empty.''
: This sentence contains a subject (life), a verb (would be) and 2 types of modifiers (Without love and empty).

; Compound sentence
: Composed of two or more independent clauses with no subordinate clauses.  The two clauses are usually joined by a comma and a conjunction or a semicolon.
:: ''Together we stand, but united we fall.''
: This sentence contains 2 clauses which are joined by &quot;but&quot;.

; Complex sentence
: Composed of one independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses.
:: ''They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.''
: &quot;that sow in tears&quot; is the subordinate clause.

; Compound-complex sentence
: Contains at least two independent clauses and at least one subordinate clause.
:: ''Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.''
: This sentence contains two independent clauses (one before and one after the comma) and each independent clause contains a subordinate clause (&quot;what you eat&quot; and &quot;what you are&quot;).

==Sentence Purpose==

* '''Declarative sentence''' - used to make a statement
*: ''My dog barks at everything.''

* '''Imperative sentence''' - used to make a request or demand
*: ''Give me that.''

* '''Interrogative sentence''' - used to ask a question
*: ''What are you doing?''

* '''Exclamatory sentence''' - used to make an exclamation
*: ''I don't want that!''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History of Feminist Philosophy==

The very beginnings of Western philosophy have included discussions about the status of women. Plato spoke of women's roles in ''The Republic''. He claimed that while there are some obvious physical differences between men and women, there are some women that are taller, stronger, etc. than most men. Furthermore, Plato claimed that there are no differences between men and women's ability to understand reality and make reasonable judgements about it. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2h.htm|last=Kemerling|first=Garth|date=2006-08-01|title=Plato: The Republic 5-10|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Plato's student, Aristotle held a very low opinion of women. Aristotle in his work, ''Politics'' claims that women ought to be treated as property. Furthermore, the best a woman can achieve is to rear a fine family. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/study/xari.htm|last=Roberts|first=Andrew |date=2006-08-01|title=Aristotle on reason, the state, slavery and women |accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics of Interest to Feminist Philosophers==

Feminism within philosophy is a very large field; the topic encompasses most, if not all, disciplines that philosophy covers. Feminists have an interest in subjects ranging from Aesthetics to the Philosophy of Religion, thus it would be dishonest to say that Feminist philosophers study one particular subject or intersection. We can, however, safely say that Feminist philosophers are interested in how gender, race and class (among other things) affect and are affected by philosophy. 

Below is a general list of topics that have prominent Feminist interest.

===Analytic Philosophy===

===Contenental Philosophy===

===Philosophy of Science===

===Aesthetics===

===Ethics===

==Famous Feminist Philosophers==

===John Stuart Mill===

===Simon de Bouviour===

**316 pts. Phase III. Stage I NHL of Waldeyer's ring. Randomized to extended-field RT alone, chemotherapy alone (CHOP or CHOP-like), or combined therapy with chemo + RT. 
**Median f/u 6.8 yrs. CR in 93%, 87%, 97%. 5-yr FFS 48%, 45%, 83% (SS); OS 56%, 58%, 90% (SS).
**Conclusion: improved results with combined chemo+RT.

'''''Treatments:'''''

*'''Dunleavy, 2012''' (NCI) PMID 23574119 -- &quot;Dose-adjusted EPOCH-rituximab therapy in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.&quot; (N Engl J Med. 2013 Apr 11;368(15):1408-16)
**Phase 2 prospective prospective study of infusional dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide with vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) and filgrastim without radiotherapy in 51 patients with untreated primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.  
**Outcome: The patients had a median age of 30 years (range, 19 to 52) and a median tumor diameter of 11 cm; 59% were women. During a median of 5 years of follow-up, the event-free survival rate was 93%, and the overall survival rate was 97%. Among the 16 patients who were involved in the retrospective analysis at another center, over a median of 3 years of follow-up, the event-free survival rate was 100%, and no patients received radiotherapy. No late morbidity or cardiac toxic effects were found in any patients. After follow-up ranging from 10 months to 14 years, all but 2 of the 51 patients (4%) who received DA-EPOCH-R alone were in complete remission. The 2 remaining patients received radiotherapy and were disease-free at follow-up.
**Conclusion: Therapy with DA-EPOCH-R obviated the need for radiotherapy in patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.

*'''Padova, 2007''' (Italy) PMID 17379431 -- &quot;Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma: results of intensive chemotherapy regimens (MACOP-B/VACOP-B) plus involved field radiotherapy on 53 patients. A single institution experience.&quot; (Mazzarotto R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Jul 1;68(3):823-9.)
**Retrospective. 53 consecutive patients with PMLBCL (90% Stage I-II) treated with induction [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#Pro-MACE-MOPP|ProMACE-MOPP]] (n=2), [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#MACOP-B|MACOP-B]] (n=11), and [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#VACOP-B|VACOP-B]] (n=40), followed by IFRT. RT started 3-4 after chemo, modified mantle and SCV if involved at diganosis. Dose 30.6/17 - 39.6/22 (mean 36/20). Treatment completed in 80%. Median F/U 7.8 years
**Outcome: 5-year OS 93%, DFS 87%. Response after chemo: CR 38%, PR 57%. If PR, 92% obtained CR after IFRT
**Conclusion: Intensive chemo + IFRT efficacious; IFRT plays a pivotal role in inducing CR

*'''Verona, 2004''' (Italy)(1982-1999) PMID 14735179 -- &quot;Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL): long-term results from a retrospective multicentre Italian experience in 138 patients treated with CHOP or MACOP-B/VACOP-B.&quot; (Todeschini G, Br J Cancer. 2004 Jan 26;90(2):372-6.)
**Retrospective. 13 Italian centers. 138 patients with PMLBCL treated with [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#CHOP|CHOP]] (n=43) or [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|MACOP-B/VACOP-B]] (n=95). 76% patients in CR received IFRT
**Outcome: CR CHOP 51% vs. MACOP-B/VACOP-B 80% (SS); EFS 40% vs. 76% (SS). IFRT improved outcome, irrespective of chemo
**Conclusion: MACOP-B/VACOP-B better than CHOP; consolidation IFRT improves outcome in CR patients

***Median f/u 65 mo. All pts received R-CHOP, 50 received CNS prophylaxis, 47 received testicular RT. 5-yr PFS 74% and OS 85%. 10 pts with relapses: 2 in LNs, 5 in extranodal organs, 3 in CNS. 5-yr CNS relapse rate 6%. No contralateral testis relapses. 10 pts died (6 from lymphoma). 
***Conclusion: Good outcome for PTL with chemotherapy with CNS prophylaxis and RT to the contralateral testis. CNS prophylaxis deserves further investigation.

==Primary Bone Lymphoma==
*'''Rare Cancer Network; 2012''' (1987-2008) PMID  22079728 -- &quot;Early-Stage Primary Bone Lymphoma: A Retrospective, Multicenter Rare Cancer Network (RCN) Study.&quot; (Cai L, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 May 1;83(1):284-91.) -- Median f/u 41 m.
**Multi-institutional. 116 pts, Stages I-II (I-80%, II-20%). Pathology was re-classified using the WHO classification (DLBCL in 78%).
**75% received chemoradiotherapy. 88% received chemo (+/- RT). Chemo was CHOP in 68%, R-CHOP in 32%. 
**CR in 74%. LF in 10%. LC: 5-yr 92%, 10-yr 80%. OS: 5-yr 76%, 10-yr 72%. LSS (lymphoma-specific survival): 78% at 5 and 10 yrs.
**Distant progression in 15% at a median of 7 months. 
**By RT dose: LF 12% (for &lt;40 Gy) vs 8% (&gt;40 Gy); NS. LF was in-field in 50%.
**Independent prognostic features: IPI score, RT dose, CR, and chemo.
**Conclusion: Good prognosis. Chemotherapy followed by RT is superior to rt-&gt;chemo. RT plays a role in local control. Better outcome for more than 6 chemotherapy cycles and more than 40 Gy RT.

*'''Italy; 2004''' (1983-2001) PMID 15183479 -- &quot;Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the bone: treatment and analysis of prognostic factors for Stage I and Stage II.&quot; (Barbieri E, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jul 1;59(3):760-4.) -- Median f/u 149 m (12 yr)
**77 pts with Stage I (44) or Stage II (33) primary bone lymphoma. All pts had RT to median 40 Gy; 67 pts had chemo.
**CR in 94.8%. Relapse in 18.2% at median of 23 months. 15-yr DFS 76.6%, OS 88.3%. 
**Prognostic factors: Age &lt;40 was the only significant factor for worse DFS. 
**Conclusion: &quot;In PLB the CMT seems to produce a better outcome than RT alone; that still remains the best treatment for local disease control. Radiation therapy alone should be reserved for mandibular tumors, which are usually very small and earlier diagnosed.&quot;

      <comment>add some references to &quot;user levels&quot;, which seems somehow related to &quot;user ability&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">It is important for designers of mass-market User Interfaces to keep in mind that not all users are equally computer savvy. A mass-market operating system, such as Windows, has amongst its user base both beginners, as well as experienced power-users. What makes an OS interface more user-friendly for a first-time user may not be user-friendly to a power-user. For instance, the 'Clippy' assistant in Office may be of assistance to first-time users. Yet it is often described as annoying for seasoned users of office suite software, and in many cases may detract from the usability of the software.

As a rule, operating systems meant for more advanced users have fewer graphical configuration tools, and may have more of a focus on speed than looks.  As an example, Slackware Linux has virtually no configuration tools and so is seen as a power-user's operating system, while Ubuntu has most tasks automated and so is seen as a user-friendly operating system.

Nearly all operating systems, even if they have a easy-to-use GUI, also allow users to go around the GUI to hand-tweak the configuration.
&quot;It is a significant advantage to all users if advanced users can make hand-tweaked modifications to config files when serious problems arise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wiki: PreferenceEditorPattern]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people have the idea of making the computer present one user interface by default to new users, then later present a different &quot;advanced user interface&quot; to &quot;advanced users&quot;.
This is generally regarded as a well-meaning mistake.&lt;ref&gt;

==Nasal NK/T lymphoma==
===History===
Before 2000, NK/T lymphomas were not a clearly-defined entity and were lumped together with other lymphomas of the nasal cavity.
===Clinical features===
NK cell has worse prognosis than B or T cell lymphoma.
&lt;br&gt;Nasal lymphomas in Western populations have a better prognosis than in Asian countries. This may be due to a higher proportion of NK lymphomas or EBV-associated tumors in Asia.

*Hong Kong, 1998 - PMID 9440725 &amp;mdash; &quot;Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the nose and nasopharynx: clinical features, tumor immunophenotype, and treatment outcome in 113 patients.&quot; Cheung MM et al. J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jan;16(1):70-7. 
**113 pts.

===Treatment===
====Overview====
RT is recommended as the primary treatment. Consolidative CT should be considered for pts with adverse risk factors or Stage IIE disease.

====Modality====
*'''Japan, JCOG0211''' - phase I/II
**33 pts total; 23 pts on phase II. Stage IE-IIE. Concurrent chemo/RT with 50 Gy and DeVIC (dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, carboplatin) x 3 courses.
**'''2009''' PMID 19805668 -- &quot;Phase I/II study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for localized nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma: Japan Clinical Oncology Group Study JCOG0211.&quot; (Yamaguchi M, J Clin Oncol. 2009 Nov 20;27(33):5594-600.)
***27 pts treated to recommended dose from phase I. Median f/u 32 months. 2-yr OS 78%. (Historical control of RT alone: 45%) 77% with CR, 1 pt with PR.
**Conclusion: chemo/RT is safe and effective

*'''Korea''' - phase II
**30 pts. Stage IE-IIE. Concurrent chemo/RT with median 40 Gy and weekly cisplatin. Followed by 3 cycles of VIPD (etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin, dexamethasone).
**'''2009''' PMID 19884539 -- &quot;Phase II trial of concurrent radiation and weekly cisplatin followed by VIPD chemotherapy in newly diagnosed, stage IE to IIE, nasal, extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma: Consortium for Improving Survival of Lymphoma study.&quot; (Kim SJ, J Clin Oncol. 2009 Dec 10;27(35):6027-32.)
***Response rate to cisplatin+RT: 100% (73% CR, 27% PR). Overall CR rate (after VIPD): 80%. 
***3-yr PFS 85%, OS 86%. 
**Conclusion: recommend concurrent chemo/RT

'''''Retrospective data:'''''
*Hong Kong, 1995 (1975-93) - PMID 7884427 &amp;mdash; &quot;Treatment outcome and prognostic factors for primary nasal lymphoma.&quot; Liang R et al. J Clin Oncol. 1995 Mar;13(3):666-70. 
**Retrospective. 100 pts. Various types (many were T-cell). RT alone or chemo-&gt;RT.

*MDACC, 1997 (1947-93) - PMID 9241082 &amp;mdash; &quot;Lymphoma of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses: improved outcome and altered prognostic factors with combined modality therapy.&quot; Logsdon MD et al. Cancer. 1997 Aug 1;80(3):477-88. 
**''Note:'' per the Working Formulation, most were diffuse large cell type. Immunophenotype was not available for most patients.
**Retrospective. 70 pts. Western population. 
**Improved FFP in those treated with CMT vs RT alone. 

*Hong Kong, 2002 (1977-2001) - PMID 12182990 &amp;mdash; &quot;Early stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma: clinical outcome, prognostic factors, and the effect of treatment modality.&quot; Cheung MM et al.  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Sep 1;54(1):182-90.
**All pts are NK/T (CD56+). 79 pts (61 chemo+RT, 18 RT alone). CR in 68.4%. Of those, 44% relapsed. 5-yr DFS 35.5%, OS 37.9%. No difference between those treated with RT alone vs combined modality.

*South Korea, 2004 (1976-98) - PMID 15234048 &amp;mdash; &quot;Angiocentric T-cell and NK/T-cell lymphomas: radiotherapeutic viewpoints.&quot; Koom WS et al.  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jul 15;59(4):1127-37.
**102 pts. RT alone to median dose of 45 Gy. 72% CR, but most of those experienced relapse, and 47% of all pts had local failure.
**Conclusion: high local failure rate with RT alone. Plateau in dose response curve around 54 Gy.

*China, 2005 (1983-2003) - PMID 16382127 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiotherapy as primary treatment for stage IE and IIE nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.&quot; Li YX et al. J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jan 1;24(1):181-9. 
**Retrospective. 105 pts. Stage IE and IIE. Pts received RT alone or combined modality. Initial RT resulted in CR of 83% vs CR of 20% for initial chemotherapy. OS and PFS were similar for RT alone and CMT.
**Conclusion: recommend RT as primary therapy. Addition of CT does not lead to improved survival.

====RT dose====
Doses &gt;50 Gy are recommended.

*'''Japan''', Sakata - PMID 9208902 - recommend &gt;50 Gy
*'''Japan''', Shikama - PMID 9240537 - recommend &gt;50 Gy

type=Dark Creature|
features=Invisible to Muggles|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]|}}

== Overview ==

'''''Dementors''''' are the guards of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban Prison]]; it is difficult to tell what their features are, because they conceal themselves completely under flowing black cloaks.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

It was a &quot;cloaked figure&quot;. &quot;Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood.&quot; When we first see it, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], we do see a part of it: there was &quot;a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, greyish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed in water; the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings.&quot;

Dementors are dark creatures that consume human happiness, creating an ambiance of coldness, darkness, misery and despair. Because of their power to drain happiness and hope from humans, they have been set the duty of being guards at Azkaban, where they prevent the prisoners from having the ability or desire to escape.

This creature has the property that only wizards can see it. Muggles can still feel them, though. Its only known ability, besides the happiness drain, is the ability to perform the &quot;Dementor's Kiss&quot;, which is the act of extracting the human soul through the mouth, leaving nothing more than a living body. This process is irreversible.

They &quot;are among the foulest creature that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will sucked out of you. If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life.&quot;

The only spell we are aware of which is able to repel these creatures, is called the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus charm]]. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] asserts that the Patronus charm is the only way to battle Dementors, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] tells him that he is wrong; but this supposed different way of tackling Dementors is never described.

== Analysis ==

From his first exposure to them, Harry is much more sensitive to their effects than anyone else – Harry alone, of the six people present in the train compartment, passes out when the Dementor enters to search it. Harry is very much afraid that this is a display of weakness, until just before Christmas, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] explains that Harry is more deeply affected because Dementors work by extracting good memories, leaving nothing but the bad recollections, and he has a much grimmer history than anyone else.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], we find that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] is opposed to allowing them into the school, but cannot prevent the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] from positioning them outside the grounds, at all the known entry points to the school. Their stated purpose at that time is to prevent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] from entering the castle, but one must wonder how the Ministry believed that would work, as Sirius had already escaped from Azkaban, so he must have some way of evading the Dementors. Possibly this is just the Ministry doing anything so that it appears to be doing something, as it so often does.

One also wonders why the Dementors would stay on as Azkaban guards, when there are so many people elsewhere in the world for them to suck emotion out of. Perhaps it was a mistake allowing so many of them to visit Hogwarts and discover exactly how thin the takings were in the prisoners at Azkaban, relative to the rest of the world. It is certainly true that they abandoned Azkaban with great alacrity in the middle of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']].

While it is never stated, there is an implication that the Dementors are a created being, rather than one that occurs naturally. The statement in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], that the Dementors are breeding, leads us to believe that they are of natural origin. Perhaps, like guard dogs, they were created from a naturally-occurring magical creature, possibly the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Lethifold|Lethifold]], by selective breeding methods, or by means of magical enhancement of the traits in which Wizards were interested.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], the Minister for Magic attributes the gloominess of the weather to escaped Dementors breeding and multiplying. Why are Harry and Ron unable to recognize this?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Although the Dementors leave Azkaban in the middle of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' to join [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], one has to wonder, given their earlier actions, whose side they are on from the beginning.

All through ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', though the Dementors are nominally seeking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], they seem to have fixated on Harry, to the point of trying to administer the Kiss to him rather than Sirius when both of them are trapped.

At the end of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', the Dementor that Cornelius Fudge has brought along with him, &quot;for his protection,&quot; administers the Kiss to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] before Fudge can interrogate him. If the Dementors had already allied with Voldemort, this would be sensible as it would increase the delay before Voldemort's return would be made public. Of course, the Dementor could have recognized Crouch as an escaped Azkaban inmate; however, that is unlikely, as Crouch had been replaced in Azkaban by his mother some ten years previous to our story, and the substitution had not then been noticed.

The two Dementors who attack Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] near [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] are apparently under orders from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], or at least so she claims [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 32|near the end of that book]]. There is some question at the time of the attack as to whether Umbridge was actually being controlled by Voldemort, as Harry's scar did later twinge at one point when she held his hand. Sirius, in conversation with Harry, dismisses that idea, though, saying that as bad as Umbridge is, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order]] does not believe her to be controlled by Voldemort.

From the long sequence of things done by the Dementors that directly hinders the Wizarding world, one must conclude that they are more inclined to follow Voldemort than the good Wizards, and additionally that at the best of times, Wizarding control over the Dementors is very tenuous indeed.

It is a shame, perhaps, that Snape never elucidates his comment about there being a better spell to eliminate Dementors. If they are breeding, as Fudge says at the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', then they will likely need to have their numbers cut down. As it is, we don't know if there is any method of effectively doing that; the Patronus charm will repel them, but we don't know of anything that will destroy them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As more sophisticated tools have been developed, our understanding of the universe has improved. Some proposed models of the universe were proven wrong, and other ideas are still with us today.

==Measuring distances in the universe==

The distances at the scale of the universe are gigantic, and our everyday metres and even kilometres are too small to be used. We need to use units that are more appropriate for large distances. Often, other units are convenient to use because of the way they are measured.

===The light-year===

One light-year is defined as the distance light travels in one year. As you know, light travels at &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^{8}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;ms^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and so the distance it covers in one year is enormous. One light year is approximately &lt;math&gt;10^{16}&lt;/math&gt; ''m''.

===The astronomical unit===

The astronomical unit is defined as the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. It originates from the fact that it was possible to measure the distances of the planets, but only in multiples of the distance between the Earth and Sun. It is still useful today for distances within the solar system. It is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;1.5 \times 10^{11}&lt;/math&gt; ''m''.
[[Image:Parallax Example.png|308px|thumb|A simplified example of parallax.]]
===The parsec===

One parsec is simply the reciprocal of half the angle of parallax of a star, when observed from Earth at two opposite points of its orbit. Parallax is the apparent change in position of an object against a fixed background when the position of the observer changes, like how buildings seem to move faster than background hills when you're in a car. It is convenient to find from the measured angle, and is therefore used mainly for the distances of stars. This concept is covered in more detail in [[A-level Physics/Cosmology/Stars and Galaxies|Stars &amp; Galaxies]]. One parsec is approximately &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^{16}&lt;/math&gt; ''m'', or 3.26 light-years.

==Overview of the solar system==
[[Image:Solar sys.jpg|thumb|250px|The Solar System, showing the Sun, the planets, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and a comet.]]
Our solar system consists of the Sun, the planets and an asteroid belt. Additionally, there are comets that have highly elliptical orbits, and return to the solar system at regular intervals.

===Planets===

There are eight planets orbiting the Sun (Pluto being reclassified as a dwarf planet), which is at the centre of the solar system. Most planets also have natural satellites, or moons, orbiting them. The table below outlines the main features of the planets, relative to the Earth:

===Asteroid belt===

There is a concentration of small, rocky asteroids between Mars and Jupiter, which is known as the asteroid belt. There are hundreds of thousands of these planetoids orbiting the Sun, and are sometimes called minor planets.

===Comets===

Comets are lumps of rock, frozen water, methane and ammonia that orbit the Sun, and are typically only a few kilometres in diameter. They have very eccentric (elliptical) orbits and therefore vary greatly in their distance from the Sun. When they are near the Sun, they have long tails of approximately 1AU, due to the Sun's radiation.

==The progress in the understanding of the universe==

The accepted model of the Solar System has been subject to great controversy over the decades. In the old '''geocentric''' model, the Earth was originally placed in the centre of the Solar System, and had the other planets and the Sun orbiting it. Now, the accepted model places the Sun in the centre, with the Earth and other planets orbiting around it.

===Copernicus===
[[Image:Retrograde-motion-of-mars.png|right|thumb|300px|The retrograde motion of Mars]]
[[w:Nicolaus Copernicus|Nicolaus Copernicus]] found the old '''geocentric''' model unnecessarily complicated. Instead of having the Earth in the centre of the universe, he decided to place the Sun in the centre, which we now call the '''heliocentric''' model. This model could very easily explain the movement of the planets and the Sun across the sky, and in particular the '''retrograde motion''' of Mars, where it would appear to move &quot;backwards&quot; across the sky for several weeks. This retrograde motion of Mars was previously explained by '''epicycles''' where it would &quot;loop-the-loop&quot; around at certain points. With Copernicus' new model, it was explained that since the Earth was closer to the Sun than Mars, there will be sections where the Earth will &quot;overtake&quot; Mars, and will make Mars apparently move backwards across the sky.

====Opposition to Copernicus====

Copernicus' heliocentric model was rejected by most people mainly because of religious beliefs at the time, and although it seemed to simplify the motion of the planets, it was less accurate than the geocentric model at fitting the observed movements of the planets.

People also argued that if the Earth was moving, the stars would have a detectable parallax. Copernicus claimed that the stars were too far away to detect any parallax, and with more sensitive equipment, he has now been proved correct. Another argument against the heliocentric model was that objects all fall towards the Earth, and so it must be the centre of the universe. This was the intuitive conclusion before Newton revolutionised our ideas about motion.

===Kepler===
[[Image:Kepler-first-law.png|right|thumb|150px|An elliptical orbit with the Sun at one of the foci]]
Johannes Kepler improved upon Copernicus' original model by using elliptical orbits instead of circular ones. He devised three laws of planetary motion:

====Kepler's first law====

Kepler found that the planets fit the observed pattern better with the heliocentric model if they travelled in ellipses, not circles, and had the Sun at one of the foci of these ellipses. Therefore Kepler's first law states:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The planets orbit the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Kepler's second law====
[[Image:Kepler-second-law.svg|left|thumb|150px|Equal areas are covered in equal amounts of time]]
Now that the planets had elliptical orbits, it would not make sense for them to travel at the same speed at all points of their orbit. The planets would speed up nearer the Sun, and move slower when they were further away from the Sun. Kepler observed that the imaginary triangle formed between the planet at two points in its orbit and the Sun always had the same area provided the two points of the planets orbit had the same time difference between them. From this it follows that a planets orbit is faster nearer the Sun than further away from it. Kepler's second law states that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The line connecting a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
[[Image:Semimajoraxis.png|right|thumb|The semi-major axis of an ellipse]]

====Kepler's third law====

Kepler realised that the distance of a planet from the Sun and its orbital period were related by the formula: &lt;math&gt;T^2 \propto d^3&lt;/math&gt;, where T is the time taken for one orbit, and d is the distance from the Sun, although it is actually the length of the semi-major axis (which is half of the longest diameter of the elipse).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the distance from the Sun.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Galileo===
[[Image:Phasesofvenus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Phases of Venus.]]
Galileo Galilei was the first person to use a telescope to look at the night sky. He was able to view many things that weren't visible to the naked eye, such as the imperfectness of the surface of the moon, and the fact that there were many faint stars in the sky. Both of these supported Copernicus' ideas.

====Galileo and Venus====

When Galileo observed Venus with his telescope. he noticed that it went through phases, like the Moon. He also noticed that when Venus was a crescent, it was much larger than when it was full. This observation was evidence that Venus was orbiting around the Sun and not Earth.

====Galileo and Jupiter's Moons====

Galileo also observed four objects orbiting Jupiter, which are now known as the [[w:Galilean moons|Galilean moons]] They supported the view that not everything orbits the Earth.

===Newton's universal law of gravitation===

When Issac Newton created his [[A-level_Physics/Forces%2C_Fields_and_Energy/Gravitational_fields#Newton.27s_ideas_of_gravity|universal law of gravitation]], he attempted to show that Kepler's observations of planetary motion agreed with it. This was significant evidence to show that he was correct.

Newton's law of gravitation can be used to give a formula for the planets in the form &lt;math&gt;T^2 \propto d^3&lt;/math&gt;:

The force of gravitational attraction between the Sun and a planet is equal to the centripetal force required to keep the planet in its orbit:
:&lt;math&gt;F=G\frac {m_1 m_2}{d^2} = \frac{m v^2}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

The period of the planets orbit can be given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Time\ taken = \frac {distance}{velocity}&lt;/math&gt;

Where the distance is the circumference of a circle, &lt;math&gt;2 \pi \times d&lt;/math&gt; (note that ''d'' is distance from Sun, and is therefore the radius, not the diameter). This gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2 \pi d}{v}&lt;/math&gt;

Which we can re-arrange to make ''v'' the subject and substitute into &lt;math&gt;v^2&lt;/math&gt; in the centripetal force equation:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{2 \pi d}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 d^2}{T^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G\frac {m_1 m_2}{d^2} = \frac{4 \pi^2 m d}{T^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating ''m'', the mass of the planet, and tidying up:

:&lt;math&gt;G \frac{m T^2}{4 \pi^2 d^3} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

And finally, making &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt; the subject:

:&lt;math&gt;T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2}{Gm} d^3&lt;/math&gt;

We now have a formula in the form &lt;math&gt;T^2 \propto d^3&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\frac {4 \pi^2}{Gm}&lt;/math&gt; as the constant of proportionality, where ''m'' is the mass of the Sun.

====The discovery of Neptune====

In 1821, Alexis Bouvard published very accurate observations in the orbit of Uranus. However, soon after this, the orbit of Uranus was observed to deviate from the published values. In 1845 John Adams, using Newton's universal law of gravitation, calculated  the orbit of another planet outside of Uranus whose gravity would account for the '''perturbations''' in Uranus' orbit. Neptune was discovered in its predicted position a year later. Pluto was discovered in a similar way, since it was causing further perturbations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.

====Problems encountered with Newton's theory====

Although Newton's theory was very successful in explaining the motion of the planets, and had even been used to discover unknown planets, there were still some problems with it:

*The orbit of Mercury was observed to have a different orbit to the one predicted by the theory. This has now been resolved by Einstein's [[A-level_Physics/Cosmology/Relativity|general theory of relativity]].
*If every object in the universe attracts each other, then the entire universe should have collapsed because of the gravitational attraction. To solve this, Newton came up with the idea that the universe was infinitely large, and that matter was uniformly spread throughout. This led to its own problems, though, namely [[A-level_Physics/Cosmology/Structure of the universe|Olber's paradox]], which states that an infinitely large universe will always have a star on any given line of sight, and so the night sky should actually be bright. This has been resolved with the observations of an [[A-level_Physics/Cosmology/Structure of the universe|expanding universe]] by Edwin Hubble.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists ==

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication research and the development of communication theory.  Information exchange is a basic human function in which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty.  Uncertainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication.  Through the development of URT, these scholars pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty research.

Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153).  The study of information is basic to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical research in the field of interpersonal communication.  URT places the role of communication into the central focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication.  Berger and Calabrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p. 99).  The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of interpersonal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social sciences.

== The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview ==

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field.  Interpersonal communication is most often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology.  Prior to the 1960s, only a modest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication.  Heath and Bryant (2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960, scholars adopted communication as the central term because they wanted to study it as a significant and unique aspect of human behavior” (p. 59).

The 1960s produced research that impacted the development of an interpersonal field.  Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding that psychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems as well.  Research trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved through effective communication (Heath &amp; Bryant, 2000).

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes.  Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005).  Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. 

By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control.  This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut.  During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.  Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416).

Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships.  Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships.  It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975).  Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole.  This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication.  Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

== Defining Uncertainty ==

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied.  One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory.  Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.  Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of URT.

Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider's (1958) research in attribution.  Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave” (p. 100).  The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences.

During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say”

Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relationships.  High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development.  Uncertainty can cause stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of communicator competence (West &amp; Turner, 2000).  Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious to engage in initial interactions.  West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty caused increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking.  In interactions individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions.  When high uncertainty exists it is often difficult to reach this goal.

Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty and predictability can also inhibit a relationship.  Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “Too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship; too much uncertainty raises its costs to an unacceptable level. Relationship building is a dialectic of stability and change, certainty and uncertainty” (p. 271).  Therefore uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.  The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce uncertainly.

== Early Influences ==

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.  The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

=== Leon Festinger (1919-1989)===

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin.  Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication.  After graduation, [[Festinger]] initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics.  After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000).

Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin’s theories.  Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of URT.  Festinger is best known for the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison.  Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual.  Lewin foreshadowed CDT in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982).  CDT allows for three relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another (West &amp; Turner, 2000).  Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and discomfort that individuals seek to reduce.

Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities.  To evaluate the self, the individual usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self.  This need for social comparison can result in conformity pressures (Trenholm &amp; Jensen, 2004).  Berger and Calabrese (1975) related social comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107).

Festinger received the Distinguished Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology.  Festinger’s legacy is significant, and his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research.  Aronson (in Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since” (p. 3).

=== Fritz Heider (1896-1988)===

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz.  During his time in Europe, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Köhler, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Lewin.  Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial impact on his life: “I want to pay tribute to [Lewin's] stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work” (Heider, 1958, p. vii).  In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).

Heider’s 1958 publication, ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations'', signified a major breakthrough in the study of interpersonal communication (Heath &amp; Bryant, 2000).  At this point, social psychologists like Heider expanded their research to focus on interpersonal relations as an important field of study.  Though many social psychologists focused on behavior in interpersonal relations, their research served as a gateway for research examining communication in interpersonal relationships.  Heider’s text provided one of the first forums for discussing relational phenomena.

Heider’s work reflected Lewin’s cognitive approach to behavior.  Heider (1958) focused on theories in cognitive consistency, emphasizing that individuals prefer when their cognitions are in agreement with each other.  Heider examined how individuals perceive and evaluate the actions and behaviors of others, a focus reexamined in Berger and Calabrese’s development of URT.  Heider stated: “persons actively seek to predict and explain the actions of others” (Berger &amp; Bradac, 1982, p. 29).  Heider’s theory of “naïve psychology” suggested that individuals act as observers and analyzers of human behavior in everyday life.  Individuals gather information that helps them to predict and explain human behavior.  “The naïve factor analysis of action permits man to give meaning to action, to influence the actions of others as well as of himself, and to predict future actions” (Heider, 1958, p. 123).  

When examining motivations in interpersonal relations, Heider (1958) found that affective significance is greatly determined by causal attribution.  Heider states: “Thus, our reactions will be different according to whether we think a person failed primarily because he lacked adequate ability or primarily because he did not want to carry out the actions” (1958, p. 123).  The condition of motivation becomes the focus and is relied on for making judgments and also interpreting the action.

Heider was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association, and was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  His influence continues to grow after his death in 1988.

=== Claude E. Shannon (1916-2001) and Warren Weaver (1894-1978)===

Claude E. Shannon received his B.S. from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and his Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Shannon worked for the National Research Council, the National Defense Research Committee, and Bell Telephone Laboratories, where he developed the mathematical theory of communication, now known as information theory, with Warren Weaver.  Shannon went on to teach at MIT until his death in 2001.  During his lifetime Shannon was awarded the Leibmann Prize, Ballantine Medal, Who's Who Life Achievement Prize, and the Kyoto Prize (“Claude Elwood Shannon”, 2002).

Warren Weaver received his B.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin.  Weaver worked as faculty at Throop College, California Institute of Technology, University of Wisconsin, and served in World War One.  Weaver was also an active member of the Rockefeller Foundation, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and Salk Institute for Biological Studies, serving in many leadership roles.  He was awarded UNESCO's Kalinga Prize before his death in 1978 (Reingold, 2000).

Shannon and Weaver significantly contributed to the systematic approach to the study of communication.  Both theorists were engineers who sought to explain information exchange through cybernetic processes.  They were the first to effectively model information, as they sought to explain how to attain precise and efficient signal transmissions in the realm of telecommunications.  In their theory of information, Shannon and Weaver (1949) showed that the need to reduce uncertainty motivates individual’s communication behavior.  This concept was later extended by Berger and Calabrese (1975) in the development of URT. 

Information theory provided the connections from information to uncertainty and uncertainty to communication that facilitated the development of URT.  “Shannon &amp; Weaver’s (1949) approach stressed the conclusion that information is the number of messages needed to totally reduce uncertainty” (Heath &amp; Bryant, 2000, p. 145). Individuals have a desire to reduce uncertainty and they are able to fulfill this need by increasing information.  Individuals increase information through communication (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949).  These concepts are further explored in the examination of information-seeking strategies in URT.

== Uncertainty in the Modern Era ==

=== Charles R. Berger: Biography ===	

Charles R. Berger received his B.S. from Pennsylvania State University and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Michigan State University.  After graduation, Berger worked at Illinois State University at Normal, Northwestern University, and the University of California at Davis, where he continues to work today as the chair of the Department of Communication.  Berger has been involved with the International Communication Association since the 1970s, is an active member of the National Communication Association, and belongs to such professional groups as the American Psychological Society, the Society for Experimental Social Psychology, the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, and the Iowa Network for Personal Relationships (“Charles R. Berger”, 2001).

Berger has published on a variety of topics in interpersonal communication including: uncertainty reduction, strategic interaction, information-seeking, attribution, interpersonal attraction, social cognition, and apprehension.  In the past thirty-five years, Berger has published approximately forty articles appearing in the ''Communication Education, Communication Monographs, Communication Research, Communication Theory, Communication Quarterly, Communication Yearbook, Educational and Psychological Measurement, Human Communication Research, Journal of Communication, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology Journal of Social Issues, Journal of Personality, Personal Relationship Issues, Speech Monographs, Western Journal of Communication,'' and the ''Western Journal of Speech Communication''.  Berger has coauthored five books and contributed to over thirty other texts.  In 1982, Berger received the Golden Anniversary Book Award, presented by the Speech Communication Association, for his text: ''Language and Social Knowledge''. 

=== Richard J. Calabrese: Biography ===

Richard J. Calabrese received his B.A. from Loyola University, two M.A. degrees from Bradley University, and his Ph.D. from Northwestern University.  Calabrese has taught at Bradley University, the University of Illinois at Urban, and Bowling Green University.  Calabrese became a professor in communication at Dominican University in River Forest, Illinois, in 1967, where he continues to work today.  Currently, Calabrese is the director of the Master of Science in Organization Management Program at Dominican University and also a consultant for organizational communication (“Richard Joseph Calabrese”, 2001).

Calabrese is a member of the International Association of Business Communicators, the Speech Communication Association, and is involved with the National Communication Association.  Calabrese is the coauthor of ''Communication and Education Skills for Dietetics Professionals''.

=== A Theory of Uncertainty Reduction: “Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication” (1975). ===

In 1971, Berger became an assistant professor of communication at Northwestern University.  During this time, Calabrese studied under Berger, receiving his Ph.D. in 1973.  In 1975, Berger and Calabrese published “Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication,” which serves as the foundation of URT.  This article inspired a wave of new research examining the role of uncertainty in communication.  Berger and Calabrese (1975) formed URT, also known as initial interaction theory, to explain the role of communication in reducing uncertainty in initial interactions and the development of interpersonal relationships. 

The theory was developed, like other interpersonal theories before it (Heider, 1958), with the goal of allowing the communicator the ability to predict and explain initial interactions.  Though Berger and Calabrese did not explore the realm of subsequent interaction, they did strongly recommend that future research should investigate the application of the framework of URT to developed relationships.  Especially in initial encounters, there exists a high degree of uncertainty given that a number of possible alternatives exist in the situation (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949).  But individuals can use communication to reduce this uncertainty.  Berger and Calabrese (1975) maintained that “communication behavior is one vehicle through which such predictions and explanations are themselves formulated” (p.101).  Individuals have the ability to decrease uncertainty by establishing predictable patterns of interaction.  Because of this, reducing uncertainty can help foster the development of relationships.

Berger and Calabrese (1975) found that uncertainty was related to seven other communication and relational-focused concepts: verbal output, nonverbal warmth, information seeking, self-disclosure, reciprocity, similarity, and liking.  From those concepts, the researchers introduced a collection of axioms, or propositions, supported by past uncertainty research.  Each axiom states a relationship between a communication concept and uncertainty.  From this basis of axioms, the theorists were able to use deductive logic to infer twenty-one theorems that comprise the theory of uncertainty reduction (West &amp; Turner, 2000).  The procedure used to develop the axioms and theorems was adopted from Blalock (1969).  A complete list of the axioms and theorems of URT is available in Appendix A. 

Central to URT is the supposition that in initial interactions, an individual’s primary concern is to decrease uncertainty and increase predictability regarding the behaviors of the self and the communicative partner.  This idea is based on Heider's (1958) notion that individuals seek to make sense out of the events he perceives (Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975).  Individuals must be able to engage in proactive and retroactive strategies to learn how to predict what will happen and also explain what has already happened.

Heath and Bryant (2000) stated: “Uncertainty-reduction theory is a powerful explanation for communication because it operates in all contexts to help explain why people communicate as they do” (p. 271).  The impact of Berger and Calabrese (1975) on the field of interpersonal communication was and continues to be prolific.  In the past thirty years, this article has generated a plethora of research, changing the way that relationships are explored and analyzed.

=== Expansions on Uncertainty Reduction ===

Although URT was primarily formed to explain behavior in initial interactions, its application has since been expanded to incorporate all levels of interpersonal relationships.  “Uncertainties are ongoing in relationships, and thus the process of uncertainty reduction is relevant in developed relationships as well as in initial interactions” (West &amp; Turner, 2000, p. 141).  The following section will examine uncertainty reduction research since its introduction in 1975.

==== A. Charles Berger ====

Since its conception, Berger has produced a plethora of research expanding URT to better fit the dynamic nature of interpersonal relations.  Berger (1979) established that three predeceasing conditions must exist for an individual to reduce uncertainty.  These motivations to reduce uncertainty include: a potential for costs or rewards, deviations from expected behavior, and the possibility of future interaction.

In 1982, Berger teamed up with James J. Bradac, formerly of University of California at Santa Barbara (1980-2004), to publish a book devoted to uncertainty reduction research.  Their text, titled ''Language and Social Knowledge: Uncertainty in Interpersonal Relations'', was also edited by Howard Giles, originator of Communication Accommodation Theory and also faculty of UCSB.  In this text, the authors focused on the function of communication, and specifically language, as a proponent for reducing uncertainty.

Berger and Bradac (1982) proposed six axioms that built on URT’s original seven axioms to extend the relationship between uncertainty reduction and language.  Through the use of these axioms the authors specifically examined the role of language as an uncertainty reducing agent.   The authors further arranged uncertainty into two categories: cognitive uncertainty and behavioural uncertainty (Berger &amp; Bradac, 1982).  Cognitive uncertainty refers to uncertainty associated with beliefs and attitudes.  Behavioural uncertainty refers to uncertainty regarding the possible behaviors in a situation.  This categorization helped researchers identify the origins of uncertainty, which resulted in an increased ability to address the discomfort produced by uncertainty.

Berger and Bradac were cognitive that URT would be more useful if its influence was extended to include developed relationships as well as initial interaction.  Berger and Bradac (1982) alleviated this by stating that uncertainty reduction was critical to relational development, maintenance, and dissolution as well.  Berger again related his research to Heider (1958) by stating that individuals make casual attributions regarding communicative behavior.  As relationships further develop, individuals make retroactive and proactive attributions regarding a partner’s communication and behavior (Berger &amp; Bradac, 1982).  

Berger (1987) highlighted the role of costs and rewards in relationships by stating that “uncertainty reduction is a necessary condition for the definition of the currency of social exchange, and it is through communicative activity that uncertainty is reduced” (Berger, 1987, p. 57).  Berger (1987) also expanded URT by claiming that three types of information-seeking strategies are used to reduce uncertainty: passive, active, or interactive strategies.  This is related to the concepts of information theory (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949), emphasizing that increased information results in decreased uncertainty.

==== B. Developments from Other Researchers ====

The latter improvements made by Berger expanded the scope and value of URT.  Other researchers also made contributions to further developments of URT.  Since its introduction in 1975, URT has been expanded from a theory of relational development to one also important in established relationships. The following sections examine the contributions made by current interpersonal researchers to URT.

; William Douglas
: William Douglas was a student at Northwestern University while Berger was on faculty.  The two scholars collaborated in their study of uncertainty in 1982, and Douglas continued in the same vein of research after graduation.  Douglas’ research has appeared in major communication journals including: ''Communication Monographs, Communication Research, Human Communication Research, Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media'', and the ''Journal of Personal and Social Relationships''.  Douglas’ research in uncertainty accounts for individual differences when examining initial interactions.  Much of his research expanded previous work in initial interaction, examined global uncertainty, self-monitoring, and the relationship of verbal communication to uncertainty reduction.	
: Douglas (1987) examined one of the motivations to reduce uncertainty originally posited in Berger (1979): the anticipation of future interaction.  In this study, question-asking in situations of varying levels of anticipated future interaction was analyzed.  Douglas found that high levels of mutual question-asking occurred when the level of anticipated future interaction was moderate. This finding suggested that individuals seem to avoid negative consequences (Douglas, 1987).  Douglas (1990) expanded this verbal communication to uncertainty relationship by discovering that question-asking resulted in uncertainty reduction which in turn resulted in increased levels of disclosure.		
: Douglas (1991) defines global uncertainty as “uncertainty about acquaintanceship in general” (p. 356).  In this article, Douglas found that individuals with high global uncertainty are less likely to engage in question-asking, self-disclosure, and are evaluated as less competent communicators than individuals with low global uncertainty.  Findings also suggested that high global uncertainty positively correlates to communication apprehension.  This has a negative effect on relational development and can result in low levels of relational satisfaction.		

; Uncertainty-Increasing Events : Sally Planalp and James Honeycutt (1985) also made substantial contributions to uncertainty reduction research.  Planalp and Honeycutt recognized that communication does not always function as an uncertainty reducing agent, but can also serve to increase uncertainty when information conflicts with past knowledge.  The authors researched what specific events lead to increased uncertainty in interpersonal relationships and their effects on both the individual and the relationship.  The results found that uncertainty-increasing events were very likely to result in relational dissolution or decreased closeness of the relational partners.  This research was very beneficial because it led to better explanations regarding the role of communication in uncertainty reduction. 

; Romantic Relationships : Malcolm Parks and Mara Adelman (1983) sought to expand the breadth of URT to apply to romantic relationships.  Data was collected from individuals in premarital romantic relationships through questionnaires and telephone interviews.  Individuals who communicated more often with their romantic partner and their partner’s network (family and friends) perceived greater similarity to their partner.  They also received greater support from their own network (family and friends), and experienced a lower degree of uncertainty (Parks &amp; Adelman, 1983).  These findings support URT’s axioms that greater verbal communication and similarity serve to decrease uncertainty (Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975), and also extends the scope of URT to romantic relationships.

; Relational Maintenance : In recent years, studies have begun to link uncertainty reduction to relational maintenance processes.  Dainton and Aylor (2001) connected relational uncertainty positively to jealousy and negatively to relational maintenance behaviors.  These results suggested that individuals are less likely to engage in relational maintenance when high uncertainty exists in the relationship. 
 
; Cultural Studies : Research conducted by William Gudykunst and Tsukasa Nishida (1984) expanded URT’s scope to intercultural contexts.  Specifically the researchers examined the effects of attitude similarity, cultural similarity, culture, and self-monitoring on attraction, intent to interrogate, intent to self-disclose, attributional confidence, and intent to display nonverbal affiliative behaviors (Gudykunst &amp; Nishida, 1984).   Research conducted on individuals of the Japanese and American cultures found a positive correlation between each of the variables indicating that uncertainty varies across cultures.

==== C. Criticisms of URT ====

Berger (1987) recognized that URT “contains some propositions of dubious validity” (p. 40).  Like many other successful theoretical approaches, Berger and Calabrese’s (1975) theory of uncertainty reduction has inspired subsequent research that served both as supporting evidence and in an oppositional role to the theory.  These criticisms help to clarify the underlying principles of the theory and suggest ways for improvement for future research.

Michael Sunnafrank (1986) argued that a motivation to reduce uncertainty is not a primary concern in initial interactions.  His belief was that a “maximization of relational outcomes” (p. 9) was of more significant concern in initial encounters.  Sunnafrank argued that the predicted outcome value (POV) of the interaction had a greater effect on uncertainty.  Berger (1986) combated Sunnafrank’s arguments by acknowledging that outcomes cannot be predicted if there is no previous history of interaction regarding the behavior of the individuals.  Berger claims that Sunnafrank’s arguments simply expanded URT: that by predicting outcomes (using POV) individuals are actually reducing their uncertainty (Berger, 1986). 

Kathy Kellermann and Rodney Reynolds (1990) also tested the validity of URT.  Their primary concern was axiom three, which related high uncertainty to high information seeking (see appendix A).  Their study of over a thousand students found that a want for knowledge was a greater indicator than a lack of knowledge for promotion of information-seeking (Kellermann &amp; Reynolds, 1990).  These researchers emphasized that high uncertainty does not create enough motivation to result in information-seeking; rather a want for information must also exist.  

Canary and Dainton (2003) explored uncertainty reduction in terms of relational maintenance across cultural contexts and found that the applicability of URT may not hold to multiple cultures.  Canary and Dainton (2003) focused on the concept of uncertainty avoidance in cultures stating: “individuals from cultures with a high tolerance for uncertainty are unlikely to find the experience of uncertainty as a primary motivator for performing relational maintenance” (p. 314).  This leads to a general questioning of validity of URT other cultures.

== Legacy and Influence ==

Research has found that communication plays a critical role in initial interactions and relational development.  Berger and Calabrese (1975) were the first to investigate the role of communication in initial interactions with the development of a theory of uncertainty reduction.  Its widespread influence led to its adoption in other relational and communicative contexts such as small group, mass communication, and computer-mediated communication. 

The influence of URT is well noted by others in the field: “Postulates by Berger and Calabrese prompted more than two decades of research to prove, clarify, and critique uncertainty reduction’s explanation of how people communicate interpersonally” (Heath &amp; Bryant, 2000, p. 275).  Berger and Calabrese (1975) generated additional studies on uncertainty reduction accomplished by such scholars as Hewes, Planalp, Parks, Adelman, Gudykunst, Yang, Nishida, Douglas, Kellerman, Hammer, Rutherford, Honeycutt, Sunnafrank, Capella, Werner, and Baxter.  URT has withstood the test of time, proving itself as a heuristic theory with utility that increases with subsequent research.

== Appendix A: Axioms and Theorems of Uncertainty Reduction Theory ==

=== Axioms of Uncertainty Reduction Theory ===

# Given the high level of uncertainty present at the onset of the entry phase, as the amount of verbal communication between strangers increases, the level of uncertainty for each interactant in the relationship will decrease. As uncertainty is further reduced, the amount of verbal communication will increase.
# As nonverbal affiliative expressiveness increases, uncertainty levels will decrease in an initial interaction situation. In addition, decreases in uncertainty level will cause increases in nonverbal affiliative expressiveness. 
# High levels of uncertainty cause increases in information seeking behavior. As uncertainty levels decline, information seeking behavior decreases. 
# High levels of uncertainty in a relationship cause decreases in the intimacy level of communication content. Low levels of uncertainty produce high levels of intimacy. 
# High levels of uncertainty produce high rates of reciprocity. Low levels of uncertainty produce low reciprocity rates. 
# Similarities between persons reduce uncertainty, while dissimilarities produce increases in uncertainty.
# Increases in uncertainty level produce decreases in liking; decreases in uncertainty level produce increases in liking.

=== Theorems of Uncertainty Reduction Theory ===

# Amount of verbal communication and nonverbal affiliative expressiveness are positively related.
# Amount of communication and intimacy level of communication are positively related.
# Amount of communication and information seeking behavior are inversely related.
# Amount of communication and reciprocity rate are inversely related.
# Amount of communication and liking are positively related.
# Amount of communication and similarity are positively related.
# Nonverbal affiliative expressiveness and intimacy level of communication content are positively related. 
# Nonverbal affiliative expressiveness and information seeking are inversely related. 
# Nonverbal affiliative expressiveness and reciprocity rate are inversely related.
# Nonverbal affiliative expressiveness and liking are positively related.
# Nonverbal affiliative expressiveness and similarity are positively related.
# Intimacy level of communication content and information seeking are inversely related. 
# Intimacy level of communication content and reciprocity rate are inversely related.
# Intimacy level of communication content and liking are positively related.
# Intimacy level of communication content and similarity are positively related. 
# Information seeking and reciprocity rate are positively related. 
# Information seeking and liking are negatively related. 
# Information seeking and similarity are negatively related.
# Reciprocity rate and liking are negatively related. 
# Reciprocity rate and similarity are negatively related.

each section will follow how i am currently being taught. i will draw diagrams in gimp and upload them. i will steal from wherever is nessisary (gpl'ed texts), and include problem sets along with solutions.
as this is materials science, i would advocate different levels of material, levels 1-5 with increasing difficulty. --[[User:Mfadock|Mfadock]] 20:00, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

Materials science is the study of the structural and functional properties of materials. It focuses on the factors inherent within materials that influence their properties. These factors include composition, the structure of the matter within the material and the type and quantity of defects that are present. It is a multidisciplinary subject that draws upon and feeds back to the learning in just about every field of science and engineering in some way or another placing the subject in a central role to many of the activities in these related subjects.

This book is aimed at those studying materials science at the undergraduate level in university whether as their major field or as a single module of a related engineering course.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Digital Circuits Page}}

In the previous chapter we learned what digital information is. Digital information is represented as bits, which can take on values of either 1 or 0. In this chapter we begin to explore how to perform calculations and do other work using digital information.

Much of what we will be discussing was formalized by [[:w:George Boole|George Boole]] (1815–1864) in his paper ''An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities'', published in 1854. It had few applications at the time, but eventually scientists and engineers realized that his system could be used to create efficient computer logic. The branch of mathematics involving digital logic is aptly named Boolean Algebra.

== Basic Operators ==

Digital logic has three basic operators, the AND, the OR and the NOT. These three operators form the basis for everything in digital logic. In fact, almost everything your computer does can be described in terms of these three operations. Fortunately, these operations are not difficult to understand, as their meanings resemble the meanings of the words as used in every day language.

=== AND ===

The symbol for the AND operation is a single dot. A mathematical expression using AND looks like this.

&lt;math&gt;A \cdot B&lt;/math&gt;

The value of an AND expression is 1 only if both input values are 1. Otherwise, the value is 0. That is, the above expression equals 1 if and only if A '''and''' B are 1. The AND operation can be described with the following truth table.

{{Truthtable2|&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;|&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;|&lt;math&gt;A \cdot B&lt;/math&gt;|0|0|0|1}}

=== OR ===

The symbol for the OR operation is a plus sign. A mathematical expression using OR looks like this.

&lt;math&gt;A + B&lt;/math&gt;

The value of an OR expression is 1 when at least of of the input values is 1, and 0 otherwise. That is, the above expression equals 1 if either A '''or''' B is 1. The truth table for the OR operation is as follows.

{{Truthtable2|&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;|&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;|&lt;math&gt;A + B&lt;/math&gt;|0|1|1|1}}

=== NOT ===

NOT is the simplest operation. AND and OR are binary operations, since they require two values as input. NOT is a unary operation, and looks like this.

&lt;math&gt;\lnot A&lt;/math&gt;

The value of a NOT expression is the opposite value of the input value.

{{Truthtable1|&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;|&lt;math&gt;\lnot A&lt;/math&gt;|1|0}}


==NAND and NOR==

If the AND, OR and NOT operators are combined, then the NOR and NAND can be created:
*A NAND B is &lt;math&gt;\overline{A \cdot B}&lt;/math&gt;. This is the inverted output of the AND gate.
*A NOR B is &lt;math&gt;\overline{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;. This is just the inverted output of an OR gate.

{| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; align=center
! NAND !! NOR
|-
|&lt;math&gt;Q=\overline{X \cdot Y}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;Q=\overline{X + Y}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|{{Truthtable2|X|Y|Q|1|1|1|0}}
|{{Truthtable2|X|Y|Q|1|0|0|0}}
|}

==XOR and XNOR==

Two other important gates are the exclusive-OR and exclusive -NOR operators, XOR and XNOR. This is sometimes denoted by a plus sign in a circle.
*A XOR B is &lt;math&gt;\overline{A} \cdot B + A \overline{B} = A \oplus B &lt;/math&gt;. This is true only if exactly one of the inputs is one.
*A XNOR B is &lt;math&gt;\overline{\overline{A} \cdot B + A \overline{B}} = \overline{A \oplus B}&lt;/math&gt;. This is the inverted output of an XOR gate: it is only true if both input are the same.

{| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; align=center
! XOR !! XNOR
|-
|&lt;math&gt;Q={X \oplus Y}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;Q=\overline{X \oplus Y}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|{{Truthtable2|X|Y|Q|0|1|1|0}}
|{{Truthtable2|X|Y|Q|1|0|0|1}}
|}

XOR represents a modulo-2 addition, which means that if you add 1 to 1, you wrap around back to 0. This is very useful function in digital electronics, but it is not an important concept in Boolean algebra.

==Formal Mathematical Operators==

In the field of logic, which is part of discrete mathematics, there is an alternative notation to the addition/multiplication type we have seen:

*AND is represented by &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; Therefore &lt;tt&gt;A AND B&lt;tt&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;.
*OR is represented by &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; Therefore &lt;tt&gt;A OR B&lt;tt&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;A \vee B&lt;/math&gt;.
*NOT is represented by &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;tt&gt;NOT A&lt;tt&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\neg A&lt;/math&gt;.

Unfortunately, computer science, engineering and mathematics seem unable to establish a consensus, so we are stuck with both forms of notation.  Other books, and especially those that deal more with pure logic or discrete mathematics may have various notations, so if other books are consulted, then the other notation needs to be known. As this is an engineering book, we will not use this notation.

==Boolean Algebra Laws==

Boolean Algebra, like regular algebra, has certain rules. These rules are Associativity, Distributivity, Commutativity and De Morgan's Laws. Associativity, Commutativity and Distributivity only apply to the AND and OR operators. Some of these laws may seem trivial because you are so used to them. However, when Boolean algebra was created with its different rules, every axiom we take for granted in &quot;normal&quot; algebra no longer was guaranteed to apply. These laws have been proved to hold under Boolean algebra.

====Associativity====
{{Wikipedia|Associativity}}
Associativity is the property of algebra that the order of evaluation of the terms is immaterial.

:&lt;math&gt;A+(B+C) \iff (A+B)+C \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A \cdot(B \cdot C) \iff (A\cdot B) \cdot C \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Distributivity====
{{Wikipedia|Distributivity}}
Distibutivity is the property that an operator can be applied to each of the terms within the brackets.

:&lt;math&gt;A \cdot (B+C) \iff (A \cdot B)+(A \cdot C) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A+(B \cdot C ) \iff (A+B) \cdot (A + C) \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Commutativity====
{{Wikipedia|Commutativity}}
Commutativity is the property that order of application of an operator is immaterial.
:&lt;math&gt;A \cdot B \iff B \cdot A \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A+B \iff B+A \,&lt;/math&gt;

====De Morgan's Law====
{{Wikipedia|De Morgan's Law}}
De Morgan's Law is a consequence of the fact that the NOT or negation operator is not distributive.

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P \cdot Q} \iff \overline {P}+ \overline {Q}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P+Q} \iff \overline {P} \cdot \overline {Q}&lt;/math&gt;

De Morgan's laws (named after [[:w:Augustus De Morgan|Augustus De Morgan]], 1806–1871) tell us that a NAND gate gives the same output as an OR gate with inputs complemented and a NOR gate gives the same output as an AND gate with outputs complemented. These complemented-input gates are also known as bubbled gates because of the way that they are indicated on a symbol, i.e., by including a small 'bubble' on each input, in the same fashion that circles are drawn on the outputs of the NOT, NAND and NOR gates.

De Morgan's laws are the most useful while simplifying a boolean expression. An easy way to remember these laws is &quot;Change the sign, break the line&quot;.

{{Digital Circuits/Exercise

===Operator precedence===
It is important to note that
:&lt;math&gt;A.B+C \ne A.(B+C)&lt;/math&gt;
This can be seen as either AND having a higher precedence or the fact that associativity does not hold between AND and OR or that it is an invalid application of distributivity.

Another way of looking at this is the application of our understanding of normal algebra, where the analogy between OR being addition and AND being multiplication is made.  We would never make this error if this were normal algebra with numbers rather than Boolean entities.

===Other Rules===

All of these laws result in a number of rules that apply to all Boolean expressions. These laws have names, but it is only important that you are able to apply them where needed! Note that many rules have two forms - this called duality, and we will discuss it later.

| 5a ||rowspan = 2 | Absorption ||&lt;math&gt;A+(A \cdot B) = A \,&lt;/math&gt; 
|-

|-

|-
| 7a || rowspan = 2 | Consensus Theorem ||&lt;math&gt;A\cdot B+\overline{A}\cdot C + B\cdot C = A\cdot B + \overline{A}\cdot C&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 7b || &lt;math&gt;(A+B)\cdot (\overline{A}+C) \cdot (B+C) = (A+B)\cdot (\overline{A}+C)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Principle of Duality===
The principle of duality tells us: If, in a boolean equation, we interchange the AND and OR operators and interchange '0' with '1' then the resultant boolean equation is also true.

;Example 1:
:If we are aware that &lt;tt&gt;A.(B+C)=(A.B)+(A.C)&lt;/tt&gt; (law of distributivity of the AND operator) then by the principle of duality, we can say that &lt;tt&gt;A+(B.C)=(A+B).(A+C)&lt;/tt&gt; (law of distributivity of the OR operator).

;Example 2:
:Consider the identity law for the OR operator: &lt;tt&gt;A+0=A &lt;/tt&gt;. Applying duality, we get the identity law for the AND operator: &lt;tt&gt;A·1=A&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Boolean Simplification==

It is often the case that you want to simplify a given Boolean function. For example, you might want to reduce the number of logic gates required to implement that particular function. Simplification is done by repeated application of the rules and laws of Boolean algebra. Bear in mind that you sometimes have to apply them backwards to get the minimal form. NAND, NOR, XOR and XNOR all need to be expanded to just AND, OR and NOT in order for simplification to work.

[[Digital Circuits/Karnaugh Maps|Karnaugh Maps]] are a more formal way of doing this for the guaranteed smallest form, but we will do it by hand for now.

===Examples===

Simplify the following expressions.
#&lt;math&gt;B.A. \overline {A}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A. \overline {B} + A.B&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 1====

Using rule 4b, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;B \cdot 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This is directly rule 5, so &lt;math&gt;B.A. \bar {A} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 2====

Using distributivity, we can take A out of the brackets, giving 
:&lt;math&gt;A \cdot (\overline{B} + B)&lt;/math&gt;

Using rule 4a, we see that:
:&lt;math&gt;A \cdot 1 = A&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore see that &lt;math&gt;A. \overline {B} + A.B = A&lt;/math&gt;

== Subjunctive ^_^ ==

It's actually quite simple.

The present tense through future tenses use the present stem. I'm using the word amo, amare, amavi, amatus - to love, so the present stem is &quot;am&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Present:&lt;br /&gt;
1st person: amo'''r'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;              1st person (pl): ama'''mur'''   &lt;br /&gt;
2nd person: ama'''ris'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            2nd person (pl): ama'''mini'''   &lt;br /&gt;
3rd person: ama'''tur'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            3rd person (pl): ama'''ntur'''  &lt;br /&gt;

Imperfect:&lt;br /&gt;
1st person: amaba'''r'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;              1st person (pl): amaba'''mur'''   &lt;br /&gt;
2nd person: amaba'''ris'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            2nd person (pl): amaba'''mini'''   &lt;br /&gt;
3rd person: amaba'''tur'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            3rd person (pl): amaba'''ntur'''  &lt;br /&gt;

Future:&lt;br /&gt;
1st person: amabo'''r'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;              1st person (pl): amabi'''mur'''   &lt;br /&gt;
2nd person: amabe'''ris'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            2nd person (pl): amabi'''mini'''   &lt;br /&gt;
3rd person: amabi'''tur'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            3rd person (pl): amabu'''ntur'''  &lt;br /&gt;

For the perfect verbs, use the fourth principle part. Then, add the correct form of &quot;to be&quot;. For perfect, you use the present to-be verb (sum, es, est...). For pluperfect, you use the imperfect (eram, eras, erat...) and for future perfect, you use the future tense. (ero, eris, erit)We're continuing with amo. Don't forget to make the usual &quot;us&quot; ending of your verb into an &quot;i&quot; when you're doing plurals.&lt;br /&gt;

Perfect:&lt;br /&gt;
1st person: amatus sum&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;           1st person (pl): amati sumus  &lt;br /&gt;
2nd person: amatus es&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;             2nd person (pl): amati estis &lt;br /&gt;
3rd person: amatus est&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            3rd person (pl): amati sunt&lt;br /&gt;

Pluperfect:&lt;br /&gt;
1st person: amatus eram&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;           1st person (pl): amati eramus &lt;br /&gt;
2nd person: amatus eras&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;           2nd person (pl): amati eratis&lt;br /&gt;
3rd person: amatus erat&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;           3rd person (pl): amati erant&lt;br /&gt;

Future Perfect:&lt;br /&gt;
1st person: amatus ero&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            1st person (pl): amati erimus&lt;br /&gt;
2nd person: amatus eris&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;           2nd person (pl): amati eritis&lt;br /&gt;
3rd person: amatus erit&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;           3rd person (pl): amati erunt&lt;br /&gt;

Hope this is all correct and helps!&lt;br /&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">VB.NET supports a number of data structures called Collections. Collection can be either zero or one based, depending on how they are declared. A collection is similar to an array in that it can store multiple data entries. However, most collections have advanced methods associated with them that distinguish them from [[../Arrays|Arrays]]. Some of these collections are:

== ArrayList ==
An ArrayList is a dynamic array, the size increases and shrinks when needed and stores elements as generic Object's, this provides us with the ability to store objects with differing types.

=== Add method ===
To add objects to the ArrayList use the System.Collections.ArrayList.Add(Object) method
The following is an example of adding String objects to an Arraylist.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
   Module Module1
   Sub Main()

       Dim MyArrayList As System.Collections.ArrayList = New ArrayList()
       MyArrayList.add(New String(&quot;a&quot;))
       MyArrayList.add(New String(&quot;b&quot;))
       MyArrayList.add(New String(&quot;c&quot;))
       MyArrayList.add(New String(&quot;d&quot;))
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()

   End Sub
   End Module
&lt;/source&gt;

== Queue ==
A queue is a [[w:FIFO|first-in/first-out]] style collection. A queue has two unique methods used to enqueue and dequeue information from it. Using the System.Collections.Queue.Enqueue method, an object can be added to the end of the collection. Items can later be removed using the System.Collections.Queue.Dequeue method. This method will take the first object in the queue collection and then remove it from that collection.

== Stack ==
[[Image:Programming-stack.png|float|right]]
A stack is a [[w:LIFO (computing)|last-in/first-out]] style collection. A stack has three unique methods used to store and retrieve information from it. Using the System.Collections.Stack.Push method, an object can be added to the top of the stack, pushing the objects below it lower into the stack. Items can later be removed from the stack using the System.Collections.Stack.Pop method. This method will return the object at the top of the stack and remove it from the stack. Another method, System.Collections.Stack.Peek, is similar to the Pop method except it returns the object ''without'' removing it from the stack.

== SortedList ==
A SortedList collection is a collection of objects that are sorted both by index (similar to an array) and by key. A key works in a manner similar to that of an index; however, unlike an index, a key can be any object.

== Generics ==
Generics provide data structures that work for a variety of data types.  While the collections discussed above store items as objects, generic collections store the values in a more specific type such as String or Integer.
===List===
A List(Of Type) allows a set of values to be accessed by index or as a collection. You can therefore mix array and collection syntax on the same set:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
       Dim Weekdays As New List(Of String)
       Weekdays.Add(&quot;Monday&quot;)
       Weekdays.Add(&quot;Tuesday&quot;)
       Weekdays.Add(&quot;Wednesday&quot;)
       Weekdays.Add(&quot;Thursday&quot;)
       Weekdays.Add(&quot;Friday&quot;)
       
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Accessing members by index...&quot;)
       For i As Integer = Weekdays.Count - 1 To 0 Step -1
           Console.WriteLine(Weekdays(i))
       Next i
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Accessing members as a collection...&quot;)
       For Each s As String In Weekdays
           Console.WriteLine(s)
       Next s
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Puzzles]] | [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles|Logic puzzles]] | Niki the Robot
----

Niki, the robot, lives on a chessboard with 8 by 8 squares. At any time Niki has a defined orientation looking either west (&lt;), north (^), east (&gt;) or south (v) and uniquely lives on one of the squares. Niki can be programmed by a sequence of the following commands:

----
&lt;pre&gt;
move'n'pick
&lt;/pre&gt;
Moves one square in the current direction and picks up an item, if present. Items are denoted with '*' on the board.

&lt;pre&gt;
turn right
&lt;/pre&gt;
Changes the direction of niki clockwise.

&lt;pre&gt;
goto LABEL if wall
&lt;/pre&gt;
LABEL can designate the position of any of the commands listed before this one in the program, i.e. the branch can only be upwards in the program. The command branches there if right ahead of Niki there is a wall, which means the border of the board or a wall between squares denoted with 'W'. Otherwise the next command is being executed.
----

If Niki moves and a wall is ahead, nothing happens.

=== Problem 1 ===

Niki looks east.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Most of these commands don't have anything to do with Bash. They are just command line programs that can run in any shell (like ksh or tcsh). --[[User:Sbenza|SamSam]] 01:06, 28 October 2005 (UTC)
::A few of them are Bash or Bourne shell builtins. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:44, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

==Merge/move proposal==
I suggest merging this into [[Guide to UNIX/Commands]], where I am already contributing. It already has some Linux-specific commands (lsmod, modprobe) and at least one builtin command (cd). One idea might be to move this page to Guide to UNIX/Commands/Index, then wait for contributors to link commands to their descriptions. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:44, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

== Man to wiki ==

Since the man pages for the gnu commands are also GPL, is it reasonable to have a bot creating wiki pages from man pages? --[[User:Sbenza|SamSam]] 20:43, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:Most of the GNU &quot;man&quot; manuals (like [http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?manpath=linux&amp;query=ls ls]) refer you to the &quot;info&quot; manuals (like [http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html coreutils]). By the texinfo source of the coreutils manual, I read, ''Permission is granted to copy, distribute, and/or modify this document under the terms of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]... with no Invariant Sections, with no Front-Cover Texts, and with no Back-Cover Texts.'' This statement seems compatible with [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]].

:At one point I considered taking text from the coreutils manual to fill in missing commands for [[Guide to UNIX/Commands]]. I decided against this. Instead, I am planning to make links to the coreutils manual on GNU's web site, the various *BSD manual pages, and the [[lqwiki:|Linux Questions wiki]].

:However, you, or other contributors, might take text from GNU manuals. In this case, the [[GFDL]] section 4 item I seems to require the creation of a &quot;History&quot; section describing how the GNU version and then the modified Wikibooks version was made. (If you, or other contributors, do not want to modify the GNU manual text, but want it in wiki format, then [[wikisource:|Wikisource]] might be a better place.)

:However, many GNU manuals contain Invariant Sections or Cover Texts. In these cases, they seem to be incompatible with [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]], and cannot be used on Wikibooks. This includes the gcc and emacs manuals. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:00, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

==Aditional command and enchement proposal==
===commands===
i'm unshure that they belongs to coreutils but i've founded on all my systems(gentoo,qtopia embedd,knoppix)

-wget (downloader)

-losetup(link a file to a dev in order to mount loop files (ex:/knoppix.img to /dev/loop/0))

-md5sum

==enchement proposal==
why not making a command line tutorial with the folowing things:
the | that is a pipe
the &gt; that write the data to a file
etc...
and a link to a bash script programing guide at the end of this book
and use this guide as in introduction for the bash script programing guide</text>

* How can you have one third plus two thirds PLUS four percent of the population ?!? A population of 104% it's too much, isn't?

1/3 and 2/3 are understood as approximate. It's not like it's a big deal. &quot;every year 21 babies are born&quot; was a big deal until I figured out that was for every 1000 population, which was not obvious from the way it was phrased. A much, much bigger deal was the 81% of the population works, which is just dumb. That's simply not the way employment statistics works. Just because there's 18% unemployment doesn't mean there's 81% employment, let alone that 81% ''of the population'' works.

And this is to say nothing of the white supremacist racism which I've ripped out of there pronto. Or the revisionist &quot;Hugo Chavez is responsible for the actions of his enemies&quot; which just makes me want to puke. [[User:70.26.56.242|70.26.56.242]] 20:51, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">You may've read or heard people say that your '''weight''' would be different on the Moon, or on other planets and their moons. Does this mean that when you leave the Earth you somehow become fatter or thinner, without gorging on food or going on a diet? &amp;nbsp;Hopefully you'll be glad to hear the answer is no! &amp;nbsp;Here's why:

=== Gravity ===
Have you ever wondered why everything on the Earth doesn't just float up into the sky and off into space? &amp;nbsp;Or perhaps why you land back on the ground whenever you jump up?

So far as we know, everything in the universe tries to pull on everything else. This pull is what's known as '''gravity'''. It's very weak, but it becomes stronger as things get closer together and when any of them are very bulky. The more bulky something is, the more it pulls on other things around it.

We're all living on the Earth, which is very bulky compared to each of us, so it pulls on each of us very strongly. That's why we don't all float away from the Earth and why we come back down to the ground whenever we jump up. We each pull on the Earth, but, as each of us is tiny compared to the Earth, our pull on the Earth is tiny too.

Other places in our Solar System and the rest of the universe are more or less bulky than the Earth, so their gravity is more or less than that here on Earth. So, if we leave the Earth and visit them, their pull on us will be more or less than that we know here on Earth. The Moon, for example, is &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; bulky than the Earth, so if you weighed yourself there with a bathroom scale, it would say you weighed &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; than when you weighed yourself with it on the Earth. This is why people say your weight is different at different places in the Solar System or the rest of the universe! &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; haven't changed &amp;ndash; what's changed is the strength of the gravity keeping you on the surface of whatever place you're visiting.
----
{''Mention planet and comet formation?''}
----

=== Orbits and weightlessness ===

You don't even have to travel that far from the Earth to experience this change. If you travel fast enough around it, the Earth's surface will keep curving away from you as fast as Earth's gravity pulls you toward it. You'll keep going round and round the Earth, never getting any closer to it. This is called orbiting the Earth and the path you follow around the Earth is called an '''orbit'''. Since you don't get any closer to the Earth, it's as if the Earth is no longer pulling on you and so you have no weight &amp;mdash; you're '''weightless'''.

The same is true if you travel fast enough around anything else in the universe. The speed you'll need depends on how bulky it is and how far away you are from it.

mass in science does not mean weight! weight is mass times acceleration due to gravity. or in formula form w=9.8m/s₂*m
so to figure weight all you do is the mass of an object times 9.8m/s₂ 

Alexa J. an8th grader


I happened by this module and was astonished by its opening sentence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This is a myth-busting section to help you avoid getting confused about what it means to talk about your ''mass, or the more commonly used term for this, weight'', on another planet.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If this module is meant to be &quot;myth-busting&quot;, it surely must not start with something that can read as ''confirming'' the very misunderstanding it is setting out to undo, viz that 'mass' and 'weight' are interchangeable terms and concepts! (see italics)

I read further and was dismayed to see that the article fell into this trap by the third paragraph of the 'What are mass and gravity?&quot; section. Note the shift from referring to mass to referring to weight (underlined):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;People used to think that that if you dropped a &lt;u&gt;massive&lt;/u&gt; object (like a canon ball) from a height that it would fall to Earth more quickly than a &lt;u&gt;li&lt;/u&gt;g&lt;u&gt;hter&lt;/u&gt; object (such as a ball bearing)...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, as mentioned in the [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#Leaning Tower of Pisa|Leaning Tower of Pisa]] thread above, the Leaning Tower of Pisa story is unsubstantiated (and most likely apocryphal).

Wishing to remove these errors and clarify the material, I've tried rewriting the opening two sections. I hope I have kept them sufficiently straightforward and that people find my contribution helpful. I plan to review the remaining sections soon.

I think this Wikijunior book could be great and I look forward to sharing it with my niece in the not-too-distant future.

Best wishes,&lt;/br&gt;

:Did you actually read any of the authorities cited above, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]]?  Obviously not.

:What you need to distinguish is mass and force.  ''Weight'' is an ambiguous word; it can be either mass (in its physics jargon meaning, not, for example, what a bodybuilder refers to in discussing muscle mass, and not a church service either) or certain particular kinds of force (but not forces such as the thrust of a rocket or the tension due to a spring or rubber band).

:Of course, that isn't the only word which has more than one meaning.  Kids age 8-11 may well know the word &quot;massive&quot;, but they're likely to know it in the meanings related to occupying a large volume, or a large part of their field of view, not in the technical jargon meaning common in college physics.  You'd have a hard time convincing them at this stage that an ant, or a bacterium,  is &quot;massive&quot;&amp;mdash;and most of their parents will also think you are off your rocker if you make that claim.

Thank you for your prompt response.

I have read the authorities cited above. I am trying to keep in mind, however, that this module is in a science-based book meant for young people. It is an opportunity to introduce (or confirm) the distinction science makes between mass and weight, before the ambiguous or metaphorical uses of these terms in common parlance and literature instil any confusion. I have reviewed the module's opening statement and hope it satisifies your point.

I note your mention of force above and inclusion at the end of [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#What are mass and gravity?|What are mass and gravity?]] ¶2. Force is a concept that is also prone to variable use and meaning outside science. Since I believe it is possible to write the module's opening sections without referring to it directly, I chose to do so in order to keep the content as straightforward as possible. I have simply adopted the use of &quot;pull&quot; that was already in place before I edited [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#What are mass and gravity?|What are mass and gravity?]] ¶2. The same applies as regards avoiding the term &quot;inertia&quot; or the verb &quot;accelerate&quot;.

I also use &quot;move&quot; rather than &quot;speed up&quot; (or &quot;accelerate&quot;) as I can imagine a young person thinking that in order for something to speed up it must already be moving.

I agree that my use of &quot;massive&quot; is probably too adult; thank you for pointing this out. I also remembered that it has that rap/hip-hop slang sense of &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;a gang or collective&quot;. Rest assured that I don't see myself trying to convince anyone that an ant or bacterium is &quot;massive&quot;.

On re-reading the [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#What are mass and gravity?|What are mass and gravity?]] section, I was unconvinced by the &quot;There is always a balance between...&quot; sentence. I've now amended it, but am still not wholly convinced. What's being implied is the proportionality between forces and masses, but &quot;proportionality&quot; is a long word and another concept...

:You don't seem to understand that it isn't the normal usage, the usage those children are going to be most familiar with, which &quot;instills confusion&quot;.  That normal usage is quite legitimate and proper, well justified in history, in linguistics, and in the law.

:Speaking of confusion, there wouldn't be any chance that you yourself would be so confused as to think that when my ketchup bottle has a &quot;net weight&quot; of &quot;24 oz (1 lb 8 oz) 680 g&quot;, that any of those units either '''are''' or '''should be''' units of force, are you?  Or that a gold bar with a &quot;troy weight&quot; of 402.09 oz would have a ''different'' weight in Hammerfest, Norway than it would in Quito, Ecuador? The troy ounce is a &quot;unit of weight&quot; isn't it, as almost any dictionary will tell you?  But there is not, and never has been a troy ounce force.  It isn't is any different, of course, if that gold bar's weight is expressed as 12.5064 kg as is stamped on the top one in the pile shown here.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Gold_ingots.jpg]  Gold buyers and sellers wouldn't be silly enough to weigh their gold in newtons, or in pounds-force.

:Because if you don't understand those basic facts, then you are the one likely to instill confusion.  You can make the point that in the sciences the sciences, the word &quot;weight&quot; is often limited to a different meaning than what these children are most accustomed to, and that they as well as grownups often use various meanings of the word without having the distinctions clear in their own minds.  But just remember, we are fortunate that nobody ever gave any high school chemistry teacher or college physics professor any say-so as to what the word ''weight'' means when we buy and sell salt or gold or platinum or diamonds (''carat weight'', where one carat is exactly 1/5 gram) or anything else.  Nor in the medical sciences, when the doctor or nurse measures our body weight, and uses it to calculate our BMI.

:Furthermore, those who use it that way own this word; they have the prior claim to it, by a long shot.  They've been using this English word that way for over a thousand years, back into the &quot;Old English&quot; days.  It is the newer, spinoff variant that &quot;instills confusion&quot;; a meaning that only showed up on the scene about 275 years ago.

:The use of the term ''weight'' is much more uniform and consistent and correct within commerce in general than it is in science in general.  That Canadian standard above got it right, using &quot;nearly always&quot; in describing the former context, and the weaker terminology &quot;primarily&quot; in connection with science and technology.

:Consider, for example, that agricultural scientists in the U.S. and Canada (yes, today) often use &quot;bushels by weight&quot; in publishing the yields of different varieties on their test plots, and measure the quality of various grains and legumes and oilseeds using a &quot;1,000 kernel weight&quot; in grams.  Biologists and paleontologists measure the ''body weight'' of animals in the same way that medical doctors do, using the same units (in metric units, they use the proper SI units:  '''always''' grams or kilograms (occasionally metric tons), never kilonewtons and the like).

:I'll leave it to you to check out things like &quot;atomic weight&quot;, &quot;formula weight&quot;, &quot;gram-equivalent weight&quot;, and the like. And abbbreviations such as &quot;at. wt.&quot;, common on many of the zillions of Periodic Tables of the Elements found on the internet, many on the sites of colleges and universities around the world.

:It isn't your car mechanic, or your hairdresser, or a long-haul truck driver, or the butcher, the baker, or the candlestick maker, who are going to use terms such as &quot;molecular weight&quot; and &quot;atomic weight&quot; in connection with their work.  They are only used in connection with the sciences such as chemistry and physics.

:NASA, of course, tells us that the &quot;weight&quot; of the Apollo 11 lunar module, at liftoff of its ascent stage, was 10,776.6 pounds. (See NASA's [http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-37_Selected_Mission_Weights.htm Selected Mission Weights] page; other sources will tell you that this liftoff was accomplished with a thrust of about 3,500 pounds-force, which may help you understand the meaning NASA uses here.)  You can find lots of other use of weight with the same meaning as ''mass'' has in physics jargon among rocket scientists and engineers.

:On to other things:  It takes no force to &quot;move&quot; something, or more precisely, to keep it moving. That is an all-too-common misconception; we don't need to reinforce that incorrect idea in the minds of these children. The force is needed only to accelerate it, or to overcome some other force that is accelerating it in a different direction from the direction in which it is moving, such as friction (but we are ignoring air resistance in the examples, so that doesn't apply). 

:Force isn't the word you need to avoid; much better to avoid the ambiguous word &quot;weight&quot;.  Of the various meanings of force, there is usually only one of them which we measure and assign a numerical value; there isn't any real difficulty in either using that word or making it clear what we mean by it.

Thank you for your latest thoughts.

I appreciate your concern that a (young) reader is likely to have had the notions of mass and weight conflated through everyday use and so may be unsettled to read that, as regards science, they are distinct attributes. In view of this I have therefore amended the opening paragraph.

No, I don't think the weight of a ketchup bottle or the other objects you mention need be described in units of force, as usually they exist in the same relatively strong (and near-uniform) gravitational field. If they are taken from the Earth to another body in the universe, however, they may once again exist in a relatively strong gravitational field, but it won't be the same strength as that of the Earth. Hence their weight - which still need not be measured in units of force - will not be the same as before. This module is in a book about our solar system, about bodies with gravitational fields whose strengths differ from that of the Earth, so surely the distinction between mass and weight is pertinent?

I agree that my phrasing &quot;takes more/less effort to move&quot; in [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#What are mass and gravity?|What are mass and gravity?]] ¶4 might be read as implying that, friction aside, force is constantly required to keep something moving. Thank you for pointing this out. I hope my amendments suffice.

[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 02:44, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

:Conflated?  That isn't exactly the proper description of what happens.
:There are indeed two &quot;distinct attributes&quot; involved here.
:But a &quot;difference&quot; between weight and mass isn't something that '''just exists'''.  It needs to be created; there is no God-given meaning assigned to our ''words''.
:The questions here are matters of history and of the law.  The science involved here is '''semantics''', a branch of the science of '''linguistics''', not astronomy (and also not chemistry, not physics).
:That &quot;difference&quot; can, of course, be created, within the limited jargon usage of a particular book, even a particular classroom, and to a lesser extent within some broader field of activity.  That doesn't mean that the difference exists outside that context, however.
:Beyond that, what is it that you don't understand about millions of uses '''in science''' of the word ''weight'' with the very same meaning that ''mass'' usually has in physics jargon?   Is it just that you don't know what &quot;molecular weight&quot; means, that you don't know what the weight in grams of 1,000 kernels of wheat means, you don't know what an &quot;egg weight&quot; of 65 g ([[w:Welsumer]]) means, etc.?  You didn't address that point at all. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 14:56, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

Hello again.

I too believe &quot;there is no God-given meaning assigned to [] words&quot;. I appreciate that people come to use the words 'mass' and 'weight' interchangeably because almost all of us spend almost all our lives in the same, effectively constant circumstance: Earth's gravitational field. But the distinction between mass and weight becomes pertinent as soon as this circumstance can no longer be assumed - when, for example, other planets in our solar system are considered, as they are in this book.

I hope this clarifies how I addressed your point in my previous message (&quot;No, I don't think the weight of a ketchup bottle or the other objects you mention need be described in units of force, as usually they exist in the same relatively strong (and near-uniform) gravitational field.&quot;).

::BTW, thanks for making it abundantly clear that there are cases in which confusion has already been instilled in some people, with your confused ramblings about the ketchup bottle.  The strength of the gravitational field is totally irrelevant; 1 lb 8 oz of ketchup on Earth is still 1 lb 8 oz of ketchup on Mars, and 680 g of ketchup on Earth is still 680 g of ketchup on Mars.  That's just as it should be.  If that weight &quot;still need not be measured in units of force&quot; (as you said above), just how in the world are you imagining that that weight &quot;will not be the same as before&quot;?   In fact, it is actually stronger than &quot;need not&quot;; it is &quot;ought not&quot;.  It certainly wouldn't be pertinent to claim that the net weight of that bottle of ketchup would change, would it?  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 16:19, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

The mass of the ketchup would remain the same, but its weight would change. I believe this is meant to be the point of the module.

If I recall correctly, Mars' gravitational field is around a third that of the Earth, so a weight of 1 lb 8 oz of ketchup on Earth would become 8 oz on Mars and a weight of 680 g would become about 227 g.

What someone measures with scales is weight, even if (thanks to their Earth-bound circumstance) they also then equate that measurement with mass. One way to measure the mass of an object regardless of gravity is to multiply the object's volume by its density.

[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 23:44, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

:You can certainly '''choose not to''' call this quantity of ketchup ''weight'', if you so desire.  But that is '''your only option.'''
:Note also that your making this choice will not affect the meaning of the word ''weight'' when someone else uses it in this context.  Nor will your making this choice give you any standing that they are making some kind of error in doing so.
:It is '''not a legitimate alternative''' for you to continue to call the quantity we measure in the sale of ketchup or gold or anything else by the name ''weight'', but to misapply a definition of this ambiguous word which is incorrect in that context.

:Most 10 years olds should already know enough to have great difficulty with your claim that 680 g on the Earth would be 227 g on Mars.  It is a little different with pounds--those Fred Flintstone units are like obsolete software, no longer fully supported and updated.  Like that old software, they will probably continue to work for your own use for some time, but if you eventually want to communicate with the rest of the world, they might fall short.  With the metric units, the keepers of our standards have been telling us for 45 years to stop using kilograms-force, and they are finally disappearing.  However, nobody is ever going to bother to tell us to stop using pounds-force without telling us to use pounds of any kind.  That doesn't really matter much to this discussion, however; we do not and never have used pounds-force in the sale of goods by weight.

:You also seem to have no understanding whatsoever of how balances work, and you appear totally clueless about the way in which the scales used in commerce are tested and certified for that use.  See, e.g., [[w:weighing scale]].
:There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that if you are accused of giving short weight, some government weights and measures official would mistakenly measure force instead of mass in determining whether legal charges should be brought against you. 
:Note also that while the law does define a pound as 0.45359237 kg exactly (see U.S. version above), it does not define a pound force.  Now ask yourself, &quot;Why in the world does the law bother to define a pound in the first place?&quot;  It is, of course, for the protectionof consumers, as a tool to help keep merchants honest.   The law quite properly defines the units we can legally use for that purpose (grams and kilograms and pounds and ounces in the United States, for example).

::I think our discussion hinges on what you, I and scientists make of the following scenario.

::We are on Earth and have an object, say a bottle of ketchup. We place it on one side of a balance - a comparator - and then see how many identical blocks need to be placed on the other side of the comparator to achieve equilibrium. Let's say it's five.

::We then take a spring and measure its length whilst unstretched; let's say it's nine units. We hang the bottle of ketchup from it and find the length of the spring is now (say) twelve units.

::We travel to Mars with the bottle of ketchup, the comparator, the blocks and the spring. On Mars we place the bottle of ketchup on one side of the comparator and find that the number of blocks needed on the other side to achieve an equilibrium is...? I - and I believe you and the scientists - would say five.

::We take the spring and - I hope you agree - find its length whilst unstretched is still nine units. We hang the bottle of ketchup from it and find the length of the spring is now...? Because Mars' gravitational field is about a third that of the Earth, I - and I believe scientists - would say &lt;i&gt;ten&lt;/i&gt; units, not twelve. What do you say?

::The comparator is measuring (more accurately, comparing) mass, whereas the spring is measuring weight. The mass remains constant between the Earth and Mars (and elsewhere). The weight changes. I believe this is significant in a book about celestial bodies, especially one to be read by young people.

:::The real question is, which of those measurements likely to meet the requirements of the law when it comes to selling ketchup (or gold or whatever) '''by weight'''.  We only need to look at what is actually done for measurements on the Earth today; there are significant variations in the strength of the gravitational field on Earth.  Even if you limit yourself to ''sea level'' on Earth, the variation is 0.53%, more than one part in 190, and there are variations with elevation wrt to sea level as well as with latitude.  It would certainly make a difference if force were measured rather than mass if you were buying or selling a 400 oz t bar of platinum, wouldn't it?  Or those 12½ kg gold bars I mentioned earlier, measured to the nearest 100 milligrams?  Your homework:  If that top gold bar weighs 12.5064 kg, how much force would it exert due to gravity at Hammerfest, Norway?  How much force would it exert due to gravity at Quito, Ecuador?  Any units of force you like, to however many significant digits (can't be more than six) you can get.

:::In fact, many spring scales have &quot;NOT LEGAL FOR TRADE&quot; or words of similar import right on their face.  A few spring scales are legal for trade, but they must be tested and certified before they can legally be used.  The same applies, of course, to any other kind of scale, including piezoelectric load cell devices or whatever.  Some of you probably remember those old Toledo Scale Company scales, with the motto &quot;HONEST WEIGHT:  NO SPRINGS&quot; boldly presented to the customer.

:::Do you have any idea whatsoever how that testing is done?
:::Rather than your &quot;blocks&quot;, a government inspector will come in with a few ''standard weights'' and test the scale in operation, in the very location in which it is used.  Maybe, for example, a 200 g weight and a 100 g weight, and they will see what the scale reads with one or the other or both of them, placed at varying locations on the weighing pan, see if it makes any difference if weights are being added or being taken away, things like that.
:::But what, exactly, is it that is known about those reference weights?  It isn't the amount of force that these weights exist.  They don't custom-make new weights which have a different mass, so that they can tell precisely how much force these weights exert at each particular location, and thus are useless outside that location.
:::Moreover, they wouldn't want to do that, even if they had some easy way of doing so.  We are interested in ''how much stuff we have,'' and we don't really care much about ''how hard it will press down on the table''.

:::You would, of course, also have to separate the weighing of the empty bottle, and the bottle including its contents, since we are interested in the ''net weight'' when we buy and sell goods by weight.

:::Now, let's check your understanding of history.  Let's suppose that somebody added a new word ''weyghte'' or (whatever spelling might have been used at the time, there was very little standardization in spelling then and what did exist was often slightly different from what we use now) to the English language some time over 1,000 years ago, using it to mean the quantity that they measured with one of those ''comparators'' you talked about.  So what, exactly, did this new word ''weyghte'' mean at the time, using everything we know now?

:::To put it another way, people have been weighing things for 7,00&amp;ndash;8,000 years or so, since long before the word weight entered the English language (that is, of course, the word we use today to refer to measurements made before the English word existed).  But nobody used any weighing devices that were not those mass-measuring balances, outside the past 200 years.

:::When the metric system was invented, nobody used weighing scales that were not mass-measuring balances.

:::Sir Isaac Newton never used weighing scales that were not mass-measuring balances.  Probably in part because of his day job as Master of the Mint, he liked to weigh things in troy ounces and troy grains (he often used French ''toises'' and ''pieds'' for length, however).  Of course, there is one way in which the troy units differ from their avoirdupois cousins, and differ from grams and kilograms as well&amp;mdash;there is not today and never was a troy ounce force.

:::Note that those '''comparators''', the mass-measuring type of scale we normally call a balance, were the only scales that existed at the time.  They couldn't have used anything else.  Spring scales didn't even show up in the picture until the '''Nineteenth Century''', and the various types of load cell devices are even newer than that.

:::Of course, thanks to the work of some 17th century pioneers, we are now able to distinguish between the ''mass'' of an object as that term is used in physics jargon, and the ''force that it exerts due to gravity''.  But after we humans got to be so all-fired smart three centuries ago, '''what exactly did we change about the quantity we measure when we buy and sell goods by weight?'''    '''Answer:  absolutely nothing.''' That is the most relevant point to be made here.  What exactly did we change about '''what we call this quantity?  Answer:  Nothing.'''  We still call it '''''weight''''', even if a few people are misguided enough to think that calling it '''''mass''''' instead is a sign of their intellectual superiority, and many more are even more misguided and have deluded themselves into believing that since it is in fact called ''weight'', it cannot possibly be the same thing as ''mass''.

Yes, as in an earlier reply, I acknowledge that people now, in history, in everyday life, in law, in literature and so on have and continue to use the words 'mass' and 'weight' without distinction. Since the seventeenth century, however, science has come to use these words to refer to distinct attributes. 'Mass' and 'weight' might have continued as synonyms in science - probably for weight, following the realisation that we're all living, measuring, buying, selling, writing and legislating in the same gravitational field - and a third word adopted, derived or invented to refer to amounts of matter, but this isn't what has happened. Science has come to use 'mass' to refer to amounts of matter and 'weight' to refer to the effect amounts of matter have in gravitational fields. That this has happened might not matter as regards all our everyday Earth-bound activities, but it does when thinking and writing about other celestial bodies, notions such as orbits and so on. Furthermore, drawing some attention to a distinction such as that science makes between mass and weight is a great opportunity to remind young people that new awareness can result from considering something otherwise taken as innocuous or for granted.

:Of course we use them without distinction, in contexts where no distinction can be made.

:Why do you keep repeating things like &quot;might have continued as synonyms in science&quot;?  Just what, exactly, is it that you cannot understand about '''nearly seven and a half million Google hits for &quot;molecular weight&quot;'''?  That's not even considering ''atomic weight'' and ''at. wt.'' and ''formula weight'' and the like.  Let's deal with that before we go any further, okay?

:Where did you get the idea that the '''medical sciences''' are somehow excluded from '''science'''?

:Sure, &quot;it does [matter] thinking and writing about other celestial bodies.&quot;  But just where in the world do you imagine that Lunar Module was, when '''NASA''' tells us that its '''weight''' at liftoff of its ascent stage was &quot;10,776.6 lbs&quot;?

[[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 03:57, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

I'm going to agree with David here.  There is a definite difference between weight and mass, and it needs to be made clear in a scientific book with an aim of instructing children.  Mass is the amount of matter in an object.  Weight is the force due to gravity being exerted on an object.  Grams is a unit of mass.  Newtons is a unit of force.  There is no scientific confusion in those terms.  

For an experiment, take a bathroom scale and climb a mountain.  You '''will weigh less''' at the top than at the bottom.  This is because a bathroom scale does not measure mass-  it measures weight.  Think of how it works-  it works by you depressing a spring due to the force of you standing on it.  Its working by measuring the force, '''not''' the mass.

So, how do we have pounds and ounces defined in terms of grams?  Such as the ketchup bottle or troy ounce you mentioned?  Simple-  weights are always reported in terms of weight at sea level.  When you assume a certain distance from a center of known mass, you can convert from mass to a weight by multiplying by g at that distance, then multiplying by the conversion factor.

Also, despite however many google hits you found, the correct term is not &quot;atomic weight&quot;.  It is &quot;atomic mass&quot;.  The reason for the term confusion is the same as the reason in other spheres-  antiquated usage from pre-physics days when we didn't know there was a difference.  If you search for atomic mass, you will find almost 15 millio google hits-  almost 3 times atomic weight.

I'm sorry Metric100, but your argument is wrong.  (By the way, does the name strike anyone else with irony)?  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 02:28, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, you are right.  Grams are units of mass, newtons are units of force.  When &quot;weight&quot; is measured in grams, it is a measurement of mass.  On those rare occcasions when &quot;weight&quot; is measured in newtons, it is a measurement of force.  That's what this module has tried to make clear. (Of course, there are also grams-force, units that have been deprecated since the International System of Units was introduced in 1960.  We still see far too many vestiges of their use, but almost never for anything that is called &quot;weight&quot;.  Rather, they are still used for things such as the thrust of jet and rocket engines, for tension of bicycle spokes, for pressure gauges in kg/cm², and things like that.)

:You have a totally confused notion of the definition of pounds and ounces.  Some sources have been cited above; I'll cite some more just after this reply.  Just look at that official definition in United States law, for example, the Federal Register Notice of July 1, 1959.  Show me where it says anything about gravity, or kilograms-force, or anything along those lines.  There's absolutely nothing like that in the definition.

:We often use spring scales in our bathrooms, because they are '''cheap''' and they do a reasonable job of recording differences over time, as long as we always use the same one.  But if you want to know what we are measuring, you need to look at what we measure when we get serious about our weight, and go to the doctor's office or the gym.

:Of course, your claim that pounds and ounces are defined &quot;in terms of weight at sea level&quot; is patently absurd.  What, exactly, is this &quot;weight at sea level&quot; in your estimation?  Note that the normal acceleration of gravity at the poles is 32.25780 ft/s², but normal gravity at the equator is only 32.08766 ft/s² (and local anomalies will make the total difference at sea level slightly more than that).  So, what would you say the &quot;weight&quot; is of that 12.5064 g gold bar, in the Wikipedia image linked to above?  How many pounds would that be, at sea level at the North Pole?  How many pounds would that be, at sea level at the equator?

:All those &quot;molecular weight&quot; hits are &quot;antiquated usage from pre-physics days&quot;?  Get real.  You can start by explaining why 25,800 of those hits were at the Harvard University site, and 773 of them at the site of the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), the keepers of our standards in the United States.


:You get more hits for &quot;atomic mass&quot; for two simple reasons. First, you didn't do an exact phrase search. To do that you need to put quotation marks around them, or use the advanced search input.  Doing that, I get 561,000 for &quot;atomic weight&quot; and 654,000 for &quot;atomic mass&quot;.  Second, there is a unit of mass called the &quot;atomic mass unit&quot;, or the modern preferred name &quot;unified atomic mass unit&quot; with the symbol &quot;u&quot; rahter than the obsolete &quot;amu&quot;.  Searching for site that include &quot;atomic mass&quot; but do not include &quot;atomic mass unit&quot; or &quot;atomic mass units&quot;, I get only 512,000 hits.  The same point can be made by looking at molecular weight, because we don't have a &quot;molecular weight unit&quot;.  Searching for the exact phrase &quot;molecular weight&quot; today, I get 8,400,000 hits, but searching for &quot;molecular mass&quot; I get only 1,780,000 hits.  

No irony at all; I'm smart enough to know what a pound is, and how it differs from a [[w:pound-force]], and what a [[w:kilogram-force]] is as well, and the difference between an ounce of platinum and an ounce of palladium, the difference between a Canadian ounce of Coca-Cola and a U.S. ounce of Coca-Cola, and the difference between a U.S. ounce of evaporated milk and a U.S. ounce of sweetened condensed milk, and the difference between a U.S. pint of blueberries and a U.S. pint of blueberry ice cream.  Can you come up with any better reasons to strongly prefer the modern post-1960 metric system.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 14:13, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

== Use of Kilograms as a unit of &quot;weight&quot; ==

In this instance, I think it is very misleading to use the term &quot;kilogram&quot; for weight measurements.  Where we are at an impasse over is trying to find a way to describe the effects of gravity upon us when we are in a substantially different gravitational field, like standing on the Moon or Mars.

The most appropriate SI unit for describing the difference is the newton (OK, you've won that point Metric1000), because clearly a 100 kg person standing on a spring scale on the Earth will push down with 1000 newtons, while on the Moon it would only be 170 newtons.  The problem here is that your ''mass'' would still be 100 kg, and to this point Metric1000 is technically correct, but misses the point that the effect of gravity would be quite a bit different.

It is also correct that even space medicine discussions still use the term &quot;weight&quot; for astronauts while in orbit, even though they are in a micro-g environment (the ISS does have its own gravitational field, BTW, affecting some experiments done there).  The truth is, however, those discussions are done to relate to Earth-bound measurements and to keep consistant health concepts, not to describe the effects of a change of gravitational field.

The whole point of this section is to try and convey the fact that there are differences between the properties of mass, which doesn't change from one gravitational field to another, and to describe the effect of applying force while in that environment which does change.  You can still be crushed to death by a 1000 kg object traveling at 40 km/hr if you are between that object and a wall on the Moon.  Gravity will not make one bit of difference.  On the other hand, playing a game of soccer (to choose a more international sport) is going to be played quite a bit different on the Moon than on the Earth.  Hitting a golf ball on the Moon (it happened during the Apollo XV mission) is going to have that ball travel much further than on the Earth for several reasons, even with problems of trying to hit the ball while in a spacesuit.

Where this section needs to be rewritten is to come to a compromise between ignoring the fact that mass is the same everywhere and that gravitational fields do change.  Rather than trying to suggest that if you &quot;weigh&quot; 100 kg (using this as an example here) on the Earth you would &quot;weigh&quot; 17 kg on the Moon, it would be better to describe that if you can jump up 40 cm here on the Earth that you would be able to jump up much higher on the Moon.  Or if you can &quot;lift&quot; 100 kg on the Earth that you would be able to &quot;lift&quot; 600 kg on the Moon.

In short, rather than trying to digress into &quot;weight&quot; vs. &quot;mass&quot;, lets describe the effects of the change of gravity.  What is the same, and what is different?  If you were in a Jovian gravitational field, how different would things be with gravity going the other way?  Would your bones break just trying to jump at all?  How about on Phobos, where you could accidentally jump &quot;off&quot; the moon entirely if you jumped up too long, and that even a gentle pushup might take a couple of hours to come back to the ground after going more than 1 km high from that gentle push.

We can do a better job than the typical science textbook on this subject, and for that I do appreciate what Metric1000 is trying to accomplish by raising that bar.  On the other hand, we need to also acknowledge that there are distinctively different effects for many human activities when the gravitational environment is changed.  How do we describe that very different environment?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:07, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

:It is much more misleading to bury your head in the sand and pretend that kilograms and pounds (units of mass) are not used to measure &quot;weight&quot;.
:We have ample evidence on this talk page showing that many of the editors here do not understand what that means.  Let's not raise another generation of kids with the same misconceptions.
:It is absolutely essential that we explain that the ''weight'' these students are most familiar with—''weight'' as we use it for buying and selling goods by weight, and for measuring human ''body weight'' for the purposes of health and fitness (the reasons we normally weigh ourselves)—is the same thing that some scientists like to call ''mass''.
:Otherwise, you are pretty much saying what I've been saying all along.  I guess I'll have to put together a list of all the silly statements that were originally placed in these modules, before I fixed them up a little bit. Claims that kilograms would change, etc. 
:For that golf ball, you'll get essentially the same speed off the club as you would swinging in a spacesuit on Earth; it just takes gravity longer to pull it back to the surface.  Of course, remember that in jumping, it is the change in the height of the center of gravity that matters most, and high jumpers and pole vaulters do not clear the bar in an upright position.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 13:37, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

::There are other effect that can be taken into consideration with the golf ball as well... Lack of atmospheric drag, and an increased curvature of the surface will also have a significant impact (the golf ball is on a sub-orbital ballistic trajectory, after all).  Still, I'm going to ignore those extra factors for this article.&lt;p&gt;I'm going to introduce a new &quot;section&quot; into this article going over precisely the concepts I've discussed, to explain what is different and what is the same in different gravitational fields.

::: The &quot;formula&quot; that I used to determine height was trying to approximate how high a typical kid can jump up, and then go backward to try and find what the &quot;takeoff velocity&quot; was to reach that height.  Going backward, I found the time it took to get that high and doubled it to determine how long the kid is in the air.  Using basic equations of the laws of motion and assuming a consistant &quot;take off&quot; velocity I got the amount of time you would spend before accelleration due to gravity would bring that velocity to zero.  Plugging that time into the time-distance motion formula (1/2at^2+vt+s) in turn gave me the height a kid would reach if they were jumping up.&lt;p&gt;On the whole, I think this is a better way to approach the subject.  And these are things that kids can relate to as well...perhaps better than &quot;how much I weigh on X&quot;.  I'd like to do some calculations on a kid kicking a ball, but I need to determine the vertical component to do the calculations.  Any thoughts? --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:19, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

::::The curvature is totally irrelevant on the scale of a golf ball's travel.
::::Other factors come into play in lifting things, too, of course.  For example, whenever you lift something, you are also lifting at least part of your own body at the same time.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 12:23, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::While I would agree you are also &quot;lifting&quot; your arm, but as I pointed out that only on the Earth itself is this a significant factor anyway.  I'm just trying to present some &quot;hard numbers&quot; that kids can compare their experiences to that do show a difference in gravity has different experiences.  I would also like to try and find some experiences that would demonstrate where pushing mass is the same regardless of what planet or moon you happened to be standing on.  Getting hit by a bullet from a gun and getting crushed by a car against a wall seem a little too gruesome for a kids book, even though it is an accurate depiction.  I would be very careful about pushing large mass objects around on Phobos, because kenetic energy of an object will be identical everywhere.  You just don't have the large acceleration due to gravity like you find on the Earth.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:58, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, there are still three pounds in use as units of mass, and one and only one pound-force.  Pounds-force are uniquely identified by that name.  They are such a recent spinoff that of all the hundreds of different pounds used at various times and places throughout history, only one of them has spawned a unit of force of the same name that has seen anysignificant use.

:When the U.S. first defined the pound as 0.4535924277 kg exactly, slugs did not exist.

:::Get real.  My ketchup bottle, and that of the American kids this is apparently aimed at now, says it has a &quot;net weight&quot; of &quot;24 oz (1 lb 8 oz) 680 g&quot;.  Both English and metric units, that's standard.  That's &quot;weight&quot;, whether it is pounds or pounds and ounces or grams.  Those are units of mass, not units of force, whether they are pounds or ounces or grams.  No manufacturer ever makes two different measurements to put on the label, and no manufacturer ever varies the relationship between those two numbers based on the local gravity at the place where this product will be sold (and variations on Earth certainly are great enough to that it would vary at the gram level if these were grams force).

:::Even in the United States, many hospitals measure the &quot;weight&quot; of their patients in kilograms, and those are the proper units for this used throughout the world.

::::Mass ignorance is not correctness, no matter how many ketchup bottles the equivalency is listed on. On earth, gravity is ''basically'' a constant, with a value that can be reasonably rounded off and used in general. When your ketchup bottle shows that the product weighs a certain amount (be it in pounds or ounces), the eqivalent mass in SI can be calculated out in grams. Too few people are familiar with Newtons to make a direct weight -&gt; weight conversion. The fact that gravity is nearly equivalent in all places where a person could make a perminent residence in which to store and consume their ketchup, does not change the fact that the conversion formula is pretty standardized. Also, keep in mind that the people marketing the ketchup are rarely scientists or engineers, but are instead artists and business majors who may not all be well-versed in the specifics of unit conversions. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:15, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::The defining was instead done by the experts in the field, the professional metrologists of the national standards laboratories of six of the major industrial nations of the world. 

:::::Of course it also is not a matter of &quot;Too few people are familiar with Newtons to make a direct weight -&gt; weight conversion.&quot;  That is quite ludicrous on two grounds.  First of all, there is no place in the whole world where newtons are legal units for the sale of goods.  Second, there is no place in the world where the sale of goods in pounds-force is legal; you are not starting out with pounds-force in the first place.

However, the English units are like old software, no longer supported and updated.  Nobody cares enough so that we would ever be told to stop using pounds-force, without being told to stop using pounds of any sort whatsoever. 

::::::If you are really curious about units of measure, there is another system of units reinvented several times by those insistent upon showing that those using metric units can be every bit as silly as those using English units.  Try to see what you can find out about a unit of mass known by various names in different incarnations of this system:  the hyl, the TME (from a German acronym), the mug, or the term from which the latter was shortened, &quot;metric slug&quot;.  Can you figure out what the base unit of force is in this system?

::::::Just as the existence of the hyl does not and cannot prove that kilograms are not units of mass, the existence of the slug does not and cannot prove that pounds are not units of mass. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 21:15, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

::::::Since you find the [[w:Society of Automotive Engineers]] credible, here is some more from SAE TSB003, Rules for SAE use of SI (Metric) Units, May 1999: [http://www.sae.org/standardsdev/tsb/tsb003.pdf pdf file]

::::::*3.11 '''Units for Mass, Weight, and Force—''' Mass units, such as kilogram, pound, and ounce, have often been used for units of both mass and force. This has led to serious confusion. In SI this confusion is eliminated because the unit of mass is the kilogram, and the unit of force is the newton. The kilogram-force (from which the suffix &quot;force&quot; in practice has often been erroneously dropped) is not used. Derived units that include force are formed using the newton.
::::::See, even the SAE correctly characterizes them as &quot;mass units&quot;, also &quot;used for&quot; force. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 21:27, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

Yes, I forgot about [[:w:Troy pound]]s and [[:w:British pound]]s in my previous comment. I believed that those were not relevant to the module. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:41, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:I was referring to troy pounds (which, unlike their avoirdupois cousins, and unlike grams and kilograms as well, are never units of force, and metric pounds still in informal use in much of the world, stemming from 19th century redefinitions of various local pounds.  They are 500 g exactly, and naturally those are units of mass as well.  Note also that from the time of Henry VII until at least after 1850, there were no independent primary standards for an avoirdupois pound.  Rather, they were defined as an exact fraction of a different unit of mass, just as they are today, only in that case the other unit of mass was the troy pound and today it is the kilogram.  THere were then, and are now, various secondary standards representing the avoirdupois pound, of course.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 20:55, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
[[w:Natsume Soseki|Natsume Soseki]] (夏目漱石) is one of Japan's most important authors. This is a short work by him.

== イズムの功過 ==
'''夏目漱石'''

大抵(たいてい)のイズムとか主義とかいうものは無数の事実を几帳面（きちょうめん）な男が束（たば）にして頭の抽出（ひきだし）へ入れやすいように拵（こしら）えてくれたものである。一纏（ひとまと）めにきちりと片付いている代りには、出すのが臆劫（おっくう）になったり、解（ほど）くのに手数がかかったりするので、いざという場合には間に合わない事が多い。大抵のイズムはこの点において、実生活上の行為を直接に支配するために作られたる指南車（しなんしゃ）というよりは、吾人（ごじん）の知識欲を充たすための統一函である。文章ではなくって字引である。

 [[wikt:イズム|イズム]] = &quot;ism&quot; (e.g., communism, socialism, realism)
 [[wikt:功過|功過]] (こうか) = merits and demerits; good and bad points
 [[wikt:主義|主義]] (しゅぎ) = doctrine or principle; rule
 [[wikt:無数|無数]] (むすう) = uncountable number, countless; infinite
 [[wikt:拵える|拵える]] (こしらえる) = to make; to manufacture
 [[wikt:一纏|一纏め]] (ひとまとめ) = bundle; pack; bunch


同時に多くのイズムは、零砕（れいさい）の類例が、比較的緻密（ちみつ）な頭脳に濾過（ろか）されて凝結（ぎょうけつ）した時に取る一種の形である。形といわんよりはむしろ輪廓（りんかく）である。中味（なかみ）のないものである。中味を棄てて輪廓だけを畳（たた）み込むのは、天保銭（てんぽうせん）を脊負う代りに紙幣を懐（ふところ）にすると同じく小さな人間として軽便（けいべん）だからである。

この意味においてイズムは会社の決算報告に比較すべきものである。更に生徒の学年成績に匹敵（ひってき）すべきものである。僅（わずか）一行の数字の裏面（りめん）に、僅か二位の得点の背景に殆どありのままには繰返しがたき、多くの時と事と人間と、その人間の努力と悲喜と成敗（せいはい）とが潜（ひそ）んでいる。

従ってイズムは既に経過せる事実を土台として成立するものである。過去を総束（そうそく）するものである。経験の歴史を簡略にするものである。与えられたる事実の輪廓である。型である。この型を以て未来に臨（のぞ）むのは、天の展開する未来の内容を、人の頭で拵（こしら）えた器（うつわ）に盛終（もりおお）せようと、あらかじめ待ち設（もう）けると一般である。器械的な自然界の現象のうち、尤（もっと）も単調な重複（ちょうふく）を厭（いと）わざるものには、すぐこの型を応用して実生活の便宜を計る事が出来るかも知れない。科学者の研究が未来に反射するというのはこのためである。しかし人間精神上の生活において、吾人がもし一イズムに支配されんとするとき、吾人は直（ただち）に与えられたる輪廓のために生存するの苦痛を感ずるものである。単に与えられたる輪廓の方便として生存するのは、形骸（けいがい）のために器械の用をなすと一般だからである。その時わが精神の発展が自個天然の法則に遵（したが）って、自己に真実なる輪廓を、自（みずか）らと自らに付与し得ざる屈辱を憤（いきどお）る事さえある。

精神がこの屈辱を感ずるとき、吾人はこれを過去の輪廓がまさに崩れんとする前兆と見る。未来に引き延ばしがたきものを引き延ばして無理にあるいは盲目的に利用せんとしたる罪過（ざいか）と見る。

過去はこれらのイズムに因って支配せられたるが故に、これからもまたこのイズムに支配せられざるべからずと臆断（おくだん）して、一短期の過程より得たる輪廓を胸に蔵して、凡（すべ）てを断ぜんとするものは、升（ます）を抱いて高さを計り、かねて長さを量（はか）らんとするが如き暴挙である。

自然主義なるものが起（おこ）って既に五、六年になる。これを口にする人は皆それぞれの根拠あっての事と思う。わが知る限りにおいては、またわが了解し得たる限りにおいては（了解し得ざる論議は暫（しばら）く措（お）いて）必ずしも非難すべき点ばかりはない。けれども自然主義もまた一つのイズムである。人生上芸術上、ともに一種の因果によって、西洋に発展した歴史の断面を、輪廓にして舶載（はくさい）した品物である。吾人がこの輪廓の中味を充※(「仞」のにんべんに代えて牛へん、第4水準2-80-18)（じゅうじん）するために生きているのでない事は明（あきら）かである。吾人の活力発展の内容が、自然にこの輪廓を描いた時、始めて自然主義に意義が生ずるのである。

一般の世間は自然主義を嫌っている。自然主義者はこれを永久の真理の如くにいいなして吾人生活の全面に渉（わた）って強（し）いんとしつつある。自然主義者にして今少し手強（てごわ）く、また今少し根気よく猛進したなら、自（おのずか）ら覆（くつがえ）るの未来を早めつつある事に気がつくだろう。人生の全局面を蔽（おお）う大輪廓を描いて、未来をその中に追い込もうとするよりも、茫漠（ぼうばく）たる輪廓中の一小片を堅固に把持（はじ）して、其処
（そこ）に自然主義の恒久（こうきゅう）を認識してもらう方が彼らのために得策（とくさく）ではなかろうかと思う。

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is an alternate version of the [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] module which:

# Tries to stay simple and succinct (although I realise there's room for improvement, e.g. shorter sentence lengths, fewer subclauses, etc);
# Does not refer to mass (uses &quot;bulk&quot; or &quot;bulky&quot; instead);
# Does not refer to force (uses &quot;pull&quot; instead);
# Does not refer to units;
# Does not &lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt; that weight changes, but rather that (underline emphases added):
:: &quot;You may've read or heard people &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y that your weight would be different on the Moon...&quot;;
:: &quot;[the bathroom scale] would &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y you weighed less than when you weighed yourself with it on the Earth. So people &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y your weight has changed...&quot;
:: &quot;it's &lt;u&gt;as if&lt;/u&gt; ... you have no weight...&quot;

If people think this approach is a starter then I think a couple of illustrations or diagrams and perhaps a table of what a bathroom scale would say you weighed on other planets would add interest to the page.

:IMHO (this is a talk page after all, I'm not adding content here), the whole premise that we should avoid units, nor discuss differences between mass and weight is simply a school of thought on this topic, and just one of several approaches.  The whole point to this discussion is to describe the effects of a variation of gravity from one place to another.  The problem with the previous [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight]] is that it violated NPOV standards with no attempt to have a compromise or come to a true neutral point of view on the topic.

:This module is a fork of content, and as such will eventually have to be reconsiled and/or merged with the other module.  It is fine to try and write another module that gives an alternative point of view seeking compromise and still being technically accurate.  Perhaps that is exactly what we need to do:  Write several different modules and then try to &quot;vote&quot; on which one is best for inclusion into Wikijunior Solar System.  Thanks for trying to be a solution to the problem rather than a cause.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:53, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

== good job on this ==

This is a pretty good start, although i warn that some of the current explanations can be a little bit technical and convoluted (remember, the target audience is children, not feuding, well-educated wikibookians). Although, maybe kids can understand this stuff, i can't remember how smart i was when i was a kid. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:13, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks for your encouragement, Whiteknight. I reread the text earlier and agree it could and probably should be further simplified (e.g. shorter sentences, such as for &quot;The Moon, for example, is less bulky than the Earth, so if you weighed yourself there...&quot;). I'd hope, however, that given further simplification, a couple of illustrations and maybe a table, it's nearer an end rather than a start &amp;mdash; if, that is, more people think it's worth using. Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 22:50, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

== Well written -- maybe too much for this book ==

This is a well-written module.
I think it is too much for a book that is supposed to be only 48 pages in total, and which already contains a section on gravity, mass, and weight ([[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System#About gravity, mass, and weight]]).

The book is overloaded.  It will soon be large enough to be a textbook for a year-long course in the solar system for elementery students.

Though this section is mostly well-written, I would be happy to remove it entirely.  Perhaps it could find a new home in another book.  A physics book for children.  &quot;Force and Motion -- how things move&quot;.

--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 12:07, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks for your comments, SV Resolution. I agree that its all too easy for Wikijunior books to become overgrown, but this module [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|About weight and gravity]] is offered as a ''replacement'' for [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] (or, at least, most of a replacement). I feel a decision needs to be reached as to whether one or other of these modules is included, or none like them at all. I think there's a case for including such a module, as I've already come across areas in the book where it might usefully be referenced, e.g. the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Comets|Comets]] module which I have been (but have currently suspended) copyediting. Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 12:26, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

I think either [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|About weight and gravity]] or [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] would be too much for this book.  Before either of these two sections were begun, there was already a subsection of [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System]] called [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System#About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] (sorry for the earlier, confusing typo)  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 16:11, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

: Ah, I see what you mean. I also see the page needs a little formatting attention (e.g. dashes) so I intend to review it. Are there any Wikijunior contributors able to test the Solar System content on some young people, to see what might be missing, boring, over-pitched, etc? &amp;nbsp;I think this is very important. Unfortunately I am not readily able to do so.

: Thanks again for your interest, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 21:50, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

:: I have had trouble with some of the obtuse language in both this module [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity]] and [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight]]. The latter module (gravity, mass, and weight) contained wording about inertia which I removed (though you can still see in the source - &quot;edit this page&quot;).

:: This module (weight and gravity) was an alternate approach without mentioning mass. But it does mention mass; it uses the word ''bulky'' instead of the word ''mass''.

:: As it is, I have little familiarity with Wikijunior, and I prefer not to claim that these modules are &quot;well-writen&quot;. I was wondering if the best solution was to move both modules out of Wikijunior. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:43, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for your input, Kernigh. The consensus, although small, seems to be to include neither module. I'll therefore let some time pass and then, if they're still there, remove mention of the [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] and [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About weight and gravity]] from the [[Wikijunior Solar System#Main modules|Main modules]] and [[Wikijunior Solar System#Other modules|Other modules]] lists. Apologies for not making clear that it was the ''word'' &quot;mass&quot; I was aiming not to use, for the sake of younger readers. Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 14:17, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

:I think this module has merit.  I don't think it should be moved out of Wikijunior.  Just out of Wikijunior Solar System. &quot;How Things Move&quot; -- dyamics for children.--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 01:56, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
== Nineteenth century ==

* 1837 - Charles Babbage designs the first programmable computer called the &quot;Analytical Engine&quot;.  This was designed to use punch cards of the type used in Jacquard looms. Ada Lovelace wrote a program for the machine. The Analytical Engine is probably the first &quot;Turing Complete&quot; computer design.
* 1847-1854 George Boole develops Boolean algebra which is the foundation of the hardware design of all modern digital computers.
* Mid-late nineteenth century mechanical and electromechanical adding machines developed and widely used.

== The 20's ==

* 1920's - German Enigma Machine, an electromechanical rotor machine is widely used to encrypt and decrypt secret messages. Although this was not a computer, being more like an advanced adding machine, its role in World War II stimulated computer design for decryption machines.

*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1972&lt;/span&gt; Alan Kay&lt;ref&gt;Alan Kay - Leader of the team that created the first personal computers.&lt;/ref&gt; joins PARC where he will develop Smalltalk for the Dynabook project which aims to create a useful user-programmable laptop computer ... for kids. Despite early successes with children, Alan Kay will decide that this is a more or less impossible goal and fall back on reimplementing Smalltalk.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1972&lt;/span&gt; C programming language created by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson.

*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1973&lt;/span&gt; Unix rewritten in C, becoming the first operating system written in a language other than Assembly, which action decisively wins for Unix the OS wars despite its many shortcomings.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1973&lt;/span&gt; Gary Kildall writes the CP/M operating system.
*&lt;span class=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;1973&lt;/span&gt; Chuck Thacker creates the Alto (networked personal computer with GUI) at PARC.

*&lt;span class=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;1975&lt;/span&gt; Ed Roberts creates the MITS Altair 8800 kit, considered to be the first microcomputer. It was featured in the January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1975&lt;/span&gt; - William Henry Gates III, a student at Harvard University, partners with fellow student Paul Allen to found Microsoft in order to market a version of the BASIC language, originally developed by Gates and Allen for the MITS Altair 8800 microcomputer.
*&lt;span class=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;1975&lt;/span&gt; September - MOS Technology unveils the 6502 microprocessor at the Wescon show. This $25 processor becomes the heart of Apple and Commodore computers.

*&lt;span class=&quot;none&quot;&gt;1978&lt;/span&gt; November - Third West Coast Computer Fair which later becomes COMDEX.

*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1979&lt;/span&gt; Steve Jobs visits Xerox PARC in exchange for allowing Xerox to invest $1 million in Apple. He's shown the first ever computer network, the first ever graphical interface and object-oriented programming. Xerox will soon disinvest from Apple, before its success.
*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;1979&lt;/span&gt; Ted Nelson convenes The Xanadu Group to work on a storage system for his visionary sophisticated hypertext system called Xanadu.
*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;1979&lt;/span&gt; May - [[w:Seattle Computer Products|Seattle Computer Products (SCP)]] a Seattle, Washington microcomputer hardware company thanks to Tim Patterson had a working prototype for Intel's 8086 by May 1979. Tim Patterson, hired in June 1978 by SCP's owner Rod Brock, was successful in redirecting the company's focus, a process that began after his attendance at a local seminar on Intel's just-released 8086 in late summer 1978.
*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;1979&lt;/span&gt; November - Seattle Computer Products (SCP) begins shipping its first S-100 bus 8086 CPU boards to customers including Microsoft BASIC as an option, but no operating system was available. It will soon be one of the first manufacturers of computer systems based on the 16-bit Intel 8086 processor and a crucial player in the history of the industry, even a cautionary tale. 

== The 80's ==
{{TODO|Cleanup, add Microsoft formation and Microsfot BASIC, Missing IBM and Itel path.}}
*In the United Kingdom of the early 1980s, the pioneer of computing technology was Cambridge-educated Sir Clive Sinclair. Sinclair had made his money on innovative electronic products such as calculators and radios. In fact Sir Clive is credited with the invention of the world's first pocket television. In 1980 Sinclair released the sub-£100 ZX80. This paved the way for the ZX81 and the biggie, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum in 1982. The Spectrum became Britain's fastest-selling computer, despite its relative paucity of features compared to rival computers such as the Commodore 64 and the Amstrad 464.
*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;1980&lt;/span&gt; - Usenet is created as a &quot;poor man's ARPANET&quot;.

*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1980&lt;/span&gt; April - Seattle Computer Products (SCP) start development of QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System). Tim Patterson the author was charged to develop a new OS for 16-Bit machines based on CP/M after SCP business stalled due to the delay of [[w:CP/M-86|CP/M-86]] OS that was expected by the end of 1979. Developed over a four-month period. QDOS 0.11 was finished in August 1980. SCP is oblivious to the fact that Microsoft has represented the OS to IBM as their own product.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1980&lt;/span&gt; September - Seattle Computer Products (SCP) began shipping QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System).
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1980&lt;/span&gt; December - Microsoft buys QDOS after selling it to IBM for a massive profit. The original O/S CPM/86 by Digital is not ready for release and IBM needs something to bridge the gap. Bill Gates negotiates an unusual contract which lets Microsoft retain the right to independently market QDOS, which it proceeds to do as MS-DOS. This one borrowed piece of software launches Microsoft's meteoric rise to success. 
*&lt;span class=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;1981&lt;/span&gt; August - The IBM PC is introduced. 8-bit computing is widespread on the desktop, but the 16-bit IBM machine is about to change that.
*&lt;span class=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;1981&lt;/span&gt; November - Commodore's MOS Technology finishes the VIC-II video processor chip. Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel orders a 64K computer using this chip.

*&lt;span class=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;1988&lt;/span&gt; The Giant Magneto-Resistive effect is discovered, which will soon enable a second speedup in the rate of increase of hard drive capacities. The MR and GMR together turn storage from the slowest growing of the (storage, computation, networking) triad into the fastest, upsetting the economics of computation forevermore.
*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;1989&lt;/span&gt; [[w:Tim_Berners-Lee|Tim Berners-Lee]] creates HTML.

*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;2005&lt;/span&gt; Dual core processors permit Moore's Law to continue by reducing microprocessor heating. Clock speeds level off at 4000 MHz and chip resolution heads for 65 nm. Motherboards with up to 16 64-bit processors are available. Multiple-gigabyte memories for desktop computers are available. 200 gB hard drives are common.

== The 10's ==
{{NOTE|The time line ends here since it is improbable to determine how any new technology will impact or be relevant on the long run. For instance in 2010 April, Apple releases the iPad will still be hard to claim that it was an innovation in itself and with a long lasting impact or for instance claiming that 2010 was the year that Dual-Core processing and 64-bit Operating systems become standard is also a stretch.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting Started ==

=== Things you need ===

*[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=262D25E3-F589-4842-8157-034D1E7CF3A3&amp;displaylang=en .Net Framework 1.1]
*[http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/ Visual Studio .Net]
*[http://desktop.google.com/developer.html Google Desktop SDK]

=== How to get started ===

You need to create a COM object

=== What is a COM object and why do I need to create it? ===

GD uses COM objects as plugins. Actually these are like ActiveX components. They are meant to be reusable.

=== How to create a COM object ===

In Visual Studio, create a C# Class Library. 

=== Preliminary code for the Class Library project ===

You should implement two (2) methods: 

 static void ComRegisterFunctionAttribute(Type t) {
 ''include initialization code here''
 }

This function is called whenever you register your COM object to the system. You can put initialization code here, like code that will register our plugin to GD (Details later). 

 static void ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute(Type t) {
 }

This function is called whenever you unregister your COM object. 

You should have the following statement:

 using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

=== What kind of files are created when I compile my Class Library project? ===

After building your Class Library project, Visual Studio will generate the following file types in your output folder: .dll and .tlb

The .dll file generated is actually a COM object that we need to register to the system.

=== How to load/register a COM object ===

 Use: regasm [dllfile] /tlb

Regasm.exe is located in your .Net Framework bin folder.

=== What method/code is first executed after I load a COM object? ===

The system makes a call to ComRegisterFunctionAttribute so it is necessary that you implement this method. It is here where we put our initialization, like a block of code that will register our plugin to GD.

=== Registering the plugin to GD ===

 try {
 GoogleDesktopRegistrarClass registrar = new GoogleDesktopRegistrarClass();
 // Start component registration by specifying our attributes
 object[] descriptions = {
 &quot;Title&quot;, pluginName,
 &quot;Description&quot;, pluginName,
 &quot;Icon&quot;, &quot;&quot;
 };
 
 registrar.StartComponentRegistration(controlGuid, descriptions);
 
 IGoogleDesktopRegisterDisplayPlugin displayRegistration = 
 (IGoogleDesktopRegisterDisplayPlugin)
 
 registrar.GetRegistrationInterface(&quot;GoogleDesktop.DisplayPluginRegistration&quot;);
 
 displayRegistration.RegisterPlugin(controlGuid, false);
 // Done with component registration.
 registrar.FinishComponentRegistration();
 }
 catch (Exception e) {
 MessageBox.Show(&quot;Exception thrown during registration. Description=&quot; + e.Message);
 }

=== What happens when my plugin is registered in GD? ===

Your plugin will appear in the add/remove panel list in Google Desktop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mental Math - A Guide to Effective Mental Calculations ==
''Note about Notation: This book generally uses the English/U.S. styles of notation. This includes using commas as a way to divide up the thousands in long numbers (e.g. 32,000 = thirty-two thousand), it will use full stops (periods) as decimal points.''
Calculating things in your head can be a difficult task. If you can't remember what you've worked out or simply don't know how to solve a problem then it can be very challenging and frustrating. But by learning and practicing the methods of using mathematical patterns, you can dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of your arithmetic.  These methods are often called &quot;High Speed Mental Math&quot;.
Mental Math is a valuable skill to have, even in the computerized world we live in:
# With good mental math skills you can save yourself time by not needing to pull out a calculator (or cell phone) every time you want to do a task.
# Mental math skills will improve your ability to estimate results, thus having a better ability to catch errors from computer-derived results.  For example, while a calculator will generally give the right answer, based upon what was typed in, if you accidentally typed the wrong number, you might not catch your error if you didn't have good mental arithmetic skills.

== Addition ==
The foundation of all arithmetic is addition, also known as summing. Similar to all mental math calculations, you can improve your ability to add numbers by learning to use some basic patterns.
=== Changing the Order of Addition ===
Often when looking for a pattern to help you quickly do an addition problem, it can help to change the order that you add things.  For example, 8+1 is the same as 1+8, and in both cases you just count up one from 8, to get the answer 9.   If you get stumped on an addition problem, try changing the order of which one you add first, and see if it helps.
=== Adding Zero, One, or Two ===
Unless you are completely new to addition, you surely know the pattern for adding I zero.  Anything plus zero is equal to the original number.  Thus when you see a zero in an addition problem, you can basically ignore it, as it won't have any effect upon the answer.   For those who are interested in math trivia, this property of zero not changing things when you add it, is called the &quot;identity property&quot; in arithmetic.  Also, keep in mind, that you can only ignore zero in addition, and sometimes in subtraction.  In multiplication and division, having a zero in a problem always changes things.
You probably also know the rule of adding 1, which is simply count up one number.  This can also be used quickly with 2, where you can either count up 2 numbers, or if you know your even and odd numbers well, you can skip to the next even or odd.
To understand using the even and odd pattern, you may be familiar with the cheer that has the even numbers: &quot;2,4,6,8, who do we appreciate?&quot;   If we add 6+2 we will go up to the next even number, which is 8.  Similarly, the odd numbers go 1,3,5,7 so 2+7 will be the next odd number, which is 9.
=== Adding Nine or Eight: Counting Down from 10 ===
Another arithmetic pattern you surely know, is how to add 10 to a number.  An example of this is 2+10 is 12, or 6+10 is 16.  We can use this pattern to help us add 9 or 8.  Since 9 is one less than 10, you can always add nine to something by adding 10 to the number instead and then counting down one.  For instance to find 9+7, you can add 10+7, which is 17, and then count down to 16. 
Similarly with adding 8 to a number, you can also add 10, and then count down 2 numbers.  So for instance, 8+7 can be found by adding 10+7 which is 17, and then counting down 2, which is 15.  If you are good with knowing your even and odd numbers, you can also use a similar pattern as was explained with adding 2, by just going down one even or odd number.
or you could say when its adding 9 you know its going to a higher number for instance 9+8 you know its going to be a teen so subtract one 9+8 = 1 now subtract one from 8 to get 7 now put them next to each other to get 17.
=== Doubling and Nearly Doubling ===
You may already be good at doubling numbers, such as 2+2.  When doubling a number, you are doing the same thing as multiplying by 2.  This also means, that if you have learned to count by numbers, such as counting by 4's, you know that it is 4, 8, 12, 16...  And thus 4+4 is 8.  
Once you have become good at doubling, you can use this knowledge to add numbers that are nearly double of each other, by just counting up or down by one.  So for instance, 8+7 can be found by adding 8+8, which is 16, and then counting down by 1, which is 15.  (If it is easier, you could also have done this by doing 7+7, which is 14, and then counting up 1 to 15.)
=== Adding Fives ===
This technique is a little trickier than the others we have so far talked about, but with some practice it might help you out.  When adding 5 to another number, the goal is to &quot;find the five inside&quot; the other number, and then add or subtract what is left.  For instance when adding 5+8, you could say that 8 is 5+3, so 5+8 is 5+5+3, or 13.  Don't worry if you can't get this method, because most of the time you can use one of the other methods that have been taught to find the answer.
=== To Ten or Close ===
It is useful to memorize the patterns that add to 10 which are:
* 0+10
* 1+9
* 2+8
* 3+7
* 4+6
* 5+5
By knowing these patterns, if you see a pattern a little different you will know to go one higher or lower.  For instance, 4+7 has the 7 one higher than 6, so this must add up to 11, because 4+6=10 so 4+6+1=11.
=== Summing Groups of Numbers by Finding Numbers that Add to Multiples of 10 ===
A useful trick when adding lots of small numbers is to clump together the ones that add up to multiples of 10.  For example, if you have to add 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 8, that can be rearranged as (3 + 7) + (9 + 11) + (2 + 8) + 5 = 10 + 20 + 10 + 5 = 45.
This method is also useful when performing column addition with more than two numbers. For example, in the problem:
  56
  35
  47
  21
  12
  32
 +23 
 ---
Column addition is generally performed by adding the digits in the ones place, carrying them over, and then adding the digits in the tens place., and so on. A way to make this task easier is to group the digits in the ones place in groups of ten, and mark them on your paper like this:
  5 6
  3 5
  4 &lt;s&gt;7&lt;/s&gt;\
  2 1 \
  1 2  -- 10
  3 2 /
 +2 &lt;s&gt;3&lt;/s&gt;/ 
 ---
 
Similarly the 6, 2, and 2 would be crossed off, yielding another 10. Therefore the digits in the ones place add up to 10+10+5+1 (what's left) or 26.
== Subtraction ==
A useful trick when subtracting numbers is to begin with the smaller value and mentally skip your way up the difference, with jumping points at recognizable boundaries, such as powers of 10.  For example, to subtract 67 from 213 I would start with 67, then add 3 + 30 + 100 + 13.  Try this once and you see how easy it is. Sounding out your thoughts it would be &quot;three, thirty-three, one hundred thirty-three plus the remaining 13 is one hundred forty-six&quot;. 
A second method is to break up the number that you are subtracting. So instead of doing 1000-258 you would do 1000-250 and then subtract 8.
=== Subtraction from Numbers consisting of 1 followed by zeros: 100; 1,000; 10,000; etc===
For example 1,000 - 258
We simply subtract each digit in 258 from 9 and the last digit from 10.
          2           5             8
          from 9      from 9        from 10
          7           4             2
So the answer is 1,000 - 258 = 742

Note that if the number being subtracted (the minuend) ends in a series of zeros, you subtract the last ''nonzero'' digit from 10, and leave the trailing zeros alone. E.g.: 10,000 - 5920 = {9-5}{9-9}{10-2}0 = 4080.
This always works for subtractions from numbers consisting of a 1 followed by zeroes: 100; 1000; 10,000 etc.
Another way of easily thinking of this method is to always subtract from 999 if subtracting from 1,000, and then adding 1 back. Same for 10,000, subtract from 9999 and add 1. For example, 1000-555 =    999 - 555 + 1= 444 + 1 = 445
Similarly 10,000 - 1068 = (9999-1068)+1 = (8931)+1 =8932
So the answer is 10,000 - 1068 = 8932
For 1,000 - 86, in which we have more zeros than figures in the numbers being subtracted, we simply suppose 86 is 086. 
So 1,000 - 86 becomes 1,000 - 086 = 914
=== Bigger Numbers using the 9s Trick (10's Complement Addition) ===
The above technique can be extended to arbitrarily long numbers in the following way: subtract the minuend from the next power of ten greater than the subtrahend using the nines trick above, then ''add'' the result to the subtrahend instead, but don't carry the final '1'.

Example:
 1,254,953-34,064
34,064 becomes 9,965,936 via the nines trick (notice we pad the beginning with 9's to make it the same length as the subtrahend). Now add:
 11   1 1
  1,254,953
 +9,965,936
  1,220,889
And again notice that we do not include the final carried '1' on the left in our result.

=== Subtracting Left-to-Right ===
Normal subtraction is performed right-to-left, borrowing from the left when a borrow is needed. However, we read left to right, and numbers are read out loud to us in this same order, so it is convenient to be able to subtract left-to-right as well. We can do this by going ahead and pre-borrowing by default and then adding back a carry (if there is one) when we move on to the next column if it turns out we didn't need to borrow. This technique also cuts down on the amount of mental work one must do to propagate a borrow from right to left.

Example:
  9543
 -1992
First preborrow from the 9, leaving 8 and subtract the thousands place:
   1
  8543
 -1992
  7
Now preborrow from the 15 in the hundreds place, leaving a 14, and subtract:
   11
  8443
 -1992
  75
Now preborrow from the 14 in the tens place, leaving a 13, and subtract:
   111
  8133
 -1992
  754
Last column, we have nothing to borrow from, so we just subtract. In this case, we don't get a single digit, so we carry it back to the tens place:
   111
  8133
 -1992
  7551
And we're done! 7551 is the correct answer.

Chances are you already know the pattern for multiplying by 0, 1 and 10.  But in case you don't, anything times 0 is 0.  Anything times 1, is itself still, and anything times 10 has a zero added to the end, so 29x10 is 290.
==== Patterns for 2, 4, and 8 ====
Multiplying by 2 is simply doubling a number, and so the pattern for doubling with addition is the same. 
Multiplying by 4 is doubling twice.  So 12x4, can be found by going 12+12 which is 24 and then 24+24 which is 48.
Similarly, multiplying by 8 is doubling 3 times, so 12x8 is 12+12 which is 24, then 24+24 which is 48, and then 48+48 which is 96.
==== Patterns for 3 and 6 ====
Multiplying by 3 can be done by doubling and then adding the number to itself, so 12x3 is 12+12 which is 24, and then add 12 to that which is 36. 
Multiplying by 6 is similar in that it is doubling first, and then multiplying by 3.  
==== Patterns for 9 ====
Multiplying by 9 has a special pattern.  When multiplying a single digit by 9, the answer will always start with a digit one less than the number, and then the other number will add to 9.  This may sound complex, but lets look at an example.   If we want to do 9x6, simply have your first digit being one less than 6, so we know the answer will start with a 5, then then next digit must add up to 9, so the number that when added to 5 will equal 9, is 4, so the answer of 9x6 is 54.  Another way to think of this method is you're multiplying the number by 10, then subtracting the number from the product. If you think of it this way, then this example becomes 10x6 = 60, then 60-6 = 54.
==== Patterns for 5 ====
Any number multiplied by 5 will end in either a 5 or a 0.  One way of finding the answer is to multiply by 10 first, and then divide your answer in half.  Another is to count by fives.
==== &quot;Number Neighbors&quot; ====
If you don't know the answer to a problem, you may know the answer to a problem where one of the numbers is one more or less than the one in the problem.  For instance, if you didn't know the answer to  7 x 6, you  might know 6 x 6 is 36, and then you could just add one more 6 to get to 42.
=== Multiplying Larger Numbers === 
When multiplying larger numbers it is very important to pick the correct sums to do. If you multiply 251 by 323 straight off it can be very difficult, but it is actually a very easy sum if approached in the right way. 251x3 + 251x20 + 251x300 is a scary prospect, so you have to work out the simplest method.
====Rounding====
One of the first things to do is to look if the numbers are near anything easy to work out. In this example there is, very conveniently, the number 251, which is next to 250. So all you have to do is 323x250 + 323 - much easier, but 323x250 still doesn't look too simple. There is, however, an easy way of multiplying by 250 which can also apply to other numbers. You multiply by 1000 then divide by 4. So 323x1000 = 323,000, divide by two and you get 161,500, divide by 2 again and you get 80,750. Now this may not seem easy, but once you've gotten used to it, dividing by four (or other low numbers) in that way becomes natural and takes only a fraction of a second. 80,750+323 = 81,073 , so you've got the answer with a minimum of effort compared to what you would otherwise have done. You can't always do it this easily, but it is always useful to look for the more obvious shortcuts in this style.
An even more effective way in some circumstances is to know a simple rule for a set of circumstances. There are a large number of rules which can be found, some of which are explained below.
====Factoring====
If you recognize that one or both numbers are easily divisible, this is one way to make the problem much easier. For example, 72 x 39 may seem daunting, but if taken as 8 x 9 x 3 x 13, it becomes much easier.
First, rearrange the numbers in the hardest to multiply order. In this case, I'd go with 13 x 8 x 9 x 3. Then multiply them one at a time. 
#13 x 8 = 10 x 8 + 3 x 8 = 80 + 24 = 104
#104 x 9 = 936
#936 x 3 = 2808 that would equal another number 
Which would equal up to a whole new
Faction
==== Multiplication by 11 ====
To multiply any 2-digit number by 11 we just put
the total of the two digits between the 2 figures.
for example: 27x11 can be written as [2][2+7][7]
Thus, 27x11=297
Another example: 33x11 can be written as [3][3+3][3]
Thus, 33x11=363. To visualise:
  330
 + 33
 ----
  363
Carry=overs:
77 x 11 = 847 
This involves a carry figure because 7 + 7 = 14
we get 77 x 11 = [7][14][7]. We add the 1 from 14 as carry over to 7 and get 77x11=847
Similarly,
84x11 can be written as [8][8+4][4]=[8][12][4]. The 1 from 12 carries over, giving 84x11=924
For 3 digit numbers multiplied by 11:
254 x 11 = 2794 
We put the 2 and the 4 at the ends.
We add the first pair 2 + 5 = 7.
and we add the last pair: 5 + 4 = 9.
So we can write 254 x 11 as [2][2+5][5+4][4]
i.e. 254x11=2794
Similarly, 909x11 can be written as [9][9+0][0+9][9] i.e. 909x11=9999
==== Multiplication by 99, 999, 9999,  etc  ====
To multiply a number A by 99, you can multiply A by 100 and then subtract A from the result.
When the number A is a two digit or one digit number, the result would be
(A - 1) following by (100 - A).  For example, when we multiply 65 by 99, we get
6435.
Similarly, to multiply a number A by 999, you can multiply A by 1000 and then subtract A from the result.
When the number A is a three digit, two digit or one digit number, the result would be
(A - 1) following by (1000 - A).  For example, when we multiply 611 by 999, we get
610389.
This same idea can be used for multiplication by any large number consisting only 9s.
====Same First Digit, Second Digits Add to 10====
Let's say you are multiplying two numbers, just two two-digit numbers for now (though the rules could be adapted for others) which start with the same digit and the sum of their unit digits is 10. For example, 87×83 (sum of unit digits: 7+3=10). You multiply the first digit by one more than itself (8×9 = 72). Then multiply the second digits together (7×3 = 21). Then stick the first answer at the start of the second to get the answer (7221). A simple proof of how this works is given in the Wikipedia article on [[w:Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha's Vedic mathematics#By one more than the one before|Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha's Vedic mathematics]].
If the result from the multiplication of the unit digits is less than 10, simply add a zero in front of the number (i.e., 9 becomes 09). For example, 59×51 is equal to [5×6][9×1] which equals [30][09]. Thus 59×51 = 3009.
==== Squaring a Number That Ends with 5 ====
This is a special case of the previous method.  Discard the 5, and multiply the remaining number by itself plus one.  Then tack on a 25 (which as in the previous section, is 5x5).  For example, 65x65.  Discarding the 5 from 65 leaves us with 6&lt;s&gt;5&lt;/s&gt; = 6.  Multiplying 6 by itself plus one gives us 42 (6x7 = 42).  Tacking on a 25 yields 4225, so 65x65=4225.
For example, 45x45 can be written as [4x5][5x5]thus 45x45 = 2025
==== Squaring a two-digit number ====
Rather than doing 14&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 47&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as 14x14 or 47x47, the alternative is:
 14&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
 = 10 x 1(14 + 4) + (4 x 4)
 = 10(18) + 16
 = 180 + 16
 = 196
In other words, add what's in the ones place to the number, multiply it by what was originally in the tens place (sometimes you'll get a sum with the next number up in the tens i.e. 47 + 7 = 54 so use 4 not 5 in this example) tack a zero at the end, then add the square of the ones place. So:
 47&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
 = 10 &amp;times; 4(47 + 7) + (7 &amp;times; 7)
 = 10 &amp;times; 4(54) + 49
 = 10 &amp;times; 216 + 49
 = 2160 + 49 = 2209
So now we know that 47&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 2209.
When squaring two digit numbers that are only 1 away from a number ending in zero you can also use the basic algebraic formulas (A^2)-(A-1)^2 = 2A-1 and (A+1)^2 - (A^2) = 2A + 1.  For example when squaring 99 you can set 100 as A then: that's not true because they explained it the wrong way 
100^2 = 10000
2 * 100 = 200
So the answer is (10000 - 200) + 1 = 9801
To square 91 use the second formula.  Then:
90^2 = 8100
2*90 = 180
So the answer is 8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281
==== Squaring a number when you know the square of a number adjacent or in proximity ====
This is useful if you want to quickly calculate the square of a number when you know the square of the adjacent number.  For example, take the square of 46, using the &quot;5&quot; rule above you know that 45 squared is 2025.  Leverage this number and add 45+46 (91) to 2025, which equals 2116. While adding 91 to 2025 in your head isn't exactly easy, it is certainly easier than trying to calculate the square of 46 directly.  Doing this with an adjacent known square that is below is a bit more challenging depending on how you feel about doing subtraction in your head.  For subtraction, using 45 as our base, and trying to figure our what 44 squared is, we would take the known value of 2025 subtract 44 and 45 to get 1936.  This can be leveraged to try to determine squares that are not directly adjacent to the known square, but it gets a bit more complex (in your head!).  Symbolically: if b=a+1 and a and b are integers then b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+|a|+|b|.
====Just Over 100====
This trick works for two numbers that are just over 100, as long as the last two digits of both numbers multiplied together is less than 100. For example, for 103 x 124, 3 x 24 = 72 &lt; 100, so this trick will work. For 117 x 112, 17 x 12 = 204 &gt; 100, so it will not.
If the first test works, then the answer is:
:1[sum of last two digits][product of last two digits]
Examples:
*108 x 109 = 1[8+9][8x9] = 1[17][72] = 11,772
*105 x 115 = 1[5+15][5x15] = 1[20][75] = 12,075
*132 x 103 = 1[32+3][32x3] = 1[35][96] = 13,596
If the addition or multiplication of the last 2 digits &lt; 10, then add a 0 infront of the number, example if the addition is 4, it should be 04. Example shown below:
*102 x 103 = 1[2+3][2x3]=1[05][06]=10,506
This trick works for numbers just over 200, 300, 400, etc. with one simple change:
:[product of first digits][(sum of last two digits) x first digit][product of last two digits]
Examples:
*215 x 204 = [2x2][(15+4)x2][15x4] = [4][19x2][60] = [4][38][60] = 43,860
If the addition or multiplication of the last 2 digits &lt; 10, then add a 0 infront of the number, example if the addition is 4, it should be 04. Example shown below:
*201 x 202 = [2x2][(2+1)x2][2x1]=[4][06][02]= 4,0602
For numbers just over 1000, 2000, etc., use the following:
:[product of first digits]0[(sum of last two digits) x first digit]0[product of last two digits]
Examples:
*2008 x 2009 = [2x2]0[(8+9)x2]0[8x9] = [4]0[17x2]0[72] = [4]0[34]0[72] = 4,034072
***2008 x 2009 = 4,034,072
For each order of magnitude (x10), add two zeroes to the middle.
== Division ==
Again there are many possible techniques, but you can make do with the following or research your own. All numbers are the products of primes (you can make them by multiplying together prime numbers). If you are dividing you can divide by all the prime products of the number you are dividing by to get the answer. This means that 100/24 = (((100/2)/2)/2)/3. Although this means you have a lot more stages to do they are all much simpler. 100/2 = 50 , 50/2 = 25 , 25/2 = 12.5 , 12.5/3 = 4&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; = 4&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.166666666recurring
Also, another helpful trick is, when you have to muliply and then divide by a number, always divide first, until you've reached numbers that are relatively prime, and then multiply.  This keeps numbers from being too large.  For example, if you must do (18 * 115)/15, it is much easier to divide 115 by 5 and 18 by 3, and then multiply them together to get 23 * 6 = 138.
=== Multiply by the Reciprocal===
Division is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal.  For instance, division by 5 is the same as multiplication by 0.2 (1/5=0.2).  To multiply by 0.2, simply double the number and then divide by 10.
===Division by 7===
The number 1/7 is a special number, equal to &lt;math&gt;0.\overline{142857}&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that there are six digits that repeat, 142857.  A beautiful thing happens when we consider integer multiples of this number:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{7} = 0.\overline{142857}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{7} = 0.\overline{285714}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{7} = 0.\overline{428571}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{7} = 0.\overline{571428}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{7} = 0.\overline{714285}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{7} = 0.\overline{857142}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that these six fractions of seven contain the same six digits repeating in the same order ad infinitum, but starting with a different number.  But how is this useful when dividing by seven?  Consider the problem 207/7.  First, we can convert this to 200/7 + 7/7.  We know that 7/7 equals one, so the answer will be 200/7 + 1.  But what is 200/7?  It is simply 2/7 times 100, and from the above, we know that &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{7} = 0.\overline{285714}&lt;/math&gt;, so by moving the decimal point, we know that &lt;math&gt;\frac{200}{7} =28.\overline{571428}&lt;/math&gt;.  All that remains is to add the one from 7/7, giving us &lt;math&gt;\frac{207}{7} =29.\overline{571428}&lt;/math&gt;.
===Division by 9===
The fraction 1/9 and its integer multiples are fairly straightforward - they are simply equal to a decimal point followed by the one-digit the numerator repeating to infinity:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{9} = 0.\overline{11}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{9} = 0.\overline{22}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{9} = 0.\overline{33}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{9} = 0.\overline{44}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{9} = 0.\overline{55}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{9} = 0.\overline{66}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{7}{9} = 0.\overline{77}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{8}{9} = 0.\overline{88}&lt;/math&gt;
To solve a problem such as 367/9, we reduce it to 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{367}{9} = \frac{300}{9} + \frac{60}{9} + \frac{7}{9}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{367}{9} = 33.\overline{33} + 6.\overline{66} + 0.\overline{77}&lt;/math&gt;
First add &lt;math&gt;33.\overline{33} + 6.\overline{66} = 40.0&lt;/math&gt;.  Then add &lt;math&gt;40.0 + 0.\overline{77} = 40.\overline{77}&lt;/math&gt;.
===Division by 11===
The fraction 1/11 and its integer multiples are fairly straightforward - they are simply equal to a decimal point followed by the product of nine and the the integer multiple repeating to infinity:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{11} = 0.\overline{09}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{11} = 0.\overline{18}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{11} = 0.\overline{27}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{11} = 0.\overline{36}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{11} = 0.\overline{45}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{11} = 0.\overline{54}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{7}{11} = 0.\overline{63}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{8}{11} = 0.\overline{72}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{9}{11} = 0.\overline{81}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{10}{11} = 0.\overline{90}&lt;/math&gt;
== Estimation ==
The best way to make estimation quickly in mental math is to round to one or two significant digits (that is, round it to the nearest place of the highest order(s) of magnitude), and then proceed with typical operations.  Thus, 1242 * 15645 is approximately equal to 1200 * 16000 = 19200000, which is reasonably close to the correct answer of 19431090.  In certain cases, one can even round to simply the nearest power of ten (which is useful when making estimations with much error and large numbers).
== Range Search ==
It is sometimes easier to make a calculation in the opposite direction from the one you want, and this can be used to quickly estimate the value you want.
Square root is a good example.  It is easier to square numbers than to take the square root.  So you take any number that will square to a little larger than the one you want, take another that squares to less than the one you want and use an average of the two.
The trick now is to apply a general technique ( the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method Bisection Method] ).
We create a new estimate using the average of our first two numbers.  Square this.  If it's value is higher than we want, we use it as the upper value of our range.  If it is lower than we want, we use it as the lower value of our range.
We now have a new range that must contain the square root we want.  We can apply the same process again to get a more accurate value ( this is known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration Iteration] ).
This technique is widely applied in computing, but also very handy for some mental mathematics.
== Other mental maths ==
Perhaps one of the more useful tricks to mental math is memorization.  Although it may seem an annoyance to need to memorize certain math facts, such as perfect squares and cubes (especially powers of two), prime factorizations of certain numbers, or the decimal equivalents of common fractions (such as 1/7 = .1428...).  Many are simple, such as 1/3 = .3333... and 2^5 = 32, but speed up your calculations enormously when you don't have to do the division or multiplication in your head.  For example, trying to figure out 1024/32 is much easier knowing that that is the same as 2^10/2^5, or which, subtracting exponents, gives 2^5, or 32.  Many of these are memorized simply by frequent use; so, the best way to get good is much practice.
It's a good idea to memorize 3 x 17 = 51.  We can extend this to 6 x 17 = 102.  If we round these numbers 3 x 17 is approx 50, 6 x 17 is approx 100, 9 x 17 is approx 150, and so on.  These are very helpful in estimating since 3, 6, 9, 50, 100 ... are common numbers.
== Advanced Mathematics ==
It is possible to make good estimates of quite complex formulae.  Range search is a useful technique and in addition to this you can also exploit some additional mathematical rules.
=== Binomial Expansion ===
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem Binomial Theory] means we can relatively easily expand an equation like 
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1 + x} = 1 + \textstyle \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{1}{16} x^3 - \frac{5}{128} x^4 + \dots\!&lt;/math&gt;
This is very useful if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is less than 1.  In that case the powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; get smaller and smaller, and
we can ignore them.
Even for whole numbers and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer Integers], this is useful as we can split the problem into a large and small number added and then raised to a power.  The small number's powers will become less important and we can neglect terms of the expansion than involve them to get a reasonable estimate.
So :
:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^4 \;=\; x^4 \,+\, 4 x^3y \,+\, 6 x^2 y^2 \,+\, 4 x y^3 \,+\, y^4.&lt;/math&gt;
If the value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; value is much smaller than the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we can make a good estimate, even if we don't add the &lt;math&gt;y^4,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;4 x y^3&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;6 x^2 y^2&lt;/math&gt; terms.
=== Compound Interest ===
The Binomial Theorem again comes to our help.  Here we usually want to work out :
:&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n&lt;/math&gt;
::where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of interest (e.g. rate is 5% then &lt;math&gt;x = 0.05&lt;/math&gt; ) and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the period.
Using the theory we can roughly estimate this as
:&lt;math&gt;1 + n x + \frac{n (n-1)}{2} x^2&lt;/math&gt;
Although this is only a simple approximation it works quite well for small x.

A '''bean pot''' is a medium sized earthenware vessel in which [[Cookbook:Baked Beans|baked beans]] are customarily made.
The ingredients are combined in the bean pot and left in a warm or moderate [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Bake|bake]] for several hours, often four or more.

Modern bean pots come in a variety of colors and designs, but tradition holds that a bean pot should be two-tone brown, on cream.

Bean pots also vary widely in size, though two- and three-quart (2-3 L) pots are by far the most common. A one-quart (1 L) bean pot holds enough beans to feed two people sufficiently, while large families might find pots bigger than three quarts (3 L) to be excessive.

Although cooking baked beans in a bean pot is traditional, there is no reason that [[Cookbook:Beans|beans]] cannot be baked in any [[Cookbook:Bakeware|baking dish]] with a suitable cover. A [[Cookbook:Dutch oven|Dutch oven]] is a well-suited replacement for a bean pot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Cooking Beans===

I recently added a section talking about an alternative cooking method and reasons why it may be superior to the traditional soaking method.
After writing it all, I realized that I don't have my sources handy and I felt uncomfortable about committing it, so I just commented it out and left it for another time.

My sources are several fold, though:

* Mark Bitman, in ''How to Cook Everything'', cites the overnight soak as unnecessary in terms of cooking time.
* John Thorne, in ''Pot on the Fire'', cites it as unnecessary in terms of
*# cooking time
*# flatulence (effect is negligible)
*# flavor (salting early doesn't toughen beans but makes them taste better)
* ''Cooks Illustrated'', in an article entitled '''Eliminating Gas from Beans''', did some lab analysis and found that very few of the fart inducing compounds are removed by soaking and only 20-40% are removed by repeated water changes as they cook.

Also, my own experience shows that all of that work isn't really necessary.  So, anyone have any objections to be adding this information?  I can dig my sources out of storage if it matters.
[[User:Crcarter|Crcarter]] 14:49, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

Removing 20% to 40% is pretty good I think. I wonder how long they cooked the beans though. I suggest 6 or more hours, and at least several water changes, in addition to the overnight soak. Your experience that &quot;all of that work isn't really necessary&quot; may reflect a simple lack of concern for farts or your luck in having low-gas gut bacteria. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:19, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

Well, I wouldn't say that 20-40% is ''pretty good'' so much as ''it's something'', especially as if you're talking about hours of extra work.
(I now ''must'' dig my sources out of storage to satisfy my curiosity.)
Is there policy on presenting different methods of preparing certain foods?
I would think it best to present the simplest and most straightforward method of preparation.
Other methods (eg, `Fart Reducing') could be presented as variations, especially since such methods may be prone to diminishing the flavor, texture or character of the food being prepared.

Fart apathy and above average gut-fauna diversity doesn't change the fact that I think the &quot;common knowledge&quot; that beans must be soaked (and require extensive cooking times) is unfounded.  Simple experience shows otherwise.
[[User:Crcarter|Clayton Carter]] 00:43, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

Well actually that brings to mind other benefits of long cooking times: you can get rid of the awful beany taste and make the beans easy to mash. Mashing the beans to make refried beans for a burrito is way easier after 6 hours of cooking. This isn't much work for the human. The human just needs to plan ahead. The stove does almost all the work. It's not a problem to have multiple cooking methods on this page as long as they all focus on the beans and don't turn into real recipes. If you start needing ingredient lists, make seperate pages. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:33, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

Right.  So, I'll -- at some point soon -- make a change to indicate these cooking techniques:
# Conventional: overnight soaking and simmering.
# Skip the soak, just simmer. (Mine, I guess.)
# Fart reduction: soak and extended simmer w/ water changes.

On our personal debate, though, I happen to like that &quot;awful beany taste&quot;.
Why would you eat beans if you don't like the way they taste?
I guess it's a matter of kitchen philosophy, but I generally try to prepare foods so as to preserve as much of their inherent character as possible.
Of course long cooking will make beans easier to mash, but this is a discussion of cooking beans in general, though, and not specifically about mashing them.
And your point about the work involved is just a matter of semantics.
Obviously the human isn't doing the work to generate the energy to cook the beans for six hours, but it still seems like an awful lot to invest if you just want to soften up some beans.
[[User:Crcarter|Clayton Carter]] 20:21, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

Beans are cheap and nutritious, and they have the right texture for a burrito. Do you know a substitute? Perhaps butter with rice flour and powdered milk? That wouldn't be cheap though. Mushroom paste? Again, not cheap or even available. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:24, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

===Farts, Flatulence, Gastric Distress and Wording===
I think that &quot;flatulence&quot; sounds better, esp. in the section heading.
The next sentence has an unambiguous reference to &quot;farting&quot;.
I don't think that flatulence is any less clear than farting, and it sounds a bit less silly.
[[User:Crcarter|Clayton Carter]] 20:21, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

Nothing sounds more silly than using a big long aristocratic word when a simple and common one will do. Come on, do people say &quot;oops, sorry I flatulated&quot;? Nobody I've ever known would use this word. Likewise, we don't use ''cranium'' all that much. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:53, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What area did they live in? ==
[[Image:Beginnings hist greece.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|The Beginnings of Historic Greece. 700 - 600 BC.]]
Ancient Greeks lived on the Balkan Peninsula (approximately at the territory of modern [[Wikijunior:Europe/Greece|Greece]]) and on the western part of Turkey.  They governed themselves from their cities, each of which had a separate government which governed over the countryside surrounding them.  There were quite a few of these city states, but their two greatest cities were Athens, in the north, and Sparta in the south.  The Greeks lived under their own rule until first being absorbed by the Macedonians, who lived to their north, and then finally the Roman Empire. Greece has many mountains and poor soil, which prevents many crops from being grown there. The country has a mild climate, which makes it convenient to farm goats and sheep. Also, Greece is a sea country: there are many beaches and islands, and no part of the country is far away from the sea. That made many of the Greeks sailors, and that meant that they sailed near and far, trading with different people, learning about other cultures, and bringing their own culture to faraway lands. These types of exchanges inspired development of Greek science and art.

== What did their structures look like? ==

Greek buildings were usually rectangular-shaped, surrounded by '''colonnades''' – rows of columns. Greece is rich in limestone, which was the most popular material of the time. Marble was more expensive, and was mostly used for statues and decoration. 

Greek theaters looked very much like modern ones, except that most were open to the weather. There were semi-circled rows of seats, each row was higher than the row in front of it, so that people in the back could see better. Centered in front of the audience was a circular '''orchestra''', where performances took place.  A low building called a '''skene''' sat behind the orchestra.  It was used to conceal actors, and gave room for costume changes, props and other &quot;backstage&quot; activity.

== What did they wear? ==
Greek men wore '''chitons''' – pieces of cloth pinned on one shoulder. Women wore '''peplos''' – long tube-shaped cloth, which was pinned on both shoulders and gathered around the waist. When it was cold, both men  and women wore a cloak, called '''clamys'''. Greeks wore sandals, which looked a lot like the sandals that we wear today.

== What did their writing look like? ==

[[Image:Stèle grecque1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Athenian decree from the 5th century BC]]

Greek writing looked a lot like Modern Greek text, written with capital letters. The Greek alphabet appeared in 8th century BC and was influenced by the Phoenician alphabet, the first alphabet that used signs for letters, not for words or syllables. Unlike the Phoenician alphabet, which did not have characters for vowels, the Greek alphabet had characters for all the sounds used in the language. In that sense it was the first modern alphabet, and the oldest to be used to this day. The Greek alphabet became a base for two other alphabets: Latin (that is used in English) and Cyrillic currently used in Slavic-speaking countries.

== What did they believe? ==

[[Image:Aphaia pediment 5 central Glyptothek Munich.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Athena]]

Greeks were '''polytheistic''', which means that they believed in many gods and goddesses. Each god or goddess was “responsible” for some side of life or natural phenomenon.

Twelve of the most important gods resided on mount Olympus. Their leader was Zeus, the god of the sky. Other Olympic gods were: his wife Hera - the goddess of marriage and motherhood, Poseidon – god of the sea, Aphrodite - the goddess of love, Apollo – the god of art and leader of muses - and Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, and the favorite daughter of Zeus.

[[Image:Kentaur Kreta asb 2004 PICT3436.jpg|thumbnail|240px|left|Centaur]]
Greeks believed in many mystical creatures other than gods: titans – children of Gaia, goddess of Earth, challenging Olympic gods; nymphs – nature spirits; muses – goddesses and patrons of art; centaurs – half humans, half horses; Cyclops – one eyed monsters; giants. 

In Greek myths, the Gods often had affairs with real people, and that’s how heroes, like Hercules – man of superhuman strength, who committed twelve labours, and Achilles – the hero of Trojan war, were born.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
[[Image:Homer.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Homer]]
We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists. Possibly the most known person of this culture is '''Homer''', the legendary blind poet, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems '''Iliad''' and '''Odyssey'''. '''Sophocles''' and '''Aristophanes''' are still popular playwrights and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature. Another famous Greek is a mathematician '''Pythagoras''', mostly known for his famous theorem about relations of the sides of right triangles. '''Archimedes''' made many amazing inventions and discoveries. The legend says that he discovered Archimedes Principle while taking a bath, and got so excited, that he ran out naked into the street crying “Eureka!” – “I have found it!” The philosopher '''Socrates''' taught to question everything, separating beliefs from proven facts. He even questioned the existence of gods, which got him in trouble: he was accused of corrupting the youth and was sentenced to death by taking poison. Other great philosophers include '''Aristotle''' (the teacher of '''Alexander the Great''') and '''Plato'''. '''Alexander the Great''' is known for his conquest of the Middle East and Central Asia.

== What is left of them today? ==
The whole modern country of Greece! They still speak the same language, though it has changed some, use the same alphabet and preserve their heritage.

[[Image:Lincoln Memorial Close-Up.jpg|thumbnail|240px|left|The Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.]]
But Greek heritage is not limited to Greece only. It influenced Western culture greatly. That's why we call it the Cradle of Western Civilization. We use many Greek words in our everyday life, like democracy, philosophy, photography. In fact, the word ''alphabet'' comes from ''alpha'' and ''beta'', the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. In mathematics, one of the greatest discoveries they made was about right-angled triangles which is still important in map making. Greek philosophers strongly influenced ideas in the West for many years and their ideas are still important in politics, religion, government, discussion and argument, and in how people should behave toward one another and in society as a whole. Greek architecture and art strongly influenced Western architecture and art. (What does Lincoln Memorial remind you of?) The foundation of our science came from Ancient Greece. The Greek style of sculpture is still used all over the world today for statues of famous people. The Greeks also invented the theater and many of their plays are still acted all over the world today. Many of their stories and poems are also read widely today. The Greeks were the ones who started the Olympic Games, back in 776 BC, in honor of the god Zeus at the town of Olympia. Soon their fun side became more important and they were not just religious festivals anymore. Games were held every four years until AD 394 and were later restarted in 1896. The first of the new Olympics was held in Greece in honor of their original home and they have grown to become popular worldwide.

== Overview ==

Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, better known as '''''Nearly Headless Nick''''', is the resident ghost of Gryffindor House at Hogwarts. He was almost beheaded on October 31, 1492 but the axe was too dull and, despite hitting his neck forty-five times, did not entirely decapitate him, hence his nickname.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] first meet Nearly Headless Nick at the Arrival Feast. Ron recognizes him, and names him, from a description he got from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|his brothers Fred and George]]. Asked why &quot;'''''Nearly''''' Headless&quot;, Nick demonstrates that his head is held on only by a thin remnant. Nick also says that he hasn't eaten for nearly four hundred years.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Returning to the castle sodden and muddy after a Quidditch practice, Harry meets a dismayed-looking Nearly Headless Nick, who has received a rejection letter from the Headless Hunt. (&quot;Half an inch of skin and sinew!&quot;) After hearing Harry's worries about the upcoming Quidditch match against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Slytherin House|Slytherin]], Nick sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Norris|Mrs. Norris]], and warns Harry that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] is on the warpath. Harry tries to avoid him but is caught and taken to Filch's office, where Filch starts filling out a detention form for the &quot;crime&quot; of &quot;Befouling the castle&quot;. A crash from overhead distracts him, and sends him out of the office. On his return, Filch sees that Harry has become aware of some correspondence on his desk, and dismisses him hurriedly.

Outside Filch's office, Harry once again finds Nearly Headless Nick, who says that he had convinced [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] to drop a heavy cabinet in the room over Filch's office to distract him, and is pleased that it had worked. He then invites Harry, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to his Deathday Party, celebrating his death on 31 October 1492.

The Trio attend Nick's party, and find that it is a rather gloomy affair, with Peeves at one point chasing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]] away in tears. To put a quite unsatisfactory cap on the evening, as Nearly Headless Nick starts to make his speech thanking everyone for coming, the Headless Hunt bursts in through the walls and starts a wild game. Harry, Ron, and Hermione make their escape quietly in amongst the hullabaloo.

As they leave, Harry hears a voice. Following the voice, and with Ron and Hermione following him, he finds Mrs. Norris, Petrified and hanging from a torch bracket. Called upon to explain what they had been doing just before finding Mrs. Norris, the Trio explain that they had been attending Nick's Deathday party.

Shortly before Christmas, Harry finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] Petrified, and Nearly Headless Nick, black and smoky instead of his usual white color, and apparently also unconscious. Nearly Headless Nick is wafted up to the Infirmary by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] with a large fan, at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s orders.

With help from Hermione, despite her being Petrified, Harry and Ron discover that the monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]]. While this creature can kill with a glance, nobody has died yet because nobody has looked at it directly. In particular, Justin Finch-Fletchley had looked at it through Nearly Headless Nick; and Nick had not been killed by it because he was actually already dead.

Although we don't see him at the Ending Feast, we are led to believe that Nick is revived at the same time as the Petrified students.

&lt;!-- Note to editors: I'm leaving this section head here because I am certain Nick is mentioned in PoA, even though there is as yet no cross-reference to him. I have a re-read scheduled where I will note all that happens to a bunch of characters, I'll add Nick's PoA exploits at that time. --&gt;
While Nearly Headless Nick has no direct role in this book, he is mentioned in passing.

At the Arrival Feast, Nick informs Harry, Ron, and Hermione that there almost was not a feast this year. Peeves, upset at not being invited to the Feast, had gotten into the kitchen and had been wreaking havoc amongst the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House Elves]] making it. Hermione is astounded to learn that there are over a hundred House-Elves in Hogwarts, attending to the needs of the students. Saying that she will not benefit from slave labour, she pushes aside her plate and refuses to eat any more.

Nearly Headless Nick is already sitting at the Gryffindor table when the Trio and Neville arrive, and they sit near him. When the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] sings its song, Ron asks if the Hat has ever given a warning before, Nick says certainly, but before he can complete his explanation he is interrupted by the start of the Sorting. Once the Sorting is complete, and food appears, Hermione asks him to continue his explanation. Nick says that whenever the Hat feels that the school is in danger, it warns that the school Houses must stand together in the face of the danger. Ron, despite the almost indecent glee with which he is stuffing his mouth, manages to ask how the Hat knows the school is in danger if it is a hat, and Nick points out that it does stay in the Headmasters' office, and likely hears what is passing there. At Harry's disbelief that he could ever join forces with Slytherin, Nick reproaches him, saying that the ghosts of the separate houses cooperate, that he would not, for instance, argue with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Bloody Baron|the Bloody Baron]]. At Ron's suggestion that Nick is scared of the Baron, Nick is highly affronted and leaves, settling further down the table beside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dennis Creevey|Dennis Creevey]].

As Harry heads to the Owlery to send a message to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] on the Saturday following his first week of school, he encounters Nearly Headless Nick, who warns him that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] is preparing a surprise for the next person who walks under the bust of Paracelsus. Harry confirms that this surprise involves the bust of Paracelsus falling on that person's head, then finds another way to the Owlery. Nick, meanwhile, heads off to look for the Bloody Baron, to see if he can put a stop to it.

After the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]], Harry chooses to pack his trunk rather than attend the Leaving Feast. Restless, he leaves the dormitory to walk the halls. He sees Nearly Headless Nick passing through a wall ahead of him, and calls him over, saying he wants a word. Nick is reluctant, but says he rather expected this. They go into a vacant classroom, and Harry asks Nick if there is any chance that Sirius could have become a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghost]]. Nick says that there is no chance. A certain amount of preparation is required, as well as unfinished business and a fear of death, and Sirius does not have any of that in sufficient quantity to make him want to stick around.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When Harry returns to Gryffindor Tower following his retrieving the memory from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], he is denied entrance to the Common Room by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|the Fat Lady]]. While he is trying to decide what to do, Nearly Headless Nick wanders past. Harry tells him that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] had set him this task, and now he has to wait until Dumbledore is back. Nick remarks that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Bloody Baron|the Bloody Baron]] had said that Dumbledore had returned, but that he seemed tired. Nick suggests that Dumbledore is likely in his office.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Harry has become convinced that the last [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] that he must find and destroy is actually the lost Diadem of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] tells him that it has not been seen in living memory. It occurs to Harry that &quot;living memory&quot; only applies to the living and that the castle ghosts have been around far longer than that. Nearly Headless Nick is eager to help in any way that a ghost can, and is somewhat upset that Harry doesn't want his help, but rather the help of the Ravenclaw house ghost. Despite being upset, however, he does point [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Grey Lady|the Grey Lady]] out to Harry.

== Strengths ==
Being a ghost, he is already dead, and so he cannot die; even the Monster in the Chamber, who we find out later is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]], cannot kill him.

== Weaknesses ==

Being a ghost, he has limited ability to interact with the regular world. He is, however, affected by some artifacts of the material world; as mentioned, he cannot be killed by the Basilisk, but he is injured by it, being more or less Petrified by its gaze, and he is then transferred to the Hospital Wing by means of a large fan, indicating that he is affected by air currents. One wonders if this sensitivity to air currents (e.g. wind) is the reason so few ghosts are found outdoors.

Like Moaning Myrtle, Nick does not like being reminded that he is dead. While Myrtle's reaction is to burst into tears and run away, Nick instead tends to become affronted before ostentatiously distancing himself from the offender.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Nick as the Gryffindor house ghost, socializes with all Gryffindors. He seems to be particularly fond of Harry, though he is quite pleased to speak with either Ron or Hermione. He is somewhat easily offended by Ron's repeatedly mentioning that he is dead, and on at least one occasion moves away from Ron after such an event.

Nick has been trying for centuries to join one particular ghostly group, the Headless Hunt, but is hindered by his not being actually headless. 

== Analysis ==

In many ways, Nearly Headless Nick would seem to be almost a stereotypical 15th Century noble, believing in the birthrights of nobility and becoming affronted when his dignity is impugned. Against this, of course, we have to weigh the fact that we don't really know how 15th Century nobility actually acted. Would they have even deigned to speak with &quot;commoners&quot; like the students at Hogwarts? The average reader doesn't know, but may believe that the nobility of the day felt themselves innately immeasurably superior to those born without titles. The author has to make a choice between historical realism, and story, and we note that in this case, as in most, she has chosen the characterization that makes for the best story. A more realistic Sir Nicholas would likely have jarred fiercely against the expectations of the modern reader; but his portrayal in this series is sufficiently different from that of the students that it evokes the flavour of the age without jarring. Readers who don't believe that Sir Nicholas is portrayed accurately for his era may remind themselves that he has had five hundred years observing how styles have changed in Hogwarts, and presumably has been able to adapt himself to those styles somewhat, in order to avoid being effectively ostracized by the House which he inhabits.

The prime reason for Nearly Headless Nick's introduction would seem to be intimation that death is not final. Nick is the first ghost we meet in the series, and so is the first suggestion that in this series, some form of life after death is proven fact. We will learn from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] that a ghost &quot;is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth,&quot; while Nick [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|will say]] that &quot;Wizards can leave their imprint on the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod.&quot; We note the implication that the soul itself has departed, but the imprint of that soul remains, and suggest that a similar mechanism may [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Paintings|animate portraits]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Photograph|photographs]] in the Wizarding world. However, existence of the soul being a proven fact in the Wizarding world is undoubtedly meant as comfort for Harry, following the death of his parents, and presumably provides that comfort in at least some measure. Nick, in the first four books, is a concrete manifestation of existence of the soul, and so shows Harry, and the reader, that belief before we are told of it.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], as mentioned, we learn that Nick is not an actual soul, but instead is the imprint of a soul who has passed on. The author, in an interview, has stated that the books became more concerned with death after the death of her mother. It may well be that, in coming to terms with her mother's passing, the author decided that leaving one's entire soul shackled to one place, even if it was as large a place as the Earth, would be a fate worse than death, and so altered her description of ghosts, as enunciated first by Nearly Headless Nick, to indicate that the actual soul of the wizard had departed.

Two things about Nearly Headless Nick have given readers pause. 

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 7|the first book]], he tells Harry that he has not eaten in almost four hundred years; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|the second book]], he invites Harry to his five hundredth deathday celebration. As there is not a hundred-year gap in Harry's life at this point, we must assume that either Nick has miscounted, or that the author has made a small mistake. As it turns out, the author, in later editions, corrected the number in the first book to bring them both into line, changing &quot;almost four hundred years&quot; to &quot;almost five hundred years,&quot; and thus firmly set the date of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's death at 31 October 1492.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 11|the second book]], Nearly Headless Nick is attacked by the monster from the Chamber and is left &quot;no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor.&quot; We will later find that a restorative draught based on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mandrake|mandrake root]] will revive all of those not fatally attacked by the Monster, but that does leave the question open: how does one administer a restorative draught to a ghost? This question is never fully answered, except perhaps by considering the dual meaning of the word &quot;draught.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Early-Historical-Israel-Dan-Beersheba-Judea-Corrected.png|thumbnail|200px|right|Map of Israel before it was divided]]

== Who are Hebrews? ==
'''Hebrews''' were ancestors of modern Jews. They claim to be the descendants of the biblical Patriarch Abraham. They are known for their input into world culture, because their beliefs have influenced 3 major religions of the world. They are also known for their cultural and spiritual laws, rules, and morals. The Hebrews have influenced society today to a high degree.

== What country did they live in? ==
Hebrews were nomadic people. They lived in the ancient Middle East. Around 1400 BC they settled in '''Canaan''', the country on the eastern coast of Mediterranean sea, the territory of modern Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Later this country was known as the kingdom of Israel and, after the death of King Solomon, was divided into Israel and Judea.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
In the warm climate of the Middle East the house was not so important. Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened in the open air.  Women did the cooking in the yard; stores were just open counters looking into the street.  Stone was used for building houses. There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.

When Hebrews were nomadic people, they lived in tents. But even when they settled, tents were very popular. Tents are often mentioned in the [[:w:Torah|Torah]], and even at the time of David and Solomon, living in a tent was common, especially for poor people.

Another option was living in a cave. The natural cave was enlarged and a wall was built in front, converting the cave into a sheltered home.

Wealthier people lived in the houses built of sun-dried mud bricks. The roofs of the houses were flat, so that people could stay outside in the cool evenings and sleep in summer. Domestic animals were kept on the first floor, together with people. There were no chimneys; smoke from cooking or heating fires escaped through the windows. The furniture was very simple. It included a few mats, spread upon the floor at night for sleeping, and rolled up during the day, or a kind of divan set against the wall; there were a table and chairs; a large jug for grain stood in the corner, and others for water, wine, oil, etc.; a niche in the wall held the lamp.

[[Image:Western wall jerusalem night.jpg|thumbnail|300px|left|Western Wall]]
But what made Hebrews really proud was the '''Jerusalem Temple'''. There were two temples built: the First Temple was built by King Solomon. Cedar wood for the construction was brought from Lebanon, and the walls and floor of the temple were covered with gold. The Ark of the Covenant was kept in the Holy of Holies, a room at the end of the temple. The first Temple was destroyed in 586 BC, when the Jews were exiled into the Babylonian Captivity.

After Jews returned from Captivity in 536 BC, they started building the Second Temple. This temple stood till AD 70, when it was destroyed by Romans. Another Temple was built and also destroyed. The only part that was left is from [[Herod's Temple]] and is the Outer Western Wall, a sacred site for Jewish people.  The Western Temple Mount wall is sometimes called the Wailing Wall and was believed to be from the second Temple and is often prayed near to, by the Jews today. This is also a &quot;Talmedic&quot; tradition.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

== What did they eat? ==
[[Image:2nd century Hebrew decalogue.jpg|right|170px|thumb|Second century Hebrew manuscript of Ten Commandments]]
Hebrew food was similar to the food of other Mediterranean people: they ate homemade bread that the lady of the house would bake in the big clay ovens in the yard, lentils, goat cheese, olives, and fresh fruits. Meat was rare, and usually eaten on special days. Fish was more common.  The most popular drink was wine.

But there was one difference about the food Hebrews ate: it had to be '''Kosher'''.  Kosher applied to all different types of food. It applied to meat which had to come from correctly slaughtered animals. These animals had to have split hooves and had to chew their cud. The fish they ate had to have fins and scales. The wine had to be made and supervised by a Hebrew at all times because other cultures would put blood in it to help it ferment and eating or drinking blood is not Kosher.
Some of the stricter Hebrews thought that meat should not be mixed with dairy, and that a person had to wait a few hours between having meat and dairy. This is a &quot;Talmudic&quot; tradition.

== What did they wear? ==
[[Image:PLATE4AX.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Jewish noblemen in ancient Judah]]
Both men and women wore a tunic with a girdle, a robe on top of it, and a mantle (a sleeveless over garment) and a headdress. Men's and women's clothes were different in style and pattern. Women’s garments were longer, with long sleeves. 

Hebrew laws also had instructions about their clothing. They were supposed to wear tassels on the corners of their clothing, a commandment from the Bible. Their clothes were never a mix of wool and flax except for the high priest who was permitted to wear such a mixture. The priests also had special instructions about the clothing that they wore while they worked.

== What did their writing look like? ==
[[Image:Torah.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Torah Scroll]]
From very ancient times, the Hebrews began to write down their history, laws, and beliefs. The first five books or the '''Torah'''. The &quot;Torah&quot; was written in Hebrew. The books were written on large pieces of parchment and rolled into scrolls. These books were Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. 

Hebrew was and is written right-to-left, with consonants and vowel points. The Hebrew script evolved over the course of their history so ancient Hebrew writing does not look the same as it does today. Here is an example of what ancient Hebrew writing looked like:

[[Image:Omri.melek.israel.gif|200px]]

== What did they believe? ==
Hebrews were among the first people in the world whose religion was '''monotheistic'''. Monotheism is the belief that there is only one God. All of their neighbors were polytheistic: they believed in many gods and goddesses that looked and behaved like humans. The idea that there is a single God who cannot be seen and is present everywhere and knows everybody’s thoughts was very unusual at that time. YHWH, יהוה or Yahweh, pronounced Yah-way and translates to &quot;I Am&quot;, is the original Hebrew name of the Heavenly Father and the Jews believe saying his name is a forbidden. They use Adoni, pronounced Add-doe-nigh instead. He is also called El or Elohim in the Hebrew bible.

According to the ''Torah,'' the first person to start spreading the concept of one God was the patriarch Abraham. Monotheistic beliefs are currently found in many religions all over the world. 

The Hebrews believed that they were God's chosen people and that the Torah contained God's laws which must be followed.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
[[File:Moises.jpg|right|thumb|Michelangelo Buonarrotti. Moses]]
Many biblical heroes are known today.  The Bible became the most published book in the world, and, since so much of it was written about Hebrews, many Hebrew historical figures became famous. Many books, paintings and even movies are dedicated to them.

* '''Abraham''', '''Isaac''', and '''Jacob''' are the three patriarchs.

* '''Joseph''' - '''Jacob's''' second youngest son born to him in his old age. According to the '''Torah''' he was sold in to slavery and ended up in Egypt, where he worked for Pharaoh. His most famous job was interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, which led to him saving Eygpt having a famine while the rest of the world was having one. 
 
* '''Moses''' - Considered by many people to be one of the greatest leaders of Jewish people, and according to the Torah he is called the most humble man that ever lived. The most notable according to the '''Torah''' he took the Hebrews out of slavery from Eygpt, God through him brought 10 plagues to Egypt, split the Red Sea, received the '''Torah''' along with the '''Ten Commandments''' and the oral Jewish law, set up the Jewish courts, took them to the land of Canaan - the land God promised to them through Abraham.

* '''King David''' - One of three kings of ancient Israel and ruler of the largest territorial extent of ancient Israel.  He was a significant military leader and lead the ancient Israelite armies in many successful battles.  He wrote most of the songs in the '''Book of Psalms'''.
 
* '''King Solomon''' - During his reign the kingdom of Israel reached its greatest prosperity, being one of the biggest powers in trade. He was known for his wisdom and justice. He also wrote songs in the '''Book of Psalms'''.

* '''Queen Esther''' -Or Hadassah, queen of Persia, according to the '''Esther''' she saved Jewish people from evil plans of Minister Haman to kill all Jews throughout the Persian Empire. This event is celebrated during the Jewish holiday of Purim.

[[File:Jesus_and_the_doctors_of_the_Faith_dsc01783.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Jesus speaking with Jewish teachers at age 12]]
*'''Jesus of Nazareth''' - Jesus is one of the most famous Hebrew of all. He was born in Bethlehem to Hebrew parents. He grew up in Nazareth, which is a part of Israel. He also became spiritual leader and many of his early followers were also Hebrew and are still famous today, such as the apostles Paul, Peter and John. Eventually Jesus became Christ and even God in the Christian faith.

== What is left of them today? == 
Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by Assyrians in 722 BC. Judea lost its independence to Rome in the first century AD. Jews had to leave their country. For two thousand years they lived all over the world, preserving their religion, language and traditions. They survived through centuries of discrimination and prejudice and through the extermination of one third of the Jewish population of the world in the Second World War. In 1948 the state of Israel was established again.

Hi, my name is Graeme McRae. I have always been a stickler for proper word usage and grammar, and this makes me annoyed at articles with clumsy wording or dumb mistakes of any kind. With Wikipedia, I can channel that frustration into positive action to polish the &quot;surface&quot; of the articles at the same time I learn from the underlying content.&amp;nbsp;  ([[Special:Contributions/GraemeMcRae|My contributions]])&amp;nbsp; ([http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=GraemeMcRae&amp;dbname=enwiki My Edit Count Stats])&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I have a [http://mcraeclan.com/Graeme personal webpage] that I use kind of as a blog, for ranting about (or appreciating) various things, and a [http://mcraefamily.com/MathHelp math page] that I use for describing some very cool things about math, in a way that might help people understand them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If you would like to leave me a message, edit my [[User Talk:GraemeMcRae|User Talk]] page, and put your comment at the bottom.  I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

= Constructing a Complex Derivation =

== An example derivation ==

Subderivations can be nested.  For an example, we provide a derivation for the argument

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{T},\ \ \mathrm{S} \land \lnot \mathrm{T},\ \ \mathrm{S} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''&amp;there4;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We begin with the premises and then assume the antecedent of the conclusion.

Note. Each time we begin a new subderivation and enter a temporary assumption, there is a specific formula we are hoping to derive when it comes time to end the derivation and discharge the assumption.  To make things easier to follow, we will add this formula to the annotation of the assumption.  That formula will not officially be part of the annotation and does not affect the correctness of the derivation.  Instead, it will serve as an informal reminder to ourselves noting where we are going.

This starts a subderivation to derive the argument's conclusion.  Now we will try a Disjunction Elimination (DE) to derive its consequent:

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


This will require the showing two conditionals we need for the antecedent lines of a DE, namely:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


We begin with the first of these conditionals.

|- style=&quot;height:10px&quot;

This subderivation is easily finished.

| &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;

|-
|}
|}


Now we are ready to discharge the two assumptions at Lines 5 and 6.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| 5&amp;ndash;10 CI
|-
|}
|}


Now it's time for the second conditional needed for our DE planned back at Line 4.  We begin.

| &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 3, 14 CE
|-
|}
|}


Note that we have a contradiction between Lines 12 and 15.  But line 12 is in the wrong place.  We need it in the same subderivation as Line 15.  A silly trick at Lines 16 and 17 below will accomplish that.  Then the assumptions at Lines 12 and 13 can be discharged.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;

| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| 12&amp;ndash;18 CI

|}

Finally, with Lines 4, 11, and 19, we can perform the DE we've been wanting since Line 4.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| 4, 11, 19 DE
|-
|}
|}


Now to finish the derivation by discharging the assumption at Line 4.

''Sociology systematically studies how groups of people are affected differently by human behavior patterns. A deeper understanding of how people make sense of their lives and act to create, maintain, and change the world around them accordingly can aid us in improving our own lives and the lives of others.'' This is but one short summary of what some people (&quot;process&quot; sociologists particularly) believe the essence of sociology to be.... there are many other different and sometimes rivaling conceptualizations.

==Introduction==
This is an open source curricular module, not a &quot;course&quot; in the traditional sense.  There are no schedules, due dates, or tests as would be found in traditional higher education settings.  Since there are no real &quot;correct&quot; answers for students to [re]produce, there is no one hallowed book of knowledge to be had here.  Instead, what this medium offers is the promise of effectively compiling and organizing virtually unlimited information resources from which users can pick and choose from as they see fit or their situation demands.  What may be lost via lack of corporeality, temporality, and formality in the way of grades and credits can be made up for in the expansive potential for discovery based learning in such a novel context.  I hope this space will develop into a repository for a multiplicity of perspectives and intellectual exercises built for people looking for interesting and diverse segways into the study of human societies.  To begin, I have made my uncopyrighted materials for the course I teach at the University of Florida available here and hope that other educators, interested parties, and diligent students will soon add on to this scaffolding.  Perhaps the &quot;experts&quot; who come forth to contribute to this project will also make themselves available to answer questions that truly inquiring minds must produce.  This model should foster an enlarged body of engaged participants that become invested in adding onto and improving this forum exponentially, as is the greatest promise and observed tendency of wikis everywere.

==Textbook==
Our textbook, should you choose to accept it, is a [[/Introduction to Sociology|Introduction to Sociology]] open source ebook. The topics below correspond to the organization found in this text.  

==Activities==
The weakest link in this format is its lack of structure or accountability.  Utilizing the information optimally will likely be difficult for most folks who just drop in and browse around at will.  Instead, I would suggest that students follow the material in a somewhat linear manner, at least until (hopefully) the topics below become so diversified that this path becomes unwieldy.  Please, fret not that the lack of testing of your reading comprehension via multiple choice assesments means that you will not really &quot;learn&quot; anything, for there exists a superior pedagogical strategy that is uniquely facilitated by open source wikis such as this one.  The key to really &quot;getting&quot; this stuff is to &quot;make it your own&quot; by criticizing it and creatively expanding on it.  This means that you should actively try to edit all the materials you encounter.  Now, arbitrary and/or uninformed changes are not the goal here - instead, you should spend a significant amount of time wrestling intellectually with the ideas and exploring the issues and concepts on wikipedia that relate to the particular discussion topic at hand.  The discussion space for each subtopical article is the perfect place to start broaching ideas for substansive changes, but you can also use the email contacts below.  The main idea here is that the level of learning you achieve through this activity will be directly proportionate to the amount of time and effort you expend trying to contribute to the materials via attempting to improve them.  In fact, a diligent student could make big contributions by simply linking the somewhat obscure terms found throughout the texts to wikipedia articles.  More in depth work would include stepping beyond existing materials and developing new discussions of interesting and relevant subject matters.  A full assimilation of the knowledge found herein is best achieved by utilizing it in a wholly new context, that is, by writing new articles, hopefully suplemented by outside information sources and multimedia of all kinds.

'''Sociological Visions of Ethics and Responsibility drawn from ideas featured in Conversations with Zygmunt Bauman'''

''In this world there is beauty and there are the humiliated… whatever difficulties this situation may present we should all strive to never be unfaithful to either.'' – Albert Camus

As a general rule, in any society at any given time, there is more humiliation and misery occurring than society notices, more still than it admits, and much more still than it resolves to alleviate or rectify. This is the prime reason why justice is always a distant cry , far ahead and out of reach from everything we do for human well-being and dignity. However, we can't be faithful to the humiliated unless we at least reach for beauty.

Social thought is done for the benefit of humanity when it shows us how we can refuse to act in systematically hurtful ways even while living under circumstances that make the cruel treatment of others seem easy to accept. As relatively free beings, it is possible to choose to care a little more. In that choice lies our human dignity and our sense of morality. The role of critical sociology is to make these choices more accessible by demonstrating that our currently socially acceptable ways of thinking and acting are based on historically isolated and likely flawed sets of social ethics .

Sociologists are not unrealistic utopians who think they know how to finally set the world right to insure that all people live eternally in peace and harmony. This can be rejected on the grounds that the practice of sociology is implicitly tied to the values of the particular culture that surrounds it – those which likewise bind all men and women in the community of social thinkers. However, sociology is an important agent in re-imagining and redoing the current world. It is hoped that this deprives the prevailing institutions of the day the air of invulnerability they desperately need to continue to operate unopposed. What sociology badly needs to fulfill its mandate is an enlarged public forum in which people can come together to recreate their world first in ideas, without the fear that all our hopes and ambitions will be overshadowed by the public desire to make a spectacle out of private lives. It is this forum that our society conspicuously and disastrously lacks and needs to revitalize politics, especially in this time of greatest need.

The effort to give some social choices preference over other alternatives is what we call “ethics”. Society is an ongoing effort to increase the probability of some choices occurring over others. Thus, sociology cannot but be inquiry into the ways in which ethical rules are constructed . Societies are systems of coordinated choices and any society you study is but one reality chosen among many . Society may be “good” or “bad” depending on different beliefs, but in each case it may be better than it is. Being moral means accepting that new choices may be good or may be bad, but it does not mean knowing, let alone knowing for sure which are good and which are bad. Being moral means being bound to make such new choices under conditions of acute and painful uncertainty. To be moral means never to feel good enough about our choices or about the current state of our world – this is the restlessness associated with being human.

Often ethics comes in handy as a tranquilizer, as a drug to mitigate pangs of conscience. However, becoming dependent on the same tired old ethics of justification may in the long run destroy our moral immune system and deprive the self of the little ability it might have had in facing up to tough moral dilemmas and going after the good on its own volition. This restless and indefatigable search for ways to do away with the wrongs of our world never runs a straight line since new actions bring with them new evils . History has been more like a pendulum that a straight edge ruler. To defend ourselves from the evils perpetrated in the past, we march with our backs turned toward the future, but no sooner do we turn to scrutinize the future than it becomes in its turn a past with ugliness showing anew.

Modernity has often been about making the world a “clean” and predictable place. Ordering the world in such a preplanned fashion means making reality vastly different than it currently is by getting rid of the ingredients of reality which are deemed to be responsible for the impurity of the certain human conditions. On this path, we may quickly arrive at a verdict that some people should be refused help, thrown out, or destroyed in the name of a greater good and someone else's greater happiness. Would we be better or worse off without the modern ethos? No one really knows… we still need to wait for full inventory to be made of the atrocities which it may have blinded us to thus far. Modernity's forte is the power of its tools. What counts in the measurements of its success are efficiency, speed, and the scale of performance. Its weakness is the vagueness and uncertainty about the ends to which these tools may be applied. There is a fast growing imbalance between the means we (as members of the privileged lot of humanity) have at our disposal and the ends which we collectively can agree on as worthy of our attention and effort.

If you think you know exactly what the good society is like, then any cruelty you commit in its name is justified and absolved. We can abstain from self-assured acts of cruelty only when we are unsure of our wisdom and admit the possibility of our own ideological fallibility. The ghastly failure of our utopias has turned peoples' thoughts away from what a better life would require to be done in the here and now. It seems that societies manipulate morality rather than produce it. Powerful groups enforce the kinds of morality that advance their own interests. It is this socially produced reality which needs to justify itself, to be tried and judged at the tribunal of ethics.

Freedom may be the natural condition of humanity, but most of human history has been dedicated to repression. S ecuring bare necessities for all people is the secret to releasing humanity's amazing creative potential. In these times of “liquid modernity”, the hoops one must jump through to achieve security are notorious for being melted as soon as they are molded. For too many, there are only motel beds and sleeping bags available for readjustment. We are told daily that our possibilities are unlimited and that we need only pick and choose those that fit us best. We are then punished for failing to find the best of these advertised alternatives, as if what we had been told of their availability had some guarantee attached. This myth cannot become true for more people as long as the present-day decoupling of freedom and security persists. These two values cannot be entertained separately.

We are encouraged to believe that security is in fact disabling, responsible for breeding the kind of dependency that is thought to constrain human freedom. However, acrobatics and tight rope walking without a [social] safety net is an art few people can master and recipe for disaster for all the rest. Take away security and freedom is the first casualty. Most modern atrocities have been byproducts of a desperate search for security. As older unchanging and self-reproducing orders collapsed under the changes of modernity, quelling the fears brought on by this disturbance was brought to obsessive extremes by modernity, which allowed ever more desperate and destructive responses

Freedom is the uppermost among human values but first and foremost it is a fate. Free beings, if they are indeed free, may embrace that fate or try to escape it, make it into their vocation or fight against it: this is also the capacity to which they owe their freedom. Often freedom seems to be an ambivalent value because it sometimes attracts and repels at the same time. It is disconcerting and frightening to account for one's actions using the terms “I had to” instead of “I wanted to”. Hence the treacherous allure of “there is no alternative” ideologies as well as many of the awesome seductive powers of totalitarian regimes. Remember, there is never a shortage of offers to absolve us of our freedoms .

By itself, the idea of justice has no specific meaning. It only makes sense as a protest against injustice. A just society is a society which considers itself not just enough, which questions the sufficiency of any achieved level of justice and considers justice always to be a step more ahead. A just society is one which reacts angrily to any case of injustice and promptly sets about correcting it. While modernity has blurred many traditional distinctions between justice and injustice, its promise is provide more information on which to base our judgments. Today, the concept of injustice is more hotly contested than any other time in history. However, fast-paced change in the structure and content of our lives has made the idea of justice hazier than ever before. Since justice can only be described as an ever changing ideal, the just society must seek it through ongoing controversy, not majority rule consensus. Like modernity, justice is not just an unfinished project, it is an unfinishible project with only a very limited conception of future directions.

What is more noticeable these days is the tendency to ignore or brush off some of the world's most brutal and excessive differences in standards of living (caused both by particularities in human history and by the current economic regime) as “facts of nature” about which we collectively can do nothing but humbly accept and obey. This happens while the moral alertness of the public is redirected to focus on the demands for recognition from small groups and categories of people sufficiently free and resourceful enough to choose a new lifestyle and demanded its acceptance.

The increasing global effects of our local actions necessitate responsibility on a scale which has never been confronted before. Global power demands global responsibility. The latter has been much slower to arrive even as it finds itself increasingly impotent in the face of consolidated transnational corporate power. The fraction of our income or gross domestic product we are prepared to share with faraway impoverished people who are deprived of livelihood partly as a result of our economy's global search for wealth is pitifully tiny. Investing in the poor may be a morally correct act, but it makes no economic sense under capitalism – less money in wealthy consumers' pockets only raises prices.The problem of finding ways to catch up with rapidly globalizing economic powers by means of our local and national institutions of democracy may presently constitute the major challenge to our standards of justice and morality.

There is a contemporary feeling amongst individuals even in the most free and affluent societies that some of the most basic and important patterns of their lives simply cannot be changed and concern with these problems will only be a waste of time. This is because for the most part the roots of whatever troubles us most and stands in the way of a dignified and morally satisfied life are stuck well beyond the reach of our individual action. These roots are socially planted and cultivated and only collectively can they be dug up and detoxified . Once set in motion, individualization is a self-propelling and self-intensifying process. One of its foremost effects is the undermining of the possibility to act socially to question society and then following this critique with a shared strategy. It is the task of sociology to reconstitute society as the common property and responsibility of free individuals aiming at a dignified life.

With the world changing faster every day, levels of anxiety and isolation continue to rise as individuals and families attempt to cope alone – resulting in very negative consequences for some. With the almost forgotten ties of the extended family out of reach in times of need and insecurity, many people long for a community they can no longer locate. We cannot help missing the missing community but the community we miss cannot be found. Most disconcerting to today's consumer masses is that it cannot be commissioned or made on demand. A true community must be able to address serious crises collectively, but also secure stable and productive lives for its individual members. Like cultures, true communities are not as much impositions of fixed identities as they are processes of making sense with and through others. Our culture should be a knife pressed against the future…

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]}}

== Overview ==

The '''''Expelliarmus''''' spell is the Disarming spell; it knocks the victim's weapon out of his/her hands. When it is performed with more power, &lt;!--or if the victim is unarmed,--&gt; one can blast the opponent off their feet.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We see this spell first used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 11|the Dueling Club]]; Snape casts it on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]], disarming him and throwing him to the end of the platform on which they are demonstrating. Later in the same book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] casts the same spell on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], causing the book that he is holding, Riddle's diary, to fly out of his hand. From this point on, it is used quite often when there is a duel between wizards; if you can get your opponent to lose his wand, you do have a great advantage over him. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] warns Harry about the use of this spell, as it is being recognized as Harry's signature spell, and suggesting that he use more powerful defensive magic.

== Analysis ==

As mentioned, at one point Harry does use this spell to get someone to drop a book; as the diary is obviously not a weapon, we can see that this spell will act on anything that is held in the hand, not just a weapon or wand. It's possible that there is a mental part of this spell as well, envisioning the specific object that you want to have it act on; alternately, it could work on whatever you are pointing your wand at. In ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] all cast this spell at the same time, and it not only pulls Snape's wand out of his hand, but also throws him against the wall. This leads us to believe that the power of the spell is additive when cast by multiple wizards on the same object.

Despite the fact that the charm can do things other than disarm, its main function is to get an attacker to drop his wand; as such, it is referred to as the Disarming spell.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# In the seventh book, it appears that this is taken to be Harry's &quot;signature spell&quot;. Why would that be?
# In the seventh book, we learn that there can be other effects from the use of this spell. What would those be?

      <comment>/* Overview */ remove redundant subset test</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Dictionaries|Operators}}

Starting with version 2.3, Python comes with an implementation of the mathematical set. Initially this implementation had to be imported from the standard module &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt;, but with Python 2.6 the types set and [[#frozenset|frozenset]] became built-in types. A set is an unordered collection of objects, unlike sequence objects such as lists and tuples, in which each element is indexed. Sets cannot have duplicate members - a given object appears in a set 0 or 1 times. All members of a set have to be hashable, just like dictionary keys. Integers, floating point numbers, tuples, and strings are hashable; dictionaries, lists, and other sets (except frozensets) are not.

===Overview===
Sets in Python at a glance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
set1 = set()                   # A new empty set
set1.add(&quot;cat&quot;)                # Add a single member
set1.update([&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;])  # Add several members
if &quot;cat&quot; in set1:              # Membership test
  set1.remove(&quot;cat&quot;)
#set1.remove(&quot;elephant&quot;) - throws an error
print set1
for item in set1:              # Iteration AKA for each element
  print item
print &quot;Item count:&quot;, len(set1) # Length AKA size AKA item count
isempty = len(set1) == 0       # Test for emptiness
set1 = set([&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;])     # Initialize set from a list
set2 = set([&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;])
set3 = set1 &amp; set2             # Intersection
set4 = set1 | set2             # Union
set5 = set1 - set3             # Set difference
set6 = set1 ^ set2             # Symmetric difference
issubset = set1 &lt;= set2        # Subset test
issuperset = set1 &gt;= set2      # Superset test
set7 = set1.copy()             # A shallow copy
set7.remove(&quot;cat&quot;)
set8 = set1.copy()
set8.clear()                   # Clear AKA empty AKA erase
print set1, set2, set3, set4, set5, set6, set7, set8, issubset, issuperset
&lt;/source&gt;

===Constructing Sets===

One way to construct sets is by passing any sequential object to the &quot;set&quot; constructor.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; set([0, 1, 2, 3])
set([0, 1, 2, 3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(&quot;obtuse&quot;)
set(['b', 'e', 'o', 's', 'u', 't'])
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also add elements to sets one by one, using the &quot;add&quot; function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = set([12, 26, 54])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.add(32)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
set([32, 26, 12, 54])
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that since a set does not contain duplicate elements, if we add one of the members of s to s again, the add function will have no effect.  This same behavior occurs in the &quot;update&quot; function, which adds a group of elements to a set.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.update([26, 12, 9, 14])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
set([32, 9, 12, 14, 54, 26])
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that you can give any type of sequential structure, or even another set, to the update function, regardless of what structure was used to initialize the set.

The set function also provides a copy constructor.  However, remember that the copy constructor will copy the set, but not the individual elements.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = s.copy()
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2
set([32, 9, 12, 14, 54, 26])
&lt;/source&gt;

===Membership Testing===

We can check if an object is in the set using the same &quot;in&quot; operator as with sequential data types.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 32 in s
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6 in s
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6 not in s
True
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also test the membership of entire sets.  Given two sets &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;, we check if &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[w:Subset|subset]] or a superset of &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.issubset(set([32, 8, 9, 12, 14, -4, 54, 26, 19]))
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.issuperset(set([9, 12]))
True
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that &quot;issubset&quot; and &quot;issuperset&quot; can also accept sequential data types as arguments

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.issuperset([32, 9])
True
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the &lt;= and &gt;= operators also express the issubset and issuperset functions respectively.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; set([4, 5, 7]) &lt;= set([4, 5, 7, 9])
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; set([9, 12, 15]) &gt;= set([9, 12])
True
&lt;/source&gt;

Like lists, tuples, and string, we can use the &quot;len&quot; function to find the number of items in a set.

===Removing Items===

There are three functions which remove individual items from a set, called pop, remove, and discard.  The first, pop, simply removes an item from the set.  Note that there is no defined behavior as to which element it chooses to remove.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = set([1,2,3,4,5,6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.pop()
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
set([2,3,4,5,6])
&lt;/source&gt;

We also have the &quot;remove&quot; function to remove a specified element.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.remove(3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
set([2,4,5,6])
&lt;/source&gt;

However, removing a item which isn't in the set causes an error.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.remove(9)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
KeyError: 9
&lt;/source&gt;

If you wish to avoid this error, use &quot;discard.&quot;  It has the same functionality as remove, but will simply do nothing if the element isn't in the set

We also have another operation for removing elements from a set, clear, which simply removes all elements from the set.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.clear()
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
set([])
&lt;/source&gt;

===Iteration Over Sets===

We can also have a loop move over each of the items in a set.  However, since sets are unordered, it is undefined which order the iteration will follow.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = set(&quot;blerg&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for n in s:
...     print n,
...
r b e l g
&lt;/source&gt;

===Set Operations===

Python allows us to perform all the standard mathematical set operations, using members of set.  Note that each of these set operations has several forms.  One of these forms, s1.function(s2) will return another set which is created by &quot;function&quot; applied to &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;.  The other form, s1.function_update(s2), will change &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; to be the set created by &quot;function&quot; of &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, some functions have equivalent special operators.  For example, s1 &amp; s2 is equivalent to s1.intersection(s2)

====Intersection====

Any element which is in both &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; will appear in their [[w:intersection_(set_theory)|intersection]].

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = set([4, 6, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = set([1, 6, 8])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.intersection(s2)
set([6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 &amp; s2
set([6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.intersection_update(s2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1
set([6])
&lt;/source&gt;

====Union====

The [[w:union_(set_theory)|union]] is the merger of two sets.  Any element in &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; will appear in their union.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = set([4, 6, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = set([1, 6, 8])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.union(s2)
set([1, 4, 6, 8, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 | s2
set([1, 4, 6, 8, 9])
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that union's update function is simply &quot;update&quot; [[#Constructing_Sets|above]].

====Symmetric Difference====

The [[w:symmetric_difference|symmetric difference]] of two sets is the set of elements which are in one of either set, but not in both.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = set([4, 6, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = set([1, 6, 8])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.symmetric_difference(s2)
set([8, 1, 4, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 ^ s2
set([8, 1, 4, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.symmetric_difference_update(s2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1
set([8, 1, 4, 9])
&lt;/source&gt;

====Set Difference====

Python can also find the [[w:Complement_(set_theory)#Relative_Complement|set difference]] of &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;, which is the elements that are in &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; but not in &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = set([4, 6, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = set([1, 6, 8])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.difference(s2)
set([9, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 - s2
set([9, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.difference_update(s2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1
set([9, 4])
&lt;/source&gt;

===Multiple sets===
Starting with Python 2.6, &quot;union&quot;, &quot;intersection&quot;, and &quot;difference&quot; can work with multiple input by using the set constructor. For example, using &quot;set.intersection()&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = set([3, 6, 7, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = set([6, 7, 9, 10])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s3 = set([7, 9, 10, 11])
&gt;&gt;&gt; set.intersection(s1, s2, s3)
set([9, 7])
&lt;/source&gt;

===frozenset===
A frozenset is basically the same as a set, except that it is immutable - once it is created, its members cannot be changed. Since they are immutable, they are also hashable, which means that frozensets can be used as members in other sets and as dictionary keys. frozensets have the same functions as normal sets, except none of the functions that change the contents (update, remove, pop, etc.) are available.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fs = frozenset([2, 3, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = set([fs, 4, 5, 6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1
set([4, frozenset([2, 3, 4]), 6, 5])
&gt;&gt;&gt; fs.intersection(s1)
frozenset([4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; fs.add(6)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
&lt;/source&gt;

===Exercises===
#Create the set {'cat', 1, 2, 3}, call it s.
#Create the set {'c', 'a', 't', '1', '2', '3'}.
#Create the frozen set {'cat', 1, 2, 3}, call it fs.
#Create a set containing the frozenset fs, it should look like {frozenset({'cat', 2, 3, 1})}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Frankfurt School and Communication Theory ==

“I thought Adorno, on our first meeting, the most arrogant, self-indulgent (intellectually and culturally) man I have ever met. Some 20 years later, I can think of additional claimants for that position, but I doubt if they are serious rivals” (Donald MacRae, cited in Morrison, 1978, pp. 331-332). 

The [[w:Frankfurt School|Frankfurt School]] was a group of critical theorists associated with the Institut für Sozialforschung (Institute of Social Research) which was located first at the [[w:Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] (1923-1933), then in Geneva, Switzerland (1933-35), [[w:Columbia University|Columbia University]] in New York (1935-1949), and finally back at the University of Frankfurt, from 1949 to present.  Some of the theorists associated with what became known as the Frankfurt School included Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno (née Wiesengrund), [w:Herbert Marcuse], Walter Benjamin, Erich Fromm, Leo Lowenthal, and Friedrich Pollock.  

Felix Weil began the Institute of Social Research in 1923.  The theoretical basis of the Institute was Marxist, to no small degree because of Carl Grünberg, who served as director from 1923-1930.  Max Horkheimer succeeded Grünberg as director and served in that capacity until 1960, when Theodor Adorno became director, until his death in 1969.  These theorists were all associated with the Institute in the 1920s, except for Marcuse, who began working with the Institute in 1932.  From the late 1950s Jürgen Habermas would be involved with the Institute, but for a number of reasons his work is often considered separate from that of the Frankfurt School.  The Institute for Social Research continues to operate at the University of Frankfurt, but what is known as the Frankfurt School did not extend beyond the  theorists associated with it.  

The interests of the Frankfurt School theorists in the 1920s and 1930s lay predominantly in a Marxist analysis of social and economic processes, and the role of the individual and the group in relation to these processes.  Their particular relevance to communication theory lies primarily in Adorno's idea of the culture industry, and Marcuse's concept of the &quot;one dimensional&quot; man.

== The Culture Industry ==

In 1947 [[w:Horkheimer|Max Horkheimer]] and Theodor Adorno published ''Dialektik der Aufklärung: Philosophische Fragmente'', whose title was translated into English (in 1972) as ''Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments''.  One of the sections of this book was concerned with what Horkheimer and Adorno called the culture industry.  It was their contention that the culture industry was the result of an historical process that with an increase in technology (including mass communication technology) there was an increase in the ability to produce commodities, which enabled increased consumption of goods.  The consumption of mechanically reproduced cultural products—predominantly radio and film—led to formulas of producing them for entertainment purposes, and it did not occur to consumers to question the idea that the entertainment presented to them had an ideological purpose or purposes.  Consumers adapted their needs around these cultural products, and in doing so no longer knew of anything else that they might desire, or that there might be anything else they could desire.  The entertainment that they enjoyed did not reflect their real social, political, or economic interests, but instead blinded them from questioning the prevailing system.  Entertainment also had the function of allowing the dominant system to replicate itself, which allowed for further expansion in production and consumption.  Thus, for Adorno and Horkheimer the culture industry worked in such a way that those who were under its influence would not even notice that they were being manipulated.

Subsequent to the book’s publication in 1947, theorists of the Frankfurt School knew of Adorno's concept of the culture industry, but the impact of his analysis of the culture industry was limited well into the sixties.  ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' did not receive a wider distribution until 1969, and although Herbert Marcuse continued the general idea of the culture industry in his ''One-Dimensional Man'' of 1964, he did not refer to it as such.  In spite of Marcuse’s incisive criticism of dominant ideological structures, there is not a cultural component in his thought that can be separated out from ideology as a whole, as appears in the work of Adorno and Horkheimer.  Thus, as a concept relating to communication theory in the United States, the culture industry can more properly be said to have come to existence due to the English translation of Adorno and Horkheimer’s book in 1972.

== Genesis of “The Culture Industry” ==

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact.  The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood movies.  That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Theordor Wiesengrund enrolled at the University of Frankfurt in 1921 not only to study philosophy, but music.  Wiesengrund published in the 1920s and early 1930s under the name Theodor Wiesengrund-Adorno, and later took the name Adorno, which had been his mother’s maiden name.  According to Thomas Mann, Adorno refused to choose between music and philosophy throughout his entire life, believing that he was pursuing the same objective in two disparate fields (Jäger, 2004, p. 31).  Although he wrote his doctoral thesis on Husserl, and a postdoctoral thesis on Kierkegaard, Adorno moved to Vienna to study music composition with Alban Berg. Most of Adorno's music was written between 1925 and 1930, though he continued to compose music for the rest of his life.  In addition to composing, Adorno was a music critic and editor of ''Musikblatter des Anbruch'' from 1928 to 1932.  As a composer and music critic Adorno was aware of conditions relating to the production and dissemination of music in the 1920s and 1930s.  This aspect of Adorno’s career is important in understanding his subsequent approach to culture. Because he had a profound knowledge of art, which is great part of culture, his belief what the real art should be like influenced on his criticism against culture industry. To Adorno, the gist of real art is autonomy. Both of the production and the consumption of cultural product should be originated by autonomy which arouses uniqueness of real art. According to Adorno, culture industry which products and consumes the mass cultural product is not based on autonomy but passivity so that it never seeks for uniqueness of real art or culture. 

Adorno was introduced to [[w:Walter Benjamin|Walter Benjamin]] in 1923, and the two theorists became friends.  Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became in effect Benjamin's only pupil.  After Benjamin’s death “it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jäger, 2004, p. 65-6).  The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period.

Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute, and published articles in the ''Zeitschrift fur Socialforschung'' (Journal for Social Research) that had been set up by the Institute in 1932.  Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi party.  Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began operating there.  The Nazis' rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought.  As Jürgen Habermas would later note, the fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical experiences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl.  He was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. 

Already in the late 1930s Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture.  As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships.  The essay translated as “On the Fetish Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin’s more optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62).  A primary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records.  The result was inferior to the original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu impossible” (Adorno, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adorno, mass production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school was that of Adorno. 

In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazarsfeld.  Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was.  For his part, Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music.  Adorno wrote for the Project’s journal ''Radio Research'' in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live performance.  In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music to the masses (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 243).  While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adorno became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.  Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in Europe.  Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative in Europe.  The closest thing in Adorno’s experience to the advertising industry in the United States was fascist propaganda (Jäger, 2004, p. 122).

Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being “indistinguishable from political propaganda” (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97).  It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project.  Adorno’s dissatisfaction with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop the idea of the culture industry.  

Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until November 1941.  When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Döblin, and Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry.  The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany. 
  
According to Douglas Kellner, Max Horkheimer wanted to write a “great book on dialectics,” and Herbert Marcuse, who had been admitted to the Institute in 1932, was eager to work on the project.  While Horkheimer (and later Adorno) moved to California, Marcuse went to work for the Office of Strategic Services (the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency), and later the State Department.  Thus it was Adorno and not Marcuse who became Horkheimer’s co-author on the project on dialectics (Kellner, 1991, p. xviii).  The work that resulted was ''The Dialectic of Enlightenment'', with its section titled “The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception” drafted by Adorno.  

These preconditions—Adorno’s interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry—are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

== “The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception” ==

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art.  They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology “to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce” (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95).  This business was based on what Adorno referred to as “Fordist capitalism,” in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 142).  Examples of this—not specified by Adorno—were the Hollywood production system, or the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project.  Movies and hit songs were based on formulas, and “the formula supplants the work” (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 99).  Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system, and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 106-7).  Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules.  The elasticity in the system would allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual (Friedman, 1981, p. 165).  Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic coercion ultimately meant the “freedom to be the same” (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, “The Culture Industry” has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.  Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 101).  It was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture industry, but modernism.  Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry, Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis.  Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement, but refused to do so when it was a question of abolishing hunger (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 111).  

''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' was issued in mimeograph form in 1944, in German, and thus would have limited impact outside of the expatriate community.  In the meantime Adorno began working, along with Else Frenkel-Brunswik, Daniel Levinson, and R. Nevitt Sanford, on an empirical investigation into prejudice titled ''The Authoritarian Personality''.  He wrote ''Minima Moralia: Reflections on Damaged Life'' in 1945, and this work, upon its publication in Germany in 1951, would mark the beginning of his impact in Germany (Jäger, 2004, p. 167).  Adorno would also co-author ''Composing for the Films'' with Hans Eisler, and in this text Adorno made it clear that the culture industry is not identical with high or low art (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 134).  This is perhaps the first of several of Adorno’s attempts at redefining the culture industry to an audience that in all probability had no exposure to the concept as it was detailed in the original essay.

== Return to Germany ==

''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' was published in Amsterdam in German in 1947 with a number of variants, excluding words and phrases in the published edition that could be construed as being Marxist (Morris, 2001, p. 48).  Their apparent intent was to not attract the attention of the American occupation authorities in Germany.  One of the main reasons for this is that Horkheimer wanted to return the Institute for Social Research to Germany, not only because of the desire to return to Frankfurt but also because a committee at Columbia University had evaluated the work of the Institute and recommended that the Institute become a department of Paul Lazarsfeld’s Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia (Jäger, 2004, p. 149).  Marcuse, who had been producing propaganda for the OSS during the war based on his expert knowledge of Germany, published revolutionary theses in a journal in 1947, and these theses could not be reconciled with the direction of the Institute due to an apparent change in Horkheimer’s attitude towards Marxism. Thus, when excerpts from ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany.  In the late 1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951.  Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt.

In 1954 Adorno published an essay entitled “How to Look at Television” that was the result of a study that had been done for the Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others.  In this essay Adorno warned, “rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed of psychological control” (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160).  It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture.  At least one observer found it strange that “the leading cultural theorist of his day” did not take part in cultural developments of the fifties (Jäger, 2004, p. 191).  Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape his thought on the culture industry.  For example, in 1959 he wrote of a “universal pseudo-culture” in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on “The Culture Industry Reconsidered.”  In 1966, when writing the essay “Transparencies on Film,” Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

== One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of “The Culture Industry” ==

Adorno took over running the Institute in 1960, and his primary philosophical concern in the 1960s was his critical engagement with Martin Heidegger, especially Heidegger’s language, as detailed in the book ''The Jargon of Authenticity''.  In the meantime, Marcuse had developed a critique of Stalinism, and was developing a critique of social conditions in Western democracies, in part based on his familiarity with Adorno's work. He was, for example, connecting “the analysis and critique of false needs to a critical theory of mass media and popular culture” (Agger, 1995, p. 34).  Marcuse did not oppose popular culture as completely as Adorno, however, recognizing “fissures in the edifice of mainstream mass culture which could be pried open still further” (Agger, 1995, p. 34).  In ''One-Dimensional Man'' Marcuse put an analysis “of late capitalist society into a systematic context,” as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609).  Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse “social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society” (Reitz, 2000, p. 144).  Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a “system of repressive affluence” that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83).  The entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.   

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions (Marcuse, 1991, p. 8).  However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno had done.  In the end Marcuse’s analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideology.  Marcuse wrote, &quot;how can the administered individuals—who have made their mutilation into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scale—liberate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters?  How is it even thinkable that the vicious circle be broken?” (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book, it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist movements of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance.  In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist.  Like others associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated into practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 226).  

While Marcuse was writing a work that would become essential to student movements in the 1960s, in 1961 Adorno and Horkheimer resisted the reissue of ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' that had been proposed to them by the publishing house of Fischer. The publisher felt that the book could be read as a description of prevailing conditions in Germany.  Marcuse enthusiastically supported the reissue of the book in 1962, but Adorno and Horkheimer withheld their consent (Jäger, 2004, p. 194).   The reasons that Horkheimer and Adorno tried to keep ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' from reaching a wider audience are not entirely clear.  In reviewing the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollack reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the work required too much revision to receive mass dissemination.  The two authors continued to negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1969, and may have only agreed to republish the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals in the German student movement.  Students also began posting snippets of the text as handbills.  

While student movements in the United States and Germany looked to Herbert Marcuse as their idol, the situation in Frankfurt degenerated to the point at which Adorno could no longer effectively conduct classes.  He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were making teaching impossible.  In the winter term of 1968-69 students occupied a number of buildings at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research.  After the strike ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including one “tasteless demonstration” in which three females bared their breasts.  Adorno died a few months later (Jäger, 2004, p. 201-08).

== Critical Response to “The Culture Industry” ==

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the culture industry outside of a German context.  In the years since there have been numerous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113).  For the generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production, and failed to examine the culture industry’s economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).  

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, believing that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 46).  Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36).  Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s.  While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial societies between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 146-48).  Thus, for a some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

According to Hohendahl, for many postmodern critics the essay on the culture industry is problematic because they confuse the defense of modernist art with a defense of high culture, against popular culture.  In the context of ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' it is the destruction of traditional culture that is in question, along with its replacement with new forms depending on commodity exchange (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 137).  In relation to this Deborah Cook cites such artists as Schoenberg, Beckett, and Kafka as cultural producers who are not entirely subject to commodification, and notes that Jameson is in agreement that modernism is the “dialectical opposite of mass culture” (Cook, 1996, p. 107).  Thus for some critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant ideology.  As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends.  

The idea of the culture industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and hence, society.  Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry.  It is nonetheless the case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely on formulaic plots.  It is also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number of companies, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations operate.  As a broadcast medium, television is very much related to both radio and film, and shares with them qualities that situation it in the culture industry.  While there is a democratizing aspect to the Internet (in that anyone can create a web site), it happens that the commercial companies operating on the Internet continue to maintain an ideological function.  For example, one seldom sees new stories on MSNBC or Yahoo that would question the prerogatives of corporate America.  A reexamination of the idea of the culture industry may be necessary in order to theorize on how mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Communication Theory has one universal law, written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980. The Universal Communication Law states that, &quot;All living entities, beings and creatures communicate.&quot; In a an unpublished interview, Scudder clarified the concept - &quot;All of &quot;The Living&quot; communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, color transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge its presence. Examples - the cry of a child (communication that it is hungry, hurt, cold, etc.); the browning of a leaf (communication that it is dehydrated, thirsty per se, dying); the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.). Henceforth, Everything living communicates.&quot;

== Social Systems ==
When the second World War ended in Europe, seventeen-year-old Niklas Luhmann had been serving as an anti-aircraft auxiliary in the German army. He was briefly detained by the Americans. When asked in 1987 to describe this experience, he replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Before 1945, the hope was that after the defeat of the compulsory apparatus everything would be right by itself. Yet the first thing I experienced in American captivity was that my watch was taken off my arm and that I was beaten up. So it was not at all as I had thought it would be. Soon you could see that one could not compare political regimes according to a scheme of `good' versus `bad', but that you had to judge the figures according to a bounded reality. Of course I don't want to say that the time of the Nazi-regime and the time after 1945 are to be judged on equal terms. Yet I was simply disappointed in 1945. Yet is that really important? In any case the experience of the Nazi-regime for me has not been a moral one, but an experience of the arbitrary, of power, of the tactics to avoid the regime used by the man of the people. (Luhmann qtd. in Baecker, 2005)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The realization that human realities were subjective appears to have influenced the famous sociologist throughout the rest of his life. This chapter will introduce Luhmann and a few remarkable aspects of his theory.

=== Introduction ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The type of communication theory I am trying to advise therefore starts from the premise that communication is improbable, despite the fact that we experience and practice it every day of our lives and would not exist without it. This improbability of which we have become unaware must first be understood, and to do so requires what might be described as a contra-phenomenological effort, viewing communication not as a phenomenon but as a problem; thus, instead of looking for the most appropriate concept to cover the facts, we must first ask how communication is possible at all. (Luhmann 1990, p. 87)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The body of work produced by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann probably represents history’s most comprehensive attempt by one man to explain the whole of social existence. The above quotation hints at the essential nature of Luhmann’s thought – no “accepted wisdom” of the social science tradition could be left unexamined. Through more than 50 books and 400 articles, Luhmann applied his sociological systems theory to areas including law, science, religion, economics, politics, love, and art. Sociological systems have become one of the most popular theoretical models in contemporary German sociology, and are also widely applied in fields such as psychology, management science, and literary studies. A primary distinction of Luhmann’s social systems theory is that its focus of analysis is not individuals, groups, behaviors, or institutions, but the communication that occurs within systems. Dirk Baecker, a student of Luhmann’s explains that the systems theory “does away with the notion of system in all its traditional wording” and can carefully examine “every possible assumption of organism, mechanism, and information” – even, recursively, its own structure (Baecker 2001, p. 72). This realignment towards communication represents a significant break with social science tradition. Although Luhmann’s theory (or for that matter, most systems theories) do not lend themselves well to reduction, this chapter will attempt to present an overview of the subject.

=== Life in Brief ===
Niklas Luhmann was born in 1927. Following his teenage stint in the army, he went on to study law at the Universität Freiburg from 1946-1949 (Müller 2005). He trained as a lawyer, but found the intellectual constraints of practicing law not to his liking. He decided to go into public administration, as it promised him more freedom to pursue his own ideas (Hornung 1998). Luhmann became a civil servant for the town of Lüneburg in 1954. Although he enjoyed his work, he accepted the opportunity to take a sabbatical leave to study administrative science at Harvard University in 1960. Here Luhmann became a student of systems theorist Talcott Parsons, a thinker who would have a great impact on the development of Luhmann’s theories. After returning to Germany in 1961, Luhmann transferred to a research institute at the Hochschule für Verwaltungswissenschaften (School of Public Administration) in Speyer. Here he was afforded the freedom to pursue his scientific interests, and began his research of social structure. 

In 1965, Luhmann studied Sociology for a single semester at the Universität Münster. He was awarded a PhD and Habilitation (a postdoctoral qualification enabling one to teach at the university level) for two books previously published. After briefly occupying [[../The Frankfurt School|Theodor Adorno]]’s former chair at the Universität Frankfurt, (where he taught a poorly-attended seminar on the sociology of love), he accepted a position at the newly-founded Reformuniversität Bielefeld (Baecker, 2005). 

In 1973 he engaged in a debate with theorist [[w:Habermas|Jürgen Habermas]] about the role of social theory. This debate was later published as a series of essays in ''Theorie der Gesellschaft oder Sozialtechnologie: Was leistet die Systemforschung?'' (''Theory of Society or Social Technology: What can Systems Research Accomplish?'') (1973). The debate with Habermas (whose theory receives a much wider acceptance outside of Germany) served as the Anglophonic world’s major introduction to Luhmann’s thought.

Luhmann published profusely throughout his career, with each book and essay building a foundation for his final theory of society. He retired from this position in 1993, but continued to publish. His magnum opus, ''Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft'' (''The Society of the Society'') was published a year before his death in 1997.

=== Early Influences ===
By the end of the 19th century, industrialization had profoundly changed the Western world. Sociology had come into its own as a science: Karl Marx published profusely throughout the mid-1800s. [[w:Ferdinand Tonnies|Ferdinand Tönnies]] (1887) described social flows from Gemeinschaft (community, relationship oriented association) toward Gesellschaft (self interest oriented society) in 1887. Emile Durkheim (1893) explored the division of labor a few years later, and opened the first European sociology department in 1896. [[w:Max Weber|Max Weber]] developed new methodological approaches and also founded a sociology department by 1920. While these fathers of the discipline differed greatly in their research and philosophy of society, they all recognized that the function and dysfunction of society is linked to the function and dysfunction of different social components such as classes, institutions, technologies, or individuals. 

==== Durkheim’s Functionalism ====
Durkheim’s theory of functionalism, in particular, had a lasting impact upon the social sciences. Durkheim argued that “social facts” existed independent of individuals and institutions, and that these facts were the most productive subject for empirical sociological research. Social facts (such as suicide rates (Durkheim 1951), policies, or church attendance) can be measured, interpreted, and tested. Social theories derived from these analyses can then be used to explain social functioning.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The determination of function is . . . necessary for the complete explanation of the phenomena. . . .To explain a social fact it is not enough to show the cause on which it depends; we must also, at least in most cases, show its function in the establishment of social order.  (1950, p. 97)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Durkheim’s functionalism measured social effects within the context of a larger social environment. Durkheim’s 1893 book The Division of Labor in Society focused on labor division in an attempt to describe and explain social order. He elaborated on the manner in which increasing labor division affects the evolution of societies.

==== Parsonian Social Systems ====
Talcott Parsons, who would become America’s preeminent social theorist throughout the mid-20th century, drew on Durkheim’s functionalism in the development of his theory of social action. He was also able to integrate concepts from the burgeoning fields of general systems theory (von Bertalanffy, 1950; 1976), information theory (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949), and social cybernetics (Wiener, 1948; 1950). Whereas Durkheim was content to develop sociology as a discipline alongside the other social sciences, Parsons became the advocate of a “grand theory” that could subsume the other social sciences. Drawing heavily from Weber’s writings on action (which Parsons translated himself), Parsons’ functionalism was developed as a theory of action. Individuals were understood as acting of their own volition, influenced in their behavior by external forces. As a component of this larger theory, Parsons developed the theory of the social system. His “social system” is generally synonymous with the term “society” and emerges from the interaction of individuals (Parsons, 1951). For the purposes of this chapter only a few features of Parson’s theory can be discussed. These will include his conceptions of the functional imperatives of action and the notion of equilibrium.

===== Equilibrium =====
Parsons’ social equilibrium is the orderly, smoothly functioning society. It is the result of individuals' acting according to the norms and values that have been provided in their social environment (Parsons, 1951). Parsonian social systems tended towards equilibrium, because “the actions of the members of a society are to a significant degree oriented to a single integrated system of ultimate ends common to these members” (Parsons qtd. in Heyl, 1968). The understanding of equilibrium within different societies was the primary goal of social systems theory, and (as Parsons would have it) sociology as a whole.

===== Functional imperatives of action =====
Parsons’ functional imperatives of action were developed as a way to classify the goals that “action systems” (be it individuals, institutions, or groups) would pursue to reach equilibrium. His AGIL model (adaptation, goal-attainment, integration, latent pattern maintenance) remains one of his most famous formulations.

: '''A''' - The function of adaptation addresses the fact that resources in the environment are scarce, and the system must secure and distribute these resources. For social systems, social institutions are employed to meet these needs. The economy is generally identified as the primary institution that meets this need.
: '''G''' - The function of goal-attainment deals with the system’s desire to use resources to achieve specific situational ends. Political institutions generally fulfill this role for social systems. 
: '''I''' – Integration is the most complex and problematic of the functional imperatives. It addresses the need for a system to coordinate and regulate the various subunits within a system. Integration of social systems is often associated with laws and norms, and judicial institutions. 
: '''L''' – Finally, the function of pattern maintenance refers to a system’s ability to maintain its own stability, and consists of two distinct components. For social systems, the first component deals with the ability of the system to motivate normative behavior of actors. The second component is involved with the transmission of social values. This imperative might be institutionally satisfied by education and religion (Wallace &amp; Wolf, 1991).

The actions of an individual, for example, could then be compared to the actions of an institution within this framework. The social system, also subject to these imperatives, is in equilibrium because all of its constituent actors are morally impelled to perform socially-expected functions. As might be expected, Parsons’ early work was frequently criticized for failing to account for social change, the opposite of social equilibrium. Parsons eventually developed an evolutionary model of social change that described incremental adjustments occurring through slight disruptions of the social system’s equilibrium.

=== Luhmann and Social Systems ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sociology is stuck in a theory crisis. (Luhmann, 1995, p. xlv)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Luhmann criticized the sociology of his time as being irredeemably subjective and unable to usefully describe reality. “Action theory is reconstructed as structural theory, structural theory as linguistic theory, linguistic theory as textual theory, and textual theory as action theory” (Luhmann, 1995, p. xlvi). The acquisition of new knowledge, Luhmann argued, was derived from some recombination of the work of classical theorists. Social theory spiraled into higher and higher levels of complexity, each refocusing and realignment of classical theory laying the foundation for ever more complex theoretical iterations. Luhmann set his personal task as no less than the complete theoretical reconceptualization of the discipline within a wholly consistent framework.

Luhmann’s sociological systems theory makes only two fundamental assumptions: that reality exists, and that systems exist (Luhmann, 1995, p. 12). The theory contains a constructivist epistemology, as it claims that knowledge can only exist as a construction of human consciousness. Luhmann does not claim that there is no external reality, but that our knowledge of it will always be subject to the symbolic system we use to represent it. 

From these simple assumptions, Luhmann attempts to build a universal social theory: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Theory… claims neither to reflect the complete reality of its object, nor to exhaust all the possibilities of knowing its object. Therefore it does not demand exclusivity for its truth claims in relation to other, competing endeavors. But it does claim universality for its grasp of its object in the sense that it deals with everything social and not just sections. (Luhmann, 1995, p. xlv)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theory is universal because it seeks to describe and explain itself, along with all other social phenomena. The theory is self-referential.

Luhmann proceeds to clarify three fundamental differences between his theory and previous social theories. First, his theory is universal and can be applied to all social phenomena. Second, his theory is self-referential, and capable of examining itself in its own terms. Third, his theory is both complex and abstract enough to accomplish the previous two goals (Luhmann, 1995, xlviii).

There is no default entry point to Luhmann’s sociological systems theory. The structure of the theory is systemic. This means that the integration of its components is not linear and additive, but circular. The components of the theory do not build upon each other but produce each other. This introduction will attempt to show some of Luhmann’s most innovative developments, including his break from previous social systems theory.

==== A theory of communication ====
Luhmann found Parsons’ systems approach inspiring, but noticed several inconsistencies and problems. Stichweh (2000), a student of Luhmann’s, explains that there are two major strands of reasoning that led Luhmann to base his theory on communication rather than action. The first issue was that the actions of psychic systems (minds) and of social systems is difficult to distinguish using action theory. The interaction of the actor and his environment can only be described when the actor and environment are placed on the same analytic level. In Luhmann’s theory, the social system emerges from the communication between psychic systems (minds), and cannot be understood as a separate system “acting” on the individual. The second issue is that action theory cannot differentiate between action and experience. Selection (one of the components of Luhmann’s definition of communication, to be outlined below) can be viewed as either an action on the part of the selecting system, or as information about the state of the selecting system’s environment. The classification of information, Luhmann reasons, is not causally related to actors, and should be classified as experience, not action.

==== Individuals and the social system ====
One aspect of Luhmann’s theory that is significantly different from most social theories is that the human individual is not seen as focal to understanding society. In fact, Luhmann’s theory states unequivocally that the individual is not a constituent part of society. This counterintuitive claim begins to make sense if one recalls that Luhmann’s basic social element is communication. An individual is only relevant to society to the extent that they communicate. Whatever does not communicate within the society – such as biological and psychic systems – is not a part of the society. Psychic systems, or individual minds, can think but cannot communicate. In the social systems view, individuals are only loci for social communication.

==== Autopoietic systems ====
We will return to the issue of the individual within the social system after further discussion of Luhmann’s notion of “system”.  A system is emergent, in that it comes into existence as soon as a border can be drawn between a set of communications and the context of the communication, or the systems environment. A system is always less complex than its environment – if a system does not reduce the complexity in its environment, then it cannot perform any function. A system effectively defines itself by creating and maintaining a border between itself and the environment. In the case of biological systems, this concept of systemic self-generation was first identified and examined by Maturana and Varela (1980). They termed the self-generation of biological systems “autopoietic”. Luhmann believed that autopoiesis could be usefully applied to social systems as well. Luhmann’s autopoietic systems do more than just define their own borders. They also produce their own components and organizational structures. The major benefit of the autopoietic perspective on social systems is that it presents them without ambiguity, and not as something that can be reduced to anything other than itself, such as “consciousness” or a sum of actions (Anderson, 2003). Returning to the issue of the individual, it is again possible to see why individuals cannot be components of social systems – social systems are comprised of communications and therefore produce communications, not people (“Niklas Luhmann,” 2005).

==== Communication as selection ====
Another Luhmannian conception that might seem counterintuitive is his subjectless, actionless definition of communication. “Communication is coordinated selectivity. It comes about only if ego fixes his own state on the basis of uttered information” (Luhmann, 1995, p. 154). Luhmann criticizes the “transmission” metaphor of communication because “it implies too much ontology” and that “the entire metaphor or possessing, having, giving, and receiving” is unsuitable (1995, p. 139). For Luhmann, communication is not an “action” performed by an “actor” but a selection performed by a system. This &quot;selection&quot; that results in communication is more similar to Darwin’s “natural selection” than to the everyday usage of the term.  A social system generates communication much as a natural environment generates biological traits.

The selection process that Luhmann terms communication is actually a synthesis of three separate selections: the selection of information, the selection of a form, and the selection of an understanding (Anderson, 2003). Following Shannon and Weaver’s (1949) theory of information, Luhmann identifies information as a selection from a “repertoire of possibilities” (1995, p.140). The form of a communication is how the message is communicated. The selection of understanding refers to what should be understood about the message. A critical note here is that understanding does not refer to the message’s reception by a psychic system, but rather the linkage of the message to subsequent communications (Anderson, 2003). The result of this selection process is the creation of meaning, which is the medium of communication in social systems (Luhmann, 1995, p. 140). 

Social (and psychic) systems construct and sustain themselves in this way through communication. Communications can only exist as a product of social (and psychic) systems. Society is then a self-descriptive system that contains its own description. Luhmann recognizes that this definition is recursive and antithetical to classical scientific theory (“Soziologische Systemtheorie”, 2005).

=== Contemporary research ===
A variety of scholars today employ sociological systems analysis in fields ranging from law to literary theory. The theory is one of the most popular in German sociology, and has a significant following in continental Europe, Japan, and elsewhere (“Soziologische Systemtheorie,” 2005). Many of Luhmann’s former students and colleagues, such as Dirk Baecker, Peter Fuchs, Armin Nassehi, and Rudolf Stichweh, continue to develop the theory.

=== Conclusion ===
The preceding can only serve as the briefest of introductions to an enormous body of original thought. A lifetime’s work of thousands of pages of published text cannot be condensed into a few thousand words. This chapter has attempted to trace some of the major theoretical threads which led to the development of Luhmann’s universal theory of sociological systems. It presents some of Luhmann’s most engaging and innovative conceptual formulations. Because Luhmann’s theory represents a major break from the classical social sciences in structure and content, its comprehension requires a significant investment of intellectual effort. This effort is worthwhile, as Luhmann’s meticulous theoretical paradigm provides a useful alternative to other social science traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rebcode is a dialect for creating very high performance code which can be useful for heavy computations and for creating algorithms.

In essence, Rebcode is an assembly language within REBOL. Rebcode should only be used when it's necessary, since it's based on performance, not ease of use, and is tedious to work with for longer scripts.

Also since Rebcode is designed for performance, it does not check for mistakes, and '''mistakes in Rebcode can crash REBOL''', just like any other assembly language.

Rebcode is currently pre-alpha and is not finished. This section of the book will not be completed until we have a stable version of Rebcode which won't change too much or the release of a public release or late beta.

&quot;MetaClasses&quot; is nonstandard capitalization. It's one word and should have no special caps; just &quot;metaclasses&quot; (but &quot;Metaclasses&quot; since it's part of a title).

      <comment>/* Vocabulary and grammar */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Persian/top}}

Welcome to the English Wikibook for learning the Persian Language.

This course requires no prior knowledge of Persian.  It aims to teach grammar, vocabulary, common phrases, conversational language, and formal/literary Persian.  By the end, you should be able to read and write Persian but will probably need a human teacher to help with listening and speaking.  The book is meant to be read starting with lesson 1 and moving forward.  It will move slowly.

== The Persian Language ==
Persian (local names: ''Parsi'', ''Farsi'' or ''Dari'') is an Indo-European language, the dominant language of the Indo-Iranian language family and is a major language of antiquity. After the 7th century Persian absorbed a great deal of Arabic vocabulary. Persian is the official language of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. Persian is also a popular language in academia and business. Related languages include Pashto, Kurdish, Ossetian, and Balochi. Urdu and Turkish also have a sizable vocabulary from Persian.

[[Image:Iranische Sprachen.jpg|400px|right|the distribution of Iranian languages]]

== Persian or Farsi? ==
''Farsi'' is an Arabized form of the word ''Parsi'', one of the original names in Persian for the Persian language. Since there is no [p] sound in Arabic, ''Parsi'' became ''Farsi'' after the Arab conquest of Persia. ''Farsi'' then became the local name of Persian, but English speakers still call the language “Persian”, just as they say “German”, “Spanish”, and “Chinese” for languages locally called ''Deutsch'', ''español'', and ''Hanyu''.  There is considerable opposition to calling Persian ''Farsi'' in English and other languages, as is summarized by the following pronouncement on the English name of Persian language by the ''Academy of Persian language and literature'':
# “Persian” has been used in a variety of publications including cultural, scientific and diplomatic documents for centuries and, therefore, it carries a very significant historical and cultural meaning. Hence, changing “Persian” to “Farsi” would negate this established important precedent.
# Changing the usage from “Persian” to “Farsi” may give the impression that “Farsi” is a new language, although this may well be the intention of some users of “Farsi”.
# Changing the usage may also give the impression that “Farsi” is a dialect used in some parts of Iran rather than the predominant (and official) language of the country.
# The word “Farsi” has never been used in any research paper or university document in any Western language, and the proposal to begin using it would create doubt and ambiguity about the name of the official language of Iran.

== Persian and English ==
Since Persian and English are both Indo-European languages, many basic Persian words are familiar to English speakers. For example {{term-fa|مادر|mâdar|mother}}, {{term-fa|پدر|pedar|father}}, and {{term-fa|برادر|barâdar|brother}}.

== Pronunciation ==
Although Persian was influenced by Arabic, English speakers should not find it too difficult to pronounce Persian letters fairly well. Fortunately for English speakers, the [[w:Glottal stop|glottal stop]] &lt;big&gt;[[w:Hamza|ء]]&lt;/big&gt; [ʔ] from Arabic is barely pronounced in Persian, and the “emphatic” consonants in Arabic (&lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ط#Arabic|ط]] [[wikt:ض#Arabic|ض]] [[wikt:ص#Arabic|ص]] [[wikt:ظ‎#Arabic|ظ‎]] [[wikt:ح‎#Arabic|ح‎]] [[wikt:ع#Arabic|ع]]&lt;/big&gt;) are pronounced without the [[w:Pharyngealization|pharyngealization]], making them much easier for most native English speakers.

It is important to listen to Persian often and to try to use the language. Pronunciation guides can only closely convey the sounds of Persian but are never totally exact, so pronunciation benefits greatly from listening to native speakers.

== Transcription ==
There are several systems of transcription to represent the sounds of Persian in the [[w:Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]].  This book uses the [[w:Perso-Latin_Alphabet#UniPers|UniPers (also called ''Pârsiye Jahâni'', &quot;Universal Persian&quot;)]] transcription system, which uses the basic Latin alphabet plus a few modified letters (‹â›, ‹š›, ‹ž›, and an apostrophe ‹’›) as a standard phonemic script that is clear, simple, and consistent. Each transcription is enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., ‹fârsi›:
{{Persian/Transcription key}}

== Vocabulary and grammar ==
In learning to read or speak any language, the two aspects to be mastered are vocabulary and grammar. Acquiring vocabulary is a matter of memorization. Children learn thousands of words of their native language by the time they are conscious of the learning process, so it is easy to underestimate importance of having a large vocabulary. This process can be reactivated by immersion: moving to where the language is spoken and one’s native tongue cannot be used for daily communication.

Without the opportunity to move to a Persian-speaking area, a student must make a substantial effort to learn the meaning, pronunciation, and proper use of words. Be sure to learn all of the vocabulary words in each lesson. Early lessons have simple sentences because the student’s vocabulary is presumably limited, but more complex sentences in later lessons demonstrate more typical Persian. It may be helpful to translate these using a Persian-English dictionary.  Access to a print dictionary is very helpful. Other sources of Persian, such as newspapers, magazines, and web sites can help to build vocabulary and to develop a sense of how Persian sentences are put together.

== Resources ==
The Internet has a wide variety of study resources. You can refer to the appendix of this book for a selection of some of the best sources:

* [[Persian/Websites|Websites]] 
* [[wikt:Category:Persian language|Persian - English Wiktionary]]

Also, each new vocabulary term introduced in this course can be looked up easily in the English Wiktionary wherever the dictionary image [[Image:Wiktionary-logo wpstyle-en with transparency.png|32px|link=wikt:فارسی#Persian|Look up فارسی in Wiktionary]] appears.   Click on the image to look up a Persian word wherever you see a link like the following:

      <comment>/* Merge with previous page */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In my opinion most of this chapter could be deleted because the basic rotation/location/scaling operations have been explained before already. What new in this chapter is the ''Putting it on'' (i.e. making parent) and the ''adding color'' (which doesn't belong in this chapter though)

Why doesn't my text show up on the discussion page? :-?

== &quot;Putting it on&quot; section no longer accurate? ==

Under version 2.37a (still a problem with 2.42a too), the model is already created as one object; it appears to be impossible to select just one group, such as the hat or the head, in object mode.

Solution: 
i) While in EDIT MODE select all the vertices for the Hat then press the PKEY. In Seperate menu simply select &quot;selected&quot;. The Hat and the Man will now be seperate objects.
ii) With the hat still selected press f9 and in the mesh pannel click on center new, this will give the hat its own center point.

Alternative solution:
Before creating the hat, deselect the man by pressing AKEY.  Then create the hat as normal.

== Pictures? ==

It could be useful getting some pictures in this area. It gives a good guide for what to work towards. Without images some of the things don't quite workas explained and arn't as easy to correct without it.

== Confusing ==
The tutorial up until now was really clear and easy to follow. This chapter sort of hit me like a brick wall. I have the man's body, his head, and his hat. How do I attach his head to his body first? I don't want his head to act like his hat (able to move separately from his body).
:Is it possible that you added the head while you were in object mode rather than edit mode? If this is the case I don't know how you would 'combine' the objects (head and body) but if I find a way I will come back and post here.

== Color the hat? ==
Tried to follow the same steps to color the hat but couldnt get the same material options to come up...is coloring the hat beyond the scope of the tutorial at this point?

== Selection -&gt; Center as way to move object center (pink dot) ==
This method doesn't seem to work for me the way it is implied. &quot;Or you could hit SHIFT+SKEY, select Selection → Center. &quot; From the text I got the understanding that this would move the dot to the cursor, but this function doesn't seem to do that. Maybe it's just me but if this is supposed to facilitate moving the object's center I think it needs to be reworded.

== Merge with previous page ==

Hi guys, I think the content required for this page is just too little to merit it's existence. I propose we merge it with ''Creating A Simple Hat'', the previous module.

== Notes and questions ==

Wikijunior books would like to introduce a free children's book from all the writers at Wikibooks. &quot;The Solar System&quot; is a fabulous place for children to learn about - and why buy a book about it in a store, when you can get all the facts and pictures from the experts and writers at wiki?

Let's not bash the comercial distributer who might copy this text. The discount versions provided directly to children might says something like: This printing of the wikibook has been provided at a reduced cost by the Beck Foundation. or This printing of the wikibook has been provided at a reduced cost by a group of really bad people to draw children into a life of crime. It should be something the printer puts in.

Wikibooks is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, aimed at providing quality reading for adults and children minus the cost or trouble of going and getting books from a library or store. 

Getting it at a store or library may be the easiest way to get the book.

The people here at all the wiki projects are here because they want to advance the cause of learning, and increase the global spread of knowledge. Nobody was paid to write this book's manuscript, and no single person tries to lay claim to its pages or what they contain. When the first launched into cyberspace as a full, finished version it will be independent of a publishing corporation, independent of a printer, and free from all that is part of normal book making.

There are many discussions about the use of free vs. open source. Free might imply you don't have to pay for the printed copy. --[[User:Gbleem|Gbleem]] 17:41, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

== provider introduction ==

There should probably be a separate printer/distributer introduction. I'm sure any printer or distributer will add their own. They would probably leave in the wikibook introduction if it limits it's scope.

== Questions, comments about the text ==

'''Capitalisation of the Sun.''' The Sun should be capitalised. A sun should not. &quot;Sun&quot; is a proper noun when used as the name of this solar system's star. Same goes for the Moon vs a moon. [[User:203.22.236.14|203.22.236.14]] 14:07, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

:I would have to concurr on this point.  I've tried to use the capitalized version throughout this whole Wikibook as it is a proper noun, and one solution to this by Science Fiction writers is to use the Latinized version of these celestial bodies like Sol and Luna instead.  I am not advocating this approach, as I consider &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Moon&quot; to be proper names for these object, and ones that kids should be familar with if they speak English.  However, if you are refering to &quot;the moons of Mars&quot;, moon is in lowercase.  This makes a spellchecker something that causes heartburn on projects like this, but it is something that perhaps we need to deal with and check.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:09, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

== Pluto and Dwarf Planets? ==

'''Pluto.''' I removed references to pluto as a planet in the introduction. Should this be done throughout the text? Should there be a separate category for dwarf planets? Should I have discussed it before making such a change? I'm new to this.--[[User:Mcgill|Mcgill]] 04 September 2006

Pluto and Dwarf Planets are something that should be mentioned, in my opinion. In the line about planets, it says there are many types, including rocky and gas. What about dwarf? [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 05:33, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

==Edit of Introduction Page==

I rewrote the measurement section to be as clear and as brief as possible, ensuring that this section is accessible and not off-putting to young readers who need the information. I also took out the section &quot;What is in the night sky?&quot; as I felt it was repeating much of what is said in the Solar System module. I replaced it with some discussion on how scientists study the solar system, which covers how we know what we know. I don't think this is covered in the rest of the book and it is appropriately introductory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Regionalisation ==

In International Relations regionalisation (or regionalism) is actually the set of processes that lead states to work together in an international system on a regional scale. From the realist perspective of International Relations it is actually an outward expansion from the nation state.

Behind the process of regionalisation lies the concept of regionalism. This can be seen as the normative aspects, or values, that underly regionalisation e.g. the (contested) European identity. However, it is also a theoretical tool for analysis of international relations. For example the concept of security regime in regional security would not be possible without the analytic tool of 'regionalism'.

= Theories of International Relations =
== Introduction ==

In actual fact, the commonly used term/title &quot;Theories of International Relations&quot; is somewhat of a misnomer because in practice, most books or articles on this topic do not present theories OF international relations, but theories IN/WITHIN international relations (insofar as international relations is an identifiable field of inquiry). The heading theories OF international relations might be more appropriate in epistemological discussions where the object of inquiry would be theories about the field of international relations, rather than disparate theories that are within the field and focus on different aspects of the international relations world.

== Realism ==

Realism is the traditional school of international relations theory. It developed as a method of analysis of international relations when political actors consisted almost exclusively of '''states'''. Thus, it is a state-centred view of international relations and discounts the importance of other actors such as international organisations, Non-Government Organisations (NGOs), terrorist organisations, etc. It is assumed that all states act for their own interest, and that all states, in a given situation, will act the same way.

=== Survival, Territorial Integrity, Population ===

It has been posited that a state requires three main elements to survive. The top three priorities for a state (the &quot;national self-interest&quot;) have been posited to be survival, territorial integrity, and population, in that order:
*'''Survival''' its existence as a state, with sovereign boundaries, administration, and control within its boundaries (threat of force).
*'''Territorial Integrity''' considered breached if another state launches an invasion; a breach of territorial integrity does not necessarily mean that a state is defeated (for example, the invaded state may choose to launch a counter-attack), but rather, may sometimes be compromised to ensure a state's survival
*'''Population''' can sometimes be compromised (e.g. conscription in the army)

== Critical Theory ==
== Marxist International Theory ==

== Green Theory ==
Green Theory in International Relations:  Sustainable Environment

==Dramaturgical Theory==
Dramaturgical theory is based heavily on Erving Goffman's sociological work, especially his description of impression management. Nations and other international actors are treated as trying not only to advance their own interests in the short-term, but create long-lasting impressions of their cultures, habits, etc. that foreigners (and possibly their own citizens) will take as true.
Gregory Adams did the most work in developing it.

== Feminist Theory ==
Feminist theory in international relations considers the effects of male domination in international relations and its related fields.

== The Clash of Civilisations Thesis ==
The Clash of Civilizations thesis is a theory developed by Samuel P. Huntington to explain conflict in the post-cold war world. Huntington predicted that post cold war conflict would take place between civilizations defined along broad ethnic and religious lines. The civilizations he predicted were the Western, orthodox, Islamic, African, Latin American, Sinic, Buddhist, Hindu and Japanese.

Are you sure it's a good idea to write this chapter before the previous ones? As it is, we will have to (and already are) making assumptions about what will be taught in 
them. IMO we should write the chapters in order. Anybody have comments? [[User:Eric119|Eric119]] 17:24 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)

: Well, when I have time, I'll go fill in the others. The stuff on differentiation requires nice pictures and demonstrative examples, which will take a lot of time to fix and prepare, whilst integration is more a symbolic thing and ''most'' of it can be written without having diagrams and such (but they will be needed later)

== Fundamental Theorem of Calculus ==

Perhaps I missed it (completely possible as I'm a bit of a Wiki newbie) but I didn't see mention of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC).
IMHO, the FTC is one of the most &quot;surprising results&quot; in mathematics.
First, I think that integration is not really about finding anti-derivatives, though certainly it involves using them.
Integration is about infinite sums (of areas).
Second, the surprising thing is that if we look at a function (f) between A and B, find the anti-derivitive of f (F), then take Fs value at B and subtract Fs value at A then that gives us (drum roll please) the exact area under the curve (f) between A and B!
How???
Of course, there is a good reason but the FTC was, and I think still is, a rather surprising thing to discover.

Okay, this is starting to look like a rant... sorry.  Wistful recolleciton of my days teaching college Calculus, I suppose.  Anyway, please let me know if I simply missed it somewhere -- maybe it's planned but not written or something like that.  Thanks.

== Exception ==

It should be explicitly noted, although it is implied by the (alpha + 1) factor in the denominator, that the power rule for integration does not hold for alpha = -1.

Welcome to another Wikibook. As you most likely know, Wikibooks are a division of the Wikimedia foundation (a free open-source media project), and they are generated, edited, proofed, and read by online contributors, fans, and scholars. Each book is a labor of love on the part of its many creators because no contributor is paid for their works and no person is held in higher regard than his peers. All wiki products are made for the advancement of knowledge and the spread of intellect. They are free to every person who can access them. Every book is edited to perfection by all the thousands of volunteers who process the ideas contained within them. Now we, the creators, wish to invite you inside this wikibook and to learn about the written word.

Where would we be without the classical science that has evolved to be language and writing? Would we be bone-toting barbarians living in caves and wearing furs?  Would we be using sign language?  What would we do without the words that are written within this book? The written word has created and destroyed life, instigated wars and the sought peace after, the word has been the epoch of love and the credulity of hate, and the written word has shaped the age we now live in. What happened to create the alphabets of today, and what place will our words take us tomorrow? If you wish to read more, just &quot;open&quot;[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Written_Word:Contents] this wikibook.

==Writer's Manual==
Thanks for your interest in contributing to this wikibook, this manuscript is in desperate need of additional content. Please add all content and pictures you can. Thank you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What Is A Word==

The Written Word is the basic building block of knowledge. It allows a way to leave information behind, to be read years or decades later. The way you use them, and how effectively, determines how the information is received.
Consider this: when we have a math teacher who stands at the front of a classroom and talks in a monotone voice, with absolutely no expression, boredom will ensue, no matter how interested a student is. Compare this to a teacher who is enthusiastic, who explains things in an uptone style, and students will have a difficult time not becoming interested.
This is commonly the difference between good and bad writing. This isn't just limited to novels, but to every kind of text. While novels are the ones who most commonly use vivid descriptions and nuances in the writing, it should be noted that the same techniques can be used elsewhere.

==Word Theory==

According to Wiktionary, a word[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/word] is a distinct unit of language with a particular meaning 

In the classical Roman form of writing, each word is formed by a series of characters. The Roman classical alphabet is as follows:

{| style=&quot;width:400px; height:25px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|- 
| a,A
| b,B
| c,C
| d,D
| e,E 
| f,F
| g,G
| h,H
| i,I
| j,J
| k,K
| l,L
| m,M
| n,N
| o,O
| p,P
| q,Q
| r,R
| s,S
| t,T
| u,U
| v,V
| w,W
| x,X
| y,Y
| z,Z
|}
Each character is designed to make a specific sound when pronounced. And when the sounds are placed together they make the noises that the human brain translates as &quot;words&quot;. Specific groupings of characters can be placed together to form sounds, that without the grouping, would take too many characters and would be tedious to write. Letters make sounds according to the others that surround them in words. For example, the letters &quot;c&quot; and &quot;h&quot; when placed together make the sound &quot;cha&quot; but spelling is still just &quot;ch&quot;. 

Writing and Speaking are opposites, but they are opposites that attract. Most people that write also know how to speak and vice versa, but take one skill away and the other will quickly deteriorate. People who cannot write rarely speak well, and people who cannot speak (not counting a prohibitive disease) are rarely good writers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The First Word==

The first organized alphabet of characters is believed to be mesopotamian Cuneiform. *Still working*

It is also to be considered that in the region of the Shinnar plain
about three thousand BC and maybe even earlier, that beer drinkers were partly to blame for the formation of the first notation on clay tablets. 
Labouring in the fields growing corn and barley along with hops they were given a daily beer allowance by the landowners. Usually among drinkers of alcoholic beverages their ability to count becomes somewhat blurred so they would place several marks on these tablets according to the amount to which each was entitled.
These markings lead directly to the aforementioned cunieform.

'''Raw sugar''' is the sugar which results from removing molasses from sugar cane, before further refinement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why Wikibooks and not Wikipedia ==

This is a quick note as to why I'm keeping this page even though all of the links go to Wikipedia.

Earlier I deleted all of the &quot;sub pages&quot; to this Wikibook module because it was largely duplication of previous work on Wikipedia and mainly encyclopedic articles that were poorly named as well.  I'm keeping this particular module (renamed, however) because I feel that this table is indeed something that can be kept in a simple form and not subject to the whims of Wikipedia editors unrelated to the [[General Chemistry]] Wikibook.  This also give more freedom for the authors of that Wikibook a chance to incorporate this Wikibook module more closely into the contents of that book, and even do modifications that make sense only within that book.

A &quot;generic Peroidic Table&quot; within Wikibooks is inappropriate as Wikipedia already does a pretty good job as it is.  This is a book-specific table and should be treated as such.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:01, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

== Name Change ==

You are absolutely right, this should be a simple Periodic table for the general chemistry book.  I changed the name to reflect that this is part of the General Chemistry book. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Julians|Julians]] ([[User talk:Julians|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Julians|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

== Removal of &quot;History&quot; section ==

While I'm not against adding a history section here, what was added is in clear violation of copyright and can be found here instead:

http://www.wou.edu/las/physci/ch412/perhist.htm

That is clearly copyrighted material and needs to be removed completely from this article.  Any attempt to add it back will be deleted immediately because we simply can't have that on Wikibooks.  If you want to paraphrase it and do some scholarly research to elaborate on those ideas, but make it something original, you are welcome to do so.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:27, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== Nonmetals ==

Although I like your coloring scheme, I believe it misleads students into thinking that the halogens are not nonmetals. Is there another way of assigning all the nonmetals the same color while still defining which are halogens and noble gases?

We don't need to do that.&lt;br /&gt;
We can just change &quot;Nonmetals&quot; to &quot;Other Nonmetals,&quot; and also put something saying that the nonmetals not colored in the color are &quot;Halogens,&quot; and &quot;Noble gases&quot;.
== Germanium ==

Germanium is always considered as a metalloid. Here I put it as a metal.&lt;br /&gt;
Can someone change it to a metalloid.&lt;br /&gt;
And then I will put a citation saying why I put polonium as a metal.&lt;br /&gt;
Please also do that for the [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table/Print]] article.&lt;br /&gt;

== Lawrencium atomic weight change from [263] to [262], [262] is the most commonly stated atomic weight for Lr ==

As with No on the [[/Print]] version, on this and that I want Lr to be changed from [263] to [262], to not confuse most people.</text>

It does not include the full details of CPR, which are included in the [[First Aid/Primary Assessment &amp; Basic Life Support|wikibook proper]].

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;}}

==Area - check the area==
Look for hazards. Hazards include split electrical wires, fire, unstable building structure or anything else that could present a risk to the responder. If there are hazards, remove them, or remove the victim from them if possible. If not, then retreat to a safe distance, call EMS and wait for their arrival. Make sure that you do not put yourself in danger. If you are near a road, ensure that you are clearly visible to traffic.

'''Put on gloves''' if you have them and use a '''Pocket Mask''' or '''Face Shield''' if you have access to them and need to give rescue breaths.

==Awake - check level of consciousness==
''Does the victim respond to voice?''

'''If YES''', check the victim for other conditions and call for help if necessary.

'''If NO''', call Call for help and start doing CPR until help arrives

==Ambulance - call EMS==
Call EMS using a bystander if possible. If you're alone, and the victim is an adult (&gt;8 years old), then leave the victim to call EMS yourself. If you're alone but the victim is a child (1-8 years old) or an infant (&lt;1 year old), then continue; you'll call EMS later.

Obtain an AED and AED-trained responder if possible. If no AED-trained responder is available and an AED is available, obtain it and follow the voice prompts given by the AED and instructional pictures. 

==Breathing - check for breathing==
Quickly remove any loose and obvious obstructions from the mouth. Check the victim for signs of obvious breathing, such as clear signs of chest rise and fall. Breathing must be regular, consistent and obvious. 

Gasping, irregular, infrequent or extremely shallow breathing should not be considered normal breathing. The victim's brain may attempt to cause breaths when the heart has stopped. If the breathing is not adequate, or you are unsure, continue CPR with compressions.

''Is the victim breathing?''

'''If YES''', place the victim in the Recovery position and call for help unless a spinal injury is suspected in which it is crucial to '''not move the patient'''.  If the patient vomits, however, it is more important to roll them over to their side while holding the back, neck, and head stable.

'''If NO''', give 30 chest compressions, then 2 rescue breaths. 

==Compressions - begin compressions==
[[Image:CPR.jpg|thumb|Correct position for CPR. The arms are fully extended and the thrusts are given from the hips.]]

*Hand/finger placement on the center of the chest, on the lower half of the breastbone. Be sure to not compress the soft are of the abdomen before the breastbone.
*After 5 cycles (approx. 2 minutes) call EMS if you haven't done so already (in the case of children or infants). If a bystander is available, get them to call immediately upon arrival. If they have to leave the area to contact EMS, tell the bystander to return to you and inform you of the ETA of the EMS.
*Compress at the rate of at least 100 per minute.
*Push at least 2&quot; (5 cm) on adults; at least 1/3rd of the chest depth for pediatric victims.
*Use two hands for adult compressions, one or two hands for children, and two fingers for infant compressions.

==Airway - open the airway==
Place one hand on the forehead and two fingers on the chin. Tilt the head back and lift the chin so the victim's jawline is perpendicular to the ground

==Breathing - give breaths==
Place a CPR shield over the victim's mouth, if available. With the head tilted back as described in &quot;Airway&quot;, pinch the victim's nose shut with the hand that in on their forehead. Place your mouth over their mouth, making a complete seal. Give a normal breath until you see chest rise. Give a second breath, then immediately go back to compressions.

Do not stop CPR to recheck for signs of life. Signs of life tend to be very dramatic and movement will be observed if the victim no longer requires CPR. Continue CPR until emergency help takes over, the victim moves, you are too exhausted to continue or the area becomes unsafe. If an AED and AED-trained responder arrives on the scene, it will have priority on the over CPR. Continue CPR until the AED operator asks you to stop.

== This summary is terrible ==

I just updated the full CPR section to reflect reality and sanity. Please change this summary so it corresponds to CPR and not someone's invention. All in all its not as bad as the full article, but its seriously out of date ie there is no circulation check, and there hasn't been for several '''years'''! [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 14:27, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
:Done! [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 19:27, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

Circulation assessments are going by the way side now.  It has been realised that most lay people can't accurately detect a pulse under pressure.  So now the recommendation is - No Breathing do CPR.

Thanks Chris Hodson
:Yes, that was updated some time ago. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:17, 14 March 2009 (UTC)

What does &quot;30-2&quot; indicate in the CPR chart? Thirty compressions to every two breaths? This can't seem right if there's 100 compressions per minute but twenty to thirty breaths in the same time (going off the &quot;breath every 2-3 seconds&quot; note). Can someone make it a little clearer? - [[Special:Contributions/124.168.114.17|124.168.114.17]] ([[User talk:124.168.114.17|talk]]) 15:05, 16 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">To begin programming in Visual Basic .NET, you can either compile directly from the command line with the .NET [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9B3A2CA6-3647-4070-9F41-A333C6B9181D&amp;displaylang=en SDK], use [http://msdn.microsoft.com/howtobuy/vstudio/ Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE], or the open-source [http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Download/ SharpDevelop IDE].

In this manual, however, we will only be covering Microsoft's official IDE.  Programming a form (window) by hand can be challenging if you are not familiar with the language, so starting with a good form designer will help a lot.

Okay, it's now time for your first program!

== Application Windows Forms ==
Start up a Visual Basic .NET IDE and create a windows application.

Double click on the form to open up the code view.  You should see something similar to:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Public Class Form1
    Inherits System.Windows.Forms.Form

[Windows Form Designer generated code]

    Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load

    End Sub
End Class
&lt;/source&gt;


Enter in the following code in the Form_Load Sub (between the &quot;Private Sub&quot; line and the &quot;End Sub&quot; line):

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 MessageBox.Show(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

This creates your classic &quot;Hello World!&quot; program.

Press F5 or go to the Debug menu and select Start to start the program. You should see an alert box that says &quot;Hello World!&quot; and then the main window (with nothing on it) should open. Click the &quot;X&quot; in the title bar like you would to quit any program!


== Application console ==
Add a new project via the menu ''File'', then ''New'', ''Project...'' and select ''Application console''.

Paste in the ''Main()'' function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
 Console.ReadLine()
&lt;/source&gt;

Now to avoid the program to automatically launch the previous paragraph form instead of the console, right click on the new ''ConsoleApplication1'' from the ''Solutions explorer'', and ''Set as starting project''.

Then the console appears when pressing F5.

== Basic symbols ==
As Visual Basic, VB.net uses:
# ' before comments
# _ to split a command on the next line
# : to start a new command on the same line

      <text xml:space="preserve">__FORCETOC__

== Introduction ==
Visual Basic .NET is one of the two flagship languages (with C#) for the .NET framework from Microsoft. Despite being called Visual Basic, it is actually '''not''' backwards-compatible with VB6, and any code written in the old version will not compile under VB.NET.

As a language, Visual Basic.NET has the following traits:

'''Object-Oriented'''

As with all .NET languages, VB.NET includes full-blown support for object-oriented concepts, including simple inheritance. Everything in VB.NET is an object, including all of the primitives (Short, Integer, Long, String, Boolean, etc.) as well as types, events, and even assemblies. Everything inherits from the Object base class.

'''Event-Driven'''

All previous versions of Visual Basic were event-driven, but this feature is heavily enhanced under the .NET framework. Events are no longer recognized because they use a certain naming convention (ObjectName_EventName), but now are declared with a Handles ObjectName.EventName clause.  Event handlers can also be declared at runtime using the AddHandler command.

'''.NET Framework'''

As the name implies, VB.NET runs on top of Microsoft's .NET framework, meaning the language has full access to all of the supporting classes in the framework. It's also possible to run VB.NET programs on top of Mono, the open-source alternative to .NET, not only under Windows, but even Linux or Mac OSX.

'''Additional Features'''

As of version 10.0, VB.NET supports generics, anonymous classes, lambda functions, anonymous types, and other great features that make it a great language to learn and use.

==Getting Started==

'''Using Windows'''

If you do not have the full version of Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft provides free tools to create .NET applications using [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express| Visual Basic Express].  

'''Using Linux, Mac OSX'''

You can use [http://www.monodevelop.com MonoDevelop] with Linux, Mac OS, or Windows. Despite being limited in its support for all of the features of the language, it allows for cross platform development.

&lt;!--'''Contributors, please read!'''     

If you wish to add a school, please do as follows: (I personally prefer that you log in first, but that is not required.) We can't force you to follow this procedure, but it will help keep listings in consistent form. 

Step 1:  Go to the Alphabetical Listings. Click on &quot;Edit this page.&quot;  Locate the correct place to enter your school in alphabetical order.  Enter the following:  [[Guide to Schools/Alphabetical/&lt;Name of your school&gt;|&lt;Name of your school&gt;]] You must do this exactly. If not, either what appears on the page will be wrong or the link will not appear correctly.  Example: If the school you want to enter is &quot;Gateway Academy&quot; then your entry will be [[Guide to Schools/Gateway Academy|Gateway Academy]] 

Step 2: Click on &quot;Show Preview&quot; and see if this shows correctly.  The name of your school should now appear in red -- not blue -- in the proper location. Look for &quot;Gateway Academy&quot; in red. If it does not appear that way, click on &quot;cancel,&quot; and start over.  If it looks as it should, except that the name of your school is in red, not blue, click on &quot;Save Page.&quot;

Step 3: Now click on the link in red that you just created.  This brings you to a page with &quot;Guide to Schools/&lt;Name of your School&gt;&quot; at the top, and a notice that says &quot;You've followed a link to a page that doesn't exist yet.&quot;  
In the box below, enter in the upper left corner: {{subst:Template:School outline}}  and click &quot;show preview&quot;  Our template outline for a school description should have appeared.  If so, click &quot;Save page.&quot; If not, click &quot;Cancel and start over&quot; 

Step 4: Go back to Alphabetical listings, click on &quot;Edit this page&quot; highlight your entry of the name of the school and follow your computer's procedure for putting the entry into your copy buffer.    

Step 5:  Go to the appropriate place for your school to appear geographically and according to type of school.  Click on &quot;edit this page&quot; in each case, and paste the entry into the page as appropriate. 

At this point, you are done.  You have the name of your school entered nthree locations in this Wikibook and a template for entering information about your school in the format of other entries. --&gt;

'''''NOTE: This is the person (Tom Croke) who started this Wikibook.  In an email from Jimmy Wales today (March 7, 2003) I was warned that this Wikibook in this format might be subject to deletion if not converted into a format that is more obviously a textbook.  I will begin that task over the next few months, although I can't fully deliver on that as soon as might be desired. ''''' 

This Wikibook was started by [http://www.familylight.com Tom Croke of FamilyLight Educational Consulting] on October 29, 2005, in the hope of inspiring a comprehensive guide to schools and other related resources. On March 7, 2006, Tom was notified that the book needed to be converted to a textbook format in order to remain. Hopefully by the time you look at this, it will contain the collective wisdom of hundreds, perhaps thousands of parents, students, educators, psychologists, school and treatment facility officials, educational consultants, advocacy groups and others from all walks of life -- including much that is beyond the concept and the competence of the person who started this Wikibook. Hopefully at that time it will be usable as text in a class for parents learning to plan their children's education, for adults seeking to continue their education, and for professionals guiding educational planning.  Much of the reference material will remain as an appendix.  

As this book grows, it may be divided into several books, focusing on planning in various areas of education.  We'll start as one book and see how it grows.  

If you are planning to teach a course, hopefully this will be of use to you.  After you have used the book for that purpose, hopefully you and your students will discover ways to improve it and will make suggestions on the discussion page, or, better yet, dig in and make the improvements yourself. 

If you are struggling with planning someone's education, hopefully you can turn this into a self-taught course (and you to can improve on the book through your experience) 

If you are just looking for resources, the resource appendices will still be of help.  If you are thinking of contributing, contributors, know that you are welcome, no matter who you are or what your experience.  Please look at “Discussion” before you contribute so you know the thoughts and concerns of readers and of the contributors who came before you, and you can be aware of context as you proceed.   

Please also click on “Discussion” at the top of this page to comment on what you see, to offer suggestions and to learn the thinking behind this Wikibook.

Wikibooks requires that all contributions to these pages keep to a neutral point of view (NPOV).  There will be disagreement between contributors, and readers will sometimes benefit from knowing about it. Hopefully contributors who see something they don’t agree with will not edit that out but enter a comment of the form, “some people believe X and others believe Y.”  That keeps it neutral, but the alternative points of view are made visible to readers.

Hopefully you will all benefit from the accumulated wisdom here and you will also add to it from your own experience.

Schools and other resources appropriate this wikibook, are listed in each section below.  In the first, they are arranged geographically.  If you are listing a school, please enter it in all three areas.  If you are looking for a school we hope you will find one of these approaches convenient.

===[[Guide to Schools/Types of Schools|Listing by Type of School]]===

===[[Guide to Schools/Alphabetical |Alphabetical Listing]]===

The difference between special schools and treatment facilities can be very small and is a gray area.  At this time, we are growing this ebook as a reference on both.  As information is filled in and this wikibook becomes more complete and less of a stub, it may become appropriate to divide this ebook into two or more ebooks, or even a separate bookshelf.  But while this is a stub, it might all stay together.  Contributors:  If a section below becomes too large, substitute the template, &quot;States by Region.&quot; Also make sure the school you add is linked both in &quot;Geographic Listing&quot; and in &quot;Listing by Type of School.&quot;

An Educational Consultant is a professional person who helps parents and students plan education and select appropriate schools and colleges.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Purpose and task outline for book ==

I originally intended to create a guidebook that others and other resources for young people that might expand in any direction involving information about schools. Jimmy Wales email of March 7, 2006, that we were subject to deletion if not more of a textbook changed my course.  

My own contributions to the Appendices will be primarily information for people looking for schools and other resources that provide special services for young people with behavioral and emotional problems. (That was initially intended to be the entirety of the book) I will write some pieces for the Textbook chapters, but the only one I have the knowledge to fully develop will be on special needs.  Contributions of others will be important in all areas. 

Others may expand this in other directions. 

To know about me, see http://www.familylight.com.  I would encourage other contributors to be consistent with the format I establish or to add to it.  I am not suggesting that others should not innovate -- that would be going against the purpose of wikibooks.  What I am asking is that we can maintain some consistency in how the data is listed.

==If you want to add a school to Appendix A ==
'''Contributors, please read!'''     

If you wish to add a school, please do as follows for sake of consistency: (I personally prefer that you log in first, but that is not required.) If you think you can improve this procedure, it is your privilege to do that under the rules of Wikibooks, but lets hope for a sense of collaboration among the contributors.  As time passes, I am sure there will be improvements on this suggested approach.  I encourage contributors to be familiar with the existing procedure before improving upon it. 

'''''BEFORE YOU START'''''  Decide where your entry link will go.  I am suggesting that every school or treatment resource have its own module, so the question is, where does it link?  If you are adding to a category of school that is not well developed, I suggest putting it on the main page under the heading for that category. Once a category develops ten or more links, I suggest creating a link for that category to separate module for that category with the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Template:School outline}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; substituted in the module.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''''To add a separate module for a category:'''''  
&lt;br&gt;
'''step 1:''' Click on the edit symbol on the right side of the screen slightly above the name of the category you are working with.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;'''step 2:''' Change the name of the catgory to a link.  If the Category is &quot;Regular Schools,&quot; substitute &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;[[Guide to Schools/Regular Schools |Regular Schools]]&quot; &lt;/nowiki&gt; where it currently says &quot;Regular Schools.&quot; If there are other symbols, such as quotation marks, leave them in place outside the brackets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; '''Step 3:'''  Click on &quot;Show Preview&quot;  This should produce exactly what was there before except the name of the category is now in red rather than black. If that is not true, click on &quot;cancel&quot; and start over.  If that is true, click on &quot;save page.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  '''Step 4:''' Now click on the category, now in red. This will bring up a page with a notice that says, &quot;You've followed a link to a page that doesn't exist yet.&quot;  The title of the page will be &quot;Guide to Schools/Regular Schools&quot; In the upper left corner of the space below enter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Template:States by Region}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Click on &quot;Show Preview.&quot; You should see the standard list of states organized by region.  If not, click cancel and start over. If so, click on &quot;save page.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; '''Step 5:'''Go back to Main Page. Now move the links already under your category to their proper location on the newly created page, whose name should now show in blue on the main page. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''''To add a school:'''''

'''Step 1:'''  Open the edit or edit this page, then go to the place where you want to add the school to the site. Enter the following:  [[Guide to Schools/&lt;Name of your school&gt;|&lt;Name of your school&gt;]] You must do this exactly. If not, either what appears on the page will be wrong or the link will not appear correctly.  Example: If the school you want to enter is &quot;Gateway Academy&quot; then your entry will be &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Guide to Schools/Gateway Academy|Gateway Academy]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Step 2:''' Click on &quot;Show Preview&quot; and see if this shows correctly.  The name of your school should now appear in red -- not blue -- in the proper location. Look for [[Guide to Schools/Gateway Academy|Gateway Academy]]. If it does not appear that way, click on cancel, and start over.  If it looks as it should, except that the name of your school is in red, not blue, click on &quot;Save Page.&quot;

'''Step 3:''' Now click on the link in red that you just created.  This brings you to a page with &quot;Guide to Schools/&lt;Name of your School&gt;&quot; at the top, and a notice that says &quot;You've followed a link to a page that doesn't exist yet.&quot;  
In the box below, enter in the upper left corner &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Template:School outline}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; and click &quot;show preview&quot;  Our template outline for a school description should have appeared.  If so, click &quot;Save page.&quot; If not, click &quot;Cancel and start over&quot;

== NPOV ==

Wikibooks requires that all contributions to these pages keep to a neutral point of view (NPOV). There will be disagreement between contributors and readers will sometimes benefit from knowing about it. Hopefully contributors who see something they don’t agree with will not edit that out but enter a comment of the form, “some people believe X and others believe Y.” That keeps it neutral, but the alternative points of view are made visible to readers.

== Templates ==

Templates in use in this book are listed below, plus a &quot;template sandbox&quot; to allow contributors to experiment with Templates.  Keep in mind that anything you leave in the Template Sandbox may be erased.  [[User:Frog One|Frog One]] 23:24, 20 November 2005 (UTC)



&lt;nowiki&gt; {{Template:School outline}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; {{Template:States by Region}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;
